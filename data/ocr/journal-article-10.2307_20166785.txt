Note the relative shortness of front and back extensions of the eaves compared to more recent structures. The latter, following a style that has developed in the Rantepao area, typically have much longer and more dramatically pointed eaves. The new dominance of Rantepao carpenters has also tended to produce a more standardized style of house carving than formerly. On older buildings carving tends to be sparser and more restrained, although its absence here may also indicate that the house belonged to commoners or less wealthy members of the nobility.</page><page sequence="2">The house and the world The symbolism of Sa'Dan Tor aja house carvings ROXANA WATERSON The finely built houses of the Sa'dan Toraja are a conspicuous feature in the dramatic mountainous landscape of these northern highlands of the province of South Sulawesi (Indonesia).1 More than that, they play a central role in society as a focus of kinship groupings and as embodiments of a traditional system of rank that has parallels in many other Indonesian societies. It is not surprising that they should have attracted the admiration of outsiders and been the subject of various short publications by Torajans themselves.2 The largest and most elaborately carved and painted Toraja houses are the tongkonan, or family origin houses, of the nobility (see inside front cover). Toraja society was divided traditionally into broad categories of nobles, commoners, and slaves. Only the small group of highest-ranking nobles, the so-called tana' bulaan or "golden stake," had the privilege of covering their houses with carving. Lesser nobles, the tana' bassi or "iron stake," could carve the upper part of the house fa?ade only; the majority of the population left their houses unadorned.3 In parts of Tana Toraja, it is only the carved houses of the nobility that are graced with the title of tongkonan, and it is these which have been the focus of attention both for Torajan and for foreign researchers. In precolonial Toraja society, political power was localized among more or less autonomous villages or groups of villages, each governed by a noble family whose leading member was chosen, by the rest of the house descendants, to occupy the tongkonan.4 These ruling houses were termed tongkonan layuk or "great origin-house." The heavily decorated tongkonan layuk, huge by comparison with the majority's humbler bamboo or plain wood houses, dominated its community both visibly and politically. This use of houses as advertisement for the power of a ruling nobility is a theme interestingly explored by Feldman in the case of another hierarchical Indonesian society? Nias (see Res 7/8, spring/autumn 1984). It might, then, be imagined that origin-houses mean little to ordinary people. But in fact every Toraja man or woman, no matter how humble, traces descent bilaterally through the houses where parents, grandparents, and more distant ancestors were born, and derives a sense of identity from belonging to them. Throughout their lives, people maintain ties with a number of such houses ? ties that are largely expressed in terms of ceremonial obligations and contributions toward the periodic expenses of rebuilding. At some time in the past, the number of "ruling" houses came to be regarded as fixed, and there are no new ones today. But any house over time may come to be regarded as an origin-house for the immediate family 1. I conducted fieldwork in Tana Toraja in 1978-1979 with the aid of a grant from the then Social Science Research Council of the U.K. I returned there in 1982-1983 with the help of a British Academy Southeast Asian Fellowship and a Cambridge University Evans Fellowship. I am deeply grateful to these bodies for their support. I express my thanks also to the Indonesian Institute of Social Sciences (UPI) for granting their permission to carry out the research. I am grateful to Professors Michael Meister, Francesco Pellizzi, and Remo Guidieri for their comments on an earlier version of this paper. 2. For works by Torajan authors, see Kadang (1960), Pakan (1973), Tandilangi' (1975), and Tangdilintin (1976, 1978). Works by non-Torajans that touch on the subject of the tongkonan include Nooy-Palm (1979), Volkman (1980, 1985), and Crystal (1985). See also the excellent article by Zerner (1983) on the temporary architecture of ritual structures. I have discussed at greater length elsewhere the place of ancestral houses in present-day Toraja society, and the role played by houses in the Toraja kinship system (Waterson 1984b, 1986). 3. Rules about the amount of carving permitted are less strictly followed today. With increasing social mobility, new wealth is very frequently displayed in the highly approved form of renewal of old ancestral houses. Today, many people have built themselves houses more grand than would formerly have been permitted them by the nobility, who had the power to exact substantial fines from those who infringed the adat (or customary regulations). The aristocracy is nonetheless still powerful, since they remain the major landowners in Toraja, and most government administrators are selected from former ruling families. They still maintain their old origin-houses, although frequently choosing to reside in more spacious modern houses nearby. 4. An exception to the picture of uncentralized political power is provided by the three southernmost districts of Toraja, which formed a federation called the Tal lu Lembangna. The nobility here have long intermarried with the ruling families of Islamic kingdoms in South Sulawesi, and they were more autocratic. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, various warlords, enriched by a trade in coffee and slaves to the lowlands, had also begun to seize large territories for themselves ? a process that was halted by the coming of the Dutch. This period in Toraja history is admirably analyzed by Bigalke (1981).</page><page sequence="3">36 RES 15 SPRING 88 Three ancestral tongkonan (origin-houses) at Lemo, recently renewed with the aid of government funds and now designated National Monuments. (All photographs are by the author, except for photograph on page 38.) descended from it. It is chiefly through repeated rebuilding that a house comes to have this status; reconstruction therefore takes place not just for essential practical reasons, but whenever the descendants of the house feel they can afford it. Houses are the sites for major ritual performances; many emigrant Torajans continue to contribute large sums to the upkeep of their origin-houses, and return long distances to take part in ceremonies connected with them. When they marry, a couple take on ritual responsibilities to the origin houses of both the wife and the husband, and it is considered wrong not to contribute equally to both sides. Writings on the meaning of Toraja house carvings to date are fragmentary and sometimes confusing. In one Torajan publication, for example, the carving motifs illustrated are not the same as the ones discussed in the text, while in another, the significance of a particular explanation or association of ideas is often far from obvious to the reader.5 The subject is touched on, rather than dealt with in depth, in the publications of other researchers. This being the case, a closer investigation is called for, although I would add that my own observations are far from exhaustive. More work remains to be done on this still flourishing art form. The origins of house carving The Sa'dan Toraja number around 330,000 and occupy the present-day administrative district of Tana Toraja in northern South Sulawesi. They are for the most part subsistence farmers, growing rice in rain-fed hill terraces, along with subsidiary crops such as cassava, maize, and other vegetables. Livestock, in the form of buffaloes and pigs, play an important sacrificial role in the elaborate ceremonies for which the Toraja are well known. An important factor in the modern economy of the area is the great number of emigrant Torajans living and working in other parts of the archipelago, most of whom remit part of their earnings to relatives at home. In some areas, where rice land is in particularly short supply, nearly all young people of both sexes have left their villages to work elsewhere. Although over half of the population today is Christian, the remainder still adhere to the indigenous religion, the Aluk To Dolo or "Way of the Ancestors," which is concerned with the maintenance, through ritual, of relationships with deities and ancestors who ensure 5. Pakan (1973); Kadang (1960).</page><page sequence="4">Waterson: The house and the world 37 fertility and good health for the living. Ceremonies, particularly funerals, play such an important part in the economic and social life of the community that they remain important social occasions even for those who are now Christian. With improving economic circumstances over the last two decades, there has been an upsurge in rebuilding of traditional origin houses. The ceremonies marking completion of such projects also continue to be held ? with or without adaptations and the addition of Christian prayers of thanksgiving, depending on the religious affiliation of the participants. According to myth, the ancestor Tangdilino' was the first human on earth to construct a house that could be termed a tongkonan. Importantly, this was the first house to have ceremonies performed for it; it was also the first to be carved. Although some say that house carving was the creation of the deity Puang Matua, the "Old Lord" of the heavens, others credit the invention to a woman, Malalun Sanda. Some say that, having had the idea, she enlisted the help of carpenters to carry it out. According to a variant told to me by the late to minaa (priest) Saleda of Talion, Malalun Sanda accompanied Tangdilino"s carpenters into the forest to cook for them while they felled wood for his house. One day, she sat upon some planks. She was menstruating, and her blood left patterns on the wood. Using these patterns, the carpenters then produced the first house carvings. The story suggests a transformation of natural, female creative powers into the male, and cultural, art of carving.(&gt; In a more historical vein, it is often stated that in earlier times carpenters expended their skills on the carving of erong, large wooden coffins with decorated lids, which were placed in the rocks outside the village of the owners and used by a family over generations. At some point the use of these coffins was abandoned in favor of inaccessible tombs called Hang, cut out of sheer cliff faces or huge boulders.7 This change is sometimes linked to the acquisition of iron tools; more often it is said to be in response to seventeenth-century incursions by the Buginese, who ransacked coffins and stole the gold and precious objects placed with the 6. Such underlying oppositions between male/female, nature/culture are not, however, much elaborated in Toraja symbolic systems. Menstruation itself is totally free of any prohibitions or ideas about pollution, but rather has a positive value in its association with fertility. The latter theme is perhaps the most significant one here. 7. Most Hang are reachable only by tall bamboo ladders erected when access is desired for the interment of a new corpse. The door of the Hang is cunningly fastened by a concealed bolt on the inside. dead. According to Zerner, Torajans learnt the techniques of forging from the smiths of Seko and Luwu', to the north and east, where there are extensive deposits of iron ore and nickelous iron. It was from these highly skilled smiths that they also obtained the much-valued heirloom swords called la'bo to dolo (Zerner 1981: 95-97). Zerner does not, unfortunately, discuss the question of the date by which Torajans may have obtained tools capable of working the rock to make Hang, although it seems likely that they would have had them earlier than the seventeenth century. However this may be, it is apparently around this time that house carving began to develop as an alternative outlet for the skills of Torajan carpenters. The few remaining examples of erong provide interesting evidence for changes in carving styles. A magnificent example, with a design of nagas or water serpents, may be seen in the National Museum in One of the three ancestral tongkonan at Lemo (see above).</page><page sequence="5">38 RES 15 SPRING 88 A very finely carved Toraja coffin, now in the collection of the UCLA Museum.

Jakarta; another, in the UCLA Museum of Cultural History, is illustrated in the catalogue of a recent exhibition (Feldman 1985: 144). A few remain in situ in Tana Toraja. The lids of these coffins, with their upturned ends, echo the shape of boats or of house roofs. Although some of the elements are recognizably similar to house-carving motifs, the overall style of the carvings is much more fluid and less rigidly symmetric than present-day house-carving style, and in some cases suggests a closer link with the flowing, curvilinear styles of Borneo peoples. Orientations: the world, the house, and the body It is worth giving some idea here of the layout of the house, since it follows strict rules that accord with Toraja concepts of cosmology (see inside back cover). House orientations in Indonesian societies are very rarely random, although there is much variation both in conception of space and direction, and in the way in which houses are fitted into any particular society's cosmological schema.8 For the Toraja as for a number of other Indonesian groups, the most significant directions are east and west, the directions of the rising and setting sun, whose passage through the sky reflects the course of an individual's own life. Toraja houses always face to the north, a direction associated, like the east, with life, and specifically with the creator deity, Puang Matua. East is associated with the deities (deata) and with the rising sun. Traditionally the hearth was in the central room of the house, on the east side; the afterbirths of newborn babies are always buried in the ground on the east side of the house. West, by contrast, is the direction associated with death, the setting sun, and the ancestors. The south is the direction of the afterlife, Puya, where the bombo (an aspect of the dead person's spirit that exactly resembles them) lives a shadowy, fireless replica of life on earth. According to traditional ideas, funeral sacrifices of buffaloes and pigs accompany a deceased person into the afterlife, providing him or her with wealth there. Formerly strict rules regulated the number of sacrifices to which a person was entitled, depending on the person's rank, thus ensuring the reproduction of the earthly hierarchy after death. After a long time, and with the assistance of further rituals performed for them by their relatives, the dead are thought to become deified, eventually passing beyond Puya into a more abstract, amorphous state, 8. See, for example, Schulte Nordholt (1971), Hicks (1976), Wessing (1978), Forth (1981), Ellen (1986).</page><page sequence="6">Waterson: The house and the world 39 where they will be at one with the deata, the stars, and the heavens. They then reach the West, the direction associated with ancestors in their deified form. Old chants describe how they return to the earth in the form of rain, causing the crops to grow. As in most indigenous religions of Indonesia, followers of the Aluk To Dolo felt a very intimate association with the ancestors, who had the power to aid their descendants and enhance fertility. In some regions, only high ranking nobles are permitted to hold the ritual that ensures this transformation, so that it is only they who have the chance to become deified. The entire ritual cycle of Toraja is divided between life-enhancing celebrations called "Rites of the East" and mortuary rituals, the "Rites of the West." It is in particular the Rites of the West that provide the arena for status competition in Toraja, each family's contributions of pigs and buffaloes at a funeral being keenly assessed by the hundreds, or thousands, of guests who may attend. Those who excel in their contributions gain great prestige and are admired for their "boldness." By contrast, Rites of the East have a strongly communal aspect and require the participation of an entire ritual community, who all are thought to benefit from the increased prosperity and well-being that the rites bring. There is, as I have argued elsewhere, some contradiction between the ideological messages contained in these two kinds of ritual: the divisive, competitive emphasis on rank in the "Western" rites versus the ?deal of shared prosperity in the "Eastern" rites (Waterson 1984a). Offerings made in or around the house always reflect the concern with cardinal points?those to the deities being made facing to the north, east, or northeast, and those to the ancestors to the south, west, or southwest. The north end of the house is compared with the head of the body, and the north fa?ade is called its "face" (Undo banua). If the terrain permits, the rice barn (alang), which resembles a miniature house, is built facing it. The south is called polio' banua, or "posterior of the house." North is also called ulu uai, or "heads of the rivers," while south is polio' uai, or "tails of the rivers." The river Sa'dan itself, after which the Sa'dan Toraja call themselves, does in fact flow north-south. West and east are identified with the left and right hands of the body; rituals of West and East, too, are sometimes referred to as Rites of the "Left" or of the "Right." The colors with which the incised house carvings are painted ? white, yellow, red, and black? likewise have their directional associations reflected in their uses in ritual contexts. White is the color of Puang Matua, yellow of the deata. These are the predominant colors of costumes and decorations in rituals of the East, while red and black are the colors used for funeral decorations and costumes. Major origin-houses of the highest nobility (those houses that once were the seats of political power over their respective communities) are further distinguished by having a "navel." These houses are called tongkonan layuk, or "great houses"; they have a large central pile called the a'riri posi', or "navel post," that is sometimes personified as being either "male" or "female." This extra post is not essential to the structure of the house and is actually Evidence of an earlier carving style may be seen in the sinuous, curvilinear patterns on this fragment of an old coffin (erong) at Ke'te Kesu'.

In this western part of Toraja, houses of origin may be designated "male" or "female" depending on whether the main founding ancestor was a man or a woman. (Each house has a pair of founders, man and wife, but if it was built on land belonging to the woman's family, she is remembered as the main founder). The central "navel post" of this house also has breasts sculpted on it. Of particular interest is the unusual band of oval motifs on either side of the breasts. It is strongly reminiscent of open oval designs that occur widely in the archipelago as female symbols, especially in jewelry (see Rogers 1985). " "t ??i 11 fy J I I V? m M *?

The Toraja writer Pakan evokes additional bodily associations when he claims that the pair of sunburst designs (barre alio) that fill the topmost triangle of the house fa?ade serve as the "eyes" of the building, while designs representing the ears of buffalo (pa'talinga tedong) are always positioned at the corners of a building where they act as its "ears" (Pakan 1973: 33). A design called pa'kalungkung, representing buffalo's hooves, I was told, stands for strength and firmness, like the foundation-stones on which the house-piles rest; this design is generally placed along the side walls of a house. Such associations of house and body are frequent in Indonesian societies, as elsewhere, although they are perhaps less elaborated here than, for example, among the Sumbanese, as described by Forth, or the Belu of Timor, described by Hicks (Forth 1981; Hicks 1976).1* The personification of the house as a supposedly living entity was brought home to me when I witnessed offerings being made after an old tongkonan was accidentally destroyed by fire in 1982; one of the participants described the buffalo sacrificed on this occasion as being the house's kinallo ("food for the journey") to the afterlife, just as buffaloes sacrificed for human beings at their funerals are supposed to accompany them. Others stressed that the rite ensured the continuity of the house, until it could be rebuilt, rather than its "death," since a house, at least in name, is never allowed to disappear. House carvings and their meanings The words used for "carving" in the Sa'dan Toraja language are sura' or uki'. A carved house?hence, a noble one?is called banua sura'. Both words may also be used to mean "painting" or "writing" (the Toraja, unlike the Bugis and Makassarese, did not have any indigenous script at the time of Dutch takeover in 1906, although some Torajan nobles were literate in Buginese). According to Tammu and Veen, masura' also has the meaning of "colored," while paruki' can also mean "to weave," or "a cloth with a woven pattern" (Tammu and Veen 1972: 582, 683). The four kinds of paint used to color the carvings are made from 9. See also Covarrubias (1937: 88) on the Balinese house courtyard as body.

Today commercial paints are also starting to be used. Anyone attempting to discover the meanings behind Toraja carving motifs is faced with a diversity of partial explanations. In fact few people are capable of providing any explanation at all for any but a few of the most obvious designs, and carpenters themselves may have little to say about them. It was a long time before I found any individuals who were able to offer fuller insights into the significance of the designs taken as a whole. The most frequently proffered explanations dwell upon wealth and status. Pictures of buffaloes, for example, are said to represent the hope for many buffaloes, while carvings of gayang (gold daggers) or lola' (a kind of ornament, like an oversized gold bracelet, used as a decoration in certain rituals) are representations of valued heirlooms belonging to noble houses?indicators of wealth and high rank, as well as of the right and the ability to hold expensive rituals in which these items are displayed. More abstract symmetrical patterns, such as pa'pollo' gayang (kris handles), are described as representing the nobility and bravery of the house's descendants. A motif called pa'batang rara (beads of a gold necklace) likewise represents a part of the family's heirloom wealth, while simultaneously the idea of many small beads joined together expresses the hope for numerous descendants. Other common designs, such as curved, spreading horns (pa'tanduk ra'pe) and cocks' feathers (pa'bulu londong), are described as representing wealth, nobility, or bravery (although some people also stress the importance of buffaloes and chickens in the making of offerings). Common abstract designs relating to buffaloes also include the pa'tedong tumuru tombang (buffalo lying in a wallowing hole) and pa'tedong tumuru tanete (buffalo lying on top of a hill). Various explanations of these were suggested, ranging from a desire for many buffaloes to the idea that after work, one must also allow oneself time to rest. Straightforwardly pictorial scenes are sometimes added along the sides of a house, depicting men kickfighting, a buffalo with an egret on its back, a woman feeding a pig, men on horseback, and so on. Although somewhat crudely rendered, these scenes often have a sort of playfulness about them which suggests that the carpenter was enjoying himself, quite apart from any deeper symbolic considerations. At the very top of the fa?ade of a house or barn is found a design of two sunbursts (pa'barre alio) surmounted by cocks. Again, some say that these are emblems of high rank, greatness, or bravery. Naturalistic design of a woman feeding a pig, on the side wall of a house at Talonge, Ulusalu.</page><page sequence="11">44 RES 15 SPRING 88 Traditionally, only those of the highest rank had the right to have a cockfight as part of their funeral celebrations; some say this is why the cock is to be seen on the front of the house. Others suggest that the cock represents traditional law (one way of settling disputes in the past was by means of a cockfight), while the sun on which he stands represents Toraja itself. An old poetic name for Toraja territory is tondok lepongan bulan, tana matarik alio, which means "village of the circle of the moon, land of the circle of the sun." One person suggested that the two sunbursts stood for the totality of Rites of the West and of the East (Aluk Rampe A man on horseback, carved on the side wall of a house at Talonge, Ulusalu. In the past, the aristocracy used to ride around their fields on horseback, and the owners of certain great origin-houses obliged passers-by to dismount as a sign of respect. Matampu'/Aluk Rampe Matallo), the words for "west" and "east" meaning literally the places of the setting or the rising sun. Certain designs undoubtedly have a long history, although just how long is difficult to say with accuracy. In the early decades of this century, Heine-Geldern, Heger, and others traced an association between geometric and spiral motifs in Indonesia and motifs of the Bronze Age culture of Dong Son, which flourished in North Vietnam in the period roughly 400 b.c a.d. 100. The patterns incised on the famous bronze drums of this culture, which were traded all through the Indonesian islands, attracted particular attention.10 Several, in fact, appear identical to Toraja carving motifs. Vroklage illustrates a selection of these motifs in an interesting, although now rather questionable, paper on the origins of Indonesian house styles (Vroklage 1936: 716) (see fig. 12). The above authors, developing an idea first put forward by the Sarasin brothers, conceived a theory of the settlement of Indonesia by two or more great waves of migration from the Southeast Asian mainland, one of which consisted of bearers of the Dong Son culture. Modern assessments of Indonesian prehistory, however, dismiss this wave theory as highly unlikely and postulate that trade contacts more likely accounted for the spread of cultural items and ideas." It seems certain now that the influence of Dong Son culture in Indonesia has previously been overestimated, though; as Bellwood has pointed out, Dong Son style may have spread over a very wide area, without necessarily being everywhere the product of the same cultural group (Bellwood 1985). Apart from the possibility of independent invention of designs, lack of evidence makes it impossible to say just how much Toraja designs might owe to the influence of the Dong Son style. With some other designs we are on firmer ground. Certain house carving patterns are also to be found on old textiles stored as family heirlooms and used in rituals. Crystal points out that a cross-shaped pattern called pa'doti was derived from imported Indian silks, which belong to a category of textiles called maa' by Torajans. These silks, says Crystal, sometimes schematically depict the architecture of Hindu-Buddhist religious sanctuaries, or suggest the union of male female elements in Shivaistic belief (Crystal 1979: 58; 1985: 25). The word doti in Toraja today (apart from a 10. Heger (1902); Heine-Geldern (1966). 11.

Engraved motifs from bronze drums of the Dong Son culture (c. 400 b.c.-a.d. 100) (after Vroklage 1936:716). Some of the designs are virtually identical with present-day Toraja house carving motifs (especially (e), (i), (k), (p), and (t)). Elements of Dong Son style spread quite widely through the archipelago, although the impact of Dong Son culture per se is now thought to have been much less direct and less significant than has previously been supposed.</page><page sequence="13">46 RES 15 SPRING 88 Some house carving motifs appear to have been adopted from textiles. Indigo batik designs on this old Toraja sarita cloth include the cross-shaped pa'doti motif (thought to have been derived originally from Indian textiles), the key-pattern called pa'sekong kandaure, also found on beadwork ornaments, and a design very similar to the "buffalo's ears" motif (pa'talinga tedong). The border shows horsemen and a ploughing scene. (Collection: National Museum of Singapore) distinct meaning of "love magic"), means "spotted," "favorable," or "star," and the design, commonly called pa'doti langi' (langi' = "sky"), is described as being "like stars in the sky." Doti may also refer to a spotted buffalo, the kind most highly valued by Torajans. Tammu and Veen add that in the westerly area around Rembon, doti langi' is also another name for maa' cloths, which were believed to have been made in the sky (Tammu and Veen 1972: 145). One could perhaps go further and interpret this design as a variant of the Hindu four-five pattern, which represents the four cardinal points arranged around a central fifth point. The layout of religious buildings often consciously echoed this cosmological schema, which assumed considerable significance not only for sacred sites but also in Hinduised political systems of Southeast Asia. In them, the ruler or his capital was conceptualized as the powerful center of the world, channeling supernatural force from the heavens and dispersing it throughout the kingdom (Anderson 1972; Parkin 1978: 213). The layout of Javanese villages in conformity with the four/five schema was noted by van Ossenbruggen in an early article of 1918, and its recurrence in the layout of houses and villages, or in political structures, in diverse parts of Indonesia has been remarked on by various writers (see, for example, Josselin de Jong (1952: 153) on Minangkabau and Negri Sembilan; Schulte Nordholt (1971) on the Atoni of Timor; Wessing (1978) on Sunda; Forth (1981: 124, 241) on eastern Sumba). Indonesia's outer islands mostly absorbed these Hindu The pa'doti langi' motif, derived from patterns on Indian textiles that according to Crystal (1979) schematically depict the floor plans of religious sanctuaries. For Torajans, however, the pattern represents stars or the spots on piebald buffalo (the most highly valued form of wealth in Toraja).</page><page sequence="14">Waterson: The house and the world 47 Detail of the fa?ade of a tongkonan at Pattan, Ulusalu, showing the eight-pointed motif, of Hindu origin, which Torajans call pa'kapu' baka.

It is noticeable that any idea of the original meaning of the designs appears to have been lost in Toraja.12 A second design with likely Hindu origins is the pa'kapu' baka ("bindings of a lidded basket"). This kind of basket is used for the storage of heirlooms ? especially textiles?inside the house. Nooy-Palm notes that this pattern of "loops in an octagonal arrangement" occurs in Bali under the name windu, and among the Toba Batak under the name bindu matoga.]i In both these places, she states, it has associations with the underworld, although she suggests this association has been lost in Toraja. Instead it has become "a symbol of prosperity" (Nooy-Palm 1979: 293). In fact, the design in both Bali and Toba is again a representation of the cardinal points, here expanded to eight around a central ninth point. The word bindu or windu derives from the Sanskrit bind?, "power-point," while Toba matoga means "powerful." Bindu matoga is thus the "powerful power-point." When the Toba use an eight point system of directions, the names for the points are all derived from Sanskrit (Parkin 1978: 200). The loops at the corners of the design symbolize continuity ? the whole having neither beginning nor end. As well as being regarded as the most important of all Toba house carving motifs (Niessen 1985: 208) the design also played a crucial role in the bius ceremony, a rite of renewal held at the turn of the agricultural year. It was drawn on the ground, a representation of the naga or underworld serpent was drawn within it, and an egg was placed in the center. Tobing, who gives a detailed account of this ceremony, states that the eight-pointed design represents the middle world, while the naga stands for the deity of the underworld, thought to control the passage of the seasons (Tobing 1956: 169).14 According to Tobing, three datu, or priests, 12. The influence of Sanskrit in the everyday Toraja vocabulary appears to be rather slight compared to some other Indonesian languages (Gonda 1952; Parkin 1978), but Sanskrit-derived words do occur in the esoteric language of ritual verse. One leading exponent of the traditional Toraja religion, Pak Kila' BA, estimates that as much as 10 percent of this ritual vocabulary may derive from Sanskrit. 13. An illustration of such a design occurring in an Indian context may be found in Hakansson (1977: 85). See Lansing (1974) for a discussion of the Balinese windu. The Toba motif, which very closely resembles the Toraja one, is well illustrated in Niessen (1985: 209). 14. See Barbier (1983: 164) on Tobing's staging of a reconstructed version of this rite in 1953, in which he himself participated.</page><page sequence="15">48 RES 15 SPRING 88 Female descendants of Nonongan, wearing beadwork kandaure heirloom treasures, wait to welcome guests at the ceremony. The guests included representatives of the royal families of the Islamic South Sulawesi kingdoms of Goa, Bone, and Luwu'. They all recognize descent from Laki Padada, a widely renowned mythical ancestor who features in Nonongan's genealogy. These royal families have also intermarried with the Torajan nobility over a long period. Note the "hooked" designs on the kandaure, which are repeated in house carving designs named after them (pa'sekong kandaure). danced around the figure and one of them ended by plunging his magic staff (representing the Toba "tree of life") into the egg. The drawing was finally erased with the bodies of a sacrificed dog and cock. The rite was an acting out of the destruction and recreation of the cosmic order, warding off harm and bringing blessing, and ensuring the continuation of the annual cycle. As Tobing puts it, "The end of the year is the cosmic destruction and renewal at the same time. The tree of life dies, a new one develops from the same trunk, nourished by the fruit fallen from the old tree" (Tobing 1956: 173). Once again we find that in Toraja the design has lost its original significance as a representation of the cardinal points and acquired an association with a familiar but valuable object, the storage-basket (see front cover). These baka both guard the treasured heirlooms from external harm and, conversely, protect people from unregulated contact with the heirlooms, some of which are considered to have supernatural power. The baskets may generally not be opened except on special ritual occasions when use of the contents is required. One old noble origin house in the Saluputti district claims to have a basket in its attic which is protected by a guardian snake, and Crystal mentions that some maa' cloths are considered so powerful that at their opening on ceremonial occasions rain quickly comes (Crystal 1979: 58). Interestingly, the location of the design on the outside of the building more or less accords with the actual placing of baka inside the house (although there is some regional variation in where this is likely to be). In some areas, valuables are placed in the attic, while in others the south room of the house, which is the most private, is the storage-place.15 The design may thus be found low down, on corners, or sometimes higher up on the 15. In the westerly part of Toraja where I did much of my fieldwork, the attic (roughly formed of planks laid over the lower roof-beams) is frequently the place where valuables are stored; but see Volkman (1985: 47-48) on the storage of heirlooms in the south room of the house in the northerly region of Sesean, and the symbolic significance of this.</page><page sequence="16">Waterson: The house and the world 49 fa?ade. My informants added further interpretations of the motif; the tightly closed basket suggests the importance of being able to keep secrets; one should not speak randomly, or in idle boast, but only with a purpose. Another design that possibly has distant origins is the pa'lembang or "boat" motif. This is often used to decorate the tulak somba', the large, freestanding pillar supporting the overhang of the roof, and it is supposed to deflect evil influences. According to some, this design is put on boats to ensure their safety; but since the Torajans today are not boat-builders (at most sometimes constructing rafts for the purpose of crossing rivers), the existence of the design may have something to do with legends according to which the ancestors of present-day Torajans came upriver in boats (and subsequently modeled their houses on the shape of these upturned vessels). The word lembang was also used to refer to communities composed of groups of villages in pre-Dutch Torajan society. The association of boats with houses and villages in other Indonesian societies is not uncommon and has been presumed by some authors to derive from memories of ancient migrations through the islands (Vroklage 1936). Gittinger, on the other hand, points out in a discussion of south Sumatran "ship textiles" and their uses in ritual that the ship lends itself as a powerful and convenient symbol of transition (Gittinger 1976: 219). The boat may also serve as a symbol of the unity of a community, even if we cannot accept the very literal picture constructed by Vroklage of boatloads of Dong Son culture-bearers landing in the Indonesian islands and establishing themselves as villages. Some elements of decoration are directly related to the house's ritual history. A wooden buffalo's head, with real horns attached, which may be affixed to the fa?ade or to the great post supporting the eaves of the roof, is called kabongo' (or, in western districts of Tana Toraja, tedong-tedong kayu or "little wooden buffalo"). It commemorates, according to the majority of my informants, the holding of a very high level (or the highest possible level) of funeral ceremony for a descendant of the house. Above the kabongo', in some cases, is fastened the figure of a bird, called katik, with a very long, curved neck and a crest or protuberance on top of its head. Many Torajans describe the bird as a "cock," but others deny this and say that it is a hornbill, or a "mythical bird of the forests." Although Carved house-front at Talonge, Ulusalu, showing the buffalo-head and katik (a long necked bird variously described as cock, mythical bird or hornbill) which indicate that descendants of the house have celebrated the highest-ranking of Toraja rituals.

This costume is worn for the performance of a war-dance, with which guests are greeted at high-ranking funeral celebrations. some people say that the katik merely represents the greatness of the highest-ranking aristocratic houses, a number of my informants more specifically explained the presence of the katik as indicating that the house owners have sponsored the highest of all of the life enhancing Rites of the East, the great ma'bua' ritual. Katik and kabongo', then, form a pair representing the totality of the Toraja ritual cycle. Traditionally, only the great noble houses called tongkonan layuk had the right to display the carved katik, since only they had the right to sponsor the ma'bua'. The importance of the katik and what it stands for is reflected in the way it is described as being the house's crowning glory, that which made it incomparable to all others (iring iringanna banua). For indeed, in terms of traditional Torajan values, there could be no achievement in life more glorious than that of reaching the highest possible levels in the ranked series of rituals of both West and East. A house thus ornamented stands as the permanent embodiment of the achievements of its descendants.u&gt; A noticeable feature of the carvings is the number of designs whose names refer to plants. These designs are mostly variations on a spiral motif and are used on lower portions of the fa?ade and sides of a house or barn. Some of these motifs, such as pa'barana' (banyan), pa'daun bolu (betel leaves), or pa'lolo tabang (Cordyline shoots), represent obviously impressive or ritually important plants. In Kesu', the banyan is planted in connection with the holding of the ma'bua' (Nooy-Palm 1979: 219) ? although in other regions it is the sandalwood tree. The great size and luxuriant foliage of the banyan tree, according to some, expresses the hope of prosperity, while in funeral chants a wealthy and important aristocrat may be described as bar ana' Ian tondok, "a banyan tree (leader) in the village." Betel and areca nut are always used in making offerings. Tabang, the Cordyline plant, with its red leaves, is widely used to decorate structures used in life-enhancing Rites of the East, and its leaves are believed to have healing properties. Pa'tukku pare, a design of "bowed heads of rice," is clearly understandable as an expression of hope for abundance. A motif of small white circles containing black lozenges is called pa'bua kapa' (cotton pods) and is said to represent the hope for sufficient clothing. But a number of other patterns are derived from more humble or obscure plants: pa'tangke lumu' (stalks of a trailing weed that grows in ponds and fallow rice 16. I deal more fully elsewhere with the question of the katik's significance (Waterson, forthcoming).</page><page sequence="18">Waterson: The house and the world 51 Side of a granary in Ke'te' Kesu' showing infill panels of spiral designs interspersed with buffalo-head patterns on the weight-bearing wall studs.

Although some of these plants are useful insofar as they are occasionally eaten as vegetables, they can hardly be described as prestigious. In the same way, while living creatures such as buffaloes, horses, or fowl are obviously desired items of wealth, what, we may ask, is so special about tadpoles, crabs, and water-boatmen that they should give their names to carving motifs? Part of the answer would seem to lie in associations with water, and hence with life, fertility, and flourishing rice-fields (see back cover). Through their associations with water, the humble tadpole and water-weed represent the hope that descendants of the house will have large rice-fields, in which these plants and creatures commonly flourish in the fallow season. The association with fertility is enhanced by the fact that both tadpoles and water-weed multiply or spread very rapidly or in large numbers; they thus provide suitable images in which to express the hope for many descendants. Kangkung likewise not only grows very quickly but flourishes also in damp or waterlogged places. Several of the plants (such as pumpkin, paria, or lamban lalan) are of the trailing, vinelike type that also spread widely. The design of pumpkin stalks, I was told, represents the hope that the descendants of a house will multiply rapidly but remain united, just as the pumpkin's long, trailing vines remain attached to the main stem. Ferns also spread and grow rapidly, and are said never to die out even in periods of dry weather; they thus have similar associations. Some say that the water-boatman, which darts rapidly across the surface of the water and never sinks, stands for the hope that the fortunes of the house, too, will never sink. Fern shoot motifs are in fact very widespread in island Southeast Asia as a symbol of fertility, occurring, for example, among the Minangkabau in both textile and house carving patterns under the name kuluak paku, as well as on stone menhirs, which probably predate Islam (Sanday and Kartiwa 1984: 22-23). In house carvings of the Maranao people of Mindanao (southern Philippines), the fern motif is called piaku (Saber and Madale 1975: 30). The Simalungun Batak of north Sumatra likewise used the pumpkin vine as a symbol of fertility.

A second major category of designs is based on geometric and interlocking key patterns. Toraja explanations move here from the plant world to that of man-made objects. Some of the motifs occur on other items; for example, pa'sepu to Rongkong is supposed to resemble a design found on betel-bags (sepu) of the people of Rongkong, north of the Sa'dan area. Pa'sekong kandaure echoes the hooked designs found on beadwork heirlooms (kandaure) that are displayed and worn on ritual occasions. Pa'kadong pao ("mango hook") is named after the tall bamboo pole with a split in its end which is used for picking mangoes from high branches. "Hooked" and interlocking patterns of this type prompt different types of explanations from informants. Some say they mean that "kinsfolk should stick together" or that "everything in life is connected." Others say: "Don't be crooked in your dealings with others" (one person even volunteered the reverse: "It is unwise to be too straight in one's dealings"!), or that "everything in life will not be straightforward." Thus both positive and negative implications of a particular pattern may suggest themselves. Perhaps most significantly, one informant told me that the idea of "hooking" mangoes may be compared with other verbal expressions according to which wealth or good fortune may be "hooked by a dream" (dikadang tindo), "hooked by prayers" (dikadang pemala'), or simply "hooked by one's destiny" (dikadang dalle'). The blessings of the gods, it is believed, come to some people in this way, as if they were plucking a mango out of a high tree. The distribution of motifs So far it has become clear that any one design may have multiple referents or associations; furthermore, I believe that people may quite often extemporize in explaining the meaning of a motif. But how may one make sense of the designs taken as a whole? It is not enough to say that carvings represent features of the natural and cultural world of the Toraja; we need to see what, if anything, can be learnt from their overall arrangement. Let us look more closely at the fa?ade of the house, which is the building's main focus of attention in the eyes of Torajans. The layout of designs on the fa?ade?although, of course, the actual choice of motifs may vary somewhat?follows certain</page><page sequence="20">Waterson: The house and the world 53 important rules. The whole, as one elderly aristocrat put it to me, may be regarded as a "row of good examples" (dandanan sangka').17 Why the carvings should be regarded in this light was most vividly explained to me by Pak Ulia Salu Rapa' of Nanggala: Once, when my family was rebuilding an ancestral house in Nanggala, I said to the carpenter, "I want to change that carving (pointing to a design of betel leaves (pa'daun bolu); let's put something else there!" He was shocked, and said, "We can't! Really, it has to be like that, that's the way it's meant to be." His name was Ne' Barrang, and his craft had been handed down over generations from his ancestors. Then he explained to me why the carvings had to be arranged in a certain way . . . My grandparents really knew about the meanings of house carvings, too ? but I paid no attention to them then. At the time I just thought, "What's the point of all this?" If I had only known how our culture would come to seem so important to me! A Catholic, Pak Ulia remains a highly articulate exponent of Torajan customs (and one who is renowned for the unsurpassed magnificence of his contributions of buffaloes at funerals). His comments express his regret at the loss of much of the cultural knowledge of his grandparents' generation. He indicated that the common explanations today of designs as representations of wealth were superficial and sometimes mistaken. Some designs, he noted, such as the pictures of gold krisses (gayang), were of recent origin, and although they might displace older designs, in his opinion this merely resulted in a deterioration of the proper scheme of things. Looking at a typical house fa?ade from the bottom up, certain designs may be expected to occur in specific places. At the bottom, we frequently find the motif of spreading buffalo-horns, with rows of cocks' feathers above them. Whereas some people suggested to me that the spreading horns indicated the embracing of as much wealth as possible, Pak Ulia's interpretation was of a "gathering together" of the rapu, the group of a house's descendants. In daily life this grouping is very vaguely bounded and of little practical importance, but its existence is reaffirmed whenever its members come together for some ceremonial occasion. Rapu membership is also important when issues of inheritance arise, or when plans are made for the rebuilding of an origin-house. The cock-feather motif, 17. Dandanan sangka' is a term also used for a category of folk stories, supposedly true stories of people who experience unexpected good fortune or whose good deeds are rewarded. recalling the expression korok londong ("crowing of a cock" who calls to his hens, used metaphorically for the calling together of the rapu by its leading member), repeats this theme. Above, we find the numerous plant motifs, always carved on the wall panels or "leaves" (daunna) of the walls, and interspersed with buffalo head motifs (pa-tedong), which are always carved upon the weight-bearing wall studs (sangkinan rinding) between which the panels are fitted. The wall studs Carpenters at work on the rebuilding of tongkonan To' Kaluku Mataallo (Kesu' district), May 1983. The almost-completed fa?ade has already been raised into position, prior to completion of the roof. The distribution of designs on the fa?ade conforms to a particular pattern. The motif of cocks mounted on sunbursts may be seen in the upper triangles, and below them a broad band of the heart-shaped pa'daun bolu motif representing betel leaves, used in the making of offerings to ancestors and deities. Lower down are designs associated with the earth, especially plant-motifs and buffalo heads.</page><page sequence="21">54 RES 15 SPRING 88 with their buffalo designs represent the nobility, who have power and hold society together, while the panels with their plant motifs represent the common people. Designs such as that of water-weeds (pa'tangke lumu'), stressed Pak Ulia, also signify the unity of the rapu, for when you pull one strand of such a weed, all the others follow and cannot be separated. Higher up on the fa?ade may be found the pa'barana' (banyan) pattern, which again, he said, represented the rapu. In all this portion of the fa?ade, although not in the upper triangle, designs may be found edged with a pattern of tiny yellow triangles, representing grains of rice (pa'barra'). This section of the fa?ade, then, represents the earth, and the scattering of rice-grains serves as an appropriate reminder of the place of this all-important food in Toraja life. Higher still, below the tiny, wooden-shuttered windows, may sometimes be seen a thin band of a pattern representing swallows (pa'kalumpini'). Swallows, as other informants also pointed out, are associated with fresh, healthful air, and their presence around a dwelling is regarded as a fortunate sign. In myth, swallows act as the messengers of Puang Matua, the creator deity. Just below the topmost triangle of the fa?ade will be found the motif of betel leaves (pa'daun bolu), for betel is always used in the making of offerings and prayers to both deities and ancestors. Clearly, then, the design of two sunbursts surmounted by cocks, which fills the uppermost triangle, may be taken to represent the heavens, and from the bottom up the designs may be read as signifying the calling together of the house's descendants to make offerings to the deities. As a link between the two spheres, no design could be more appropriate than that of the betel leaf. That the cock should appear as a mediator between earth and heaven likewise comes as no surprise. In a number of myths, the protagonist (male or female according to the variant) has a cock as companion. When this person is murdered by treacherous relatives, the cock crows her (or him) back to life; he also has the power to fulfill wishes by crowing. Later they both go up into the sky, where the cock becomes a constellation whose appearance in the heavens is still awaited yearly as a sign that the time is right for sowing the rice. In fact, people quite often identify the cock that surmounts the barre alio on the house fa?ade as the cock of Tu lang Didi' or of Lapandek, two of the protagonists of these stories. One person added that the reason this cock is sometimes represented with a stalk of rice in its beak is that Tulang Didi's cock, as a constellation, follows behind another well-known constellation called Lemba' (Orion's Belt). Lemba' means "the carrying-pole" and is said to represent another mythical personage carrying rice on a pole over his shoulder. The cock follows behind in order to pick up any grains that may fall from his burden.18 When the cock crows, the sun rises; the regenerative power of the cock in myth is a reflection of this everyday experience. Through an extension of this idea of regenerative power, the cock is aptly associated (as a constellation) with the rice-growing cycle. In the broadest sense, we can interpret the theme of Toraja house carvings as one of hope for continuous renewal of fertility of the earth, most particularly of rice. For without rice, life and the ritual cycle cannot be sustained. I have tried to give some impression of the multiplicity of meanings that present-day Torajans find in their house carvings. Beyond a concern with the desire for wealth, we may read the designs in their totality as reflecting deeper themes of the continuation of life and the maintenance of communication with deities and ancestors. The house is a microcosm, its carvings reproducing in miniature an image of the cosmos, the natural world, and of human society. This should not, however, be taken to imply a tidy and unitary compression of all these "layers" of meaning into a single structure. Rather, it makes more sense to view the house, as Ellen does, as one of several "microcosms" ? the house, the village, the ritual schema, the body ? all of which feed into each other and within which the meanings of symbols or their opposition to each other may shift according to context (Ellen 1986: 3). I have suggested, for example, that there is some tension within the ritual schema in terms of the different emphases evident in the two major categories of rites. Mortuary rituals are the occasions for status competition, whereas communal prosperity becomes the theme of the life-affirming Rites of the East. In the house, as in ritual, meanings may contradict as well as complement each other, and it requires an interpretive act to "read" them from the silent structure of the house. It would be misleading, therefore, to attempt to establish one particular explanation as more valid than others. For each 18. Barbier notes that in Toba Batak house murals the cock is often portrayed with a branch in its beak. He describes this as an allusion to the "cosmic tree," prominent in both Hindu and Toba mythology, whose branches also frame the painted wall panels (Barbier 1983: 100).</page><page sequence="22">Waterson: The house and the world 55 Key to Motifs: 1.

It depicts the lady of the moon, Indo' Samadenna, with her golden spinning wheel.

The group of seven stars represents the constellation Bunga' (Pleiades); the three stars below, Lemba' (Orion's Belt); above, a single star, perhaps a planet, for which I could receive no identification. In the left corner is a sunburst. The constellations are observed to determine the correct time for beginning the agricultural cycle.

I believe that ritual plays a special role, too, in periodically giving dramatic expression to the meanings embodied in the carvings. As we have seen, this relationship between the house and its rituals is essentially a reflexive one, since some of the most conspicuous elements of house decoration in turn serve to commemorate the celebration of particular rites. Two major themes contained within the house carvings ? the expression of the unity and prestige of the rapu, and the desire for general fertility and prosperity ? are, as we have seen, closely echoed in ritual.19 In spite of the changes and redefinitions taking place in the sphere of ritual in modern-day Tana Toraja, with its now largely Christian population, its new wealth channeled home by migrants and its partially eroded social hierarchy, the importance of houses as the proper sites for these rituals appears to be undiminished. Distinctions of social status have an important bearing on the question of meaning. It is the nobility who own the carved origin-houses, and it is noticeably members of the nobility who offer interpretations of the house fa?ade as an image of society in miniature, held together by the aristocracy as represented by the powerful buffalo-head designs. A poor commoner might possibly find this interpretation less compelling, but in any case is less likely to be conversant with the meanings of the carvings.20 Again, the meaning attributed to the carvings in their totality might at first sight appear to contradict the apparently more superficial interest expressed in symbols of wealth and status, but on reflection we may judge that this is not really so. The comments of someone like Pak Ulia concerning the vulgarity of motifs symbolizing objects of wealth must, I believe, be viewed in the light of his own standing in society. His own high rank and his successful translation of wealth into ritual achievement are beyond question, and therefore he has nothing to prove. He has, as he expresses it, an obligation not to allow the prestige accumulated by his family over generations to diminish. But this aside, in explaining the significance of funeral sacrifices he prefers to stress their importance as demonstrations of sympathy with the deceased's family. Participation in funerals is for him (as most Torajans, both traditionalist and Christian, would agree) the truest expression of social sentiment. The concern with distinctions of wealth and status remains nonetheless an integral component of the Toraja worldview. The ritual system itself, with its competitive performance of ranked series of rites, is grounded in these distinctions. Rank determines what rites one is permitted to hold, and it is by conspicuous expenditure in the ceremonial arena that families and individuals may translate wealth into social prestige, simultaneously (according to the old belief) gaining the blessings of the ancestors and deities. Wealth was traditionally regarded as evidence that one had found favor with these supernatural powers.21 Within the context of pre-Christian Toraja society, ritual performances simultaneously provided both the means for the enhancement of status and the channel by which human beings maintained communication with supernatural forces. In a parallel way, house carving gave expression both to the prestige of the house's descendants and to the concern for the proper maintenance of links with the divine. 19. A rather different example of the part played by ritual in making real the symbolism of a building is provided by the Barasana. It is essentially during ritual performances that the Barasana house "becomes" the cosmos (Hugh-jones 1985: 93). 20. Yamashita notes the cynicism displayed by a poor commoner in the Mengkendek district of Toraja on the issue of the fate of the soul after death. According to "traditional" belief (which Yamashita accurately points out is largely promulgated by aristocratic priests, the to minaa), the animals sacrificed at the funeral accompany the dead into the afterlife to provide him with wealth there. Further expensive ceremonies, held only for members of the nobility, achieve the deification of the deceased some time after death. Earthly divisions are thus effectively replicated in the afterlife, since those who are rich and of high rank have the largest funerals. Yamashita's informant put it in this way: "A big funeral is a matter of the rich and the noble, not a matter for us, the small poor people. It is said |the informant emphasizedl their souls go to heaven, because they hold big rituals. But I don't know what happens to our soul if we don't have a big ceremony. How can I know it? Why don't you ask your question to the to minaa ladat specialist], not to a person like me?" Yamashita comments: "Knowledge is not evenly distributed in the whole community . . . the knowledge of adat specialists seems to represent the ideology of the rich leading class rather than that of ordinary folk" (Yamashita 1983: 19-20). It should be added that social divisions are particularly marked in the southerly regions of Toraja where Yamashita worked; a contrasting picture of the extreme state of flux existing in ritual and status hierarchies in the north of Toraja is presented by Volkman (1985). 21. Bigalke notes the account by Van de Loosdrecht, one of the first Christian missionaries to Toraja, of one of his earliest sermons there in which he chose as his theme the parable of the Rich Fool. The audience nodded approvingly on hearing of this man's great wealth and were dumbfounded at the idea that such a fortunate man could possibly be out of favor with any deity; the sermon fell flat (Bigalke 1981: 166).</page><page sequence="25">58 RES 15 SPRING 88 The question arises whether, in today's world, the significance of house carvings is changing, even while interest in rebuilding old origin-houses becomes more intense. One way for a successful migrant to convert new wealth into prestige at home is by financing the renewal of an origin-house. Torajans say they despise those who may have fine houses in the city but do nothing to improve the (to them) far more important origin-houses in their home villages. Since people trace their links bilaterally to so many houses, it is usually not difficult for an ambitious person to trace a connection to one that is in need of repair, and even if the link is a little distant, other family members are unlikely to refuse the offer. New economic conditions have produced a noticeable shift in the focus of power, since the wealthiest and most successful members of a tongkonan are today very often not the people living in it but precisely those who have left. Some newly built tongkonan are even left unoccupied, testimony no longer to the immediate power of a resident aristocrat over the lives of surrounding villagers but to the success of an absent individual in the wider sphere of the national economy or administration. The periodic return of such an individual to the house as ceremonial site serves to reaffirm not only his prestige within the local community but also no doubt his own continuing sense of identity with his place of origin. Like participation in funerals, the reconstruction of an origin house provides a dramatic means of asserting a "Toraja" identity, which now has to be defined within the context of the cultural diversity of modern Indonesia. If house carvings may have ceased for many Toraja to signify the old cosmic order, they can nonetheless still serve as a convenient expression of "Toraja-ness." As such, one may argue that the depth and resonance of the carvings' symbolism is likely to become reduced, but the continuing interest in the periodic reconstruction of origin-houses suggests that house carving in Tana Toraja is far from becoming a dying art.
