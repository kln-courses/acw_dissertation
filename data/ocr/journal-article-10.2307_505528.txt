<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Anatolia MACHTELD J. MELLINK In 1988, excavations, surveys, soil probings, and laboratory analyses progressed on a large scale. At the annual review symposium, this time held in Antalya, some 70 excavation reports, over 50 survey reports, and some 25 discussions of archaeometric research were presented. A wealth of information and prob- lems was shared in a traditional setting of great hos- pitality, this time with exploration of the Lycian blue waters. In the vast expanse of Anatolia the geographical distribution of excavations remains uneven, partly determined as it is by the urgency of rescue opera- tions. Surveys are beginning to fill in the blanks on the archaeological map, and are bringing new meth- ods to bear upon questions of settlement and devel- opment. For many periods we still have samples rather than a spatially coherent network, but through it all we discern Anatolian traits that have proved durable through intrusions and interactions with neighbors and newcomers. For the Palaeolithic stages, the Yarimburgaz cave west of Istanbul represents a second Turkish excava- tion site of great potential, in addition to the long known cave at Karain, north of Antalya, where work has been resumed. Aceramic Neolithic sites have surprises in store, as Cay6nuj and Nevalih ori demonstrate, the latter site especially through its revelation of carved stelae set up in a paved area (fig. 1). The Chalcolithic (Halaf, Ubaid) connections with North Mesopotamia have been well demonstrated in the rescue operations along the Euphrates, and in some way are precursors of the better known Late Uruk "colonization." These matters will again be prominent on the agenda of survey and selective excavation north of the newly planned dams in the Euphrates and Tigris. In the northern Euphrates area, Arslantepe-Mala- tya remains a key station for the interaction of Mesopotamian innovations and East-Anatolian- Transcaucasian native traditions. The site is well away from the dam areas and will continue to be a major source of study and reference for the entire Bronze Age, and historically also for the later period under its neo-Hittite dynasty. In the north, Ikiztepe is a somewhat solitary outpost representing a Pontic community of the Late Chal- colithic and EB-MB era with its own system of re- sources and connections; the results affect research from the Bosphorus to the East Pontic mountains, with special emphasis on metal resources and trade. Troy is being excavated selectively again after a 50- year interval in which much debate and questioning had taken place on paper and at symposia. In the field, the perspective has been sharpened by surveys, excavations at Demircihiiyiik and Begiktepe, and geo- morphological probings in the Troad. The new proj- ect aims at protection of the famous site as well as exploration of unresolved questions: Troy's coastal position and harbors in various periods; continuity and breaks in occupation and management; the ex- IKiZTEPE SAMSUN I N UL PENDIK PERINTHOS IZMIT AINOS YARIMBURGAZ AMASYA MARMAR IZNIK iNANDIK AMASYA ALA6 HUVYUK MA?AT TRO ODASKYLEION ANKARA EKSKiYAPAR PATNOS BERIKTEPE DEMiRCI HULLYUKo ORDION AZKTDY K 'AHEION ADIL CEV PERGAMON AEZANI PESSINUS RKAMANN 0 " YORTAN VANELAZI ( .._ -- S BAY R TA K L UAMORIU NKULTEPE DEIRMENTEPEP KLZI ,,,*SA RDIuS aK '-S0.

MELLINK [AJA 94 istence of a lower city in the Bronze Age; the where- abouts and nature of the cemeteries; Trojan wars in VI and VII; the Dark Ages, and, not least, the Clas- sical form of the city. The proto-Hittite and Hittite periods in Anatolia have gained in historical substance at Ktiltepe, Magat, and Bogazkby. The most remarkable recent progress is due to the epigraphic discoveries accompanying the archaeological resuscitation of the Hittite capital. The bronze tablet found near the Sphinx Gate in 1986, now fully published, has put Pamphylia and rough Cilicia firmly into the Hittite realm under the dynasty of TarhuntaSia, adjoining the plain of Cilicia in Kiz- zuwatna which was safely tied to Hittite control. The Hittite Hieroglyphic inscriptions of Tuthaliya IV at Ilgln, northwest of Konya, and those in the newly discovered built chamber of Shuppiluliuma II on the south citadel at Bogazk6y, promise historical and geo- graphical detail for the southern Hittite realm. The royal seal on two Hittite bullae from the de- struction level at Lidar on the Euphrates, newly inter- preted in its historical context by J.D. Hawkins, provides the link of the Hittite Imperial Dynasty and its viceroys with the continuing later Hittite dynasties of Carchemish and Malatya. The post-Empire history of TarhunaSia is being reexamined in this light. Thus the Dark Ages after the wars of the early twelfth century B.C. are being illuminated here and there by proofs of continuity and survival. More work is to be done, especially in central Anatolia, where at Gordion the transition from Hittites to Phrygians is being scrutinized. In the West, the Anatolian roots of Greek and Hellenistic cities are coming to light. The Lydian past of Sardis is emerging in its own grand manner; at Ephesus, the votive deposits under the Artemisium of Croesus share a Lydian and West Anatolian pedi- gree. Miletus and Old Smyrna so far are the only two sites on the West coast to give us a continuous archae- ological sequence, but with the aid of modern tech- niques more can be found out at other sites in Ionia. The range of excavation, recording, restoration, conservation, anastylosis, and protective registration of sites is enormous and impressive. The members of the archaeological service and museum staffs are watching a territory and patrimony of vast dimen- sions. The official programs of rescue excavations along the Euphrates have been productive in salvag- ing cultural history and substance. Elsewhere sites are still threatened, in Turkey as in other countries, by bulldozers preparing building sites, deep ploughs re- moving layer after layer of sites in agricultural terri- tory, and roads cutting through ancient cemeteries. These dangers were pointed out at the symposium in Antalya and losses were reported. Archaeologists are more than ever in need of the understanding and cooperation of the educated public to protect the record of the past against modern technical progress as much as against the alarming greed of international looters and collectors.

Prof. ISln Yallnkaya expanded her exca- vation in cave area A, taking further squares down through three Upper Palaeolithic and 12 Middle Pa- laeolithic levels. Chipped stone tools occur in large quantity. The most important discovery was that of a fireplace in A6-7, Middle Palaeolithic Levels 10-13; it contained fragments of charcoal, burnt animal bones, and burnt flints. The hearth was carefully built of stones laid on their flat sides; so far only part of it has been excavated. For a progress report see Sym- posium 10:1 (1988) 15-36. Yarimburgaz. Excavations of the Lower Palaeolithic deposits were started in 1988 by Professors Guven Arsebiik and F. Clark Howell. Area Y-88 yielded over 300 stone tools and worked fragments, and a series of animal bones and microfauna, all belonging to the early stages of the Lower Palaeolithic era. Laboratory analyses have not yet been completed but this cave ca. 20 km west of Istanbul appears to yield the earliest known evidence for human presence in Turkey, of a date probably more than 700,000 years ago. Gaziantep Survey. A. Minzoni-Deroche reports on her survey work in the Gaziantep region in Research Symposium 6 (1988) 591-94 and AnatSt 38 (1988) 196- 97. Aceramic Neolithic. Anatolica 15 (1988) is a special issue presenting the papers of a conference on the Aceramic Neolithic in Southeastern Turkey edited by J. Roodenberg. (ay6nii. Dr. Mehmet Ozdogan reports that the investigation of the "skull building" was brought near completion. The compartments in the substructure, partly built of large blocks, contain skulls as well as large quantities of human bones, some badly broken; a total of at least 400 individuals has by now been counted. In the center of the mound, a grill-building was analyzed; virgin soil was reached in a sizable area. Simple huts with irregular stone foundations are the earliest structures. To the west, a grill-building had a clay and limestone floor with red ocher paint. On the north side, a burnt cell-building was well preserved, with a stone-built staircase along its front wall, the first of its kind to be found at Qay6nii. To the final building phase belongs a spacious house with large rooms; four piers stood in a row in the center of this structure. Reports appeared in Symposium 10:1 (1988) 37-56; Anatolica 15 (1988) 139-59; Bathron. Fest- schrift Drerup (Saarbrticken 1988) 367-73. The (ay6nti team also surveyed the Diyarbaklr region to investigate Neolithic settlement and material resources. Six aceramic sites were found within a 20 km radius of (aydnti, some larger than (ay6nti itself. Aceramic Neolithic sites are also reported at Cinaz, ca. 60 km north of Qay6nl, by Hasan Bahar, Research Symposium 6 (1988) 501-502, 511-18. Nevalih ori. This site in the Kantara valley east of Lidar is the most prominent counterpart of aceramic Qayijni. The building with a floor of large polished slabs, excavated in 1987 (AJA 93 [1989] 107), had one rectangular limestone stela in situ in the center and fragments of another such stela. Prof. Harald Haupt- mann kindly provides illustrations of the originally 3 m high stela with its low relief design of a human figure with long arms and hands carved on the narrow edge (fig. 1) and of the fragmentary human torso of soft limestone, 37 cm high (fig. 2). House 7 of Level 3, with its cross-channels and rubble paving (fig. 3) is of a type comparable to the cell-plans at Qay6nti. For a discussion see H. Hauptmann, Anatolica 15 (1988) 99-110. Ceramic Neolithic: Ko6k Hiiyiik-Nigde. The ma- jor occupation of this site was in the ceramic Neolithic period. Dr. Ugur Silistreli reports that houses of the three Neolithic building levels were further investi- gated. Plans are rectangular as a rule, but two round structures were discovered in 1987. Inhumations of children (rarely adults) are found below house-floors; tomb gifts consist of feeding bottles, beads and amu- lets, as well as tools and weapons of obsidian, bone, and stone. Obsidian is widely used in the settlement. A seated female figurine was found in a tomb in 1988. It is of buff clay with red paint; the head is preserved with a cylindrical hat; the upper body is small, as usual, with arms crossed in front; the lower body is heavy. Nude female figures also appear in relief on vessels; the upper part of a female torso and arms are frontally represented on a red polished fragment. Paint sometimes appears on the relief ornaments; black ware may have white-filled incisions and poin- tillk patterns. Symposium 10:1 (1988) 61-66. Kurugay. Prof. Refik Duru conducted his final cam- paign in 1988. He excavated three Early Neolithic houses of Level 12 to the northeast of the Level 11 wall with towers. These houses measure ca. 8 x 6 m and have stone foundations. Dark-faced burnished pottery continued to appear in Level 13, which yielded no architectural remnants. Some of the pot- tery is painted and represents a precursor of Early Chalcolithic Hacilar wares. For the 1986-1987 cam- paigns see Belleten 52 (1988) 653-66 and Symposium 10:1 (1988) 57-60. Iliplnar. Dr. J.J. Roodenberg reports on the second season at the mound of Ilipinar on the west shore of the lake of Iznik: "The aim of these excavations is the analysis of Chalcolithic and Neolithic habitation in northwest Anatolia in interrelation with the Balkans and central Anatolia.</page><page sequence="4">128 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 94 Fig. 1. Nevalih ori. Limestone stela, Aceramic Neolithic period "The upper levels contain Byzantine as well as pre- historic burials. The latter are mostly in contracted position and provided with pottery, bronze tools, and weapons. A double burial had bronze flat axes, knives and an awl, and nine vessels (fig. 4). This material must antedate Troy I. Metal weapons of a later type have also been found at Ilipmar as remnants of EB burials. "Habitation is attested from Late Neolithic to Late Chalcolithic, ca. from the sixth to the early fourth millennium B.C. The upper level had houses oriented east-west with mudbrick walls, ca. 16 x 4.50 m; par- titions were of wattle-and-daub; hearths and storage areas are preserved. Timber architecture oriented north-south characterizes the earlier building phase. In the deepest level houses with rows of posts yield well-preserved specimens of calcified ash wood (frax- inus). Faunal analysis points to domesticated cattle, pig, sheep, and goat; deer are hunted in the local forests; the analysis of shells confirms the theory that the Sea of Marmara was increasingly salinized ca. 5000 B.C." Symposium 10:1 (1988) 67-69. BRONZE AGE SITES Kiiltepe. Prof. Tahsin Ozgfic reports that a new area of the Karum was investigated on the east side, starting with Levels IA and IB in grid L-M/8-9. Both levels are well preserved. Level IA in this district has sturdy houses similar to those of IB in plans, building technique, hearths and ovens, pottery, and inventory. Burials were put under the houses as in previous levels. So far the houses of Level IA have not yielded any tablets, but the general continuity indicates that this level will close the gap between IB and the Old Hittite Dynasty. Fig. 2. Nevah (ori.

House of Aceramic Level 3 The houses of Levels IB and IA open onto a street which began in Level II and had its surface raised twice, in IB and IA, without change in layout and direction. It had a flat stone paving and a stone-built drain which is part of the general drainage system of the Karum. The IB level is better preserved than IA as a result of conflagration. The kitchen and pantry inventories are complete with an ample collection of household vessels. Burials are under housefloors in the form of cist graves (these are the wealthiest), pithos graves, or plain inhumations. Some of the graves had been plundered in antiquity, and intact IB floors were found over them. The houses of IB had up to six or seven rooms, and contained a small num- ber of tablets, not large archives of the type found in Level II. Local trade continued among Anatolians after the destruction of II, and the local merchants were wealthy. In their tombs, bronze vessels, weapons, and gold and silver jewelry attest to prosperity. A new kind of cult-vessel from Level IB is a buff ware bowl with high relief decoration of two lions; the spout is in the shape of a bull's head; a man is next to it inside of the bowl. Level II in this area is an all-Assyrian quarter. The district is crowded with large houses and rich archives. The houses are of good Anatolian half-timber con- struction and burnt fiercely in the destruction. The inventory remained in situ. The archives are some- times in the basement, otherwise on the main floor. The tablets were kept in straw matting, on wooden shelves or (often) in jars. Some of the ca. 1000 tablets found in 1988 were in their envelopes and addressed but not sent to various Anatolian cities; other tablets represent unopened mail from ASlur. The envelopes have 2-6 cylinder seal impressions. Bullae were also found. A study by Nimet Ozgiiu of the bullae from Kiiltepe is in preparation. The tombs of Level II are very rich in metal: six bronze vessels came from one tomb; among the weap- ons are Syrian axes, spearheads, and daggers; among the jewelry is a gold pin with two bull's heads at the top. Cylinder seals are the only items of Assyrian manufacture in the tombs; the other objects are local or North Syrian. It has become clear that the Assyrian merchants in the Karum lived especially in the large area between D/6 and Z-aa-bb/26-29, where archives abound. Outside of this merchants' area, the houses have similar general inventories but no tablets; they Fig. 4. Ihplnar. Pottery from double burial</page><page sequence="6">130 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 94 may have been inhabited by local people in other occupations. Anatolian merchants were also estab- lished in the special commercial district. The concen- tration of the business community in the east side of the Karum has become clear in the recent excavations. Bogazk6y. Dr. Peter Neve reports that in 1988 he completed excavations of Temple 30 near the Lion Gate. "This building in design and construction re- sembles Temples 2, 3, and 4 and was also destroyed by fire at the end of upper city Period 4, but not rebuilt, unlike these temples. "The main objectives of the 1988 campaign were Nigantepe and the so-called South Citadel (see plan AJA 93 [1989] 108, fig. 1, nos. 24, 25). Both areas were reoccupied in the Phrygian period, especially in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. There were houses on Nigantepe. The South Citadel was fortified with a double wall which protected residential units. Hittite spolia were in evidence at both sites. "On the South Citadel, Hittite constructions emerged, one outside of the citadel, the second im- mediately below the Phrygian fortification. The rem- nants in situ and fallen blocks belonged to vaulted rooms with ashlar walls, 4 m long, 1.60-2.20 m wide and once 3.20 m high, with roof blocks cut on the underside into barrel-vault shape for the ceiling. The chamber within the citadel had a Hittite Hieroglyphic inscription of six lines. At the lower left corner was a relief of Shuppiluliuma wearing a divine horned hat, holding spear and bow; this relief was found reused in the Phrygian inner citadel wall face. The rear wall of the chamber has a relief of a king with lituus under the winged disc; he holds the life sign. "The inscription on the right side gives the name and title of the Great King Shuppiluliuma four times, presumably Shuppiluliuma II who is also referred to in the Nigantepe inscription. The chambers probably were tomb chambers, although Shuppiluliuma II may not have had a ceremonial burial at the time of the Hittite collapse." Extensive reports on the 1987 campaigns appeared in AA 1988, 357-90 and Symposium 10:1 (1988) 211- 59. H. Otten published the bronze tablet found in 1986 near the Sphinx Gate, Die Bronzetafel aus Bo- azkiiy. Ein Staatsvertrag Tuthaliyas IV (Wiesbaden 1988); see also his Die 1986 in Bogazkiiy gefundene Bronzetafel (Innsbruck 1989). A special study of the pottery production of the Late Empire is Andreas Mtiller-Karpe's Hethitische Tdpferei der Oberstadt von Hattuwa (Marburg-Lahn 1988). Hittite Texts. Hittite building rituals are discussed by Ahmet Unal in Belleten 52 (1988) 1469-1503 and JCS 40 (1988) 97-106. Ikiztepe. Prof. Onder Bilgi deepened an area of Ikiztepe Mound I to expose three more building levels of the EB III period. The wooden houses are pre- served in charred remains after conflagration; the clay plaster retains the impressions of timber and twigs. A hearth plate had thin holes along one edge as the remnants of a firescreen. Light and gray ware pottery, brush handles, whetstones, and some metal tools came from these levels. Explorations in the area continued with the special aim of studying the metallurgical resources and prac- tices. In 1988 the east part of the Bafra plain and the Merzifon area were searched. Samples of ore and slag were collected for analysis. A report appeared in Sym- posium 10:1 (1988) 201-209. The final publication has begun with a major vol- ume by U. Bahadir Alkim, Handan Alkim, and Onder Bilgi, Ikiztepe I. The First and Second Season's Exca- vations (Tuirk Tarih Kurumu Publications V:39, An- kara 1988). Inandiktepe. The excavations at Inandiktepe, 109 km north of Ankara along the road to Cankirl, have now been published by Tahsin Ozguf, Inandzktepe: An Important Cult Center in the Old Hittite Period (Tuirk Tarih Kurumu Publications V:43, Ankara 1988) with an introduction by Raci Temizer. The book offers rich material from the Old Hittite temple, which was destroyed and had no later Hittite overlay. In the comparative discussion of the cult vase with its reliefs illustrating ritual, Prof. Ozguii presents fragments of relief vessels from Eskiyapar, the site 20 km southeast of Alacah6ytik. The introduction to the volume by Temizer provides much detail on the excavations con- ducted by him during his term as Director of the Ankara Museum of Anatolian Civilizations (see under Yalburt-Ilgln, Konya). Acemh6yfik. Excavations were resumed in 1988. Prof. Nimet Ozgui? reports: "The burnt, half-tim- bered Sarikaya palace was in need of protective mea- sures to support walls and fill the beam holes. Timber reinforcements of thesholds and doorways were stud- ied in detail. In the room that served as a repository for bullae, 13 more specimens were found in the clearing of overhanging walls. The impressions in one instance just gave the seal inscription, other impres- sions showed scenes of worship of the bull altar. Also found was the 47th impression of a stamp seal (Ac. 88-10) with the design of a seated god holding staff and ring, confronted by another god; behind them are a fish and pitcher, respectively; above, two mon- keys; below, another fish (fig. 5). Heraldic designs are well represented. Of a stamp seal with heraldic eagles and monkeys, 134 impressions have now been found; of one with heraldic antelopes and bird, monkeys and two crescents, 160.</page><page sequence="7">1990] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 131 "To the south of the Sarikaya palace, Hellenistic and Roman constructions have damaged the palace and adjoining structures. Ancient spolia appear in the later levels. To the East and North, Hellenistic foun- dations descend to the level of the palace porticoes. Some of the Hellenistic walls were built as continua- tions of the palace walls. We removed the upper of two Hellenistic levels from the area of the north por- tico in VA-YA/42-43. The Hellenistic houses have several rooms; the inventory yielded bowls with plain interiors and red rings on the outside, triangular lamps, an eagle made of pumice, weights, and spindle whorls." Prof. Ozgfu adds that Dr. Onhan Tunca is publish- ing the inscriptions on cylinder seal impressions found at Acemh6yuk. Inscriptions of Shamshi-Adad I appear on impressions of at least two cylinder seals of the king himself, represented by eight and nine bullae respectively; see Nimet Ozgfiu in Edith Porada ed., Ancient Art in Seals (Princeton 1980) pl. III, la-c, for one of these. The chronology of the titles of Shamshi-Adad is analyzed. Other cylinder seal impressions give the name of Liter- arrussu, an of- ficial also known from Mari and Tell Leilan; the pres- ence of this bulla suggests that the palace of Acem- h6yiik was active at least as late as the conquest of Mari by Shamshi-Adad. The remarkable collection of stone (rock crystal, obsidian, and other) vessels from Acemh6yfik is dis- cussed by Aliye Ozten in Belleten 52 (1988) 393-406. Kaman-Kaleh6yiik. The Japanese excavations un- der Prof. T. Mikami are still largely in the stage of exploring the Phrygian levels overlying the Bronze Age habitation. There are several Phrygian building levels with characteristic inventory such as pottery, fib- ulae, arrowheads, a bronze plaque, a fibula mold (!), and crucibles. Strays from earlier levels are Hittite Hieroglyphic bullae and a sherd of an Old Hittite relief vase. For the 1987 season see Symposium 10:1 (1988) 353-68. Karah6yuk-Konya. Prof. Sedat Alp reports further work in the east area of the mound, where more houses were cleared in 1988. House walls and floors are preserved with outer and inner doorways, store- rooms, hearths, and much of the inventory preserved after the conflagration: pottery, a large bronze caul- dron with two loop handles on the rim, a smaller cauldron, beads, and seal impressions, including a stamp impression on a vessel. Ilgln-Yalburt. The excavation of the Hittite spring- basin of Tuthaliya IV at Yalburt, northeast of Ilgm and ca. 60 km northwest of Konya, is described and illustrated by Raci Temizer in the introduction to Tahsin Ozgii, Inandzktepe (Ankara 1988) pp. xxv- P0 Fig. 5. Acemh6yiik. Stamp seal impression on bulla xxvii, pls. 85-95. Arslantepe-Malatya. Prof. Alba Palmieri and Dr. Marcella Frangipane worked on the transition from EB III to MB I in the newly opened area of the upper slope. The development is uninterrupted but un- evenly preserved. For EB III, three ceramic phases were distinguished. The EB III buildings are large and terraced on the slope. The walls have heavy stone socles. In the EB IA level of the Late Uruk period the excavation of the storage complex was completed with the clearance of the south room, which had a window in the east wall. A large amount of pottery was recov- ered, including 15 large handleless jars, wheelmade bottles and bowls, as well as clay sealings with stamp and cylinder seal impressions. The system of distri- bution and storage is remarkably well organized. The transition to EB IB with Transcaucasian traits again reveals the other side of Malatya's cultural con- tacts and population: circular structures, semi-sub- terranean, wattle-and-daub huts, black burnished handmade pottery. A splendid report on the 1975-1983 campaigns was published by A. Palmieri, M. Frangipane et al., "Perspectives on Protourbanization in Eastern Ana- tolia: Arslantepe (Malatya)," in Origini 12:2 (1983, published 1988) 287-668. Oylum Huyufk. This large mound south-southwest of Gaziantep, 6 km from Kilis, is being investigated by Dr. Engin Ozgen. Villagers had taken earth from the mound and had exposed a built tomb of EB date that yielded ample pottery and some metal objects. The mound has a major EB occupation. Symposium 10:1 (1988) 95-102.

Prof. Hayat Erkanal expanded the range of exploration beyond the neo-Assyrian period which had previously yielded evidence for large buildings of the eighth and seventh centuries B.C. In 1987, the middle Assyrian level began to emerge; a tablet of Tiglathpileser I confirmed the date. In 1988, a group of 34 EB tombs was excavated on the north terrace. Most of these were inhumations, two in pithoi and one in a mudbrick cist. The burials are contracted with heads to the west; the floor of the tomb is covered Fig. 8. Gordion. Part of Hittite horse-shaped vessel by straw matting. Pottery was ample: metallic ware and painted jars with red designs. Among the other tomb gifts are lapis amulets and beads, a bone figurine of a woman, bone cylinder seals (hero with animals), a rock crystal seal, and much metal; among the weap- ons are shaft-hole axes with imprints of textiles. The stylistic traits of the jewelry and seals point to the Early Dynastic II period. Reports for 1987 appeared in Symposium 10:1 (1988) 272-86; MDOG 120 (1988) 139-52. Harran.

Western Anatolia: Gordion. The new excavations directed by Prof. G.K. Sams and Dr. Mary M. Voigt reached Hittite levels in soundings below the Phrygian court between Megara 2 and 10 (figs. 6 and 7). Dr. Voigt reports: "Sealed beneath a distinctive Phrygian white chip layer were Late Bronze Age deposits, rep- resenting a succession of outside work areas that con- tained pits, ovens, hearths, and what seemed to be courtyard walls. The pottery is buff wheelmade. At the base of the sounding a semisubterranean room with stone foundations was cleared; above its floor was much pottery including half of a vessel shaped like a horse (fig. 8). Five complete vessels came from a small pit dug into this deposit. A large bowl rim had a seal impression with Hittite Hieroglyphs (fig. 9)."

Dr. Turan Efe re- ports that his 1988 survey work yielded evidence for three Lower Palaeolithic sites in the Taveanll area, and for Late Chalcolithic and EB sites with metal working in EB I in the same district. Neolithic and Chalcolithic habitation was noted at a forestry station southwest of Eskigehir. For the early second millen- nium B.C., important stations are at Tavganll hiyik and Oluklu hiyik near Demircihiyok. Marmara survey.

Level 9, Middle Bronze Age house complex Troad and Balikesir for prehistoric habitation. A site in the Qan area gave promising evidence for Aceramic Neolithic settlement; an EB site in this region (Ho- yticek) had material from the later phases of EB. Troy. Prof. M. Korfmann reports that in the first season of the new consolidation and excavation pro- gram three areas were investigated. The deep Schliemann trench was cleaned and the walls of Level I, with remnants of floors and pits, were restudied. Schliemann's series of east-west walls be- longs to rectangular structures with doorways pre- sumably on the west side. These units have party walls; the connection with Megaron 102 excavated by the Cincinnati expedition will be examined in 1989. Anal- ysis of the fortification wall at the south end of the trench allows a differentiation in several phases an- tedating the buttressed south gate cleared by Blegen. The pinnacle over the southeast wall of Megaron IIA is being taken down with a concentration on stratigraphic detail and sampling of all organic evi- dence. The strata of Troy V and IV were removed in 1988. In the lower city, soundings were made to study the Roman and Hellenistic habitation as well as the extent of occupation in the Troy VII and VI periods. Sound- ings in grid squares I-K/16-18 and K/13 yielded evi- dence for major Roman streets running roughly north-south and east-west, as predicted by magnet- ometer prospection. Below a Hellenistic building level, further probes yielded evidence for second- millennium habitation with samples of Gray Minyan ware and Mycenaean IIIB 1 skyphoi of good quality. A team from the University of Cincinnati under Prof. Stella G. Miller is part of the new excavation staff and is beginning work on the Classical monu- ments of Troy and the recording of Theaters A, B, and C. Prof. Ilhan Kayan is continuing his geomorphol- ogical investigations of the ancient coastlines and river valleys; see Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Pa- laeoecology 68 (1988) 205-18.

Samsat. Plans for one further season at Samsat have been developed, Prof. Nimet Ozguig reports. The modern village at the site is now abandoned, but the archaeological part of the mound is above water level. The Hellenistic palace is to be further investigated, as are the city walls and topography of the lower city. The prehistoric levels are to be excavated down to virgin soil. Lidar. The field work at this site came to an end in 1987. Prof. H. Hauptmann kindly provided the fol- lowing details on the MB habitation Levels 8-10. Level 8, destroyed probably by Hattushili's campaign in the 17th century B.C., has houses consisting of a large hall (6 x 11 m) flanked by two smaller rooms, a type also known at Ebla IIIB. Level 9 has similar houses, and larger complexes in the south part of the mound (fig. 10). Burials are intramural, as in Level 8, with pottery, bronze pins, beads, and a cylinder seal (fig. 11). The fortification of Level 10 with its 3 m-thick buttressed mudbrick wall is illustrated in fig. 12, with part of the habitation complexes behind.

The Alipar connection was also postulated by Ufuk Esin. Tille. In 1988, Dr. David French reports, the pre- Assyrian Kummuh level was studied in its many re- buildings and renewals. In the southwest corner the upper part of a burnt mudbrick structure of the Late Bronze Age is emerging. Imamoglu. During a study season in 1988, re- searchers analyzed the stratigraphy of four MB levels, the last one contemporary with Karum Ib, Dr. Edibe Uzunoglu reports. The major building levels were those of EB III. The upper EB IIIC level had evi- dence of round or ellipsoid houses on the south slope; the main EB IIIB level is that of the large building of nine rooms on terraces from north to south. Below this lies a predecessor of EB II-IIIA. For the final campaign see Symposium 10:1 (1988) 71-93. Sempiyetepe. Prof. Muhibbe Darga directed rescue work on a cist-grave cemetery near Suyatagi K6yu in 1988. These graves came to light along the edge of the artificial lake; they were cut into the slope on the river side. The tombs are rectangular, built of slabs on all sides; limestone slabs also form the covers; they contain burials provided with handmade pottery of gray and reddish-black ware, probably of EB I type: collared jars, flaring bowls, footed bowls, large buff jars, and a lugged jar. For discussions of the site see Symposium 10:1 (1988) 181-99, and Documentum Asiae Minoris Antiquae, Festschrift Heinrich Otten (Wiesba- den 1988) 77-85. Euphrates/Tigris Area Survey. An effort has started to record sites and plan selective excavations in the areas of the two new dams to be constructed in the Euphrates (above the town of Birecik and just north of Carchemish) and two in the Tigris (near the village of Ilisu, 60 km upstream from Cizre; and above Cizre). Dr. Guillermo Algaze reports on his 1988 sur- vey: "The combined reservoirs will submerge a substan- tial area of about 400 km2 along the two rivers and their tributaries. The eastern bank of the Batman river (a Tigris tributary north of Batman, east of Diyarbaklr) was explored in 1988. Well over 75 sites and a small number of standing ruins were recorded, ranging from Upper Palaeolithic flint scatters to oc- cupations of Seljuk and Ottoman date. Fairly com- plete sequences are attested for the Late Chalcolithic period, one of the most important in the Batman area, and for MB and following periods. Much to our sur- prise, no Neolithic materials were identified in the survey, and EB was equally absent. "The Botan river area near Siirt will be most af- fected by the rising waters. Southeast of Siirt the river widens; here 17 sites were discovered, including a small Chalcolithic site, two small settlements with painted pottery of possible Iron Age date, the remains of two Seljuk bridges and a small Ottoman han. Note- worthy is Tfirbe Tepe, on the east bank of the river some 6 km north of its confluence with the Tigris. A 60 m-long and 3 m-thick wall of large unworked field boulders laid dry is apparently the facade of a massive building partially eroded by the river. The pottery in the slope directly under the wall was of Ubaid type, as was pottery in patches against the wall's inner face. Inland to the east was a large scatter of obsidian tools and debitage over an area of at least 200 x 300 m, without pottery. Cattepe, a triangular mound on the west bank of the Botan river where it joins the Tigris, has Late Chalcolithic remains at its base. A late Roman equites fort, part of the Tigris limes, was built over the earlier mound, with long stretches of walling and towers. "Southeast of Cizre, the mounds start in the Halaf period and are prominent in the MB era (Khabur ware). About 13 km north of Cizre is a fortress city on both banks of the Tigris. Roman wares date public buildings eroding out of the mounds on the earth bank near the modern village of Fenik. A large square Late Roman castellum (ca. 275 m per side) stands on the west bank, with a double enclosure wall, rounded corner towers, and a moat. This may be the Roman fortress city of Bezabde-Phoenicha (= Fenik) captured by Sassanian armies of Shapur II in A.D. 360. Par- thian activities are also attested. "Euphrates: the partially bulldozed site of Sadi Tepe, on a low natural ridge west of the Euphrates some 8 km north of Carchemish, has ample evidence for occupation in the Late Uruk period: typical pot- tery, hundreds of beveled rim bowls, and bitumen- covered terracotta wall cones. Its relationship to other Uruk colonies along the Euphrates, and its role vis-at- vis Carchemish deserve investigation." METALLURGY Taurus Mountains. Dr. Aslihan Yener continued her research on potential sources of ancient tin in the Taurus mountains. She reports on her work in the Nigde-Camardl area in Science 244 (1989) 200-203. The Kestel mine, 1,800 m above sea level, has rem- nants of cassiterite; C-14 dates point to EB use of the narrow mine-shafts. A report appeared in Archaeo- metry Symposium 4 (1988) 1-28.

AJA 93 (1989) 1-29 has the report of the 1986 campaign with discussions of the cylinder seals and the Nefertiti scarab. During the 1988 campaign, Cemal Pulak reports, the raising of the cargo continued in several parts of the wreck, leaving keel and hull planking in situ for later explo- ration. Artifacts of varied nature and origin continue to appear, including stone anchors (the total now stands at 20), two complete ox-hide tin ingots and a new shape of copper ingot, a large gold Syrian med- allion with sun design, two scarabs, assorted balance- pan weights, much pottery of Cypriot fabric, and an encrusted krater of ca. 0.48 m diameter. Supplementary investigation of the Bronze Age wreck at Cape Gelidonya yielded two large LH IIIB stirrup jars swept to the southeast by the current; a sword and tools were found in a crevice of a large boulder on which the ship had partly landed; see INA Newsletter 15:4 (1988) 12-17 and Symposium 10:1 (1988) 307-21. Panaztepe. Dr. Armagan Erkanal reports that fur- ther excavation in the north part of the citadel con- firmed occupation dating to the early second millennium B.C. Pottery of MB shapes is represented in jars, jugs, and a footed ribbed vessel in buff ware. The acropolis and its fortification wall were reused in the Classical era. A rectangular building in the south part may be a temple built in the sixth century B.C. Some units were used in the fourth century B.C. A report appeared in Symposium 10:2 (1988) 59-65. In BSA 83 (1988) 55-82 Yagar Ersoy publishes eight bronze weapons, six LH IIIA vessels, and seven local west Anatolian vases acquired by the Manisa Museum in 1982 after tomb robberies at Panaztepe. Notable are the large local vessels in the shape of a lentoid flask and two kraters (H. 0.395 m and 0.431 m). Gavurtepe-Alagehir (Philadelphia). Dr. Recep Meri? reports on his 1988 excavation on this Bronze Age mound: "Excavation is continuing in the area marked kazz alanz on the plan, fig. 13. The upper level was disturbed by pits. The next level is better preserved and has remains of stone walls, fallen mud- bricks, and burned floors. The pottery is of EB II- III type, but mixed with MB material. The megaron referred to in Symposium 8:2 (1986) 261-65, measur- ing ca. 30 x 12 m with walls ca. 2.60 m thick, is located on the summit of the mound. The walls are of Cyclo- pean masonry preserved to at least three courses (fig. 14). The topsoil here has sherds of MB-LB type, with an occasional Mycenaean fragment (Symposium 10:1 [1988] 165, fig. 7). Hellenistic sherds must come from tombs, since the mound became a burial ground after Philadelphia was founded by Attalos II. "Two orthostats were exposed, after a heavy rain- fall, in the scarp at the northern edge of the mound (fig. 15). Unfortunately they were soon removed by illicit diggers. The area calls for further investigation to determine the use and date of these slabs." For last year's report see Symposium 10:2 (1988) 157-70. Ephesus. Anton Bammer comments on the geo- morphology of the river valley and coast near Ephesus and the prehistoric sites in the vicinity, OJhBeibl 57 (1986-1987) 2-38, and gives considerable thought to questions concerning Ephesus in the Late Bronze Age in his new book Ephesos: Stadt an Fluss und Meer (Graz 1988). For details on Bronze Age sites in the Ephesus area, see also Dr. Recep Meri?'s report on his Ionian survey, Research Symposium 6 (1988) 385-92. He comments on Ilicatepe, Halkapinar, and G6ztepe. A Mycenaean kylix foot is reported for Nemrut huyfik near Kem- alpaga. Miletus. Karin B. G6decken gives the results of petrological and neutron activation analysis of LB pottery samples from Miletus and presents the con- clusion that most Mycenaean and Anatolian wares were manufactured at Miletus itself. She distinguishes two workshops, to one of which she assigns the kiln excavated in 1957 south of the Athena temple. Mile- sian exports are identified among the Mycenaean wares at Iasos, Masgebi, and Ugarit. The signs en- graved on some Milesian containers are taken as evi- dence of the local use of a linear script. There is no break in the workshop traditions at Miletus from LB to Iron Age and Archaic Greece (Problems in Greek Prehistory, ed. E.B. French and K.A.

Prof. Veli Sevin started excavations at UJ- tepe, 40 km southeast of Diyarbakir, a site where two neo-Assyrian stelae were found in 1865 (Assurnasir- pal II and Shalmaneser III, now in the British Mu- seum). The mound has a Roman and Late Hellenistic over- lay. A neo-Assyrian inhumation of a woman with a newborn child was equipped with gold jewelry, fai- ence beads, bronze bracelets and finger rings, as well as fine pottery. Assyrian Rock Monuments. Reports on the Assyr- ian Monuments Project of the British Institute in Ankara are given by H.F. Russell in AnatSt 37 (1987) and Research Symposium 6 (1988) 17-18. The rock reliefs of Karabor near Antakya have been recorded recently, as well as the relief at Uzunoglantepe north- east of Kozan. NEO-HITTITE AND PHRYGIAN SITES Ivriz. The new sculptural fragments of a statue and a stela are on display in the museum at Eregli. The relief represents the lower half of the god Tarhuns with stalks and vine; the statue fragment (part of neck, face, and hair with diadem) belongs to a figure at least twice life size. The inscriptions on the relief are the first bilinguals from the Warpalawas dynasty, in spite of the wishful wording of last year's entry (AJA 93 [1989] 119). The Phrygian black stone of Tyana and its counterpart found in 1982 are monolingual, as preserved. Karatepe. Prof. Halet Cambel reports that the statue of a god in the structure to the left of the upper (southwest) gate has been restored and set up on its original base. The base has a male figure between two bulls; the body and costume of the statue were put together out of original fragments; the head had to be completed by the restoration of a generic face; the upper part of the head and its horns are preserved in stone. The restoration and repair of the orthostats was brought near the final stage in 1988-1989. For in- terim reports on Karatepe and Domuztepe see Sym- posium 10:1 (1988) 331-52. Lidar-Carchemish-Malatya. J.D. Hawkins in AnatSt 38 (1988) 99-108 corrects the reading of the hieroglyphic titles of Kuzi-Te-ub on the two bullae found at Lidar in 1985. Kuzi-Te'ub is the son of Talmi-Telub, king of Carchemish, and this extends the Carchemish dynasty by one generation, since Kuzi-Telub also has the title of "king of the land of KarkamiS." In turn, he is the grandfather of two kings of Malatya-Melid, Arnuwantis and Runtiyas, which leads to continuity and a revision of chronology in the dynasties of the descendants of Shuppiluliuma I. Porsuk. Prof. O. Pelon reports on the 1987 exca- vation in Symposium 10:1 (1988) 103-34 and gives details on the construction of the burnt Hittite postern gate with its roof beams and door. Samples of its timber are being examined by dendrochronologist Peter Kuniholm. He reports that the 321-year Porsuk sequence overlaps the MB chronology from Kuiltepe and Acemhoyuik. This timber postern at the west side of the mound at Porsuk belongs to a Hittite level antedating the final Hittite constructions, which are also burnt. At the southeast side an early Hittite burnt building yielded a bulla with a stamp seal impression</page><page sequence="16">140 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 94 of the type with braided circular frame. Gordion. The results of the new Hittite soundings are referred to above in the Bronze Age section. The Dark Age situation, Dr. M. Voigt explains, remains open. Stratigraphically there was a complete break in the trial trenches between the Phrygian and Hittite levels, marked by a distinctive white construction and leveling layer made by Phrygian builders. "A few sherds of dark burnished handmade pottery were found in the uppermost Bronze Age levels, usually in pits. This ware has nothing in common with the buff (Hittite) pottery found in the same contexts." If we can thus separate the "barbaric" ware from Phrygian wheelmade ware, the European handmade pottery turns out to have come in well before the major Phrygian building program started at Gordion. The new upper trenches (see plan in fig. 7), laid out above the anterooms of the Phrygian terrace buildings 2 and 3, yielded fragmentary Islamic, Late Byzantine, and Roman remains above a well-pre- served Hellenistic building level with domestic inven- tory. Animal bones and vegetal remains were collected for analysis. Dr. William Sumner continued his regional survey and has now recorded 38 sites including settlements from EB to Phrygian and Classical. The study of the furniture from tumuli MM, P, and W by Dr. Elizabeth Simpson, in collaboration with restorers and specialists, continues. Prof. Burhan Ay- tug has identified the wood species of the tables and stool from Tumulus P as buxus sempervirens, taxus baccata, and juniperus foetidissima. He reports in Ar- chaeometry Symposium 4 (1988) 49-59. For conserva- tion work in the Midas tumulus and the citadel, see Keith DeVries in Symposium 10:1 (1988) 175-80. Ankara. Prof. Sevim Bulu? continues her investi- gation of the Begtepeler tumulus. The main burial was in a wooden chamber excavated by Makridi, but outside of the chamber is a large deposit of partly burnt offerings. Skeletons of bovines belong to sacri- ficed animals; cutting marks on the bones attest to a feast preceding the burning of the skeletons, Dr. Ibra- him Tekkaya reports in Archaeometry Symposium 4 (1988) 8 1-87. Among the burnt material are many decorative bronze plaques (fig. 16) with perforations for attach- ment along the edges; they are square, oblong, or lunate in shape and have panelled relief designs. Fi- bulae are also represented (fig. 17). The building of the tumulus with loads of soil is remarkably clear in the section (fig. 18). The study of this deposit will encourage further exploration of deposits outside of wooden chambers in less extensively excavated tumuli. Elmall Plain: Bayindir-G6kpinar. Director Kayhan D6rtluk of the Antalya Museum continued excavation of tumuli in the necropolis near these two villages. He reports on the 1986-1987 excavations in Symposium 10:1 (1988) 171-74, with a description of the crema- tion in Tumulus C and the Phrygian burial chamber in Tumulus D. The person buried in D, a woman (as established by Prof. Berna Alpagut), lay on a wooden bed in the north part of the timber grave. She wore a silver belt. Ten bronze fibulae lay on her chest, nine silver ones near her head. Two small cauldrons stood near the foot end of the bed, and many silver deco- rative plaques lay in this area, as well as two horsebits. A second splendidly preserved silver belt lay farther to the east. A bronze cauldron stood near the west wall, with two small silver cauldrons (one with a Phry- gian graffito on the shoulder), two ladles, five silver and many bronze omphalos bowls, and nearby, three ivory figurines and one of silver. The wooden chamber measured 3.25 x 4.50 m and had a pebble floor. Eight postholes remain along the walls, the wood of which had almost totally decayed. In 1988, excavations of tumuli with cremations con- tinued. Conservation of materials from the 1986 and 1987 burials is in progress. The graffiti on the silver vessels of Tumulus D will be published by Dr. Ender Varinlioglu. General. A special issue of Source 7:3-4 (1988) is devoted to Phrygian art and archaeology, with an introduction by O.W. Muscarella. The papers review the main problems, centering on Gordion and An- kara, as a good starting point for the new excavations at Gordion and expansion of Phrygian horizons to the south plateau from Elmali to Nigde and Porsuk.

Lubotsky in Kadmos 27 (1988) 9-26 gives a linguistic study and interpretation of the Areyastis inscription. In the same journal, 131-38, L.S. Bayun and V.E. Orel suggest that the inscription from Hui- yiicek (Friedrich XI) south of Taveanh is Phrygian rather than Mysian. Phrygian metallurgy. O.W. Muscarella in J. Curtis ed., Bronzeworking Centres of Western Asia c. 1000- 539 B.C. (London 1988) 178-92 reviews the Phrygian contribution to Iron Age metalworking and raises questions of the Dark Age gap in this connection.

Mitchell and M. Waelkens in AnatSt 38 (1988) 53-64 with accompanying plans. In 1988, Waelkens continued at Sagalassos. "A potters' quarter was identified on a plateau east of the theater and on the slopes to the south of it, with remains of work- shops, ovens, molds, dumps of rejects ranging in date from Late Hellenistic to the early sixth century A.C." Special research is planned on this complex. Mitchell started the survey of another Pisidian city, Ariassos, in the mountains 50 km north of Antalya. LYCIA Xanthos-Letoon. In 1987-1988, Prof. C. Le Roy reports, the mosaics of the Early Christian church at Xanthos were consolidated. Walls of a Roman build- ing were discovered under the church. In the Letoon, the temple of Leto has been studied in detail. "A sounding at the northwest corner revealed a large east-west base of early Hellenistic date, cut by the temple foundations, which rest on bedrock. A low terrace had been made west of the foundations, and an ashlar retaining wall held a higher terrace to the north. An inscribed stela (REG 1988, 12-53) was</page><page sequence="18">142 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 94 found in front of this wall previously; another rather effaced stela lay near the northwest corner (fig. 19). To the south, the foundations of the temple and its entrance ramp went through an Archaic pavement near the sacred spring (fig. 20). The pavement was reused in the Hellenistic period, and later covered with a layer of lime. At the time of Trajan the level had been raised to the euthynteria of the temple."

Prof. Fahri Iplk in 1988 undertook a general survey and made soundings near the triple-arched gate building of Mettius Modestus. Limyra. Prof. J. Borchhardt reports that a start was made in 1988 on the systematic recording of the upper citadel. In necropolis V, ca. 45 km east of the theater, hitherto unknown tombs were excavated in a long trench (fig. 21). This area was extensively used as an ancient quarry. Excavations of the Ptolemaion in the lower city continue to yield fragments of the architectural and sculptural decoration, this time in- cluding parts of a colossal figure of a horseman. Lions stood at each of the four corners of the square po- dium; see Symposium 10:2 (1988) 111-85, figs. 28-31. The frieze of the tholos has representations of horses, chariots, and charioteers. The tholos had a profiled imbricated roof; parts of the finial have come to light, with a snake coiled around an acanthus. A Roman colonnaded street leads directly to the Ptolemaion from the southeast. For Necropolis II see OJhBeibl 57 (1986-1987) 74-154. Arycanda. Prof. Cevdet Bayburtluoglu annually improves the appearance of this terraced Lycian city with its long history into Byzantine times. In the east necropolis, mausolea are excavated and repaired. A sarcophagus of Zosimos of Arycanda was found bro- ken and lidless. In the fifth- to sixth-century church, floor mosaics came to light; the walls are painted in simple polychrome patterns.

Prof. Fede Berti is continuing her work in the area of the Byzantine basilica in the agora (Sym- posium 10:2 [1988] 1-10). The south part of the cem- etery has been excavated, with about 300 tombs, the latest of which date to the 14th or 15th century of our era. The Roman buildings in this area were razed by Byzantine builders. The sanctuary that yielded the deposit of lead double axes antedates the fourth cen- tury B.C. It has a strong south wall and a pavement along the east side. Much remains to be excavated here. There is no geometric level below the south zone; late Roman is represented with several walls. At the west side of the agora, a deposit of late sixth- century B.C. pottery emerged in an area disturbed by a water conduit. R. Gusmani in Kadmos 27 (1988) 139-49 analyzes a Carian inscription on the rim of a black-figured Attic column-krater from the sanctuary of Zeus, pub- lished in BdA Suppl. 30-31 (1987) pl. XI.

"In the Agora Gate complex closing the east end of the Portico of Tiberius, a semicircular construction was discovered in the front center; the opposite west end had a parallel that turned out to form a long pool or basin ca. 140 x 40 m, 0.80 m deep. Its outer rim was carved like theater seats echoing similar carving of the stylobate blocks of the north and west colon- nades of the portico, suggesting seating for spectators. The portico, then, would be more like a gymnasium, a palaestra, or a xystos. Fragments of sculpture were found in the pool. "A chance find in the southwest necropolis was the front panel of a sarcophagus in superb condition with four Eros figures symbolizing the four seasons." New publications are: C. Roueche and J.M.

Tuchelt reports, the history of the Archaic temenos discovered along the sacred road was studied. The roofing system of the building on the terrace was analyzed in detail. Casts of four sphinxes have been installed along the edge of the terrace, Symposium 10:2 (1988) 29-36. Tuchelt writes about the Persian destruction of Didyma in AA 1988,427-38. Akbiik-Miletus. Dr. W.

Vetters published a report on the work in 1986-Spring 1987, AnzWien 125 (1989) 85-126, with a plan of the excavation area west of the Artemisium. Along the north side of the Croesus temple, ivories, gold coins, and jewelry came to light in a burnt stratum under the foundations; these are selectively illustrated. In 1988, Prof. G. Langmann reports, a pre-Archaic shrine foundation came to light below the central (Hogarth's) base in a context with pottery and votive objects of metal and amber. In the lower agora, soundings in the east yielded Late Ar- chaic tumulus tombs. In the west part, the building levels go down from pre-Hellenistic to the Geometric period. Here a Late Geometric oval house appeared, similar to the well-known house of this type at Bay- rakli-Old Smyrna. A well next to the oval house was sealed in the Late Archaic period. It will be excavated in the next season. In the harbor, where a pool of 7- 8 m depth remains, divers inspected the structural remains near the mole. Roman Imperial pottery, es- pecially amphorae, was plentiful. In Hanghaus 2/31, three charred beams with carved decoration were removed for conservation (AnzWien 125 [1989] 99-103).

The site was cleaned and two soundings were made, the first near the Apollo altar. The earliest strata above virgin soil belong to the late seventh century B.C. Remains of sacrifices, votive terracottas, ivory, and pottery range from early sixth to mid-fifth century. The pres- ent altar of Apollo was built on these layers in the first half of the third century B.C. The second sounding was between the north krepis of the Apollo temple and the south krepis of the Artemis temple. Here again the earliest layers were late seventh-early sixth century B.C.; a hoard of 164 bronze coins dates to the fourth century B.C.

In 1988, Dr. Omer Ozyigit undertook soundings in the Axos valley north of Erythrai where debris from pottery production abounds. This is of the Roman period, but evidence for Classical work- shops comes from lower levels. The material runs from Archaic to Byzantine.

Greenewalt, jr. reports: "The colossal Lydian fortification in sector MMS had been augmented in the first half of the sixth century B.C. by a massive earthwork on the west, ca. 15 m wide and preserved to a height of 12 m, which may have been designed to protect the main wall from mining and sapping operations. It is built of sloping layers of earth, sand, and gravel (fig. 22). The earth- work is interrupted by a recess 8-12 m wide, flanked by retaining walls. After the destruction of the mid- sixth century, the recess was filled with a tumble of fallen brick. The skeleton of an adult male was found</page><page sequence="22">146 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 94 Fig. 24. Pergamon. Court and rooms south of peristyle house, from west in the brick debris, which also yielded the iron helmet in 1987. The skeleton must belong to a casualty of the siege and partial sack of Sardis by the Persians between 547 and 542 B.C. "In the Late Roman residential complex in sector MMS, seven more spaces were excavated. A lead seal with crosses and the text "of Kosmas the diakonos" was found in one space; crosses that decorate a water tank and a wall surface in two other rooms would support the possibility that one of the units in the complex had been the residence of a deacon. "On the Acropolis spur (ByzFort) a semicircular slope interrupting the steep sides of the spur was investigated to determine if it was man-made, perhaps a staircase or a ramp. "Tomb of Alyattes: a charcoal sample from the layer of oak charcoal between the top of the chamber and tumulus earth provided a C-14 date of 640 B.C. ? 60 years." The opaque glass cullet from the Lydian house east of the fortification wall is discussed by R.H. Brill and N.D. Cahill inJGS 30 (1988) 16-27. R. Gusmani discusses Lydian masons' marks in Kadmos 27 (1988) 27-34. For the 1987 campaign see Symposium 10:2 (1988) 11-27. Lydian coinage. Robert W. Wallace wrote about the origin of electrum coinage in AJA 91 (1987) 385-97. In JHS 108 (1988) 203-207 he connects the early Lydian coin legend WALWE with Luwian walwi = lion. AEOLIS-MYSIA Pergamon. Dr. Wolfgang Radt reports that in 1988 the main excavation continued in the 20 x 35 m area between the Hera sanctuary and the large street to the north: "The Byzantine houses are of three phases in the 12th to 14th centuries. The underlying building level is predominantly Roman, below which are remains of Hellenistic houses of similar orientation (fig. 23). These are of the third and second centuries B.C. Three cisterns await excavation; the cistern under the court of a Hellenistic house (level 215.71 above sea level) was reused in Roman times. The terraced fill with andesite chips under the Hellenistic court con- tains many earlier, including Archaic, sherds. Below this fill lay a remnant of an earlier stone paving (level 214.55). "The Roman house had its court of ca. 10 x 12 m at level 216.27 with a peristyle of 6 x 4 or 5 columns. Porticoes with rooms behind are attested for three sides; at the south side the house may have been expanded with a portico over lower rooms built here</page><page sequence="23">1990] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 147 2 3 .4 .5 6 7 7 208,95~7 20657 6.57 90 ., 8,5 2"o90&amp;6.7- _O 80__ I _ _ __7_ 90 211.29... . ... .. - _ , . o ____ SOUDLICHER BEREICH .I..

To its east may have been a staircase to the upper floor. The main street ran at the level of the upper floor, rising to the west. The entrance of the house must have been from the east alley. There are several built drains, one parallel with the peristyle; the main drain runs from the west below the court to the east alley drain.</page><page sequence="24">148 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 94 Fig. 27. Pergamon. Restoration of peristyle house "South of the Hellenistic terrace wall lay another Roman court of ca. 8 x 8 m, with rooms to the north and west (fig. 24). Here again a Hellenistic terrace wall came to light, with a floor at 211.93, ceramically datable to ca. 150 B.C.; a Hellenistic court and cistern preceded the Roman structures, which may have been annexes of the house to the north or that to the east. "At the south, the Archaic fortification wall, pre- Hellenistic I, in fig. 25, was excavated for an additional 20 m to the west, again built of large unworked stones. Among the pottery nearby was much Aeolic gray ware, although precisely datable material was lacking. To the Classical fifth-fourth century phase of the walls (pre-Hellenistic II in fig. 25) we now attribute the so-called Hepding wall (YC in fig. 26), which runs nearly parallel to the gate walls cleared in 1987, under the Hellenistic I wall in fig. 25, level 204.83.

The Philetairan wall awaits investi- gation of the 40 m-stretch between a fragment at the west, level 210.57, and the stretch shown in fig. 26, YA. "Soundings to trace the Hellenistic street system are continuing with good results. The rock cuttings of drains can be traced and cover slabs are occasionally found in situ. "Consolidation and preservation were undertaken in the excavation areas. The Roman peristyle house was given a modern retaining wall and terrace; three column drums were placed on the north stylobate (fig. 27). Parts of the entablature and pediment of the Hera temple were put back on the stepped terrace as installed by D6rpfeld in 1911 (fig. 28). "Traianeum: the northwest corner of the temple was partly restored with the aid of newly worked column drums, stylobate blocks, and reinforcements of refined steel. Three columns were erected and the fluting nearly completed (fig. 29)." For reports on 1987 see AA 1988, 461-85; Sympos- ium 10:2 (1988) 67-81; AnatSt 38 (1988) 202-205.

Prof. Cogkun Ozguinel exposed more of the tufa foundations under the front of the temple. Of the superstructure, ceiling coffers decorated with a simple star-rosette came to light, and another frieze- block fragment with the representation of two gallop- ing horses with a chariot, a person in front of the chariot covering something with a cloth: perhaps Achilles covering Patroklos with a shroud and going into battle.

PROPONTIS, THRACE, BITHYNIA Prokonnesos: Saraylar. Dr. Nuyin Asgari recorded ancient quarries at Harmanta?. A column drum of 4.45 m diameter was left unfinished; it had probably</page><page sequence="26">150 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 94 been destined for the column of Theodosius in Con- stantinople. Inscriptions in the quarry point to activ- ities in this general period. A half-finished column capital from Saraylar is of Composite type; a basket- shaped Byzantine capital also was found half-finished, ready for shipment. Loading ramps have been iden- tified near the harbor, with a discarded broken col- umn drum by the side; see Research Symposium 6 (1988) 233-46. For the stages of workmanship of Corinthian capitals see N. Asgari in N. Herz and M. .VWaelkens eds., Classical Marble: Geochemistry, Tech- nology, Trade (London 1988) 115-25. Enez-Ainos. In 1988, Prof. Afif Erzen worked prin- cipally in the necropolis. Sarcophagi, tile graves, and bench-like structures were found; most are Hellenistic and Roman. The sarcophagi contained multiple strat- ified burials, Symposium 10:2 (1988) 89-107. Daskyleion. In 1988, Prof. Tomris Bakir reopened the excavations at Hisartepe-Daskyleion, where pre- vious excavations had been conducted by Prof. Ekrem Akurgal in 1955-1959. The satrapal site at the south shore of Manyas G6lii had been quarried and covered with vegetation in the interim of 30 years. The new excavations started in four trenches that were taken down through Byzantine, Roman, and Hellenistic lev- els. Many fragments of earlier pottery came out of the mixed fill: Attic black-glazed and red-figured ware, wild-goat style, and bird bowl fragments accom- panied by gray Aeolic ware. Fifth-century archi- tectural terracotta fragments and a piece of a Graeco-Roman sculptured slab also emerged. From a Byzantine pit came an Old Babylonian cylinder seal! The site has great potential. It is in a spectacular location overlooking the lake and its shores to the north where the Persian paradeisos has been turned into a modern bird sanctuary. Nearby are 11 tumuli, to the south and east, partly looted but in much need of archaeological attention. The collection of bullae found in the earlier exca- vations has now been studied by Dr. Deniz Kaptan of Ankara University. Kyzikos. Preparations are being made for excava- tions by Prof. Abdullah Yaylah who studied the site and the material brought into storage at Erdek. He plans to start excavation of the temple of Hadrian. PHRYGIA Aizanoi. Dr. Adolf Hoffmann in a final campaign investigated the state of completion of the north side of the stadium and the building operations that lasted into the third century A.C. Amorium. Prof. R.M. Harrison reports on the first season of excavation of this Roman and Byzantine town 70 km northeast of Afyon: "The main excavation was of a large Roman build- ing constructed with mortar and concrete in the southwest part of the site. It had three periods of construction: the upper one, later Byzantine, was much disturbed. This structure may have been a pal- ace or a major official building. Another trench re- vealed at 2 m depth an area that may be part of the main street. The city walls were investigated to deter- mine the various periods at the west side. Excavation exposed some earlier walls, a triangular tower, and a multi-period tower. "Among the finds are two Romano-Phrygian in- scribed stelae, a fragment of a Roman marble sculp- ture of Pan with a lion, and Late Roman pottery and glass, especially vessels and both straight and twisted bangles." For the initial survey see Research Symposium 6 (1988) 191-200 and AnatSt 38 (1988) 175-84. Hierapolis. Prof. Daria De Bernardi Ferrero re- ports that excavations continued at the west and east sides of the agora, with partial restoration. The north side of the agora has been traced with its marble colonnade. Much work is concentrated on the necropolis. The inscriptions in the north necropolis have been newly recorded. About 80 travertine sarcophagi of the first and second century A.C. have been studied in the small northeast necropolis. A plan has been made of the north necropolis. Important tombs are drawn separately with details of roof construction and ar- chitectural decoration. A photographic exhibition, Hierapolis 1957-1987, opened in Izmir in the Fall of 1987 and is now cir- culating in Turkey and Italy.

In 1988 impulse radar was added as an experimental aid to this project. Radar signals penetrate to 30 m depth. CILICIA Meydanclk-Giulnar. Dr. Alain Davesne reports that</page><page sequence="27">1990] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 151 additional investigations were made of the Byzantine walls east and west of Building A. The cavity in the rock south of Building A was cleared to 30 m depth without reaching the base. The main access area and road at the north side were excavated. The publica- tion of the gabled built tomb at the east side, with its two limestone statues in front, is being completed. A smaller tomb emerged to the north; Symposium 10:2 (1988) 301-303. Kelenderis. Dr. Levent Zoroglu in Symposium 10:1 (1988) 135-55 reports on his 1987 excavations in Kelenderis-Gilindere (Aydincik), the harbor city on the coast of Cilicia Tracheia south of Guilnar. In 1988 he continued work in the necropolis, which had suf- fered badly from illicit digging. Rockcut tombs date from the fifth century B.C.; built tombs are of the Roman period. A bath building near the harbor is being cleared, and soundings were made in the the- ater. For a fourth-century tomb group from Kelen- deris see JKF 10 (1986) 455-66. A gold coin hoard from Kelenderis of Ptolemaic date, partially recov- ered by the Silifke Museum, is reported by A. Davesne in Research Symposium 6 (1988) 407-409. Zoroglu has also made a survey of sites in the Giilnar area and has recorded a series of sites and their connecting road system with special evidence for the Hellenistic and Roman periods. For the Silifke area see Research Symposium 6 (1988) 393-406. Anamur. Prof. J. Russell reported on the 1987 campaign in Symposium 10:2 (1988) 261-70 and AnatSt 38 (1988) 191-93; also Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada 2 (1987) 145-62. ISTANBUL In the Sadberk Hanim Museum in Istanbul-Sariyer a second building has been opened, housing the ar- chaeological collection of Hiiseyin Kocaba?, who died in 1983. The modern exhibition starts with a group of Hacilar pottery acquired before Hacilar was exca- vated, including an authentic anthropomorphic ves- sel. In general, there are remarkable ceramic and metal artifacts in the collection, which was assembled with intelligent discrimination and a generous aware- ness of scholarly interests in the days before destruc- tive looting had started. The installation in the Sadberk Hanim Museum is designed in a sophisti- cated manner. An attractive catalogue, Sadberk Hanzm Museum (Istanbul 1989), illustrates and briefly de- scribes both the Kocaba? collection and the Islamic, Ottoman, and Ethnographical section.
