<plain_text><page sequence="1">Computation into Criticism: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels and an Experiment in Method. By J. F. Burrows. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987. Pp. xv+255. $48. J. F. Burrows studies mainly the thirty most common words in Jane Austen's fiction?articles, pronouns, auxiliary verb forms, prepositions, and the like, which make up about 40 percent of her texts. He bases his analysis on concor dances generated by computer for all novels by Austen plus concordances to Georgette Heyer's Frederica, Virginia Woolf's The Waves, James's The Awkward Age, Forster's Howards End, and the section of Sanditon completed by the hand of another lady. The concordances are produced primarily by the Oxford Concordance Package (OCP) and then subjected to analysis by minitab, ap parently with some local modifications or additional programming, to create chi-squared analysis of significant difference, normal distribution and linear regression tables, correlation matrices, eigen vectors, and so on. Throughout the study, Burrows treats words as individual items. He does not, for instance, consider prepositive or postpositive collocations, looking at how many times "to" is followed by an adjective or preceded by a certain verb, but he simply regards the frequency of occurrence of "to" in the text. Nor does he consider the position of the word in its string, asking questions such as how often a sentence ends with a preposition or how often does an adverb</page><page sequence="2">112 Bender come between the verb and its object. For most of his experiment, he divides Austen's novels into dialogue versus narrative purely on the basis of quotation marks. Dialogue is further divided according to speaker into the words ut tered in direct quotation by the forty-seven "major speakers" who have more than two thousand words each, plus Eleanor Tilney, who ranks forty-eighth with 1,938 words. Burrows maintains that each of these characters has a dis tinctive idiolect, perceptible in his or her use of the most common words, separating characters one from another and also from the authorial voice in the narrated sections of Austen's novels, as well as from the idiolects found in Woolf, James, Forster, Heyer, and so on. Assuming that the thirty most common words are stylistically "inert," they should be found in the same proportions throughout the dialogue of the forty-eight major speakers. Burrows finds this not to be the case. Each speaker differs from the others and from the authorial voice in the relative frequency of these common words. The reader's common intuition that character A sometimes sounds different from character B coincides with the apparent differentiation in occurrences of the most frequent words. Burrows con cludes, "The patterns displayed are too many, too various, and altogether too suggestive to countenance arguments favouring either the random or the es sentially inert distribution of common words" (p. 55). Burrows's analysis sometimes yields illuminating results, most often when he considers words as lexical items rather than merely as statistical data. For example, his treatment of "very" and "quite" demonstrates that the "pro nounced recourse to 'quite' is one of the marks of Jane Austen's vulgarians" (p. 64). Here the occurrence of "quite" must be tested against the historical degeneration of the word's meaning from "absolutely" toward a "mere ex pression of emphasis," for example in Miss Bates's "overworked token of good-hearted but ineffectual emphasis" (p. 65). The characteristic differentia tion in Austen captures a process of shifting meaning. Vulgarization of lan guage implies a similar social role. One of the common areas for the application of statistical analysis to high frequency words has in the past been the study of attribution. Impressive claims have been advanced by some scholars that high-frequency words form a pattern something like a fingerprint, so that a confession in a legal case can be disputed on the grounds that the transcript has a far greater frequency of prepositions than is credible from the short, extremely simple sentences typi cal of the accused speaker. Note that Burrows takes the opposite position. He does not argue that despite the superficial diversity among the characters in Jane Austen's fiction there is an ineradicable identity, evident in the statistics, marking all the words as the author's. If it is true that Jane Austen can "turn off" her personal style and impersonate the speech of a character so that even with the most minute function-words proportions change consistently from character to character, many of the claims of attribution via statistical analysis are discredited. Burrows seems to adopt incautiously an anthropomorphic assumption, that a character generates language from habits and a constant mental life that is on a par with the real author's. Can we compare the directly quoted speech of a character against the authorial voice outside the quotation marks? As Bur rows acknowledges from time to time, the text not enclosed in quotation marks may nevertheless be colored by indirect style and pick up the speech</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 113 patterns intended by the author to be reminiscent of character A or B. More over, the author can seldom be considered to be speaking in propria persona in any case, but must be imagined in a dramatized situation, an authorial persona addressing an imagined dramatic reader. And, of course, what about the generic restraints, found both inside and outside the quotation marks, of epistolary, hortatory, seductive, or other social or purely literary conventions? The division of Austen's novels into dialogue versus narrative is, at best, crude; but what alternative is there? As the author shades into free indirect discourse, how can the reader certainly find the exact word where the transi tion takes place from narrative voice to impersonated dialogue? The assump tion that such a transition from, say, Austen's words to Miss Bates's words must be sharp and clear-cut seems to be predicated on the doubtful notion that Miss Bates is as real as Austen. Most of the conclusions derived from Burrows's statistical study of the high frequency words reinforce self-evident intuitions of the common reader: the forty-eight major characters each speak with a somewhat different idiolect, some characters develop and that development is reflected in the way they talk, Austen's later novels have a somewhat different style from her earlier, her style is not to be confused with that of Woolf or James. The study of the high-frequency words does not claim to make discoveries startling in them selves, but to establish that at some level below the consciousness of reader and author, patterns of speech are called into play in order to establish the "self-evident intuition." What is being compared in Burrows's study is not so much dialogue versus narrative or Austen versus James, but the conscious versus the subconscious habits of speech or the overt versus the covert operations of decoding taking place as we read. Burrows is not entirely clear on the distinction between a code and its meaning. The marks on the printed page are a code in positional notation. The reader comes to that code equipped with decoding devices, such as grammar and lexicon, and constructs a meaning stimulated by the code. It would appear that the thrust of Burrows's argument is that there are features inherent in the code itself, before any lexical signification is assigned the words, which should guide the reader's constructive activity. Along these lines of argument, even if the reader does not know the English language at all, he would know that the speech of the forty-eight major characters should be differentiated because such differentiation is implied in the code itself in the differing relative frequencies of common words. It is not uncommon, in fact, for attribution studies to use methods like Burrows's on a language un known to the investigator to see if he can tell one letter-writer from another in, say, Norwegian, with no reference whatever to "meaning." But if the argument is that the code itself, the marks on the page prior to any constructive interpretation, reinforces the meaning subsequently con structed by the reader, Burrows must not blur the distinction between code and constructed interpretation. Considered as code, a word should be strictly defined as those symbols occurring between two spaces. In his list of high frequency words, Burrows's separation of "to (infinitive)" from "to (preposi tion)" moves his analysis from features of the code to an interpreted level. It is, at best, premature. The input data should probably be parsed and lem matized in its entirety and then subjected to such analysis. A parsed distinc tion should not be introduced arbitrarily in the data.</page><page sequence="4">114 Weinstein The analytical methods used in Burrows's study are elementary. While it would probably cause our colleagues in the sciences to smile to see a substan tial section of Burrows's text devoted to explaining what chi-squared and sig nificant difference mean, we must recognize that few of the university pro fessors for whom this book is intended are comfortable even on these lower slopes of numerical methodology. Considerably more powerful methods are available to apply to the kinds of problems Burrows attacks. The most impor tant implication of Burrows's study is not his statistical method, nor the rela tively obvious conclusions he reaches, but the fact that he is basing his work on a computer archive of literary texts. Probably within the coming decade scholars will begin to be able to buy the complete works of such authors as Austen, Conrad, or James as computer files, much as we now buy digital disc recordings of music. Routinely, classes will read standard authors on computer screens and any high school student will be able to generate a concordance to a novel by entering a few simple commands into his or her home computer. These developments will upset the economy of printing, destroy the economic basis for the canon of high litera ture, and create an expanded environment for "reading" in which patterns of imagery and characteristic turns of phrase can be isolated and examined so as to trace in the text the habitual decisions and mental inclinations of an author much more easily than is now possible. If traditional literary scholars do not try to understand and control this new technology, they run the risk that the library of the future will be controlled by technicians untrained in the aims and methods of traditional literary scholarship. All professional students of literature should read Burrows's book. Todd K. Bender University of Wisconsin-Madison</page></plain_text>
