<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-1995 INTRODUCTION This year's report should have been written by Martin Price, who became Director of the British School at Athens in October 1994. His sad and premature death, on April 28 1995, was preceded by a period of declining health, during which he was unable to start work on this report. It has been compiled, therefore, by me in some haste. I am deeply grateful to all those who have helped in what is essentially a joint effort: Colin Macdonald, who prepared the entries on the islands as well as the Crete entries, Jill Carington Smith, who prepared the other entries based on the Archaiologikon Deltion, which constitute the main part of this report, and David Turner, who prepared the Byzantine material. David Turner notes that only important newly-reported or excavated sites and finds have been highlighted. Of the extensive work done in cities and towns such as Thessalonike and Rhodes, only the briefest selection of sites has been made. Further information can be found in ADelt 43 (1988), which has been drawn on here. I have omitted page references to ADelt, whose entries follow the same sequence of districts as here in AR: individual sites are therefore easy to find. Similarly I have omitted the year reference: all entries taken from ADelt 43 refer to 1988, other entries to 1994-1995. References given simply by the date 1988 are taken from ADelt. Press. I have deliberately restricted the use of press reports, some of which have been found to be misleading in the past, and even totally erroneous, and have relied on them only for very recent discoveries of obvious significance, where the information they give is certain. It is very much regretted that such an erroneous report, in Eleutherotypia, was referred to in last year's entry about Glyka Nera, Attica. In general, items cited from the press are to be found in several newspapers, so I have not referred to named papers, but to 'press reports' in general. Much excitement was generated in the press by the announcement of the discovery at Siwa, the Oasis of Amun in Egypt, of what was said to be the tomb of Alexander the Great (rumours of this were already circulating in Alexandria in the winter of 1992). An inspection of the discoveries by a team of leading Greek archaeologists, headed by Dr Tzedakis, produced a sober, sensible and essentially negative response to the claim, though the matter is by no means closed. More important, though less sensational, was the accidental discovery, during fishing in relatively deep waters off Kalymn- os, of a bronze statue of a draped female; subsequent investiga- tions by underwater apparatus have led to reports of at least a second statue. Most significant, however, is what can only be described as a whole crop of Macedonian tombs, some unrobbed (one is described as a 'new Vergina'), some with splendid and well- preserved wall paintings, and with very varied exterior archi- tectural decoration, some of it distinctly uncanonical. So far, there are only press reports of them, but it is clear that taken together these give an exciting new dimension to our under- standing of early Hellenistic architecture. Museums and Collections. New Museums have opened in Lamia and at Mitylene. Building work on the massive exten- sion (12,600 m2) to the Byzantine Museum in Athens is well under way, due to be finished in 1998. The Museum will have state-of-the-art equipment, laboratories and conservation workshops, and will implement moder concepts concerning both display of objects and visitor participation. Some 10,000 objects are calculated to fill its extensive galleries. A Byzantine Museum is also being built in Verroia (a city especially important in the 14-15th Cts). An old water mill has been appropriated, with its surrounding area, and the building will have a total surface area of 2,450 m2, including conserva- tion workshops. The most important acquisition of the Numismatic Museum in Athens in 1988 was a group of 76 coins from the 19th Ct collection of Photiades Pacha. Ioannis Photiades served for many years as ambassador of the Porte in Athens and other European capitals. The coins were a bequest from his descend- ant Penelope Photiade. They cover a wide geographical area, from the Greek colonies in the West-Marseilles, southern Italy and Sicily-to Asia Minor. There are also Roman denarii of both the Republic and the Empire, a Byzantine dekanoummio of Phokas minted at Antioch in 604/605 AD, and a small number of later Greek and foreign coins. Funds from the Alexander Soutzos bequest enabled the museum to purchase parts of two hoards: 48 Boeotian HL bronze coins and 38 Byz coins of the 12th and 13th Cts, found in Macedonia; 139 individual coins were also purchased with funds from the same bequest. A generous sample of all these acquisitions is illus- trated in ADelt 43 Chr, pls. 5-8. A surface collection from the archaeological area of ancient Troezen consisting of two silver and 34 bronze coins representing the ancient Gr, R, Byz, Frankish and Ott periods, was presented to the museum (ADelt 43 Chr, 6-7).

The re-sited new office and workshop was completed, which allowed the demolition of the temporary one which had overlain the NE part of the LR cistern. This part of the cistern was thus freed for excavation. It contained a back-fill of small architectural fragments put there after the completion of Kabbadias' excavations last century, and clearing it and organizing all the fragments into different groups was a daunting task. Many small marble fragments (none with any dimension greater than .60m) were recognized as belonging to various architectural members of the Propylaia itself and are listed. A fragment of cornice from the Nike temple and small fragments from the Parthenon were also found and handed over to the teams studying those buildings. The structure of the cistern itself was tested and studied, and the various alterations and repairs it underwent are discussed. It had four successive floors, the lowest of water- proof plaster, the intermediate ones of terracotta tiles, and the uppermost visible was also of large clay roof-tiles of the Lakonian type. The deepest part of the cistern was in the NE and here, against the N wall, was a rectangular settling tank with a hole in its N edge to permit the silt to be drained off. In the N part of the cistern's was constructed. A Justinianic date for the cistern is preferred to the late 3rd Ct AD one previously given. Work continued on the study of Balanos' restorations to the central Propylaia, and ever-increasing cracking of the marble as a result of the rusting of the iron used in those restorations was observed. The protective wooden flooring in the central passage of the Propylaia was replaced. Agora. The ASCS under Professor T.L. Shear Jnr. con- tinued excavation in 1994. He reports: "The goals of the season were twofold: to examine and remove the Med remains overlying the C building behind the W end of the Stoa Poikile and to explore the deep levels along both banks of the Eridanos river in front of the Stoa Poikile and to the W. In the N area the rubble walls of several private houses were fully exposed and removed. They indicate a surprising density of occupation in the 10th and 11th Cts AD, after two centuries of virtual abandonment in the 8th and 9th Cts. The buildings cluster closely together, sharing party walls in a fully urban development. The houses removed show several phases of rebuilding in their two centuries of existence, with the walls constantly renewed-often on a slightly different line-as the ground level rose. Generally the evidence suggests a modest neighborhood, though the amount of storage capacity is impressive. In all, over a dozen pithoi or subterranean lined pits were explored, as many as four in use in a given building at any one time. They were constructed in a variety of methods, suggesting storage of varied commodities: large ceramic jars, mortared rubble, unmortared rubble, tile, and plastered mudbrick. The ground level rises gradually as one proceeds N from the Eridanos river and most of the evidence for later occupa- tion has been lost in the construction of moder building along Odos Astingos. The bottoms of a few pits which penetrated the lower Byz levels suggest at least some activity in the area in the 12th to 14th Cts. The EByz walls rested on a destruction fill of the late R period. Masses of tile, brick, and broken pottery were encoun- tered at various points in the N area, further testimony of the destruction of Athens by the Slavs, dated by similar deposits found elsewhere in the agora to the years around 582/3 AD. The tops of the walls of the late R phase are also just begin- ning to appear and will be explored in a future campaign. Closer to the river the area N of the altar of Aphrodite was investigated deep beneath the temple of ER date. Here a series of polygonal retaining walls steps down toward the river, with the terraces carrying the scanty remains of late A and EC houses. Passing through the area, running in a W direction, were four more sections of the handsome terracotta pipeline of the early 5th Ct which evidently brought water out to the Academy (Plutarch Kimon 13.8). N of the principal terrace wall we came upon a well, cut into bedrock, which went out</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 of use as a result of the Persian destruction of Athens in 480 BC. Lying just some 10m N of the late A altar and apparently in use at the same time, the well contained little material to suggest any connection between the two, only two or three battered terracotta figurines of a seated female deity. For the most part the well contained standard household debris: lekanides, bg drinking cups, small pitchers, an askos, and a few fragments of both bf and rf ware, along with numerous lamps and loom weights. Only 23m N of the Eridanos, this early well would seem to indicate that even in the A period the river did not play a major role in the water supply of the city. Scraping bedrock around the well beneath the late A levels produced no stratified fills of either the IA or the L and M BA. Gravelly fill alternating with red clays, apparently deposited naturally, lay over bedrock for a thickness of ca 50cm. It contained material which can be dated to Final N through EH II-a fragment of sauceboat, a piece of incised red burnished ware, and about a dozen small, carefully cut obsidian blades. Just S of the Eridanos river, in front of the Stoa Poikile, we excavated a series of stratified fills dating from the mid-4th to the late 6th Cts BC. The depth of fill was ca 1.2m and the area opened up, measuring 4.5 by 4.5m, proved to be totally devoid of architectural features. The principal surfaces encountered, though very hard-packed, showed little of the heavy wear or lines of traffic generally associated with road metal. It would seem, therefore, as though we have successive surfaces of the agora square proper. Several large round postholes ca 25cm in diameter and 15-40 cm deep were found cut through a surface of the early 5th Ct BC. It is tempting to interpret them as the supports for the ikria of wooden grandstands erected in the agora in the late 6th and early 5th Cts BC for theatrical performances, but not enough were exposed to allow us to discern a pattern and for the moment this must remain only an attractive hypothesis. The area excavated ran up against the stone channel of the Eridanos river, where it shows obvious signs of collapse and repair. The pottery recovered would seem to date the repairs to the 3rd or 4th Ct AD. The levels of agora floor would seem to confirm that the river was canalized in the first half of the 5th. Ct BC, presumably as part of the building program of the Stoa Poikile. The lowest agora floor which overlay bedrock contained pottery dating to the second half of the 6th Ct BC. S of modem Hadrian St. several trial trenches were opened up to explore the deep levels of the Panathenaic Way E of the Royal Stoa and N of the crossroads enclosure. Pumping the Eridanos river permitted the excavation of the deeper, earlier road levels. Generally, the history of the street could be traced back to late A times before the water level again prevented further digging. To the E packed surfaces of the mid 2nd to late 5th Cts BC were uncovered. Many were pierced with cuttings for postholes of various sizes, shapes, and depths. They were presumably to anchor wooden supports for the ikria, known to have been set up in later times for spectators of the Panathenaic procession as it passed through the NW corer of the agora. A handful of iron nails from the same area would seem to confirm this hypothesis. At certain levels, particularly of the second half of the 5th Ct, there were no postholes and the surface was unusually hard-packed, level, and smooth, with a few large stones embedded in it. The general appearance is not that of the cobbled or packed gravel surface of a road, but of a more carefully laid surface, one which perhaps served as an early running track or dromos. Elsewhere trial trenches exposed the edge of the road down to the late 6th Ct BC. Here, thick layers of hard gravel con- tained material to be associated with the Persian sack. A dozen ostraka were recovered, bearing the names of those active in the 480s BC: Hippokrates, Kallixenos, Themistokles, and Xanthippos. In the same fill was found the left hand of the small (1/3 lifesize) rider in terracotta, the torso of which was found in 1971-2 in the crossroads enclosure, ca 10m to the S, in a context of the late 5th Ct. The find spot of the hand would seem to indicate that the piece, dated on the basis of style to the 6th Ct and usually identified as an acroterion, was damaged and presumably dislodged in the Persian sack. Several other finds recovered this season deserve a special word. One, found in a road level dated no later than the middle of the 4th Ct BC, is an Athenian triobol with the canonical head of Athena and owl. Close examination showed that most of the core of the coin was of lead, with only a thin outer sheathing of silver. The coin is 12mm in diameter and weighs 2.35 gr, appreciably more than its pure silver counterparts, which fall between 1.58-1.98 gr. The style of the coin is appropriate for the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC and we have here what must be an ancient counterfeit. It apparently escaped notice during its generation or so in circulation, for it was not slashed and deposited in the Metroon according to the usual practice in the case of recognized forgeries. Underweight coins with a bronze core are more common than this lead version. From the same 4th Ct context comes a small clay disc carrying the impression of a ring or seal of some sort. It preserves a representation of the chryselephantine statue of Athena which stood in the Parthenon. Though somewhat worn, the main features of the figure can be made out. The goddess stands upright, with her helmet on and her left hand grasping the rim of the shield which rests by her side. A winged figure of Nike alights on her outstretched right hand. There is no column or support shown under the right hand; instead, the coils of the serpent Erichthonios can be discerned by her right side, transferred there from his usual position on the left, within the shield, as shown on various copies and described by Pausanias. Of the numerous ancient copies and adaptations of the Athena Parthenos, our little piece is of considerable interest not only because it comes from Athens but also because it is among the very earliest representations of one of the most celebrated statues of antiquity. Finally, an inscribed stele was found built into the founda- tions of the temple of Aphrodite which date to the Augustan period. The stele, intact and with almost every letter legible, carries a text of 43 lines recording honors for Athenian cavalry commanders, hipparchs and phylarchs, who served in the year 282/1 BC. The thirteen officers are listed by name, praised, and voted gold crowns by the tarantinoi, a detachment of light- armed cavalry. The proposer of the decree, Kallistratos the son of Termenios, is a foreigner, from Achaia, suggesting that in the early 3rd Ct the tarantinoi serving in the Athenian army were mercenaries. By the 2nd Ct BC the known tarantinoi were Athenians, serving under Athenian officers known as tarantin- archs. In addition to this new information concerning the administration and composition of the EH cavalry, the stele itself carries evidence concerning the topography of the NW corner of the agora. The secretaries of the hippeis are instructed to inscribe the honors on the stele and to set it up in the Stoa of the Herms. A second stele, passed in the same year and honoring these same officers, was found in 1962 just 40m to the NW of our new stele. It too was set up in the Stoa of the Herms. The new piece makes it increasingly likely that this famous old stoa is to be sought somewhere NW of the sanctu- ary of Aphrodite, just outside the limits of the present excava- tions." 3</page><page sequence="4">4 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 1 Kerameikos. The excavations of the DAI continued under the direction of Ursula Knigge, and concerned mainly the area of the Sacred Gate, the commencement of which had been attributed by Gerhard Kuhn to the Themistoklean fortification. A. Hess' theory that it belonged to the 430s was proved to be without foundation by a deep sounding. Bettina von Freytag investigated the so-called North tower of the Sacred Gate, and the gate passage between the curtain wall and building Y. Investigations were carried out at the monumental NW tower (Tower N), until now believed to be HL, to see whether there was a Themistoklean predecessor. Noack and Kubler had believed that this was a little further in, towards the city. Deep excavation inside tower N produced no evidence for an older tower. Cleaning, and the removal of a small surviving section of original fill revealed further A fragments, occasionally joining older finds, among them the fragment of a relief of a horseman with the legs of the horse P 1265, belonging to the upper section with rider and horse's head in the Kerameikos, and further fragments in the National Museum, possibly once decorating the base of a grave monument. Also found were a fragment of a throne leg, with drapery, and with coloured decoration, joining an inscribed fragment of a stele of a seated woman attributed by F. Willemsen to Aristokles, and the right rear leg of a sphinx (Fig. 1) to which a fragment (possibly joining) in the National Museum belongs (NM 2824). Under the spoil was a layer of red earth, described by Kubler as an extended floor, which protected still more graves. The earliest of them, an urn burial found deep in the alluvial sand of the Eridanos, comprised an amphora with a krateriskos as a lid, dating to the transition from SMyc to PG. This contained numerous pots: small lekythoi, a ring-jug, an askos etc, as well as bone fragments, a gold ring, and several spindle whorls (Fig. 2). To the same period belonged an amphora with a skyphos as its lid. An obviously late G pithos of unusual form contained the skeleton of a 25-year-old woman, but no offerings, possibly a secondary burial. A singular find, till now without parallel, is a bronze cup, dating perhaps to the middle of the 7th Ct BC, decorated with four sirens which have hammered heads and incised bodies. This comes from a cremation burial, or possibly a place of offering. It is undoubt- edly Gr, but its place of origin cannot yet be established. Soundings under building Y brought to light some fine bf and rf sherds, some of them from a bf amphora with two male heads, and a fragment of a rf lebes showing Herakles struggl- ing with the lion. In her report Dr Knigge also draws attention to an unfortu- nate consequence of the diversion of the Eridanos by the agora excavations (see above) to facilitate excavation of the water- Fig. 2</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 logged areas, which has stopped the flow of the river through the Kerameikos. Water now has to be pumped from a well to replace the flow. Plateia Kotzia. A proposal of the Ministry of Public Works to build a multi-story car park beneath this square (bounded by Athinas, Eupolidos, Aiolou and Kratinou Sts. and also know as Plateia Demarcheiou) necessitated a huge rescue excavation (6,650 m2), which lasted from May 1985 to May 1988. 0. Zachariadou and D. Kyriakou give an excellent summary of the complex final results in ADelt 43 Chr, 22-29. The excavation brought to light three ancient roads, an extensive cemetery used from PG to R times, and a group of LR pottery workshops. Much damage has been done to the antiquities beneath the W (Athinas) side of the square during the construction of the 19th Ct Demotic Theatre, which was designed by Ernest Schiller, funded by Andreas Syngros, founded in 1873 and completed in 1888. Other damage was caused by two large line-pits needed for the construction of the theatre, a later sub-station of the electricity company DEH, and underground public conveniences, also later. Roads. Beneath the E half of the square (Aiolou St.), remains of three roads were found, two of them major high- ways leading out of the city to the northern demes. In 1973 a rescue excavation in the National Bank of Greece's plot on Sophokleous and Aiolou Sts., to the SE of Plateia Kotzia, uncovered part of the defensive ditch, and a road over it from a city gate not found in the plot but likely to have been the Acharnian Gate. Road I, found in the NE part, of Plateia Kotzia, continued the line of this road, veering slightly to the W. Road II, only just within the E side of the excavation, branched E from Road I and would lie approximately beneath today's Geo. Stavrou St. Road I, the N continuation of which was found in an earlier excavation on the N side of Eupolidos St., would have formed a crossroad, just N of Plateia Kotzia's N limits, with another road, Road III, which also led north- wards. Most of Road III had been destroyed, but its remains were sufficient to show that it too would have issued from the city wall, about 70m W of Road I; a continuation of Road III may have been found in an earlier building plot to the NE of the square. Road III was the oldest of the three roads. It was founded at the end of the 6th Ct BC and remained in continu- ous use, regularly repaired and always following the same course, until the late 3rd/early 4th Ct AD. Road I was estab- lished in the first half of the 5th Ct BC, but later than the construction of the Themistoklean wall in 479 BC. It was reconstructed and improved in the 4th Ct BC, chiefly in the second half. Stratifications in a very small part of the road indicated its probable use in the 1st Ct AD and perhaps the beginning of the 2nd Ct AD. It was certainly disused by the time the pottery workshops were built in the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct AD. Like Road I, Road II was founded in the 5th Ct BC. Road I was 3.20-3.40m wide, while Road III was 4.50-4.80m in width. Cemetery. In all 498 tombs were excavated. Most of them were in the E part of the square (towards Aiolou St.), on both sides of Roads I and III. In the PG (1 burial), G (3 graves), and A (6 burials) periods, use of the area as a cemetery was sporadic. Its systematic use began in the late A period, 500-480 BC, coinciding with the establishment of Road III; 40 tombs of this period were excavated. Its acme was in the C period, for which 180 burials were found: 17 larakes, 7 pot burials, 6 sarcophagi, 47 pit graves, 27 tile graves, 3 built tombs, 3 clay cists, 1 stone cist, 67 cremations in rectangular pits and 2 ash-urns. Many were ranged along the edges of Roads I and III. A group of C tombs were founded over A tombs in the NE corer of the excavation, bordering Road I. In the EHL period, when Road I was reconstructed and provided with well-built retaining walls, the cemetery became even better organized, with funerary pedestals and periboloi adjacent to the roads; there were 63 tombs of this period. Only 13 burials occurred in the ER phase, but later R burials numbered 54; 138 tombs could not be dated. Cremation co-existed with inhumation from the A period. It occurred frequently in the late A and C periods, but became rare to non-existent from the HL period to the end of the cemetery's use. A multitude of grave goods accompanied the burials and cremations. Skyphoi and jugs were the preferred pots in G burials; pyxides and plates were also found. In the A period, bf lekythoi predominated; pyxides, jugs, plates and figurines also occurred. In C graves bf lekythoi were again abundant, as were wg lekythoi, but almost every C pot shape was represented, as well as figurines, mostly female, and clay models of birds, animals and household utensils. There was also a little gold jewellery, and some bronze mirrors and other cosmetic equipment. In the HL graves the chief finds were fusiform unguentaria and iron strigils, while in R tombs unguentaria of clay and glass predominated. Both HL and R tombs contained many varieties of gold jewellery. A number of HL and R kioniskoi, some with inscriptions, were scattered throughout the excavation or built into walls; a few fragments of sculptured grave stelai were also found. Two striking finds came from Tomb 109: a lyre made out of a tortoise-shell and a large piece of leather in a good state of preservation. In the same tomb were found six wg lekythoi, five small bowls with remains of ochre, a plastic aryballos in the form of a shell, a puppet, two bone styluses, 77 knuckle-bones etc. Pottery Workshops. After the Herulean attack on Athens in 267 AD, Plateia Kotzia ceased to be used as a cemetery and the greater part of it was taken over by groups of pottery workshops. These appear to have continued production into the 4th Ct AD, a period when Athens was flourishing. Many other R potters' establishments were found in earlier excavations in the vicinity. The workshops were most numerous in the area between Roads I and III; by this time Road I had been abandoned and only Road III remained in use. Another group of workshops was situated in the SW of the square, and had to be excavated in between the 19th Ct theatre foundations. Altogether, 27 kilns, 18 tiled-floored settling tanks, five water strorage cisterns, ten wells and a very large number of water pipes were found. Two of the kilns were circular in plan; one at least of these may have been built in the 1st Ct BC/lst Ct AD and reused in the later 3rd Ct AD. The rest were rectangular kilns, typical of the R period, built of successive coats of clay, which was often found vitrified from the heat. In most cases only the fire-boxes were preserved; these usually had their openings facing S and some of them had tiled floors. Most still retained a centrally- placed square pillar of the same construction as the walls; this supported arches, which in turn supported the floor. In one or two cases the perforated clay floor of the firing chamber had survived. From mis-fired examples, found in and around the kilns, it is known that they were producing pots (jugs, cups, plates, household utensils), lamps, tiles and acroteria. Ample evidence was found in many kilns that the fuel used was carbonized olive pits, as is often the case today. Amongst the potters' stamps which occurred on lamps and acroteria were the names AFIOAAQNIOE, POY(DO, EYTY- XHE, and KPATEPOY, all of these were in production in the period from the later years of the 3rd Ct to the first quarter of the 4th Ct AD. 5</page><page sequence="6">6 R. A. TOMLINSON The rectangular settling tanks, where the sieved clay was mixed with water to remove the last impurities, were usually 2.0-2.25m wide and up to 4.50m in length. Patches of clay were found on some of the tiled floors. Four of the settling tanks also had tile-lined walls. Other workshop areas were used for clay storage or the preparation of colouring matter. A pot containing remains of colour was found wedged into the floor of one of these areas. In another area were found a large number of shallow, basin-like pits, which must have served some similar purpose; red ochre was found in one, and lime in another. A dense network of pipes, mostly of clay, supplied the workshop areas with the necessary water, while others drained it away after use. Other buildings. 260 fragmentary walls, the use and connections of which it was impossible to determine, were also excavated. Some may have been temporary structures con- nected with the potteries. Others, LHL/ER in date, may have been temporary funerary periboloi, as they sometimes enclosed groups of tombs. The last evidence for the site's use in antiquity was a 4th Ct AD building with large rooms, careful- ly-constructed walls, and frescoes. It was built on the ruins of the pottery workshop of AIOAAQNIOE. A number of smaller building plots which made their contribution to the mosaic of ancient Athenian topography in 1988 are reported in ADelt 43 Chr. At Propylaion 11, S of the acropolis, two ?LR walls belonging to slightly different phases were discovered. At Koryze 4, S of the acropolis and SW of the temple of Olympia Zeus, minor HL and ER remains were found, but the chief feature was a 15m length of a great arched drain of the 3rd Ct AD(?) 1.5m high, 2m wide and with walls .45m thick. It was lined with waterproof plaster, and floored with more plaster and small stones. The drain was probably a continuation of one found in the adjacent plot Koryze 6 (ADelt 23 Chr, 7), which also contained evidence of the city's fortification ditch, proteichisma, and a Justinianic tower. Some walls built above the Koryze 4 section of drain were apparently constructed while it was still in use. Part of the drain was to be left open for inspection. In another part of the Koryze 4 plot, a pot burial and two conjoined stone sarcophagi with inscriptions on their narrow ends, all dating to the 2nd Ct BC, were found. Notable finds from the plot were two ER tondi, one with a relief of a locust and the other of a female form in profile, and a fine clay figurine head of Silenus dating to the 1st Ct BC. W of Philopappos Hill, outside the city walls, but within the area once enclosed by the Long Walls, remains of a 4th Ct BC potter's workshop were identified at Balabane 4. Three late 3rd/early 2nd Ct tile graves had been cut into it, and part of a 3rd Ct BC inscribed kioniskos was also found. A 4th Ct BC wall found at Balabane 6 and Pamphiles may have belonged to an out-building connected with the Balabane 4 workshop. In the same area, at Kallisthenous 36, remains of another workshop (clay floor and drainage pipe) of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC were located. Seven later tombs of various kinds were cut into it, some of them datable (by tear-flasks) to the 2nd Ct BC. Other grave goods included loomweights and metal objects, and one gold earring terminating in an antelope head. At Poulopoulou 37 in the Theseion district, a 14m-long stretch of the city's C fortification wall was found. It was estimated that it would have been just N of the Peiraic Gate. The wall was to remain visible in the basement of the new building. At Erysichthonos 3-5 in the same locality, large blocks from the dismantling of the city wall, which had been built into the foundations of adjacent houses, were noted. Fifteen tombs were excavated in the NW part of a plot at Kerameikou 44 and Giatrakou; there may have been more, but the work had to stop because of a technicality. The tombs were: 1 cist, 6 pit graves, 2 tile graves, 2 clay larakes, 1 poros sarcophagus and 3 pyres. They dated chiefly to the 5th Ct BC, and were probably part of the important cemetery connected with the Erial Gate. All the tombs had been badly damaged by later activity. Remaining grave goods included many bf lekythoi and other small pots, alabastra, a bronze mirror, an iron strigil, a number of broken female figurines and two clay doves. A stele with a sculptured banqueting scene bore the inscription: OIAOKPATHX ANTIKPATO(Y)Z MEAITEYZ XPYZIAAA MIKIQNOZ ANA(YZTIOZ. Part of another stele, a complete kioniskos and broken one, all of them inscribed, were also found. A single sarcophagus of shelly limestone containing a disturbed skeleton, two plain coarseware one-handled pots and two corroded iron strigils, came to light in a plot at Lenorman 129. Plataion 59 contained part of the wide road that ran from the Dipylon gate to the Academy. The test, 10.85m long, was positioned across the width of the road, but despite this, the retaining walls of the road were not found. Thirteen trodden surfaces were distinguished, some with wheel ruts. The road dated to the 4th Ct BC. An acroterion bearing the stamp AnOAAQNIOZ was found. At Peiraios 82 and Salaminos in the same vicinity, another road was discovered, running parallel to today's Peiraios St., and likely to have joined the road to the Academy at right-angles. It too had wheel-ruts in its uppermost surface. It was in use from C to ER, and a few Myc sherds in some of its strata suggest a much earlier presence in the area. Parts of ten walls belonging to two chronologically close phases, not otherwise datable, and not forming any structure, were also found on the plot, as were four tombs, one of which could be dated to the 2nd Ct BC. At Platanos 105, a length of wall which ran SW-NE, and extended beyond the plot at either end, was identified as part of the E wall of the peribolos of the Academy, towards its N end. It was 1.40-1.45m wide, preserved to a height of 1.65m in four courses, and was dated to the late 4th Ct BC. It was to remain visible in the basement of the new building. At Basilican 73 and Timaiou Lokrou, a systematic excava- tion took place in an expropriated plot which formed the NW quarter of a city block. The areas to the E and S of it were investigated by the original excavator of the Academy, P. Aristophronas, and the excavation was being funded by a legacy from a member of his family. Though a deep sounding reached PR levels, most of the work in 1988 dealt with R-LR remains. The work was to continue and the final results were to be collated with those from the earlier excavations. Finds were photographed and recorded; they were: five inscribed kioniskoi from the 1933 excavations, a funerary loutrophoros of marble, and the body of a R male statue wearing chiton and himation. They were removed to the archaeological collection and store of the Academy excavations at Kratylou 20. ATTICA (2nd Ephorate and Eleusis and Megara) Aegosthena-Eleutherae. An extensive cleaning programme took place in 1988. Alepochori (anc. Pagai). In 1988 clearing and surface excava- tion concentrated on locating the E fortification wall of the ancient acropolis. The NE tower had had two later rooms</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 7 added to it and an entrance cut in its E side; the foundations of a gateway in the SW part of the acropolis also had later additions. Remains of a possible public building were located to the NE of the acropolis, just outside the walls. Pygari hill-S Tsafre plot. Part of one of the cemeteries of ancient Pagai was located here. The closely packed tombs (17 visible on the plan) were all on the same E-W orientation, and of the same type: in effect, shaft-graves cut into the soft bedrock, the initial cutting followed by a second cutting in the floor. Some of these lower pits had small rectangular cuttings in two or four comers to receive the legs of a coffin or bier; many iron nails in the fill also bear witness to their use. Cover slabs were laid across the top of the lower pit, resting on the shelf formed by the base of the upper pit. There is no evidence to show how the upper pit was filled. There may have been funerary stelai; part of one, with a fragmentary inscription, was found in a tomb fill. The first tombs were cut in the mid 5th Ct BC. The cemetery was also used in the 3rd Ct BC and its latest use was in the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC. The graves were repeatedly robbed from ER to Byz times, but lagynoi, perfume flasks, jugs, coins, figurines, scraps of bronze and gold leaf were found, usually mixed with thrown-up bones around the cover slabs. S of the tombs were the foundations of part of a Byz building, consisting of at least seven identical pairs of rooms, each pair with a hearth. It may have been part of a monastery or barracks. Brauron. The press report the excavation of a cave containing the remains of animals 20,000 years old (including bears) together with human remains. Chersonesos tou Teichos: Agia Triada. Three buildings were investigated in this locality, 8.7km SE of Megara. A C building (5th Ct BC?) of grey limestone blocks, 18.45 x 14.48m in plan, with walls still standing 1.8m high, had been incorporated into the centre of a R building, 21 rooms being built round it. Another R building just to the NW of it had five rooms, some of which contained built circular ovens on square bases, and another a hearth. The third building, at a little distance, was probably erected during the War of Independence, some time after 1818, when the building of the Chersonesos fortifications began. Eleusis. Excavations for the Archaeological Service were directed by Prof. Kosmopoulo (University of Manitoba) on the site of the PR settlement on the SW slope of the hill above the sanctuary. Under remains of the R period were found sherds of LH IIIA1-IIIA2. No fewer than eleven rescue excavations are reported for 1988 in ADelt 43. Eight of them had substantial results, often of several periods, and the plans accompanying the reports are very helpful. On Kynegeirou (OT 259 &amp; 260) the excavation of a ditch for stormwater drainage just N of the TITAN factory hit a group of seven Myc ChTs. They are in the W cemetery area of Eleusis, a few metres NE of section 0 of Prof Mylon- as' excavation. All except T VII suffered damage from the mechanical excavator. T I, which had the blocking wall at the end of its long dromos in situ, and contained at least nine adult burials, was the best preserved. The tombs dated from LH IIIA1 to LH IIIB2, and were to be published in a separate article. Two plots on Papagianne (OT 196) each contained a section of a well-built and well-preserved ancient drain, constructed of lengths of terracotta piping, F-shaped in section, with removable covers; tt ran from E to W. There were no other antiquities and few sherds in the plots, and though two very small, worn bg sherds were found when cleaning the drain, the evidence was too slight to allow a firm date to be assigned. A plot at Kougioumtzoglou &amp; Are Belouchiote (OT 185) yielded 44 tombs and four walls of unworked stones, possibly part of a funerary peribolos. The most common form of grave was cremation in a rectangular pit (17), followed by ur burials in pithoi and amphoras (15), and tile graves (6, one a child). Other types were: a child burial in an elliptical lamax, a child burial in a cist made of tiles, and three pit graves, one with covers of unworked limestone slabs. There were also two rough pits, perhaps not tombs. Funerary offerings were meagre, more than half the graves having none. Those that were found dated from the end of G to the end of C. Tests to bedrock showed that the area had been occupied in the EH and MH periods. As well as PR sherds, there were a lump of daub from a roof, a bronze object which was probably part of a pair of tweezers, and ten blades of Melian obsidian which had apparently been worked locally. At Demetros 14 (OT 123) a LG-EA cemetery, LC-ER house remains and part of the R aqueduct were found. The cemetery was first used at the end of the G period, and contained 31 ur burials, 14 pyres, 3 pit graves and a place for offerings. Coarse, undecorated pithoi, rough clay pots with incised motifs, or amphoras with painted sub-G decoration were used for the ur burials, and some of them were accom- panied by other smaller pots (1 to 7) as funerary offerings. Among the latter were proto-Corinthian vases, contemporary Attic pottery of the Phaleron type, and small jugs of 'Argive' monochrome ware, which may in fact have been produced locally. The small size of the plots used for the burials, and the small bones of the skeletons, where they survived, indicated that they were those of children and infants. None of the pyres had any offerings, but the pits in which they were found were too small for adult cremations, so they too were probably for the cremation of children, or else used for some funerary ceremony. In the late A or EC period, a torrent changed its course and flooded the cemetery, swept away the tops of the graves, and prevented its further use. (It was probably the Eleusinian Kephissos, later called the Sarandapotamos because of its supposed forty channels, resulting from its frequent changes). In the late C period, buildings were founded on the stratum of sand, gravel and other flood detritus left by the torrent, and despite some evidence of further flooding, occupation con- tinued until the ER period. The narrow walls, of unworked stones bonded with clay, and the modest domestic nature of the associated finds, suggest that the area was used for simple dwellings. This is of interest because the plot is outside the city walls, and the previously held belief, that the city of Eleusis spread beyond its walls only in the R-LR period, needs to be re-examined in the light of the results of this excavation. The R aqueduct of Eleusis was on a different orientation from the earlier remains. It bordered a central street of the R city which followed approximately the same course as today's Demetrios St. Only the foundations of the aqueduct and the bases of its arches were found in this plot, but other, better preserved sections of it are known from previous excavations (AR 1993-4, 9). At Eleutheriou Benizelou and Skorda (OT 146) a strong wall built of large rectangular blocks, which ran right across the plot and continued beyond it at either end, probably formed part of a public building. It was dated to the LC/HL period, more by virtue of its architecture than by the contents of the</page><page sequence="8">8 R. A. TOMLINSON disturbed fill near it. Beneath it was part of an A structure, with two of its rooms falling partly within the plot. One was of a semi-basement character, and only A fine ware was found in it, including two early lekythoi. The position of this A building, only 300m NW of the sanctuary, precludes its having been part of a settlement, and although nothing of its contents suggests a liturgical function, it is interesting that it was succeeded by a probable public building. A later, probably R structure was built against one face of the C/HL wall. It was lined with waterproof plaster, and was probably a cistern. In a plot in the side street Sot. Gkioka (OT 140a) were remains of almost all periods of the ancient site. The upper- most level produced part of a LR building which lay beneath a destruction level. Its E wall was a reused exterior wall of an earlier LC/HL building. In a test below one of its rooms, a well-built C wall was encountered. Beneath this were remains of many small, narrow walls of unworked stones bonded with mud, built one on top of another. A and Myc strata were encountered, as well as a level with remains of conflagration such as often occurs at Eleusis in areas where PR buildings are found. At the foundation level of the earliest walls, three intra- mural burials were noted. One of them was a cist built of stone slabs, containing a child's skeleton without grave goods. The most important PR find was a complete LH IIIB rhyton. Three occupation phases, all R, were found in a plot in the side street Kontoule 39 (OT 68). The uppermost, LR, had handsome exterior walls of well-dressed blocks (probably reused) and internal ones of much poorer construction. To this phase belonged a floor of square terracotta tiles in the SW part of the excavation, with a reused marble stele set into it. Part of another stele, a herm, also turned up in the LR phase, which preserved part of an honorific decree. The phase preceding the LR one was built on a different orientation, and consisted of fragmentary wall foundations, gravelled floors and part of a paved one, clay pipes connected with a rectangular structure built of fired bricks, a well lined with clay rings, and two smaller structures, one four-sided, the other hemispherical, and both plaster-lined. This was probably some kind of industrial establishment. The phase is dated by a bronze sestertius of Hadrian. To this phase also belonged a circular structure in the SW of the plot. It had a raised circular platform in its centre so that a 30cm wide channel was left round its circumference. A covered pi-sectioned clay pipe led from this NW to an underground well-like construction, which had its stone built walls carefully plastered and its mouth covered by a stone slab. Its function is not absolutely certain, but it is reasonably suggested that it could have been an oil- press. The earliest of the three R phases had narrow walls and a clay floor, suggesting a private dwelling. It seemed to have suffered a sudden destruction, possibly by fire. Below its remains there were some indications of the area's use in the C period. At Bas. Laskou 13 (OT 86) a large wall, probably LC, ran NW-SE right across the plot and continued beyond it in both directions. One of its faces was very well built, of local grey Eleusinian stone, in the irregular trapezoidal style, with the interstices filled with stacks of small, flat stones, and had been carefully hammer-dressed. The other face was left quite irregular, because the wall acted as a retaining wall for an earth terrace on that side. Excavation of the terrace brought two tile graves to light, at right angles to the wall, but parallel to each other. (Neither contained any funerary offerings). The wall's worked face may have been the border of an ancient road, with tombs set in the terrace alongside it. A continuation of both the wall and the funerary terrace may have been found previously in a plot to the SE (ADelt 30 Chr, 43). Two fragmentary walls of later R(?) phases were also found. In a plot at Peisistratou 72 (OT 21), which is 10m from the S fence of the archaeological site, the remains of two walls which had bordered a 4th/3rd Ct BC road were found. The road was approximately 7m wide, ran N-S and continued beyond the excavation's limits in both directions. About 3m W of the road's W edge, and almost on the same orientation, a narrow R wall also ran N-S the length of the excavation. A square, stone-built structure approximately 1.20m on each side was found just E of this wall, and a clay pipe with a rectangu- lar section ran through the N end of the wall at right angles, then E over the top of the C/HL road's W wall (which was probably then no longer visible). The abundant murex shells which lay between the square structure and the drain suggest that these R remains could have been part of an industrial installation for producing purple dye. Excavation had to cease only 1.10m below the moder surface when the water table was reached. No other antiquities had been found in this part of Eleusis to date, and the location of the road, which probably ran to the harbour, and the remains of an R industry, were interesting additions to the topography of the ancient city. On the corer of Perikleous and Salaminos (again, 10m from the fence of the ancient site) a cable ditch being exca- vated for the Electricity Company laid bare part of a substan- tial ancient wall. Although it was acknowledged that no firm conclusion could be based on so small a length of wall (the trench was only .6m wide) the possibility that it was part of the ancient stadium was discussed. No remains of the stadium had been found up to 1988, and it was suggested that the wall could be an element for further research on the subject. Geraka. The press report the discovery of a building plausibly identified as the temple of Pallenian Athena. Only the poros foundations remain, and a poros triglyph, dated to ca 500 BC, built into the wall of a nearby church. Megara. For 1988, 23 rescue excavations in and near Megara are reported in ADelt 43. Seven of the sites contained parts of the ancient cemeteries to the NW, SW, S and N of the city. They produced 44 tombs between them. The most usual grave type was the stone sarcophagus (37) or stone cist (7), both always hewn from the soft, white shelly local stone noted by Pausanias (1.9); they date to the 5th-2nd Cts BC. Many other plots produced meagre remains of walls, C to E Byz, with the majority HL. One of the more interesting ones was at Dogane 27, where part of a HL oil press was found. The press itself lay partly under the neighbouring plot, but the rectangular collec- tion-tank floor, lined with waterproof plaster, was visible. A channel all round its edge led to a hole which drained off the water and detritus from the pressing into a stone vessel. Another rectangular structure next to it may have been built earlier, but was reused during the pressing. Part of a 4th Ct building was discovered elsewhere in this plot. Two bottle-shaped cisterns were found at Dogane 13 and Grebenon and Eleutheriou Benizelou 22; the fill of the former contained many 5th Ct sherds. Parts of two roads were investigated. One, at G. Mavro- kake 48 and M Zacharia, was a major highway which may have started at the SW corner of the ancient agora, while the one in Omerou (a continuation of a road previously excavated at Phaidonos 17-ADelt 34 Chr, 52) perhaps led to one of the city gates, as yet unlocated. Large, stone-built open storm water gutters ran along at least one side of each of these roads,</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 and in both cases beyond the gutters were the remains of the roads' facing walls. The latest, plastered surface of the Omerou road contained many small stones, HL sherds and a figurine head. Two sites on the NE edge of the town gave valuable information about Megara's C fortifications (end 5th Ct-first decade of the 4th Ct BC). In Papaconstantinou 37 part of the wall's trace ran across the plot from SE-NW, with a very small part of a semicircular tower at its W edge. NW of this, in the planned extension of Mykenon St., were the last remains of another semicircular tower, with parts of the proteichisma a little to the E of it. W of this tower the wall changed direction and ran E-W. Approximately 18m W of the Mykenon semicir- cular tower, a square tower projected N from the wall. On the S (interior) side of this section of the wall, remains of a staircase to the battlements were found. The wall consisted of two faces built of large rectangular blocks of white or pale, reddish-brown poros, with up to three courses preserved, and evidence for a fourth course. The blocks were laid lengthwise along the wall's face in pairs, or across it, singly, in alternating courses, and the central space was packed with small stones and pebbles set in mud. The basic width of the wall was 3.99m. Its upper courses would have been of mud brick. Two road surfaces were found, one just within the fortifications (in the Papaconstantinou plot) and one between the main fortifica- tions and the proteichisma (in the Mykenon extension). The possible existence of a gateway between the two semicircular towers is discussed. At Elikonos 16-18 part of a 4th Ct proteichisma was found. Peta. Wall-paintings discovered in the church of-Ag. Theodor- oi (ADelt 41 Chr, 24), including a Virgin blachernitissa in the apse, possibly with a donor portrait, were located underneath later plaster covering. They have been tentatively dated to the late 12th early 13th Ct. E. Gkini-Tsophopoulou suggests that three fragmentary 2-3rd Ct AD inscriptions found in the masonry of the same structure may have been part of tituli memoriales inscriptions from the nearby temple of the Megaloi Theoi at Kephalethen. (ADelt 43 Chr, 86-87) Ramnous. B. Petrakos reports on his work in 1994 in Ergon 15-21. Excavation in front of the S wall confirmed the date of construction for that section in the last two decades of the 5th Ct BC. The road from the S gate to the theatre was cleared; at its junction with the road from the E gate was the Strategoi, the place where the Rhamnousians set up stelai with decrees honouring the strategoi of the paralia. Ten more bases for stelai were found, and an inscribed foundation of the end of the 4th century. Continuation of the excavation to the N revealed later construction of reused material, including two dedicatory reliefs of the 4th century, the first of the Athenian thesmothetai, the second of the thesmothetes of Aiantis Teleskopos son of Aristokritos, honoured in 327/6, the year after he held office. Further clearing was done in the area of the theatre and agora, originally excavated by Stais. In the W part of the orchestra was found an altar, presumably dedicated to Diony- sos. Another, N of the proedria of the theatre, was dedicated to Hermes. The superstructure of a third altar was found and restored on its euthynteria. Restoration of the fortifications, begun in 1993, was continued with the great tower on the right of the S gate. Skala Oropou. On the Ioustinianou 1-Photopoulos plot, part of a LR/ECh building, consisting of two walled spaces, was excavated. A destruction level 1.50m deep included roof tiles, plaster, ashes and numerous iron nails. Broken plain ware amphoras, sherds of dipinto ware, remains of glass vessels, a marble basin and a marble mortar, and many animal bones were also found. In the N room two small kilns were built side by side, but conditions prevented their complete excavation. Part of a female figurine was found at foundation depth in the S room. It was uncertain whether the rooms were auxiliary areas of a private house or a workshop. (ADelt 43) Sounion. The Archaeological Service began a systematic investigation of the fortified area. Two areas were excavated: tower 13, and a small shrine W of tower 7. Tower 13 was built of marble on the exterior, local poros on the interior. As a consequence of forest fires (AR 1993-94, 11-12) Hans Goette (DAI) was able to carry out a survey of the area within the walls. This revealed that the wall also enclosed the S side of the site. It established that the interior was laid out on a grid plan, which must be interpreted as a town, not merely a fortification. During this work a fragment of a decree of the soldiers stationed at Sounion, dated to 298/7BC, was found in surface levels. Thorikos. The Archaeological Service celebrated the centenary of the excavation by Stais of the Doric building, probably dedicated to Demeter and Kore, by re-excavating it from the silt brought down by a torrent bed which had since covered it, and taking measures for its future preservation, despite difficulties caused by a recurrence of the flooding. Among the discoveries was that of the name Euphrosynos inscribed on the stylobate, presumably at the time the columns were removed for reuse in the Athenian agora. Voula. In the Papaflessa-OT 138-Paschalinou plot were found three parallel ancient terraces, running approximately SE-NW, rising towards the NW. On the second terrace the foundations of a small shrine were found, 3.50 x 2.30m in plan and consisting of a pronaos and sekos; its entrance was in the NE. The sekos had a plaster floor, in the W corner of which was set a stone base with a central, rectangular hollow, perhaps for offerings. Immediately to the SE of this was a square opening in the plaster, possibly for another such base; in it was found a small bronze arrowhead. The shrine was founded in the mid 5th Ct and remained in use to about the mid 4th Ct BC. Part of a large building was found near Papaflessa St., and con- tinued beneath it. All along the interior of its main wall was a heavy destruction level of stones and Lakonian roof tiles. In and beneath this destruction were many sherds from the walls, extension rings and flat lids of cylindrical clay beehives-parts of at least 25 lids were recognized. The beehives were similar to those found at Trachones (BSA 68 (1973), 443) which were possibly associated with a shrine in that vicinity. West Attica Survey. In 1988 the results were reported of a survey of west Attica conducted over some years. The area was divided into four zones: 1. Ancient Attica and part of Boiotia (39 sites, mainly known from earlier literature, but with new sites near Mandra, the Koundouroi valley and Oinoe). 2. The Megarid (46 sites, mostly unknown or mentioned only in recent bibliographies). 3. The Thriasian plain and Aspropyrgos (11 sites, mostly R, with indications of others). 4. The Kinetta district and the shore of Geraneia (4 sites in the mountain zone, one possibly a sanctuary). The main conclusion was that the inaccessible mountainous zone of west Attica, and especially the Megarid, was thickly settled with small villages on the mountain-sides. Near these were often isolated country houses incorporating towers, which may have been partly for adminis- trative purposes, especially control of the roads. In ancient 9</page><page sequence="10">10 R. A. TOMLINSON Attica, besides its forts (Eleutherai-Oinoe) there were isolated settlements chiefly concerned with agriculture or animal husbandry. The towers and forts here were for purely military purposes, while the country houses were rare. The sites have been photographed and marked on Greek Army Survey maps for future reference. ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF, etc (2nd Ephorate and Kea) Aigina. The Austrian Institute (University of Salzburg) continued excavations in the PR town west of the temple of Apollo. Almost all the northern area of houses was excavated, with the exception of one house, confirming that the regularly arranged quarter excavated by G. Welter belonged to the late MH period. Below this are the walls of N, EH, and EMH houses. Other significant discoveries included extensive strata of pure N material; house and terrace walls of this period; a large sequence of anthropomorphic figurines, male and female, from the transition from late N to early EH; evidence for extensive rebuilding in the second half of EH II; and evidence for close contact with the Cyclades in EH II, while the finds of EH III suggest a violent destruction of the settlement. The high quality of finds from all periods is notable. Salamis. For 1988, three excavations are reported, all with tombs. In a plot on Leophoros Demokratias, belonging to the School Buildings Organisation, an 1 lm-wide road was found, which probably began at the ancient city of Salamis. The road ran SE to NW, and on both sides were found stretches of its facing walls, supporting the remains of funerary periboloi. Tombs on either side of the road towards its NW end (cist graves with walls of unworked stones, tile graves and an amphora burial) suffered from inundation and looting. They were all inhumations. One cist had three glass tear flasks, a tile grave had a bg pyxis and a round-bellied tear flask decorated with thin bands of red-brown paint. Some small plain pots about im from the amphora may have been associated with it. The most interesting tomb group was in peribolos A at the SE end of the NE side of the road. It had five graves, A-E, all containing inhumations. Tomb A (a cist of unworked slabs) had a skeleton with a bronze mirror by its right hand, a pyxis lid near its right shin, an alabastron at each shoulder and, to the right of the skull, a rf squat lekythos with a representation of Nike. Tomb B (poros sarcophagus) contained only a skeleton with an iron strigil. Tomb r (a stone built cist, founded partly on top of Tomb E and at a higher level than A and B) preserved another bronze mirror, iron nails from the bier, a very worn bronze coin and fragments of the legs. Tomb A (sarcophagus of shelly limestone) had poor remains of a skeleton and a bronze mirror with a handle and a suspension ring. Tomb E (sarcophagus of shelly limestone), badly destroyed, had in its fill a clay tear flask, two fusiform unguentaria, fragments of an iron strigil and a rf 5th Ct BC sherd showing a seated female form. Funerary monuments pertaining to the tombs may have been ranged along the fronts of the periboloi beside the road, as several were found apparently fallen from above onto the road surface. These included the fragment of a funerary stele preserving part of a female foot, a marble lekythos with a reception scene, and a kioniskos. Further NW on the road was part of a marble funerary stele with a pediment, inscribed 25m N of peribolos A, and parallel with the road's facing walls, were three lengths of another retaining wall which may have bordered a second funerary road parallel to the first. 28m NW of this again was another slab cist, with a skeleton with an iron pin and two squat lekythoi, one with a Perseus protome. On the Ambelakion-Selenion road, 500m W of Ambelakia's cemetery church of Agios Nikolaos, a stone slab cist was found with a skeleton which had a squat lekythos near each hand. In the Gkika-Kiabourake plot on Leophoros Salaminas and Matrozou three fragmentary amphora burials and a tile grave were discovered, as well as two more amphoras in a cremation pit which lay partly beneath the tile grave. A group of 4th Ct BC pottery not associated with any of these, but probably coming from a destroyed tomb, included, inter alia, a bf lekythos depicting Herakles with the Erymanth- ian (ADelt says Kalydonian) boar. KORINTHIA (4th Ephorate) No report was submitted to ADelt 43 Chr. Corinth. ASCS excavations: C.K. Williams II reports: "Excavation this year focused on two 13th and 14th Ct AD units that lie S of the archaeological museum. Unit 1 is a large rectangular structure with a paved central court; the second is unit 2, a monastery or convent with a church of Byz plan at its SW corer. Both units help to define a large public gravelled court. The area has been under excavation since 1989 and has been reported yearly in Hesperia. This year the purpose was to finish excavating certain rooms of these two Frankish com- plexes which were only partially explored in 1993, including the SE corer room of unit 1, which is identified as a phar- macy. Here in 1993 a large number of pharmaceutical con- tainers were found, including six albarelli, or drug pots, and seven ovoid bodied jars, one of which comes from Mameluke Egypt. This pharmacy was connected to the larger room to its S by a large doorway. This larger room was excavated in 1994. Unfortunately, its floor was completely devoid of finds. It may well have been a dormitory. The SW comer of unit 1 is still unexposed, but room 12, along the S end of the W flank of the building, was excavated this season. Its only preserved access is by the paved central court of the unit. The room had two superimposed plaster floors, unique in this complex. Built over the W wall of room 12 is a later vaulted structure, rhomboid in plan. The chamber extends W for an interior E-W length of 1.07m and is vaulted to 1.70m above the earth floor. Unfortunately very little is preserved of the structure to which this crypt originally belonged. The associ- ated occupation level, a floor immediately E of the entrance into the vaulted chamber, was distinguishable at 86.63m above sea level, but otherwise the area was too badly disturbed to allow one to determine the plan of the later building. The chamber may have served as a small root cellar for the storage of supplies demanding a cool place. Finds included 83 com- plete or largely complete glazed tableware vessels, 39 or more in cooking-ware fabric, at least 23 in coarse-ware, including 11 fragmentary amphoras, and over 34 glass vessels, including an assortment of faunal material. Fragments of egg-shell, appar- ently chicken, were found throughout the fill, as were bird and fish bones, fish scales, a variety of sea-shells, the remains of sea urchins and tortoise shells and three kittens. Most common, however, were the skeletal remains of sheep and goat, includ- ing skulls and horns. These two types of animals must have supplied the bulk of the table meat.</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 11 A series of hard road surfaces are built up against the W wall of unit 1. The roadmetal into which the W wall of the unit was dug is in places as much as a meter higher than the later floor found within 12. Circulation in the street was heavy enough to pack the discrete levels into crusts of roadmetal. A stone wall defines the W side of this 3.38m wide roadway. This probably is a compound wall or a wall protecting the limits of monastic property. In its late 13th Ct phase it was punctuated by an opening immediately west of room 13 of unit 1. Immediately outside the enclosure wall stands yet one more Frankish building. Although relatively narrow in its overall N-S dimension, the one room of this structure that was excavated in 1994 has extremely deep foundations. These descend through soft fill onto the ruins of the hypocaust of a Roman bath. The only distinguishing features preserved in the Frankish room were a clay floor, a bench, and a small built oven. The date for the erection of this building should be put within the late third or early in the fourth quarter of the 13th Ct. Unit 2 stands immediately N and NE of unit 1. Part of it may have stood before the Frankish conquest of the Morea; it went through at least two radical alterations before it apparent- ly ceased to exist as a monastery or convent. Apparently it was planned as a rectangle ca 36m wide from E to W. The N-S dimension is still to be determined by future excavation, for only the S side of the unit has been cleared. The description of the area excavated this year starts with room A at the SW corner of the original complex and con- tinues in sequence along the S side eastwards towards the church. Room A is fully excavated and now stands cleared to its original tiled floor. It is between ca 5m wide at its W and 5.20m wide at its E end; it is ca 5.30m from its E to its W wall. Only one entrance is attested for it, in its E wall leading to room B. Rooms A, B,and C have paved floors; the tiles are roughly square and are larger than those used anywhere in unit 1, ranging between 39 and 51cm to a side. Room C may well be the nucleus of a residential-reception area within unit 2, even though one cannot as yet determine the position of its E wall. It has two doorways, each with marble threshold, one connecting it with room B at its W, the other with a court to its N. In both the jambs are constructed with monumental blocks, although reused without having been retrimmed. The center of the floor in room C was removed when a large pit was dug from an overlying level through the tiles. Room C probably had been divided, and thus probably another room, D, lay between it and the narthex of the church. It had direct access into the narthex. Immediately W of unit 1 was found part of the hypocaust of a R bath. This appears to have had at least two phases and may have been built over a building of the Augustan period. One cannot tell if the Augustan building also was a bath. Very little of this structure has been exposed; only one side of a room with hypocaust, a small reservoir and a herringbone tile floor attest to the function of the building. Once cleared it will apparently occupy the space between the S limit of the temenos of temple E and the E-W paved roadway with side- walk that is exposed in the SW part of the excavation area." Isthmia. The Ohio State University expedition under T. Gregory continued conservation of the monochrome mosaic in the R bath. A further 35 sections were relaid, bringing the total in three years to 104. In the E field (AR 1993-94, 14-15) detailed investigation of the stratigraphy of two trenches excavated by Paul Clement was carried out. In trench 94-3 two successive floors were identified and associated with their appropriate walls, providing an important fixed point for the understanding of this complex area, and confirming that there was considerable activity here in the 3rd Ct AD, and shedding light on the architectural environment of the so-called cult tunnel in the area. E. Gebhard reports on the continuing studies by the University of Chicago: "At the Rachi settlement, on the basis of the contours of the ridge, the total number of houses may not have exceeded 30. They are composed of a basement, workroom, and either a separate courtyard with cistern or a combined workroom courtyard with cistern. Most had two or three additional rooms. If the basement was deep enough a separate workroom was built over it, but there is little evidence for a true second storey. The houses are small in comparison with examples from HL cities, but the room size seems standard. Examination of marble sculpture fragments excavated by Broneer included three slightly over life sized statues, perhaps officials, members of the imperial family, or deities, and one figure that may represent a priest. The statues very probably stood in the precinct of the Antonine temple of Palaimon." ARGOLIS (4th Ephorate) No report was submitted for ADelt 43 Chr. Berbati. B. Wells (Swedish Institute) reports: "The 1994 season focused on two objectives: the area of the tholos tomb and the R bath. During the surface survey in 1990 a cult place was identified by the tholos tomb. An A deposit was found, datable to the late 7th to early 6th Ct BC, closely associated with the tumulus once covering the tholos tomb. The R bath, conclusively identified in the surface survey of 1988-90, was documented photographically, and through the employment of electronic total stations and GPS. A CAD map was produced of the area of the villa as recorded by the survey." Epidauros. B Lambrinoudaki (AS) carried out work in the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas, at the skana, where support walls were constructed. During cleaning of the R peribolos, traces of the H peribolos were found. Restoration work was also carried out at the R propylon, and the S baths. Midea. Joint excavations under the direction of Dr Katie Demakopoulou in collaboration with Prof. P. Astrom resulted in the complete clearance of the passageway inside the E gate leading up to an inner gate. The passage had never been completed. It was blocked by huge boulders of living rock which were in the process of being cut away when the citadel was struck by earthquake at the end of LH IIIB2; the cutting marks are still visible. Further up, a room adjacent to the citadel wall was excavated. It contained levels of grey and red ash and fallen large mudbricks from the citadel wall. In a corner of the room a victim of the earthquake was found: the skeleton of a young girl (or boy), whose skull and body had been crushed by falling stones. Mycenae. Dr E.B. French reports: "Three programmes of work had been planned for this summer but in the event only two could be undertaken: New museum. The important results of the testing in the area of the western approach to the new museum mean that the actual excavation has continued until mid August and that the contractor will not be able to complete work and turn the building over to the Archaeological Service until the end of the</page><page sequence="12">12 R. A. TOMLINSON year. Further planning for the move and consultations on shelving, etc, were undertaken, but no actual work. Mycenae survey. In four weeks of work by myself with the assistance of Dr Kim Shelton, a rough draft of the whole publication has been produced (with the various indexes) and roughs of all the maps at 1:2,500. Further editing both of the text and the database will be carried out during the coming winter. Already the article by Dr Shelton concerning the identification of the tombs excavated by Tsountas has been submitted to the Archaeological Society for publication in the Archaiologike Ephemeris; specialist reports are awaited from Anton Jansen, on the road system, and Susan Miller on the quarries. In addition to the editing we visited and recorded all the sites either identified or damaged since last season; the former included more tombs, a quarry and a stretch of road previously unknown, the latter one of the crossings on the road to the Argive Heraion which has been heavily bulldozed. Wace excavations: the temple. Dr Nancy Klein was able to incorporate her work on the temple into my own pro- gramme. She has undertaken the detailed publication of the results of work in 1939 on the A temple; the notebooks and the detailed plans exist and some of the sherd material, though some of the latter has been lost. This year she spent a week in Mycenae and Nauplion. She re-checked the finds in Nauplion and completed a series of measured drawings of the surviving blocks on the citadel. The week was dogged by extremely high winds, but on the last day she was able to use the level on the site, taking further elevations related to those taken in 1939 and linking the plan to the overall survey. Earlier she gave a talk on her interpretations to date at the Swedish Centenary Colloquium on Sanctuaries in the Peloponnese." ARKADIA (5th Ephorate) Asea Valley Survey. Dr J. Forsen (Swedish Institute) reports on the first field season: "As a result of the intensive archaeological surface survey carried out in an area of 10km2, sites spanning the middle N to the present day, i.e. from ca 6000 BC to the 19th Ct AD were recorded. Close to 1,600 artifacts were collected from the sites and tracts walked, and will be the subject of a planned study season. Geological samples were taken from all our sites and will be analysed with the means of GIS in connection with the topographical study of the Asea Valley carried out concurrently with the survey work. The sole pollen sample taken this season gave a negative result, no pollen having survived the viciss- itudes of the dry climate. The diachronic study of the demo- graphic fluctuations in the valley gave some preliminary results. Four N sites occasionally produce slight evidence of continuity into the EBA. So far there are no single-period sites of any of the sub-phases of the BA, which is surprising when we look at other Peloponnesian survey results, where especially the EH II period stands out and is usually well represented by easily diagnosed pottery material. A probable peak in the habitation history of the Asea valley is not documented until between the 4th and 2nd Cts BC. After this period a certain decline seems to have occurred in the valley during the R period, when Pausanias, for instance, describes the polis of Asea as in ruins. However, this does not mean that we lack R sites; on the contrary, we have even found newly established sites, especially from LR times, in the area. Subsequently a virtual 'Dark Age' is documented from the LR period until the 11th Ct AD. A great proportion of the artifacts found this season dates to the 13th Ct, by which we postulate a peak in population in the valley during this time. The next and last peak in population occurred in the 19th and early 20th Ct AD. Once a more thorough study of the ceramic material has been made we expect to be able to create a more detailed pattern of the fluctuations in the valley's settlement history. It is worth mentioning that in the survey we have found very little so- called 'background noise'. Although it is too early to calculate mean background densities, this could mean that the Asea valley was less densely settled throughout the past than other survey area. The survey work has so far revealed one clear change in settlement pattern, and that is that, contrary to the sites of all other periods documented until now, no Med or early Mod sites are situated on the plain itself. They lie instead on the slopes of the surrounding hills and mountains. It is difficult to establish the reasons for this withdrawal of settlements from the valley bottom, but one reason might be the strong erosional phase which seems to have occurred during R or early post-R times. Strong erosion could have created repeated seasonal floodings of parts of the valley floor, thus making the plain more prone to malaria and thereby unsuitable for habitation. However, another interpretation of the data is also possible, namely that the population increase during the Med period resulted in a need for more arable land in the plain, thus forcing the inhabitants to clear this land and move into the hill country. It is to be hoped that the coming field seasons will give a clearer answer to the riddle of why the settlements after the R period withdrew from the plain to the surrounding slopes." Lusoi. In 1994 excavations of the Austrian Institute under V. Mitsopoulou-Leon concentrated on the constructions on the lower terrace. She reports: "The main object was to clear the course of the walls, together with the entrances, and thereby to confirm the limits of the building, and to follow the floor level of beaten earth, to bring it into relation with the terracotta tile paving of the andron and the bath room. The area to the N of the basin and workroom was shown to be exterior, with a level belonging to the latest phase. The N wall of the bathroom extended in its first phase up to the W wall, in which originally a door opening was situated. After the bathroom ceased to function, and was joined to the Pitheion, a storage jar was put in this place. It belonged, with the three pithoi and an amphora, to the second and final building phase before the destruction of the house. The stonework in the SW comer of the workroom appears to be a foundation for some structure which no longer survives, perhaps an oven. A staircase of tile fragments set in mortar led from the bath to the feasting room and was bonded into its floor of small terracotta slabs. In the passage between the feasting room and the washroom was a setting of medium-sized stones in loam, to be thought of as a later linking. In the washroom were the remains of a second, square basin of smaller dimensions, immediately to the S of the large basin. It seems to be subsequent, its installation probably contemporary with the alterations to the bathroom area. By the NE corner of the small basin another, circular basin was preserved, sunk into the slabs of the floor. Built of the same material, it had a protruding edge with a wide channel to collect the flow of water from the floor, which in this area had a slight declivity in the direction of the basin. A further investigation of the dry wall socle in the N wall of the workroom confirmed the theory that it was actually</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 Fig. 3 against the door, of which bronze animal knobs had been found in previous years and whose opening had been found (i.e. the room was entered from the N). To the E of the general purpose room next to the andron was an upstanding rock, whose step formation led to the higher terrace. Against the rock was a wall leading in a N-S direction, uniting two sections of the rock formation. The ashlar wall coming from the W abuts this. N of the slab floor of the washroom stretches a waterproof floor level, belonging to the original building, while the slanting wall and the bath tub are known to be of later construction. The small finds confirm the chronology established in previous years. To the S of this building a wall aligned N-S and two walls attached at right angles were uncovered." Megalopolis. Ulla Kreilinge reports on work in collaboration with the Ephorate, at the stoa of Philip. Excavation of the east wing (Fig. 3) has revealed architectural elements (Fig. 4) which correct the reconstruction given by Coulton, and reveal the cross hall and a base in the inner hall. An inscription shows that this was for Xenairetos son of Kraugis. Fragmants of wall and paving N of the W exedra, at a different level, can be identified as a later habitation and industrial quarter. In the agora the uncovering of a building constructed of reused material was begun; its purpose and date are unknown. Tegea. Dr Erik 0stby, Director of the Norwegian Institute, reports on the fifth season of this collaborative project: "Work in the area N of the temple was concentrated on the pre-C levels of four 5 x 5m squares clustered around the deep trench from the Greek excavations of the 1970s. In these two successive surfaces, rich inclusions of white pebbles had been identified last season, and modest finds suggest that they were used in the 5th-6th Cts BC. Groups of post-holes from modest structures (perhaps fences or tents) appear to have been a comparatively shortlived phenomenon, probably of the late 6th and early 5th Cts, and were preceded by more substantial structures at lower levels, such as a section of a curved wall or wall socle of stone immediately N of the deep Greek trench. Somewhat closer to the temple a cluster of post holes on an Fig. 4 13</page><page sequence="14">14 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 5 almost precise E-W alignment was preceeded by a mudbrick wall, 60cm wide, on the same alignment; this is interrupted by the deep Greek trench, and it is not yet clear whether it is connected with a heap of stones, perhaps from a collapsed wall, on the same alignment W of the deep trench (Fig. 5). Underneath the layer with the mudbrick wall, which may be of early 6th Ct date, a thick layer of reddish earth with debris of a collapsed mudbrick building contains material certainly 7th Ct in date. The building had white intonaco on its walls and a tiled roof, and must have been of some importance, but it is not clear whether it was located at the place where the debris was found. In a limited trial trench in the layers under the 7th Ct layer it was possible to establish that the area had been flooded at least twice, and sediments with rich inclusions of river pebbles suggest that the floodings must have been been caused by a river passing over the area for some time, perhaps the Sarantopotomos which now crosses the plain a few kilometers away. Underneath the flood layers black earth contains coarse material of 8th Ct date, very different from the fine votive material from the same period found in the temple. Although it seems clear that the area under investigation was part of the sanctuary by the 7th Ct, it seems less certain that it was so before the floodings, which must at any rate have been an incisive event in the early history of the sanctuary. In the temple area a final effort was made this year to establish the complete shapes and dimensions of the two pre-A cult buildings. Good results were obtained for the later building, where six successive floor surfaces were identified in the pronaos and suggest a fairly long life span for the structure; much fine votive material from this part of the building is of early 7th Ct date. The transition from the pronaos to the interior of the building has left no clear traces, and may have changed shape and position through the various phases of the building. Attempts to define the front and establish the length of the earlier, smaller building were not successful, since its front seems to have disintegrated completely. Its S wall, with a structure of wattle and daub based on a wickerwork skeleton without a stone socle, was identified and studied more closely in a limited section. Fine G objects (a plate fibula, a bronze seal) were found in connection with this building. In a limited area underneath it another surface with post-holes has come to light and may be connected with a stone which has emerged underneath that platform of rough field stones which cuts up the apses of both buildings and is clearly successive to them. Function and continuity of these structures remain for the moment doubtful. A substantial amount of Myc, EH and N material is now coming up in this area, suggesting a very long history of human activity at the site. In the pronaos area continued work in the early metalworking complex showed that it was surrounded by a circular clay frame, which continues underneath the A colon- nade foundation and emerges beyond it; only a small part of this circle is accessible for excavation. Underneath the compli- cated network of clay-lined pits for the metalworking an earlier pit with black earth containing votive material (mostly pottery) of PG Lakonian type, some of it also with early Argive connotations, must probably be understood as an early votive pit carrying evidence for cult activity at the site back into at least the 9th Ct BC." LAKONIA (6th Ephorate) No report for 1988 was published in ADelt 43 Chr. Extensive repair works on monuments damaged by the 1986 earthquake is reported by the 5th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities. (ADelt 43) Ag. Petros Bay, Kalivia Skoutariou (ca. 12km SW of Gytheion). Near the N shore of this bay, in depths of 15-32m, E. Spondyles, working under the auspices of the Ephorate for Underwater Archaeology, located remains of transport amphoras of two types dating to the 1st-early 2nd Cts AD; they may represent the scattered cargo of a ship that was wrecked on this precipitous coast. (ADelt 43) Kokkinia (12km SE of Skala). J. de la Genniere reports on the 1988 results of her collaborative project with the Sparta Ephoreia in the search for the sanctuary of the Mother of the Gods at ancient Akriai. (ADelt 43) Kalamakia Cave (Areopolis, Mani). The joint French-Greek excavations at Kalamakia Cave continued for a second season under the direction of H. de Lumley and A. Darla (Fig. 6). Seven levels of pleistocene stratigraphy were established, two of which produced archaeological material. Both archaeological levels date to the MPal. Highly fragmented bone remains were found in both levels, together with worked stone. From the upper level this was MPal, but 'atypical'. The lower level material was Mousterian in character. Laconia rural sites project. The second field season of the Project (1994) was directed by Dr William Cavanagh and Dr</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 Fig. 6 Christopher Mee in August-September: "The project has developed out of the Laconia Survey and aims to investigate a diachronic range of single-period rural sites in order to ascertain their form and function through a detailed analysis of artefact distribution, geophysical prospect- ion and soil studies. Twenty sites were selected for intensive treatment, of which twelve were examined in 1993 and eight this year: LP7 = EH; LP20 = Myc; LP18 = A-EC; LP17 = C- HL; LP3 and LP15 = HL; LP12 = R; LP16 = Turko-Venetian. The methodology established in the first field season was followed once again. A grid of 5m x 5m squares was laid out on each site. Tally counts of artifacts were recorded over the whole of the site and its periphery. Then the artifacts in each square were collected. Tile was sorted into categories by glaze and thickness, weighed and discarded on site. Sherds and small finds were brought back and processed. The data have been input into the project database. The geophysical investigation of the sites was undertaken with a Geoscan FM36 Fluxgate Gradiometer. On four sites indications of features were detected and it is clear that the relationship between the geophysical data and the soil studies is of considerable interest and merits further analysis. Because of the dry soil conditions, resistivity survey proved impossible but this will form a component of the study season next spring. The procedure used for the collection of soil samples was improved this season. The samples were taken over the whole of the site grid and have been brought back to Britain for laboratory analysis. The aim is to test soil chemical and mineral magnetic characteristics as indicators of past human activity. Soil properties to be analyzed include phosphorus, a range of metallic elements, and magnetic susceptibility. Particle-size, percent organic carbon, calcium carbonate and iron oxides will also be determined. It is through the combination of these different approaches to the surface record and their interpretation by appropriate experts that we hope to gain a better understanding of these small rural sites, so frequently encountered in field surveys in Greece yet still poorly understood." Monemvasia. The fifth season of survey has been successfully completed on the upper town of Monemvasia by Dr D. Hill and Dr H. Kalligas in collaboration with Mrs A. Androulidakis, architect of the 5th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities, Sparta. The surveyors were students and ex-students of the Extra- Mural Department of the University of Manchester. Work continued on the city walls and the area of the major cisterns, but no fresh work was undertaken. There is now a considerable and continuous area of the upper town which is surveyed, levelled and has its major structures recorded both in elevation and plan, with all relevant views photographed. The opportunity was taken to broaden the photographic record of the walls, including the sea wall, and work is planned for at least two further seasons. In the area round Monemvasia E. Spondyles, working under the auspices of the Ephorate for Underwater Archaeol- ogy, located a number of archaeological remains both on shore and underwater. Ag. Paraskeve: Ligitsa (4km S of Monemvasia). On the rocky shore here, a rectangular cutting in the bedrock, 5x10 x .30-.40m in depth, and connected with the sea by a hewn groove or channel, was probably a fish-tank or perhaps a salt- pan. A little to the S of it were other cuttings too worn to be identified. 25m S of this, bedrock projecting above the sand bore a possible wheel-rut. In a heavy deposit of sand where a stream joined the sea, worn but recognizable R sherds were found; there were more on the N bank of the stream W of the asphalted road. Kremmydi (6km NE of Monemvasia). The SW inlet of this bay was explored down to the easternmost point of the S shore. At a depth of 4m a thick wall of boulders bonded with lime plaster and containing LR sherds was found. At 6m depth another wall of large unworked stones could be followed sporadically for a length of 12m; it had an average width of .8m and its orientation was SW to NE. This too had traces of lime plaster and sherds of LR pottery built in. Fragments of LR domestic vessels were also found impacted on an underwater shelf, about 50)m in extent, which was formed by the bedrock round the S shore of the inlet. Trochalia: Camping Paradise (6km SW of Monemvasia). On the undeveloped shore just S of the camp a building was visible, 20m in length with a main N-S axis; part of it was built in 'herring-bone' masonry. Cross-walls ran W from the main wall at intervals, and disappeared under a bank of earth. There were scattered sherds and in two places larger quantities of pottery flattened under stones. It may have been a PR, probably EBA site. It did not continue into the sea. (ADelt 43) Sparta. Professors G.B. Waywell and J. Wilkes report: "Theatre. Further detailed recording took place of the architecture of the theatre revealed in the excavations of 1993. This included in trench ST. 93.I the orchestra drain, the seats of honour, the lower diazoma, and the surviving benches between staircases I, II and III. In the upper survey work was completed in trenches ST.93.II and ST.93.VII. At the request of the Antiquities Service, fixed survey points were established in the area of Roman tombs a few hundred metres to the N of the acropolis hill. Work continued under the direction of S. Walker on the detailed recording of architectural blocks and other elements which now exceed 700, all of which have been photographed. Careful investigation was made of numerous Doric architec- tural fragments incorporated into both the footing and the upper walls of the surviving stage building. It seems certain that these are the remnants of the scaena frons of the earliest Augustan theatre, and detailed study of the existing walls suggests at least two later main phases of reconstruction of the scaena, dating perhaps to the Flavian and Severan periods. Excavation, recording and study of finds also continued. Limited surface clearance and excavation was carried out by a team of three workmen, to facilitate the survey and to reveal architectural elements and wall-footings. Cleaning was also undertaken in trenches ST.93.II and ST.93.VII. Two inscribed 15</page><page sequence="16">16 R. A. TOMLINSON stones were revealed, beneath one of which was a deposit of ten R coins of the 3rd-4th Ct AD. Recording was completed of the E and S-facing sections of ST.93.I, which relate to the occupation of the theatre site between ca 400 AD and ca 1300. Further study of the pottery from the mudbrick make-up of the cavea confirmed an early Augustan date for the theatre's construction (ca 30-20 BC), while analysis of the material from the post-R deposits of ST.93.1 indicated continuity of occupa- tion in some form through the 7th and 8th Cts prior to the substantial reoccupation of Sparta in the 9-10th Cts AD. The marble sculptures found in the 1993 excavations were studied and photographed for publication by G.B. Waywell and S. Walker. Roman stoa. Following on from the reports of the 1989-91 excavations on the R stoa already published or in press in BSA 88 (1993) and 89 (1994), work continued on completing the study and preparation of finds. Architectural elements and fragments of wall-painting were catalogued, photographed and drawn. Further study of residual R wares from several contexts confirmed the absence of imported wares later than ca 400 AD. It is expected that a report on all coins found in the RS and ST excavations of 1989-94 will be completed during the next year." ACHAIA (6th Ephorate) (see also Eleia, Morea Project) Aigeira. The excavations of the Austrian Institute were continued under the direction of Professor A. Bammer, who reports: "The buildings excavated in the previous year were investigated further. From this it emerges that the W building I had the same dimensions and form as naiskos D by the theatre (8.5 x 16.9m). The pronaos certainly stood on a very finely-worked limestone foundation. The cella had a floor of pebble mosaic. Building II, much worse preserved than building I, was excavated further. It must have been a peripter- os, even though the foundations of the peristasis survive only in the form of robber trenches. The cella obviously had two rows of inner supports. The length of the peripteros is not known; its width is 12.50m. Reused material was built into the foundations of the building, including an EC Doric capital. From the same period came a terracotta sima with a painted palmette frieze on the upper section, and a fragment of a relief palmette. On the W side of the hill, which is cut off to the E by the street, and where chamber tombs are found, the Byzantine buildings with upstanding walls which survive there were measured. They consist of constructions which do not stand at right angles to each other, but which follow the profile of the hill. The walls, as far as they are preserved, are covered by barrel vaults. The dating and purpose of the buildings are unknown. Given the proximity of the aqueduct, this could be a bath building, but it could also be considered to be a monastery. In the so-called agora two buildings were uncovered. In the middle was a round building or exedra, and on its north side a rectangular construction, perhaps the Bouleuterion. With the approval of the Ephorate, a track for farmers was laid out below the acropolis was planned by Austrian students. Only H and R sherds were noted along its line. The mod Grapepickers House (3), in the district Tsaoussi, was further examined. It obviously stands on an ancient foundation, reasonably enough on the orientation of the ancient buildings I and II. The wall technique was further studied." Aigion. In 1988 the restoration of the old market building was continued in order to establish an archaeological museum here. At Omagyriou Dios 10, five rooms of a R building were partially excavated. The central one had a partly-preserved mosaic floor; the square central panel had a polychrome design, perhaps of fish. Joins showed that the central panel and the four trapezoidal areas of plain white mosaic that sur- rounded it had first been made separately in a workshop. The adjoining room had a plaster floor with a circular hollow surrounded by mosaic bands; fallen on this floor were plaster sculpture wall decorations (lotus flowers, spirals, a corice) retaining traces of red colouring. A third and fourth room had remnants of plaster floors, while the fifth had a white mosaic floor with a black band round the edges; an Ott drain had been built on top of it. The building was destroyed by fire in the 2nd Ct AD. Its walls had been robbed out, possibly in the Venetian period. An ancient road to the N of the building seemed the likely ancestor of today's Omagyriou Dios. Another mosaic floor with a red, white and black geometric design was found in one of two rooms of an R building in the Roumeliote plot at Aigialeos 62. The wide border had rhomboid and chequerboard motifs, while in the centre were small shields. Ano Soudeneika (Patras). After an illegal excavation, Myc to R sherds and part of a G(?) burial pithos were noted here. (ADelt 43) Boutene: Amygdalia (7km NE of Patras). Four Myc ChTs belonging to the cemetery excavated by N. Kyparisses (PAE 1933, 92) were investigated. Tombs 1-3 had been looted or otherwise cleared. The monumental T 4, with several unusual features, was unique in the district. Altogether the four tombs produced nine burials and one cremation, 33 pots of LH IIIA- C, a Phi figurine, and many small finds, including three spearheads, two knives, bronze tweezers, a razor, a bronze fibula, hundreds of beads and a sealstone. Detailed publication was to follow the completion of the excavation of the cem- etery. (ADelt 43) Helike. S. Soter and D. Katsonopoulou report: "In order better to define the geographical range and depth of the occupation horizons in the probable area of Ancient Helike, we drilled 18 more bore holes in a series started in 1991. Of the total of 39 holes, 18 contain fragments or traces of ceramics deposited in clay, silt, or sandy soil. Sixteen of the ceramic-bearing holes define a contiguous area of about 2km2, including parts of the modem villages of Eliki, Rizomylos and Nikolaiika. This area is centered exactly at the location where Pausanias placed a village called Helike (40 stadia from Aigion), which he described as the site of the famous C city destroyed and submerged by the earthquake of 373 BC. It lies at the foot of the hill of Agios Georgios, which bears abundant ancient remains and is perhaps the acropolis of Helike. The depth of the ceramics in the bore hole cores ranges from near the surface to about 12m. Preliminary analysis of the microfauna shows that the sandy sediments between the upper and lower ceramic horizons in bore hole B-18 were deposited in a brackish (lagoonal) environment. We took samples of ceramic fragments and surrounding sediments from several cores for age determination by optoluminescence and related geophysical techniques (by Dr Yannis Liritzis, Academy of Athens). This will supplement archaeological dating of diagnostic sherds and radiocarbon dating of carbon-bearing samples (Dr Yannis Maniatis, NRC Demokritos). We will also</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 17 do further analyses of the sedimentary environments in the core samples to look for evidence of marine deposition above the lower ceramic-bearing horizon. The four holes drilled near the Kerynites River contain only river deposits of sand and gravel, with no indications of ceramics in situ, down to at least 10m depth. We therefore conclude the river has been near its present position since antiquity. On the E side of the river, however, two holes drilled in Rodia contain ceramic traces in a single horizon. This suggests a short-lived community there, perhaps belonging to ancient Keryneia. For eight days we also carried out a series of geophysical surveys, using geo-radar, electrical conductivity and magneto- metry (Prof. S. Papamarinopoulos, University of Patras). The magnetometry showed very significant results in an orchard 240m NW of the Eliki school, 12.5m above sea level. The magnetic contours show rectangular structures which look like walls, and two very strong anomalies at an apparent depth of about 2m. To investigate the magnetic features we dug three shallow hand auger holes in this area. In the first one we found a rich accumulation of tile and pottery fragments, some diagnostic of the ER period, starting at a depth of 1.2m. This continued to a depth of about 1.5m, where we hit a tile floor. In the second auger hole we again found many fragments of tile and pottery between 1.2 and 1.6m. At the bottom we found the corer of an ER wall, and black vesicular ceramic fragments of a kiln, which may account for the strength of the magnetic anomaly. The third hole was positioned over the magnetic contours of what looked like two intersecting walls. The hole yielded an accumulation of pottery fragments, and at 1.5m depth we in fact found and photographed the corer of two walls. These are the first ancient buildings to be discovered anywhere in the extensive coastal plain in this part of Greece (or between Aigion and Akrata, about 50km). The occupation horizons and substantial structures located here should be investigated by excavation." Kleitoria (anc. Kleitor). Test excavations were continued here in 1988 with funding from the Nome of Achaia. An important installation connected with the C/HL fortifications at the SW gate was located. In another part of the same general area, building remains of the R period suggested the location of both the domestic quarter and the agora. In the area of the Frankish church, evidence was forthcoming for the continuous occupa- tion of the site from the C period to the years of the Frankish domination. (ADelt 43) Mastoreika Chalandritsas. A part of a HL funerary stele from a place called Tsankobouni was handed in. The left side was missing; the right side had a Corinthian half-column supporting an epistytle on which was preserved the inscription: --] HPOKAH APAKQNOX XAIPE. On its upper surface were fittings for the placement of another architectural member, probably a pediment. (ADelt 43) Mavriki. A looted LG or A pithos burial was excavated in this known cemetery area. (ADelt 43) Neo Salmeniko. After an illicit excavation during the cutting of a country road, a rectangular apothetes (or sacred dump) came to light, which contained sherds of 4th Ct BC date, loomweights, tiles and miniature pots. The north side of this pit, which must have been connected with some shrine, was roughly-lined with unworked stones. (ADelt 43) Patras. 1988 saw the completion of alterations to the ground floor of Patras Museum. The charming main hall to the left of the entrance remained relatively unchanged, with sculpture ranged round the walls and the mosaic from Pselalonia with its themes of music and gymnastics set in the centre of the floor. On the right of the entrance was a new display of finds from the city and surrounding areas, set out in three small compart- ments arranged in chronological order: finds of 3000-800 BC from settlements, cemeteries and sanctuaries; C and HL Patras, the exhibits chiefly provided by the city's rescue excavations (the gold and silver jewellery from the city's cemeteries in cases 5 and 6 was noteworthy); R and LR finds from the rescue excavations. (ADelt 43) Also in 1988, the 6th Ephorate supervised the excavation of 316 building plots; 34 of these within the city of Patras are reported as containing antiquities (ADelt 43 Chr, 148-63). Many of them had relatively minor remains: of 19 plots which will not be otherwise mentioned, ten were R, two R and LR, three LR, one Byz and three undated. Two plots were related to the Myc settlement found at Pagonas four in 1987 (AR 1993-94, 22). Chrysobitsiou 11 had scraps of Myc walls, and Lysiou- Marankopoulou had heaps of Myc sherds and stones from the settlement's buildings. A plot at Karatza 14-Bas. Roufou was remarkable for the length of its occupation, from at least the 4th Ct BC to the present century. On its E side was a HL road, running N-S, which remained in use till the Byz period. A sewer in the centre of the road, however, was still functioning early this century, as was proved by a cement-covered drain which emptied into it. To the W of the road lay a large, probably public, HL building, which continued with various alterations through two HL and three R phases; there were also fragments of Byz walls. An area of it used in the ECh period had remains of a mosaic floor, beneath which was a hoard of 107 5th-6th Ct AD coins. Another part was utilized as a cemetery at this time. The finds from all periods of the plot were numerous and varied. A monumental entrance to the HL/R building and part of a mosaic floor belonging to it were excavated in the plot immediately to the S, Bas. Roufou 88. At the W end of a plot at Lontou 42, parts of two mutually independent rooms on the same orientation were discovered, separated by a narrow, passage-like space. Both had stone- flagged floors and walls built of large flat clay bricks and coarse yellow sandy mortar. The well-preserved N room had a handsome threshold with settings for double doors in its E wall. In the narrow central space were found fresco fragments, apparently fallen from the adjacent walls. 4.20m E of this building part of a courtyard garden was discovered. The rectangular walls surrounding it had bases for columns or statues. In its corners were semi-circular ponds joined to each other by wide channels along the sides. They were faced and floored in marble. There were slight indications that the garden had had some large central ornament. A thick destruction level covered the building in the W and above this were two later graves. At Karaiskake 212 and Kalamogdarte, a R pottery was situated on the N side of a paved road running E-W. Three circular kilns were found, preserved to the level of their firing chamber floors; two still retained the central pillar that had supported the floor. The workshop had both external and internal walls and an area where the clay was prepared was found. In the LR period a larger kiln was built over two adjacent earlier ones, making use of both their fire boxes. The arches which had supported the floor of the later firing</page><page sequence="18">18 R. A. TOMLINSON chamber, as well as part of the floor itself, were found intact. A flagged floor which covered the whole area, and a drain, were contemporary with this later kiln Two LR built circular structures were found at Antheias 206. They were surrounded by the remains of pebble floors and seemed to have been part of a workshop. In the N cemetery, part of the cemetery's road was found in Kanakare 133; it was in the E part of the plot and ran N-S. On its W verge stood a sepulchral monument. In the centre of the plot were several cist and tile graves of the usual type, with while in the W was a semi-subterranean chamber tomb which had once been vaulted. The latter, which could not be com- pletely excavated, was of columbarium type, three niches in the excavated walls each containing a clay ash urn. It dated to the 1st Ct AD; a cist tomb and a monolithic poros sarcophagus within its chamber were later additions. The funerary monu- ment was a rectangular stepped structure, 5.35 x 4.65m, with stone facing and a rubble core. A semi-circular exedra on the E side faced the cemetery road. The low seat was supported by two lions' feet and flanked by Ionic bases; other rectangular bases were at the corers of this main facade. The stone facing on the exedra was preserved to a height of 1.10m. How the monument was roofed, or whether it had a second storey, is unknown. Built into the opposite side of the monument was a small burial chamber, 1.77 x 1.05m, again of columbarium type. Its niches were found empty, but buried beneath its floor a lead ash ur was found in the foundation core of the monu- ment. On the basis of architectural detail, the monument was dated to the 1st Ct AD. It was dismantled to be erected elsewhere. A plot at Poukbil (Pouqueville) 25-27, which lay at some distance from the cemetery road, contained an unusual and unorganized part of the N cemetery. Tombs dating C to ER were packed in successive strata. Pit graves, cist graves with Corinthian tiles and one with limestone slabs, and tile graves with Laconian tiles were found. Twenty-two clay ash urns and one of lead were also excavated. These were usually in rectangular pits covered by, and sometimes lined with, flat clay slabs. Twelve shallow pits, similarly covered, contained burnt bones and grave goods. Funerary offerings were unusually rich and impressive: wreaths of coloured and gilded clay flowers, clay figurines and pots, bronze and gold coins, gold jewellery, fragments of silver, bronze mirrors and other small items, and egg shells. Poros architectural members and parts of a funerary stele with a pedimental roof were also found. Four poor R tile graves in the Kyprou-Doiranes (58th Primary School) plot also belonged to the N Cemetery. In the S cemetery, the 68 LR-ECh tombs excavated at Mesolongiou 11 were a continuation of the cemetery already known from plots at Mesolongiou 7 and 9 (ADelt 32). The tombs were cists with built walls, usually in groups, and tile graves using Laconian-type tiles. Almost all were on an E-W orientation, and only a few contained grave goods, usually poor. A pair of gold earrings, two silver pins and a silver cosmetic tool were exceptional. The SW cemetery road ran N- S through the centre of a plot at Ben. Roufou 71. Only one tomb, a sarcophagus, was found. It contained two burials which were not contemporary. Neither had any offerings, A workshop was later built over the area. A plot at D. Ypselantou 57 and Basileiadou contained three destroyed tile graves and part of a built cist. A small wire ring and a glass paste bead were the only finds. At Aktes Dymaion 21 a LR chamber tomb and parts of three others were investigated. Altogether ten cist tombs were excavated; all were looted except one. Tests below the chamber floors brought to light five earlier tile graves and the remains of six ash urns. In the E cemetery, a plot at Patron-Klaus 1 produced four R ChTs on a common axis, and part of a room of a later building of unknown use. Twelve burials were excavated: six built cists and six tile graves. Offerings were poor and few. Four ash urns were also found. A plot at Kalabrytou 69 contained one wall of a R funerary peribolos. Before being taken over by an extension of the E cemetery, the University's plot at Patron-Klaus 3 had contained a group of six wine presses, adding to the growing evidence that wine-making was an important industry in ancient, as in modern Patras (ADelt 29). The wine presses were in use from the end of the 1st Ct BC to the beginning of the 2nd Ct AD. There were three treading floors with collection tanks, one collection tank without a treading floor, and two treading floors without collection tanks. Each press was divided from the others by walls built of river pebbles and mud, while a similar wall enclosed the whole group. On the N side of the group was part of a storage area with the lower part of a pithos in situ. The wine presses were abandoned when the E cemetery of Patras needed to be extended in the 2nd Ct AD. The tombs were mostly tile graves (16), plus a cist grave with walls of flat bricks, and a rectangular pit grave with stone slab covers. Each grave contained a single skeleton except for T 13 (two adults) and T 14 (a female and two children). The poor grave goods consisted of lamps, pots, loomweights, and, in the mouths of male skeletons only, bronze coins. T 8 was an exception, containing a gold pendant with an embossed Aphrodite, a gold earring with a green stone, a glass vessel with a skilfully- worked vertical handle, and a gold bead. There were also three ash urns. The cemetery had to be abandoned when it was flooded by a torrent in the 3rd Ct AD. Above its remains was founded a building of unknown use and date. The only extant Turkish bath house in the city was located in the commercial quarter and may be one of those mentioned by Celebi in the 17th Ct. This hamam, on Boukaoure St., is still in use, but was unknown to archaeologists because of the modern facade now covering the entrance. Extensive restora- tion work has been approved. (ADelt 43) A 6th-Ct mosaic floor of an ECh basilica was located on Kanakari St. Architectural members found included a double colonnete with its capital, and a threshold with hinge sockets. A further section of the well-known floor mosaic of the 'deaconess Agrippiane' was uncovered on Ermou St. (ADelt 43) Paulokastro. (200m from the Patras-Kato Achaia highway.) During the excavation of a country road, three tile graves and a built cist were destroyed. There were no funerary offerings, but surface finds suggested a late C-HL date. (ADelt 43) Petropo. A G pithos burial was destroyed during the excava- tion of a road here. (ADelt 43) Prebedos. (New Patras-Tripolis road, 4th section, near the chapel of the Panagia). Five rooms of a LR-ECh building were excavated. Two earlier architectural phases were recognized in lower levels, the earliest being HL. The remains may have been connected with ancient Pharai. (ADelt 43) Probodos. (S of Agia Kyriake, E of the Aigio-Salmeniko road, on land belonging to Eirene Katte.) After illicit excavations, a trial trench uncovered remains of three tile graves without offerings. In the area up to the chapel of Agia Kyriake and also on the hill opposite the Aigio-Salmeniko road, many sherds and also roof tiles were visible, probably indicating a settle-</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 19 ment. The sherds belonged to the C, HL, R and Byz periods. (ADelt 43) Rakita (Ano Mazaraki, Patras). After three excavation seasons during which the apothetes of the sanctuary was excavated, in 1988 the excavation was extended to the S. This brought to light a row of eleven sandstone bases for wooden columns and part of a stone-built wall founded in a G stratum. The wall and the bases probably belonged to the temple of the sanctuary. (ADelt 43) Riolo: Katarrachia. Stone blocks and unworked stones from a HL(?) building were dragged to the surface during ploughing on the land of Bas. Papageorgopoulos in 1988. The blocks, 1.35 x .85 -.55m, of cream poros, appeared to have come from an extensive public building. C, HL and also MH and LH sherds were found in the vicinity. (ADelt 34) Sarabali. A rectangular, single-roomed HL building was found .2m beneath the cultivated surface. It was built of stone quarried on the spot, had an entrance in the N wall and remains of a stone-flagged floor. Sherds were mainly from undecorated domestic pottery. (ADelt 43) Sigouni, Kalabryta: Borous. A semi-circular wall of unworked stones associated with a floor of tile fragments set on edge existed here in 1988. 100m to the NE was the corer of a building of semi-dressed limestone. Such walls were known earlier on the SE of Tsouka hill. A bronze male statuette was also found at the locality called Skala, according to local inhabitants. All this area was strewn with flat bricks and roof tiles, but there was no surface pottery whatsoever. The area is close to ancient Lousoi and may have been a settlement connected with it. (ADelt 43) Stavrochori: Xerokampos. During excavation for the con- struction of new abattoirs here in 1988, remains of a MH settlement were found. The site, a low hill beside the Peiro river, was very heavily eroded, so that only the last traces remained. An exception was a small circular building set in a cutting in the bedrock. It contained poor, semi-coarse domestic pottery, but also sherds of grey, yellow and Argive Minyan. Adjacent areas had remains of HL and other periods. (ADelt 43) AITOLIA-AKARNANIA (6th Ephorate) Ampelaki: Ariada. (10km NE of Amphilochia.) In the localities known as Kastri and Liba, the remains of cist tombs were investigated. They belonged to an ancient cemetery which was probably looted in its entirety. (ADelt 43) Amphilochia. In 1988, in connection with the project on the stabilization of the walls of ?anc. Limnaia, small trial trenches were excavated in several places on the fortification wall and also by the walls of public buildings, both in order to obtain dating material and to ascertain the condition of the subsoil. (ADelt 43) Kechrinia. (7km SE of Amphilochia.) Near the ancient acropolis in the locality known as Belegriniatsa, three cist tombs were discovered and investigated during work on the Kechrinia-Lepenou road. They were on a N-S orientation and had been looted. (ADelt 43) Loutraki: Amparia. (8km W of Amphilochia.) A Myc tholos tomb was located on the land of Ap. Souliote. It had apparent- ly come to light during the earlier construction of a country road. The built entrance of the tomb was visible and bore signs of attemped illicit excavation. Myc and pre-Myc sherds were collected from all around the tomb, and it was believed that a settlement of these periods, until then unknown, existed here, it would be the only one in the Ambracian Gulf district. (ADelt 43) Loutro: Balomatia. (10km NNE of Amphilochia.) A cist belonging to the W cemetery of Amphilochian Argos was found here. Like others adjacent to it, it was on a N-S orienta- tion, and had been looted (ADelt 43) Nea Pleurona. A gang of six antiquities thieves, including a police officer, made an extraordinarily impudent but unsuccess- ful attempt to rob part of the W cemetery of the ancient site of New Pleuron. They opened a cist grave, but abandoned it, believing it to be empty, and also attacked an adjacent peribol- os. The cist grave (2.15 x 1.45 x 1.20m, oriented N-S) con- tained .15m of fill, which concealed three tear flasks, a bronze aryballos, two lamps, a bronze coin, some gold dust and a very well-preserved bronze strigil. Although the funerary peribolos escaped the depredations of the present-day thieves, it had not been so fortunate in the past. In it were two subterranean built chamber tombs with couches, and three cist graves of the usual type; they were to be further investigated in 1989. (ADelt 43) Naupaktos. Rescue excavations within the town in 1988 continued to provide information about the ancient city's fortifications. A plot at Leoforos Athinon-Th. Noba contained an 8.50m stretch of the wall, 2.90m wide, running N-S. The foundations were preserved, and one course built in trapezoidal pseudo-isodomic masonry. The central fill, of stone chips set in mud, was strengthened at regular intervals by cross walls within the wall, linking the two faces. On the W side of the wall, near its N preserved end within the plot, a narrower wall joined it at right-angles; this may have formed part of a gate. A drain with a settling tank which ran N-S about 4m W of the fortification wall was contemporary with it, and further north may have run through it. Part of a road was also found. This section of the city wall lay further E than any of its other excavated remains except one. In the 3rd Ct AD the area was a cemetery, and continued in use until the LByz period, as is proved by drains of that date which ran over the remains of the wall. Another length of the city wall was found in the plot of E. Raikou at the junction of Kapoudele and Karakoulake. Its visible length was 13.50m, its width was 3.20m and it was preserved to a height of 1.40m (two courses). It was again in trapezoidal pseudo-isodomic masonry. Along its E face ran an open, stone-built gutter which sloped from N to S. Towards the S end of the wall, a drain ran through it at right-angles, and emptied into the gutter. The fill of the wall was virtually non- existent because a R bath had been built over it, and three of the latter's niches, two semi-circular and one rectangular, were preserved on top of it. In the E part of the plot, the corner of a large, probably public EHL building was discovered. When the R baths went out of use, the area was taken over as a Ch cemetery with successive graves situated in and on the niches, while roughly-built walls occurred at a still higher level. The probable reason for the final desertion of the area was a conflagration, signs of which were found in the N niche of the baths and to the E of the W wall of the large HL building. Building remains were found in two plots. At Tzabella 111,</page><page sequence="20">20 R. A. TOMLINSON a LR wall which ran E-W and described a N-facing semi- circular niche at its E end was found. Beneath it was part of a rectangular HL building with remnants of a mosaic floor. Within the LR niche were constructions of a much later period and also a built tomb. At Pharmake and Tzabella, buildings of two phases were found. To the earlier, LC-HL, phase belonged parts of one or perhaps two dwellings with narrow walls of stones and mud, and, where preserved, floors of pebbles and yellowish plaster; most of the rooms seemed to have been storage areas. A long stretch of a rectangular-sectioned covered clay drain lay to the N of these walls. The second phase, also HL, consisted of part of a large building founded on top of the earlier one with walls of roughly-dressed stone 1.2-1.4m wide; its purpose was uncertain. In the SW corer of the plot was a R cist tomb. Antiquities were found near two unnamed roads in the Naupaktos area. In the E part of Dem. Altanopoulos' plot (O.T. 130) remains of some walls and fragments of a mosaic floor belonging to an EHL building were found. There was a destruction level of tiles of the Sicilian type. Part of a drain made out of Corinthian-type roof tiles was also discovered. In the SW of the plot part of a rectangular R cistern was excavated. Its walls were built of spolia, and in its E wall had been set a threshold block which had served as an overspill. (ADelt 43) During excavation connected with the water supply in the Megalomata locality a section of an ancient built drain came to light. N of this were two walls belonging to a building that was probably LR. (ADelt 43) With funding from the Nome of Aitoloakamania a system- atic excavation was begun at Skala Naupaktias, in the place known as Dragatsoula, 3km N of the town. (ADelt 43) Petroto (Eparchias Trichonidas). Deep ploughing on the land of Chr. Petros hit the foundations of an ancient settlement dating from the end of the A to the LC periods. The walls were totally destroyed, and the rescue operations which followed recovered only a few loomweights and potsherds. (ADelt 43) Stratos. In the SW corer of the Kakos plot two cists, oriented N-S, were discovered. The first had bones from two disturbed burials and four pots, of which an oinochoe and a lamp were unbroken. The second contained four burials without grave goods. Both tombs were of limestone from nearby Lepenou, and both dated to the 3rd Ct BC. During the excavation of a bothros in the plot of G. Bekos, the district's head guard, another cist tomb was encountered, again oriented N-S and built of Lepenou limestone slabs. It contained two burials, with heads to the S. The rich funerary offerings dated mid 4th-mid 2nd Cts BC. Amongst them were a skyphos, two amphoras, six tear flasks, three lamps, a plate, part of a pyxis, three kotylai, a bronze mirror, leaves from a gold wreath, two kantharoi, a kyathos, an aryballos, a silver coin etc. (ADelt 43) Thermon. I. Papapostolou (AS) continued excavations which revealed that the mound of earth, 60cm high, was above the remains of the PR paving which had been found in other places in and outside Megaron B, at a depth varying between 1.23 and 1.45m. Megaron B had been built above this paving. If the paving was used as the first floor of Megaron B-which is by no means certain-then the mound and Megaron B existed together, at least during the first period of the Megaron. Later the tomb was covered, and a hard floor was trodden over it and around the stele. The level at which this floor is found corre- sponds to the floor of burned clay with ash which was found in 1993 in the SE corer of the Megaron. It also corresponds to the succession of floors in the rear building found in 1992. It belongs, therefore to the more recent period of Megaron B, when sacrifices were performed at least at the front of its exterior. At that time the mound in front of its S side was not visible, and only the stele projected 23cm above the floor. The excavation was extended to the S to a narrow area of deposit untouched by the earlier excavations, between the end of the E wall of the cella and the S stylobate of the temple. In the middle of a deeper stratum, below the S edge of the mound, a pit was uncovered surrounded by irregular slabs 50cm deep and 23cm square. Around it was a black deposit, a fragment of a jug with geometric decoration of the EIA, and traces of carbonized wood, perhaps from a post which was held upright by the small stones placed at the bottom of the pit. Immediately to the S was found another built pit-like construction, more recent than the previous example, 60cm deep and 45 x 37-27cm. It contained black earth, the iron tip of a spear, a few bones of small animals and sherds. It was edged with irregular slabs to N and E. Between these two assuredly sacrificial pits, and especially to the S side of the mound, at a depth of 1.17m, are slabs and hard earth. These perhaps belong to the floor used round the mound. To the E of the more recent pit, along the SE comer of the temple of Apollo, were found two circular structures, 80cm in diameter, built from small slabs in four or five courses. They are at the same level as the mound, on the surround of which are traces of fire, bones of small animals, and framents of pottery. These excavations will be continued. So that the phases of Megaron B can be equated with periods of use of the floors in its interior, together with the deposits between it and the succeeding building, new excava- tions were conducted along the E wall of the Megaron and below the E wall of the naos of the temple, from the 5th to the 7th bases of the exterior colonnade. The new excavation revealed the remains of the PR paving, at a depth of 1.23m, as well as the layer of packed earth which constitutes the floor used with the building, at a depth of 69-71cm. It also revealed that the upper level, on which the walls of the naos stand, has everwhere a layer of ash which contains bones and the remains of pyres. It conforms certainly to the upper black level which the earlier excavators attested below the walls of the temple, without implying that this level covered the whole of Megaron B. It follows that this level was formed after the destruction of Megaron B. The excavation also revealed fully the preserved section of the rubble wall F, which according to Rhomaios separated a deep anteroom from the main room of the Megar- on. At the corer of this wall to the E, in the deposit on which the Megaron was built, were found sherds with blackened geometric decoration. This type of pottery belongs to the EIA and it is a valuable, if broad, chronological horizon for the construction of Megaron B. KEPHALLENIA (6th Ephorate) Eastern Kephalonia. Professor Randsborg of the University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with Dr Lazaros Kolonas, conducted the third and final survey and measuring campaign. The 1994 campaign concentrated on finishing the plan of the city of Same. During the survey campaign more R finds came to light in the NE part of the island. During the three years' work, 350 sites were studied, among which 150 contained architectural remains. Finds of the MPal and N periods were abundant, mainly along the coast. Myc sherds were registered,</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 but the amount was not impressive. Few sherds dated to the G period. Architecture and other finds from the A and C periods were important and abundant. Imports from Athens and Corinth are characteristic for the earlier periods. Finds from the late HL period are relatively few while the R and L antique periods are well represented, as are finds from Med and Venetian times. Ithake. The press report that excavations at Stavros have produced a paved area 20 x 20m, defined by walls, whose function is as yet uncertain. A cist grave contains a cremation burial which yielded a coin of the Achaean League dated 165- 150 BC. At Pelikata, three new trenches produced PR hand made pottery, stone tools, etc. In 1988 work concentrated on the protection of archae- ological sites. The study for the roofing of the renowned mosaic of the R villa at Skala was completed, and the Myc cemeteries at Mazarakata and Metaxata were fenced. ELEIA (7th Ephorate) Agia Triada. (Agios Ioannes or Palioboukoubina, Panopoulou.) During cleaning operations in an illicitly excavated Myc ChT here, sherds of the latest Myc and EG periods were collected. (ADelt 43) Barda. Six ancient marbles were handed over to the Ephorate by the police department at Barda, after being seized in the Strophila forest; no other details of their background are known. They include part of a sarcophagus garland, a table leg in the form of a caryatid, the headless upper part of a female form of Athena type, a rather battered head of Dionysos, a female statuette with its left hand missing, and another, possibly of Artemis, with the head and both arms missing. (ADelt 43) Kyllene: Pharos, Kaukalida islet. At least two R tile graves had been destroyed here, and plentiful pottery of the period was in evidence, plus pithos sherds, coarse wares, and also grooved ECh sherds. Obsidian and flint tools indicate a much earlier occupation of the islet, which in the distant past would have been joined to the mainland. (ADelt 43) Ladiko, Olympia. (Xespithati, NE of Ladiko, now officially Kallikomo.) Part of a Keftiu cup, sherds of a LH I single- handled cup decorated in ripple pattern and other remains from a destroyed Myc tomb were handed in. (ADelt 43) Morea Project. The fourth season of the Minnesota Morea project took place in August 1994; F. Cooper and J. Alchermes (ASCS) report: "The Trimble Global Positioning System (GPS) continued to be a major asset which greatly expedited the mapping of villages. One team concentrated on inhabited or more recently abandoned villages and towns. In total, 931 houses in 53 villages and towns were mapped and drawn. The other team worked on remote Frankish citadel towns, including the mapping and recording of building walls at Sandomeri, Kastro Kastelli and Kastro Leontio. The latter three sites amounted to 224 houses dating from the Frankish period to the time of abandonment in the 18th and 19th Cts. The older section of Zaharo was the training site this year. We then moved to S Elis and surveyed Phigalia. We spent the remainder of the 1994 season in Achaia, where we mapped and recorded buidings in the following villages: Ano Kleitoria, Ano Vlassia, Kato Vlassia, Aroania, Agios Nikolaos, Dehouni, Dessinon, Demestiha, Dragogi, Drosato, Glastra, Kalousi, Kalanistra, Kalanos, Kangadi, Karousi, Kastria, Katarraktis, Kato Kastelli, Paleo Kastelli, Kato Lousi, Korphe, Kouteli, Krioneri, Lakkomata, Leontio, Kastro Leontio, (Paleo) Likour- ia, Livartsi, Lousika, Manesi, Mavro Mandila, Megalos Pontias, Mirali, Mitopolis, Neo Kombigadi, (Paleo) Kombigadi, Paos, Petsaki, Phamelitika, Phigalia, Platanos, Plataniotissa, Platano- vrisi, Prasidaki, Prophitis Elias, Spartenou, Valta and Vessini. In addition to recording domestic architecture, we recorded seven abandoned mills at Dehouni, Kato Kastelli, Kastria, Leontio, Likouria, and Paleo Kombigadi; a complex of granaries and threshing floors at Krioneri; a complex of 43 kalybia used for storing maize at Likouria; an abandoned hani near Katsolieti; an abandoned 19th Ct cheese factory near Kalavrita; and the remains of a round tower at Skepasto. The following villages, which are listed in the Venetian censuses, were examined and eliminated as having too few (in some cases, no) surviving pre-beton houses: Agios Blasias, Agridi, Anastasis, Ano Psophis, Chrisopigi, Dafni, Kameniani, Kato Hovoli, Kleitore, Kleitoria, Nasia, Pefkos, Philia, Phlam- boura, Plaka, Pteri, Selka, Skepasto, Skotani, and Trekio. Several abandoned or nearly abandoned old towns remain in a good state of preservation due to metoikesis. These include: Dehouni, Kouteli, Paos, Vassini, and Kastro Kastelli, a Frankish settlement where we recorded more than 30 houses, a cistern and a church. Of even more historical significance, many people appear to be concerned with maintaining the integrity of older buildings. We noted evidence of this aware- ness in the value of preserving and restoring older buildings, for example, in Kato Lousi, Lakkomata, and from the owners of the still functioning hotel at Aroania. The paucity of old stone buildings in many of the towns just listed, as well as in the villages surveyed, results from their devastation during World War II by the occupying forces. In many cases the owners heroically rebuilt and patched up their residences under the impossible conditions of the times. Usually the repairs altered the original character of the house. Nevertheless, we recorded a selection of these houses for their important historical value. Three towns were mapped but not catalogued this year: Linistaina, Lalyvia and Elaiohorio. The important discovery of abandoned Frankish citadels has lead to further understanding about the origins and chronology of the tower houses in the Morea. Few houses continuously occupied in this region date prior to the 18th Ct. This leaves a gap of several centuries between Frankish foundations and the later towns. Nonetheless, using sites such as Akova, Kastro tis Oreias, Kastro Portes, Sandomeri and Kato Kastelli a few observations may be made, with the understanding that they are tentative in nature. House walls at abandoned Frankish settlements stand to various heights, for instance one to two storeys as at the aforementioned Kastros or to nearly full height as at Akova. Examination of details and their topographic setting within the surrounding terrain of terraces allows for a clear reconstruction of the Frankish house type. These tower houses were nearly square in plan 4 x 5m on a side, and rose three to four floors in height. The lowest floor served as a barn, having its own side door. The household main floor comes at the third level. Access to the entrance doorway is across a breach made by separating a landing on a built terrace and the facade wall of the house by several feet. A cross-way of planking could be drawn up, making the breach moat-like for increased security. The second and fourth storeys were accessible from within, through trap doors and by ladders. With the Greek war of 21</page><page sequence="22">22 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 7 Independence, the staircase moves forward to abut the house and the fourth floor disappears from the design. In standing houses, a later generation usually lopped off the top floor and lowered the roof, as was done recently at Demestika. More- over, the post-independence houses increased the dimensions of the floor plan to 12 x 6m. However, major components to the house design carry through the medieval to the pre-beton period. This season we noted more garden walls with impressive gate entrances. These tend to appear by village and are not evenly distributed over the region. We either became more aware of them because a student team member is working on a project related to Greek garden walls, or there are indeed more of these enclosures in E Achaia than in other areas we surveyed in past seasons. We encountered more date stones and architectural sculpture this season, but this comes, in part, as a result of recordi in 1994 more than twice the number of villages recorded in any previous season." Neochori, Kyllene. (Loutro, ca 6kms E of the Castle of Chlemoutsi.) An intact pithos burial was discovered in this known cemetery area. The pithos (1.95 long, max. dia. 1.25m) lay on its side with its mouth closed by a round clay lid held in place by a stone; it also had a specially-constructed neck support. It contained two adult skeletons, accompanied by two ovoid 'Eleian' lekythoi, two bg bowls, a skyphoid kylix, two clay tear flasks of an early type, a clay bobbin, and a bronze mirror, plus the remains of a gilded bronze diadem with 60 gilded clay pellets, probably representing myrtle berries, part of a bronze needle, fragments of at least two pins, and two silver oboloi from Eleia and Boiotia. The finds date to the 2nd- 3rd quarters of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 43) Olympia. Under the direction of H. Kyrieleis (DAI) a final excavation was conducted in the area of the Pelopion. By the C propylon four new levels were investigated. The finds made here, beneath a level in which a complete series of G bronze animals had previously been found, came entirely from second- ary fluvial deposits from debris in the N part of the sanctuary. This confirms observations made in the area of the Prytaneion, that still in the 7th Ct the Kladeos, at least when it overflowed, reached up to the Gaion and the Pelopion hill, and by this the SW part of the PR tumulus was damaged. No stratigraphic evidence was obtained for the dating of the Propylon, but observation of building style shows that the gate was not erected in the 4th Ct, but rather can be attributed to the great EC new building programme. In connection with the research project on Olympia in the R imperial period, U. Sinn began the investigation of the imperial structures in the SW area. The objects of the excava- tion were again the so-called SW building and the small bath complex (the so-called Baths of the Leonidaion) immediately to the N. With the results of this campaign the picture of late Olympia became clearer. It had been established previously that the sanctuary must have remained in good condition into the 4th Ct AD. The work of 1994 brought two additional points in support of this. The first was the remarkable dis- covery of an inscribed bronze plaque (Fig. 7) giving the names of successful heavy and light athletes from Asia Minor and the Greek mainland. Among these are many Athenians as well as several inhabitants of Boiotian Thespiai. The time of their victories falls in a broad span from the 1st Ct BC to the late 4th Ct AD; the last entry belongs to the 291st Olympiad. The plaque was cut even in antiquity, and is therefore only fragmentarily preserved (dimensions 70 x 40cm); its inscribing was successive, and not in chronological order. Form and context of the inscription suggest that the names of members of an athlete guild were recorded on it, so it provides a closer insight into the festivals held in the 4th Ct AD. Until now the list of Olympic victors (at least hypothetically dateable) ended with the 264th Olympiad (= AD 277). There were only two other names, as completely isolated later additions: Philomenes of Philadelphia and the Armenian prince Varazdates, both dated to the 287th Olympiad (AD 369). The exotic origin of these last names is held by many scholars to indicate that for the Greeks the cult festival of Zeus had lost its significance. The new inscription supports an entirely different view. J. Ebert will publish this plaque. The plaque was found inside the so-called SW building. It supports the theory, previously put forward on the strength of its architectural form, that this building must have been the</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 club-house of such a guild. From the inner decoration of this club house two richly ornamented geison bl'ocks were found (Fig. 8). They do not approach the level of work in the city of Rome itself, nor is the ornament comparable with Roman decorative form. The block is obviously the work of a local Peloponnesian workshop, as is demonstrated by the wilful mixing of stylistic forms of the late Republican, Augustan and Flavian periods. The study of the building ornament is being undertaken by M. Mathea-Fortsch. The second of the finds which are significant for the late history of Olympia comes from the bath area N of the club house. This is being investigated, together with the other baths at Olympia, by G. Landstatter. The building, insignificant on the outside, demonstrates that aesthetically and technically it is of the highest level. Particularly worthy of note is the tech- nique of the wall heating, which consists of a closed system of vertical tubiform heating ducts built close to each other in the wall structure (Fig. 9). The wealth of the complex is demon- strated also by the floor mosaics, of which small sections were uncovered. The undertaking of such a structure was not foreseeable, but it shows that at the end of the 3rd Ct AD the sanctuary, widely demolished for the fortifications, nevertheless could again be provided with a suitable infrastructure. If around 300 AD such an impressive 'hygiene station' couldbe added to a wider bath complex, it speaks for a more active life in the sanctuary at this time. Once more the theory of a direct or indirect Herul destruction of Olympia comes into question. In connection with this research project A. Martin is working on the pottery of the imperial period. 'In a special study he has established that the inhabitants of the late Antique settlement, built in the 5th and 6th Cts in the area of the former sanctuary, relied mostly on imported pottery. Note- worthy is the wide distribution of its origin; the inhabitants at the foot of the Hill of Kronos made use of Aegean wine amphoras, African and Syrian oil amphoras, African lamps as well as African and Asia Minor fine wares. The late Antique settlement of the former sanctuary was firmly tied within the net of commercial contacts of the period, and so was not merely a makeshift settlement in the ruins of the lost place of cult. The clearance work conducted in the excavated area, under the direction of K. Herrmann, concentrated this year on the area of the Bouleuterion. H. van de Locht did his concluding study of this building complex, clearing the area of the N building of the remains of destroyed buildings. As a result, he discovered a series of adjustments for the geison. He was also able to carry out a small architectural probe at the paved area. Parallel to this he sought the remains of the destroyed Ionic porch. Architecturally, this provided information that it belonged to the oldest building in Olympia. In conclusion, further cleaning work was carried out on the so-called Kladeos river wall. For J. Knauss this provided further confirmation that this great building work is not an embankment for a fortifica- tion but a dyke, established in antiquity, which protected the land to the E in time of flood. In the Museum, the Nike of Paionios is once more on display. MESSENIA (7th Ephorate) Aristomenes: Trane-Sykia. During road improvements the chamber of a Myc ChT was almost totally destroyed and covered with earth; from it came a damaged belly-handled amphora with LH IIIC (early?) decoration. (ADelt 43) Fig. 8 Chora Trifylias: Palace of Nestor, Ano Englianos. The site guard I. Rokanas found and handed in a curious clay object. Its dimensions were 12.5 x 27.8 x 23.8cm. It was fashioned by hand and had three amygdaloid surfaces, each of which bore a Linear B sign; it was pierced lengthwise. (ADelt 43) Gargalianoi: Tymbos tou Kanalou. (Ca 2km WSW of Gargalianoi, and ca 1.5km S of the Gargalianoi-Marathoupolis Fig. 9 23</page><page sequence="24">24 R. A. TOMLINSON road.) This once extensive tumulus appeared in 1988 as two small hillocks, and in the S part of it a cist tomb cut into the poros bedrock was destroyed during work on a privately-owned plot. The tomb contained an extended burial, without grave goods. Signs that there had once been two or three other graves in the same area were noted, and sherds, chiefly MBA and LBA, but also including some HL and Ch, were collected. Remains of worked flint and a C building were visible on the S hillock, but the Kanalos spring on its S slopes was very overgrown and difficult to locate. On the N part of the hill a large sherd from a Keftiu cup with ripple decoration was found on the surface in a place where there had been much erosion from rain water, resulting in the washing down of a consider- able quantity of MH and LH pottery, including LH IIIA kylikes. The site's apparently long history of occupation and its slow but steady erosion made its excavation desirable. Messene. P. Themelis continued excavations for the AS. He uncovered completely the fountain house in the NE corer of the agora, identified as the fountain of Arsinoe. A study of the remains showed that it was built during the 3rd Ct BC, when it consisted of a courtyard with basins at the back, clearly reservoirs. The facade was a Doric colonnade, with a support wall behind with engaged Ionic half columns carrying a frieze. In the time of Augustus the reservoirs were enlarged, the destroyed Doric facade was restored with a screen, and the rear reservoir was embellished with an exedra on which was placed a collection of bronze statues. The usefulness of the fountain and its important position were the reasons why in imperial times two monopteral buildings were added at the ends, presumably to house dedications. To the E of the Asklepieion part of a settlement was found, dating from the 5th to the 7th Ct AD. This extends also to the Asklepeion and S of the agora. Carvings were found in the walls of the houses, mostly work of the sculptor Demophon, as well as inscriptions. An interesting find from the area of the Asklepeion, set up at the crossroads, was a triple Hekataion dedicated to Artemis in the 3rd Ct BC. With the completion of the excavation of the sanctuary of Demeter, the Messenian Hero and the Dioskouroi, we can see that it was founded in the A period, having as its focus the cult building which in the 4th Ct BC became a temple, with a forestructure for the cult of other gods. The sanctuary was renewed in the time of Augustus. The excavation brought to light significant finds which shed light on the cult of Demeter and the Dioskouroi. There are examples of the Messenian Hero as a hoplite as well as a cavalryman. From the second period of the sanctuary comes a bronze shield with a dedicatory inscription to Polydeukes. In the court of the Asklepeion a cult building was found in 1994, the successive building phases of which date from G to A; to C; and to HL. At the beginning of the 2nd Ct BC, the building was abandoned and destroyed and replaced by the Asklepeion. From the cult building comes a quantity of antiquities which were found in a depository: terracotta figurines and relief plaques, as of the sanctuary of Demeter, and also larger plaques. One of these represents a chthonian hero on a throne with sceptre and kantharos, and the usual snake. Another plaque shows again the hero on a throne and in front upright worshippers, a man and a woman. From the similarity to the bronze limbs or parts of the body which were found in the depository, together with a bronze eye, a terracotta foot and hand, it appears that the deities worshipped were healers, hero and heroine, and the mythical Messenian king and doctor Asklepios. On the evidence of Pausanias, a building S of the Asklepei- on, 50m wide and of unknown length, was identified as the Hierothusian. In 1994 four building complexes were uncovered, separated in areas of unknown purpose. The NW complex is a large peristyle with a hearth in the middle. E and N of the peristyle court are halls whose walls carried painted decoration. Pylos. The fifth season of the Minnesota Pylos project took place in 1994 under F. Cooper and M. Nelson (ASCS). They report: "As in previous years, our purpose was to clear the area of backfill in order to create a state plan of the walls; earth was removed down to the lowest course of stone or to the level reached by the original excavators. The season was devoted to clearing and re-examination of the aqueduct which spreads across the acropolis from the main building to the NE gate, and of the area behind, or NW of, the main building. The aqueduct stretches across the length of the acropolis, starting at the NE gate and meandering from a true course on its way to the cluster of water mains at the NE flank of the main building. We commenced in 1994 with 5m trenches adjacent to the set of 1993. These fell within a pair excavated by Marian Rawson in 1958. A second pair of trenches were laid across and within the bounds of 1958 trenches MY2 and MY7. The two sets of trenches helped to establish the path of the aqueduct. We then proceeded to clean the overlying backfill, moving diagonally across our excavation grid system to the NE. Only at the SW and NE extremities and at a few spots between did we have the opportunity to clean to the bottom of the watercourse. As Blegen determined, the bottom of the channel rises in both directions to a maximum height (elev. +193.039) at a distance of 66m from courtyard 42. A preserved length of terracotta pressure pipe, in situ within the exterior wall of court 42, represents the preserved furthermost end of the watermain. The base of this pipe (elev. +193.03) and the opposite or NE extremity (elev. +193.18) of the aqueduct, just at a point where it drops through the NE gate, are comparable in elevation but below the highpoint. In addition, the 1994 elevation readings show that the bottom of the water main runs level (within 5mm) between the pressure pipe in the wall of court 42 (elev. +193.034) and a larax (elev. +193.039) embedded within and at the bottom of the aqueduct some 28m to the NE. In connection with the waterflow, several preliminary observations are worth advancing at this time. The terracotta pipe appears to be conical, having the shape of a pressure pipe. This design has a narrower or nozzle end which makes a tight insertion into the wider joint end of the next pipe in line. This reduces or eliminates leakage of water that flows full through the pipe. The assembly of pipe follows the flow of the water in the direction of the nozzle end. In the present case, the lay of the pipe in the wall of court 42 indicates that the water flow was meant to go from court 42 towards the NE and area 101. In other words, in the opposite direction to that formerly supposed. Blegen correctly noted "Throughout its length the aqueduct shows many signs of reconstruction and repair." Blegen confines this activity to the period of the palace, but it prob- ably continued through a much longer period: G, HL, and Med. Near the top of the slope just above the NE gate, the water main forks into several branches as it wends its way down- wards through the NE gate. The central branch contained pottery of the aforementioned post-Myc periods. Further investigation in 1995 and analysis may resolve some of these</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 questions. A single trench was laid within the SW building. The purpose was to determine the amount of backfill and the extent of unrecorded architectural detail in this area of the acropolis as a guide to estimate the work area for the 1995 season. In the palace NW area, except for the rectangular set of foundations for circular structure 87, few, if any, of the approximately 40 walls here were cojoined by the original excavators to form a coherent structure: the published, as well as the working, plan of this area is rendered as a schema of walls. Papathanasopoulos's notebooks also include a few scarp drawings of soil depositions, invaluable for stratigraphic analysis of ceramic sequences but less useful when it comes to an evaluation of architectural stratigraphy. Indeed, the maze of walls presents a bewildering crazy quilt even to the most tutored of observers. The plans and elevations of the 1994 season go some way in making sense of inter-relationships and a relative chronology." The Pylos Regional Archaeological Project completed its third season under the auspices of the ASCS. Professor J. Davis, the Director, reports: "Approximately 10 km2 were intensively surveyed. Three teams operated daily for most of the season: the first in and around the village of Margeli, the second in the highlands between Gargalianoi and Lefki, and the third in a coastal transect just S of the Langoubardos River valley. From time to time the directors and other members of the project revisited and/or restudied sites already known in our larger survey area. Finally all teams participated in gridded collection of an area of some 8ha on the Englianos ridge SW of the Palace of Nestor, on either side of the asphalt road from Chora to Pylos. Several new sites were discovered in the Langouvardos/- Valta area; in addition, we were able to define the spatial extent and chronological significance of three University of Minnesota sites: Gargalianoi Ordines, Koutsouveri Agia Sophia, and Valta Kastraki. Work at Ordines was particularly rewarding and revealed that the site has had a long and complex occupational history, beginning already in the N; its size is also much larger (ca 6ha) than previous estimates by the University of Minnesota. Investigations of the rugged uplands between Gargalianoi and Lefki produced two new archaeologi- cal sites and many interesting individual finds. Artifacts collected included plentiful examples of chipped stone, apparently denser here than in other areas we have examined; these seem to have been fashioned on the spot from locally available cobbles of chert. Some may be of Pal date, but others are more obviously of N or EBA types. One unusually dense concentration of lithics was associated with a few small pieces of EBA pottery. Aside from lithic finds, the discovery of a sherd of Pg or G date is of special interest. In the area of the village of Margeli intensive survey located the remains of six new sites, one perhaps a R cemetery. In areas round the Palace of Nestor, the gridded collection of surface artifacts was completed this year, and focused on the areas SW of the palace where, in addition to plentiful finds of PR pottery, our teams recovered many fragments of plaster, several with painted decoration. Magnetic prospection focused on two areas, the area of the lower town trenches dug by Blegen W of the palace, and a terrace further NW. Investiga- tions this year have demonstrated that substantial remains of large structures are preserved in this part of the site. The archaeological strata on this part of the ridge, however, are being rapidly destroyed by cultivation and erosion. Geoarchaeological fieldwork attemted to determine the nature of the alluvial plain SW of the dilapidated villa on the Kokkevis estate at Romanou. The goal was to determine if the plain represents a silted up basin which may have been filled with water in the BA. With the aid of a professional well drilling team, four holes were drilled to depths of 16-18m in a straight N-S line across the plain, each separated from the next by 80m. The plain is approximately 225 x 350m, roughly rectangular in shape and unusually level on the surface. The stratigraphy provides unequivocal evidence for the existence of a basin in this area. The flat bottom of the basin and other evidence suggests that the basin was artificially constructed. In addition to these investigations soils were mapped and expo- sures of buried soils studied at Boulka, at Dialiskari, and on the Englianos ridge. Geophysical prospections were conducted at three sites: Bouka, Dialiskari and the Englianos ridge. Work at Dialiskari was least successful (although we did succeed in completing a map of all standing monuments, with the aid of a total station). There we had hoped to trace the remains of a R bath, part of the hypocaust of which is visible in a terrace scarp, and perhaps also to explore the foundations of a R house to which a still visible mosaic belongs. In the event, however, metal vine-stakes and other impediments made magnetic prospection difficult or impossible in several critical fields and no certain architectural remains were found in the areas where it was possible to conduct investigations. In contrast, research at Bouka produced very promising results, including the remains of what appears to be a large building (at least 60m in one dimension). Pottery from the site collected last year is almost exclusively of late HL and ER date and we presume that the building also belongs to that period." KERKYRA AND THESPROTIA (8th Ephorate) In 1988 the Ephorate mounted two exhibitions on its work in Kerkyra and Thesprotia. The Kerkyra exhibition 'Five Years of Research in Kerkyra through Plans and Photographs, 1983- 1988' was held in the Kerkyra Demotic Theatre, and consisted of four display groups: PE Kerkyra from Pal to LBA; C and HL Kerkyra, with sub-sections on the harbour, the artisans' quarter, housing and daily life, and cemeteries; R Kerkyra; and 'chance finds'. The most important exhibits in this last category were two bronze statues of the 2nd and 1st Cts BC, representing Herakles and a young shepherd. The Thesprotia exhibition, held in the primary school at Igoumenitsa and entitled 'The Work of the 8th Ephorate in the None of Thes- protia 1986-1987' showed photographs and plans of rescue excavations in four ancient cemeteries and planned excavations at Gitane, Elea and Pyrgos. KERKYRA Acharabe. Tribyza Plot: N and EBA sherds and two groups of bones were found mixed with fallen stones; to the SE of these was a cobbled path. (ADelt 43) Kerkyra: town. In Garitsa, the cemetery area of the ancient city (AR 1993-94, 31) the excavation of a building plot at Kyprou 7 uncovered four cist graves of tiles, two pit graves, two burial pithoi, the base of a stone sarcophagus, fifteen funerary vases and three large pyre areas. The pit and tile graves, much disturbed, had apparently contained inhumations. The partial remains of the two pithoi were in a waterlogged stratum of sand; one retained a few scraps of bone. The sarcophagus base contained pieces of a glass tear flask. The 25</page><page sequence="26">26 R. A. TOMLINSON funerary vases were chiefly small pithoi used for child-burials, and amphoras, a hydria and a bg krater dating to the beginning of the 6th Ct BC. The vases had been used as ash-urns, imperfectly-cremated bone being found in some. The only ash- um containing a funerary offering was T 6, which had a rhomboid-shaped gilded bronze brooch. Two noteworthy finds from general strata were a gilded bronze ring and a kylix base with MENANAPOZ inscribed on it in late archaic lettering. The three pyre areas may once have been defined by clay structures with walling ca 10cm thick; scraps of this were found throughout the excavation. This part of the ancient cemetery had suffered badly both from inimical environmental conditions, and from later building activity, well-digging and a modem tile-factory. In the Figareto area, identified as the artisans' quarter of the ancient town referred to by Thucydides, the Mikalef plot produced an eighth kiln, which still retained part of its pierced clay floor supported on a small pillar. A long wall with an entrance in the SE of the plot may have been part of a peribolos surrounding the kiln area. In the NW of the plot, NW of kiln 6, a HL building was discovered which was probably one of several constructed in the area after the kilns went out of use. The great quantities of sherds found throughout the excavation were mostly from amphoras, the chief product of the kilns. Other types of pots dating to the A-HL periods, A and HL figurine fragments and numerous bronze coins were also found. The coins had a date range of 450-100 BC and came from the local mint, and, inter alia, Macedonia, the Roman Rebublic, Syracuse, Dyrrachium, Corinth and Epirus. In the Kasphike plot in the Palaiopolis area, a second season of the co-operative excavation being conducted by the Ephor and Professor T. Hackens of the University of Louvain La Neuve, Belgium, and his colleagues, showed that the first season's LR tile floor was part of a R bath building. Parts of the hypocaust, a room with a mosaic floor, an apsidal frigidar- ium with marble facing, a room with a plaster floor, several other areas and some drains have been uncovered. The bath complex is thought to have been founded during the LR period (330 AD) and to have remained in use until 675 AD. (ADelt 43) Sphakera. Michalake Plot: part of a HL building, probably a country house, was discovered. Its plan apparently consisted of two wings, each comprising a row of rooms, divided by a passage which ran the length of the building. The third room from the N in the E wing had a floor of fine gravel set in plaster, laid over a foundation of cobbles. This may have been an internal courtyard. The room opposite it in the incompletely- excavated W wing contained a large storage area. The small quantity of pottery found included a lekythos of 325-300 BC and a late 4th Ct BC lamp. Nine local bronze coins found had a date range of 450-229 BC. Agricultural tools and architec- tural fragments such as bits of columns and a Doric capital, were also found. (ADelt 43) THESPROTIA Elea Paramythias. This LC walled settlement, situated E of Beliane village, on a spacious terrace on the slopes of Mt. Korila, is identified as ancient Elea, capital of Eleatida, on the basis of inscriptions and its bronze coins, which were limited in number and circulation. The 1,550m-long fortification wall of the site was built in polygonal masonry on a foundation course of massive orthostats. The main entrance was in the SW; a gate on the E side with a monolithic lintel is note- worthy. A cleaning and restoration programme included limited excavation of two of the standing monuments in the theatre area. Building A, a long, narrow building (40.4 x 8.5m) with a central row of rectangular pillar bases, was probably a stoa, built in polygonal masonry. Finds from it included LC and HL sherds, complete pots and lamps, a bronze ring and eleven bronze coins plus a Kerkyrean silver one. Building B (18x14 m) had E and W wings, each consisting of a single row of rooms, divided by a wide passage running the length of the building. Six large storage pithoi were found in the N room of the E wing. The equivalent room in the W wing contained a low gamma-shaped structure of unworked stones, perhaps a kind of bench. The main entrance was in the N, but there was also a small entrance to the E wing in the S wall. The floor, composed of fine gravel, was apparently destroyed by fire. From the excavation of the building came bg and plain sherds, also complete pots including perfume flasks, lamps, lagynoi and lekythoi dating to the 4th Ct BC, tools, a spear head, and coins from Ambracia, Epirus and Kerkyra as well as ancient Elea itself. There was also a coin of Alexander the Great. (ADelt 43) Parapotamos: Tsifliki. A cemetery in a small tumulus (height 5m) was discovered S of Mt. Doulka, 200m S of the bank of the River Kalamas, when it was illicitly excavated with a mechanical excavator in 1986. The systematic excavation which followed brought to light 88 tombs, of which 80 were cists, seven were pit graves and one was a pot burial. Almost all the tombs were on an E-W orientation. Only a few had grave goods. Amongst these were a pair of HL gold spiral earrings, bronze coins of 989 AD, and gold, silver and bronze post-Byz jewellery. Pottery was almost entirely absent: only a few sherds and a complete but unpainted HL jug were found. On the basis of the finds, the cemetery appears to have been in use from the HL up to and including the post-Byz periods. (ADelt 43) Pyrgos Ragiou. In recent years a number of projects have been undertaken in the interior of this fortification, which guarded the settlement of the Kerkyrean Peraia from the NE in the area S of Kalamas. Cleaning, restoration and test excavation began as early as 1978. The polygonal enceinte was built in both isodomic and polygonal masonry styles. The published plan shows four towers to the NW, N, NE and SE approximately. The wide main entrance was in the S, and there was a small gate immediately E of the N tower. On the remains of this ancient tower was founded a fine 19th Ct. Tower house (the 'Aga's tower') which still stands to roof height. A study for its restoration has been prepared. A huge outcrop of bedrock was incorporated into the west part of the fortification wall; on its inner side there was a spring which flowed into a large cistern. During extensive clearing in the north half of the enceinte, six buildings, all probably Ott, were cleaned and planned. Tests made beneath another Ott building situated in the internal angle of the NW tower showed that its stone flagged floor rested on a fill containing C and HL bg and plain sherds. Beneath this, two small gamma-shaped structures were found in a test just north of the spring, and PR pottery was encountered. A large area in the south of the enceinte was excavated to bedrock. Six buildings and some drains and various unrelated wall fragments were found. While no date could be given for any of these individually, the excavated area generally pro- duced coins of the C, HL and R periods, the majority from Kerkyra; C and HL sherds and lamps; fragments of A and HL</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 Fig. 10 figurines; and many iron arrow-heads and lead sling-bullets. Once again, particularly in the south entrance area, lower strata contained PR sherds and also stone tools, mostly of flint. A test on the exterior of the northern section of the fortifications revealed a HL proteichisma. (ADelt 43) BOIOTIA (9th Ephorate) No report for prehistoric and Classical antiquities in 1988 is published in ADelt 43. Akraiphia and the Ptoion. Christel Muller reports the resump- tion of work by the French School, originally begun by M. Holleaux in 1885: "The new programme of research is based on an overall strategy of study of the sanctuaries linked to that of the territory of Akraiphia. Archaeological analysis will be linked to geographical and geomorphological analysis to permit the reconstruction of a convincing image of the occupation of the Fig. 11 land, and the variations of economic activity, heavily influ- enced by the proximity of Lake Copais. The proposal is to work outwards in concentric circles starting at the acropolis and extending to the frontiers of the territory. The first season had three objectives: to establish the topographical network necessary for the improvement of the general archaeological map, and the detailed entries; to retrace the monuments already known, particularly those entered on the archaeological map sketched by P. Guillon in 1943; and to obtain a first impression of the land use in antiquity by means of geomorphological observation. The necessary survey systems, including the bases for survey by Global Positioning System (GPS) were established. At the acropolis of Akraiphia observation on aerial photographs, and the identification of the remains of walls on the ground made it possible to form an exact picture of the line of the ramparts for almost their complete extent (Figs. 10, 11, 12). It was without doubt included within the layout of the lower city, as was the agora also, therefore, located at a terraace wall on the platform of the church of Agios Georgios. Different phases of construction are clearly visible. Several remains of buildings are visible on the plateau as well as on the ancient terraces situated on the N slopes (houses, temple, barracks?). Investigation of the geography revealed three types of land: the limestone mountain chain, reaching a height of 700m, formed of extensive karst surfaces; a dry but cultivable region at the foot or on the slopes of this; and finally a lacustrine or semilacustrine region (Lakes Copais, Yliki and Paralimni), drained in antiquity by the employment of a series of artificial emissaries using the katvothra, and above all of dykes shutting off the inner parts of the bays. The cemeteries of the bays, according to the area where they are situated, are good indicators of the level of the lake and the condition of the dykes. Unfortunately, they are almost all invisible nowadays, thanks to the disruptions caused by the construction of the national highway. 27</page><page sequence="28">28 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 12 An essential part of the work consisted in the determination of the possible frontiers of the region. Failing detailed written information, three types of 'monuments' permit this: a bound- ary marker on Cape Pthelia, the sanctuary of Apollo itself, and the defensive fortlets situated at various points in the territory. The boundary marker of Cape Pthelia, known since the 19th Ct, established the frontier between Akraiphia and Kopai at the end of the 4th Ct BC. Its presence, at the foot of the cape, proves the existence of disputed agricultuaral territory, no doubt the small pocket of land between Mytikas and Pthelia. In all likelihood, the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios marks the E frontier of the city of Akraiphia. It is the fortlets which best indicate the contours of the City, even if they cannot all be dated with precision. The towers of Megalovouno (Fig. 13) and Tsekourieli which defend the route from the N are still visible. Of the fortifications which are less dateable, some of those marked on Guillon's map have been recovered (Pelagia, a rocky point above the Ptoion), others have not (Vathy Spithari, Kori), while others have been observed for the first time (Philies, Summit of Mytikas). The location of these forts marks out a coherent territory which corresponds to the natural boundaries already observed. This collection of monuments does not, assuredly, mark the frontiers in the modern sense, establishing a definitive line. It is clear that the actual bound- aries are only imposed as a result of territorial disputes in certain precise locations. The absence of any access to the sea for Akraiphia is confirmed." Akraiphnio. Excavations around the church of Ag. Georgios located three burials with grave goods including LR coins, a fibula (?), a Byz ring, a metal shoe heel, a two-pronged pitchfork, pottery of the 12-13th Ct and a copper coin of Romanos IV (1068-1071). (ADelt 43) Tanagra. A Med tower, possibly Frankish, preserved to a height of 5 m was identified lkm N-W of Tanagra. (ADelt 43) Thebes. The press report that excavations in Pelopidas St. have uncovered a corner of what may be the archive room of the Myc palace. Several linear B tablets have been found. Excavations in the town continued with workshops, coins (anc., MByz and Frankish) and pottery encountered on Kassandrou St. Two unidentified lead seals were found, one dated to the 11th Ct. Work on the town sewage network uncovered Byz remains, including houses, burials, tombs (one, on Pindarou St., contained a coin of Nikephoros III [1078-1081]), part of a sculptured templon epistyle, architectural members, and an anonymous class K follis of 1085-92. (ADelt 43) Fig. 13</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 PHOKIS (10th Ephorate) Ag. Nikolaos Phokidas: Kaboulinitsa Bay. (Ca 2km S of the ferry terminal for Aegion.) In 1988 E. Spondyles investigated this area, under the auspices of the Ephorate for Underwater Archaeology. Building foundations were to be seen on the shore in the NW part of the bay, some showing signs of a destruction level. A small building, probably R, was of bricks and tiles bonded with pink waterproof plaster. 10m to the SE, another building of unworked stones and strong lime plaster, ca 5 x 5m, was discernible. The NW half of the bay, including the island of Glaronisi to the W, had an underwater shelf, at a depth of 3m, on which walls could be discerned. On Glaronisi a thick scatter of LR pottery was noted. In the SE part of the bay a sandy bottom 6m below the sea surface extended about 100m from the shore, then dropped suddenly to 25m, forming an underwater gorge bounded on the NW side by the shelf which included Glaronisi island. Here groups of transport amphoras were found, all but one of the same type, indicating a R shipwreck. In the same area were two mod. (turn of the century) anchors with four flukes, and a length of chain impacted on the rock-but because of the size of its links this was unlikely to have belonged to the anchors. (ADelt 43 Chr, 685-7) Ag. Pantes: Bidabe Bay. (8km SW of Galaxidi.) In 1988, E. Spondyles, working under the auspices of the Ephorate of Underwater Archaeology, explored the W inlet of this bay on which the seaside extension of the village of Ag. Pantes is situated. A structure of unworked stones 3-10m wide was found at a depth of 1-3m, parallel to the S shore of the inlet and extending along the whole of its length, so that it formed a kind of underwater parapet. Beside it, at depths varying from 6 to 13m, but never more than 20m from the shore, were found sherds and larger sections of pots, mostly R transport amphoras but also smaller vessels and a piece of roof tile. The stone structure was probably a rough jetty in the only part of the bay sheltered from the S winds. This is all the more likely if the village of Ag. Pantes (formerly Bidabe), about 1km inland, has been correctly identified as the anc. Tolophon of Pausanias. There are many signs of anc. habitation in the seaside settle- ment of the village. (ADelt 43) Galaxidi: Anemokampi Bay. (1.5km S of Galaxidi.) E. Spondyles, under the auspices of the Ephorate of Underwater Archaeology, examined this bay in 1988. In its S inlet, Steno, R sherds were found; they were particularly numerous in the S, innermost end of the inlet, and in the sea to the S and SE of the Nesaki peninsula, where walls could be seen .5-lm below the sea surface. At the bottom of the S-SE slopes of the peninsula, already identified as a PR site, HL and R sherds were observed. In the centre of the inlet was a moder wreck, which had been previously located by the Ephorate. It showed signs of fire, and according to local tradition, it was a wooden vessel sunk during an air raid in 1940. On the E side of the entrance to the Steno inlet, under the NW promontary of Cape Trachilos, a Y-shaped iron anchor was found at a depth of 22m, firmly fixed to the rock on which it lay by sea organisms. It has two 1 th Ct AD parallels at Serce Liman in Turkey and Ag. Ioannes Theologos in Phthiotis. Near the anchor, half-sunk in sand, were remains of transport amphoras, mostly of spherical form with combed-ware decoration. They were comparable with EByz amphoras from Halieis and two local unpublished examples in the Galaxidi museum. Another type of amphora near the anchor had a fusiform body. There was not sufficient evidence to suggest that the anchor and the amphoras were from a shipwreck, but if future research, perhaps by underwater excavation, should prove the anchor and the amphoras to be connected, the Y-shaped Anemokampi anchor would be the earliest one of its type known. Two almost intact EH amphoras in the Galaxidi museum are said to have come from this bay. (ADelt 43) Itea: Evangelistria. In 1988, under the auspices of the Ephorate of Underwater Archaeology, E. Spondyles studied the harbour area at Itea and observed that the mod. (early 20th Ct) quay was founded on an older structure. This was clearest at the W end, in the Evangelistria locality, where the quay was worn away. Below it was a wall ca im wide, made of unworked stones and strong lime plaster. In its broken upper surface, at intervals of about im, were channels left by wooden beams which had passed through the wall during its construc- tion. In two places also were the remains of rectangular emplacements 20 x 10 x 3cm deep, showing where vertical beams had been set into the walls. This technique has been known in the construction of harbour works since antiquity, e.g. at anc. Anthedon. W of this anc. wall, exactly opposite the factory 'Kylindromyloi Iteas-Alexandres', walls were noted under the water. (ADelt 43) Nea Koukoura. E. Chalkia reports traces of an ECh basilica (parts of the synthronon and other architectural remains) found during investigation of the Damos plot, where building excavations had previously revealed a mosaic floor. (ADelt 43) Stenos Desfinas: Baltos Bay or Bay of Stenos. (14km S of Arachova.) In 1988, E. Spondyles, working for the Ephorate for Underwater Archaeology, investigated the W, S and part of the E coasts of the Tsimplias headland. On the tip of the head- land and slightly to the SE there was an extended reef covered by shallow water. On the edge of this, at 12m depth, there were remains of R transport amphoras impacted on the rock. Although there were no finds on the sandy bottom at 25m depth, the remains may be an indication of an anc. shipwreck on the reef. (ADelt 43) EUBOEA (1 th Ephorate) Eretria. The work of the Swiss School continued in 1994. The exploration of the summit plateau of the acropolis, begun in 1993 under the direction of P. Friedmann (University of Lausanne) was continued in 1994. Nothing was found to confirm or disprove the presence, suspected in 1993, of an HL sanctuary, because of the erosion of the surface levels. Only a collection of walls can be attached to the HL occupation of the acropolis these are reduced to their foundations and placed on the same alignments as the large terrace cut in the rock to the W, but still at the summit. In contrast, levels of PR occupation have appeared in two large soundings, one to the W of the terrace, the other to the S. The pottery extends from final N to the end of MH. A LH IIIC bowl, almost intact (Fig. 14), bears witness in addition to Myc occupation, attested previously by a few sherds in the soundings along the E and W line of the rampart. The S sounding in particular has produced interesting architectural traces of the MH period: several contiguous elements of habitation (the position of the trench does not permit any understanding of their exact relationship), one of which has a floor covered with a white stucco, and two small cists containing burials of infants or newly born children, without furnishings (Fig. 15). Along the summit plateau, a 29</page><page sequence="30">30 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 14 Fig. 16 Fig. 15 structure covered with plaster for more than a metre, running E-W, could have functioned at the same time as a support wall and as a fortification. In the N gymnasium E. Mango (University of Zurich) conducted excavations intended to define the plan and the construction phases of this building. The results confirmed certain elements revealed by the American excavations at the end of the 19th Ct, but which have been buried since then, such as the beginning of the portico which extends to the W of the building. In the room situated at the NW comer, and in the triangular space to the N of 'tholos' G, a channel orientated NW-SE was uncovered, a part of which had been discovered further to the E in 1993. Since the 'tholos' G cuts into its line, it dates before the construction of the gymnasium, and should have served to supply water to the areas situated to the S of this zone. A stele was found here bearing the name AIHAXI- O. In the same area, a second channel orientated N-S was superimposed over the first. It was made of slabs of terracotta coming from the paving of 'tholos' G, broken and assembled to form a U-shaped channel (Fig. 16). Since the excavation was not extended to the S, we do not know its destination. In the narrow space situated immediately to the E of the 'tholos' a deep cutting in the rock was found, 40cm wide, a cutting for the wall or floor of a channel. To the E of the washrooms B/C a small elongated room (LO) was found, probably a service room, in the N of which a tomb made from tiles was inserted at a late period. To the E of this was a second washroom (Fig. 17). Its walls and floor were covered with mortar, and oval basins, cut in large rectangular blocks of stone, were placed one after another to form an L. In addition, a bench ran along the walls. A channel coming from room C supplied them with water. Numerous fragments of tiles found in the fill of this room proved that it was roofed, as was a second room which appears just to the S of it. In the division which separates the two, traces of a hearth suggest an installa- tion for heating water. Perhaps this ensemble corresponds to the baths constructed along the E side of the gymnasium in the imperial period. The geophysicist P. Gex (University of Lausanne) made systematic measurments of resistivity in the region of the gymnasium. The results confirm the supposed line of the main E-W road S of the theatre and the gymnasium and N of the House with the Mosaics. Also, the soundings made N of the theatre show that the limestone subsoil dips progressively under the mass of earth against which that building was constructed, confirming that it does in fact comprise an artificial hill.</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 31 Fig. 17 K. Reber (University of Basle) did supplementary research in the W quarter, thus exploring this zone in terms of the C and HL periods. Study of material found by various excavators continued in the Museum of Eretria. Among this, bones found in a votive deposit N of the temple of Apollo were examined by J. Studer and I. Velarde (Museum of Natural History, Geneva). The results show a considerable difference between the use of the area in the G and A periods. Almost all the bones of the first period were fragmented and belong to the forelegs of ovi- caprines, while those of the second period were from a wide variety of animals. Spathari. Investigation of the church of Archangelos Gabriel indicate an 11th Ct date for the original structure, possibly inscribed-cross in plan; today the ruins of a three-aisled basilica stand on the site. The dating is based on sculptural decoration, some pieces in situ, others re-used in the masonry of a later building phase. (ADelt 43) Lefkandi (Toumba). The four-week season of excavation in March and April was under the direction of M.R. Popham and I.S. Lemos, with R. Tyler. In what was projected as the final season in the current operations on the site, the two main aims were the definition of the extent of the cemetery and the completion of the restoration of the PG building. Progress on restoration was prevented by the lack of an approved plan for the central cover over the burials. In the attempt to find the boundaries of the burial ground, the area S of the building, investigated in 1993, was extended some 7m to E and W, and a further 2m to the S. In addition, a small region thought earlier to be the E boundary of the cemetery, E of the building and of tomb 40, was reinvestigated, and the earlier conclusions confirmed. However, a previously undetected tomb (76), lacking in offerings, was discovered underlying and partly cut by tomb 40. In the E extension, four pyres were uncovered as well as three tombs, of which only one (78), contained offerings. Among these were four vases including an Attic EGII/MGI oenochoe, gold attachments and a large gourd-shaped bronze vessel, apparently unique. In the W extension, an area some 5 metres square was investigated to the W of and along the presumed line of the roadway, without any burials being detected. However, on the E side, two tombs and three pyres were found, the tombs being among the most outstanding in the burial ground. Of these, tomb 80, one of the largest so far discovered, had its offerings largely intact and in position, under its immense cover slabs. This female burial had been given 49 vases heaped in two piles at either end of the shaft. Though somewhat repetitive, their range was considerable, including large local pyxides, pedestal- led goblets, shallow bowls with double handles, small standed cooking pots and pendent-semicircle skyphoi. With them were two Attic late EG II imports, a skyphos and a pyxis. Among the rich jewellery with the burial was a unique ring consisting of a large oval bezel, embossed, with a looped band, reminis- cent of the attachments found in several tombs. Tomb 79 was unparalleled in the cemetery in comprising a shaft with a niche dug into one side at the bottom, which held the burial, a cremation contained in a bronze cauldron with a lid. With it had been deposited a killed iron sword, spearhead and a bunch of arrowheads as well as a bronze grater. The shaft had been filled with the remains of a pyre containing two fragmentary Phoenician flasks and fragments of three Cypriot flasks, together with an engraved north Syrian cylinder seal, a BA antique. This type of burial, a cremation placed in a bronze cauldron with associated weapons, could well be an earlier precedent for those at the West Gate in Eretria. The E and W limits of the burial ground were reasonably firmly established, and while it clearly extends S of the excavated area-for how much remains uncertain. Even so, it is likely that some 80% of the cemetery has been uncovered. Phylla Fort, Euboea; Joint Survey. A joint Greek-British topographical and preliminary architectural survey was carried out from 12th to 23rd September of the ancient fort at 'Vra- kos', Phylla in Euboea, first brought to notice by G.A. Papa- vasiliou in 1903 (EA 1903, 131-4 with uncontoured plan). In collaboration with the Ephor of Euboea, Mrs E. Sakellarakis, the survey was made by Dr J.J. Coulton, assisted by Miss E. Hatzakis with Mr M.R. Popham as director on the British side. A contoured plan of the site is now in course of preparation. Surface sherds unexpectedly indicated occupation of the hill in EH times as well as some presence in the Med stage, which could well imply differing dates for the surrounding fortification walls, though the 'barrack' block, roofed with Corinthian tiles, appears to be C. Sherds of this period in its vicinity included one with a fragmentary painted inscription of four letters, apparently Attic. It is hoped to complete the architectural plan in 1995, combined with excavation of the barracks to ascertain more securely its date and possible purpose.</page><page sequence="32">32 R. A. TOMLINSON NORTHWEST GREECE (12th Ephorate) Actium. W. Murray (ASCS) reports on the second season of the cooperative project with the Ephorate of Underwater Archaeology: "This year the project focused on two tasks, the continu- ation of the sidescan sonar survey into the central region of the battle zone, and the visual examination of the most promising sonar targets with a video equipped Remotely Operated Vehicle or ROV (underwater robot). Sidescan sonar survey. In 1994 we continued our search into the central region of the battle zone using the same base map, grid system, survey routine and positioning system as last year. This year, however, we substituted a sidescan radar with a higher degree of resolution (330 Khz vs 107 Khz) in order to achieve sharper pictures with more detail. The sonar was recorded on digital audio tape and then translated into com- puter files (we used the PCX format) for digital enhancement by computer. Six days were devoted to the sidescan survey this year, during which time we completed an additional 14km2 of the battle zone (representing a linear distance of 135km). A preliminary analysis of this sonar record revealed at least four new targets, or 'areas of targets' in the newly surveyed region. We have now surveyed approximately 46% of the battle zone (46 of 100km2). Examination of sonar targets. At the conclusion of last year's season, we selected 22 targets for further examination. This year, we revisited these targets during the first two days of the survey and selected eight as 'primary targets' suitable for examination with the ROV. Adding the four from this year's search, we had a total of 12, seven of which were explored during the six days devoted to this. For four days we received the assistance of the Hellenic Navy Hydrographic Service which donated the use of the research vessel Naftilos. We thank Mr Arsenis, the Minister of Defence, and Admirals Stangas and Maratos for their generous assistance to the project in this regard. In order to examine these targets we utilized a Phantom 500 ROV owned by the department of Marine Science at the University of South Florida. Once we selected a target for study and determined the precise position we returned to it with the aid of our DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) satellite receiver. Once there we marked the spot with a weighted buoy, and then anchored the research vessel as close to this buoy as possible. We next lowered the ROV carefully to the bottom and manoeuvred it towards the target. In order to find the target more easily we utilized a small scanning sonar which operated like an underwater radar. Mounted on the front of the ROV, the sonar allowed us to 'see' the target up to 90m away so that we could aproach close enough to acquire it visually, usually at a range of 8-10m. Throughout this process the video output of the robot's camera was recorded on 8mm video casettes. With the exception of one small target that we were unable to locate, every target was defined, at least in part, by rocky masses protruding through the sandy sediments of the sea floor. Near one of these rocky outcrops (Target 136.1) we located three interesting artifacts: two ovoid stones about 12.5cm in maximum diameter, and a large curved object with a flattened 'upper' surface (that is, 'upper' in its present orientation). The objects are located about 3.5km off the Preveza peninsula in 57m of water. The two ovoid stones lie some 10-15m apart, are not covered by bottom sediments and are uniformly smooth, which may account, in part, for the lack of marine growth on their surfaces. Comparison of one stone with grooves left in the sand next to it by the ROV's frame reveals its diameter as 12.5cm. Considering the depth and distance from the shore, these stones are surely intrusive, brought here by some human event. Is it a coincidence that these stones are the size and shape of projectiles hurled ny naval petroboloi of the HL and R periods? The large curved object lies some 5-10m from these stones. By chance the weights of our marker buoy landed directly beside it and allowed us to calculate its size as 1.15m long and 45cm high. Its curved profile and flattened upper surface indicate that it is man made, an impression that is reinforced by the texture of its surface which looks like oxydized metal. It lies next to a small rock mass in a position that obscures its shape and size where it meets the sea floor. At present we cannot say whether it represents debris from the battle or from some other event." Arta. A previously unrecorded small keep (6.60 x 4.50m) known as Top-Alti was identified near the national highway, 2km away from the old Arta bridge. The walls (2m thick) of this square structure survive to some 10m at the NE corer, where a smaller tower was added at a later date. Each corer seems to have consisted of a square tower. No indications are provided as to its date (Ott ?). (ADelt 43) Extensive investigation took place of the buildings associ- ated with Faik Pasha, one of the earliest Ott governors of the region after the conquest of 1444. The 15th Ct mosque- complex of Faik Pasha is located on the W bank of the Arachthos river, and is a typical example of an early Ott mosque (square, with a portico along the main entrance). The latter was demolished in 1930, and attempts were made in 1987 to gather Byz and Ott architectural and sculptural members from the site. Despite the existence of the former and literary evidence for a Byz monastery on the site, no evidence was found for a previous Byz building. A square structure with no entrance located north of the mosque-complex was evident- ly an Ott tomb, although apparently of a later date. 150m from the latter, the traces of an Ott hamam were located, preserved up to the springing of the arches. Thus it would appear that the complex associated with the mosque appears to be that described in the will (vakfiye) of the Pasha himself, dated to 1493 and preserved in the archives in Ankara. The complex provides a valuable addition to our knowledge of the Ott period in the area. (ADelt 43) Remains of a Byz road and buildings were uncovered on the Kostadema site, on Kommenou St. Four phases of the road were encountered, the deepest 3.86m below the present surface level. All four were constructed with small stones and pebbles, compressed earth, sand and brick fragments, above which a fine layer of sand mixed with brick chippings was applied. The road may be that mentioned in a letter of the Patriarch Jeremiah in the 16th Ct. The fill between the road phases consisted of black earth, ash and clay fill. An undated building (9.30m wide) made of unworked stones and ancient spolia was located on the E edge of the road, and traces of the earlier road phases existed below this structure, suggesting that the road (3m wide now) had once been broader. Classical remains were found to the NW of the plot, at a depth of 4.2m, 22 copper coins have yet to be identified. (ADelt 43) An important LByz structure was located at the Taxos- Muller site, also on Kommenou St. and some 50m from the Kostadema site. The road on that site must have passed E of this rectangular secular structure, which measures 8.50 x 10m in its present state and was divided into two compartments, one slightly larger than the other. Walls included ancient spolia and are preserved up to a metre high. Hearth, entrance and a small</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 conch in the NW corer were located. Finds included 130 bronze coins, most unidentified as yet (1987) but some bearing the name of Theodore Doukas, Despot of Epirus (1215-30). Sherds of plain and glazed ware were found, along with some ripple ware. Amongst other finds (rings, fibulae etc.) was a fine Byz censer consisting of a shallow bowl with crenelated rim and an elliptical cover with a long handle. The corer of a smaller, roughly built structure was located 3.20 m from the SE corer of the first house. The excavation provides valuable information on secular buildings of the period of the Despotate and helps to establish the as yet unlocated boundaries of the Byz city. (ADelt 43) Nikopolis project (AR 1993-94, 36-38). J. Wiseman (ASCS) reports: "The principal aims of 1994, the final season of field work scheduled for the project, were to complete the study of the changing coastlines throughout antiquity; to study the geomor- phology of the principal sites; to complete the survey sample of different environmental zones; to sample more extensively and intensively the lower valley of the Acheron river and the Ag. Thomas peninsula; and to conduct a limited amount of urban survey. Geological prospection and topographic survey, as in previous seasons, form an integral part of the planned archaeological and geological investigations. Acheron River Valley (excluding Kastri). The survey plan for the lower Acheron valley focused on the foothills, ridges and mountains that surround the lower valley, and on the elevations within the valley, since most of the- lower-lying areas had been searched in 1993 or had been ruled unnecessary for survey for geological reasons. Survey units were therefore grouped in the following three areas: Areas S of the Acheron river: Alonaki, Tsouknida, Pountas. Perhaps the most significant site surveyed in this area in 1994, because of the range of human activity represented, was at the Koumasaki promontory, S of Ormos Odysseos in the Alonaki region. The site has proved to be much larger than estimated when it was designated 92-24 two years ago. Both the upper Pal and the N are represented among the lithic material recovered, including a N arrowhead. During the M and LBA the site seems to have covered the entire elevation, in as much as artifacts were found everywhere above the plain where visibility allowed teams to search. The BA inhabitants gathered plants for food, or actually engaged in agriculture. As the sea probably extended far inland at the time, they may have had some interest in marine resources available in the wide bay to their N. Further E, at Pountas East, not only BA, but also most historical periods are represented in the region. The Ephyra/Nekromanteion ridge. Intensive survey on all parts of this ridge yielded an interesting pattern of artifact distribution. The entire ridge was apparently exploited in both prehistoric and historical times, but a subtle shift in focus is implied: in the LBA settlement focused on the acropolis of Ephyra (Xylokastro hill), where one or more lines of enclos- ure/terrace walls were built in Cyclopaean fashion, and on the W slope of the hill. In the historical periods (HL and probably R), activity centered on the strongly fortified complex on Agios Ioannis hill, identified by Dakaris as the Oracle of the dead. Ridges N and NW of Kastri: Xirolophos 1 &amp; 2, Koronopou- los, Koroni, Kastriza, Koulia, Vlachia. A long range of human activity is evident at Xirolophos 2, NW of Stavrochorion, where BA pottery is strongly represented. Sherds of both the Gr and R periods were found, as well as distinctive Late Antique sherds, and some post-Med material. Substantial architectural remains were noted at Koronopoulos and Koroni, although at the latter site (Gr and R) many of the blocks have recently been pried out of place. Kastriza, where a fortification wall identified as C by Dakaris has long been known, proved to be particularly interesting. The strongest cultural signature belongs to the BA, even though only the historical occupation is mentioned in published reports. Hundreds of small sherds from Category II BA vessels were visible in patches of exposed surface, and 45 flint flakes were collected. In the walkover sample 60 sherds were classified as Gr and seven as R. The quantity of tile was inordinately low (approximately six pieces were noted, contrasted with 216 sherds and 45 flint flakes). This is a strange pattern for a walled settlement, and does not have a ready explanation. The lack of tiles under- scores the fundamentally PR emphasis of the site, and prompts questions about the date of the enclosure wall. Agios Thomas Peninsula. The regions of principal concern were: Metamorphosis/Agia Soteira. Remains of several walls, other architectural fragments, and scattered sherds and bricks mark the site of a small community by the sea, with easy access to Nikopolis. A date in the R period for the site is suggested both by the mortar and brick construction technique and by the presence of R cooking ware fragments. Vassoula and the area W of Neochori. The area of Vassou- la, the only major elevation on the peninsula other than Tourkovouni and Latomeio to the SE, produced only post-Med material that was diagnostic. S of Vassoula, however, a large ER habitation was found, as well as a number of N and BA lithics. Area framed by the villages of Ag. Triada, Ag. Thomas, and Ag. Apostoli. Survey here resulted in the identification of two site/scatters and confirmation of a third designated last year; all cultural material was R and Late Antique. In tracts in the same area the same periods were represented, as well as post-Med. Area of Ag. Minas and Lake Gavoyianni. The existence of an ECh basilica was already postulated at the church of Ag. Minas by the Byzantine Ephoreia, and our survey showed that the area of the church was rich in R, especially Late Antique, Med, and post-Med material. The site is at least 225 x 110m in size, but it was not possible to define all the boundaries with certainty. The absence of Gr material on the Ag. Thomas peninsula, which is yet to be explained, and the abundance of R and Late Antique material are consist- ent with the results of last year's survey. What is unusual in the 1994 results is the absence of finds from other periods that are well represented in last year's survey. Urban Survey. We selected Kastri as the urban site in which to conduct a thorough, intensive survey because it is the only one of the large fortified urban centres of our survey zone that is located in one of the regions (Acheron river valley) selected for special research emphasis by the project. The other urban centres (Kastro Rizovouni, Kastro Rogon and Palaioro- phoros) were only sampled: one day of survey was devoted to each. The survey will make possible a density map of artifacts counted and collected, and they will be correlated to the several structures discovered in the survey that are being drawn on a new map of the town. Other areas. A settlement occupied at least from HL to L antiquity occupied a large area near the present Church of the Panagia in the polje beyond the village of Cheimadhio. The site yielded a considerable quantity and variety of artifacts, including the only inscription found in 1994, a HL tombstone with the name Lysipolios. Two other small sites were identified in the area, one with lithics that might be Pal or N, the other MPal. Both sites also had some historical period roof tiles. The 33</page><page sequence="34">34 R. A. TOMLINSON investigation of the Pal and Mes periods in the Nome of Preveza was completed, and additional M and Upper Pal sites were identified. The most important are stratified MPal sites at Cheimadio, Loutsa and Anavatis near the village of Archangel- os. Another significant addition to the repertoire of Pal finds are bifacial leafpoints from Galatas and Agia. The magnificent leafpoint from Galatas is the finest example of this type of tool to be found in our survey area. Three new Mes sites were dis- covered in the vicinity of the town of Preveza. These were in fossil sand dune blowouts on the coast directly W of the town. They are characterized by microlithic tools, small arrowheads, and other minutely retouched, small scale artifacts, very similar to those found in the Acheron valley (Ammoudhia), Loutsa, and on Tourkovouni, Ag. Thomas. Considered together, the six known Mes sites add considerably to our understanding of this period in the region. Geophysical survey. Kastri. In the area E of the acropolis, where a cistern is visible, magnetometry and soil resistivity indicate a second cistern of similar depth and construction to its N. SE of the acropolis, in the flat area near the fortification wall and tower 4, prospection indicated a probable ancient street and structures in alignment with visible walls of build- ings. The most interesting result is a clear indication, in a grid in the upper town immediately S of the acropolis wall, of a large elliptical feature, ca 12m wide, perhaps of an apsidal building, with an internal rectangular structure. Kastro Rizovouni. Five grids of varying size were surveyed on the plateau of the church of the Panagia, and a sixth SE of the plateau by the remains of the post-Med structures. Data from near the church were magnetically masked by the iron door of the church itself, and further processing is needed to confirm details of walls faintly detrected, and their relation to those more clearly defined W and S of the church. Linear and rectangular features were detected in the sixth grid. Palaiorophoros. Three grids were surveyed in the lower city, one of which is of particular interest. Prospection by magnetometry was carried out within and around an ancient structure following a gridded surface survey and a total pick-up of artifacts. The locations of the artifacts can now be correlated with the sub-surface features indicated by prospection. Harbour town of Nikopolis, on the W arm of Ormos valley: three grids were surveyed with magnetometer and electromagnetic conductivity meter in the S section of the ancient town, and several structural features were detected which can in the future be plotted on a topographic map. Kleopatra, on the E arm of Ormos valley: the most interesting result of the geophysical data is a semicircular feature that extends across two contiguous grids for a distance of some 40m. Given the presence of N and BA material on the surface (in addition to R period remains), this may be a trench like those detected recently during the geophysical survey of the Makrygiallos project, where a defensive trench surrounds a PR settlement. There are, however, other possible interpretations and further analysis of the data is required." Perama Ioanninon. An important church attested in the sources as having been built at the beginning of the 16th Ct by the famous brothers Nektarios and Theophanes (founders of the Barlaam monastery at Meteora and that on the island in Lake Ioannina) was investigated on a hill N of Perama. This church of Ag. Nikolaos was a small, apparently single aisle structure. Very few finds were uncovered. (ADelt 43) Philippias. P. Vokotopoulos reports on his work in Ergon for 1994. Excavations revealed the form of the foundations for a church built on the deposits of the river Louros, whose bed is not far away. Graves were found, as in previous years, belonging to the 14-15th Ct period when the church was in use. Many graves were found and investigated W of the church, all in the form of trenches or cists, lined with roughly worked stones. Restoration work was carried out on the paved floor of the church, where broken slabs were cemented together, and the architectural elements of the ruined porch of the mosque of Faik Pasha W of Arta, which come from the Pantanassa, were restored to their proper places. SOUTHERN THESSALY (13th Ephorate) A full report of the Ephorate's activities in 1988 appears in ADelt 43. Agioi Theodoroi: Paliakastra (AR 1993-94, 46). During ploughing of the field of M. Trouke, 1.8km N of the village of Agioi Theodoroi and immediately E of the road to Gorgobites, architectural blocks and votive bases came to the surface. As two pits full of architectural fragments had been previously found in the adjacent field, the Ephorate undertook a small excavation. Two superimposed buildings were brought to light. The upper one was an L-shaped stoa with an open courtyard within its angle. All that remained was the foundation for the stylobate (width 1.30m), with a block from the lowest course of the stepped base on which the stylobate had stood preserved at the corer. Along the internal edge of the foundation, beside the court, ran an open stone gutter for rain-water. A few centimetres from this, in a line and parallel to it, were four votive bases. In a level of black earth which covered the foundation and the courtyard were fragments of marble statues of children, and poros architectural members. Amongst the sculpture fragments were the body of a statuette of Asklepios and another of Aphrodite. Three more votive bases associated with the lower, earlier building were found in situ, and the head and foot from the statue of a little girl, with part of the pedestal, lay nearby. There was no evidence for the exact foundation dates of the two buildings, but the finds show that they were in use from the 4th to the 2nd Cts BC and had some religious function. (ADelt 43) Alonnesos (anc. Ikos), Palio Chorio: Prinari (Kaliagres). At a short distance from the hill with the chapel of Ag. Ioannes, the known archaeological site of one of the two cities of ancient Ikos, the excavation of two building plots on the ENE side of Palio Chorio brought to light the first indication of the C cemetery of the ancient settlement. The three cist tombs, unfortunately damaged by the mechanical excavator, contained inhumations and poorly-preserved bg pots (kantharos, skyphos). It was the first excavation to take place at this site. (ADelt 43) Argithea (Knisovo). During widening of the public road from Argithea towards Epeiros, ancient tombs were discovered in the Ellenika locality where the archaeological site of Argithea is situated. The tombs were part of the E cemetery of the ancient town, which is located higher up. In a three-month rescue excavation L. Chatziangelakes and two colleagues excavated about 170 late C- HL tombs. The tombs were stone slab cists on a ENE-WSW orientation. Though many had been looted and destroyed or had no grave goods, others contained pots, lamps, loomweights, swords, knives, jewellery and coins. Beside a peribolos in which T 25 was situated, was found a</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 35 funerary stele with the inscription: KPATEIAX XAAKEYX / EIPOTINOX nIPATEIA / ENOAAE KEITAI. Another inscription on the upper part of a monument read ETAOMON- NQ ANTIKPATOYE. The excavation of this important cemetery could not be completed for lack of funds. (ADelt 43) Beletsino (anc. Pherai). Seven more building plots excavated by the Ephor, A. Intzesiloglou, and P. Arachovite, added to the history and topography of the ancient city, of which fortunately only the SE quarter lies beneath moder Belestino. The G. Ch. Laitsos plot was on the summit of Kastraki hill, NE of the Hypereian Fountain, and a few metres S of a visible portion of the city wall. A test dug to bedrock, in the small area required for the extension of the existing house, provided a microcosm of the area's history. Five tombs and two ossuaries of the Ott period, built from HL and C spolia, were cut into EHL strata. There were two HL building phases, a possible C wall, then three G tombs cut into a Myc destruction. There were two late Myc. building phases, both destroyed by fire. The earlier was founded on a very thin MH stratum. Finds of all periods included parts of figurines, stamped tiles, HL coins, Myc clay models of animals, fragments of obsidian blades, and two N sherds, the latter a most unusual occurence, as no N strata had been found in the area of the ancient city. Other plots provided more detailed information about individual periods. The field of A. Markopoulos lay directly NE of the ancient fortifications on Kastraki Hill and a little to the W of the HL stoa in the probable agora area. Columns, a threshold, a pedestal and the mouth of an underground silo were visible on the surface. Clearing the surface level over a wide area produced quantities of HL pottery. The underground storage chamber was partly excavated, but the work proved too dangerous to continue. Its maximum excavated diameter was 1.6m, while that of its mouth was .8m. The excavation was to continue. The K. Kyriazes plot on Plateia Smolenske in the SW part of Belestino, which coincides with the SE part of anc. Pherai, was at a considerable distance from the G settlement on and N of 'Magoula Bakale'. Despite this, a small G cist grave was found during the excavation of a bothros, which demonstrated how widely-scattered cemeteries were in the G period. The Apostolinas Bros. plot on Pheron, on the W edge of Belestino, was in a positon equivalent to the S side of the ancient city, fairly near the centre. It contained the greater part of the foundations of a HL house, with part of a road to its W. It had a central courtyard(?) with a well, and numerous rooms which did not always communicate directly with it, producing a labyrinthine effect. A room to the N of the courtyard had a built-in bench and a rectangular patch of flooring consisting of grey pebbles with a neat border of larger unworked stones. A room W of this had an internal small wail with bases set in it about im from its N and W sides, forming a kind of L-shaped stoa or cloister, so that the area it surrounded may have been unroofed. There were many signs of repairs and alterations. Contemporary material from numerous rubbish pits dug in the floors showed that the building was in use in the 2nd and 1st Cts BC. The building was founded partly on bedrock, and partly on a fill which contained MH, PG and C sherds, but no other building remains were encountered. The El. Chatzetheodoros plot on M. Antypa was on the NE side of Belestino, about 50m NW of part of the city wall. An Ott drain which ran right across the plot, approximately E-W, and a HL drain which did the same from SE to W, coincided in the W of the plot. S of the drains were two corers of a HL building or buildings. In the W of the plot, on the same orientation and of the same date, were four marble blocks, ca 1 x im (?pillar bases) set equidistant from each other and forming a corer-perhaps part of a stoa. In the E part of the plot, N of the drains, was part of an earlier house, possibly C, and to the W of it, unconnected with any of the other remains was a small G(?) cist grave. The plot of I. Giatsos and M. Tsoumpekos was in the Aulagadia locality on the W edge of Belestino. Its S boundary coincided with the line of the S part of the city wall, which was partly visible on the surface. A 45m long test confirmed that the wall continued right across the plot. Both the internal and external faces were preserved, the latter to a height of 2.90m (4 courses). It was 3.40-3.45m wide. It was founded on the rock, and its foundation course and first course were set in a foundation trench filled with unworked stones, chips, bits of tile and sherds; the internal fill was also of stone chips. At its W end was a rectangular tower standing 3.40m high and at the E end of the test the place were the wall changed direction and continued to the SSE was found. The construction of the wall was the same as that of the fortifications on the Acropolis on Ag. Athanasios Hill, which dates to the 4th Ct BC. The excavation of an internal bothros for a cafeneion on Rega Pheraiou belonging to Emm. Chatzetheodoros uncovered another small part of the external face of the city wall. It ran NE-SW, and should form part of the SE trace of the wall, which was found in a neighbouring plot. Stone chips near the wall's face showed that the final dressing of the blocks had taken place on the spot during building. (ADelt 43) A small, simple HL marble tombstone from the N cemetery of anc. Pherai, from the Thymarakia locality, was handed in. It bore the inscription AYEYAON / ONOKOFIA Both the name and the patronymic are unusual,and it may perhaps have been a slave's memorial. Extensive remains of an Ott aqueduct were located on the nearby Kranovo, Mavrolithi and Kiougi sites. (ADelt 43) Demetriada (anc. Demetrias). Four small rescue excavations and one larger one took place within the ancient city in 1988. In the Theo. Syres plot (S of the road to Peukakia), part of a R building with one larger room and many small compartments lay .10m below the surface. Pottery, lamps, bone objects, bronze coins and nails were found, but nothing that could indicate a specific use. The building was founded in the 1st Ct BC. Six later, but undatable tile graves were within the walls. In the plot of T. Zervas, near the magoula of Peukakia, a test trench brought to light the NW corer of the peristyle of a HL house. In the K. Karagiannes plot, S of the ancient theatre, a wall and some roof tiles were found while excavating a cistern; there was no dating material. In the Aibaliotika quarter, mechanical clearing of the K. Bergiotes plot uncovered three connected LR walls, of which one with a width of 1.60m may have been connected with the LR fortification of the city. Also in the Aibaliotika quarter, construction of a kerb brought to light an E-W wall with a visible length of 24m, preserved to a height of 1.10m. It had a N face of large blocks backed by a filling of smaller stones, and seems to have been a terrace or facing wall. (ADelt 43) Dimeni (Mycenaean Settlement). In 1988 rescue excavations were necessary when antiquities were located in plots on the flat plain immediately to the seaward side of the neolithic mound of Dimeni, where a Mycenaean settlement (possibly the legendary Iolkos-AR 1992-93, 47) was discovered some years ago. V. Adryme-Sismane reports on two such cases. The M.</page><page sequence="36">36 R. A. TOMLINSON Baitsopoulos plot was the neighbour of the expropriated Zographou plot (AR 1991-92, 39) excavated in 1984, which contained six Myc rooms and two smaller compartments. As the work in the Baitsopoulos plot consisted only of a bothros, only a small test, 2 x 4m was opened, but it was carried to bedrock, 1.80m below the surface. Mycenaean levels were encountered only .20m below the surface, and two building phases were found. The latest, consisting of part of an exterior and an interior wall, dated to LH IIIB2. Immediately below these walls were two more, parallel to each other and 2.50m apart. The fill above the clay floor associated with them contained LH IIIB sherds, mainly plain domestic and coarse- wares, also quite a number of sea shells. Below the floor was a child burial in a cist tomb; its only grave goods were two large sea shells. An earlier floor belonging to the same walls had abundant LH IIIA2 sherds, and a pit filled with LH IIIA2 material and animal bones was located below the cist tomb. Below the LH IIIA2 floor was a mixed level containing mostly hand-made pottery, though there was some monochrome wheel-made and a few MH sherds. The earlier Myc walls were founded on this level. The N. Kotsales plot was to the E of the Myc town and bordered on the (later expropriated) Karyofiles plot, where in 1980 the 13th Ephorate found the most significant remains of the Myc period in the area: a wide road with five independent private dwellings on either side of it. One of these dwellings, House A, was against the W boundary of the Kotsales plot. A test was set out parallel to the expropriated plot, and immedi- ately below .30m of topsoil two rooms of a Myc house appeared, with their clay floors only .54m below the surface. The small quantity of pottery on them was LH IIIB2; two fragmentary figurines, one Phi and one Psi, were also found. The walls were on the same orientation as the buildings in the neighbouring plot and obviously belonged to the same building complex. Owing to exceptional circumstances, work had to stop at this point, so the earlier levels were not tested-it was hoped to continue the excavation later. The results obtained did serve to reinforce the impression that the settlement was abandoned after the LH IIIB2 period. The very few LH IIIC1 sherds found in other parts of the site suggest that only a small portion of it was occupied then. (ADelt 43) Ermetsi. A pithos rim with a partially preserved inscription was found in the church plot of this community and handed in. (ADelt 43) Georgiko: Malamata. (2km SW of Karditsa.) On public land (formerly the Karatelios property) illicit digging necessitated the excavation of three cist tombs, a single one and two joined together. In the latter a bronze coin was found; otherwise the tombs were completely looted and partly destroyed. They belonged to the SE cemetery of anc. Metropolis. (ADelt 43) Kallithero: Agiou Athanasiou (AR 1993-94, 47). Anc. Kallithera is located on the hill of Ag. Athanasios. In 1988 an excavation took place on its SE side where both rectangular blocks and the trenches left by their removal for use in building village houses were visible. The excavation, which was to continue, uncovered 21m of the ancient city's' fortifica- tion wall. For most of its length only one course was pre- served, and in some places only its foundation trench remained; two courses were occasionally found on the inner face. The wall was built of blocks of local grey limestone which had roughly-worked convex surfaces; it was 2.70m wide. Between the two faces, in some places the fill was largely of river pebbles, while in others the bedrock had been left proud. The part of the wall excavated was on a steep slope. Within the city, part of a road running parallel to the wall was excavated. Its original surface had been made by levelling the bedrock. On it lay a thin layer of tiles of Lakonian type, which were covered by a thick level of yellow, greasy earth without any finds, almost certainly fallen, decayed unbaked mud brick. In the road test a terrace wall was found, of similar construction to the fortification wall and parallel to it and to the road. Four courses were preserved. Within the town, a few metres from the terrace wall, two tombs were found which had been cut into the stratum of fallen mud brick. One was a pit grave and one a tile grave; both were oriented E-W and the heads of the dead were to the west. There were no grave goods. Nothing was found that could date any of the above-mentioned remains. (ADelt 43) E. Skordas' Field. A 5.30m length of wall foundation was found here. It was of similar construction to and parallel to a similar wall foundation discovered previously in the neighbour- ing field, and it is likely the two were part of a tower in the ancient city's fortification system. In the fill of the tower was found a bronze coin of Larisa, which gives an approximate 4th Ct BC date for the fortifications' construction. Xynobryse (AR 1994-95, 47). This locality, known as a cemetery from 1987, suffered from illicit digging; as a result a trench was set out in an area a few metres to the N of the tombs excavated in 1987, where the NW corer of a building was visible. This proved to be a subterranean vaulted R chamber tomb, very curiously constructed, some parts being of flat, fired bricks, but others of unworked stones and pebbles. The interior of the tomb was filled with the debris of its fallen vault. There were no finds at all in it, no wall plaster either on the walls or in the debris, no steps from the high-set entrance to the tomb floor, which was of levelled bedrock in which the foundation trench cut for the walls was still visible. This latter feature, plus the lack of plaster and the complete absence of finds suggests that the vault collapsed before the tomb was completed, so that it was never used. The date of its construc- tion is of course unknown, but a coin of the Empress Salonina above the level of the fallen vault gives a terminus ante quem in the second half of the 3rd Ct AD. (ADelt 43) Karditsa. The police at Karditsa handed in a coin collection to the Ephorate, which was sent to the Numismatic Museum in Athens for inspection. Of 23 coins, 14 turned out to be later copies. At the end of 1987, the Karditsa police also confiscated a collection of 88 ancient and later objects from the house of A. Betas, most of them broken and of little worth. The most valuable were again coins, ranging from 5th Ct BC to 17th Ct AD, also sent to the Numismatic Museum. (ADelt 43) Kataphylli Argitheas: Tampouri. B. Tsiakalos handed in to the Ephorate a bronze coin of the Aetolian League 3rd-2nd Cts BC and a clay lamp. (ADelt 43) Mataranga: Agios Andreas. P. Basileiou handed in 240 objects found in her field after ploughing. They included G bronze bracelets and rings, a Myc figurine, bronze rings of various periods, stone spindle whorls, seal-stones, HL and R bronze coins, a silver Byz coin and other objects. (ADelt 43) Metropolis. During the excavation of a bothros in the plot of T. Koukouzeles, a 1st Ct BC tile grave was discovered. 15 bronze coins were found together in the tomb fill; 12 of them were of the Thessalian Confederation. (ADelt 43)</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 Mouzaki (anc. Gomphoi): Episkopi. Clearing and some excavation of two stretches of the fortification wall of anc. Gomphoi took place in 1988. A 63m length of the outer face was exposed in the expropriated Giannoules plot on the W side of the hill, and a further 22.50m length to the N of it in Forestry Dept land. The wall followed the ridge of the hill's summit, running SE to NW. Usually only one course was preserved. It was built of carefully-joined, well-worked poros blocks. Two towers, 33.70m apart, were found on the expropri- ated land. The southernmost projected 2.70m from the wall face and the width of its foundation course was 7.74m. The wall changed direction at the second tower, which was partly destroyed. A third tower was found on the Forestry Dept. land, which again projected 2.70m and was 6.80m wide. In several parts of the wall, worked blocks were laid crosswise forming compartments which were 2.38-2.67m in width. In the fill outside the wall for almost the whole excavated length, tiles fallen from the towers and battlements were found. The wall was destroyed for the first time by Amynandros, king of the Athamanians, in 198 BC. Blocks from the wall were built into many R-LR houses of the ancient city. A. Alexandres handed in a number of objects found in his vineyard at Episkopi, including loomweights, sherds, part of a figurine mould, and coins. (ADelt 43) Nea Soupre. The previously unreported monastery of Ag. Triada, dating to the second half of the 12th Ct, is mentioned in ADelt 43. Conservation work is in progress. No other information is supplied. Nea Anchialos. Conservation and excavation work continued in 1987 in this immensely important site. A. Ntina reports new finds. Remains located included those of ECh secular structures whose exact nature has yet to be established. Unidentified (in 1987) bronze coins, pottery, five ECh tombs, and mosaic floor fragments (Evlogimenou and Stavride Sts.) also came to light. (ADelt 43) Palamas: Mousitses. In the field of S. Boutsas a R tomb, type unspecified, was destroyed during deep ploughing. It was dated by a lamp found in the overturned earth by the area's archae- ological guard D. Arampatses. (ADelt 43) Philia. In a field belonging to the Xanas brothers, situated NE of the fenced archaeological site of the sanctuary of Itonian Athena, rectangular blocks were regularly turned up during agricultural work. Excavation uncovered a wall which ran N-S and had a straight face on its E side only. Only one course was preserved, built of reused limestone and sandstone blocks. W of the wall and parallel to it were small parts of two R buildings. E of it were two rectangular pottery kilns, one large and one small. The larger one had had a firing chamber floor supported by a double row of arches resting on a central row of five pillars and on equivalent buttresses in the side walls, and two separate stoke-holes; on its fire-box floor were found fallen bits of the pierced clay floor, warped discoid loom- weights with circles in relief, and almond-shaped clay pot- supports used in the kiln.The smaller kiln had only one buttress on each side to support the floor, and only one stoke hole. Nothing was found in it except two more pot-supports. It is suggested that the wall may have been part of the E wall of the peribolos of the sanctuary in the R period-thus the two R buildings would be within the sanctuary, and the kilns outside it. In one part of the excavation, a thick grey stratum contained dozens of glass paste beads of many varieties, many fragments of bronze fibulae of the various known types and other small objects which date to the second half of the 8th and the first half of the 7th Cts BC. At Philia also, the mosaic in the R building excavated by Theochares in 1963 was re-examined after its original sand covering had been dangerously depleted by weather and time. The mosaic was found to be in very good condition; some very minor repairs were made, and it was photographed and re- covered. (ADelt 43) Phthiotic Thebes. During cultivation, tombs were found in the field of N. Niforos, just outside the village of Mikrothebes (formerly Aketsi), on the national highway in the direction of Anchialos. The investigation by the Ephorate located three vaulted children's graves, a stone heap composed of fragments of funerary steles, and a notable circular pit with clay figurines of men, women and children, whole pots, iron nails and lead fragments. The tombs probably belong to the cemetery of Phthiotic Thebes. They contained intact and broken pottery, lamps and metal objects, notably a well-preserved bronze strigil. The finds in the field were 4th-3rd Cts BC. (ADelt 43) Platanidia. Excavations uncovered the semi-circular apse of Basilica A and part of a mosaic floor with foliate and dissected circle motifs with tendril border. (ADelt 43) Pyrgos Kieriou. P. Lappas handed in a marble funerary stele with a sculptured scene showing five standing human forms-three men, a woman, and a child who turns towards the female form. The stele was found in a field in the locality known as Magkarades. A. Bakales handed in 24 objects, including coins of the Thessalians, Cassander, Demetrios Poliorketes and one of Kierion. (ADelt 43) Skopelos (anc. Peparethos), Chora: Asklepieion. In 1988 repairs to the jetty and shore road of the island's main town involved the removal of slabs of cement which allowed the excavation of a wall beneath. The wall was well-designed and constructed with two faces of rectangular marble blocks on a wide schist slab base. It was thought to have been part of the NE side of the perivolos of the Asklepieion, most of which has fallen victim to the waves. The wall now lies under the new shore road, protected by a layer of earth. (ADelt 43) Panormos: Paliokastro. The lack of an archaeological guard inthe N Sporades enabled the owner of the A. Chatzedr- osos plot, which lies on the SW slopes of Paliokastro hill, to start building a set of hotel bungalows during 1986-87 without the knowledge, permission or supervision of the Ephorate. Paliokastro (anc. Panormos), in the SW of the island, is a known archaeological site with visible remains of fortifications, terrace walls, and other buildings. In 1988 the Ephorate conducted an excavation in the area of the bungalows to estimate the condition of antiquities in their vicinity. In four out of eight small tests, the fortification wall was located. It was founded on the rock, and in one trench the external face stood 3m high. It was very well built, in uncoursed rectangular polygonal masonry in the local grey limestone. Against the outer face of the wall was a pit containing large pieces of amphoras, tiles and other pots, including some bg. It was apparently part of the dump from a potter's work- shop. The amphoras were of particular interest, as they were of the local Paparethan type recently identified by the excavator, A. Intzesiloglou, and her colleague Y. Garlan (BCH cxiv (1990), 1,361-89). They match previously unidentified amphoras, known from the Black Sea, confirming an ancient 37</page><page sequence="38">38 R. A. TOMLINSON reference to the importation of Peparethan wine in the Black Sea cities. (ADelt 43) Soros: Asprogeia Neon Pagason (AR 1993-94, 46). More tombs belonging to the cemetery of the settlment on the hill of Soros (2.5km S of Demetriada) were found. Three were in the Chr. Manos plot on Doulkeroglou and 16 in the B.X. Metritsas plot on 28th Oktobriou. All were cist tombs except for two sarcophagi. They often contained more than one burial, and ranged in date from early 5th Ct to end 2nd/beginning 1st Cts BC. Many had no grave goods. Where these existed, they were almost always confined to pottery and lamps. (ADelt 43) Sykies: Tymbos. After illicit digging and looting of a tomb in the tumulus which had been partly investigated in 1983 (ADelt 38), the remainder was excavated. The looted tomb was a lamax of the same type and dimensions as the first tomb excavated in 1983. The bones were completely disturbed, but in the earth in the tomb was found a silver ring with a dog represented on the oval bezel. In the centre of the mound was another lamax with a double cover. The skeleton lay on its back, and appeared wedged into the tomb. At its feet were remains of soles and there were also cloth remains at the centre of the sides of the tomb. This tomb was at a lower level than the others, and in the centre of the tumulus, whereas the rest were round the edge. It was therefore the earliest of the group. Part of an inscribed marble funerary stele was found in a field on council land at Sykies and handed in to the Ephorate. (ADelt 43) Trygona. K. Pantos handed in to the Ephorate a fragmentary inscribed marble block which was in his house. (ADelt 43) Volos: Nea Ionia (AR 1993-94, 48). During mechanical digging on the T. Chatzekosmas plot on Bizaniou 5,10 C-R tombs were discovered. They belonged to the large cemetery W of the Krausidonas torrent, which has been excavated from time to time since 1981. (ADelt 43) Palea quarter (A. Kokotsika plot, Belisariou 38). This plot was on the summit of the hill known as anc. Iolkos, 20m N of the well-known excavation by Theochares. A deep sounding (4 x 4m) was made to examine the stratigraphy. After the removal of topsoil, remains of at least two ECh building phases were encountered. A wide variety of pottery of the period, fragments of glass vessels and plates, bronze coins, nails, and bronze, stone and iron tools were collected. Pits had disturbed the stratigraphy to a depth of ca 4m. Strata ca 2m thick contained important G-PG pottery and other finds and four building phases, with clear evidence for various destructions which had necessitated the rebuilding. Below these were three PG child burials in cists, cut into Myc levels. The narrowness and depth of the test, plus various disturbances, made it difficult to distinguish individual Myc building phases. Most of the pottery was LH IIIB 1-LH IIIB2, alongside which was found handmade polished pottery with relief decoration (barbarian ware). LH IIIA2 and LH IIIC sherds were also present. MH levels ca 2m thick contained at least three building phases, which had walls.40-.90m wide made of small unworked stones and mud, and unusual floors of successive layers of clay mixed with beach gravel and crushed shells. Grey and red Minyan pottery, matt-painted and polychrome ware were all represented. When the test had reached a depth of 9.10m, it was reduced to 1 x im, and yet another MH building phase was identified in this, but shortly afterwards the water table was reached, and work had to stop. The test proved continuous occupation of the area from MH to ECh, with particularly flourishing settlements in the MH, G and ECh periods. (ADelt 43) Zastene Argalastes. During the winter of 1987, illicit digging took place on the land of G. Konstantakes very close to a known ancient quarry. Two cist tombs were found. The first had been looted. The second contained a HL monochrome hydria and two other small pots, fragments of three skulls and other bones. On one of the cover slabs were a lamp and potsherds. No other tombs were located, and the graves may have been those of ancient quarry workers. (ADelt 43) PHTHIOTIS (14th Ephorate) Atalante. The coastal Palaiomagaza site covers a long period from HL to ECh. The floor of a three-apse structure with fine masonry including spolia was mostly covered with mosaic. Other structures were uncovered to the north, including two with conches at their S ends, of the same date and the three- apsed building. These also were floored with mosaics, mostly decorated with geometric motifs. Evidence (mostly pottery and mosaics) indicates that this was probably an ECh ecclesiastical and bath complex. (ADelt 43) Halai. J. Coleman (ASCS) reports on a study season: "Many aspects of the site and movable finds were studied and a report on the last three years' work was in final prepara- tion for publication in Hesperia. Fourteen finds were handed over to the Ephorate at Lamia for display in the new Museum. Initial conservation measures were taken at the site. We backfilled parts of the fortifications at the S corer of the site, and parts of the R remains near the SW comer of area E." NORTHERN THESSALY (15th Ephorate) Museums and Archaeological Collections. A. Tziaphalias has made a considerable contribution to the epigraphy of Thessaly by publishing a catalogue, with texts and some illustrations, of over 80 inscriptions which have accumulated through chance finds and donations in the Larisa Museum and the archaeologi- cal collections at Trikala, Pythio Elassonas and Pharsala. Thirty-seven are from anc. Atrax, but anc. Argissa, Eretria Pharsalon, Homolion, Krannon, Larisa, Phalanna, Pharkadon, Pharsala, Pilennaion, Pythio, Skotousa, Trikke and other sites are also represented. Most are funerary steles of the 4th- st Cts BC, but there are also decrees, honorary decrees, dedications, a herm, a few manumissions, and one or two unusual pieces such as an early 5th Ct BC Doric column capital from Atrax and an inscribed marble treasury or money-box from Krannon. The inscriptions in the Pharsala Archaeological Collection, previously unavailable to scholars, are particularly interesting. Two examples follow, both from anc. Skotousa: Cat.

The Archaeological Collection here, which till early 1988 was housed in the home of the district's archaeological guard Ioannes Gougoulias, was transferred to rented premises near the central plateia when he retired after 30 years' invalu- able service to the antiquities of the district. The collection, consisting largely of inscriptions and some sculpture, was rearranged and catalogued, and a new guard was appointed. Trikala. 70 coins from anc. Pharkadon were presented to the Trikke Archaeological Collection by Mr Zamzaras, a resident of Klokotas. (ADelt 43) Agiokampos: Skiatha. (40km ENE of Larisa, on the coast.) A. Tziafalias reports on a 4-month programme mounted by the 15th Ephorate in 1988 with the object of locating and identify- ing the famous Thessalian coastal city of Meliboia, first mentioned in Homer as the native place of Philoktetes. After repeated investigation of the shore in the Agiokampos district, the choice fell on previously-known ruins at Skiatha. This ancient site extends E into the sea from the foothills of Mavro- vouni, the central part of the mountain chain formed by Ossa to the N and Pelion to the S. On a most inhospitable coast, it has small harbours both to the N and S of it, thus offering shelter irrespective of wind direction. Its inland side is pro- tected to the N, W and E by a torrent bed, in some places over 20m deep. Two cemeteries were located beyond it. With funding from the Nome of Larisa and special permission and help from the Forestry Department, oak forest and thick undergrowth were cleared in a swathe 8m wide along lkm of the outer face of the fortifications, and smaller roads were cut into the centre of the site. The walls had suffered much damage from many causes, lime kilns (found nearby) being the worst. Though the upper courses were of local granite, the foundations and first course were of marble, and lime-burners had wrecked the walls in order to obtain the marble. Numerous C-HL sherds were found all over the interior of the site, from the 2nd half of the 5th Ct to the first half of the 2nd Ct BC, after which the site was abandoned. Amongst the material collected were many stamped amphora handles, showing the settlement had close relations with the great commercial harbours of antiquity. For reasons which were to be published in a separate article, it was thought unlikely that this site was anc. Meliboia, and more probable that it was the harbour town of one of the large inland cities of Thessaly, or indeed the chief harbour for all the N. Thessalian hinterland. (ADelt 43) Dasochori Grevenon. (6km S of Deskati.) The President of Dasochori, Mr Kakagiannes, informed the Ephorate about a site on the hill Kastri, ca lkm SSE of the village. Heaps of stones from fallen walls, sherds and broken roof tiles were found, and there were indications of a peribolos or fortification. Local inhabitants gave information about tombs on level ground to the NNW and NNE of Kastri. Sherds and other surface finds dated to HL and Ott. (ADelt 43) Doliche Elassonas. A mound near the primary school in the centre ofthe village, always supposed to be a tumulus, proved to be a natural feature. (ADelt 43) Eretria Pharsalon. Excavation in the N cemetery brought to light a cist tomb with walls and cover slabs of green schist. It contained three skeletons, a bronze Macedonian coin,an amphora of the 'Macedonian' type, three unguentaria, a small handleless skyphos and a Megarian bowl with plant decoration. It was constructed during the reign of Philip V and continued in use until the mid-2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 43) Grevena Project. W. Coulson, J. Rosser and N. Wilkie (ASCS) continued their study of the pottery collected during the course of the survey. All pottery profiles have now been drawn, but final study and photography of the material remains. S. Aschenbrenner obtained GPS readings for 83 sites. He also asisted G. Johnson with balloon photography of five sites: Panaghia/Itea, Pitska/Syndendron, Paleokastro/Syndren- don, Spileo, and Agia Varvara/ Agios Giorgios. In addition G. Johnson mapped the site of Paleogla/ Dasaki. Gyrtone Larisas. (13km N of Larisa.) The greater part of the mod. village is built on a PR magoula, but towards its N end there are visible remains of a HL hamlet. The famed Thessal- ian city of Gyrtone is often located here, though so far there is no archaeological evidence to support the identification. In 1988 in the field of A. Tsetsilas, which was within the area of the HL settlement, agricultural work destroyed wall foundations built of rectangular slabs of local green schist which were only .15m below the surface. They were those of a rectangular building 10 x 20m, oriented E-W. 20m E of the building was a marble pillar capital, probably belonging to it. In the general area many fragments of votive steles without inscriptions were found. The building may have been a temple forming part of a sanctuary complex of the late HL period. (ADelt 43) Kalambaka: Theopetra Cave. (Mouta Cave, 3km E of Kalambaka). The Press report levels extending from MPal to N, including two human skeletons, one dated to ca 14,500 BC, the other to ca 8,500 BC. N. Kyparissi-Apostolika gives an account of the second (1988) season of this important excavation in the report of the Ephorate of Paleoanthropology and Speleology in ADelt 43, and covers the first three seasons in an extended article in Archaiologia 34 (March 1990), 112-15. All tests confirmed that the cave was inhabited EN-end LN/beginning of EBA, pottery and other finds typical of all these periods being recovered. At the end of the 1988 season animal bones represented sheep/goat (60%), cattle (18%), pig and wild pig (12%), two species of deer (3%) dog or related species (4%); horse, badger, tortoise, and microfauna were also present. The second and third seasons showed that the cave had in fact been</page><page sequence="40">40 R. A. TOMLINSON continuously inhabited since MPal. A C,4 test on a sample which was not from the cave's earliest levels gave a result of 38,578 BP (+3963 -2642), which was close to that obtained by Milojcic for Pal levels on the Peneios banks. The oldest Theopetra stone tools also resembled the Peneios Pal assem- blage. The stone and mud wall found on the interface between pottery and pre-pottery levels in 1987 did not continue in two adjacent tests, but where it might have been expected there were banks of clay which may have been part of it. Two floors were associated with the wall and a third ran beneath it. Each had an area of burning, probably from an open hearth. Near the wall lay lumps of clay with impressions of reeds and sticks fallen from a roof or walls. In a Pal level, small rectangular mounds of unfired clay were found, apparently an early attempt to fashion clay long before the firing process was discovered. At about the same depth, small heaps of vivid red earth were encountered, perhaps for use as colouring matter. The original rock floor of the cave had been reached only in tests near its edges, and not in its centre, where most activity took place, though tests here were over 4m deep. The Theopetra excava- tion is the first in Thessaly to record continuous Pal-end of N occupation in a cave. Kalo Nero Larisas. An R mosaic with a central panel repre- senting Nike crowning Agon was found ca 500m N of this settlement when a drainage ditch was cut in 1969 (ADelt 24). In 1988 the enlargement of the ditch enabled a rescue excavation to take place. Part of a large building and more of the same mosaic were discovered. The mosaic border consisted of a complex geometric design executed in black and orange on a white ground. (ADelt 43) Kileler (Kypseli) Larisas. (24km SE of Larisa.) When digging a bothros for his house, A. Balas struck a Myc tomb, which contained four intact and one broken alabastra, some human bones, a rock crystal bead and a few C sherds. He handed the finds in to the Larisa police, who informed the Ephorate. The small excavation which followed showed the tomb to have been a pit grave cut into bedrock from a level 1.20m below the mod. surface. Its N and W sides were bounded by squared-off and unworked limestones and according to the owner the other two sides had been similarly defined, forming a parallelogram ca 2.60 x 1.60m. The alabastra were simply decorated with common motifs and dated LH IIIA1-LH IIIB1. The tomb was the first to be located in a cemetery which must have belonged to the Myc settlement on the magoula Kypseli I (site No. 265 in the Ephorate's topographical records). The magoula is immediately SSE of the mod. village and the tomb was about 700m NW of it. (ADelt 43) Larisa (AR 1993-94, 50). Four rescue excavations took place in 1988. At Nirvana 12 a 2nd-3rd CT AD rectangular cistern projected into the N side of the plot at 2m below the moder surface, but the greater part of it was below the adjacent building. It was 2.60 x 1.30m x ca 2m deep and built of square, fired bricks bonded with mortar. Its interior was coated with a layer of waterproof cement .12m thick. Its cover was composed of re-used architectural members, including two inscriptions. One, almost 2m long, had many lines concerning manumissions. Unfortunately attempts to remove it had to cease because they threatened to bring down the adjacent house; it also proved impossible to take an impression of more than a few words of it. The other, which was removed with great difficulty, was a votive stele of white marble with the lines: noe6£toovt / KEitoc Ktvtaoca 7c p / tot i:ot6b; kXtpov (Larisa Mus. Cat No. 88/80). At Asklepiou 55 during mechanical digging of foundations for a multi-storey appartment block, parts of three areas in a large R public bath complex were brought to light, including part of a hypocaust. Two building phases could be distin- guished. S Cemetery. Two plots in the same vicinity contained graves belonging to the known and extensive S cemetery of anc. Larisa, in use from the 4th Ct BC to LR, which extended along the main road to anc. Skotousa and Pharsala. In Thessal- onikes 174, six unaccompanied burials, five tile graves and one brick-built cist, were found. In Heroon Polytechneiou 167, there were 49 burials, here dating second half of 3rd Ct BC to 4th Ct AD. They consisted of six ur burials (all infants/children), a lamax (looted), 26 tile graves and 16 open graves in shallow pits which contained iron nails, suggesting the initial presence of a coffin or bier. The dead were placed extended on their backs with arms by their sides or with hands folded on the chest or belly area. Most were single burials, but T.3 had two children and T.20 two adults buried together. T.4 had three successive burials. There were examples of later burials destroying earlier ones, and collections of bones in pits, apparently from older tombs cleared away to make room for new ones. The burials were mostly poor and the majority had no grave goods. Where these existed, they were nearly always clay pots-kyathoi, skyphoi, lagynoi, cups, Megarian bowls, unguentaria-and occasional glass vessels, nearly all tear flasks. T.6 had, besides (HL?) pottery, an intact figurine of a loaded ass and part of a small clay comic mask. From tombs wrecked by mechanical digging before the Ephorate was informed, and from the disturbed earth generally, a large number of pots and glass vessels of the types already indicated were collected, many of them undamaged. Also found were a clay imitation of a tragic mask, coins, lamps, loomweights, a broken clay chest which had contained a cremation, and upper part of a gabled marble funerary stele plus its rectangular base. On the stele's main face was the inscription: KXEot6tcpac / N£KO6ftIOu / XprsfTil ati/p£. Below the inscription were incised represen- tations of a herm and a tear-flask. (ADelt 43) Part of the paved atrium and drainage system for the central fountain of an ECh basilica located in 1978 was uncovered on Kyprou and Androutsou Sts., although in poor condition. A fine ECh mosaic (2.95 x 2.53) with fish and bird motifs was located on Kyprou St. (ADelt 43) Megalo Seireni Grevenon. (4km NNW of Grevena.) In the Ag. Athanasios locality and only 5m from the small shrine after which it is named, thieves found and looted a cist tomb. All that remained in it were a few bones and some undiagnos- tic sherds. (ADelt 43) Mt. Chassia Survey. B. Helly, L. Darmezin, J.-C. Decourt and G. Lucas of the French School reported on the 1988 season of this survey. Fieldwork in that year was confined to the SE of the Anti-Chassia range, centred on the village of Megalo Eleftherochorio between the Titaresios and the Peneios Rivers. The middle and upper valleys of the Titaresios were also explored. The object was to establish the exact locations of C- HL sites in the area. Remains at Grizana near Farkadona and near Neochorio-Oichalia were considered to be Byz only, but an anc. city at the kastro of Neoi Smoliai, near Agrelia was a possibility. It seemed likely that anc. Erikinion should be re- located to Blachogianne; near here on a rise called Anglistras a PR or proto-historic establishment was also noted, while S of</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 Blachogianne was a strong kastro with polygonal walls. Palaiokastro village S of the Elassona-Deskati road may have been the site of anc. Mondiaia. Except for the kastro of Didata, remains in the valley of Karya (ca. 22km NE of Elassona) were all PR or proto-historic, but an important settlement with impressive walls was located in the neighbour- ing foothills at the village of Argyropoulis. No signs of anc. Askouris were found in the Karya locality, but it may have been represented by remains in the Sparmos valley, further W (ADelt 43). Later seasons of this survey were noted in AR 1989-90, 50; 1991-92, 42; 1992-93, 52; 1993-94, 50. Pharsala. Of six building plots excavated here in 1988, reported by S. Katakouta and G. Toufexis in ADelt 43, five contained parts of the ancient fortifications, including towers and gates. This access of information was incorporated in a new study on the walls of anc. Pharsala by the same archaeol- ogists (Archaiologia 34 (March 1990) 71-75, with plan). Fortifications: the acropolis, at the S end of the mod. town, was situated on two flat-topped hills joined Sy a saddle. This area was first fortified in the 6th Ct BC and rebuilt at least three times up to and including the Byz period, when the town was restricted to the N slopes below it. The extended circuit was founded early in the 4th Ct BC, and was mostly in isodomic trapezoidal masonry of the local grey limestone, the blocks being either hammer-dressed or retaining the quarried face. From the E end of the acropolis, the E leg of the circuit wall ran due N along the W bank of a ravine. At the W end of the acropolis, the W part of the circuit ran N, then W (this stretch has 11 visible rectangular towers), N again and then E, forming a loop to enclose various defensive heights, before turning N to run parallel with the E wall. Once fairly down on the plain both the W and E walls turned inwards towards each other, so that the N part of the circuit was triangular or trapezoidal in plan (no remains of the northernmost part of the walls have been found). In 1988, on Ag. Paraskeve hill, a 43m stretch of the W wall was found. In the B. Tourmousoglou plot SW of Palama St, was one of the rectangular towers with parts of the wall to both S and N. The wall continued N over Palama, into the plot of B.H. Gakas and the one immediately E of it, jointly owned by B. Beliokas and Ch. Notes. Here the wall was interrupted by a postern gate (gate 2), 2m wide, but with the width of the actual opening reduced to 1.30m by narrow jambs on either side. The tower, ca 18m S of it, would have threatened the right, unshielded, side of any approaching enemy, and the gate gave convenient access to the Apidanos Spring just outside the walls. Ca 100m NE of the postern gate, in the plot of A. Maliachovas, was found another gate (gate 1), possibly the main gate to the lower city, protected by a rectangular tower immediately to its S. The angle this gate and tower formed with another tower about 30m to the SW, in the middle of Thetidos St., proved that the W wall turned NE towards the E wall and extended northwards. The gate was 4.1m wide, and settings for the door-jambs and pivot-holes proved that it was closed by a double door flush with its W, outer face. It is the largest extant gate in the walls. Though the road which ran from it has not yet been located, it would have passed through the extensive W cemetery of anc. Pharsala a short distance away. Part of the E wall of the city and remains of a tower were found in the Stergiopoulos plot on Athenas 154. The wall was 2.50m wide and this section of it, which ran SSE to NNW, was where the E wall was just starting to turn inwards towards the W wall. There was a postern gate (gate 3), discovered earlier, about 40m to the SSE of it. HL and Ott Houses. In the Tsoumanes plot at the cross- road formed by Athenas and Chondropoulou, sporadic remains of several Ott buildings representing at least two building phases were found. From the second phase came a large number of clay tobacco pipes. At a lower level, remains of three HL houses were discovered. Two were vestigial, but the third, House A, was of considerable interest. The preserved wall foundations, .45-.50m wide and of unworked stones and occasional reused blocks bonded with mud, ran N-S and E-W. Floors were of clay or beaten earth. In the SW was an andron, entered through its E wall via a marble threshold which once had double doors which opened inwards. E of the andron was a porch, possibly roofed, which led directly to an open courtyard area to the N, approximately rectangular, but wider at its E end, which was provided with a marble drain to collect rain water. N of the courtyard were stubs of walls running N-S which had divided the area into three rooms. In the courtyard was an oval apothetes which had also been a household shrine. It was 5.10-6.55m in diameter and .67m in depth. It was lined with unworked stones, laid diagonally so that the base of the pit was smaller than the top. Set in it was the base of a small marble votive stele; the stele itself was found about .55m to the NNE of the apothetes. Within the pit were many clay figurines, both intact and broken, a few iron nails, two small bronze strips, a curved lead object, a few animal bones and a very small quantity of charcoal. Almost all the figurines portrayed reclining female forms wearing a crown or polos. Other similar fragments were found in the fill of the house. Local comparanda dated them to the late 6th-early 5th Cts BC and proved them to have been connected with the worship of Demeter. A small marble altar was set against the N wall of the courtyard. Beneath the E wall of the house was a circumscribed area of burning in which were four small vessels, three set upside-down and one upright. It was appar- ently a foundation deposit. From the general fill of the house came HL figurines, a few bronze coins of Pharsala, Larisa and Antigonos Gonatas, and much pottery-pithoi, skyphoi, pans, plates, tear-flasks, lamps etc. (ADelt 43) Pythio Elassonas. While ploughing his field 100m S of Ag. Apostoloi hill on which anc. Pythio is situated, I. Skretos turned up many fragments of votive inscriptions and two pithoi. According to reliable information this was the place where dedications to Patroos Poseidon were earlier found, and this, together with other surface evidence, indicated that the temple, famous throughout Perrhaibia, was somewhere in this vicinity. Because of difficult circumstances, it was only possible to collect surface finds and investigate the two pithoi, which had been looted, but contained a little HL pottery. (ADelt 43) CENTRAL MACEDONIA (16th Ephorate) The Ephorate's chief task of rescue excavations received strong financial support in 1988 from the Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace. In December of the same year the second annual conference on both systematic and rescue excavations in Macedonia and Thrace took place in Thessalonike, and the volume containing the communications from the 1987 meeting (AEMTH 1, 1987) appeared, prepared and edited by the staff of the 16th Ephorate. In 1988 the Ephorate was also involved in the organisation and presentation of no fewer than eight exhibitions, all bilingual. In February the Thessalonike Museum was host to an exhibition from Thessalonike's sister- city Bologna, entitled 'Bologna: the Etruscans of the North'. In 41</page><page sequence="42">42 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 18 return an exhibition was sent from Thessalonike Museum illustrating 'Macedonia from the Mycenaean Years to Alexander the Great'; this was opened in Bologna in April as part of the celebrations for the 900th anniversary of the foundation of the University of Bologna. It was very well received, and there was such demand for it to travel to other Italian cities, that the photographic section of the exhibition was displayed in July in the village of Calimera, in the area of Apulia where the formerly Greek-speaking population retains a special tie with Greece. On its return from Bologna, the exhibition was on view for two months in Thessalonike Museum. After this, enriched by finds from W and E Macedonia and the co-operation of the respective Ephorates, it travelled to Australia under the title of 'Ancient Macedonia'. It was opened in Melbourne on 26th November by the then President of Greece Chr. Sartzetakes, and afterwards toured some of the other major Australian cities. In October and November, two exhibitions were mounted in Thessalonike Museum with the collaboration of the Goethe Institute of Thessalonike, one on 'New Museums in the Federal German Republic' and the other exhibiting Greek drawings of the traveller G.M. Von Wagner in 1812-13. A final exhibition entitled 'A Century of Archaeology in Greater Greece' was presented in the Museum in collaboration with the Italian Cultural Institute, the University of Naples and the Institute for the History and Archaeology of Greater Greece, Taranto. Axioupolis. Two bronze pendants, six bronze biconical beads, four decorated ephelides and a lid from a pyxis-pendant, which were from EIA tombs, were found in a conduit and handed in to Kilkis museum. (ADelt 43) Chalkidike: Ierissos (cemetery of anc. Akanthos, AR 1993-94, 51). In 1988 part of a building plot, 12 x 16m, was excavated in the E part of the cemetery. 401 tombs were found, thickly packed in successive strata, to a depth of ca 2.50m. They dated from the end of C to the R periods. The burials were disturbed and not in the usual chronological order; there were indications that older tombs had been destroyed so that the area could be reused. The burials were chiefly inhumations in pit graves dug into the sand; the dead were probably on wooden biers, the nails of which survived. Inhumations also occurred in tile graves, pithoi, sarcophagi, while urn burials of children, usually in amphoras, were extremely common. The few cremations had taken place within the clay-lined tombs in which they were found. Most of the dead were laid extended on their backs with their heads approximately E, but in a few pit graves, they were on their faces with their heads to the W. Many of the graves had no funerary offerings, and generally the finds were not rich. An exception was a female burial in a pit grave dating to the second half of the 4th Ct BC. This contained a gold ring with an engraved Nike, a necklace of gold beads and lions- head earrings. Finds generally comprised the following: pots, chiefly undecorated or bg (skyphoi, kantharoi etc), notable was part of a late 5th Ct BC rf pot depicting warriors; figurines; bronze coins; bronze and bone small objects and jewellery-- among these a double flute of bone and a gilded bronze diadem with plant decoration were outstanding. (ADelt 43) Kalandra (anc. Mende) (AR 1992-93, 54). ADelt 43 Chr, 361 carries a brief account of the 1988 season of the systematic excavation being conducted at this important Chalkidic city by the Ephor J. Vocotopoulou. The stratigraphical test by the sea shore reached 4.50m depth and a LPG floor; the pottery incl- uded a plastic animal leg, reminiscent of that of the Lefkandi centaur. With the stratigraphical test as a guide, a large adjacent area was opened. In its uppermost stratum was an avenue, 8.5m wide, bordered by houses. House A, to the W, was excavated and dated to 375-350 BC by bg pottery and a number of bronze coins. Below the road surface were spas- modic 5th Ct BC building remains, and below these the walls of the Archaic house B, where an Ionian kylix of 575-550 BC was found. Another test on the summit of Deligiannides Hill uncovered two semi-basement rooms of the 4th Ct BC, partly cut into the bedrock. Storage pits and wine amphorase con- firmed their use as storage areas. Tests in the beach in front of the Hotel Mende located the first funerary pithoi in the cemetery. This season is more extensively covered and very well-illustrated in AEMTH 2,(1988) 331-7. Post-1988 seasons are in AEMTH 3 (1989), 409-18; 4 (1990), 411-23. Nea Roda, Xerxes' Canal (Fig. 18). This year's pro- gramme was determined by the results of the study of data obtained in last year's field work. The combination of geo- physical investigations with deep core drilling at the location of traverse D1/D2 had then indicated the presence there of a deeply buried canal containing a substantial muddy fill. It seemed desirable to test whether the same features could be detected by the same combination of methods-geophysical investigations and core drilling (Fig. 19)-in other locations, and whether they were thus of more than local significance. Nikete: Ag. Giannes (AR 1990-91, 49). Part of this known cemetery, which is being gradually converted to a camping ground by the community of Nikete, was tested in 1988. Eighteen trenches produced remains of a 5th Ct BC building founded on top of a stratum with tombs. Forty-five tombs were excavated, thickly packed in two successive strata in sandy or marshy ground. Only five of the graves were cremations, while 40 were pithos burials, their mouths closed by schist lids; they had no fixed orientation. Three of the pithoi had an oval peribolos built round them and one of these had three granite cover slabs. Each pithos held at least two skeletons, which suggests they may have been family tombs. Most were child-</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 Fig. 19 burials, four of which had the appropriate jugs with feeding spouts. Bronze spectacle fibulae, bracelets and biconical beads, and spindle whorls were typical fin'ds. With some reservations, the first impression was that the tombs dated to the later phase of the EIA, ca 900-750 BC. (ADelt 43) Polychrono. On the east coast of Cassandra, the construc- tion of a Forestry Dept. road in 1987 struck remains of an A-C settlement and parts of its cemetery. Two walls, probably terrace walls on the steep hillside by the road, were very well built. The fill connected with them contained pottery of the 5th and 4th Cts BC; they were apparently abandoned at the end of the 4th Ct BC. 18 tombs were excavated, chiefly urn burials, but also tile graves and cist graves which were usually covered with stone piles. The finds, chiefly small pots and figurines, were placed both inside and outside the tombs. A first impres- sion was that the cemetery was used from the end of the 6th to the 4th Cts BC. The locally-made funerary urns with stylized plant decoration provided valuable evidence for the develop- ment of Chalkidic pottery. Two pyre areas which had seen successive use were of great interest in a cemetery in which all the burials were inhumations. They contained only a little bone but much broken burnt pottery; they may have been connected with worship of the dead. (ADelt 43) The 1988 season was more extensively reported and illustrated in AEMTH 2 (1988), 317-23 and the 1989 season in AEMTH 3 (1989), 391-8. Polygyros: Kastri. During the construction of the new national highway from Thessalonike to Polygyros, two cist tombs were found on the E slopes of Kastri Hill, 3km NW of Polygiros. The tombs were cut into the cist bedrock and had large cover slabs of the same material. In 1971, two similar tombs a very short distance away were destroyed by a mechan- ical excavator. These had rich finds of the 6th-5th Cts BC (pots, bronze jewellery, iron weapons). The two 1988 tombs were both female burials. One contained a diadem in the form of a decorated silver band, a lozenge-shaped silver mouth cover, a pair of silver ear-rings each consisting of a small and a large hoop, a silver and a bronze ring, a pair of silver bracelets, a skyphos, a two-handled pyxis with its cover, and remains of an iron pin. The other burial had four bronze biconical beads, a pair of bronze earrings, a fibula, beads, a trefoil-lipped oinochoe and a pot of skyphos type. All four tombs date to the same period, and belong to the as yet unknown settlement which once existed on the hill of Kastri. (ADelt 43) Sarti: Platanitsi. The Sarti community's camping beach, Platanitsi, 3km N of the town on the E coast of Sithonia, has a stream running through it, and in the sand near its mouth a thick stratum of roof tiles in a burnt layer became visible. The brief excavation which followed uncovered a kiln for roof tiles, many of which had red or black coating. The kiln was approxi- mately piriform in outline with walls of layers of tiles which formed a sort of dromos leading to the stoke-hole. The vaulted roof, built of rectangular bricks, had collapsed upon the perforated floor of the firing chamber. The excavation, which was not completed, produced no evidence for the kiln's date. (ADelt 43) Stageira. The Press report that 800m of the perimeter wall have been cleared, together with part of the acropolis. Public and private buildings discovered include a stoa (5th Ct BC) in the agora. Solenas Kallitheas. Solenas is a pine-covered hill just N of the Hotel Pallene-Athos, S of Kallithea, on the E coast of Cassandra. In 1988 the remains of a Macedonian tomb and its tumulus were located on the S slopes of the hill. Its architec- tural members were scattered round the area. Only its NE corner and parts of the two couches within it remained in situ. The walls were preserved to a height of .60m and had been of isodomic masonry. The floor had been paved with large stone slabs. Remains of the S wall's foundations show the length of the chamber to have been 3.40m. The few finds-fragments of an iron strigil, a bronze vessel, gilded clay beads and sherds of a bg kantharos with ribbed decoration on the body-date the tomb to the last quarter of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 43) An extended discussion of the tomb by E.-B. Tsigarida is published in AEMTH 3 (1989), 373-8. Torone. Electronic survey of the general area of the excavations was carried out. Results are not yet complete, but they show especially that at the isthmus between headlands 1 and 2, a large wall was located which it is believed belongs to the EBA or EIA. Underwater investigations looked at the seabed E of Lekythos, the fortified headland known from Thucydides. In an area 50 x 100m in the middle of the sea were seen remains of buildings, bearing firm witness to a marked change in the line of the coast from antiquity to the present day. Cherso. From this locality (ca 14km NW of Kilkis), from which there had been earlier indications of ancient remains, a fragmentary funerary stele with the head of a male form was handed in to Kilkis museum. Part of the top of the stele was preserved and bore a representation of a stylized flower. (ADelt 43) Dibouno-Gerikari. In this district (15km NE of Kilkis), a known archaeological area, a male statue of the R period with a short chiton and himation was found. (ADelt 43) Dion. Press reports include details of a 1st Ct AD tombstone, with Latin inscription, depicting a musical instrument, a nabla. Kaballari. (Langada basin, 3km SW of Langada). On a low rise S of the village of Kaballari, a small toumba was located in 1988. Its NE slopes had been destroyed by antiquities thieves, and in the sides of their pits could be seen strong stone structures and successive settlement strata. Trial trenches were set out on the undisturbed parts of the toumba summit. A strongly-built wall of unworked stones was found, ca im in width and visible for a 10m length. In the middle of it was a gate opening, 2.50m wide and flanked by two bastions. A later 43</page><page sequence="44">44 R. A. TOMLINSON addition had narrowed the entrance to 0.95m. The wall was part of a defensive circuit belonging to the latest settlement, provisionally dated to the EIA. The large stone structures seen in the section of the robbers' pit could not be connected with this wall, but LBA pottery from the deeper strata suggests that this was a fortified settlement first occupied then, which continued into the EIA. (ADelt 43) A fuller report is published by M. Pappa in AEMTH 3 (1989), 331-8. Kalamaria. The Press report excavations of a settlement, houses of 6th and 5th Cts BC and a cemetery which includes the burial of a small horse. It is suggested that this may be the ancient Therme. Kitros: Alykes (anc. Pydna S. Cemetery) (AR 1992-93, 56). In 1988 M. Besios continued the excavation of a tumulus started in 1984, and continued in 1986. Three cist tombs and three pit graves were investigated, which confirmed the original conclusions. The tumulus was that of a family of hetairoi who buried their dead here from the mid-4th to the end of the 2nd Cts BC. In the second half of the 4th Ct burials were in individual cist and pit graves, which had white or coloured plaster interiors. The single-chambered Macedonian tomb was built at the end of the 4th/beginning of the 3rd Cts BC and received the members of the family, with the exception of small children, from then on. Single burials of adults outside it started again about the middle of the 2nd Ct BC. The three 1988 cist tombs had very rich finds. The corpse in T.13 was on a bier decorated with glass, ivory and gilded silver strips; gilded beads of both bronze and clay may have been from it also; other finds were two iron strigils and a clay amphora. The tomb was dated to the second half of the 4th Ct BC. A little girl in T.14, whose grave had a red and yellow interior, was accompanied by gold ear-rings, siver coins, a gilded bronze wreath, many knuckle-bones (astragaloi), a rf squat lekythos, bg pottery, and figurines with the original colours well- preserved; this burial also belonged to the second half of the 4th Ct BC. T. 12, again a child burial, dating to the first half of the 3rd Ct BC, contained two gold diadems with plant decora- tion, two gold bracelets, clay figurines, iron strigils, a small clay skyphos and knucklebones. (ADelt 43) An extended report of the 1988 season has appeared in AEMTH 2 (1988), 181-93. Kitro: Alykes (anc. Pydna) (AR 1991-92, 44). Excavations continued to uncover extensive stretches of the fortification walls (E and MByz phases) on the site of the Byz castle. (ADelt 43) Kolchida (AR 1991-92, 44-45). Excavation of remains to the north of the ECh complex took place. A wall 1.80m thick and 16.70m long, made of irregular stones, broken pottery and poor-quality mortar was located, along with a few small ancillary structures. The settlement was fortified in the 5th Ct AD and may have been destroyed in the late 6th according to coin finds (Tiberios 579/80) and a destruction phase (?) in the wall just mentioned. (ADelt 43) Makrygialos (anc. Pydna) (AR 1993-94, 52). N cemetery. In 1988 M. Besios completed the excavation in plot 937, begun in 1987. 50 tombs of the second half of the 4th Ct BC were investigated. They were organized in groups, probably repre- senting individual families. Most were pit graves which had once had wooden covers. They usually had roomy chambers to accomodate the bier, but children were buried in wooden coffins. One separate group consisted of three child cremations in pit graves. A trial excavation was begun in plot 947, in the centre of the N cemetery. Pit graves were located and one with the burial of a small girl was excavated. Gold, bronze and iron jewellery were found, together with bg pottery and three large wg lekythoi dating to the last quarter of the 5th Ct BC. (ADelt 43) An extended report of this season, with a general plan and plans and sections of individual tombs, has appeared in AEMTH 2 (1988), 181-93. Mandres. (14km S of Kilkis.) During the demolition of an old oven from the 1920s refugee period, part of an inscribed funerary stele was found built into it. The lower legs of four forms wearing himatia were preserved, plus a three-line inscription: EYFENEIA AOYKIQ TO ANAPI KAI E / AYTH KAI TOIX TEKNOIX MNHMHE XAPIN / ETOYE AIIP. It was taken to Kilkis museum. (ADelt 43) Nea Philadelphia. The Press report discovery of the burial of a warrior in a sarcophagus, ca 480 BC. Olympos: Petra (Treis Elies) (AR 1993-94, 53). As one of a series of excavations investigating cemeteries of the late LBA- EIA in the Olympos area, in 1988 E. Pantermalie opened trenches on this pine-covered hill near Petra on the N slopes of the mountain. A cemetery transitional in period between the LBA and the EIA was discovered, provisionally dated to the 11th Ct BC. Forty-one tombs were excavated, of which the greater number had been destroyed either by thieves or by cultivation in early periods before the forest took over the hill. It was a flat cemetery (without tumuli), with stone slab cist tombs or pit graves with stone slab covers. These usually contained only one burial, either extended or contracted. Grave goods were chiefly pottery and jewellery. Wheel-made pottery followed the Myc tradition, while hand-made pottery often imitated its forms. The most common shape was the cut-away- necked jug. (ADelt 43) A fuller, illustrated account of the excavation has appeared in AEMTH 2 (1988), 174-7. Ossa. (15km NE of Langadas; AR 1993-94, 53.) In 1988 P. Adam-Veleni undertook the systematic excavation of this small HL mountain settlement in anc. Bisaltia, which was discovered during road construction and briefly tested in 1987. Ten 4 x 4m trenches were opened on the summit of the hill. After successive EIA habitation levels, a settlement of unknown size was founded in the latter half of the 4th Ct BC. About the middle of the 3rd Ct BC it was destroyed, probably by fire. It was immediately rebuilt on the same orientation as before, but the overall plan was more advanced, probably to serve the needs of an increased population; regular organisation of the area on a grid system was very clear in this phase. The phase lasted about a century, and during it, in the first half of the 2nd Ct BC, the fortification wall discovered in 1987 was built. A narrow road was left between its inner face and the houses, to allow free circulation within the citadel. By the 1st Ct BC however, the road had been built over, presumably owing to a further population increase. (ADelt 43) A full, illustrated report on this season appears in AEMTH 2 (1988), 231-7).

Savvopoulou reports on the 1988 season of her systematic</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 45 excavation at this important EIA cemetery site. In the lowest level of the EIA cemetery an intact peribolos and three funerary platform-shaped structures were found. Ash urns and R tombs continued to appear, as in previous seasons. In the wider area between Palaio and Neo Gynaikokastro, three cist tombs were located and excavated, which on the basis of their construction and finds, were also judged to be EIA. (ADelt 43) A full, illustrated, report on this season was published in AEMTH 2 (1988) 219-23. Platamon. There were Press reports of rescue excavations of cemeteries dating from N to R, resulting from the doubling of the railway and national road; they include a N cemetery S of Makrigiali covering 700 stremmata. Sindos: Toumba Agios Athanasios. (20km from Thessalo- nike.) Several tombs (some unrobbed) were found in excava- tions. Most significant is a splendid Macedonian tomb with a Doric facade, described in press reports as a 'new Vergina'. It has outstanding painted decoration, including a continuous frieze, depicting a symposion, on the lower part of the archi- trave. The style of some of the figures (soldiers with spears and shields) recall the Boscoreale fresco of a philosopher and a prince with his mother, and confirms a Macedonian original for the fresco. (Colour photographs with a report in Kathemer- ine 5.2.95). During construction work on fuel stores for NATO immediately N of the double tables of Sindos-Nea Anchialos (Inglis) in 1988, the southern part of the C cemetery belonging to the settlement on the Tables was discovered. Forty-nine tombs were excavated (2 urn burials, a clay larnax, a stone sarcophagus, 12 plain pit graves and 32 cist graves built of mud bricks), dating mid 5th-mid 4th Cts BC. The grave goods (chiefly pots, a few weapons, jewellery, figurines etc) did not suggest a continuation of the prosperity of the A settlement and its cemetery to the S, but it is very likely that these particular graves had an exclusively family character. (ADelt 43) S. Moschonisiotou discusses and illustrates this cemetery more fully in AEMTH 2 (1988), 286-9. Stavrochori. (8km NW of Kilkis.) The head of a statue of a child which came from an unknown site in this area was handed in to Kilkis museum. (ADelt 43) Terpyllos. (8km NE of Kilkis.) Three bronze bracelets and two bronze rings from this area were handed in to Kilkis museum. (ADelt 43) Thermi. Polytechneiou-Gr. Lambrake (Plot 377 O.T. 76): mechanical excavation for foundations on the plot at the junction of these two roads brought to light part of an A-EC cemetery, almost certainly connected with the settlement on the table of Sedes-Thermi, a short distance away. There were indications that the cemetery extended well beyond the excavation. In two months in 1988 a third of the plot (1,582 m2) was investigated and 91 tombs were found. Forty-eight were pit graves, covered with schist slabs; they often had small unworked stones and pebbles round their sides; 32 were cist graves of poros, schist or mud bricks set vertically, the two latter types being used exclusively in children's graves; two were poros sacophagi and two were pithos burials. The orientation of the tombs was E-W. Women had their heads to the E and men to the W, as in other contemporary cemeteries in the area. Many of the tombs had been disturbed and looted, the practice beginning in antiquity. Most male burials were accompanied by weapons, usually iron spearheads and daggers. Swords were rarer, while only two helmets, of the Illyrian type, were found. The most usual pots were kraters, (amongst them a Chalcidic one with plant decoration), kylikes, kotyles and exaleiptra. Female jewellery was usually of bronze, with silver and gold occurring more rarely; skyphoi and exaleiptra were the most popular vases. Children were usually accompanied by jewellery, and also clay figurines, female protomes etc. Special mention is made of two Egyptian scarabs with hieroglyphics of the 16th dynasty, two silver coins of Alexander I and Chalcidic Dikaia, and quite a number of lozenge-shaped gold mouth covers. The cemetery was in use from the end 6th-end 5th Cts BC with isolated istances of burials to the mid 4th Ct BC. Indications of paths, groups of tombs and remains of piles of stones (as markers) show an attempt to organize the cemetery area, while the finds indicate commercial connections with Athens and Corinth. (ADelt 43) The cemetery was excavated by K. Lazaridou and S. Moschonisiotou, and the latter has provided a fuller, illustrated, report in AEMTH 2 (1988), 283-6. Thessalonike. The Press report the discovery of a clay theatrical tragic mask in excavations behind the Central Hospital. Excavations also continued in the Plateia Dioikitiriou, where an underground car park is being constructed. Dis- coveries included the remains of a Byz glass manufactory. Nine rescue excavations took place in 1988. Two were within the ancient walls, one was in the E cemetery, two in the W cemetery, and four were in today's suburbs, their connection with the ancient city tenuous to non-existent. Within the walls, in a plot at Karbola 9-Makedonikes Amynes 5, SW of the excavated R agora, a continuation of the agora was found. It was part of the plateia, paved with rectangular marble slabs. It had been considerably disturbed by a Byz cistern built in its NW part, and by post-Byz wells, pits and walls. A test below the pavement reached a floor at a depth of 6.50m with a shallow pit dating to the late HL period. After the announcement of plans to build a car park beneath Plateia Dioiketeriou, tests were made beneath neigh- bouring footpaths to a depth of 3.50m. Many R to post-Byz walls and wells were encountered. In the E Cemetery, in the grounds of the International Exhibition, and to the SE of the OTE tower, another under- ground car park proposal required a rescue excavation. Below 1.50m of later fill, the 21 trenches brought to light a number of tombs, chiefly pit graves. In the limited investigation which followed, six pit graves with remains of wooden biers, a tile grave, a cist grave lined with small stones and plaster and a possible urn burial were excavated. The burials were without grave goods with the exception of the built cist, which con- tained a glass unguentarium. In the W Cemetery, at the junction of Langada-Ag. Demetriou, sewerage works struck and partly destroyed three tombs-two plastered mud-brick cists and a cooking-pot ash urn set in the pyre area. There was no dating evidence. During council roadworks in Geo. Ivanoff in the inner suburb of Xerokrene, further S in the W cemetery, a mono- lithic marble sarcophagus was discovered 2m below the surface. Only its W end could be cleared for fear of undermin- ing the foundations of adjacent buildings. The gabled cover of the sarcophagus was decorated with four acroteria. On the NW acroterion a female form holding a swan and a thyrsos (?) was carved in low relief, with a dog on her left. Within the tomb, which had been robbed, were a few bones, R sherds, and frag- ments of iron.</page><page sequence="46">46 R. A. TOMLINSON In the E of the modem city, at Sebasteias 8 in Kalamaria, building activities disclosed a tile grave without grave goods. It may have belonged to an A (?) cemetery known to have existed in the surrounding area. K. Soueref continued his work in building plots in the NE of the city, on the table of the Toumba for which the suburb of Ano Toumba is named. At Ortansias 4, previously investigated in 1986, the excavation was extended. As in the previous excavations here and in the neighbouring plot at Ortansias 6 (1985), the stratigraphy consisted of: EIA and EA pottery in the earliest building phase; a wide level of destruction associ- ated with pottery of the second half of the 6th Ct BC in the second building phase; three more successive phases of the 5th and 4th Cts BC. At Dryos 9 on the W extremity of the Toumba table, two tests were set out. They showed: remains of mud-brick buildings and EIA pottery; a sterile level of sand and gravel deposited by a torrent; a level of the A and C years with remains of successive stone-walled buildings. Well to the W of the city centre, at Monasteriou 246, building operations uncovered remains at a depth of 2.50- 4.50m below present road level. E. Trakosopoulou-Salakidou identified them as the 'lost' Macedonian tomb of the 5th kilometer on Monasteriou, which dated to the second half of the 3rd Ct BC. The tomb was originally covered by a conical mound, first excavated in 1864 by a French mission which did not locate the monument. In 1919 English archaeologists undertook the excavation which brought to light the ready-to- fall temple-like Doric facade and part of the roof. It was shored up temporarily, but the excavation was never continued (BSA 23 (1918-19), 40, P1. 12). Most of the upper part of the building was removed at an unknown time, probably during building operations. As rediscovered, hardly more than the ground-plan of the tomb was preserved. It was oriented SW- NE, with the entrance in the SW. There were two chambers, a porch measuring 2 x 3.50m and a main chamber 4.50 x 3.50m. The floor was paved with well-fitted poros slabs, unfortunately mostly under water. The walls had only survived at foundation level except in the S comer, where the internal wall face retained plaster painted to imitate marble panelling. The remaining lower portions of the Doric semi-columns in the facade certified the tomb's identification. The monument was protected and preserved under fill. (ADelt 43) Reports for 1988 include many of LR to Ott remains that were uncovered. Among the most interesting were: excavations on the site of the old Chortiati Stoa on Egnatias-M. Genadiou Sts uncovered two main buildings along with a stretch of a previously unknown R road running N to S. The first LR structure, built with alternating layers of bricks and stones, had been destroyed and filled. A coin of Anastasios I (498-518) from this level established the building's terminus ante quem. Coin finds from this later layer included both MByz and LByz coins found in burial contexts, an indication that this area, unlike the agora, was in constant use right up till Ott times. The second structure is probably MByz, and shows signs of successive repairs and modifications. It would seem that both structures lay within the insula defined by the Via Regia and the Cardo. The MByz remains may be associated with nearby remains of the 10 Ct Prodromou, or Leontiou monastery (found in 1933), which was one of the first religious houses to be transformed into a mosque in the 1430. (ADelt 43) Outside the walls, on 93 Monastiriou St., remains of a Byz pottery workshop were uncovered at a depth of 3.50m. The stratigraphy showed that the two-chamber kiln showed evi- dence of heavy use over a long period of time. (ADelt 43) Three finely-built vaulted chamber tombs (two with steps leading into them) were found at 3 Bas. Olgas St with painted decoration, including a foliate cross. (ADelt 43) Remains of a richly oramented (opus sectile floor) LR triclinium (9m wide x 9m ext. width) were discovered at 5 Prof. Ilias St. (ADelt 43) The vaulted cruciform crypt (10.9 x 9.1m) of a MByz monastery church (?) was discovered in good condition at 12 Byzantinos St. in the Old City. A double passageway leading from the south wall to a unknown destination was also found. Foundations of the narthex and part of the nave were also uncovered, along with other much ruined remains. The site has been officially declared an historical monument. The excavations of the city walls at Tsimiske and Philikes Etaireias (AR 1993-94, 53) continued to find extensive founda- tions of the outer wall, and sections of towers, parts of which had been discovered in previous seasons. (ADelt 43) Karabournaki. Under the Auspices of the Ephorate of Underwater Archaeology, in 1988 E. Spondyles investigated the bay at Karaboumaki which has been identified as the Byz harbour known as Kellarion. Parallel to the coast were dis- covered two barriers of beach rock, the inshore one with its base 2-2.50m below sea level and its top ca 70m below the surface and the seaward one with its base 5m below the surface and its top 4m below. The inner barrier was 1.5km in length, extending from the Poseidonios swimming pool to Karabourn- aki Point with the light-house. In the same vicinity, below the light-house, a wall 25m long and .70m wide, built of unworked pieces of local greenstone bonded with lime plaster, could be discerned. The presence of the inshore barrier of beach rock in particular indicates the possibility of the bay's having been used as a harbour for light craft during the Byz period.

Mosaic floors with geometric designs were uncovered. Excavations will continue to establish the precise nature of the complex. (ADelt 43) Pella. The Press reports that excavations in the E cemetery (and elsewhere) have been carried out, partly because of the never-ending threat of illicit digging. This has resulted in the discovery of some interesting and important tombs, here and in the adjacent region, which have featured in prominent press reports. Particularly worthy of note are: first, a built cist tomb ca 10 x 5m, mid 4th Ct BC, with a burial on a wooden couch (this represents an interesting stage in the development of Macedonian tombs, immediately before they were constructed with vaults); second, a Macedonian tomb 7.0 x 4.80m, with an Ionic facade, consisting of two pairs of columns to either side of the doorway, set in wider space, architecturaly a most unusual arrangement. The entablature is of standard type, with a dentil, but not a continuous frieze. A date towards the end of the 4th Ct looks likely. The tomb was subsequently used for secondary burials, presumably as a family mausoleum. Several other Macedonian tombs are reported from Pella, and at Giannitsa and Thessalonike (qv.). Loutaki.

Remains of a domed, three-apsed church of the Metamorphosis NE of Lake Kastoria have been dated to 1000, and have been marked for further excavation and possible reconstruction. (ADelt 43) Veroia. Excavations E of the 15th Ct church of St Ann revealed traces of buildings associated with it. Excavation of an upper layer uncovered an undatable earlier three-aisle basilica associated with a marble floor (red hexagonal plaques alternating with small white squares). Deeper levels revealed a complex of earlier structures, including an apse on the same orientation as both the church of St Ann and the basilica. Scattered fragments of a mosaic floor were found in association with the apse on the earliest level, pointing to an ECh date. An even earlier, undated structure must have existed, judging from the drains found in the level below the ECh basilica. (ADelt 43) A tomb chanced upon by a bulldozer in the former R and LR cemetery (Ionos St.) may date from the 4th Ct, in which case the paintings found therein are highly significant: W wall: enthroned Christ amongst flowers flanked by a woman and man (traces only) in postures of supplication, and at a smaller scale. The N wall contains paintings of large birds, while the S depicts a youthful figure in a landscape of flowers and birds. This extremely important work was immediately removed for conservation to the workshops of the 11th Byzantine Ephorate, and wall-painting fragments were collected from the site. Zaborda monastery, Grebena. Wall-paintings in a cave hermitage close to the 16th Ct monastery are dated to the 15th Ct (apse: Theotokos, Melismos, bishops and full-length saints) and the 13th Ct (S wall: full-length saints).

Ioannides plot in the present village was covered in wash 1.50 -5m deep. Below this, walls and wall foundations, part of a clay-tiled floor with a limited area of burning on it, and a well with a stone-built top were uncovered, all probably belonging to the one establishment (?dwelling). In the fill were found much bg and West Slope pottery, many amphora sherds and stamped handles, a few rf Attic sherds, parts of a bf Panathenaic amphora, many fragments of clay figurines and protomes, iron and bronze nails and strips, several types of loomweights, broken lamps, and parts of various marble objects, giving a general date of mid 4th-mid 3rd Cts BC. The excavation of the A. Bikos plot, begun in 1987, was completed. The plot is on the slope of the hill W of the archaeological site. Six widely-dispersed trenches yielded building remains and pottery ranging from late 4th Ct BC to R. (ADelt 43) Ch.

(ADelt 43) Dikili Tash. Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthake reports in Ergon on her work in 1994. The traces of four dwellings of the Chalkoli- thic period were planned. They all had the same orientation, and were separated by spaces which were interpreted as roads. They face NE-SW, and are arranged as steps in the side of the hill where the PR settlement was found. The buildings were of compacted mud, the walls reinforced with branches, and the roofs were of reed, with a thick covering of mud. The fire which destroyed the buildings consolidated the clay of the walls, which was found in fragments, defining on the floors the edge of the areas formerly roofed. In the area of building 1, spreads of stones were uncovered, once surrounded by wooden posts which no longer survive. The stones were used for the reinforcement of the posts. In the space between buildings 1 and 2 trenches were found into which the inhabitants had thrown their rubbish. It was confirmed that building 4 was divided into three sections, two of almost equal size, the third smaller. The two larger had doors on the NE side, and on the inside a small oven with a domed roof. By the ovens were clay vessels used for the preparation of bread. On the floor of building 4 were pots, some of them decorated, and small finds, figurines, tools, ornaments and sling stones.</page><page sequence="48">48 R. A. TOMLINSON Kalamonas Dramas.

Part of a cobbled floor and the latest phase of the altar were found, also a cobbled area immediately S of the temple. In the temple prodromos, entered from the W, the destruction level of the A phase was encountered, dating to end 6th-beginning 5th Cts BC. Sherds of Attic bf kylikes of this date were numerous.

Sande reports on the continuation of the Norwegian research at the Byzantine fortress of Petropege: "Inside the fortress excavation was carried out in three trenches to establish the plan and building history of the central construction, probably a 'hani' or inn. The building turned out to be much larger than at first presumed: to the W it joins the external wall of the fortress. Foundations still carrying a low line of bricks between the E wall of the building and the fortress wall suggest that the same was planned here, but not executed-probably because it was preferred to have one open passage between the N and S part of the surrounding court. Remaining portions of the external walls of the hani show quite careful work, with patterned surfaces in stone and brick and at least one lesena. An inner wall running in an E-W direction divides the interior into two long, narrow parallel rooms. In a trench immediately inside the SE gate two successive surfaces were identified, both consisting of stucco and com- pressed soil, the lower surface also with inclusions of pebbles; the upper surface is at the same level as the floors of the hani, and probably contemporary with it. The two phases in the external walls of the fortress, which were strengthened at a later time, probably coincide with the two surfaces. Some damage to the inner wall of the gate seems to be connected with two large trenches which had been opened in this area, perhaps by treasure hunters before the 16th Ct, since Turkish coins of that period have been found above them. The fortress must still have been used then, but the hani was probably destroyed, since C,4 tests of carbon collected well above its floor, and consequently later than its destruction, give dates in the early 15th Ct. This destruction may have taken place when Thrace and E Macedonia were conquered by the Turks in the 1370-80s. Another carbon sample, collected from the fortress walls, gives a date between 1275 and 1380, but it is not clear if the part of the walls where this was found belongs to the first or second stage of the building. Most likely the fortress was built in the 13th Ct, the walls being strengthened and the hani constructed some time in the 14th." Philippoi. In 1988 many chance finds were collected from this site, particularly from the cemeteries, the most important being part of a HL, probably votive, inscription with a list of names. (ADelt 43) Remains of what may have been a baptistery (now much altered) were discovered amongst the N ancillary rooms, E of the stairway of the Museum Basilica. Fragments of marble revetments and painted imitation marble were found, along with marble slab and opus sectile floors. The structure con- sisted of a font and a chamber for the catechumens, although these were much changed in MByz times (after the 10th Ct) when a wall divided the room for the catechumens into two, the smaller being converted into a chapel. This was destroyed by earthquake, and the old baptistery was converted into another chapel and now (12th Ct) may have served as a funerary chapel since burials were made in the now deserted MByz chapel. A small trench W of the S entrance to the narthex discovered more evidence for the atrium. Between the SE pier and the S outer wall of the atrium, a masonry crepido- ma served as the base for steps leading from the S stoa to the higher E stoa. Evidence was also found for the gallery level of the atrium. (ADelt 43) Pyrgoi Dramas: Ag. Demetriou. A cemetery, probably of C date, was located here. (ADelt 43) Siderokastron.

Salviat report: "The 1994 campaign had the aim of investigating the line of the fortification by the mediaeval fortress, and the connec- tion between the fortification and the sanctuary of Pythian Apollo. It was possible to define the junction, previously unknown, between the ancient curtain wall and the corner bastion situated NE of the Med fortress (for the plan, see Guide de Thasos, facing p 57). This bastion, built of large blocks of marble and resting on rock, was built at the same time as the curtain wall, ca 500. In the remains of the fill put behind the external facing blocks of the E wall, in contact with the rock, we found pottery dating exclusively to the end-7th to 6th Cts BC; on the base of a cup of the last quarter of the 6th Ct one could read the name 'Apollo'. This bastion was destroyed at a date which it was not possible to determine. The curtain was then rebuilt a little further in, on a shorter align- ment; the new wall, still preserved in a section of 12 courses, reused a number of archaic blocks. Later, the Med masonry was installed above this wall. To the W, and below the Med fortress we uncovered the W border of the terrace of the Pythion, as well as its NW and SW corners. The support walls, only a single block thick, were built in a system similar to that which can be seen in the terrace of the sanctuary of Athena. This work must be placed in relation with the construction of the rampart at the same period." F. Blonde, A. Muller and D. Mulliez report on excavation in the area on the NE of the agora (Valma property) (Fig. 20): "Work was concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the Passage of the Theoroi, towards the NE, (trenches XVIII-XIX (Fig. 21)) and in the passage itself, where we have essentially repeated the old excavations (trench XX (Figs. 22, 23, 24)).

Under the oldest Fig. 21</page><page sequence="50">50 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 24 Fig. 22 Fig. 23 of these floors we uncovered for a distance of about 6m the walls M6 and M7 previously exposed in part last year. The more recent (M6). orientated NE-SW, is a low terrace wall of irregular stonework, reinforced by a small stepped support. It holds back on the SE side a thick mass of large stones, without Fig. 25 any finds. On the NW side, the level related to this wall was achieved below the levelling of wall M7. This other wall, which was older, ran at an angle to wall M6, and with its return (Ml) defined an apparently more important terrace, at the bottom of the slope at the foot of the acropolis, and below the Artemision. Among the material recovered in the levels at the foot of this wall, we would note quite numerous fragments of 'paracolonial' pottery (7th Ct). We have not reached subsoil. The predecessors of the Passage of the Theoroi: the reopening of trenches carried out in the course of 50 years under the R paving of the passage itself has made it possible to study constructions which can only indicate the old links, and to discover new ones, and above all to study the stratigraphy. We must first of all point out that we were able to recover very little stratified material, where it was possible to enlarge the old excavations without displacing more of the</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 R paving. The combination of this with the results obtained from our own work in the immediate vicinity of the passage enable us to reconstruct, at least in its broad outlines, the complex history of this area. After a first examination, the main facts recovered are as follows: Wall Mll. The most ancient state is represented by wall Ml, which runs obliquely across the axis of the passage; it may prolong, with a change of direction, the substantial construction M4+M3 observed further E. In any case, these walls organize and divide up the area at the foot of the acropolis. Their orientation, and surface relief in the neighbour- hood, suggest that they are more than simple terrace walls. The early state of the gate passage and its immediate surroundings: in the second period M11 was pierced by an opening: the sides of this gate, edged by two parallel walls mark out a passage whose orientation matches exactly that of the walls AB and CD of the future Passage of the Theoroi. For this gate passage one can observe or restore several states and arrangements which succeed each other during the course of the 6th Ct BC. The first passage is formed by walls M9 (or its first state) and M15 (perhaps extended by M8). The passage is thus 2.90m wide, the floor at the side ca 1.4m. In the second passage M9 survives, while parallel to it M13 replaces M15. In this new passage, a series of successive floor levels enable us to distinguish a series of three phases. The Passage of the Theoroi is the final improvement to this gate, but also the most monumental. Thanks to the partial demolition of walls M9 and M13, the new passage, created around 480-470 (a traditional dating, yet to be confirmed by the pottery found in the fill of the foundation trenches), is 4.6m wide and 1 lm long. This is the state which, with additions such as the altar of Athena Propylaia, and transformations which only affected its floor, survived till the end of antiquity. Other excavations. An earlier trench re-opened at right angles to the long side of the monument of Glaukos, 17m in front of wall M4 and the paved slope, had the aim of clarifying the date of that monument. Although the earlier excavations have deprived us of the levels related to the construction of the monument itself, the earlier stratigraphy is preserved, and can be found also in part in trench XXV, at right angles to the paved slope. We are led to conclude that the installation of the monument is in every way later than the filling of the paved slope, which took place in the second part of the 6th Ct BC. These observations strengthen the hypothesis that the monu- ment ( made, according to some, of reused material) is not in its original position or at its original level. An excavation opened in the corer of room ABMx of the ECh house gave no new information on its construction. On the other hand, immediately under the floor which was put in place towards the middle of the 4th Ct AD, we revealed a complex situation with construction fills and three walls, probably of houses, of the Greek period. It is possible to distinguish at least four different periods, each with its own spatial organisation. This excavation was stopped at a shallow level. The removal of a large slab in the street of the acropolis allowed us to dig the fill beneath. The material recovered (fragments of stamped amphoras and coins) allowed us to date this phase of the road at the latest to the 4th Ct AD. At the end of the excavation all trenches were backfilled. The R paving of the passage was replaced, including displaced slabs and fragments found in the course of our work. In the ECh house the floor of room ABME was reconstructed in identical material on the place of our trenches of 1992. At the place of the Theoroi, so called, we constructed a low wall parallel to the terrace wall of the Artemision, which delimits a lower area, and makes it possible to reveal the circular well, the rectangular well (the foundation of whose face has been uncovered again this year) and the foundation of the Alexandr- eion, and a higher level, linked to the peribolos of the Artemis- ion and its staircase, which gives access to the street of the acropolis." Thasos: Limenas (anc. Thasos). Chr. Sophianou, M. Nikolaid- ou-Patera and the Ephor Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki report the investigation of five building plots in the main town of Thasos in 1988. In the previously-excavated Zedros plot, N of the present house, part of an E-W road was found. It followed a natural slope, descending sharply from the Acropolis foothills to the lower town. It had a paved surface beneath which was a built drain for waste and storm water. It was bordered on either side by the external walls of houses. These continued below the paved road surface. Four building phases could be distin- guished, each related to a road of the same width and direction as the paved one. The earlier surfaces were of trodden earth. A preliminary study of the pottery suggested A to R occupation. The road was approximately parallel to three others (ADelt 32 Chr, 241; 36 Chr, 335 ff, 338) found in the same area, all running from the foothills to the lower town and all carrying storm water from the hill slopes to the sea. In the Oikonomides plot, situated near the S wall of the anc. city, between the Herakles and Silenus Gates, and first excavated in 1980 (ADelt 35 Chr, 419) an application for building extension resulted in the two anc. building phases formerly located being investigated over a wider area. Portions of two buildings found are likely to have belonged to houses situated N of a road discovered in 1980. Their probable dates were R and 4th Ct BC. Another application for extension led to the (non-adjacent) trenches 8 and 9 being opened in the previously-excavated Georgales plot (ADelt 34 Chr, 329). Test 8 contained walls from two building phases, which on the basis of the earlier excavation could be provisionally recognized as R and 4th Ct BC. Associated with the latter was a destroyed surface of large schist slabs and small marble ones. On this was a heavy level of burning, containing large sherds from plain domestic vessels. Test 9 had the same two building phases. The earlier was associated with a paved E-W road also found in the earlier excavation. A small N extension to the test showed that this road formed a cross-road with another known road which started from the gate of Herakles and cut through the anc. town on a N-S orientation. In the Kaspakes plot (part of the Klonares Bros. plot) there were only a few remains of later periods. In the Klonares Bros. plot an attempt to locate the continuation of the N fortification wall proved unsuccessful, but the work was unfinished and was to be continued in 1989. In the Gaitanides Plot, outside the anc. city walls in the R cemetery area, a R sarcophagus was found. On its cover was the inscription: EtoiaS Atov)Uo063pou / npoaotXj; Xacipe. (ADelt 43) In 1988 various fragments of funerary steles were found in the cemetery area of the anc. city, mostly in the Mourgena locality. From the cemetery in the vicinity of the Soultos land, which had been systematically excavated (ADelt 29 Chr, 278; 30 Chr, 278; 37 Chr, 316-22) came a marble pedestal with relief decoration of festoons and three bucrania. (ADelt 43) Nysteri. An excavation begun in 1987 on the land of N. Avramides (destined to be a campsite) was completed in 1988. Two 3 x 4m trenches were set out on the N, seaward, side of 51</page><page sequence="52">52 R. A. TOMLINSON the plot, 5m apart. In both tests was discovered part of the same amphora dump. The amphoras were plain, but a number of Thasian stamped handles with names such as KAAMOX, FOPFOE, HIY1ION, EPATON, NIKATOPAZ, KHEI2I QN, as well as other pottery, dated the dump to the 3rd Ct BC. Three rough walls were also found. (ADelt 43) Potos: Melissas. The upper part of a marble anthropomorphic stele representing a bearded warrior was found in this locality, washed down by a torrent. It was similar to those built into the enclosure wall at Skala Soteros. but was carved in a somewhat more advanced style; this need not necessarily be of chrono- logical significance. (ADelt 43) Skala Soteros. In the 1988 season at this important EBA site, excavated by the Ephor, Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki, it was established that the massive peribolos or enclosure wall, and the buildings within it, belonged to the earlier of two EBA phases, while the floor with the pots in situ under masses of burnt clay excavated in 1987, plus parts of two buildings separated by a narrow road excavated in 1988, belonged to the later EBA phase. The missing head of the life-sized anthropo- morphic 'warrior stele' of 1987 was found in 1988, built into the same wall as the body, but lower down. Parts of other steles were found built into the enclosure wall in 1988. As the anthropomorphic steles were built into the walls of the earlier of the two EBA phases, they must have come from a context earlier still, but a test below the floors of the earlier EBA phase showed no signs of earlier habitation with which they could be associated. The earlier phase at Skala Soteros should be contemporary with Sitagroi Va, which provides a terminus ante quem for the dating of the anthromorphic steles. They were not confined to Skala Soteros-see Potos above. (ADelt 43) An extended report for this season was published in AEMTH 2 (1988) 421-6. THRACE (19th Ephorate) No report from the Prehistoric and Classical Ephorate is printed in ADelt 43. Didymoteichon. Excavations of the Byzantine settlement in the kastron continued. A small and isolated area was examined. Finds included a Byz house dug into the rock surface, complete with holes for pithoi and cisterns for the collection of rain water. Holes further up were for beams supporting an upper storey. Glazed sherds suggest a 14th Ct date. The first period of settlement is impossible to determine; the 14th Ct settlement seems to have been abandoned peacefully. The inhabitants used underground areas for storage and systematic collection was made of rain water; courtyards or gardens are notable by their absence, as are even the most basic traces of a drainage system. (ADelt 43) Mt Papikion (AR 1992-93, 64; AR 1993-94, 66). Excavations by N. Zekos uncovered a single-naved church (13.45 x 7.20m) NW of Kerasia in the nome of Rhodope. This would appear to be the katholikon of an as yet (1988) un-excavated monastery. The church consists of a large rectangular narthex (7.30 x 3.70m), broader than the nave itself, and a square nave facing the sanctuary apse. Blind arches (arcosolia ?) in the narthex use the recessed brick technique, recorded here for the first time at Papikion. The narthex represents a later building phase (late 12th Ct). Conches on either side of the narthex entrance to the nave contain wall-paintings (orant Virgin with the Child in a circle, and a much damaged bishop with scroll). The nave was domed, of the free-cross type, apparently widely used at Papikion. Traces of the altar base were found on the carefully laid marble sanctuary floor; the altar (a marble slab resting on four small square piers) was also found in fragmentary condition. The templon stylobate was found intact. Prothesis and diakonikon, both tiny, open directly into the walls on either side of the altar. Traces of wall-paintings in the sanctu- ary appear to date to the first building phase (late lth-early 12th Ct) which involved the erection of the nave, while the second layer appears to be associated with the late 12th Ct phase of the narthex. Important architectural members, many decorated with foliate and geometric motifs, were found both inside and outside the church, suggesting violent and wilful destruction. (ADelt 43) Apogeumatine 13.2.95 reported that at the Lynos monastery complex on Papikion (it is not clear whether this is the same as that near Kerasia mentioned above, since descriptions of both are very similar) important small finds were uncovered. These include silver thread found in association with a ring that the excavators believe, on the basis of its inscription, to have belonged to the empress Maria Botaneiate (end of the 11th Ct). Also found were an enameled gold enkolpion, depicting the orant Theotokos, 12th-13th Ct pottery and 120 coins from the mid-11th to the 14th Ct. Wall-paintings are also reported. Samothrace. J.R. McCredie reports: "Work was confined to the W slope of the E hill, where a foundation discovered in 1993 had been tentatively identified as that for the E wall of the Temenos. These excavations revealed parts of the N, E, and S foundations of the Temenos covered with debris which contained 80 marble blocks and fragments, of which most belong to the SE corer of the Temenos, a few to the Hieron and other buildings and monuments. The evidence of foundations and of marble superstructure shows that the appearance of the Temenos was rather different from our previous view of it. It was twice as wide as we had thought (20.7m at the S, 23m at the N, where the porch projects) and comprised two identical halls entered from a deep Ionic porch at the N. The porch had projecting wings at E and W, each probably with four columns in facade and one in return on each side. They were separated by a row of three columns aligned on the return columns. The building was entirely of marble on the exterior. The interior wall had sandstone backers to the marble stretchers and was stuccoed. The Ionic entablature of the facade, architrave, frieze sculpted with dancers, dentils, geison and sima, was carried round the whole building. The building was roofed and its name was, therefore, unlikely to be 'Temenos'. The newly exposed E foundation, like the W foundation, was built of porous sandstone blocks laid as headers and stretchers in a random pattern on a subfoundation of fieldstone boulders. The S part of this foundation and a portion of the S foundation incorporated earlier constructions, whose character and date are still unclear. Both lay inside the perimeter of the building and were partly buried in the building's construction fill. A marble block of one of these earlier constructions, reworked as a backer for the exceptionnally narrow euthynteria T308, was clamped both to that block and to its S neighbour, T306. It shows that the foundation rose to a height one course higher than now preserved at the SW comer. At the N a foundation of porous sandstone was uncovered immediately S of the prominent 'terrace wall' of polygonal fieldstone boul- ders, to support the inner row of columns of the porch. Like</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 53 the sandstone foundations which abut the 'terrace wall' at its N comers, it often shows dressing on the top of a course to accommodate individual blocks of the course above, a tech- nique that unites all the foundations. It is evident that, first, the boulder foundation was laid on the uneven bedrock, to form a subfoundation which terminated at the E in a single, huge boulder, previously interpreted as an altar. Then, porous foundations were added to the N, to accommodate the project- ing wings of the facade, and at the S, to accommodate the second row of columns. The floor of the porch rested on a stone packing within these foundations. A small area of floor, made of marble chips set in plaster, is preserved adjacent to the E wall of the building, ca 5m N of its SE corer. It rests on or just above bedrock and must belong to the building. Whether it is contemporary with the construction of the building or a later replacement cannot now be determined. From the recovered marble blocks, it is clear that the wall was built of courses of stretchers 63-67cm high with sandstone backers alternating with courses of marble binders, 23-26cm high. The interior face of the wall must have been stuccoed, and fragments of red, white and black stucco were found in the debris, though none is still attached to the blocks. Several stucco mouldings were recovered. The exact schemes, both of the wall's jointing and of its interior decoration require further study. This wall was crowned by wall architraves (of which those at the N and S bore lips on the interior to accommodate the ceiling, while those at the E and W lacked that lip-one of each type was recovered); by the frieze of dancing maidens (of which the SE corner block and its N neighbour were recovered); by a dentil course (of which the corner block and numerous fragments were recovered); and by the geison-sima, with rinceaux and lion's head spouts on the lateral sima of the E and W. The SE corer block, which includes the junction of the lateral, horizontal and raking geisa and simas, and its neighbour to the N were recovered virtually complete. The geison-sima demonstrates that the building was roofed. It bears cuttings in its upper surface for rafters and in its lower surface for cross beams; the latter rested in a socket in the frieze and went entirely through the dentil course. The base of the SE corner acroterion, carved to fit the geison-sima, was recovered. Fragments of leaves and tendrils show that at least one of the building's acroteria was floral. Only a very small amount of the building's construction fill was excavated. It contained, in addition to the working chips of marble and sandstone, pottery of the third quarter of the 4th Ct, which confirms the previously determined date of ca 340 BC. Pottery of the 6th and 5th Cts BC in the filling of the porch attests to earlier activity in the area, as do the earlier constructions incorporated into the building's door-wall and its E and S foundation. A retaining wall protected the E and S sides of the building from the hillside into which it was set. Standing some 1.5-2.5m from the building, it was built of marble, sandstone, limestone and tile set in mortar. Its precise date, clearly in the R period, has not yet been determined. The building fell, presumably in an earthquake, later than the construction of the retaining wall, but at a date which cannot yet be more precisely determined. The upper parts of the wall fell onto the terrace, while the lower parts remained on or near their original location. These lower blocks were subsequently disturbed and robbed. For an unknown reason, many blocks were left stacked over the foundation, while the foundation itself was partially torn up. Later still, a second earthquake caused these stacks of blocks to topple and brought down much of the retaining wall, which, except for its corer, is either severely inclined or (in much of its length) fallen on its face. With the debris of the retaining wall and its terrace fell the upper blocks of our building. At some time, possibly in connection with one of these earthquakes, a torrent scoured a channel through the building more than 5m deep. It carried away all before it, including all but the easternmost stone of the N foundation's E half. Later still, a lime kiln was dug into the E foundation of the building. The builders of the kiln destroyed part of the foundation and subfoundation, which they used in the wall of their kiln, but were apparently unaware of the trove of marble buried just to the S of it. Material in the limekiln's debris comes almost exclusively from the Hieron. An Ott coin of 1899 was recovered from that debris, and suggests that the kiln belonged to the active lime burning reported by 19th Ct visitors to the sanctuary. It is already evident that the building with which we are concerned is not only the earliest marble building in the Sanctuary but the largest. It must have dominated the Sanctu- ary and been its architectural focus, not only when first constructed, but throughout antiquity. It must also have held some central place in the cult. The details of its appearance and its function will require much further study." Xanthi. The press reported the discovery of an Asklepieion. NORTHEAST AEGEAN ISLANDS (20th Ephorate) Museum works and new acquisitions for 1988 are reported in ADelt 43; at this time new guard huts and ticket offices were built at Klopedi and Mesoi, Lesbos and Hephaistia, Lemnos. Chios: town. Work was completed on the Kladia plot (Konst. Monomachos St.) in the area of Frangomachala. Post-Byz (16th Ct) ceramic production areas had three building phases; burnt floors and wall, as well as waste heaps, confirm the identifica- tion. From the rescue excavation on the Kostalos plot (Oinou- ssa St.) came rf and bf vases as well as stamped loomweights, stamped amphora handles, HL figurine fragments and bronze Chiot coins. Work continued on the Kourtesi plot (G. Voria St.) where HL plaster floors were uncovered. Traces of earlier phases were also found. Bf and rf are reported. Lemnos: Myrina. Excavations continued in the Recha Nera area, the site of PR Myrina. Tests in the Salamousa plot uncovered two phases of EBA building remains and domestic pottery. (ADelt 43) Poliochni. Conservation of the house remains went ahead with the Italian School of Archaeology under the direction of S. Tine. Five soundings were carried out in conjunction with the Ephoreia during these operations detailed in ADelt 43, notably in the areas around the bouleuterion and 'megaron 604- 609'. Part of the well-preserved E staircase was uncovered at the northern limit of the bouleuterion. Four pithoi and other vase fragments were recovered. Hephaistia or Palaiopolis. The opening of a country road to Ag. Melitini appears to have destroyed much of a workshop for bronze objects. To the N was a tomb of the first half of the 5th Ct BC. (ADelt 43) Lesbos: Mytilene. The 1987 excavations in the plot for the new museum (8th November/Skra Sts.), which uncovered part of the Sanctuary of Aphrodite, were continued in 1988. The rest of the altar was cleared and a R drainage system was</page><page sequence="54">54 R. A. TOMLINSON at various spots. The Canadian Institute continued to work with the Ephorate on the plot in Nikomedias St. Early phases beneath the R building go back to A times. Part of the 4th Ct BC city wall was uncovered in the W of the plot. The Institute also con- tinued excavation in the Kastro of Mytilene. Building works at the 2nd Demotic School uncovered figurine fragments and kiln debris of the EHL period. Methymna. Rescue excavations continued at the HL cemetery on Petras (Mygia plot) where three communal burials, two sarcophagi and a cist grave were found. Building remains of A date were found in the NE. Finds from the graves include a clay statue of Eros. A paved way 2.55 m wide was found in the Mavridis-Linardatos plot with building remains of at least two phase, A and HL. Disturbed levels produced PR sherds, A and HL sherds and a number of bone and stone tools as well as coins. Two clay statuettes of Aphrodite and one of Eros are also noted. (ADelt 43) Fig. 27 uncovered, as well as HL and C building remains, storage areas of A date. The latter are founded on prehistoric levels (EMH). Opposite the new museum area (Chademenou plot), building remains presumably belong to the Sanctuary of Aphrodite area. In the area of the orphanage (8th November Street) A, R and Byz building remains lay beneath a Turkish cemetery; PG and LG sherds came from the lowest level reached. A HL well produced pottery, figurines and coins. Again, these building remains must be related to the Sanctuary of Aphrodite as the fine clay statue and figurine fragments show. A superb array of HL pottery is illustrated with the latter in ADelt 43. Rescue excavations at Katsakouli street uncovered building remains of LR and HL, the latter including a court and well; a LA wall divided the entire site in two. A hoard of 61 bronze coins was also recovered. On the OTE plot (Vournazon St.) a much used C paved roadway running E-W and a marble pedestal were found; pottery from the plot ranges from C to R. A HL cemetery was found on the Kamatsou plot (El. Venezelou St.) with ten built tombs and two open burials. The finds included coins of Mytilene (350-250 BC), a silver coin (440-350 BC), gold wreaths and nine clay statues of youths. Pseudo-isodomic walls and part of the R drainage system of the city were found on the Hatzisavvas plot. An amphora production store is reported from the Konteli plot (Xanthou). Elsewhere, the drainage system of ancient Mytilene turned up CYCLADES AND SAMOS (21st Ephorate) Delos: theatre. Ph. Fraisse and J.-Ch. Moretti (French School) report on work in the theatre. "The building was cleaned and the koilon recorded by photogrammetry. The study of the stage building was com- pleted, and it was possible to undertake a programme of restoration. Several blocks coming from the skene building and the the cistern were joined together by E. Desroches and M.-L. Courboules. Note particularly the reassembling of a crowning block of one of the facade niches of the skene (Fig. 26), of part of the cornice of the proskenion, of the lower part of one of the piers of the portico attached to the skene, and of an edge slab of the cistern. The recomposition of six fragments of a pier with a half column of the proskenion has been undertaken (Fig. 27). The support, whose lower and upper ends are partially preserved, is 2.005m high. Bearing in mind that the height of the only capital with its top and bottom surfaces preserved is .125m, the average height of the architrave blocks is .1995M, of the frieze .227M, and of the cornice blocks .1115M, we can restore the total height of the order at 2.668m." Delos: Treasury V: A. Farnoux (French School) reports on excavations in Treasury V (Guide de Delos 16): "Excavations in 1990 and 1991 had demonstrated the importance of the sector for the study of the Myc occupation of Delos. The extent of the ruins, and the presence of numer- ous sherds in the walls or nearby made further excavation desirable. Eight trenches were opened inside the treasury. Trenches 2-8 correspond to the following rooms of the Myc habitation: 9, 10, 2", 5, 4, and 17, according to the numbering given to them by H. Gallet de Santerre. A single trench was opened outside the building to the W of room 9. The object of the excavations was to define the floor levels of the rooms, if they still existed, to recover the pottery still present in the strata, and to establish a precise chronology, based on the stratified material. The sector had been excavated successively by Homolle in 1877, by Courby in 1904 and H. Gallet de Santerre in 1947: all noted the presence of Myc pottery, without assigning it to a precise place in the stratigraphy. Three trenches, 3, 5, and 7, provided answers to these questions. The first rode over rooms 10 and 17, the second was in the N part of room 5, and the third in the E part of room 10. Trenches 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 provided only a level of archaeologi- Fig. 26</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 55 cal throwback dating from the excavations of Homolle (coin of 1868), resting on virgin soil. From the fillback we extracted sherds and several marble fragments, including a fragment of guttae and an antefix of the archaic period, as well as several worked blocks. Virgin soil was either granite or a level of decomposed granite, yellow orange in colour and granular. In trenches 3 and 5 (rooms 17 and 5) we found, immedi- ately under the throwback, two superimposed floors, of beaten earth and white clay, associated with a wall covering of clay of the same colour. The earth separating the two floors was very compacted and contained numerous inclusions of white or red clay, as well as small sherds, shells, and bones. This is probably building material used in the construction of the walls: it is probable that what is preserved today of the walls of the Myc house comprises in reality only the footing of stone for a superstructure of mudbrick. Everything was covered with a clayish plaster. Samples were taken from the floors for analysis, and it is planned next year to use flotation to recover micro remains. At the same time, the presence of shells and bones in the floors makes specialist study essential. This material, together with that discovered in the Prytaneion in 1987, will provide information on the flora and fauna of the island in the Myc epoch, as well as 6n the food. In trench 7, excavation under the first base of the colon- nade of treasury V (room10) made possible the uncovering of a levelling fill put in place after the construction of the building. It had been somewhat disturbed by burrows dug by animals after Homolle's excavation. Finally, the cleaning of the wall surfaces in the light of their redrawing gave the opportun- ity to recover sherds incorporated into the jointing or in the white clay accumulated at the foot. The excavation has provided Myc material in which the early phases of LH III are essentially represented. Certain of the sherds from the earth of the walls can be assigned to an earlier period (LH II or I). In trench 5 we found a floor level passing under the wall separating rooms 5 and 2". At the moment this cannot be associated with any preserved wall, but it is probable that it belongs to an earlier period of occupation. It is clear that in any case the Myc habitation situated under Treasury V was for the most part built in an area empty of all construction, since the first floor of room 17 rests directly on virgin soil, and the material recovered in the fill of room 10 is very close chronologically. The presence of slashing visible at certain parts of the construction, and the succession of floors are to be attributed to the length of occupation in LH III. This will be established after the study of the material, but it is likely that it extends only from LH IIIA to LH IIIB. No trace of G occupation has been found. The information recovered this year will enable us to reopen the question of Myc architecture at Delos, as much from the point of view of construction methods as the arrangement of rooms (level of circulation, etc.)." Ikaria. An R wall 2.5m high and an ancient reservoir were found at Kampos in 1988 during tests. (ADelt 43) At the A. Kiourani plot on the northern slopes of Ag. Eirene, in an area known for LR and other remains (ADelt 37), the corer of a LR building 3.4m high was found. A square building with an entrance to the E came to light beneath a layer of HL and late antique sherds. G and A sherds, as well as a few PR, were found beneath the foundations. Part of a LR settlement was uncovered on the Dimitriou plot near the Kampos beach. los: ancient town. Surface survey and rescue excavation have elucidated the fortification system and course of the town walls. The excavations in the Konsta plot had two aims, namely to verify the existence of the wall and check the rest of the plot for antiquities. The wall is constructed of local oblong schist blocks with a width of 2.1m and preserved height of up to 4m. Whilst tests did not reach bedrock to allow secure dating, the lowest levels yielded A and C pottery to which periods some parts of the walls should belong; however, the general picture of major parts of the wall is of a HL construc- tion. Most of the other settlement remains on the plot were of LR date. However, the large extent of the area meant that tests were widely spaced and buildings were not totally excavated. Auxiliary buildings were uncovered in the NE (lavatory and cooking area-drains and hearth). A major building was discovered in the SW, with a threshold of schist blocks. The ancient town was clearly centred round the top of the Kastro and enclosed by a perimeter wall. The drainage system is impressive with small channels leading to a major conduit. (ADelt 43) Kouphonisi. On the Simidala plot, just N of the school, a deposit .5-1m thick, of ECyc II sherds, stone tools and obsidian was found in a hollow in bedrock. Mykonos. The press reported the discovery of a Myc tholos tomb, built at the end of the 15th Ct, but with pottery from many burials of 14th and 13th Cts BC. There was much pottery of mainland (Argolid) origin. Naxos. Rescue excavations in 1988 at the Chora were concentrated on a flat area of 15 stremmata on the E side of the ring-road. Fourteen plots were examined, with most ancient finds being made on the southern side. Plot 1 yielded a R cist grave covered with marble slabs containing many glass vessels and other objects. Part of a R building lay to the E, with earlier R remains on a different axis beneath; the earlier building appears to have been associated with large pithoi set in the bedrock. A well nearby contained a im thick layer of water borne sand containing HL, Cl, G and even Myc pottery. This is a phenomenon noted elsewhere in the area. Plot 4 produced three tombs cut into the soft bedrock. One was a tile grave with only a coin near the skull of the deceased; the other two were covered by marble slabs and contained two burials. Glass vessels and an iron strigil were among the grave goods. In Plot 8, bedrock was reached at .77m although the foundations of a large late antique structure were uncovered. The external walls were of great granite blocks which are assumed to have been re-used, perhaps from a LBA building rather than a R structure. (ADelt 43) On the opening of a road SW of the high school, a LA tomb 1.5 x .5m was found dug into bedrock and covered with schist slabs. A single burial was accompanied by a bf hydria depicting Herakles and an Amazon, two Cor kotylai, a bf lekythos showing Dionysus and a skyphos with a little Cor kotyle inside. The Attic imports are dated to the late 6th/early 5th Ct BC. The tomb is a welcome addition to G and A burials previously excavated in the area. (ADelt 43) Preparations were made for the conservation and roofing of the excavations, supported by the AS. Small supplementary excavations brought new evidence for the history of the area in the Myc period, with interesting pottery. A large crater by the Naxos vase painter, known from his other work, depicts a woman standing upright on a horse. Another find was the torso of a marble male statue, probably an athlete, of the 4th Ct BC. At Aplomata B. Lambrinoudakis completed his rescue excavation. E of the room with the mosaic floor of the late</page><page sequence="56">56 R. A. TOMLINSON antique house he found a room with a pebble floor and structures confirming occupation of this area. No remains of the G and A cemetery of the area were found. On the SE slope of Aplomata (Vasalaki plot), divided from the G cemetery and HL and R houses (ADelt 34 Chr, 366), part of a LR house was uncovered with two building phases. In the later phase there were storage basements with pithoi standing on earth floors. Virgin soil was reached at 4.3m, the sherds just above being domestic R. To the W about 400m from Aplomata Tombs A and B, the stereo was much higher and dug into it was a Myc ChT with its entrance on the SE blocked by a dry stone wall; it had been robbed in antiquity. There was one major and at least four earlier burials, the latter found in a heap in the SW. Middle LH IIIC pottery dated the tomb: a strainer jug (FS 157) is unique in its decoration of rows of fishermen and fish on the shoulder. Kokkinovrachos is a small rocky rise at Grotta where in 1988 part of a LN house was uncovered-a wall 2m long with a pebble floor and a circular pit cut into the rock containing sherds and bones (ADelt 43). The pottery was abundant and links the discovery with that on the Dimitrokalli plot further S. Shell and obsidian flakes were also recovered. To the N, a R foundation trench cut the N deposit. Apollona. Eirene Roufani plot: ancient quarrying is visible here as well as a large fragment of marble, perhaps from a plinth. Archaic house remains were found, perhaps the dwell- ings of workers. Deeper soundings produced some prehistoric pottery. Other localities: 800m SW of Mikri Vigla at Kleidi, MCyc and LCyc sherds were found on the surface, although it was thought that they had been washed down from a settlement further up the hill. Building remains of insecure date were found at Polychni-Skarphou and Plaka. An ECyc cemetery is noted at Oskelos. At the prehistoric acropolis of Spedos, a wall was visible on the surface and nearby there were traces of old robbing of the ECyc cemetery. At Skales, the road has destroyed part of a prehistoric settlement, the rest of which is preserved on the top and S side of the hill. ECyc sherds are scattered around. At Lakkos in the area of Marathos, the ECyc cemetery showed signs of robbing. Kalantos is said to have been a particularly desirable bay for prehistoric settle- ment. An ECyc cemetery was excavated here in the early years of this century at Karvounolakkoi. Other tombs have been robbed in recent years at Pateoura. A little to the N, there are signs of LCyc settlement. Two settlements were noted on the slopes of Gleisoures and Velou where surface sherds include ECyc and LCyc. In a trial, part of a square building of schist came to light with two phases; diagnostic sherds were ECyc IIIB. At Chliaris, stream water had uncovered a row of tombs on the E side of the slope. Many obsidian flakes and blades were found with ECyc I and II pottery. A simple pit grave was opened, the deceased devoid of grave goods. Paros. Apart from completing the exhibition of the prehistoric material from Paroikia, Koukounaries and Saliagos in the Museum at Paroikia, Ph. Zapheiropoulou reported on the following works in 1988 (ADelt 43): A large ceramic production area was uncovered at Tholak- ia in 1986-87. Only a second reservoir and two more kilns-making a total of five-were found. In the N part of the area, the A cemetery was found to continue N onto the land of the Theochares brothers, where seven cist graves were exca- vated. Ionian kylikes, small Corinthian aryballoi and an inscribed funeral stele were amongst the finds. In the area of the Paroikia harbour where a sewage system was being installed, the finds included a marble horse statue, a bull's head with lion's paw clamped over its muzzle, and various architectural fragments. A late HL tomb with marble cover slab was found at Parasporos where there is a camp site. Pholegandros (AR 1993-94, 68). Remains of a PR settlement were noted on a small rocky peninsula at Kastellos. Sherds were very few but obsidian flakes plentiful. (ADelt 43) Phournoi. Archaeologically, this is a little known group of islands near Ikaria, Phoumoi itself being the largest. The location of various sites is noted by Ph. Zapheiropoulou in ADelt 43. The ancient name of the acropolis at Ai-Giorge has been ascertained from a rock inscription: Korsites. The pottery here is HL to R. Samos. Pythagoreion. Over 20 building plot excavations are detailed for 1988, an important contribution to the archaeology of the anc. town. At OT 45 (Kalograia plot) three successive stages of R occupation with walls and paved floors were uncovered. Parts of two carefully constructed A walls, built of slab-like stones bound by earth, apparently belonged to a circular or apsidal structure. A small stone mould for bronze objects was found in between the curved walls. Between the sea and the Byz city walls, at OT 86 (Olga Melachrinou plot), three walls were uncovered at different levels; among the finds were HL and late antique pottery, many Megarian bowl fragments, stamped handles, and bronze coins (HL and late antique). At OT 47 (Kyriazi-Gripari plot), two successive phases of rough walling were brought to light, as well as part of a drain- age system. Finds included late Cl and HL pottery, stamped amphora handles and badly preserved bronze coins. At the junction of Pythagoras and Odysseas Orologas St. (OT 33), part of the late antique walls of the town have been destroyed by bulldozing. However, a fine wall (a) of dressed blocks with blind holes (for scaffolding?) was found with a later wall (a') built against its best northern face. A floor of square terracotta tiles was on the south side of the large wall (a); another wall (aI) ran at 90 degrees to the south face. LA and HL pottery is mentioned as well as many R and Byz amphoras. North of the Micheli plot, where part of the central Byz sewer had been uncovered, at the M. Sophianou plot (OT 69), more remains of this construction were found. In the S part of the drain, a marble R statue had been used to cover it; only the middle and lower part remained. The A. Lyberi plot at OT 17 is next to the Sandali plot where private house remains and pits had previously been found. In 1988, remains of two HL rooms were uncovered, again belonging to a private house. The Andreadaki plot (OT 50) produced late antique, Byz, R and some HL remains. Tests A-E uncovered walls and a sewage system of late antique date; Byz, R and HL building remains came from Tests Z-0 and A'-F' where excavation was deeper. Notable was the fine 2nd Ct BC mosaic floor to the E of wall 18, at the southern end of which was depicted a galloping horse. In addition, at least two A walls were found. Part of an A wall was also found on the P. Kalymniou plot which otherwise produced a late antique drainage system and part of the wall of the ancient city. Again close to the Micheli plot with the town sewers, at OT 70 (M. Provatari plot), 3 tests were made, yielding only late antique walls in two tests. The Tsakoumaki plot at OT 47 produced two marble fluted column drums .7m in diameter.</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 In the Hatzidaki plot at OT 17, seven tests uncovered frag- ments of squared masonry, columns, a drainage channel of the A period, a later reservoir, and parts of marble objects and architecture. Of pottery, G sherds were few, Cl was black- glazed and badly preserved, and HL and later were plentiful. HL and Byz bronze coins and glass objects were amongst the other finds. The Emm. Micheli plot (OT 70) is near the ancient harbour of Samos. The most important find was 7m of the well- preserved ancient sewer. It was covered by huge rectangular stone slabs. The orientation was NW-SE and it must have been part of the main system of the city which ended in the area of Tarsana Pythagoreion. In the Ph. Moschona plot (OT 52), an A wall was found on virgin white clay. The V. Kalogeropoulou plot (OT 66) produced no struc- tural remains, although the pottery included a Megarian bowl fragment and a G sherd with meander pattern. In the Bibeli plot (OT 34), two walls appear to be part of a triangular projection of the harbour wall which held defens- ive weaponry. Bedrock was close to the surface over much of the Andreadaki-Kantaxi plot. On the S terrace, 12 roughly built ECh tombs were found with a few sherds in each burial. MByz walls also occurred along with a finely constructed well dug out only to a depth of 4m and, therefore, undated. On the W side of the S terrace, a room with a 9m2 mosaic floor was found; its border is white with vine and rhomboid designs in white, blue, terracotta, green and yellow on the interior. Probable HL building remains came from the central terrace. A well-built reservoir complex was also located. The reservoirs were preserved to a height of 1.75-1.90 m and can be dated to the Byz period. To the same period appears to belong a well constructed of large blocks with plaster, just S of the reser- voirs. Another well, in between, produced much late HL pottery including Megarian bowls. Yet another HL well, on the W of the slope, was associated with channels and hydraulic cement. A superbly built HL house was constructed on bedrock, the masonry thought to be re-used from the A period. OT 55 (Nanas Taliadourou-Samara plot), on the left hand side of the main road to the harbour, produced little of interest apart from limestone fragments and broken architectural pieces. Pottery included HL, R and Byz. OT 45 (Tzereta-Alexandrou plot) was more rewarding, with R building remains and parts of a well-preserved water and drainage system. The ruins should link up with the ECh basilica on the Ollandezou plot (ADelt 28 Chr, 530) since the road leading to it was uncovered in OT 45. Some ruined ECh graves were also found. Two reservoirs were perhaps the most important finds in the middle of the Tzereta plot. Lined with hydraulic cement, they were linked to a well cut into bedrock and covered by a marble slab. The E. Hatzigeorgiou plot at OT 33 comprised two terraces, W and E. On the W terrace was a superbly-preserved hypocaust with three unique apses, two of which were uncovered, the third lying beneath the old house to the W. It is of late R construction and probably belonged to a small public bath house for the richer residences in the neighbour- hood. The I. Solounia plot at OT 58 brought to light the founda- tion courses of a large public building. The preserved height is 1.6m and it is thought to have been destroyed by earthquake. The building is tentatively identified as a R temple which faced the Sacred Way of the city. In 1987, at Papavangelinos, while digging the ditch for military telephone wires, a sarcophagus was uncovered which proved to be from a small toumba with burials of different periods. The excavation was completed in 1988 with the recovery of four sarcophagi, some pit-like graves and two later roughly built tombs. The first two sarcophagi produced some superb vases dated to around 480-470 BC, a bronze mirror and a bronze strigil, well illustrated in ADelt 43. The press reported underwater investigation of the artificial harbour works created by Polykrates; this revealed part of the ancient breakwater on the S side, continuing the line of the land wall, while on the N side the modem mole is based on the ancient harbour works. Siphnos. At Kastro, a R reservoir was found during pipe laying operations in 1988. It was roughly circular (diam. 2.45m) with a column and capital in the middle and the walls covered with hydraulic cement. A possible R structure with plastered walls was located at Marmara-Tholos. Pottery was described as late antique. (ADelt 43) Thera. At Akrotiri, Ch. Doumas continued his excavations. In room la of synkrotema A the excavation produced 78 vases. Notable among them was a Syrian amphora on which was written the sign T, a small stone bowl and a quantity of bones. Some of the vases contained stores, which on examination proved to be wheat, barley and pulse. Vases were also found in building 8a of the same synkrotema, small in size. More significant, however, was a bronze saw 59cm long, the same size as a present-day example. The wooden handle was not preserved, but two pegs which fixed it to the blade remained. In 1994 the S room of the ground floor, 18a, was investi- gated. It was covered with material from the roof covering of clay and pebbles, a remnant of the original construction. The fill had preserved the shapes of objects made of organic material. Of these either casts were made, or the fill which preserved the shape was consolidated. In this way the form of baskets, furniture and chests were preserved. The contents of a wooden chest deposited in a basket included small bronze implements, such as a fan, cups, a jug, two small cups and a dagger with three silver nails. In a small room were found a random collection of objects, including small bronze fishhooks, plaques, clay and stone objects, tables and chairs, apparently placed there a little before the earthquake that preceded the volcanic eruption. Noteworthy among these finds are a stone communal cup, and an alabaster rhyton. In another synkrotema of the PR city, in Xeste 3, room 16 was investigated. Beneath the volcanic level the upper part of the roof of the house was uncovered, evidenced by the impressions of heavy beams. Between rooms 15 and 16 and the house of the Benches, a small passage was uncovered in which was preserved the upper part of a long wall runing E-W and belonging to a building older than Xeste 3 and the house of the Benches. From the fill above it came sherds of a large LC I vessel, which had on it a representation of gryphons. E of Xeste 3 is found Xeste 4, whose so-called Great Staircase leads to the second floor of the building. The wall which borders the staircase itself carries a large wall painting which starts at the ground floor. On it are men in a significant order, in a procession ascending a stair, presumably that of the building which it decorates. W of Xeste 5 is is the square which has been called the Square of the Cenotaph. From the archaeological data it appears that it took its form at the beginning of the LC I period; then it was strewn with earth and building remains which had resulted from a seismic catastrophe. The continu- 57</page><page sequence="58">58 R. A. TOMLINSON ation of the stratigraphical investigation confirmed the use of the ground below the square as a cult place, at least in the EC period. A special role in the ritual seems to have been played by the pyre which was found here in 1969. Kamari (Oia). Excavations by the 21st Prehistoric and Classical Ephorate of an A cemetery established the plan of a small three-apsed, three-aisled Byz basilica (?6th Ct) aligned with the sanctuary facing E (13 x 10.6m including narthex). The narthex, closed off except for an entrance from the S, is paved with small stones and decorative inclusions of volcanic rock fragments: three crude circular motifs leading from the S entrance to a square motif at the threshold of the nave. Entrance to the side aisles is made from the narthex alone; there are no openings leading outside from the aisles. The aisles are almost separate chambers, opening to the nave only by single central openings. A bench-like structure had been built along the SW and NW sections of the inner nave walls. A rectangular ancillary structure was attached to the outer NE wall, covering half the N apse and half the main apse of the sanctuary. It had no opening, and bone finds appear to indicate that it was used as an ossuary. Masonry consists of large limestone blocks and poor quality lime mortar. This unusual structure deserves further study to establish date and liturgical function. (ADelt 43) Work on the Argyros site, left of the main road leading to the coast revealed traces of EByz houses with walls preserved to .9-1.2m (limestone and some volcanic, rock with much use of ancient spolia). Many sherds from storage pithoi and LR 2 type amphoras decorated with incised bands were found, some on floor level. No tiles were found, suggesting a packed earthen roof. This evidence should be associated with the Byz basilica mentioned above, and other traces of a EByz settle- ment found at Kamari recently. If the pottery dates of 7th-8th Ct AD are correct, then the settlement probably came to an end in the great eruption of AD 726. (ADelt 43) DODECANESE AND AMORGOS (22nd Ephorate) Kos: town. Area of PR settlement-Seraglio: the 1988 excava- tions are reported in ADelt 43. Much of the work was carried out by the late Epimeletria Charis Kantzia, to whose efforts the history of Kos owes a great deal. Only well-dated discoveries are noted here. On the Mouzake plot (corer of Tsaldare and 31st March street), a HL fill lay above an A roadway (at 2.98m depth) flanked by a built drain and with a S-N orientation. To the S, at 3.79m lay a LM I level. At 4.66m depth, a level of volcanic ash was found which continued beneath the A road. In the Petala plot (31st of March street), R walls, notably a fine stylobate with dowel holes, may have had some connec- tion with the stadium. A fountain house with basement reservoir is said to have been built in the 4th Ct BC and continued in use, with at least two building phases, until the 2nd Ct AD. The construction of the fountain disturbed PR levels. In the central area of the town, close to the junction of the ancient walls with a branch of the harbour, an impressive late HL road was uncovered as well as a very productive pit filled largely with pottery of the same date but including some R. Almost the entire range of Koan late HL pottery was represented. (ADelt 43) An ancient road with drain was found in the Tsocha brothers' plot as well as part of a R building. The walls of the latter were preserved up to 1 m and may be part of the same insula as that uncovered in the Kassiote plot. Wall paintings with geometric decoration are noted as well as statuettes of Dionysus and Aphrodite amongst others. The best preserved parts of the building belong to the 2nd and 3rd Cts AD. Signs of the fierce fire which destroyed the site were found in the S sector of the plot. An inscribed altar base reads At6]5 / K]aoToac/Tou. (ADelt 43) In the E area of Kos town, on the large (1250 m2) Platani- sta plot, walls and mosaics were soon found in tests; important R remains were then uncovered from 1984-1988. A room filled with 70 small empty amphoras proved to be only a small part of a huge building at a depth of around 1.2-1.5m and covering about 900m2 The width is 30.6m, but its length is unknown since it extends beyond the confines of the plot. A flanking road and drain were dated to the 2nd Ct AD. The central part of the building (11 x 5.6m) revealed richly decorated mosaic floors, although not of the highest quality. Earlier phases were identified where mosaics were destroyed showing that the house could go back to ER. Later mosaic floors were also encountered, one with a medusa dating to the 5th Ct AD. The size of the house combined with the mosaic floors and traces of wall-paintings indicates that it must have been similar in private status to the House of Europa and Silenus and others excavated by the Italians. (ADelt 43) Rhodes: town. Extensive work continues on cleaning, restoring and investigating the town's many Med, Crusader and Ott monuments. Special interest has been shown in charting the extent and form of the pre-Crusader city fortifications. Excava- tions in 1988 revealed traces of the original Byz walls dating from the 7th to 12th Ct under and around the Palace of the Grand Master. Other excavations on Theophiliskou St. and elsewhere seem to indicate that the now-demolished (1851-56) inner wall was not originally built by the Knights but had existed in Byz times. Evidence for this was found in the northernmost of a course of two parallel walls 12-15m apart; the older wall was dated to 1118 at the latest, after comparison with the Byz wall behind the church of the Panagia on the Kastron. Extensive sections of walls and towers were located, including evidence for the Byz gate linking the upper with the lower city on 20 Lachetos St. Pottery included many 12-13th Ct glazed ware sherds. (ADelt 43) Further investigation of the Hospice of St Ann and its vicinity is reported. (ADelt 43) At 147 Menekleous St., excavations searching for the site of the Criminal Court of the Knights brought to light a large public Byz bathhouse (extant area 38m2), possibly the suc- cessor of a LR original. Coins dating to Heraklios (610-641), Romanos IV (1068-71) and the Knights were located along with glass fragments and glazed sgrafitto ware of the 12th-12th Ct. (ADelt 43) In 1988 work in the W sector of the New Town, at the A. Mangapha plot (Parodos Pindou 25) revealed semi-destroyed walls, a drain and a R-ECh mosaic. Excavations on Odos Cheimarras (Damionos plot) (1963-64 and 1984-88) brought to light architectural remains of different periods, notably a roughly paved area (LR or ECh) and beneath, part of the water system of ancient Rhodes and a well-preserved complex of rock-cut basements of EHL date. The water system includes basement reservoirs. The rock-cut basements included stair- cases and arched doorways and may have been used for storage. Work was completed in 1988 on the N. Mylonas plot, where a smelting works had been found in 1974. It had been set up in the area of a large HL sanctuary and is the largest bronze-working installation for statuary yet found on Greek</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 soil. Two huge elliptical pits had been cut into the poros bedrock. Statues over 10m in height were apparently made here, perhaps confirming Pliny's statement that there were 100 smaller colossi of Rhodes. The date of the workshop is the first quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 43 Chr, 583-609) Also in 1988, The Water Board of Rhodes had to excavate a trench in Demokratias for the sewage system. Some skeletons from the Turkish occupation were uncovered close to the surface. Otherwise, ancient walls followed the Hippodamian system. Part of a public building or shrine was found near the entrance to the University of the Aegean, and a small statue of Ganymede came from the same area. Sewage system construc- tion also took place on the main road from Rega Pheraiou in the town south to Vodi. Eight main find-spots are noted in ADelt 43 Chr, 590. Notable among the discoveries were parts of the ancient fortifications in Meg. Konstantinou. A large part of the HL walls had been uncovered in 1965-1967 (cf. AE 1967, figs. 1 &amp; 4). In 1987-1988, the aim was to pinpoint more of the walls and to uncover the drainage system in the A.B.E.- T.E.-Kostarides plot. In the Chr. Pitsios plot on Ag. Anarguroi, part of the foundation of the ancient wall was uncovered resting on bedrock. Parts of two marble statues-one male, one female-were found near here. A number of plots yielded cemetery evidence. In the N part of the M. Theodosios plot (OT 256), there was a ChT with five couches cut into the bedrock. The chamber had an E-W orientation and W entrance, whilst the couches themselves were arranged in a n-formation. Later wall construction was noted, taking up most of the W side of the plot, apparently belonging to a phase when quarrying occurred in the second half of the 2nd Ct BC. The tomb itself belongs to the 4th to mid-3rd centuries BC. Finds included amphoras, a gold ring, an unpainted lamp, three bronze coins and one of silver. Tomb 3 was a built cist grave in the S part of the plot, the goods with which belonged to the 2nd half of the 1 st Ct BC to the 1 st half of the 1st Ct AD. Other building plots with tombs as follows: on the St Papantoniou plot (OT 256), eight cist graves and two ChTs were dated to the 1st Ct BC. Three groups of tombs were found on the An. Kalogere plot (OT 256); the date range was from the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC to LR or ECh. Funerary fragments of the 2nd to 1st Ct BC came from the trench for drainage on Agathonesiou. Various inscribed pieces are also detailed in ADelt 43 Chr, 601. In the Ag. Triada area, the G. Chartophylli plot (OT 298) had earlier produced pit-graves (ADelt 39 Chr, 321). In 1988, five pit-graves were located in the W part of the plot although their date was not determined. Tombs dating chiefly to the late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC were found on the Vasileiou plot (OT 324). Part of the late HL Rhodian cemetery was uncovered in the Mich. Pagka plot on Emponas street (OT 345, K.M. 593); inscribed funeral stelai are noted in ADelt 43 Chr, 603. A total of 40 pit-graves were found on the plot of the 16th Demotic School, all cut into the virgin earth with orientations ranging from E-W to NW-SE. The chronological range is from the last quarter of the 4th to the 3rd Ct BC. A group of funerary monuments was first uncovered in the B. Kountouri plot (OT 364) in 1985; by 1988, their excavation was still incomplete. The complex is bordered by a peribolos wall on three sides with an entrance on the SE. Steps down to the tombs show that it was partly underground. The tombs on the S and E sides are the earliest belonging to the end of the 2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 43 Chr, 604) In the Rodini area on London street, three rock-cut reservoirs on successive levels were excavated on the I. Kapounatake plot; no date is given. (ADelt 43 Chr, 605) Nearby, on the P. and G. Spanos plot, a tholos-like construction with a fine archway was found in the middle of the area dating first to the early or middle HL period. A second phase can be placed in late HL. The masonry of this phase is reminiscent of the walls in the public green belt or Asbete- Liagka plot. The tholos structure and accompanying reservoir and drainage installations can be assumed to have belonged to a funerary monument. Later phases were also noted up to the period of Turkish occupation. (ADelt 43 Chr, 609) Outside the town of Rhodes, various excavations took place on building plots or in connection with new sewage systems. A four-sided funerary area was discovered on the Kazoule land. Three ChTs were cut into the bedrock on the W side, and there were traces of a fourth on the N side. Inscrip- tions found here are of importance for their information on the family: MEAQNOE APIETOKPATOY NETTIAA to which the graves belonged. A superb set of late HL relief sculptures was found during the sewage system excavation near Vodi in 1986. The right hand figure is of a young man with long hair, spear in hand and clasping a tree-trunk around which a snake is entwined; the left figure is another youth trying to rein in a horse; the central warrior is trying to restrain the horse with his right hand whilst clasping his sword hilt in his left. The group of youths can be dated to the 1st Ct BC. Later, in 1988, an EC relief group was found nearby. (ADelt 43 Chr, 610) Ialysos. A great deal of information has been gathered for every period from PR to EByz in the Ialysos area. Eleven new sites were investigated at the M and Myc settlement at Trianda, thereby allowing the definition of the E, NE, N, W and NW edges of the settlement. A LM IA road was identified in the Liame plot, with a N-S orientation. A MBA site, contemporary with the Philerimos settlement, was located whilst digging a bothros at the Tsakire-Maroukla plot, 250m S of the known extent of the LM IA settlement. Theran ash has been recovered from seven new sites (1988). HL remains were found above A in the Lagos plot at Kremaste, near the Italian excavations of the Ialysos cemetery. A small ECh basilica on the Ioannides plot lies W of the LM IA cemetery. (ADelt 43 Chr, 612) LR tile graves and one burial in an amphora were found in the Tsakire-Maroukla plot above LM I and uniquely important MBA levels. The Pantaze plot on the borders of the M and Myc settlement produced PR sherds but no architectural remains. The Tsavare plot revealed a LM IB/LH IIA level above a stratum of sand, pebbles and sporadic mature LM IA sherds to a depth of 2.45m. Beneath was another mature LM IA layer, with ELM IA beneath that to a depth of 3.5m, where virgin soil was reached. In other areas, LM I levels were also reached, notably in the Ioannides plot (KM 623 E), immediate- ly N of the Tsavare plot, where part of the LM I cemetery was found. Here, seven empty graves, two cist graves and a pithos burial were uncovered. One of the skeletons (5) was stratified in a LM IA layer beneath a later wall (apparently LH IIIA2 or later); beneath was LM IA1 (sic) pottery to a depth of 4.2m. Graves with no more than the skeletons were also found on the Brothers Kosta plot (KM 600), just N of the original Italian excavations. Twelve complete skeletons were recovered from a total of 17 burials, all with their skulls to the S. Walls on the S of the plot belonged to the Myc settlement. LM IA and Myc walls were also found on the Vergote plot, S of the Italian excavations. An ELM IA layer was found on the Doukakis plot near the main road (KM 545); it lay between 3.73 and 4.22m from the surface, beneath a level with Myc and LM I pottery. building remains of LM IA and LH IIIA are reported from the 59</page><page sequence="60">60 R. A. TOMLINSON Liame plot, indicating that the PR settlement continued W of the Trianda river. (ADelt 43 Chr, 614-15) Theran ash has been found outside the boundaries of the M settlement of Trianda at the following plots: Liame (KM 742- Ag. Georgios); St. Tziortze swimming pool; Karanikola bothros (KM 41); Georgiou bothros (KM 308); Ar. Tzore bothros (KM 21g). LM IA sherds were generally found beneath the tephra layers, which varied in thickness from .18 to .03m. Kattavia. The Danish Institute at Athens and the National Museum of Denmark, in collaboration with the Ephoreia (Dr Effy Karantzaly) completed the first campaign in a series of surveys in the surroundings of Kattavia in the S part of Rhodes. An area of 5km2 around the modem village of Kattavia was examined. The valley around the modem village has a flat alluvial fill in its centre, without ancient cultural remains, probably indicating the presence of a lake in antiquity and later. Ancient settlements are placed on the sloping uplands surrounding the ancient lake. The valley is edged by low mountains. Architectural remains were sparsely preserved. From the concentration of sherds it is clear that the ancient centre of the Lindian demos was situated on a flat hill E of the lake, where a few ancient foundations were located. On the W uplands a strong concentration of LR-ECh sherds (4th-5th Cts) was found, and rock-cut tombs (recently emptied) where skeletons and whole pots were still to be seen in the collective mass graves. In a small valley along the N side a huge production centre for Rhodian amphoras was found, the finds covering the period 2nd Ct BC-2nd Ct AD. Epipalaeolithic remains were found and N stone tools were plentiful. In addition to the Myc ChTs excavated by Kinch in 1907, more tombs and traces of Myc settlements were recorded. A fair number of sherds of relief decorated pithoi were found in the valley, attesting to the presence of EA habitation, and an astonishing amount of material from the later A and Cl periods, among which decorated sherds from Bf and Rf vases were collected. Lots of HL material, not much ER but plenty of LR and later material was found in the valley. Lindos. Conservation works are reported in ADelt 43 Chr, 631-633 with particular reference to the acropolis. Pylon. The press reported the discovery in a ChT tomb of linen fabric on the remains of a woman aged about 29, and dated to the 2nd half of the 2nd millennium BC. Trianda. Rescue excavations at 12 building plots are reported in ADelt 43. Most of the remains were of HL date, but also notable were A remains beneath HL on the Lagou plot, close to the A tombs originally excavated by the Italians. During building of a hotel in 1988, at Vagies, two reservoirs of HL date were excavated. Further S, at Aphantou, an important HL metallurgical installation was located during road widening. At Kolybia, near Archangelos (KM 270), hotel construction on the Acheimastos plot in 1988 revealed volcanic ash mixed with sandy brown soil .2-.5m thick. A pure level of tephra, .2-.25m thick lay on a level with unpainted LM IA sherds. At Archangelos itself (Panathura), a cist grave con- tained only a HL bronze mirror. A trench for the drainage system at Monolithos, a late 4th Ct BC ChT is reported. CENTRAL CRETE (23rd Ephorate) Chersonesos. This is one of the most complex areas for the Ephorate, due to the rate of building. The excavation of the I. Pechunake-N. Drakopoulou plot (AR 1993-94, 73) was con- tinued in 1988, with further investigations of the building complex on the E side just W of the theatre. Three building phases were represented: ER, MR and ECh. The great volume of 4th-7th Ct AD pottery may be one indicator of a ceramic production area nearby. Most of the building complex, includ- ing the circular structure, belongs to the late Ist-early 2nd Cts AD with some earlier walls (1st Ct BC-lst Ct AD). A HL tomb (I) may help pinpoint the location of the HL cemetery. (ADelt 43 Chr, 527) A small test in 1988 in the theatre yielded a N-S wall and pottery belonging to the beginning of the 1st Ct AD in the lowest layer. The details of Belli's plan have not yet been verified in full. Gortyn. A. di Vita reports on the work of the Italian School: "Apart from the excavation of the great Ch basilica of the Metropolis, work continued on the excavation of road 43 W of the Praetorium, together with study of material found in previous years. Built into the wall of a drain of the 7th Ct AD a well-preserved male head was found, of the 2nd Ct AD, which had been turned into a portrait in the time of Constant- ine. During the study of the area W of the Metropolis we cleared the Gr and later R theatre on the W side of the acropolis, and with successive trenches and cleaning work we located a large plateia above. This was arc-shaped, at a height greater than 5m, between the theatre and the Metropolis on the E and the present road to Moires, which covers the S part of the arc. It forms a new important monumental structure of the 2nd Ct AD on the S side of the acropolis, which should form a unity with the old Gr theatre, which was reused in the imperial period." Herakleion. The press reported the discovery of a religious site (temple) of the late 6th Ct BC, as well as G buildings at Smari Pediades. Juktas (Temenos). Excavations continued in 1988, concentrat- ing on the NW unexcavated area and area Q 1, as well as deep soundings in terraces I and II. Evidence for a MM IIIB destruction was found in the N, and the first major building programme is placed at the end of MM II-III. (Kretike Estia 3, 280-282) Kastelli (Pediada). From 1988-1991 G. Rethemiotakes con- tinued excavations on building plots here that were begun in 1987 (AR 1993-94, 74). In 1988, new areas of the large LM I structure were uncovered, as well as a paved processional way with two phases corresponding to those of the building. LM III walls lay on top; a stepped altar belongs to an earlier phase. Inside the building, a possible shrine, or its store, dmenostrated the two main phases: MM III/LM IA and LM IB. The LM IA phase had a plaster floor and walls with frescoes; in LM IB, the room was divided in two and the walls covered in white plaster. LM IIIC vases of the later building were recovered. (Kretike Estia 3, 282-283) In 1989, yet more evidence for the LM IA phase beneath LM IB was found. Scattered post-M remains (HL, Byz) are mentioned in Kretike Estia 4, 286-287. In 1991, other building plots were investigated: on the Stavroulake plot, the corner of a MM IB-II building was uncovered; at Plateia Meintani, two successive phase of Old Palace period remains came to light, with much MM IA to MM II pottery as well as some N. A thick wall was traced for 25m on the Perake plot; this may relate to the main building in Plateia Ag. Georgios, since it has the correct orientation. A group of buildings in the Kampitake plot belong to the Old and New Palace periods. (Kretike Estia 4, 288)</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 61 Knossos. In 1993 important conservation work was carried out by the Ephorate both in the Domestic Quarter and the South House. The Ephorate, assisted by the BSA, opened a number of trenches in relation to this work. A new drainage system was installed along the N and E sides of the South House. The original LM drainage channel discovered by A. Evans was recovered. Trench X, opened by J.D. Evans in 1959, was traced, and more EN levels excavated; these proved to include floor levels indicating that formal occupation existed on the S side of the mound at this early date. At the S end of the E trench, a deep sounding revealed a strange structure which may have been a built drain or stepped ramp; its connexion with the S House could not be ascertained. A number of trials also took place on the S side of the S House. The most interesting discovery here was a series of small hollows cut in the N, at the time when the pillar base- ment of the LM I house was built; at least two hollows had contained handleless cups. A mason's mark (a star) was found on the lowest gypsum course of the S interior wall of the basement. Cleaning for the construction of new terraces N of the S House revealed N levels as well as a massive fill of EM IIA date. A N kiln also came to light here. BSA excavations by the HL kilns (Knossos Survey 178). At the request of the Ministry of Culture, the School undertook five trial trenches on two terraces on the SE slopes of Monasti- raki Kefala, 100m N of the so-called 'Acropolis Houses'. Two HL kilns were already known here. Test 4 revealed a remark- ably complete square kiln with furnace chamber and central pillar intact; it was built into the side of the modem terracing. Test 2 uncovered a complex industrial area of HL date. Both these features require further investigation. Test 1 contained a HL or R terrace wall in the E, and M remains in the W. The small area excavated down to M levels brought to light a deposit of vases, apparently destruction clearance, which included a handmade vase inscribed with four Linear A signs and good examples of MM IIIB pottery which may well be early LM IA in date. Mature LM IA levels to the N contained much of a fine 'lily' fresco which awaits conservation; the walls to which it was attached have not yet been discovered. Above the MM III-LM I remains was a wall associated with LM II-IIA pottery. Bedrock was reached in tests 3 and 5, the pottery being somewhat undiagnostic MM III; study and broader excavation should clarify this. The entire area was clearly an important HL industrial complex, perhaps specifically devoted to ceramic production. The M remains complement the evidence recovered from the excavation of the 'Acropolis Houses' and deserve further investigation in view of the finds thus far, and the fact that the land has not been destroyed through deep ploughing. Kommos. J. and M. Shaw report: "This summer work was concentrated on further clarifica- tion of the monumental ashlar buildings in the civic area S of the E-W M road (Fig. 28). There are two civic buildings here. The larger is LM I building T, palatial in style, with four wings set round a central court, the original ensemble being some 6,000m square, larger than the palace at Kato Zakro but smaller than that at Phaistos. Upon E wing of T was set, during LM IIIA2, building P, composed of six huge galleries facing the seashore. We have interpreted these as having been used for storage, in particular the storage of ships during the winter, non-sailing months. The gallery interiors are characterized by earth and clay floors, singed in places. In these have been found many fragments of short-necked amphoras that probably contained exportable commodities. The highlight of the season was the full exposure of a monumental LM I stoa facing the central court of T from the S. It originally consisted of six wooden columns set upon cylindrical stone bases (.47-.63m diam.) set with an intercolumniation of 3.35m. The floor of the stoa (much destroyed) seems to have been of earth, while that of the court (.2m thick) was made of successive layers of sea pebbles, the lowest and best floor being made of lime and pebbles. On the the stoa is adjacent to a room with doors and piers along its W facade. The room could be entered from the stoa as well as from the S, where a doorway led into building T. A structure along the W edge of room 46 is almost certainly part of a staircase (1.66m wide), possibly with wooden steps. From here one could reach the upper storey over the E wing of building T and possibly also a loggia, directly above the newly dis- covered stoa of the ground floor. Another possible staircase (.95m wide) exists at the W end of the stoa. Though evidence is still incomplete, there are indications that the stoa just described had a predecessor, but whether still LM IA or earlier is not yet known, since a lower pebble floor was reached in connection with the fifth and sixth column bases from the E only on the last day of excavation. Soundings need to be made in order to establish the date of the floor. The LM I stoa was matched by another stoa found exactly across, bordering the N edge of the long rectangular court. The two spaces can now be referred to as the N and S stoas. A pleasing situation in this year's excavation is that the S stoa is not obscured by later construction on top, as in the case of the N stoa, parts of which lie under later M and even Greek strata and walls. The symmetry between the two stoas is seen also in the matter of dimensions which are very similar (cf the intercolum- niations of 3.27m [N] versus 3.35m [S]; and the depth of the stoa is 5.20m [N] versus 5.26m [S]). Their main difference is on the W, where the N stoa ends with a pier and a paved court or light-well, while the S stoa has a sixth column instead of the pier. Arrangements of adjoining spaces also differ. The overall plan of two deep stoas facing each other across a broad court is not exactly matched in other M palaces, but then variations in details of plan and general appearance are not atypical in such formal buildings. Here is another example of the M architect's desire to vary the proportion and placement of elements of their architectural vocabulary. Building T, with its palatial plan and huge size, constitutes an important addition to existing archaeological evidence for the political and economic development in the W Messara plain, where T should be considered along with the two other large establishments at Hagia Triada and Phaistos. Questions immediately arise as to the nature of interconnections between, and relative roles of, these three sites, especially in the LM IA period, when T was built, used and then largely deserted. Does T represent an independent community's attempt to rival the centre at Phaistos? Or was it originally intended by the rulers of the W Messara to replace the first palace at Phaistos after it was destroyed, and before the new one was constructed? Or was T designed primarily as a seaside trading and/or distribu- tion centre set next to the largest contemporary settlement along the Messara shoreline? These questions will be investi- gated in future study seasons. The N stoa collapsed during LM I, after which part of it became a centre for bronze working. A similar utilitarian fate befell the S stoa, for still during LM IA a large pottery kiln was built against the stoa's S wall. The kiln is roughly oval in shape, ca 5.60m (max) E-W and ca 4.00m (max) N-S. The firing pit, cut down below the stoa's floor, was entered from</page><page sequence="62">62 R. A.

Out from it lead four U-shaped channels or flues, sloping up to the E, with the tops of the walls between them forming three long narrow flat platforms that were coated with clay. The same type of clay was used as revetment for the firing pit and flues. Presumably the kiln was enclosed by a dome built of rubble and clay, of which pieces have been found midway down in the firing pit. Unfortunately there was only ash, rather than carbon fragments, found in the firing pit and the exterior dumps, with the result that, despite intensive water sieving, the fuel used to fire the kiln (e.g. wood, brush, olive production refuse) cannot be specified, although phyto- liths may be identified in ashy residue from the kiln in the future. In LM IIIA2, long after the kiln had gone out of use in LM IA, two clay ovens were built immediately to its S. The multiple flue type of M kiln just described has been found elsewhere, as at nearby LMI Hagia Triada (five chan- nels), at LM IB Knossos near the Stratigraphic Museum (five channels), and at MM III Kato Zakro (four channels). Nowhere else, however, is it as clear as at Kommos that the major function of a kiln of this type was to fire pottery. In the Kommos kiln, for instance, there is no trace of lime production (as at one of the Knossos kilns), or the smelting of metal (claimed for the Zakro kiln). For at least 5m E, W, and N of the kiln, and obviously associated with it, were found extensive dumps with wasters and decorated and undecorated pottery of various shapes and sizes. There are smaller shapes (cups, bowls), also medium sized (bridge-spouted jars, jugs, kalathoi, and pitharakia), and larger ones (amphoras and elongated jars). There were also fragments of circular terracotta slabs that were probably used as temporary platforms for pots during their manufacture. Of the kiln's four flues, three were emptied. They contained fallen pieces of the clay kiln lining, small fragments looms destroyed ty se</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 63 of stone slabs (perhaps from the dome) and dozens of conical cups. This assemblage will form the basis for a special ceramic, chemical and petrographic study, for the pottery material can in this unusual case be shown to belong to a particular M production centre. The kiln itself will receive attention from the points of view of firing procedures as well as of archaeomagnetic dating." Lenta (anc. Lebena, Kainourgio) (AR 1993-94, 79). In 1988- 89, twelve building plots were investigated. In nine of these walls of such substance occurred that they should belong to public buildings serving visitors to the Sanctuary of Asclepius. Construction of such installations appears to belong to the 2nd to 3rd Cts AD, with abandonment in the 5th-6th Cts. Singled out for mention is a part of a rich building with a central hall and polychrome mosaic floor. Nearby, on the hill of Anginaro- papouro, a test excavation was carried out and the existence of the EM settlement confirmed. Matala (AR 1993-94, 79). Two rescue excavations and one investigation of the north cemetery took place in 1988 (ADelt 43 Chr, 534-540). On the Eu. Sphakaki plot, excavations begun in 1987 were completed. Walls of LR date were found above remains of fills of ER date. The complex comprised three roofed areas with white plastered walls, preserved to a height of 2m on the S side, sometimes with red bands. Finds were few, but included amphoras and glass vessels of the LR or ECh era; one quarter of a fine marble circular table (R) is notable (ADelt 43 Chi, 538). The I. and Ei. Kadianake plot lies N of the main road and stream. Here, 12 tests were carried out which were productive only in the case of Test II, where a LR destruction was observed, beneath which lay LHL and some C, including Attic rf, the earliest pottery yet found at Matala. (ADelt 43 Ch-, 538) The cemetery on the S and SE slopes of the Nesos promontory comprises ChTs cut into the rock. Although the tombs have long been used and robbed by tourists, cleaning and excavation is productive. Tomb I still contained a series of burials in rock-cut cists or pits covered with stone slabs. The pits were full of bones-men, women and children. Grave goods were poor, although 88 whole pots were recovered, mostly of local manufacture. Dating was difficult, but the material appears to belong chiefly to LR and ECh. Phaistos. Further excavations were carried out by the Italian School, under the direction of V la Rosa, who reports: "The main excavation had as its object the area W of rooms XCIV-XCV, at the limit of the excavation of 1966. The trench, slightly smaller than 12 x 2.5/3m, revealed a deposit of more than 4m with complex stratigraphy from H to N. At the N of the trench was located, but not completely excavated, a building of the PG period, which we called NN, with two floor levels and the remains of hearths but without actual finds. The site of the room, long and narrow, was covered in its turn (between the LG and O periods) by a stone floor, above which was placed a strange building of upright slabs, the purpose of which is not very clear. The most significant episode in the stratigraphy is identified with a deposit located in 1964-66 which is the equivalent of our levels 17 and 17c. A closer investigation of its nature, its mobility and the chronology of the material enables us to confirm the following: the deposit cannot be identified with the 'great landslide' (in accordance with Doro Levi's hypothesis); the greater part of it is formed from the crushing and rubbing together of poured plaster which Fig. 29 contained stones, small pieces of clay, lime, fragments of plaster, ash, etc. A great part of the ceramic material has clear traces of an incrustation of the same very hard material, the use of which, as far as concerns the area of the palace, had been defined by Doro Levi. This plaster had poured out only during the time when the pottery in use was that of the end of MM IIB (which corresponds to the destruction of the first palace of Phaistos by earthquake and fire) since all the material found in the deposit is dateable to that time. The pouring of the plaster can be connected directly with the effort to rebuild the palace (since we have not so far found anything of this sort in connection with private houses). This effort (as was seen in earlier excavations) ended badly during the time of MM IIA pottery. The destruction and the removal and depositing of the plaster happened during LM IA. This is demonstrated by some 12 fragments found along with the unlimited quantity of MM IIIB. The occasion for the removal of the plaster was the new plan, which was finally completed for the building of the second palace of Phaistos, which thus must be dated to LM IA. At the end of the work it was considered worthwhile, in order to avoid subsidence, to pour a small amount of the plaster in situ, using the same material that was in the deposit (layer 12). Below the deposit a new series of rooms (CVIII-CXIV) came to light (Figs. 29, 30). These belong to a house which has not yet been completely excavated. We were able to observe four main architectural phases: the earliest is MM IB (contemporary with the building of the first palace), and the other three follow each other during MM II, the two latest dateable to MM IIB. The time of the final catastrophe, evidently as a result of the same earthquake that brought down the early palace, is evident from a floor with alabaster paving slabs, most of which have come apart and are tilted. In one of the rooms (CX) a brazier was found stuck in the floor. Among the objects found there was a pear shaped sealing, the seal of which was a 6-pointed star. In room CIX a splendid round</page><page sequence="64">64 R. A. TOMLINSON F94 72 50 I Fig. 30 offering table was found (diam. ca 70cm) with a central cavity. Around the rim is an impressed double anthemion decoration." In 1988, at the site of Gria Saita, SE of the palace hill, illegal destruction left little for the archaeologist. However, rescue work revealed evidence for an extensive HL and ER installation with pithoi; a distinctive clay piece of equipment, related to the drains, was painted with the letters A, B, F (ADelt 43 Chr, 531). Olives and other seeds were found inside the pithoi and taken to Heraklion Museum for analysis. In general terms, the discoveries here were important for the extent of the HL settlement of Phaistos. Illegal digging at the site of Plakes between Pitsidia and Kamilari (AR 1993-94, 80) had revealed Old Palace and New Palace pottery and walls. Tests in 1988 revealed parts of a farmstead which is illustrated in plan in ADelt 43 Chr, 533. Fallen stones and clay facing appeared to have come from the upper storey. The east entrance led onto a staircase. Finds were few, but included a pithos with trickle decoration and two LM vases. Tripete (Kainourgio). At Adame Korphali, A. Vasilakis has thus far excavated 46 rooms and given a preliminary report in Archaiologia 30 (1989). Pottery reported from the 1988 season includes Ag. Onouphrios ware and other EM I through to MM IA. 1989 saw the completion of the excavation of the prepalat- ial settlement and the start of its conservation. In Kretike Estia 4, 292-96, the functions of various rooms are described, notably one (46) for storing murex shells. Conservation ended in 1991 when the excavation of the protopalatial settlement on the Phylakas promontory began. First thought to be a tholos (Kretike Estia 3, 287), the site is, in fact, a MM II settlement (Kretike Estia 4, 295). EASTERN CRETE (24th Ephorate) The important Minoan Roads project (AR 1993-94, 83) has detected ancient (mostly M) roads and other features (e.g. 'guard' towers) in E Crete, and has attempted to document the potential elements of a sophisticated communication (?defens- ive) system. The project has a pilot programme to concentrate on surface survey and some excavation in the following areas and sites: Chochlakies, Lidoryako, Epano Zakro, the Zeros plain, Karoumes, Analouka, Chamaizi, Praisos as well as the Lasithi area close to Kritsa. Work from 1988-1991 and notes on dates for construction, use and destruction are to be found in Kretike Estia 3, 299-300; 4, 306-319. Atsipadhes Korakias Peak Sanctuary A. Peatfield reports: "(1) Spili Vorizi. The peak sanctuary of Vorizi is located just below and NW of the summit of the mountain. As with other peak sanctuaries this seems to be associated with the view. The site of the peak sanctuary has a better view down onto the modern village where the M settlement seems to have been. A 2m grid was used to plot the approximate densities of pebbles, figurines and sherds in relation to the natural rock features. Using this it was possible to determine certain areas of differential activity on the site. Unlike Atsipadhes Korakias, the natural topography of Vorizi is not clearly defined. Therefore it was not possible to associate densities of material with especially distinct rock formations. Rather more signifi- cant are densities associated with viewpoints. One area of dense material is just on the N edge of the site, where the lines of sight W to Atsipadhes Korakias and E to the horned peak of Mt. Ida are best. The finds are similar to those of Atsipadhes Korakias. Some human figurine fragments were visible, but not many. A little more obvious were animal figurines, especially fragments of cattle. The pottery consisted mainly of bridge- spouted jars, conical cups and open dishes, but other shapes, especially lamps and larger storage vessels are notable for their absence. The chronology of the site is broadly similar to that of Korakias-EM III-MM I, but there is a possibility of later material, into MM III. (2) Agios Vasilios Valley Survey. In 1991 380 sherd scatters were located, 88 of which had BA material. Of these 57 were revisited in 1994, recording 42 in detail. The chrono- logical breakdowns were as follows: EM sites: EM material was recognized at fifteen scatters, at Phonisses, Ambelos, Moule, and Phrati West. Preliminary dating suggests an early phase of EM, possibly even FN-EM I, which is contemporary with the earliest material from the peak sanctuary. So far only one rim of EM II type has been identified (at Phonisses). The rarity of EM II in the survey region may be because the Agios Vasilios valley is landlocked. EM sites are reported towards the coast, in the Plakias/Preveli area. Protopalatial and Neoplatial sites: Unexpectedly, MM I-II sites are also rare. Excluding the peak sanctuary, unambiguous MM finds come from only six scatters, at Phrati Crag, Koule,'- Smith', and tou aloniou to lakko. Phrati is the top of a precipi- tous crag with excellent views down the Kourtaliotiko Gorge. It probably functioned as a vigla for a settlement in the vicinity, the latter probably at Koule. The Koule is the largest MM site identified in the survey area. It is favourably situated with good views up and down the valley, abundant water, arable land, and pasture. The Koule also connects visually with the Atsipadhes peak sanctuary, a point revealed as significant in topographic studies of peak sanctuaries. MM material is spread over an area of 250 x 125m, but the site has been deeply disturbed several times since the BA, making it difficult to estimate the extent of the prehistoric settlement. Investigation of the site revealed three scraps with stratified MM pottery. Although the 'Smith' site contains MM and LM pottery, the nature of the material suggests that it may have been brought in from elsewhere and dumped, probably as part of the earth fill when the terraces were built up. Tou Aloniou to Lakko was investigated when first dis- covered in 1991. Full recording will take place in 1996. Neverthheless it can be reported that MM material was found on the lower S slopes of the site, where exposed in a road cut. I </page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 The site's main occupation phase is LM I-III. Foundations of at least fourteen structures were observed and mapped in 1991. Neopalatial material was recognized at 11 of the 52 scatters investigated this year. This represents a 100 percent increase in activity areas between the Proto- and Neopalatial periods. Most of the new sites are small, probably no more than one or two houses. The emerging settlement pattern in the Agios Valley suggests some sort of socio-political change at the beginning of EM II and another at the end of the Protopalatial period. The first initiated a period of strong nucleation or abandon- ment, while the second encouraged a less nucleated population distribution and possibly the abandonment of the Korakias peak sanctuary. The latter is not the typical pattern in other survey areas, where the Protopalatial period material is highly dispersed and the Neopalatial slightly less so, e.g. Chania, Akrotiri, Vrokastro, Kavousi. This latter chronological horizon has already been observed at the Atsipadhes Korakias peak sanctuary and may be associated with the MM II destructions of Monastiraki and Apodoulou. The survey does not support the hypothesis of some socio-political 'event' suffered by this part of Crete at this time. Post-palatial sites: LM IIIA-B 'material was recognized at four scatters. Further study of the pottery will probably increase the count. EIA and EGr sites: A feature of Agios Vasilios Valley and its surrounding hills are EIron Age sites. The largest and most complex of these is Phrati Kephala. The hilltop is steep and blanketed with deep sediments, which may suggest that most of Phrati Kephala is still buried. Nearby is Phrati East where ancient walls are exposed amid a dense sherd scatter. Phoniss- es, also large and complex, has high densities of sherds and building stone, with visible ancient walls. Eleven EIron Age scatters and twelve EGreek scatters were mostly within the Ambelos and Koule areas." Basilike. The work of A. Zoes is reported in Ergon. Sherds of Koumasa style were found, with painting of dolphins in silhouette, a motif which would be repeated ages later in the LM I period, in wall paintings with marine themes, such as the wall painting of the dolphins at the palace of Knossos. Excava- tion was concerned with the completion of trenches to provide stratigraphical evidence. Chalasmeno. W. Coulson (ASCS) and M. Tsipopoulou continued their collaboration in 1994. In all six trenches were excavated in two sections of the site. In section A the outer wall of unit 1 was revealed. In section B the excavation of four new rooms which had been started in 1993 was completed, and the superficial level was removed in two other trenches. An especially interesting find was a circular or apsidal building, with stones in its interior, above the LM III room in section b, which was cleaned but not completely excavated. It is not clear whether this is a Pg building or a tholos tomb. Significant finds from this year's excavations were several pithoi and smaller vases, stone tools, and a terracotta figurine of a ram. Also interesting were fragmants of MM stone jars, the remains most plausibly of an earlier settlement of the place. Another three rooms were found at Kataleimata, with finds of pottery and stone tools. Especially interesting was the location of MM and N strata. It remains to be seen from future excavations whether these can be linked to architectural remains. Gournia project. The director, L. Watrous reports: "The principal goal of the project was to document the natural environment of the M town and the history of settle- ment in its region as a background for understanding the site and its economic and political relations. An intensive archae- ological survey was carried out over an area of 9km2 in the Isthmus of Ierapetra. The survey covered the valley floor and E mountain slope of the Isthmus between the villages of Monasteraki, Episkopi, and Kato Chorio. H. Blitzer carried out an ethnographic study involving the villages of Monasteraki, Epano Chorio and Episkopi. Her study focused on the traditional agricultural subsistence system and its relationship to the local economy and trade, including an analysis of landscape manipulation via terrace construction, damming and channeling of water, maquis clearance, and the domestication and planting of fruit trees and dry crops. Results of this study include: identification of terraces as social artefacts, definition of local olive domestication and its probable relationship to ancient practices, and an understanding of the basic economic priorities in local land use. Using this ethnographic data it is now possible to establish the amount of land necessary to support the ancient settlements found by the archaeological survey. Traditional storage practices for food stuffs were documented. Patterns of trade between the Isthmus of Ierapetra and the Aegean/East Mediterranean were identified by means of local economic data and written records. During the 1994 field season, the archaeological survey identified 87 new sites, bringing the total in the area to 156. Two final N/EM I sites, a cave site and an open settlement, were identified in the mountains E of Episkopi. Many small EB sites were discovered, particularly on hilltops removed from the valley floor. As usual, M and LM sites were found to be densely distributed across the local landscape. Three examples can be singled out for mention; a megalithic farm- house built high (542m) above the valley and two EM/MM 'refuge settlements' fortified with Cyclopean walls. The settlement was associated with the LM III cemetery (excavated by Seager, Xanthoudides and Platon) and the well-known Episkopi lamax was located. An extremely large LM IIIC-C settlement was recorded on the peak of Profitis Elias, S of Episkopi. Abandoned in the early 5th Ct BC, this site is almost certainly the Greek city state of Larisa, mentioned by Strabo (IX 5. 19), whose citizens were forced to resettle in the city of Ierapytna (mod Ierapetra) on the S coast. A large number of R sites were found, principally farmsteads, several with their giant stone oil crushing beds (trapetum) still intact. Finally, the survey also identified many Byz, Venetian and Ott period settlements." Itanos. A. Kalpaxis and D. Viviers report: "The programme of research has two aspects, the town and its territory. The principal aims are: work on the archive of data from the earlier excavations (in 1899 and 1950 by the French School); production of a topographical plan of the urban centre; close exploration of the urban perimeter; and general survey of the territory of the city, from a line linking Cape Mavromouri to Palaikastro up to Cape Sidhero. The archive produced plans of the visible remains of Basilica A, and its E-W profile, of part of the area of habita- tion excavated in 1950, and the topographical position of Basilica B, the Grand Tomb, dug in 1950, and the Tomb of the Beach. A topographical plan of the urban perimeter was prepared, by photogrammetry, to a scale of 1/500. Basilica A (Fig. 31) was cleared to permit architectural planning and the study of the monument. This made possible, among other 65</page><page sequence="66">66 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 31 things, a new dating of the building to the 9th Ct AD, a better understanding of the W terrace and the method of access to the narthex by two staircases, the uncovering of the end of the choir (Fig. 32), and of an atrium. We also studied the reused blocks in the monument and made a catalogue of them, as well as the architectural blocks around Basilica A. We also explored the terraces which organize the space between the two acropolises, found the evidence for the existence and limits of an interior harbour (Fig. 33), and, without doubt, those of the agora, thanks to the clearing of modern walls and an electromagnetic survey carried out by the Polytechnic of Crete. Three fragmentary inscriptions were discovered and studied, of which two are certainly HL in date. Finally, the survey of the S hill has made it possible to trace the rampart, which is still almost entirely visible in the S part of the ancient town, includilng the low areas where we used electro magnetic detection to do this. Part of the territory of the ancient city was explored. Two scattered rural places of habitation were found in the countryside, Vamies and at the foot of Travouni, comprising enclosures, terraces,and on occasion access roads (Fig. 34). Several terrace systems were studied in the immediate vicinity of the town, both to N and S. A suburban sanctuary (Fig. 35) was found. In it were the foundations of an altar (?) 5.20 x ca 8m, as well as a large peribolos of Cyclopaean masonry and a system of cultivation terraces close to the site; the type of material found on the surface seems to us to point to a cult function (lamps, figurines etc.), while the date of it attests to occupation at least between the 8th and 1st Cts BC." In 1989 formal excavation began of the HL cemetery, which had been known since the 1950s (BCH (1951), 193). Twenty- seven tombs, several looted, were investigated and notes on some of these are to be found in Kretike Estia 4, 303-304. Kavousi. The work of the ASCS in 1994 concentrated upon site consolidation at both the lower settlement at Vronda and the upper one of the Kastro. On Vronda, the consolidation and conservation of buildings A/B, E, G (the shrine), H, I-O-N, and L were completed. All walls belonging to these buildings were stabilized; parts of room 2 in building E were backfilled with soil and small stones to the level of the LM IIIC floors, and the W side of room 2 in building G was similarly backfilled to the level of the floor still preserved on the E. Architectural, stratigraphic, and ceramic studies continued, as well as studies of the stone tools, animal bones and seeds. Conservation of the pottery and metal objects also took place; the metal objects from the graves of the LG cremation cem- etery are now nearly all processed. Based on the material which has been studied to date, we can reconstruct more fully the use of the Vronda site, and the following periods have been identified: Final N; EM IIB-EM III (deposits below building E); MMII (deposits all over the summit and slopes indicate extensive habitation in this period); LM IIIC (the majority of buildings belong to this period); SM-PG (building E continued in use); LG-EO (the cemetery); LO (in building I-O-N); Byz (8- 9th Cts AD); and Byz/Venetian (the farmstead at Xerambela). On the Kastro the conservation of all walls was completed by the consolidation of rooms 1-13 which had been dug by Harriet Boyd in 1900. The consolidation of the Kastro is thus complete; all that remains is the backfilling of the bedrock surfaces in some of the rooms, since the bedrock is very friable and tends to chip quite easily. The fence around the site was repaired in those places which had been torn by shepherds and goats during the winter. Study also continued on the finds from the Kastro, includ- ing the pottery, stone tools, animal bones and seeds. Major effort was spent on the study of the LM IIIC pottery from the</page><page sequence="67">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 Fig. 34 Fig. 35 Fig. 32 Fig. 33 W slope and NW building complex. Three phases of LM IIIC were isolated in preliminary work done in 1991. These were studied in more depth. Phase I was found to contain some pottery with LM IIIB characteristics, so it appears that the earliest phase on the Kastro is transitional from IIIB to IIIC. Phase III pottery has the character of a late phase of IIIC, comparable to that from Vronda. Phase II, not unexpectedly, contains elements of both the earlier and late phases. It thus seems that the Kastro had an unbroken sequence of habitation throughout the LM IIIC period. It is hoped to study the Pg, G and O levels in future seasons. Mochlos. The Greek-American excavations directed by J. Soles and C. Davaras continued in 1994 at four different locations: on the island of Mochlos, behind the modern village on the coast opposite, in the LM III cemetery above the village, and at the site of Chalinomouri at the E end of the Mochlos plain. On the island the excavation succeeded in pinpointing the date of the fort, identified last year, to the 2nd and 1st Cts BC, a little earlier than previously thought, and probably too early for Q. Caecilius Metellus; it discovered an imported PC oinochoe underneath this fort on the top of the island, revealing a hitherto unsuspected period at Mochlos. It also uncovered additional remains of the M settlement dating to the EMII, EM III, MM IB/II and LMIB periods and additional remains of the Myc reoccupation. LMIIIA/1 pottery, found last year in the cemetery, was found this year in the settlement, and it now appears thast the reoccupation began in this period. This reoccupation was more extensive than Seager reported it to be, and the excavations this summer uncovered remains of three more structures in addition to the large house in the E part of the site, House A, and the two smaller structures already 67</page><page sequence="68">68 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 36 Fig. 38 Fig. 37 Fig. 39 uncovered to the W. Some of these LM III houses sit above the earlier LM IB buildings, while others are constructed against pre-existing LM IB walls, and with the exception of House A they are quite modest in appearance. On the coast the project completed the excavation of the LM IB industrial quarter, uncovering additional evidence for stone-vase making and pottery production in building B. The small, two channeled kiln discovered last year was completely excavated, and a second kiln with a single firing chamber was found nearby; the stoking chambers of both were full of olive pits, a fuel which is still used in Cretan kilns today. The excavation also completed work on the LM IB farmhouse at Chalinomouri, exploring the area outside and around the farmhouse as well where the remains of terrace walls and a large clay-lined oven are located. In the LM III cemetery behind the modern village of Mochlos, excavation uncovered 13 more tombs, most of them containing pithos burials. This brings the total number of tombs discovered to 29, including the nine opened by Papadakis in 1986. They show a remarkable number of variations in the design of the tomb, in the burial container, and in the grave goods, and these mortuary variations should reflect variations in the living population and in the social stratification of the LM III population on the island. One of the tombs discovered this year was particularly interesting because it was reopened in the LG and EO period, and votive gifts of pottery were placed inside on top of the earlier LM III burial. Myrtos-Pyrgos. G. Cadogan directed a season of cleaning and consolidation, coupled with an intense search in the part of the LM I country house at the top of the hill (Figs. 36, 37), where an important clay roundel with seal impressions and Linear A signs (now in the Agios Nikolaos Museum) was found on the surface in August 1993, in case there should be any more such documents (Figs. 38, 39). None was found, but the cleaning revealed evidence for an earlier phase, probably of Pyrgos III Old Palace period date, of the country house, as well as likely evidence for a second building phase in LM I when repairs were carried out. On the upper east slope of the hill some baulks were excav- ated, and tests were made beside the MM tower on the north slope, to check various details that had arisen in study of the finds. Cleaning and consolidation of the M walls was concen- trated on the lower west slope, where the damage from rainwater has been worst over the years since the original excavation. The appearance of the site has now been considerably improved. Other tasks at Pyrgos included tidying, studying and drawing the fragments of gypsum and mud brick, and a survey of the different types of stone used in the settlement. Dr J. Driessen began an architectural study. Study of finds continued at Knossos.</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 Palaikastro. This year's excavation (Fig. 40), led by Dr J.A. MacGillivray and L.H. Sackett, was devoted entirely to work in the area of building 6, partly revealed in 1990-1. Work extended to all quarters of this building and the chronology was refined. The most interesting architectural features were found in the SE quarter, where a monumental entrance, almost certainly opening out onto the N branch of the 1902-6 'Main Street' facing block B, led to a paved central court measuring 7.3 x 10.7m, adjoining a plastered area of similar shape and dimensions, but probably originally subdivided. The paved court was bordered by a pillared colonnade now preserved only on its S side (where two of perhaps six column bases remain in situ), but probably originally continuing round the entire court. Beyond the colonnade on the W was a large paved room, entered by a pier and door system whose piers were placed unusually on cut bases of fine mottled green serpentine. This space was immediately adjacent to the Main Street, but lay, surprisingly, at a lower level than the present street paving (by some 50cm) and probably had no external door on this side. A range of rooms at the NW side of the court remains to be excavated, but they were probably well-appointed, for fine decorated plaster came from the third room from the S, and we note that the fresco with vetch design found in 1991 (and added to this year) had fallen into a space immediately adjacent to the N. On the S side of the court a well-paved drain ran down towards the street dividing building 6 from block B. On the downhill E side the limiting walls, mostly eroded below the LM IA floor level but surviving due to the deep terracing here, indicate that the original MM IIIB-LM IA structure was provided with a massive terrace wall. For all the erosion the remains of the building offer an interpretation of considerable historical and perhaps social interest: there is evidence for earthquake devastation during the LM IA period, followed by general demolition. Walls, columns, and even paving slabs were systematically dismantled and removed, leaving only the SE corer of the colonnade partly in situ, and even here one massive foundation stone had been abandoned partly levered out when the work was interrupted. Onto the resulting pitted surface apparently fell a deposit of volcanic ash or tephra (no doubt to be attributed to the LM IA eruption at Thera-analysis pending). Traces of this were found in four separate locations. Two wells were found in the area, and they were fully excavated. Both had primary deposits of LM IB date, and were constructed then, so do not relate to building 6 but to the succeeding open area. The first, in the SE quarter (Well 605) was well constructed, with a stone lining (diam. 1.2m) to depth 6.5m and cut deeper through the rock to reach bottom at depth 8m. It provided an extremely valuable ceramic sequence of both closed and open shapes, running from LM IB through LM II and LM IIIA to a final rubbish fill of LM IIIA2/B character. In addition, from here comes the fragment of a remarkably fine stone rhyton with scenes of dolphins browsing in a seascape of rocks and seaweed. The second well (Well 576) was found in the central area and was a remarkable, if not monumental affair. Its upper shaft was stone lined to depth c. 2.20m, was oval in shape and measured 2 x 1.5m-so large that it could have served a community rather then a household (perhaps five or six individuals could draw water at the same time; certainly three or four men could stand together at the bottom, and two regularly worked together in the excavation). It provides a very similar chronological sequence to well 605. Included in the mass of pottery (mostly still not studied) was one plain jug with a wide ideogram incised on the handle. But this well has Fig. 40 more to offer, since finds included architectural elements such as sandstone horns of consecration, bull's horns of unusual size and the well itself cut through at least one subterranean chamber or cave (with stalactite formation and a water source) in which finds were also made. The total depth was 9m, but due to water inlets from the rock at a comparatively high level, secondary use in the LM IIIAI period was possible, even after the main shaft was clogged for some metres with LM IB rubble (or perhaps field clearance of old LM IA rubble). In sum, part of an unusual building complex was found, differing in plan (and perhaps then function) from both block B to the SE and from the recently excavated buildings 1-7 to the N. Its history within the LM IA period is instructive, and helps to fill a substantial gap in our understanding of this period at Palaikastro." Petras (Siteia) (AR 1993-94, 82). The following is a summary of the report received from the excavator, M. Tsipopoulou. Work in 1994 had six main objectives: to complete the plan of the LM I building in the NW; to examine the E extension of the N facade; to investigate the E flank of the plateau and the area W and SW of the building; to do limited tests for earlier stratigraphy; and to prepare the area for visitors. Excavation of the NW sector revealed an uneven N facade, turning ESE at a certain point and not joining properly with the E facade. The strange direction of the N facade could be interpreted as an alteration after the LM IA destruction at which time building quality declined. Of great importance is 69</page><page sequence="70">70 R. A. TOMLINSON the further excavation of a burnt deposit with large numbers of conical cups. The vases number more than 750 and although they include no classic LM IB they are dated to that phase because of the occurrence of a sherd from a mainland LH IIA squat alabastron with sacral ivy and swastika. Thirteen test trenches yielded various important pieces of evidence particu- larly for an earlier building, perhaps from MM IB onwards. EM II has been found at numerous points on bedrock. Thirty Byz graves have been excavated so far. Praisos. J. Whitley reports: "The first objective of the 1994 season was to undertake more fieldwalking in the survey area, using the same methods and principles as were employed in 1993. Fieldworking for this season was limited to the area defined by the koinotita of Praisos. The second aim was to undertake an urban survey of Praisos itself. The 1992 plan of Praisos was used to define the natural units of this survey. The third aim was to provide a plan of the natural topography and surviving architectural features of the LMIIIC-PG refuge settlement above Kalamafki, an area known locally as Kipia, using Cardiff's Topcon GTS 303 EDM. Fieldwalking was concentrated on areas adjacent to those walked in 1993 and particularly on the tongue of land leading from the Kapala hill north to Praisos itself. The nature of the terrain (mainly small gardens and terraces) necessitated slow and intensive tract walking. Remains of all periods were encountered. Possible EM (FN-EMI) sherds were identified on the refuge settlement itself, associated with polished stone axes and chipped chert. More MM guard towers, such as site 21, were discovered. Of particular importance was a large structure of MMII date (site 46) with fineware pottery and a terracotta in the form of a woman with a cat sitting on some horns of consecration. MM finds were also encountered close to the Third Acropolis of Praisos itself. More LMIII to G tholos tombs were encountered, some of which can be identified with those excavated by Bosanquet and Platon. G and A sherds were found widely distributed, with a particular concentration in the cave site 23 and on Praisos itself. C and HL finds, in particular loomweights, were very abundant both in Praisos itself and on the northern slopes of the Kapsala hill, indicating that this area must have been a suburb of Praisos in ancient times. Few R finds were encountered, though an Arretine sherd was associated with a possible guard tower. Nothing conclus- ively LR, Arab or Byz could be identified, but we did manage to locate the area of an abandoned metochi of the Venetian period. The urban survey of Praisos revealed interesting differences in the density of occupation between terraces. Most finds were of LC and HL date, but G and A finds were also discovered. The planning of the LM IIIC to PG refuge site at Kipia near Kalamafki was completed. Ancient walls were found on all these hills and the area covered by these walls clearly marks this site out as the largest settlement of its type in Crete." Pseira Project. Under the direction of Philip Betancourt and Costis Davaras, the main projects included architectural drawing and mapping in areas C, D and F, the continuation of topographic mapping in the cemetery area, and study of pottery and other finds. They report: "Pottery study concentrated on area AF, a location with a successic., of MM to LM strata. The architecture here is divided into six phases of occupation: the first and second phases date to MM I-II. The third period, from MM IIB until LM IA, ended with a destruction of the house. In the next period (phases 4 and 5), lasting until LM IB, the building was rebuilt. This period ended with another destruction; the last phase (phase 6) is a reoccupation from LM IIIC. One of the objectives of the season was the mapping and drawing of the M buildings in areas C, D and F. Surveys in previous years had recorded the presence of these structures, and their accurate measurement and new scale drawings complete our plan of the M town. The two areas are on the hill west of the M harbor. Area C was partly excavated by Richard Seager in 1907, but area D is completely unexcavated except for one house, building DA, uncovered by the modem project. For the first time, an accurate picture of the development of the Neopalatial town of Pseira can be traced. Between MM II and LM I, the town of Pseira was transformed from the small village into a town of 60 buildings. An important part of this transformmation was the expansion of the settlement from the peninsula where the MM town was located across the harbor to the opposite hill. Twelve buildings have been recorded on this hill, eight in area C and four in area D. A large terrace west of area D, in area F, probably once sup- ported an additional building. among the visible remains of these structures, many thick, well-constructed walls are apparent, functioning both as terrace walls on the steep hillside and as outside walls of houses. A well-preserved stairway of meta-carbonate slabs in House C-G and two steps of a similar stairway in House C-F indicate traffic flow to upper stories or to higher terrace levels. In the 1993-94 seasons, a topographi- cal plan of the MM I-IIA cemetery area, located west of the town, was prepared. Individual tombs were measured, and scale drawings were produced as well." Trypetos (Siteia). Investigation of the HL city continued in 1988-89 and results are reported in Kretike Estia 3, 290-291 and 4, 302. Of the areas excavated, only some produced evidence for specific use (e.g. the reservoir with hydraulic cement and the storage room). A paved road runs E-W. The clay mould of a female figure in repose was of interest among the large number of clay finds, mostly vases. Importance is also given to the coinage of various unknown mints, as well as those of Melos, Rhodes, Praisos, Chersonisos, Knosos and Ptolemaic Egypt. Vrokastro. B. Hayden and J. Moody (ASCS) report: "The Vrokastro Survey Project study season had two purposes, to continue pottery analyses, especially the fabric or petrographic analysis of sherds collected from sites and on transect; and to complete the recording of ancient to Turkish period sites, in particular the architectural study of a number of early Greek buildings located within sites flanking the Meseleri valley (near the southern extent of the survey region). J. Moody conducted the fabric study, and reviewed 40 boxes of sherds collected from recorded sites within the survey area. This represents approximately one half of the study collection. These sites belong to all periods, from the N to the modem period. 80 separate fabric types were identified within this time range; fabrics of BA and EIA date will be thin- sectioned and the inclusions analysed by Peter Day. The 1994 review of the site pottery by Moody and Hayden, conducted in concordance with the ongoing fabric study, has resulted in a more focused and accurate assessment of two related factors that pertain to site chronology: first, new data concerning the dominant period(s) at each site; second, a more accurate count or division of sherds based on the number of periods represented. At sites such as PN1, PT1 and APbl, for example, a few EM IIB sherds were identified in 1991 and</page><page sequence="71">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 71 1992 based on fabric, but primarily on paint and surface treatment. Fabric analysis has revealed a far greater proportion of EM material from both sites. At PT1, for example, the dominant periods appear to be EM (at the earliest EMII) up to early MM. The EM pottery recognized as a presence in 1991 and 1992, along with Neopalatial and EIA material, is now known as the dominant period from this site. Various fabric types identified were derived from sherds catalogued and dated by the pottery specialists, and from comparison with excavated, stratified material from nearby excavations (Kavousi, Pseira, Mochlos). The EM period, once thought limited to the coastal zone or low-lying areas, now appears to occur at sites as far inland as the Meseleri area; most of these sites are water sources and produce pottery of many later periods. Pottery of EM date also appears to be located along routes, as in the gorge which links Prina (the SW comer of the survey area) to the Istron River valley to the N. Although many BA settlements within the Vrokastro area produce both Protopalatial and Neopalatial pottery, re-examination of the inland, upland sites in the Prophitis Ilias area area, and within the pass between Prina and Meseleri indicates that the dominant period at these inland sites is Neopalatial, with possibly some evidence for LMIII and the EIA. Most Neopalatial activity had previously been associated with the coastal zone, thus the presence of these MM III-LM I inland rural communities adds new data and suggests a different, more balanced interpretation of settlement history during this period. Continuing study of the early Greek and later Greek fabrics, especially from the S part of the survey area, indicate a renewed use of granodiorite as a favourite tempering agent, usually coupled with the use of chaff temper in medium sized storage vessels. In addition to the pottery study and site recording activity, the ground and chipped stone study by H. Dierckx was finished during the 1994 season. Chipped stone (obsidian) was recovered from 25 sites, approximately one twelth of the total sites recovered." Xerokampos (Zeros, Siteia). Excavation of the HL town continued; a preliminary account had appeared in ADelt 39 (1984) 304ff. In 1988, two rooms were excavated, one a storage room, and finds included the clay statuette of a naked man and eight coins, some probably from Chios. (Kretike Estia 3, 292) Ziros. The Ziros Project, directed by Keith Branigan of the University of Sheffield and sponsored by INSTAP, The British Academy, the British School and the University of Sheffield, completed an intensive field survey around the villages of Lamnoni and Katelionas in eastern Crete. Settlement of these small, high upland basins was found to begin in the LN and to be at its most intense in the LM and HL-R periods. Sites of particular interest included a probable EMI-II necropolis, a new peak sanctuary above Lamnoni, a major LM.I house on the hill of Stavromenos near Katelionas, and a rock shelter with material of all periods from EM I to R. The pottery from the survey has been grouped into 80 type fabrics and it is hoped that detailed analysis of these in the study season in 1995 will help to identify changing relationships between these upland areas and the major coastal settlements of eastern Crete over a period of four thousand years. WESTERN CRETE (25th Ephorate) Reports are to be found in ADelt 43 Chr, 545ff and Kretike Estia 3, 243ff. Reports for work in 1989-1991 are in Kretike Estia 4, 199ff. Only brief mention can be made of the most important discoveries during the period covered by these publications (1988-1991). Aptera. In 1987-88 part of the W cemetery of the town was investigated on the G. Kelaide plot. Late 8th/early 7th Ct burials are noted as well as C, HL and R. (Kretike Estia 3, 249) In 1989, six more tombs were found but few grave goods (Kretike Estia 4, 213). The press reported the excavation by the Ephorate of a C peribolos and a public building with a HL Doric colonnade of unfluted columns. Agia Photeine (Amari). Rescue excavations on the E. Kyriak- ake plot in 1990-91 revealed a HL and R settlement complex with various phases. Angeliana (Rethymnon). In 1990, a LM III ChT was excavated about 3km N of the village. The chamber contained ten larnaces and nine larnax lids, as well as 31 pots, whole and fragmentary, which date its use from LM IIIA:2 to mostly LM IIIB:1. Notable amongst the small finds were two spirals of copper wire belonging to a ring of Mainland type. M house remains were located nearby. (Kretike Estia 4, 263-265) Anopole (Sphakia). In 1990, three cist graves were found between the villages of Limnia and Pauliana, dated to lst-2nd Ct AD. In 1991, similar tombs were found during digging of a sewage system at Limnia; finds recovered included HL and the base of glass vase said to be R. Apodoulou (Amari). The Greek-Italian excavations at this MM II complex continued in 1987 to 1991. The MM II complex is thought to be more than an agricultural settlement, because of the amount of storage space, the quality of some of the masonry and the existence of painted plaster. Its destruction is set in MM II, contemporary with Quartier Mu at Mallia. Room-by-room details are given in Kretike Estia 3, 276-278; 4, 275-279. Argyroupole (Rethymnon). Rescue excavation in 1985, 1987- 88, on the plot of the Ecclesiastical Council, is reported in an article in Kretike Estia 3. Rescue work on the I. Bougioukalake plot from 1986-1990 revealed walls and a possible paved road in the lower sector. On the upper terrace, a whole group of rooms was found to have been destroyed in the 4th Ct AD. Earlier phases are of HL/ER date, with a rich deposit of G just above bedrock. (Kretike Estia 4, 237-239) Armenoi (Rethymnon). Excavation continued at the LM III cemetery from 1988 to 1991 under the direction of G. Tzedakis and E. Papadopoulou. Nine ChTs came to light in 1988; of medium size, all were cut as basements into the soft rock. LM IIIA and B vases were found, along with bronze weapons, sealstones and beads of rock crystal, faience, carnelian and glass paste. This brought the total number of tombs from the cemetery to 196. (Kretike Estia 3, 264-5) The three other seasons brought to light 18 ChTs, one underground built tholos, a unique type thus far at Armenoi, and one dromos only. As with other tombs at the cemetery, their date range according to the vases was LM IIIA:1 to LM IIIB. Other finds were similar to those of previous campaigns.</page><page sequence="72">72 R. A. TOMLINSON The tholos yielded a stone with a Linear sign inscribed upon it. (Kretike Estia 4, 235-236) Axos (Rethymnon). Excavations continued at the Panagia site where a late HL house complex had been uncovered in 1986- 87. Destruction debris on the floors yielded HL coins with the head of Zeus on the obverse and the thunderbolt on the reverse. At the Teichio site, excavations continued in 1991 for a second year, bringing to light more of the A to R cemetery. Twenty-two burials only were found but a number of human figurines and reliefs came from fills. Most burials were piles of bones in pits cut in the bedrock, although others were simply laid on the rock or earth. Few grave gifts were found; most of the figurines were A to C in date. (Kretike Estia 4, 266-268) Boukolies (Kisamou). An HL pithos burial was found in 1990, much destroyed. (Kretike Estia 4, 215) Chamaleurio (Rethymnon). Test excavations at Bolane took place in 1990, with a view to uncovering remains of all periods, particularly M, which was being destroyed by deep ploughing and opening of agricultural roads. Five trenches were dug in all. Four in sector 1 revealed a rubbish pit dated by illustrated pottery to EM III/MM IA, as well as a LM IIIC storage area comprising pits such as those found at Sybrita (Amari); a pictorial krater is illustrated. (Kretike Estia 4, 242) In sector II, a group of rooms were in use during LM IIIC. (Kretike Estia 4, 241-244) At Stavromenos, on the Zacharake plot (near the Spinthou- rake plot where a EM pit was dug in 1985), only pottery of different periods was recovered. (Kretike Estia 3, 265) In 1990-91, on the Daphnomele plot, rescue excavations were conducted by E. Gavrilake and E. Papadopoulou. A R bath complex was found, with all the appropriate installations. Among the pottery collected, earlier material included LM IIIA kylix stems. A detailed plan is published in Kretike Estia 4, 245-247. The final use of the building appears to be 5th Ct AD. Chania. Follow-up work on the Zompanake army camp plot (Park of Peace and Friendship-AR 1993-94, 84) was com- pleted. Part of the cemetery of ancient Kydonia which extended to the E, S and W area of the modem town was investigated, resulting in further confirmation that the it was in use from M to R times. 35 tombs had been dug by 1988, mostly in the N part of the park. (ADelt 43 Chr, 545) Most of the tombs were LC to EHL. The tomb types can be summarized as follows: built cist graves (7) late 4th Ct BC; pit graves (1) late 4th Ct BC; stone lamax (1) undated; tile graves (19) late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC; child burial (1) undated; jar burials (3) 2nd Ct AD and one LG; rock-cut ChTs (2) LM and late 2nd/early 3rd Ct AD; deep burial pit (1) 2nd Ct AD. An EM pit (A) demonstrates early use of the area although the character is unknown. (ADelt 43 Chr, 548) On the Kastelli hill, trenches for a new sewage system in 1989 and 1990 necessitated a number of rescue excavations by the Ephorate, some around the Ag. Aikaterine square in conjunction with the Swedish expedition. (Kretike Estia 4, 199- 202) The Greek-Swedish team excavated a 96m trench in Kamevaro and a 50m trench in Parodos Kamevaro in 1989 and 1990 respectively. A detailed preliminary report has now appeared in English in AAA 21, 15-55, and thus only a few points are noted here. The 1989 excavations uncovered good EM III to MM IA architecture with EM II beneath; a sealing beneath a EM III wall is an important rarity. An MM IA building seems to have been destroyed by fire. Protopalatial (MM IB-II) pottery was frequent, chiefly in pits, but few architectural remains occurred due to Neopalatial construction. Remains of a street and an open area belonged to the Neopalatial period as did a wall which formed the outside wall of the building excavated some years ago on the Mathioudakis plot. The M plateia of the Ag. Aikaterine excavations was found to continue SE, where the remains of a LM I circular structure-perhaps reminiscent of the Knossos dancing circles-was found. Various walls and floors of LM III date were found, although the most important find was a fragment of a Linear B tablet from a pit (latest material LM IIIB/1) now published in Kadmos 29 (1990). Metallurgical debris came from G pits. One post-R but pre-Venetian wall is a notable rarity. The 1990 trench revealed a Linear A tablet fragment in a LM I level, important evidence for LM II-IIIA/1 occupation (called the 'Intermediate period') and three more Linear B tablets on a floor dated to LM IIIB:1 by the excavators. Much controversy has since ensued as to whether or not a known Knossian 'hand' was at work and the tablets themselves are published in Kadmos 31 (1992). The trench on Katre St. revealed an important stratigraphy from modem tomes back to LG; a gap of some two centuries is attested between LM IIIC and LG. The Splantzia (Papado- poulos plot) excavation revealed one of the most important finds in recent years, namely a lustral basin of MM III-LM IA construction date with frescoed walls and pier at the bottom of the steps. After a fire destruction, the basin had been filled in during LM IA. It lay beneath a building with a polythyron destroyed by fire in LM IB and re-used in LM IIIA. The lustral basin is now spectacularly displayed in the basement of the newly constructed building and a detailed report has now appeared in AAA 21, 56-76. On the plot for a public garage, Gr/R remains were found, including part of a 1st Ct AD public baths and an extensive settlement complex of the 2nd-3rd Cts AD, perhaps part of the R agora. Beneath these was a 4th Ct BC production installation for making small objects such as figurines and amphoras; a clay source on site was noted. (Kretike Estia 4, 207) Cemeteries. In 1990, work on the S perimeter of the Church of SS Peter &amp; Paul, revealed three LM IIIA:2-B rock-cut ChTs. The finds included good examples of the Chania LM IIIA-B workshops. (Kretike Estia 4, 207-209) In the middle of the modem town, trenches for waterworks uncovered tombs of ancient Kydonia. Eight tombs were found in the first trench (5 tile-graves-lst/2nd Ct AD, three built cist graves); ten tombs were found in the second trench (five amphora child burials- st/2nd Ct AD, one pit-grave-3rd Ct BC, two tile-graves, two not discussed). Five pit-graves are reported from Giamboudake street, with two datable to the 4th Ct BC. A tile-grave of the EHL period was found in 1989 in Zumbrak- akedon street, in the SW side of Chania town. (Kretike Estia 4, 212) Eleutherna (Mylopotamos). Kretike Estia 3, 266-273 and Kretike Estia 4, 247-263 detail the work from 1988-1991 by the Department of Archaeology of the University of Crete. It is not possible to review these seasons in any detail here and the reader is referred to the above publications. P. Themelis has concentrated his research on the R House (3rd-4th centuries BC) and ECh basilica (5th to mid-7th Cts AD) in the valley on the E side of the Acropolis. The occurrence of M figurine fragments and tripod cooking pot feet suggests to the excavator</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1994-95 that a LM shrine existed in the area. The first phase of the building complex E of the R House appears to go back to LG/A when there was a burnt destruction. Th. Kalpaxis, at the Pyrgi site on the Prine hill, has attempted to distinguish the prehistoric levels in the middle of the large square building; a break between MM II-III and LM III was identified. Traces of the G or A settlement were identified for the first time. PG and G pottery has also been noted. At the Nesi site (Eleutherna hill), the peribolos wall of the sanctuary was defined and a HL house to the N of this was investigated, producing fragments of Megarian bowls but no R finds; it seems to habe been abandoned at the time of the Roman conquest in the enarly 1st Ct BC. In 1991, a general topographic survey of the area was begun-scale 1:200. N. Stamboulides continued in 1988-1991 to work at the G/A cemetery of Orthe Petra, attempting to discover its boundaries. An R and later road leading from the acropolis was discovered to have destroyed parts of the cemetery during construction. A square funerary monument appeared to have been destroyed when the road was built, and then used as a dump in which many architectural fragments were found, as well as part of a large locally-made kouros. An area on the W was found to be empty of burials, the difference in height marked by modern terraces perhaps marking the boundary here. Small sculpted figures found in building 4A (the 'hero's') appear to have been akroteria which surmounted the roof of the building. Of other monuments and pyres discovered during this period of excavation, a pyre (LL1) in area LL, N of pyres K and 3K, produced pottery of ca 670 BC. The pyre was set on a level of pebbles beneath which was another pyre for a 30- year-old, furnished with iron sword, small dagger and knife, and perhaps a bronze spearhead; bronze and iron vessels were also found. On the NW side of the pyre an unburnt skeleton, age ca 40 and lacking neck and head, was found. The exca- vator interprets this as the sacrifice or execution of an oppo- nent of the dead warrior of the pyre. The pyre is dated to the end of the 8th Ct BC and brings to mind the execution of Trojan opponents in front of the pyre of Patroclus mentioned in the Iliad. Gaudopoula (AR 1993-94, 84). A surface survey of 1990 revealed settlement remains and much pottery from M to Turkish. (Kretike Estia 4, 231) Georgioupolis (near anc. Amphimalla). An Apollo statue found in 1988 appears to be a very good R copy (Kretike Estia 3, 251-2). Kampanos (Selinou). A R cist grave was excavated in 1989 at Kampoi. It was built of local semi-worked slab stones with large covering slabs. Grave goods included a bronze coin of 160-217 AD as well as a gold ring, some bone objects and fragments of glass vessels. (Kretike Estia 4, 229) Kantanos (Selinou). SE of the village of Anisaraki, a lst-2nd Ct AD cist grave was found in 1991 and forms a new site. (Kretike Estia 4, 230) Kastelli (Kisamou). Systematic rescue excavation takes place here each year, clarifying the R town plan. The most important plot excavated here in 1987-88 (M. Gr. Kouphake), allowed a good plan of a 3rd Ct AD building with 4th Ct AD alterations to be recovered. The destruction left much triangular brick debris over a semicircular area (3) at the NE, as well as tile debris over area 5 in the SW, where there were traces of burning. The function of the building has not been determined. (Kretike Estia 3, 252-254) The G. Stavroulake plot was excavated in 1988 in the SE area of R Kisamos and two R building phases were found: 1st Ct AD and LR. The first phase ended in destruction by earthquake. In Plateia Tzanakake, sewage construction uncovered the walls of a room with an earth and pebble floor, as well as pieces of painted wall plaster, dated to the Greco- Roman period. (Kretike Estia 3, 255) Work continued in 1991 near the Health Centre (AR 1993- 94, 84) where a 1st Ct AD industrial working area was found beneath fine mosaics. (Kretike Estia 4, 222) Construction of the new sewage system has, needless to say, uncovered a great deal in fragmentary form as it ran through the core of ancient Kisamos. Divided into three sections, the main results were as follows: Sector I: one of the main paved streets (probable width 5m) of the ancient town seems to have been uncovered, with light ruts made by wheeled traffic. Part of the main drainage system was also uncovered, dated 2nd to 3rd Ct AD. The rest of the sector, towards the E, produced simple constructions of an earlier period. Sector II: From the Kalapfatake-Kouphake plots onwards, various architectural remains were discovered (bath installa- tions and a well, of 2nd to 4th Ct AD date). More paving, similar to the street described under sector I, was found further E; this appears to belong to the courtyard of a large house. Sector III: More fragmentary bath and drainage remains were found; again, most of the pottery places them in the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD. (Kretike Estia 4, 222-225) In 1989-91 the Phrangitake plot in the centre of Kastelli yielded rooms with paved floors and walls with well-dressed blocks of medium size. The building had two phases, being finally destroyed in the 4th Ct AD. Elsewhere, walls and clay drains were found as well as a well-preserved basement in the northern part. Notable were the large number of bronze and bone arrowheads and pins, as well as bronze coins. A marble head of a statue of Aphrodite can be dated to the 2nd Ct AD. On the W side of Plateia El. Venizelos, at the E. and N. Bertios, an industrial installation with hearth and reservoir was identified in 1991; it dates to the 2nd-3rd Cts AD. The A. and E. Bestake plot was bulldozed in 1988. Subsequent investigation revealed the remains of at least seven rooms of a building complex which continues into adjacent plots. The building which must have been a rich house or villa, dates to the 3rd Ct AD with some evidence for HL use of the area. (Kretike Estia 4, 225-229) Kolene Kamara (Kisamou). On the N side of the Kolymbari- Kastelli road, a HL two-floored cist grave was found with eight crania on the upper level. The lower level comprised a floor of broken tiles and mixed bones. (Kretike Estia 3, 261) Kolumbari (Kisamou). This is the site of anc. Pergamon or Polichna where St. Alexiou had already found a LM IIIB/C krater. One area revealed a storage installation of LM IIIB/C with sunken pithoi; 30 tests in a second area revealed nothing. (Kretike Estia 4, 216-218) Melidoni (Rethymnon). The first chamber of the cave was made ready for installation of an elevator, and excavation in sector B, begun in 1987, was completed in 1988. The cave was used from MM to R. In sector B, 22 levels were dug, some of 73</page><page sequence="74">74 R. A. TOMLINSON which displayed haphazard traces of fires quite unlike the LM III pyre in the depths of the cave connected with cult. The FN layer was the thickest; no trace was found of MM, in contrast to the inner cave where this marks the beginnings of cult activity; there was a gap in sector B between LM and A; C pottery was non-existent; R sherds were found immediately below the surface level. (Kretike Estia 3, 273-275) Monasteraki (Amari). Excavations in 1989 to 1991 concen- trated on clearing the German excavations in the NW and investigating a series of storage and workshop areas, producing the 2nd cache of clay sealings (ca 500). In room C3, a stone column base was found as well as wall-painting fragments. (Kretike Estia 3, 275-6; 4, 274) Sybritos (Amari). The Greek-Italian excavations on Kephala had by 1990 opened 39 pits of the kind described in AR 1993- 94, 84. The pits contained bones, fine and coarse pottery and charcoal. Pottery belongs to LM IIIC, SM, PG and G, illustrat- ing continuous use of the area. Settlement remains of LM IIIC were also found. (Kretike Estia 3, 275; 4, 269-270) R. A. TOMLINSON British School at Athens Nopegeia (Drapanias). 1990-91 excavations at this M and post- M coastal site uncovered EM-MM I levels and MM III mixed with HL. To the S, near the cemetery of Ag. Demetrios, the 1984 excavation, which had uncovered a long store-room filled with LM IA pottery, notably conical cups, was extended in 1991. Large numbers of conical cups again came from Trench I1 as well as bones of a large animal, perhaps a bull. 127 and 128 also produced large numbers of conical cups as well as a few other vases, including finer sherds with dark-on-light decoration. Traces of burning were noted. (Kretike Estia 4, 218-221) Patsos (Amari). The rock-shelter which produced so many M figurines, indicating M cult, is also the site of the church of Agios Antonios. Investigation outside the rock-shelter revealed a deposit of bulls' horns with A pottery, above which was the HL ashy pyre mixed with bones, sherds and a silver Cor coin of the 4th Ct BC. The pyre was covered by R pottery. (Kretike Estia 4, 271) Peponia (Apokoronou). Tombs of the R and Byz periods are reported at Lakase. (Kretike Estia 4, 213) Phalasarna (Kisamou) AR 1993-94, 84. Phalasama was destroyed in 88/86 BC by Metellus during the Roman takeover. In 1988, three areas were investigated by E. Hatzidaki for the Ephorate and F. Frost for the ASCS: first, a reservoir was discovered beneath a fill pressing against the tower excavated in 1987-it may have filled ships when in the harbour; second, on the N slope of the harbour, where a second tower was expected, a parallelogram-shaped structure with 5m high isodomic masonry was uncovered; the walls belong to the series encircling the enclosed harbour; third, N of the naval harbour, on a level area considered to be part of the support harbour when the sea-level was higher, yet more of the isodomic fortification wall (1.5m high) came to light, to the surprise of the excavators. Its length appears to have been at least 30m and it must have been built below water and have some connection with harbour installations. (Kretike Estia 3, 256-261) Rodobani (Selinou). A built cist grave of ECh date was uncov- ered while a farm road was being dug. (Kretike Estia 3, 262) Sphakaki Pankalochoriou (Rethymnon). Part of an extensive ER cemetery was investigated in 1988 and 1989. Twenty-five unlooted tombs were dug into the bedrock. Two types were represented: cist graves and simple pit-graves. The dead were in the extended position on their backs, with heads facing E. Twenty-two coins place the burials between the 2nd and 4th centuries AD.
