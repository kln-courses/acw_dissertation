<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Astrological Cosmos and Rhetorical Culture of Giovanni Gioviano Pontano* by CHARLES TRINKAUS R enaissance humanism, it is generally agreed, emerged in the fourteenth century as an intellectual movement devoted to the study and imitation of ancient poetry and rhetoric. It was also dedi- cated to using literature to promulgate ethical values derived from a variety of classical schools and blended with Christian teachings in more or less convincing ways. Scholastic philosophy in its three branches of metaphysics, natural philosophy and logic was either avoided by and large by humanists or was subjected to an assortment of criticisms-especially dialectic and physics. Petrarch and Salutati are salient examples. There can thus be little ground today for con- fusing humanism and scholasticism, a tendency Paul Oskar Kristel- ler has so valiantly and persistently combatted. As a direct consequence of their constant endeavors to compare and interrelate ancient and late-medieval Christian letters and moral- ity, the humanists developed a consciousness of historical variation and change and a commitment to an historical vision of learning, cul- ture, and truth. This commitment stood in contrast to the medieval impulse to base learning and science on eternal, universal, and natural conceptions of reality and to construct Christian doctrine and theol- ogy so as to agree with systematizations of knowledge already estab- lished by human reason. Granted that certain trends in late-medieval scholasticism were moving toward greater empiricism and separa- tion of revealed and natural learning, it is obvious, nevertheless, that humanistic culture was rhetorical and historical whereas scholastic culture was metaphysical and dialectical. Inevitably the concerns of the scholastics, particularly theology and natural philosophy (as well as the more usual dialectic), came to interest the humanists. In turn, the humanists' concern for textual au- thenticity and effective expression was gradually annexed by the more traditional university disciplines. With a striking quickness, the humanists sought to transform theological study and writing to *This paper was originally delivered as theJosephine Waters Bennett Lecture at the annual meeting of The Renaissance Society of America, March 20, i984, in Chicago.

Just as urgent was the concern of the humanists for the physical cosmos. Wishing to bridge the traditional separation of the realm of the humanities from the study and understanding of the corporeal and cosmic environment of human action and culture, and, like the scholastics since the Condemnation of I277, sensitive to the danger of a blatant contradiction between the Christian religious vision and the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic systems of comprehending nature, hu- manists also began to involve themselves in these questions regard- ing physical nature.1 Initially, the involvement was negative, as in the case of Petrarch's efforts to free the studia humanitatis and religious experience from the naturalistic limits that he charged had originated with Averroes. Later it was more careful and systematic, as in the case of Salutati's Defato etfortuna and De nobilitate legum et medicinae. The medical profession, with its strong commitment to astrology, was a major target of both. Although the concrete results of their po- lemics simply established the legitimacy of the humanities, I believe that the intellectual subversiveness of their critique of scholastic natu- ral philosophy has not yet been sufficiently appreciated.2 Neither Petrarch nor Salutati rejected the geocentric elemental cosmos of Aristotle and Ptolemy, but they wished to circumscribe its role as a limitation or a determinant in regard to providential action and the freedom ofthe human will. Other humanists and Renais- sance thinkers found it easier to embrace the astrological world- view, namely Matteo Palmieri in his Citta di vita, George of Trebi- zond, Giovanni Caldiera and most emphatically Marsilio Ficino, whose complex position in De vita coelitus comparanda will not be dis- 'For the influence of the Condemnations on late medieval physics see Edward Grant, "The Condemnations of I277, God's Absolute Power, and Physical Thought in the Late Middle Ages," Viator, I0 (I979), 2I I-44; John F.

The work of Frances Yates and more espe- cially that of her Warburg colleague, D. P. Walker, have aroused in- tense interest in Ficino and Pico. Eugenio Garin's Lo zodiaco della vita, now translated into English, should arouse even more.4 If Garin is right, and if Shakespeare is read at all perceptively, then it must be admitted that the Renaissance was an age in which interest in the pos- sible influence of the cosmos on human life and the history of man- kind was even greater than our contemporary fascination with space and its possible powers and inhabitants.

Of the four professional realms that dealt with the lives of humans in the Renaissance-natural philosophy and medicine, law and politics, learning and culture, and religious worship and salvation-Pontano was an adept in all but the last. But it is important to note that al- though he was neither a medical doctor nor a lawyer, as a humanist he did play a major role in the royal administration. Moreover, we shall see that he brought his humanistic rhetorical culture to bear on the task of explaining astrology. The present paper will concentrate on Pontano's major astrologi- cal work, his De rebus coelestibus. This work, first drafted in I475-76, was completely revised after I495 in the final years of his life,6 when he composed extensive introductions for the various books. Each book was dedicated to a friend, in most cases a well-known contem- porary scholar or writer. These proems are intended to explain and justify astrology, not to set forth the details of its teachings. I shall focus on selected aspects of these explanatory statements, rather than attempt to set forth the fairly well-known scientific or pseudo- scientific content of the work. My treatment should not be consid- ered as belonging to the history of science. As I shall show from his dialogue Aegidius, Pontano was concerned to reconcile astrology with the Christian religion; he did not believe that astrology seri- ously limited free will.7 But since Pontano had already written a quite orthodox poem, De mundi creatione, ad Antonium Panhormitam, before Beccadelli died in I47I,8 Benedetto Soldati's hypothesis that his first draft of De rebus was Averroistic in Renan's sense seems un- likely. The earlier manuscripts are lost, and Soldati, writing in i906, 5See the careful short profile by Liliana Monti Sabia in Poeti latini del Quattrocento, eds.

For Pontano, astrology was the study of the influences of the supe- rior heavenly matters upon the inferior earthly ones. As we shall see more fully, knowledge of these phenomena rests on consuetudo con- firmed by observatio. Where knowledge was based on observation, measurement and numerical calculation, in the part he called astron- omy, it could be construed as a science. However, the larger part of astrology, following both the recent and the ancient tradition, tended to be conjectural. 10 Pontano claims to be following Ptolemy's Tetra- biblos or Tractatus quadripartitus and also Julius Firmicus Maternus, the Roman astrological poet. The latter was no doubt admired because Pontano was himself the author of a long astrological poem, Urania, which he first composed in the I470s, but later revised and aug- mented in the surviving versions.11 Although Pontano's outlook is fundamentally Aristotelian and physical rather than Ptolemaic and mathematical, since he cannot get astrological details from Aristotle, he must turn to Ptolemy and to medical sources such as Galen for his sections on the etiology and avoidance of disease. 12 In myjudgment, the most notable aspect of Pontano's astrological treatise is his constant use of analogies drawn from his or "our" ter- restrial experience. Consequently, if a vision of the cosmos emerges from his writings, it is a highly anthropomorphic one. For instance, beginning in his proem to Book I with a declaration from Aristotle regarding the superiority and originating power of the eternal, heav- enly beings in regard to the inferior temporal earthly ones, he sug- gests, speaking loosely, two analogies that are fundamental to his thinking. First, he likens the relation of the superior determining realm to the inferior determined one to "that between males and fe- males in the very act of the generation of mankind." Certainly the distinction between the perfect and the imperfect is evident here, for 9Soldati, La poesia astrological pp. 249-52. '0De reb. coel., Lib. II, sig. D7v. "De reb. coel., Lib. I, sig. D6.

The male is recognized in the act of generation to be more excellent and of greater authority, because he is the one who moves, so that reason is present in him, and by his motion and by reason form is conferred on the foetus being generated. Since the female passively contributes only the supply of generative matter, all authority and form reside in the male. Aristotle's metaphysics of the unity of form and matter has been combined here with this theory of sexual genera- tion. The result is a renewal of the Hesiodic vision of Uranos and Gaia generating life and the world. 13 The other analogy that Pontano introduces is also of Hellenic ori- gin. Reason and form in the mind of the shipwright who is building ships or in the mind of the potter who is modelling an amphora com- bine with matter for the production of the finished object. Aristotle's hylomorphism, as is well known, rests on this sort of analogy. What is significant is Pontano's extension of the analogy. "Therefore," he says, "what is present in the artist in creating statues, . . . and in males generating offspring, will this not be present also in the heav- ens from which most certainly the origin of the generation of things is drawn forth? If indeed the heavens move through themselves, they move all other things. For from them will flow that everlasting power of acting and procreating; from them the heat itself that is seated in animals and in the seeds, from this heat the fecundity of things and that which may pleasingly be called prolification [prolifica- tio] is derived; and from the heavens come the arousal of the spirits and the cause and origin of every emotion of animals. "14 13De reb. coel., Lib. I, sig. A2: "hac in parte uti liceat, quantum mares inter est ac foeminas in ipso hominum genere, quos natura ipsa sexu quoque suo discreverit.... Rursus eos ita simul in generatione ad procreandum conciliat, ut ex illorum concilia- tione et copula generatio passim substituatur. Qua in conciliatione et coitu mas eo ap- paret agnosciturque praestantior auctoritatisque magis perspectae, quod ei ut moventi ratio inest et cum ratione simul forma. Secus autem usuvenit in foemina, cui materie unius indita est tantum suppeditatio. Siquidem motus ipsius principium, omnisque auctoritas penes marem existit, cui ut auctori (quod dictum est) ratio inest ac forma, cuius ipse moveatur gratia." Cf. Aristotle Degen. animal., I, 2(76 Ia); I, 21, 1-20 (729b). 14De reb. coel., Lib. I, sig. A2r-v: "Quod igitur inest artifici in effigiandis statuis, in consuendis vestibus, in generanda prole maribus, an non inerit et coelo, a quo (ut cer- tum est) generationis rerum ducantur primordia?

Inde nanque defluit sempiterna illa quidem agendi ac procreandi facultas; inde calor ipse animalibus insitus ac seminibus, a quo rerum foecunditas et ea quam prolificationem appellare placet proveniunt; inde suscitatio spirituum omnisque animalis commotionis existit causa atque origo."</page><page sequence="7">452 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY It is no accident that in introducing these two metaphors, which were widely employed in classical thought as a basis for cosmology and metaphysics, Pontano was speaking as a poet. This becomes ob- vious from his subsequent comparisons. The use of analogical think- ing, which is arguably just as endemic to the rhetorical culture of the Renaissance as it had been among the ancients, suggests how astrol- ogy (that is, the notion of celestial domination over the terrestrial) could be integrated with everyday experience in this culture and made to seem natural and convincing. Pontano's analogy of sexuality and reproduction suggests also the close connection of astrology with medicine in the Renaissance. This connection leads him to a further biological analogy, one that is cen- tral to his conception of the heavens. The commanding and fostering role of the heart and the flow of the blood in the human and animal organism is used to illuminate the role of the sun in relation to the moon and the other bodies in the heavens, and through them to the earth and its creatures. As he concludes: "Thus the sun itself is as it were the inciter and source of heat so as to be the author and estab- lisher of life itself."15 Applying once again the metaphor of sexual generation, Pontano sees the action of the sun on earth as like that of the generative power of male semen on female blood in the womb. Indeed, he thinks he has put it most effectively: "if I should say that this earth sitting on the waters is the womb of the entire world in which, just as in the uterus of a woman, the discharges of generation fittingly come together. "16 Pontano was surely aware of the classical provenance of this myth regarding the sexual generation of earthly existence, for he does not fail to attribute the traditional powers of Greek and Roman deities to the planets named after them. This dual notion of form and matter and of action and passivity, which Pontano knew both from Aristotle and also from Plato's Ti- maeus, stands opposed to the Christian doctrine of creation ex nihilo, a doctrine which medieval and Renaissance thinkers could hardly ig- nore. In relating the creation of the earth and of man in his astrologi- cal poem, Urania, Pontano follows the order of Genesis I, and he 15De reb. coel., Lib. I, sig. A2v: "Sic sol ipse quidam quasi fomes ac fons est caloris, ut vitae quidem ipsi et auctor et constitutor." '6De reb. coel., Lib. I, sigs.

But Pontano abandons the Biblical sequence once man has been created subsequent to the other forms of life. Instead, he fol- lows in Urania the classical humanist myth, found in Plato's Prota- goras and Cicero's De inventione, of the founding of the arts, and the rise from them of cities and political institutions. He ends his earlier Hymn: De mundi creatione: "Quodque decet bona cuncta deo iustum- que piumque/ Ascribis, nostrae sed mala nequitiae." ("It is proper that you ascribe all goods, justice and piety to God, but evils to our own wickedness. "1)17 Later, in dealing with the composition of the body in Book IX of De rebus he reports how the organs of sense, co- ordinated and affected by the stars, lead on to reason, "and once rea- son has entered the soul, it so ennobles it that there are now, as there once were, those who dare to say that man is a creation of God. And we who are Christians persevere in thinking that this was the way it actually happened. "18 There is a certain ambiguity in these writings, for Pontano seems to argue that through the senses the sun and the planets affect even the mind and thought of man, while elsewhere in this treatise and in other writings,19 he says that astrology deals only with the corporeal and that the mind and soul are independent of stellar influences. Here he says: "In this way the sun, that is, the heat flowing from it, be- comes a certain incitement of the senses of the soul and of the mind both for thinking and for contemplating. Thus all these titillations of the senses and the spirits originate from heat, and they are subordi- nate to the soul and tpen the path to it and to those things called the properties of the intellect. Hence the senses arejustly called by Cicero the satellites of the soul. "20 17Urania, I, I063 (Soldati, Carmina, I, 33); De mundi creatione, II I-I2 (Soldati, Car- mina, II, 23 I). "8De reb. coel., Lib. IX, sig. Ps: . . quam ingressa ratio animam ipsam sic nobilitat ut hominem tandem dei ipsius opificium sint qui dicere ausi et olim fuerint, et nunc qui Christiani sumus, hoc ipsum ita vere factum esse pertendamus." "TDe reb. coel., Lib. XII, sig. V6, e.g. and in Aegidius, see below pp. 464ff. 21'De reb. coel., Lib. IV, sig.

The sun is the commander of an army of heavenly bodies, and the human senses, along with the veins and nerves, are their weap- ons. The whole lengthy passage is a dithyramb to the sun, whose golden color is the same as ripened wheat and as the most beautiful and desired metal. The sun, like an emperor, commands all the other bodies which enter into the generative process: "Indeed what usually happens in generation seems the same to me as what happens in a well-constituted republic." The one magistrate and moderator does some things partly by himself, partly he indicates to others what actions are to be undertaken, and he permits these actions to be exe- cuted by the others. While Pontano sketches out the metaphor in lengthy detail, he also seems to mean it literally. For this star vindi- cates to itself the prefectures of provinces and the magistracies of cit- ies, including both the imperial and the sacerdotal kind of honor and domination. Thus all external goods come from the sun. But also rightly, since "one's understanding is kindled from heat, the power of understanding and what was called intelligence (intelligentia) by the ancients. The goods of the soul should also be ascribed to the power and bounty of the sun. "21 Pontano's astrological system is far more complex than this pas- sage would suggest. It also takes into consideration the supposed qualities of the moon and the planets, varying in their heat and frigid- ity, their humidity and dryness. He insists, however, that the planets move on their own will and power, not by the sun's heat or magnet- ism. "Indeed, the tortoises are moved by their own will by using their four legs, the serpents by coiling, the fish by swimming and sliding, the birds by flying, and men by alternately extending a foot. The cattle do so by their four feet, and where they go they return by 21De reb. coel., Lib. IV, sig. G7r-v: "Ac mihi quidem videri illud idem in generatione solet quod in bene constituta re publica, ut magistratus unus temperatorque rei totius quaedem partim agat ipse per se, partim faciunda innuat aliisque peragenda permittat, quaedam et gerat ipse et aliorum simul in gerenda re utatur opera; alia vero nunc de- cernat ab his aut illis administranda, nunc imperet quibus sit obtemperandum, ac nunc praescribat, nunc geri ex officio cuiusque rem atque ex usu annuat; ipse tandem unus ille ac solus sit ad quem omnia referantur et cuius nutu administrentur cuncta. ...

Why should not the stars, which for this reason are called wandering, advance, recede and maintain their places by their natural and innate motion and not any force supplied by the sun, or by any external power driving them?"22 This self-movement of the planets by their own vis insita was con- ceived by Pontano as something close to human volition, rather than as the inertial movement that Newton denoted by the same term, vis insita. Accordingly, he sees an affinity between certain planets and certain zodiacal signs that is analogous to similar affinities existing in human society. "Therefore, this equidistance of parts, and both the same remoteness and the same nearness from the equinoctial points, from which the likeness of ascents and descents derives, induces an agreement among them and (as I would say) a certain consensus and familiar affection, and (as the Greeks call it) a sympathia. This also happens in civil life. ."23 There is then for Pontano a civil society in the sky. By maintaining this notion of stellar freedom, Pontano rejects the belief that there were transparent crystalline orbs that moved the planets about. These orbs move in epicycles and eccentrics, as Pto- lemy conceived it. But the invention of these paths, says Pontano, is simply a brilliant aid to understanding, and these lines and circles (like the orbs) do not actually exist in the heavens. Thus the measure- ment of any movement is saved intellectually. "Accordingly there are clocks and small astrological machines and tables that may be judged to be divine rather than human contraptions. But that we should think the stars themselves are pushed in circles and wheeled about as though in chariots is altogether absurd." If the orbs were compacted matter, as the stars are, we should be able to see them. "They are in fact not seen because they are nothing and are conceived 22De reb. coel., Lib. III, sig.

Quod in vita quoque civili contingit...."</page><page sequence="11">456 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY only in thought for the sake of teaching and understanding."24 Again a human invention is proposed as the source of a widespread astro- logical and astronomical misconception. A central feature of Pontano's astrology is his connecting celestial variation with the variations of human temperaments, physiques, psychological characteristics, and even tones of voice.25 All these var- iations in humans occur through the balance of humors with which a person is endowed at birth: the humors themselves vary in heat and coldness, humidity and dryness in accord with the positions of the planets in relation to each other and to the zodiacal signs. The signs themselves add qualities derived from their poetical, metaphorical nature: libra, the scale, for instance providing balance. Pontano is wonderfully ambiguous as to whether their names derived from their natures or their attributes were assigned according to their names.26 Regrettably there is no time for details here. In many imagi- native ways, he compares celestial and human variety and appeals to astral influences as an environmental counter to heredity. He does so in order to account for the remarkable ways in which children differ from their parents. He gives as an example, his own literary talents which were totally lacking in his parents and grandparents.27 For 24De reb. coel., Lib. III, sig. F7: "Quemadmodum in horologiis astrologicisque ma- chinulis ac tabellis usuvenit ut divina haec potius quam humana sint inventa iudicanda.

He compared it to the world of human culture, which also varied according to talents, peoples, geographic regions, and history.28 He draws a marvellous metaphor, comparing heavenly things to the variety produced by the arts and trades, especially those of painting and dyeing, in which such richly varied effects can be gained from different mixtures of the few pri- mary colors: "Such diligence can be seen in every art." He especially sees this to be the case in his own art of poetry. And in his work as a humanistic moralist, he stresses the variety of social behavior pat- terns and motivations expressed through the vices and so-called so- cial virtues.29 finitus pene filiorum potius est numerus qui diversas artis, diversa studia, diversa etiam a paternis instituta consectentur, cum saepenumero tota illis (ut dici solet) fronte sint adversi; quae res exemplorum locupletione minime indiget." And for Pontano him- self: "Nos qui haec scribimus nulla a praeceptore aut ad carmen componendum, aut ad philosophiamn ediscendam, aut ad coeli significationes intelligendas instituti sumus. Sola enim natura insitaque animi vis ac veterum scriptorum lectio assidua ad haec ipsa nos traxit, quorum et pater avuusque ignorantissimi fuere, et mater satis habuit lani- ficio ac telae intenta esse.

He then moves on to compare the emotional reactions produced by rhetoric to those responses produced in the humors and tempera- ments of human beings by the stars. "Just as from the structure of a speech laid forth in a series by speakers there is produced in the audi- tors an impulse for hilarity, sadness, severity, levity, mockery, jok- ing, tears, joy, vengeance, clemency, as well as for other affections, so from the mixtures of stars and signs and from their irradiations and diverse configurations the bodies of men are rendered into varied and different appearances and their dispositions are manifested in such diversity according to that variety reflected by the bodies them- selves. 9"930 In an interesting passage found in the unfinished thirteenth book, he dwells on the changing effects of natural substances as they are variously used, and he argues that out of the mixture of ways that humans act upon materials a "third force" arises, namely "that which is born after the mixture of these things and which in no way adhered previously in the matter. . . ." So men use things in various ways, and new forces emerge from the mixtures of stellar influences. "From this so diverse and multiple use of things, and from their so varied mixture among themselves, our life itself and the society of men is constituted." In like fashion, the arts, civil customs, the entire administration of public affairs and language itself are also derived from the mixtures of things.31 alios excellere in effigiandis senum simulacris, alios in adolescentum, hos in variandis pratis ac silvis, illos in aviculis aut feris animalibus exprimendis.

And he repeats that by the mixing of letters, and then of words, speech can produce marvellous effects in others, and it can also indicate what is taking place in the speaker himself. Pontano wishes by this account of the versatility of mankind in the discovery and employment of materials, in the invention and utilization of lan- guage, as well as in the experience of living together in an orderly but free society, to claim a familiar flexibility and set of powers for the heavens. "For if in the things which are of the heavens and the stars I may be permitted to use the example of our affairs and to compare them with inferior things, especially through this method and by this road the mixings of the heavenly configurations can be set forth for our instruction andjudgment."32 This conception of the social relations of the heavens may be com- pared with a passage from the De sermone, written closely in time to the De rebus coelestibus (I499 with revisions to I 502), where Pontano sees speech as the cement of human relations: "Just as reason, herself, is the guide and mistress for directing every action, so speech is the administrator of all those things which, conceived in the mind and activated by reasoning, are dragged forth into the public world, since, as it is said, we are born sociable and must live together. Wher- ever speech is greater and more frequent, there is a richer supply of all those things of which life is in need (since need is given to all men as a companion at their birth). Through speech life is made far more adaptable as well as more capable of acquiring virtues and attaining happiness." Pontano thus asserts a rhetorical conception of human culture which was both founded on the language arts and articulated by the variety of speaking styles. Men manifested the variety of their characters or moral habits in the verbal strategies employed in social intercourse, and these he analyzed in the De sermone and in his trea- tises on the social virtues. These habitual rhetorical and charactero- logical modes of behavior tended to be of two sorts: one wherein so- Ex hoc itaque usU rerum tam diverso ac multiplici et ear-um inter se commistione tam varia vita ipsa nostra hominumque societas constat. .." 32De reb. coel., Lib.

XIV: "Quod si in uis quae coeli et stellarum sunt, rerum nostrarum exemplis uti eaque componere cum inferioribus his licuerit, hoc maxime modo hacque etiam via coelestium se se configurationum commistiones habent et ad informandum et ad decernendum."</page><page sequence="15">460 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY cial life was furthered by prudential modes of wisdom and the virtues of humor and pleasantness, and another wherein the disruptive and self-enhancing vices brought about suffering and conflict. It is note- worthy that he regards these rhetorical modes as employed in the daily intercourse of men with each other in domestic and social life and not as something employed in the formal political and epideictic occasions of the orator.33 The question thus arises whether the humanistic vision of man uti- lizing nature and forging his own civilization, a vision that Pontano certainly avows, clashes with the celestial determinism of his astrol- ogy. There can be no doubt that he firmly believed not only that the stars exert a physical influence on man by fixing at his birth the com- bination of humors in his temperament (ingenium) but also that man's physical and emotional composition would in turn influence his moral and mental activity. But how could Pontano be sure of this? He goes into the question of the validity of astrological knowledge in two places, namely, in the proem to Book II, which is addressed to Jacopo Sannazzaro, and in Book XII, which contains a direct reply to and seeming refutation of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. Although these discussions are of great importance for comprehending the the- oretical basis of Pontano's astrology, only a partial exposition is pos- sible here. Consuetudo and observatio, as I have already mentioned, are the bases of celestial knowledge, arrived at ages ago, many times forgot- ten, then rediscovered and always the same. For Pontano, the most important activity in the rise of astrology was giving names to the various planets, stars, and constellations. "Is not the same process," 33G. G. Pontano, De sermone libri sex, ed. S. Lupi and A. Riscato (Lugano, 1954), I, i, p. 3: "Ut autem ratio ipsa dux est ac magistra ad actiones quasque dirigendas, sic oratio illorum ministra est omnium quae mente concepta ratiocinandoque agitata de- promuntur in medium, cum sociabiles, ut dictum est, nati simus sitque vivendum in multitudine; quae quo maior est ac frequentior, eo in illa huberior est copia eorum om- nium quibus vita indigeat, quando nascentibus hominibus inopia data est comes; qua e re vita ipsa longe aptior redditur atque habilior tum ad assequendas virtutes tum ad feli- citatem comparandam." Pontano considers the rhetoric of these social virtues and vices throughout the four books of De sermone. For a discussion of some of them, see my "Themes for a Renaissance Anthropology", The Scope of Renaissance Humanism, pp. 365-68. Pontano's treatises on social virtues have been edited by Francesco Tateo: Giovanni Pontano, i trattati delle virtu' sociali (Rome, 1965) and Ioannis Ioviani Pontani De maqnanimitate (Florence, I969). See also Tateo's Umanesimo etico di Giovanni Pontano (Lecce, 1972). More ample discussion of Pontano's rhetorical culture must be reserved for another occasion.</page><page sequence="16">THE ASTROLOGICAL COSMOS 461 he asks, "used by men in imposing distinguishing marks and calling individual things by their own names? The human community uses these [signs] and without them human society could in no way exist. ... Thus praises should also be bestowed on the inventors of astrol- ogy, if they made use of the same practice when they gave meaning to the most hidden significations of the signs and stars by the most fitting names possible." He points out: "Indeed, by these conferrings of names the poets bestowed much beauty on these indicators of the degrees and powers."34 There is, of course, a deep ambiguity sur- rounding these remarks. Did the meanings and effects attributed to the planets and signs reflect the names bestowed upon them, or were the names simply fitted to an assumed reality? Since a modern scien- tific rationalist would say that the powers were not real but invented and then attributed, what seems of importance here is that Pontano and his predecessors have fabricated a poetic reduplication of the earthly world in the heavenly one. Pontano's rhetorical culture has been projected into the celestial world, and, as he believed, the celes- tial world is mirrored in the human. We can go back as far as Hesiod and observe the same procedures. Pontano's sources were certainly the ancient poets and Ptolemy. Although he was Aristotelian, basic- ally he followed Aristotle only for the underlying metaphysics and physics on which he rests his system. In fact, the poetic element of this lengthy work is much more prominent than the physical and the almost nonexistent mathematical aspects of astrology.35 Moreover, his own highly developed sensitivity to the potency of words and metaphor in human thinking and acting, on which he claims human society is based, seems more prominent than the attention he pays to the physical and the mathematical. His astrological poem, Urania, carries over to and parallels his De rebus coelestibus. 34De reb. coel., Lib. II, sig. D7: "An non idem quoque ab hominibus ipsis servatum est imponendis notis, appellandisque suo nomine rebus singulis? quibus hominum coetus uteretur, ac sine quibus constare humana societas nulla ratione posset. . . . ut laudi quoque dandum sit astrologiae inventoribus, si hoc idem servarunt, dum oc- cultissimas signorum ac stellarum significationes vocibus insignivere perquam accom- modatis...." And slightly earlier on D7: "Quibus quidem nominum inditionibus, decretorum ac potestatum notis ornamenti plurimum attulere Poetae . . " 35In his few pages on Pontano, Duhem, pp. 54-56 and 8o, stresses "the numerically exact determination of the celestial movements" (p. 56) as Pontano's view of the true goal of astronomy. My own reading suggests that this is hardly true at all. Lynn Thorndike, A History of Magic and Experimental Science, IV (New York, I934), 405, 407, and 540 gives three very incidental references and does not discuss this work.</page><page sequence="17">462 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY Pontano presents a careful description of the inductive procedures that the mind follows to arrive at science; these procedures are those of astronomy. He then offers a defense of using analogical reasoning leading to conjecture, which, he grants, plays a large part in astrol- ogy, certainly in his own. "Since the mind itself relies much on anal- ogies, . . . and these likenesses are not only of qualities but also of motions and times, . . . the mind compares these likenesses with each other at the same time. And from this comparison, when from all directions it agrees on one, a general approbation and consensus is born which has in itself a marvellous power both for conjecturing and discovering. Therefore the mind, following on this general ap- proval and mutual consensus of the similitudes among themselves, represents to the soul the comparisons by which it shows the way to it, and, as though a road, leads now to those things which belong to reason itself, now to those which belong to conjecture. These conjec- tures, although they are not entirely certain and necessary, neverthe- less frequently turn out [to be true], and thus they are customarily held to be [true]." This statement is interesting because he has ex- pounded the probabilistic reasoning by analogy assigned to rhetoric by both Aristotle and Cicero, and he loses no time in assigning it to astrology as well: "Therefore all knowledge of the things of the heavens and of the stars is established partly by reason and partly by conjecture. What is established by reason is called astronomy, since it carries with it knowledge and certainty of motions, times and num- bers." Astrology, on the other hand, is partly rational, insofar as it is based on nature, but it is also partly conjectural when it makes pre- dictions concerning events which involve the possibility of men con- senting or not consenting.36 36De reb. coel., Lib. II, sig.

Illa vero quae vocata est Astrologia parte e quadam rationalis est,</page><page sequence="18">THE ASTROLOGICAL COSMOS 463 Pontano's reply to Pico's lengthy and complex critique of astrol- ogy thus involves, first of all, his defending the need for disciplines enabling man to grasp the operational regularities in the ever- changing flux of phenomena. Behind change and appearance are God and nature as their dispensers. Without disciplines, "the works and care for investigating entirely abandoned, and the intelligence of the soul, which is the divine part of us, neglected, we would transform ourselves into the life and customs of the beasts. . . ." Astrology therefore ought to be preserved among the arts and sciences.37 One of Pico's major arguments was that the heavens act as a gen- eral cause but all effects can be better explained by proximate, inferior causes. Pontano can only agree that predictions are unreliable: "Cer- tainly neither the heavens nor the stars built the ships by which car- goes are transported, nor the battleaxes by which vicious men strike down citizens, nor do they in any way tend to the wool and linen from which cloths are woven, nor do they establish penalties or pun- ishments by which convicts and criminals are punished. . . . Men themselves establish institutions for living more securely and more abundantly. And do they not also build homes and towns and for this purpose establish the decrees and laws and ceremonies and magistra- cies in order to live more equitably and less subject to accident and necessity?"38 Yet the powers of the stars remain, even though the quoniam a natura rebusque naturalibus minime recedit.

Although men cannot avert some things, such as old age, they are able to moderate the force (im- petus) of many things coming from above, or at least to soften their fury.39 In the closing years of his life, Pontano seems to have focused strongly on this underlying question of the interrelationship of the divine, the cosmic and the human powers. In his Aegidius, his last di- alogue, he not only presents an imaginary sermon of Egidio da Vi- terbo, soon to become General of the Augustinian Hermits, but he also speaks of his own wonder at the phenomena of nature, including celestial things, and of the way their actions in kinship with men are divine gifts. "Since the order of natural things is marvellous, and we are able to admire it more than to understand it by any mental power at all, I have always considered it as certain that the divine and most enormous goodness, which revealed itself in Christ with fatherly charity to the human race, opened itself to mortals in many different ways. And because these inferior beings, and those which are called 'natural' by the heavenly physicists, are mingled in due proportion by these movements, there is indeed no little kinship between men and them. Through this kinship that Creator, moderator and ruler of all things, namely God, signifies and foretells many things, especially to good men, but even sometimes to wicked men for the sake of re- moving their faults."40 tem publice ac privatim initio sibi constituere et pro tempore etiam constituunt.

God also speaks to men in dreams through assumed voices or mouths (ora); these are called "or- acles." Pontano relates that he himself had frequently been warned in dreams of dangers of which he had not known.41 But the celestial powers, though used by God, are not the same as God: "I pray you, o best of men, when the morning sun rises, does not light itself, scattered at this point of time, immediately illumine the entire heav- ens with its irradiations? But this light comes from the sun, and the sun itself is corporeal, because the eyes themselves feel it. Can there- fore the light flowing from the sun in its own incomprehensible transparency and with that swiftness illuminate at the very same in- stant of time such a great vastness of air, sea, and land, and yet those ministers of divine majesty [i.e. the angels] cannot at that same mo- ment fly out to us from the highest ether, and these incorporeal be- ings not be cast forth as light is cast from the body of the sun?"42 By such an oblique rhetoric Pontano announces his simultaneous adher- ence to the reality of divine miraculous actions and to the natural actions and influences of the stars and planets. According to Pontano, God finds the celestial forces compatible with his own power and he sometimes works through them. Pontano explicitly declares in the Aegidius that human free will can function either with or against the power of the stars. In a long speech written for Giovanni Pardo, Pontano says: "We come now to aethereis ab illis commotionibus temperentur, non exiguam quidem homini cum illis esse cognationem; quam per ipsam fabricator ille omnium moderatorque ac rector Deus multa, bonis praesertim viris nec raro etiam perversis, emendandorum ipsorum gratia et significet et portendat...." 4"Aegidius, p. 257: (passage in n. 40 continues) "praecipue autem humanis quiescen- tibus curis atque inter dormiendum; ut aliquando dii ipsi nobiscum perinde ac humano assumpto ore loqui videantur unde oracula sunt a prudentibus quibusdam dicta. Neve autem in enumeratione oraculorum ipsorum antiquitatisque testimoniis vos occupem referendis, de me ut loquar, ego ipse ita saepe dormiens commonefactus sum, ut quae pericula nec ante timuissem neque prius agitassem animo, vigilans postea, tutus liber- que commonefactione ex ea facile praeterierim." 42Aegidius, p. 258: "Obsecro vos, viri optimi, mane oriente sole nonne statim lux ipsa puncto temporis dispersa coelum hoc universum irradiatione sua illuminat? Atqui lux a sole existit, sol vero ipse corporeus est, quod oculi ipsi sentiunt; potest igitur a sole profluens lux tenuitate sua incomprehensibilique illa celeritate eodem simul puncto tantam aeris, maris, terrae vastitatem illustrare, nec tamen poterunt eodem ipso momento ministri illi maiestatis vel supremo ex aethere ad nos evolare, incorporei ipsi neque ut solaris lux e corpore iaculati?"</page><page sequence="21">466 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY the wills of men: if they permit themselves to be dominated by the senses, nothing is more fleeting and feeble, and I also add exhausted and tamable; if the contrary, there is nothing more noble, strong, commanding than these, when we judge for nothing the senses themselves and their blandishments, and put them under the yoke. "43 Then, presenting several notorious examples of those who gave in to their lusts, and of one man, "our Gioviano", who resisted the temptation to become rich by working for the French, Pardo of- fers an analysis of the relationship of the will to reason. "To begin: all praise and blame is applied to voluntary actions and exists in accord- ance with them." Man, guided by nature, is moved to desire those things which carry some image of good before them. The mind is aroused by the titillations of the senses that show these things to it. But until the will is aroused the mind will not confide in those things by which it attains its goal. "The will begins to move forward as something free and subject to its own law." It then takes the counsel of reason, restrains itself, and, having accepted reason, guides itself within prescribed limits and chooses what should be chosen for its own capacities. It has no trouble combatting the senses at this point: "Does not that will seem free to you which descends into battle with the senses and emerges the complete victor, rather than if it allows itself to be captivated by their insidious blandishments?"44 The will for Pontano, as for other rhetorically oriented thinkers, was central to his notion of human activity. The latter was to be called forth and praised or blamed by the orator, but it was also sub- 43Aegidius, p. 275: "Veniamus nunc ad hominum voluntates, quibus, si sese ipsae sensibus dominandas permiserint, nihil est fluxius, imbellius, addam etiam infractius, domabiliusque, contra nihil quod sit illis generosius, robustius imperiosiusque, ubi sensus ipsos eorumque illectamenta nihili fecerimus miserimusque sub iugum." 44Aegidius, pp. 277-78: "Principio laus omnis vituperatioque voluntariis versatur in actionibus existitque ab illis. Cum enim natura duce moveamur ad ea cupienda quae boni alicuius speciem prae se ferant eaque sensibus repraesententur, de quorum titilla- tione animus sese excitat, non prius tamen ad ea peragenda, quibus assecuturum sese illa confidat, animus ipse expergiscitur quam voluntas quoque suscitetur; quae initio quidem ut libera ac sui iuris latius evagatur, post vero, adhibita secum in consilio rati- one ac frenum sibi ipsa imponens, eo accepto, sese ipsam moderatur redigitque intra praescriptum; mox deliberando eligit quae pro facultate ac viribus suis eligenda videan- tur....

This involves what I have called Pon- tano's "rhetorical culture". Pardo continues: "If, then, the will pro- ceeds with reason, certainly these actions ought to be praised. On the contrary, they will be censured where the will, in choosing and mov- ing, deviates from the path of reason and, softened by the delights of the senses, follows desire, sticks to its vestiges, and obeys its com- mand." In a thought developed from Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, Pontano relates the freedom of the will to the decision-making pro- cess of deliberation: "Moreover, not only things themselves and actions, but also the name itself of 'deliberating,' give evidence that the will is free (libera). This is so because the will is free in arriving at thejudgment as to whether it wishes to undertake and pursue some- thing or, on the contrary, to desist and allow itself to follow the ad- vice of the senses. "45 Pontano easily reconciled his strong conviction regarding the will's freedom and power with his position on astrology which stressed that the strength of the temperament of the humors affected both the character and the behavior of each person. The will was part of the mind, but a person's natural disposition (ingenium) had its basis in the body. However, Pontano does make a number of statements in the course of De rebus coelestibus which suggest that the stellar powers can operate through one's natural disposition and thereby ex- tend its influence to mental activities. The fact that the word he nor- mally uses for temperament is ingenium, which is frequently trans- lated (though not always correctly) as "mind", suggests that there is at least some ambiguity. But in his statement on this topic in Aegi- dius, voiced through the persona of Pardo, he is completely forth- right. "Finally," Pardo says, "it seems that the following should be con- sidered: although the senses are themselves corporeal and each of the senses uses corporeal instruments, such as the ears for hearing, the 45Aegidius, p. 278: ". . . si cum ratione progredietur, nimirum ipsae laudabuntur; contra vituperabuntur ubi et in eligendo et in progrediendo de rationis deerrans via sensusque deliciis emollita cupiditatem sequetur ducejn illiusque inhaerebit vestigiis parueritquc imperio. Non solum autem res ipsae actionesque voluntatem liberam esse testantur, verum etiam nomen ipsum deliberandi, quod videlicet liberum eius sit in de- cernendo iudicium, velitne suscipere et prosequi, an contra desistere ac sensuum ip- sorum monita labi sinere."</page><page sequence="23">468 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY eyes for seeing, the nostrils for smelling, the palate and tongue for tasting, and either hands or another part of the body for touching, yet the will uses no part of the body and nothing corporeal when it either deliberates or chooses and decides. Certainly then that power and faculty belongs only to the mind, and, among all animals, to man alone. For this reason it happens that in the case of the other animals there is an impetus or an instinct only. The will, however, is proper and peculiar to man. Therefore, if the influences of the stars are di- rected only on those inferior bodies and things which are composed of the elements, and the elements themselves are a kind of field in which the stars exercise their powers, in what way are human wills subjected to the activities of those stars whose jurisdiction is limited to the elements and elementary things? But in fact the mind itself is both incorporeal and entirely free of any elementary quality or condi- tion, and its own will is indeed a very strong power which either honors by commendation the actions for which man is born or damns them by opprobrium and contempt. . . Nevertheless, the celestial configurations can be an impediment to these actions and can oppose themselves to the mind itself when it needs corporeal and external aids and favors. But where actions belong solely to the mind, one then disputes in vain concerning the actions and powers of the stars, since, as I have said, the mind itself is free and chooses and decides by its own decision.

As he, indeed, confessed, the mind is not entirely unaffected by the body, and to attempt to reconcile astrological determinism with human freedom of will by confining the latter to the purely mental realm might well be to restrict it drastically. There is an ambiguity here which he does not seem to have resolved. There is no doubt that Pontano was fervently persuaded both of the power of nature to shape the human temperament and of the power of man to direct his own affairs effectively and these simultaneously. What is missing in the discussion we have presented are two other aspects of the prob- lem of the relationship of God, nature and culture, namely: the rela- tionship of grace to free will in man's salvation, and man's combat with fortune. Since Pontano reckons the natural world as an instru- ment of the divine, which can also at God's wish be transcended, one might guess that he would leave man's salvation in God's hands. But it would perhaps be better to leave such speculations with Giuseppe Toffanin.47 Pontano makes his piety clear enough in innumerable asides in De rebus coelestibus, and he certainly affirms the power of grace in the sermon he composed in the name of Egidio da Viterbo in his dialogue, the Aegidius.48 As far as fortune is concerned, his com- ments in De rebus coelestibus seem to minimize it by granting far more influence to the celestial shaping of the humors at birth. But this is a complex question, one which Francesco Tateo has done much to un- tangle, though he still stresses how fearful and independent a power fortune seemed to Pontano.49 Pontano was not the only humanist or Renaissance thinker to compose a treatise on astrology, but he was the only one to relate his astrological theories to the problems and circumstances of human life with which as a humanist he was concerned. Certainly aware that among his predecessors Petrarch and Salutati had condemned the practice of astrology because of its apparent contradiction of divine providence and human freedom of the will, Pontano was careful to set forth, both in asides in De rebus coelestibus and head on in the Aegi- dius, his conceptions of how the two contradictions could be re- solved. Moreover, he sought to make astrology more comprehensi- 47See Toffanin, Fra Puomo e la natura, pp. i02-05. 48Aegidius, pp. 249-52. 49See Tateo, Astrologia e moralitd, pp. 12 I-67.</page><page sequence="25">470 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY ble and acceptable to a humanistic reader, though not going so far as to claim it as a studium humanitatis. He attempted this by setting forth a series of analogies that tended to humanize the celestial world and its influences over human existence. The underlying analogy, which built on the endemic acceptance of the dominance of the masculine over the feminine and on the corollary conception of maleness as ac- tive and creative and femaleness as passive and receptive, was the similarity of celestial shaping of earthly affairs to the act of sexual generation. Closely related to this was the analogy of the sun in rela- tion to the other planets and in a dominating way toward the inferior earthly things as like that of the physiological dominance of the heart by the flow of blood from it over the other organs in man and other animals. Pontano's thinking reveals not only how closely inter- twined were gender-based social attitudes and physiological concep- tions, but also how closely the metaphysical and physical concep- tions transmitted from classical thought mirrored the structures of its social and biological notions. Fittingly a third major analogy was that between the hierarchical organization of the human polity he knew and the role of the sun as the king of the planets. Clearly these com- parisons were traditional and Pontano was following a well-trodden path. Pontano's political vision, however, as revealed in these compari- sons modified a strict monarchical notion with an emphasis on the contributions of subordinate advisory and executive officials to the functioning of the commonwealth as a whole. This corresponds to his own role as a royal secretary, envoy and confidential adviser on high matters of state which he carried on as a humanist in the tradi- tion of the Aragonese court. His humanist political and social vision, which modifies the hierarchical centrality with a sense both of the value of the expert and the need for mutuality in human relations, may be seen in his characterization of the celestial world as a great harmonious society in the heavens, and in his insistence that individ- ual astral bodies were not driven but moved of their own accord. If these characterizations had been strictly applied to his astrology, there would have been a substantial modification of the usual con- ception of the eternal, unchanging regularity, and the fatal necessity, of the movements of the stars and planets. However carefully he sought to protect the physical and mathematical laws from these vi- sions, the latter must certainly be accounted an effort to humanize the seeming vast impersonality and determinance of the heavens.</page><page sequence="26">THE ASTROLOGICAL COSMOS 471 This motive is also to be seen in his comparison of the changes and fluctuations of the heavenly influences, including those of even very minor alterations and movements of the bodies, to the shifts of meaning as single letters are altered in Latin nouns. It is to be seen still more in his comparison of the combined operations of the heavens, and the rapidly shifting effects on the human temperaments they generated, to the subtly nuanced rhetorical influences on human moods and purposes brought about by shifts in style, mode and or- ganization of language in the practice of a skilled humanist writer or orator. Finally we may refer to his efforts to justify astrology as a valid discipline, in answer to Pico's criticisms and also generally and fre- quently. As a discipline it was systematic and carried on a very an- cient tradition that to Pontano must have a valid basis even though much of it had always been conjectural. This conjectural nature of astrology, which he admits can lessen the certainty of the astrologer's predictions, seems nevertheless worthy of defending, for it coincides with so many poetic insights derived from the ancient characteriza- tions of the Hellenic and Roman (and Chaldean) deities after whom the planets and constellations had been named. In some ways also the celestial system is made to seem an instrument of the Christian God, though Pontano allows for providential actions that occur outside the astral realm or directly nullify it. He seems to welcome the loose- ness of a system based on conjecture both because it permits divine circumvention and even more makes clear the wide range of possibil- ity of human voluntary actions in despite of the astral influences. Rather ambiguously, on the other hand, Pontano concedes the ri- gidities in human behavior that spring from the acquisition of habit- ual patterns of reaction generally conceived as the virtues and vices. These patterns and their many dependent modes he had analyzed in shrewd and appreciative subtlety. But were these habitual rigidities induced by the inborn dispositions of individuals which were derived from the stellar influences on the balance of humors at conception and birth? Or were they acquired developmentally in the compli- cated give and take of the growth of a young human being in family and society? The stars, Pontano thinks, can give a certain liberty from an individual's biological and environmental heredity. But is the underlying ambiguity in his thought any greater than our own concerning the influences of nature and nurture, should not we ask? But man, he sees, operates also on nature, as well as being operated</page><page sequence="27">472 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY on, and can, by mixing and utilizing for varying purposes various natural materials, bring out from them unsuspected new natures and powers. By his attempted marriage of humanism and astrology Pon- tano did not solve these important problems which have troubled both his contemporaries and ourselves. Nevertheless, he has left a re- markably insightful record of his effort as a humanist to enter the realm of natural philosophy. "Nostro Gioviano" was a rich and resourceful thinker who turned his exceptional literary energies not only to his marvellous poetry but also to confronting the realities of the divine, celestial and human worlds as they were broadly conceptualized by the men of his time and culture. He did not reconcile all of the competing elements in this world view nor leave entirely consistent statements concerning them; indeed he saw conflict and incongruities as an inescapable part of the realities he knew. But he gave his contemporaries and the gen- erations of the sixteenth century who read his works not only the beauty of their expression but powerful insights and sharply vivid observations of the motivations and modes of action of the men of that time. His astrology, combined with his sensitive reading of the problems of life of his own day into the Aristotle he knew, gave his outlook both an organic, biological, medical and a social, moral, po- litical vision. Pontano's astrology was not the eccentric cherishing of cosmological obscurities that our modern world finds difficult to be- lieve or tolerate in a humanist of the Renaissance, but it was a win- dow into the life and mind of that age.
