This in turn points to yet another and more serious deficiency. All along Anstey assumes that the people of the Congo formed an undifferentiated and largely homogeneous cultural complex, and therefore that their reactions to the assault of Belgian rule upon their tradi- tional institutions and belief systems were everywhere alike. Thus the problems raised by the different patterns of challenge and response brought to light during the terminal stage of Belgian colonialism receive only the scantiest attention, and the variables that have con- ditioned this unique situation are largely neglected. In brief, the really significant question- in what ways has Leopold's legacy affected the attitude and behaviour of the Congolese people ?-remains unanswered. Towards the end of the book Professor Anstey admits that 'for a historian a major difficulty was the necessity of consulting work in other disciplines and his unfamiliarity with these fields. It is probably in what he has failed to consult in disci- plines other than his own that he has been most deficient.' On this point at least this re- viewer finds himself in total agreement with the author. RENE LEMARCHAND A Bibliography of African Art. Compiled by L. J. P. GASKIN.

THE Bibliography of African Art, compiled at the International African Institute by L. J. P. Gaskin under the direction of Guy Atkins of the School of Oriental and African Studies, provides a useful beginning in this field and students of Negro art will be grateful to the International African Institute and to the Ford Foundation for making its production pos- sible. It is, however, selective rather than comprehensive and it suffers from the two besetting sins of modern African bibliographies, haste and the apparent inability to check references. The author has been unable to work steadily through the J.R.A.I., the Nigerian Field and the host of other serial publications and local journals that occasionally publish articles and notes on African art, nor has he found time to check all the sources given in other references. As a consequence the work is full of errors and omissions, some of them amusing but some also serious. If we consider, for example, the section under the heading 'Nigeria' and take the magazine called Nigeria we find that some of the articles contributed to it by K. C. Murray are listed while others, including an important one on the techniques of carving an Ibibio mask, are omitted. It is the same with the journal called the Nigerian Field. I published at least five articles in it on Nigerian art; one of them is listed, the rest are not, and they include one which describes the Igbo bronzes. This would not matter very much were it not that the compiler has also omitted any reference to the only other article on these bronzes (by Field in Man). On the other hand, he lists in this Nigerian section Desplagne's Le Plateau central nigerien, presumably under the impression that it refers to the plateau region of Nigeria. Had REVIEWS OF BOOKS 1o7</page><page sequence="2">io8 REVIEWS OF BOOKS he been able to refer to the book he would have discovered from its sub-title that it is con- cerned with a mission to the French Sudan which included part of the Haute Volta colony. Again, some books by P. A. Talbot are listed, others as important are not, and the latter include Peoples of Southern Nigeria, Life in Southern Nigeria and Nigerian Fertility Cults. By way of compensation another work which is not by him, Women's Mysteries, is included under his name. Messrs. Sotheby's catalogue of the Helena Rubinstein collection of African and Oceanic art is a worthy record of a magnificent collection of Negro African sculpture, now alas dis- persed. The items from non-African areas are negligible in comparison (two Solomon Islands canoe prows, three heads of Marquesas Island clubs, a Maori head and a house post, three Indonesian and three Melanesian figures, a Tlingit mask, and an Easter Island figure). The catalogue's main function is to supply the kind of information considered important by those who compete in the antique and the modern art world. The heading 'Provenance ' refers not to the place of origin of an item but to the person who first put it on the market! ' Literature ' refers not to its ethnographic background but to any exhibitions or illustrated publications in which it was displayed. Before they can rank as truly great, these 'Kula valuables ' of the Western world must, like their Melanesian prototypes, have been seen, have been talked about, and have changed hands; and, like the ' coppers ' of the north-west coast, whenever they change hands their value increases Ioo per cent. or more. Such details will of course be invaluable to the art historian, the only data missing in this respect being the dates when the item was collected and the prices paid for it on each transfer of ownership. To those primarily interested in looking at rather than collecting West African art the main importance of this catalogue lies in the 26I plates which provide a permanent record of this important collection. William Fagg's Tribes and Forms in African Art has appeared very opportunely for the 'Literature' section of the Rubinstein catalogue, which refers to it and to his previous popular works (Nigerian Images, The Sculpture of Africa) constantly, sometimes correctly, sometimes not quite so accurately. On page 70 of the catalogue we read 'the author [W. Fagg] writes that he considers that this example is one of about twelve really old examples in existence '. Mr. Fagg actually wrote: ' This is one of the undoubtedly authentic specimens numbering well under a dozen and probably all collected by 1 935.' But time, when it refers to Kula valuables, tends to become ' structural' rather than historic. The idea behind Tribes and Forms in African Art is the same as that which inspired the exhibition 'Africa: Ioo tribes, Ioo masterpieces ', which Mr. Fagg arranged for the Con- gress of Cultural Freedom in Berlin in I964. In it each tribe was represented by 'a single characteristic sculpture '. The number of tribes and of masterpieces has now been increased to 122. But if Mr. Fagg is going to use this tribal approach and claim that ' every tribe is from the point of view of art, a universe in itself' (p. 11) he should at least decide what he means by ' tribe '. Some of his 122 consist of millions of people, others of a few hundred, and in some cases of a single village, while others again (e.g. No. 45, Nok) refer not to people at all but to archaeological cultures named after the area in which they were un- earthed, or are a purely hypothetic reconstruction (e.g. No. 36, Lower Niger). There is no consistency: Jebba is a Nupe village which becomes a tribe and a style (No. 37) by virtue of the two bronze figures of unknown origin which were found, one at Jebba the other at Tada village; Mokwa is another village from which Frobenius collected a number of masks in 191 . One of these is reproduced as a masterpiece of the Nupe tribe (No. 38) and we are told in the notes that because the Nupe were 'finally converted to Islam by force of arms about 1830 the tribal religion survives only in isolated elements here and there ', the implica- tion being that Mokwa was one of these. This is not the picture presented by Nadel in his account of Nupe religion and had Mr. Fagg done a little ethnographic homework, he would</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 109 have read that Nupe religion in contrast to Yoruba religion does not represent its ideas in anthropomorphic form and that the two exceptions to this are the bronze figures on Jebba island and the masks used in a dance at Mokwa called elo (a meaningless word in Nupe) which is ' quite unlike any Nupe dance or ritual '. Nadel claims that these masks, of which he provides an illustration similar to the one collected by Frobenius, are reminiscent rather of the Yoruba or of the Ibo and other tribes of Southern Nigera. (Nupe Religion, p. 214 and plate 28). The price of Tribes and Forms (?6. 6s.) places this book out of the range of most students of African art and its size and shape make it more suitable for display on side tables than for fitting into a normal bookshelf. Westafrikanische Plastik I, forms part of a series published by the Museum fur Volker- kunde, Berlin, and this volume is the second on West African sculpture. Like the first, which covered masks (and which was reviewed in Africa, xxxi. 2, 196 ), it consists of an illustrated catalogue which, in this case, covers the museum's collection of West African statuettes and carvings; 330 are described and 272 of these are illustrated in page or half-page plates. The notes give the following details for each of them: the tribe and country of origin, the museum number, the collector and the date of collection, the size, any remarks recorded in the index, a brief general description of the piece, and references to any publications which may refer to it. This is an admirable and valuable production which other museums could do well to follow. It should form part of the library of any institution or person concerned with the study of African art. Artfrom the Guinea Coast is a well illustrated catalogue of a very successful exhibition of West African sculpture arranged in i 965 by the Pitt-Rivers Museum, Oxford. It gives some indication of the wealth of African sculpture hidden away in this museum, but not enough, for the exhibition was of necessity a small one, and some of the more striking exhibits were on loan from elsewhere. One could also have wished that the brief notes on each item could have been expanded to include the same details as those provided in the Berlin Museum's catalogue. Kalabari Sculpture really requires a review to itself. It is a study made by a social anthro- pologist whose special interest lies in West African religions and philosophies and who has been able to make a detailed study of Kalabari religion and of Ijo art. The result is the most stimulating study of a ' tribal art' that has yet appeared. It gives a concise and yet detailed summary of Ijo religion and of the Kalabari ' way of life ' and of the part played by sculpture in Kalabari society. This is followed by an analysis of the meaning and forms of Kalabari art and of the association of particular motives with the different cults and institutions. Some are universal, some are exclusive to ancestral spirits, others to non-ancestral, that is Oru (' heroes ') and Owu (water spirits), others to water spirits alone. There are three appendixes one on materials and tools, the second on Kalabari and neighbouring art styles, the third on Kalabari sculpture and social change, and all this is compressed into 46 pages of text. There are 72 plates, 5 5 of Kalabari, i6 of other Ijo peoples which support his suggestion that we can distinguish two Ijo styles, a Western and an Eastern (Kalabari). The author's conclusions will shatter many of the fond illusions held by those who postulate a Pan-African cultural unity in the field of art and aesthetics, as he shows that Kalabari ideas and practices in this field differ completely from those of the Yoruba and Bini or for that matter of other Southern Nigerian peoples. This is again an essential volume for any library concerned with West African art. G. I. JONES Federation in East Africa: Opportunities and Problems. Ed. by C. LEYS and P. ROBSON.
