Being composed for this occasion and purpose, the poem exhibits the conventional form of a praise-poem for a victor in the games. But it is shot through with a pervasive erotic colour and, in particular, it dwells upon a marriage, and upon the purpose of marriage, which is the procreation of children.2 So insistent is the recurrence of this theme in the structure of the ode that it becomes desirable to conjecture, if one assumes that literary forms and structures have their origins in people and in society, that Telesicrates himself is, not only young, but also eligible to marry, if not promised in marriage. On that hypothesis, as least, it is possible to understand the relevance of love and marriage to the victor's praise. The chief myth of the poem tells of the marriage, by abduction, of Apollo to Cyrene and the birth of their child, Aristaeus, the Libyan divinity of herdsmen and farmers. The most memorable incident of the narrative is the advice that the young god seeks and receives from his wise tutor, the Centaur Cheiron, concerning his love for Cyrene. Cheiron's attitude, shown by his gentle and benign smile, as was recognised by Basil Gildersleeve,3 is that of the sage and kindly teacher, I I am grateful for suggestions and discussions concerning the interpretation of this poem to Anne Carson Giacomelli, who will, I hope, soon publish her own views on this general topic. 2 The Athenian formula of betrothal, as used by Menander, Perikeiromene 1013-14, was TaVTflV yVf7OLWV / 7raL'wv e7rT aporT CO L 818,up: see other forms in A.

Demosthenes states plainly (59.122) that "we have wives for the sake of begetting children" and defines cohabitation as a begetting of children, the registration of sons, and the bestowal of daughters.

I wish now to point to a nearer parallel, in the latter part of the present ode. In a passage (96-100) that has been shown to be part of the poem's victory-catalogue,6 the poet speaks of the maidens who, having been spectators of Telesicrates' victories at the local games of Pallas,7 prayed, I H.

Peron, "Pindare et la victoire de Telesicrate dans la IXe Pythique (v. 76-96)," RPh ser. 3, 50 (1976) 58-78. The Scholiast (2.236 Drachmann) takes the reference in 98 to be to the Panathenaea at Athens, and he is followed by L. R. Farnell, The Works of Pindar: Critical Commentary (London 1932) 210-11, who asserts that "by the words at the outset of his sentence, cip'ats TEAETraLs flaXA6osv, he would be taken by every Greek who heard him to refer to the Panathenaea of Athens, which was the most famous international athletic contest after the four great ones." But it is not at all clear that Athens is the place in question: Nem. 10.34 (Ev TEXETaZS' &amp;LTs 'AOavawv) differs precisely in making the place-name explicit, so that it cannot be adduced as a supporting parallel for this interpretation of a passage that lacks such a specification. Furthermore, if (as Farnell agrees) the Panathenaea came next in order of status after the four great games, it is odd that Telesicrates' victory there should come so late in Pindar's victory-list, following, not only the Pythian victory, but also other triumphs at Thebes, Aegina, and Megara, and in company with the local glories at the very end. Finally, though I find no sufficient reason to argue (as some have done) that women at Cyrene had, while women at Athens had not, opportunities to observe the results of the games, the mention of the women's admiration has more point, if it is a reference made at a local celebration to a known local event and, above all, if (as will be argued) the wedding of Telesicrates to a Cyrenean girl is a subject of public attention. So, in general rightly, Schroeder 87 and Burton 56-57 (above, note 6). Herodotus (4.180.2) knows of an indigenous Libyan goddess, called "Athena" by the Greeks; cf. also 4.189.</page><page sequence="3">Cyrene and the TeAevEa of Marriage in Pindar's Ninth Pythian Ode 247 each to herself voicelessly, that she might have such a son or a husband.8 The girls, in the well-brought-up Greek way, see their fulfilment in marriage and the bearing of an outstanding son.9 But in their case at Cyrene, as in the case of the young Apollo on the Thessalian hillside, a virginal aidos prevents them from giving expression to what they feel most urgently. The inhibition here affects the girls very much in the way that in the myth it affected the male god, and the parallel shows that the theme is the aidos of eros generally, and not a masculine characteristic alone. The interpretation offers also a confirmation of the reading suggested for the passage from the myth, and the correspondence thus revealed between myth and actuality equally gives support to the conjecture, made earlier, of a connection between theme and occasion. If the girls among the spectators appear in a female role that is the counterpart, as it were the mirror-image, of the male role played by Apollo in the myth, it is possible to recognise in the pattern the poet's praise of the victor's demeanour and attractiveness, as lover and as beloved. An additional confirmation of the theme of aidos in eros in Cheiron's speech is found in the description (9-13) of the reception by Aphrodite in Libya of the god and his abducted bride: ve8TEKTO 8 pyVporE' ' A4poUa 10 Aa'XLOV beLVoV CO8E/a'Tc.JV ?xeZZ' ioawrToP'va XEpL Kov#,a- KaL Cr4LV E7FL X yAvKEpa-L evvaLT epaTav Pa3XEv alMo, eVVoVa a Ap,uOLTra OEW, TE ya'OV MELXE'VTa KoVp,a 0' Y*/EoT EVpv/Laa There can be no doubt that it is a marriage that is depicted, for Pindar speaks explicitly (66) of "the sweet consummation of gamos" in this connection, and at the close of the ode, in the matching myths of Danaus and of Antaeus, the one from the traditional store of old Greece, the other from the colonists' Hellenisation of indigenous lore, he speaks, first 8 The Scholiast (2.236 Drachmann) wished to understand ai be yvvaLKes before vLOv in 100, as if on the grounds that the prayer would be appropriate only to married women. But the implied ellipsis is harsh and the poem assumes, as will appear, that a girl finds her fulfilment in bearing a son. Gildersleeve (above, note 3) 346 and Wilamowitz (above, note 6) 266 accepted the Scholiast's view and the latest translator into English follows them: F. J. Nisetich, Pindar's Victory Songs (Baltimore and London 1980) 211, renders as follows: "girls who wished, in silence, that you were their husband; and women, Telesicrates, who prayed that you might be their son." 9 Alc. fr. 42 L-P, Voigt contrasts the destructiveness caused by Helen with the happiness of Thetis, and D. A. Campbell, Greek Lyric Poetry: A Selection (London 1967) 292, raises the question in what her happiness consists. On the view presented here, the answer to that question is given by the poet himself in lines 13-14 (7ra^xha yEvvaT' alBu8Ewav [4EpLOTov] / 6A/LOv e6v8av EAaT?7[pa 7rC0'Awv]).

So too, the truth that Apollo recognised in himself but his aidos prevented him from declaring, so that the wise Centaur had to find for it a kindly expression, was just that the god was to become husband (19o0'01, 51) to Cyrene and to beget on her a marvellous and immortal child. And here again the girls watching the local victories mentioned in the catalogue give corroboration, for they wish to have just such a husband or son, thereby making evident that it is marriage that they have in mind (97-100). To return then to Aphrodite earlier in the poem, we may note that her light touch on the chariot in which the god conveyed the nymph has the effect of shedding upon the sweetness of their embraces the loveliness of aidos (Epara'v ... aZ , 9-12). This manifestation, to be sure, cannot be just the sexual shyness of Apollo, or of the virginal spectators of the games, or of the princess Nausicaa, for that aidos is cast aside in the consummation of marriage. What the poet wishes here to represent is then the adaptation of aidos to marriage, whereby it perishes as a barrier between the husband and wife individually" to be recreated as a protection for both against external interference and a safeguard of privacy and intimacy within.'2 In this transformation aidos deserves the epithet, sparos, "lovely," which it here unusually receives,'3 for it is only eros, the former antagonist of aidos, "' Evidences of Hellenisation, apart from the myth of Antaeus, are easily recognisable. At 64 Aristaeus is identified with Zeus and Apollo, at 98 ff. we appear to hear of local festivals for Athena and the Olympians, while at 106 the local chieftain of the myth has the name of Heracles' antagonist, and at 125 the Nomads are said to have a tradition of athletic competition. Most interesting, perhaps, in this connection is the myth of Cyrene, which is Thessalian in origin, so that the nymph must be transported physically to the African shore to become mistress in a new land (7). But, en revanche, her lions, which may be thought to have been Libyan to begin with (cf., e.g., Callim. Hymns 2.91-92), are imagined to range with her over the Thessalian hillsides. Cf. Hdt. 1.8.3, a'a 8E KtLOVt EKK8VOMEVW 0VEK83vEraL KaL rTV aibC, and Diog. Laert. 8.43. Contrast, however, Plut. Conj. Praec. 46:144e. 12 The idea is imagined in the Homeric description (I. 14.330 ff.) of the LEP0s ya4oS of Zeus and Hera. She suggests that they go inside, to her secluded chamber, and he prefers the screen of a golden cloud. Similar is the convention of a cloak, in which the lovers are enveloped, as apparently in the new Cologne fragment of Archilochus (29-30), the story told concerning Sophocles by Hieron. Rhod. (fr. 35 Wehrli, Sch. d Arist.) ap. Athen. 604d, Soph.

The old, balanced tension in which eros traditionally kept the two, lover and beloved, is thought to be resolved in a new moral and social relation, by which they are joined to one another as persons, while being set apart from the society by which they are surrounded.' The aidos of the maidens who were spectators of the games sealed their lips against any expression of their deepest desires, but of the presence of the married women on the same occasion we hear not a word, presumably because their aidos bound them to their husbands, and so kept them away from the games altogether or else prevented the formation of even wordless thoughts and wishes.'5 With this understanding of the roles of eros and aidos in marriage we are now prepared to approach a real, but generally unobserved, problem in the narration of the central myth. This concerns the nature of the description of Cyrene herself and the ground of Apollo's feeling for her. In regard to the nymph, Pindar begins with a conventional epithet borrowed from the epic, in order to suggest her physical beauty: like Nausicaa, and others, she is said to have lovely arms or elbows.'6 But so much said, he proceeds at once (17-25) with an extraordinary description of a girl who abhors women's work: o E ravv i% Acvov OpE"ra-ro 7ra^ba Kvpavav. a u.Ev o 'o' a-rCv 7raAL/4,83a- /,ovs- E5L+A?)OEv ooovS., OvTrE EL7rvwv tOLKOVPLaV p.E0' E-raLpav -rpEILas-, 20 aAA' aKovrEaaLv TE XaAKEoLs 4aayaovcwp rc apvapAEva KEpaLfEV ayptovs- Oijpas-, q 7rOAAav TE Kat 7T1aXLov ,8 ovatv Edp?jvav 7rapExo0L-a 7rarp(paLs-, Tov 8E OVYKOLTOV YAVKVV 7raZpov E7rt yAXE4apoLs- 2 5 v'7rvov avaXaTKOLaa p'E7rovra 7pos aw. The unifying function of aLo&amp;s here is well recognised by Gildersleeve (above, note 3) 340, who writes, "This aLo&amp;s is the ap,ulos that binds the pair in wedlock. This intimate union is emphasized by vv6ov, ap,uo'CoLoa, ,.LOXOEvra." Gildersleeve compares ap,.oL6Cv at 127, where it is used of marriage. Cf. also ap,.oorrT of a betrothed husband at Poll. 3.35, and Eur. Troad. 665-66. The general interpretation of Pyth. 9.9-12 proposed here is also presented in a different context of explanation by A. Carson Giacomelli in her dissertation, Odi et amo, ergo sum (Toronto 1981). Though perceived from a great distance both in time and in spirit, there is a suggestive analogy with the familiar dictum of Rainer Maria Rilke, that "love consists in this, that two solitudes protect, and touch, and greet each other." 15According to one passage in our text of Pausanias (6.20.9), unmarried girls (Wrap&amp;EvoL) were not excluded from the great games at Olympia, but elsewhere (5.6.7) the same author speaks of an Elean law that prescribed the execution of women (yvvalKEs) who were caught entering Olympia or crossing the Alpheus. 16 Od. 6.101 and elsewhere.</page><page sequence="6">250 Leonard Woodbury Weaving is, of course, traditionally one of the skills of women, as we see (for instance) in passages of Homer in which women follow what Pindar here calls "the backward-pacing track of the loom," by the hearth in the central hall of the house.'7 The pleasures of dinners enjoyed among home-keeping companions are, on the other hand, almost unknown to us elsewhere, unless we can imagine that the girls of an ayE'Xa such as Alcman's maiden-chorus at Sparta or those of Sappho's O&amp;'ao-os at Mytilene enjoyed such entertainments. But whatever social relation between females may be the reference here, it is certain that these, like the normal feminine skill in weaving, are repudiated in this passage, in favour of the strenuous pleasures of hunting or, more probably, of repelling attacks made by wild beasts upon the domestic herds of cattle.8 Indeed, Apollo's first sight of Cyrene is one of her wrestling, unarmed, with a mighty lion. He is at once captivated, and calls Cheiron out from his cave to witness the wonder (26-35): KLXE VIV Ac'ovrt 7o0r' EVpv45apErpas- O&amp;l3p4ucp liovav wraAatomaav ,E yx, , e , ,.,'Aw \wv. alrEp WyeV eKaEpyos A- AAiV aV2rLKa 8' (K p.yiEYpwv Xt'pwva 7Tpoa07vErE 4OWvat 30 "-0,.Vov a'vrpov, ctDLAvpL'a, 7rpoAL7r&amp;v Ovp%ov yvvaucos- Kat c,EyaXav bvvao-Lv Oav4laoov, o'ov arap,3EZ VE?KOS ayEL KE4&gt;aAa, 10- XOOV KaOv7rEpOE vEavLv 1rop Exoura. 45o/3(,) o ov KEXEtuLavraL OpEvcsE. rtL vtv avOpc7rwv rEKEv; 7To'asg 8' a7roowrao-Eaoa 4vrAasv OpEAV KEVOMWOvas- .XEL TKLOEVTAv; 35 yEvETaL o' a`AKa &amp;a7rapa6vrov." The ground of his admiration is touched upon with insistent repetition when he says that her head is "dauntless," that "her spirit is unshaken by ' Cf., e.g., Penelope at Od. 1.355-57 and 2.94-95, Calypso at 5.61-63, Arete at 6.52-53 and 305-307, the Phaeacian serving-women at 7.105-11, Circe at 10.222, and Andromache at II. 6.490-93, 22.440. For the Greek contrast between women who sit at home and weave and their husbands who go out to earn a livelihood, see Soph. Oed. Col. 339 ff., where 343 (Kar-' OIKOV OZKOVpOi3OLV u'Ar'e 7rap0fvoL) recalls Pindar's toLKoVpQV /AEO' ETraLpav (19) in emphasising the demarcation of the feminine from the masculine space. On the function of the door in marking the limit of the oikos, and so of the women's world, see my remarks in TAPA 108 (1978) 297, note 35. In Pyth. 9.6 Cyrene is ayporepa precisely in transgressing any such limit. Cf. Hom. II. 11.548-54, where men and dogs, 7racvvvXoL Eyp?Jo'oVES , repel until dawn the attacks of a lion upon the cattle. Rightly, Burton (above, note 6) 42; contrast Farnell, Commentary (above, note 7) 203, who thinks of hunters that start at dawn. Note that Agave, in Euripides' Bacchae (1236-37), is said to desert the loom for the hunting of wild beasts. But Plutarch (Mul. Virt. 19:257e) has a story of one Aretaphila of Cyrene who, after saving her city from tyranny, withdrew into the women's quarters, where she worked quietly at her loom in the company of friends.</page><page sequence="7">Cyrene and the TEXEvra of Marriage in Pindar's Ninth Pythian Ode 251 storms of fear," and that she "enjoys an unbounded might of valour." The language and imagery are those of traditional verse, but ordinary Attic prose would call the virtue in question a'v8pEda.'9 That virtue may be shown both by men and by women, but its common name reveals that it is thought to be essentially male, a manly courage. It is for this reason that Cheiron calls Apollo's attention pointedly to "a woman's spirit and mighty powers" (30). The question must now arise: why is the first eros of the youthful Apollo roused by this girl, who eschews the female role, and flies instead to an opposite extreme, that of a rugged, masculine fearlessness? In seeking an answer, one is likely to hit immediately upon male homosexuality and the male image of Eros, both in poetry and in fine art. But fearlessness, in spite of Greek military homosexuality and the claims of its supporters,20 is not a traditional characteristic of the god Eros, nor of the eromenos, in whom the divinity is embodied.2' It is even more to the point that homosexuality is not in place in the myth of Cyrene and that there is nothing to show that the girl must be accommodated to the male erotic model in order to awaken the ardour of the god. On the contrary, Apollo's mind, as has been shown, is fixed upon marriage and the procreation of a son, so that we are left to wonder why Cyrene, the object of his desire, is conceived as she is. Here a key-insight is again offered by Hermann Frankel, who points out that a7rELpaVTrov is naturally taken to signify an evasion or denial of purpose and compares a similar passage on Atalanta in a poem from the Second Book of the Theognidea (1287-94):22 aAAa a-' Eyo TrpA) EvyorraV /,E, 's 7rorE 4aatv 'Ilao'ov KOVp?)V 7rapOc'vov 'Iaot't7v (pat?lv 7rEp Eova-av avatvo,.avxv yac4ov avbpov 1290 (EVylV- wTaMAEvq o' Epy' a&amp;TEAETa TEAEL wraTpov voaT4uO-EuTa oo4uwv eavO@ 'ATaAXvTtl WLXETo o V'II?XAa' E'L KopV4Pa' opewv 4EvyovO L'LEpoEvTa yaOP, ' AApoL'717T &amp;Wpa- TEAov ' EyVW Kat Aa'A avaLvo,uAEvx9. 19 The word &amp;vbpeia may sometimes be used of women, as in Soph.

So Helen's evasion at Aesch. Agam. 744-45 produced a bitter outcome (reAXvrai) of marriage. The Attic myth of Cecrops found the purpose of the institution of marriage in the transition from wildness to domestication: see Schol. Aristoph. Plut. 773.</page><page sequence="8">252 Leonard Woodbury Pindar's Apollo, Frankel suggests, has the same idea as the Theognidean lover, who rejects as E'py' a'To'Ea-Ta the life of a virgin-huntress, because it denies that marriage is the proper end (74,Aos) of women.23 But, Theognis adds, Atalanta had at last to accept that end, recalcitrant though she was (T74os 8' Ey vw KcaL /i a'a aat vo v,E) . A similar implication may be found in the vegetative imagery in which Apollo expresses his question concerning the girl: 7roLas 8' a7o-raoaOEiLa 4v-rAas / OpE'wv KEvOtwvas EXEL OKLOEVrTcv; (33-34). The verb used here in the form of a participle yields a strong sense in combination with c5vTAas: "from what stalk is she torn?" But the phrase is sufficiently rare to justify its being called "strange,"24 and we are once more grateful to Frankel for pointing out the parallel with the participle voo-w-OdEoLa in the same Theognidean poem on Atalanta. That nymph had "separated herself" from the tutelage of father and family and is thereby shown to be out of place, avoiding her 7E'Xos, as it were. The effect of the Pindaric passage is likely to be similar, and both passages recall Pindar's account of the fault of Coronis in the Third Pythian (12 ff.). For she, unlike Cyrene, anticipated the proper and public rites of marriage, fell in love with "what was not to hand" or "what was out of reach" (ra a&amp;rE'ovr-a and ra 7r70po-X) and, by implication, failed to limit herself to what she could hope to accomplish (23, 62). She betook herself to a marriage that was improper because it lacked her father's knowledge and consent and because she was bearing the seed of the god.2 There was to be a proper time and place for her marriage to a mortal man, but she, by her imprudent action, had attempted to evade and forestall that issue of events. Her rashness in regard to gamos may be set over against Cyrene's reluctance to play the woman's role, but the girls are alike in seeking to escape their natural and proper fulfilment. Like the Atalanta of the Theognidean verses, they are brought to terms, Coronis harshly, Cyrene lovingly, for the gods make their dispensations for us now in the one way, now in the other, as they see fit. If then the parallels between Cyrene and Atalanta hold, as they appear to hold, Cyrene is to be thought of as defying, by her acts of heroism, the rEAos, or 'rELpas,, of her being as a woman.26 Her fulfilment, that is to say, 2-3 The cognate synonym, TEXIEVTa, is used of the consummation of the marriage of Apollo and Cvrene at Pyth. 9.66. As by Burton (above, note 6) 44. Cf. Hom. Od. 6.286-88, where Nausicaa expresses her disapproval of any girl who should, without the consent of father and mother, have anything to do with men before reaching the time of public marriage. 26 It is possible that Pindar associates her heroism with her virginity, as alike defying her T'Ao's as a woman, just as Atalanta's acts are dismissed as aTEAEOTa (Theogn. 1290). Herodotus (4.180.2), at any rate, knows of a combat-ritual among the Libyans that is performed bv virgins, in which those who die of wounds received are called "false virgins"</page><page sequence="9">Cyrene and the TEAEvT-a of Marriage in Pindar's Ninth Pythian Ode 253 is to be found in her roles as wife and as mother of a son. The inference concerning Cyrene's defiance finds confirmation, at the end of the ode, in the myth of Danaus, for that hero, according to the story, overcame by the device of a race the objections of his daughters to marriage. And, by reverse, in the parallel myth of Antaeus, the girl is set at the end of the race-course to be the TEAos' aKpOV of her competing suitors. There is an end appointed in marriage, it appears, both for men and for women, one that is to be sought for and not to be avoided. So much for Cyrene's fighting-spirit. But to the Greek observer, schooled in traditional Greek wisdom, anything human that is boundless cries out for limitation.27 For all of us the TEA?) or q r,&amp;pa-a, that lie in the lap of the gods in the inscrutable future, are indubitably ahead: no one may escape them. Every human being must, willy-nilly, face the encounter with his rTAoso,28 as Theognis' Atalanta had to meet her fate. If he can learn in no other way, he must learn in the school of hard knocks. Apollo, as a well-brought-up Greek, must be thought to see that matter in no other way. It is the fate and the fulfilment of Cyrene to be a wife and mother, and to behold her marvellous feats of courage and strength is to understand what kind of son she can bear.29 In just this way, it was told of Atalanta (Apollod. 1.8.2) that Meleager, who fell in love with her, longed, not simply to possess her, but to have a child by her.30 Apollo, I (*Ev8o7rap0EvoL). If this idea is present in the Pindaric passage, then Cyrene's fight with the lion is proof, not only of her fearlessness, but also of her fiercely-guarded virginity. 2 Cf., e.g., Arist. Gen. An. 1.1.:715b: ?7 bE pv'oLs 0,EVyEL TO arTELpov' TO MAEv yap arELpov aTEAEsE, ?) 8E #Vcts a'EL C7)TE TEAOM. 21 So at 66 Apollo is urged to accomplish the TEAEVTa of marriage. For the idea of TE'AOs, TEAEVTac, and 7rEipap, see, e.g., Archil. frr. 111, 298, Semon. fr. 1.1-2, 5, Sol. fr. 13.17, 28, 58 IEG, Theogn. 136, 594, 660, and Eur. Or. 1545-46. 2" This interpretation of the Pindaric passage may shed some light on the Homeric habit of applying '4OO4tA7 to women and the Greek practice of giving to girls names such as Iphigeneia. For the adjective is readily intelligible when used of a monster such as the Laestrygonian princess (Od. 10.106), but puzzling when given (e.g.) to Penelope (16.332, where LSJ suggest, imaginatively, "comely, stately"). It is suggestive in this connection to notice that, at Od. 11.287, Pero, who bears this epithet, was the daughter of Amphion, who "ruled by might" (i#L avao'o'Ev) in Minyan Orchomenus, had three glorious brothers, was much sought after by suitors, but was reserved by her father for the man who could drive the cattle of "mighty Iphicles" (,83ts 'ItLKAEL'7js). The suggestion that the girl was good breeding-stock is strong. So also, at Apollod. 2.1.4, Iphinoe and Iphianassa are daughters of Stheneboea. Further, it may be that the problem presented by the use of 8a'cppwv at Od. 15.354 of Anttcleia, the mother of Odysseus, may be solved by the same hypothesis, for Alemena, who is described by this same epithet at line 84 of the Ninth Pythian, is there acknowledged as the mother of Heracles and Iphicles (bL8bi4uov KpaT?7,o'44axov o'OE'vos viiv); cf. Hes. Theog. 143. See however the discussion of this epithet by P. Chantraine, Dict. Etym. de la Langue Grecque 1 (1968) 248. 30 Another parallel is offered by the story of Meleager, as told in Bacch. 5.68-175. Meleager's father is said to be 0pao'v,AE,vwv (69), and his mother bai4pwv and an aTap'BK aOS yvva (137 and 139). Heracles, upon first seeing Meleager in the underworld,</page><page sequence="10">254 Leonard Woodbury take it, understood the same compulsion when he stood in the presence of Cyrene. It seems clear that marriage and procreation are on his mind, and his omniscience, which is praised by Cheiron, reveals to him with perfect clarity the TEAos that his youthful aidos prevents him from mentioning.3' The object of his desire is identical with Cyrene's fulfilment, and with fate. This is not, of course, to say that there is not a sexual element present. The candid anthropomorphism that pervades Pindar's description of the young god makes such an assumption unlikely, and it may well be that this element is present in the image of the girl wrestling unarmed with the lion. The image presumably owes much to traditional Cyrenean iconography and belief,32 but something more than an emblem may seem to be exhibited here, if we recall another incident from the myth of Atalanta. For Apollodorus relates (3.9.2) that, after Atalanta was married to Melanion, once when the pair were hunting they entered the precinct of Zeus and in that place, while enjoying the pleasures of love, were transformed into lions.33 The transformation must be thought to have been appropriate to a pair of ardent lovers, and it certainly can have no connection with Libyan life or emblematics, so that the lions in Atalanta's story must serve as a symbol of sexual power.34 If that is so, Apollo in Pindar's myth may be thought to feel as well as to know the end for which he makes. The fierceness with which Cyrene guarded both her own virginity and her father's cattle is a force that re-appears in the eros that it inspires in the god, much as the shy, individual aidos of god and maiden was reformed by eros into a bond of unity under Aphrodite's hand. As in his aidos, so in his eros Apollo resembles the Cyrenean girls whose eyes follow the victorious Telesicrates at the local games. He sees in was filled with wonder and asked at once about his parentage (84 ff.). Then, after hearing the story of the fierce and fearless Althaea, who in her anger condemned her son to death, for once Heracles wept tears of pity and asked whether Meleager had at home, in the house of Oeneus, a maiden-daughter, o-o' Vra'V atLyKLa, whom he might make his bride (155 ff.). Nothing is said in Bacchylides' narrative of the procreation of a son, though it was known to hearers of the poem that Hyllus was born to Heracles and Deianeira. But reverence for 'Ora and recognition of its importance to marriage are prominent. Like Cyrene, Althaea is the fearless mother of an heroic son; like Apollo, Heracles finds it worthwhile to make an enquiry about lineage. Cf. however G. Devereux in SO 42 (1968) 83, who finds homosexuality in the incident. 31 Cf. the phrase, 0s 7raVTwv TEAOs ol0-Oa, in Cheiron's description of Apollo's omniscience (44). 3- For illustrations of graphic representations of Cyrene's fight with the lion, see L.

The themes of the Pindaric myth are eros, aidos, and gamos, and the pattern of their relations is instructive. The desire that is eros aims, through gamos, at the procreation of children, which is the natural and desired fulfilment both of men and of women. Aidos, which serves the individual and his society through the protection and the adornment of virgins, male as well as female, is reformed in gamos to protect and enhance the union into which eros has brought the lovers. The pattern of the themes is repeated in myths that are told in the poem and imposes itself crisply upon the listener. It is not easy to believe that this effect is without relation to the expectations both of the victor Telesicrates himself and of the citizens of Cyrene in regard to him,35 and we recall that the poet reserves his pointed apostrophe of Telesicrates for the passage in which the girls of Cyrene are said to pray, without uttering a word, for such a husband or son. The closing scene from the indigenous myth, in which Alexidamus, victorious in the race for a bride, conducts his new wife by the hand through the ranks of the Libyan Nomads, is then seen as a gamos that is a mythical analogue of the actualities of 474.36 If this is right, then the repeated emphasis in the poem on the speed and immediacy of actions may refer to a marriage that followed closely upon a victory. The application of the parallel is not so difficult as to be incredible without confirmation, but it is in fact immediately supported by the force of the concluding word, for Alexidamus is said to have enjoyed many earlier triumphs of the same kind. But the long celebration of Telesicrates' earlier victories still rings in our ears, so that the identification of the Libyan victor of the myth with his descendant, the Cyrenean victor of the occasion, comes inevitably to mind.3" But if the identification of the two victors is justified, it is easy to find a parallel between two bridegrooms as well. This interpretation of Apollo's eros is confirmed by two of the epithets that are to be given to the divine Aristaeus, who is the child that is born ; Cf. Gildersleeve (above, note 3) 337: "It is hard to resist the impression of a prothalamion as well as of an epinikion." Notice the insistent repetition: 7ro'oLs (51), ya,uos (66, 112, 114), AvaO-T7)pET (106a), yapj3poL (116), vlu#Lov a'vbpa (118), not to mention ap,o'w (above, note 14). The great attention given to the nymph Cyrene in Pyth. 9, in contrast to the silence concerning her in Pyth. 4 and 5, may have its origin in the victor's circumstances on the occasion of the celebration of his victory. " As Alexidamus is presumably the ancestor implied at 105 (so the scholia: 2.221 and 240 Drachmann), the analogy between myth and actuality rests upon lineage. " The victory of the Libyan myth is both renowned (112) and swift (114, 119-21, 123 ff.), like the Pythian victory of Telesicrates (70, 73, 90, 97). The theme of speed recurs in the poem (29, 57, 67-68, 114a), binding the myths to the actualities.</page><page sequence="12">256 Leonard Woodbury to Cyrene. He is called Agreus and Nomios in his capacities, it appears, as hunter and herdsman.38 But these are just the functions performed by the virgin Cyrene and it was by her heroic performance of them that she awakened the wonder and love of the god.39 The omniscience of Apollo foresaw, we must suppose, that a child conceived by this woman must possess just the same fearless powers in these two capacities. Aristaeus is "the nearest helper of flocks" (64a, a`yXyLoov o3raova jtjAcwv), just as his mother had sacrificed her sleep by night to bring peace to her father's cattle. If this is the mother's contribution to the procreation of the child, what are we to take to be attributable to the father? Pindar's iconography, which is compelling in its symbolism, is suggestive in this regard. 7aL 8' 7TLyOVVL'8LOV Oa71oa-c4EvaL 3pEog a'-rair, VEKrap eV XAELXEr-L Kat a&amp;p/3poorav Tra4ozLOL, 0Otcrov- TaL Tf VLV a aVaTOV, Ziiva KaL 'ayvov 'A7roXAv', avbpaco-L Xacppa 4nL2XoL9, aL'y- XLt7TOV 7raova /IA7V, 65 'Aypea KaL No4LLov, TOIS Apwra&amp;ov KaXELv. In 64 the central phrase, azThpaci-t Xacp,a 4LAots ayXWto7 6,raova /u7AXwv, is evidently chiastic in form, with its individual words following the order, abccba, for men are set against flocks, delight against protection, and friendship against ready support. Then, the first half of the phrase, being concerned with men, is reflected back upon what immediately precedes, viz., "immortal Zeus and holy Apollo," for these constitute the source of joy and friendship for men.40 The second half, on the other 3h See U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Der Glaube der Hellenen 1 (Basel 1956) 244-45. The two activities are prominent, explicitly or implicitly, in the odes for Cyrene: see 6a-7, 20 ff., 58; Pyth. 5.58 ff. Herodotus, in his account of Libya (4.168 ff.), knows of areas haunted by wild beasts (174, 181, 191-92) and he distinguishes pastoral from agricultural lands (172, 183, 191, 198-99). The native Libyans are called "Nomads" by Pindar in this poem (123), as well as by Herodotus (4.186 ff.); this implies a style of life that is appropriate to a hunting and herding people. i N4os' is an e.pithet shared historically by Apollo and Aristaeus: see L. R. Farnell, The Cults of the Greek States 4 (Oxford 1907) 123-24. But in the Ninth Pythian it is Aristaeus who bears the title, and Apollo is little more than a boy, being still enrolled in Cheiron's school, so that his time as herdsman, in the service of Admetus, is still to come. He is not yet No\4uos and could not have imparted to Aristaeus a capacity for herding. The Scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes (pages 169-70 Wendel) derives the two epithets of Aristaeus from Cyrene, &lt;'Aype'a 1.Ev,&gt; otrL 4Ev &amp;ypc, ey?u Ty l 1.'9TpL avrov o 'A7n'XXwv- N 'LV be, O'TL vEMoVaYn T?) 7 .a)pL E4y?), though he knows also the viewv that attributed the respective functions to Apollo. Pindar's understanding of the Cyrenean origin of the pastoral element in the myth seems clear enough, but perhaps historically there has been more confusion of things Greek with things Libyan (see note 10 above). lt seems certain that KaXeLP in 65 is epexegetic of O?JoovTraL in 63, as Gildersleeve saw. But if the construction is so long suspended, it is awkward and dangerous to demand that it</page><page sequence="13">Cyrene and the TeAEvTa of Marriage in Pindar's Ninth Pythian Ode 257 hand, is prospective, looking forward to the epithets Agreus and Nomios, because it is just the divinity of hunting and herding who is the first and nearest protector of sheep. But, if the attributes of the second half of the passage are the gift of the mother, it is easy to believe that the father is held to be the source of the attributes praised in the first half. Indeed, it must be the case that the identification of the Libyan divinity as Apollo is an inheritance from his father. The addition of Zeus suggests that Apollo is responsible for all that is Greek and Olympian in the new god, whereas Cyrene is, as has been argued, the source of the indigenous elements of the Libyan culture of the wild and of pastures, of hunting and herding.4 If the matter is considered in this way, it is possible to see what bound the omniscient god thought to impose on the unbounded might of the virgin-nymph. His contribution, as god and as male, is to the joy and change in the course of its progress, as we must if we follow many editors (Gildersleeve and Sandys are notable exceptions) in printing a comma at the end of 63 and construing "will make him immortal" before shifting to the required "will cause him to be called." Gildersleeve illustrates the true construction by citing Eur. Phoen. 12-13: Kaxov?oL b' 'IoKa'T7)V ye' TOVTO yap 7TaT7p / EBETO. One might add other examples, such as Ion 75: "Iwva b' aivrOV ... 0"vo,Aa KEK?f0'OaL 0BrjrETal. Sentences such as these show, as Gildersleeve observed, that TL'fOOrOal and KaAXLV are not simply synonymous; in fact, the two verbs are the means of distinguishing between the institution and the use of names. In the Pindaric context the institution is the symbolic, "baptismal" act performed by Earth and the Horae, while use of the name is the consequence for men of that primal name-giving. Nor is KaAXLv distinguished as opinion from knowledge, for, by a convention of archaic language and thought, KaXELo'OaL is ltvac: see LSJ s.v. KaE'w 11.2, Pyth. 1.67-68, where the happy fate that the poet invokes for the new city of Aetna is conceived to be determined by the E`TVMOV Xoyov avpWv7rv, and Pyth. 3.67, where KEKXMAE'vOv means "some one who is"; cf. Hom. H. Cer. 79-80. On the relation between KaXJLv and being, see my discussion in HSCP 63 (1958) 155-56 and note 34, and for naming and being, cf. Parm. fr. B9 VS. The construction suggested for the Pindaric passage also permits a symmetry in aOavaTov Zijva and ayvov 'A7rAXXwv', both styles having a traditional and quasi-liturgical effect. aOavaT0o is an epithet of Zeus at II. 21.2, etc. and of Thetis at Pyth. 3.10. Schroeder's doubts about the voice of 07'COVTaL and inclination to derive the form from OijoOaL, "suckle," after an indication in the scholia, are misplaced. The active form would mean "make, effect," as it does in an earlier passage of the Ninth Pythian (7), where an infinitive also follows; cf. also Od. 5.136: 0&amp;vaI TLva aOavaroV Ka't ay-pwv. The middle signifies a more particular form of causation, the act of making one's own: see LSJ s.v. TLO7)ML B.I.3. The Horae and Earth make the child their own by conferring on him in "baptism" his divine names; this act, by the convention mentioned, then has the effect of making him divine in regard to the functions signified by the names. Cf. the "baptism" of the infant lamus at 01. 6.56-57: TO Ka'L KaTEcaM1L EV KaXELo'OaL vLv XPo'v cVpravTI aTnp / TOVT 'VOMO' c0varov, where the main verb makes plain that the institutional act is one of speech. l The indigenous myth of the marriage of Alexidamus commemorates the union of a Greek man with a Libyan woman, such as must have been common in the colony. Note that at Hdt. 4.16.4 Arcesilaus III is said to have had a wife who was of his own kin, though her father, who was king of Barce, had the un-Greek name of Alazir. See also Callim. Hymns 2.85-87. The combination of races and cultures seems therefore likely to be an element in the poem. See F. Chamoux, Cyrene sous la monarchie des Battiades in BEFAR 177 (1953) 129, 223.</page><page sequence="14">258 Leonard Woodbury friendship that unite gods and men in the Greek society, while she gives to the child the powers of the land that nurture the city. He is Greek, she Libyan;42 his is the knowledge, hers the courage.43 Aristotle, in his own more abstract and systematic way, might say that he is form and she, matter." 42 The Pindaric Scholiast (2.238 Drachmann) states that, according to Peisander of Cameirus (fr. 6 Kinkel), the name of Antaeus' daughter was Alkeis. This prompts a comparison with Pindar's attribution (35) to Cyrene of aWKas a7rELpaVrov and the Scholiast's knowledge (2.223 Drachmann) of a sister named Alkaia. The Libyan component in the life of the colony is thus conceived by both myths in a similar way. But the figure of Antaeus himself in our poem, if 'AVTa&amp;'ov in 106 depends upon the following Kos$pav and Antaeus is the 7rar4p of 111, is imagined in a form very different from that presented by Pindar in Isth. 3/4, composed for a Theban at about the same period as Pyth. 9. There Antaeus appears as a savage giant whose barbaric practices are terminated by Heracles. It is natural to suppose that this image of the native Libyan element was accepted in Greece itself, but much modified in Cyrene, where the settlers had intermarried with the indigenous inhabitants. Just so, Pindar varies his presentation of Neoptolemus to suit a Delphic, or an Aeginetan, audience. See my "Neoptolemus at Delphi," Phoenix 33 (1979) 95-133. But contrast, with regard to Pyth. 9, the view of W. T. Magrath in TAPA 107 (1977) 221-22. 43 The images of "mixing" (13) and "fitting together" (apMdoW, 13, 117), which are applied in the poem to gamos, are appropriate also to the notion of the combination of father and mother, Greek and Libyan, knowledge and courage in the procreation of the child.
