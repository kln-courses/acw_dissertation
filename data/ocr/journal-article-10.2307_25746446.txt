<plain_text><page sequence="1">456 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) Joan Gordon Talking (for, with) Dogs: Science Fiction Breaks a Species Barrier "I am not an animal." ... "All the animals say that."?Gene Wolfe, "Tracking Song" (179) In making me you made something that sees man from clean outside man, and can tell him what he looks like.?Olaf Stapledon, Sirius (91) This paper is part of my ongoing study of a figure I call the amborg, who represents the interface among humans and other animals in a variety of ways.1 Amborgs will appear throughout this paper, and several may sit in the audience as well. One way in which humans and other animals interact is through the attempt to communicate with one another, and we try most sincerely, perhaps, in the human/dog companion relationship. This attempt is explored in a number of sf stories, where scientific extrapolation and subjunctive "what if speculation allow us to overhear how that communication might occur. The result is sometimes mere whimsy, but often reflects genuine grappling with questions of authority, otherness, consciousness, and embodiment. Considering Gayatri Spivak's subaltern and Donna Haraway's companion species, but also the observations and conclusions of the ethologist Konrad Lorenz, the sociologists Arnold Arluke and Clinton Sanders, and the animal trainer and philosopher Vicki Hearne, among others, I look at three sf works: Clifford Simak's classic City (1952) and two twenty-first-century texts, Sheri S. Tepper's The Companions (2003) and Kij Johnson's "The Evolution of Trickster Stories Among the Dogs of North Park After the Change" (2007). I have previously written of how one can imagine the gaze exchanged between human and other as a reciprocity between subjects rather than as a domination of object by subject ("Gazing Across the Abyss"): to gaze not only at the other but through the eyes of the other, and to acknowledge the gaze returned. Here I explore ways in which science fiction allows one to speculate about how communication might similarly be exchanged between species, resulting in what Haraway might see as figurative interspecies epig?nesis, a feedback relationship resulting not in the speech of the subaltern, but in speaking between "alterns." To imagine this is to break down one of the most common differentiations between the human?an animal with speech?and a separate category of the animal, speechless and inferior?and instead to offer both a more generous definition of language itself and a more observant description of the ways in which humans and other animals communicate with one another. My word amborg, which echoes Haraway's cyborg, is meant to reflect such a dynamic relationship between humans and other animals rather than seeing them as a mutually exclusive set of categories. Just as the cyborg represents the human/machine interface, the amborg represents the human/other animal interface. The amborg recognizes that while humans are a unique biological</page><page sequence="2">SF BREAKS A SPECIES BARRIER 457 species, we are also animals, and that other animals share with us much more than we have previously been willing to acknowledge. An amborg need not be part human, either?whenever any species forms an interface with another, as when a wolf raises another species, or when my dog raised a kitten, they too would be amborgs. Indeed, it is my claim that biology, philosophy, and science fiction are coming to see the relationships among animal species in terms of flows and fuzzy sets, just as the new physics emphasizes flows, continua, fuzzy sets, and complex systems. The amborg, then, is a liminal creature that acknowledges reciprocity, not just on the part of humans deigning to recognize our family tree, or rhizome, or maybe network, but on the part of any animals that interact with and acknowledge the presence, the sentience, even the consciousness and the subjectivity of one another. The amborg represents a mutually influential feedback loop between beings, as they change and are changed by one another. Carol McGuirk reminds us that Cordwainer Smith would call this way of being "life-with," and her paper suggests ways to broaden the discussion at the level of the body politic. Sherry 1 Vint explores the ethical ramifications of this changed episteme in the realm of biopolitics. I will be considering amborgs in a more intimate, less political way. While the amborg is not a science-fictional creature but a metaphorical one, science fiction, which literalizes such metaphors, is perfectly suited to imagine it. Gay atri Spivak's landmark essay in postcolonial theory, "Can the Subaltern Speak?" (1988), warns against the intellectual who speaks "for" the downtrodden, the masses, the third-worlder, the colonized or formerly colonized, the woman: in other words, the human designated as the Other. As she says, "The theory of pluralized 'subject-effects' gives an illusion of undermining subjective sovereignty while often providing a cover for this subject of knowledge" (66). She points out the error that lies in "the positivist inclusion of a monolithic collectivity" in speaking of, or for, any group, including one's own (73). "We," those who believe we can speak for the Other, see Them as an undifferentiated mass, a view we do not consider for ourselves. When we speak for them we deny their own ability to speak for themselves, even though they are, of course, perfectly capable of speech, and we deny them the audience that will listen and respond to their various, individuated, "situated knowledges," to use Haraway's term. People perceived as the Other are perceived as The other, as Derrida notes when he coins the word animot because he "would like to have the plural animals heard in the singular. There is no Animal in the general singular, separated from man by a single, indivisible limit" (47), no monolithic The animal but only the multiplicity of various and individuated animals. But human others have language and animals do not. At least, we have managed to define language in such a way as to make it our exclusive property, just as dogs, for example, might define barking as their exclusive property if, indeed, they were concerned with marking themselves off from other species, something which we cannot know. Ethologists, in their study of animal behavior, however, observe animals in order to figure out how they perceive the world and how they communicate. Konrad Lorenz, in his classic Man Meets Dog (1949), describes, in the chapter called "What a Pity He Can't Speak?He Understands</page><page sequence="3">458 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) Every Word," how dogs communicate through "expressive movements," by means of the positions of their ears and tails, for instance: a "'vocabulary' of signals" which Lorenz assigns to "instinctive, inherited behaviour patterns" ( 126), although he allows that "A particularly intelligent dog... may... invent better and more complex ways of making itself understood" (128). Vicki Hearne and Donna Haraway, who combine their interests in dog training with their philosophical work, go quite a bit further. Hearne, in fact, claims that dogs not only have language but that they talk back. In Animal Happiness (1994), she gives language a particularly generous (i.e., not anthropocentric) definition: "One of the things language does is to create an overlapping awareness between two speakers, or a writer and a reader.... The overlapping in awareness is language itself (136). She sees that "overlapping in awareness" all the time in dog training, when dog and human negotiate what each wants of the other: Dogs do talk back, all the time. The (almost entirely forgotten) goal of obedience training is to rectify the tilt in exchange, relationship, language, so as to make answering back, talking back as well as answering, a given, but the language that arises between people and dogs is not fully cultural in the way a language that arises between creatures with the capacity for writing is, in that it cannot so readily be recorded in the memory of the tribe, so each instance of the language is at least a dialect. (134) We are familiar with the willfulness of dogs when we expect them to obey and they make clear to us their disagreement and alternate preference. In that exchange, Hearne argues, is a kind of language. She argues further that "People who claim to speak for animal rights and/or animal liberation" are speaking for animals in the way that Spivak says Western intellectuals speak for other human beings. Only the person who is in what Hearne calls "a rights relationship" of reciprocal possession and knowledge (209) has that right: "I am the only one who can own up to my Airedale's rights, and he is the only one who can own up to or refuse my rights in relationship to him" (213). My point here is not to argue whether Hearne is correct about animal rights but to show how different her view of language is, a view that allows for other possibilities than the human, and that considers what it means to speak for the other. Donna Haraway talks about differences in theories of what language is, and who has it, in a useful note to one of the chapters of When Species Meet (2008). Here she notes interdisciplinary approaches "among evolutionary biologists, anthropologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists" that "argue that a distinction should be made between functional language in the broad sense (FLB) and language in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB is composed of many interacting subsystems (sensorimotor and computational-intentional) that do not necessarily evolve as a unit.... The only uniquely human component of the language faculty (FLN) is recursion" (372-73), the ability to generate infinite expressions from limited elements. Again, as in Hearne, the definition of language is broadened to include what other animals are saying. Again, she sees language as reciprocal between species. Describing her conversation with her Australian shepherd, Cayenne, Haraway says: "We have had forbidden conversation: we have had oral intercourse; we are bound in telling story on story with nothing but the facts. We</page><page sequence="4">SF BREAKS A SPECIES BARRIER 459 are training each other in acts of communication we barely understand. We are, constitutively, companion species" (16). In their language exchange they exhibit "interspecies epig?nesis," or a feedback process of "reciprocal induction within and between always-in-process critters" (32). One does not speak for the other or instead of the other: both are amborgs. We do speak for the other, however, in our imaginings about animal language, where we transform FLB into FLN, literalizing the broader, more generous definition of language into the more specific human definition. Paradoxically, the science fiction I examine here makes a space where animals can speak back so that we understand, but these stories can only do so by speaking for animals. In fact, this is a paradox that surrounds the whole field of animal studies. Spivak makes it clear that Western intellectuals need to shut up and listen to the human others. Hearne and Haraway argue that, in the case of animal others, some people do listen and, when they speak for the animal, it is based on that listening Sociologists Arnold Arluke and Clinton Sanders discuss exactly this issue, based in part upon Sanders's observations in a veterinary clinic. Recognizing dogs as "virtual persons" because of their close family connections as companion animals, they note that "the owner learns to 'read' gaze, vocalizations, bodily expressions, and other communicative acts" (66) : functional language in the broad sense. After discussing various ways in which humans speak for their dogs in the vet's office, they point out that the human, who knows the individual animal, can "judge divergences from normality" for that animal while the doctor "is trained to judge divergence from species normality" (71 ; emphasis in original). Thus, the human's anthropomorphic (not anthropocentric) act, speaking as if in the voice of the dog, is a useful part of the examination. While no one can know how accurate or "true" the performance is, the authors point out that the value lies, as it does in our assumptions about human others, in "whether these understandings work to establish communication ... and sustain a viable and mutually rewarding flow of interaction" (79), what Hearne would call an overlapping in awareness. Thus, this particular kind of anthropomorphic behavior may be considered "critical anthropomorphism" (Gordon Burghardt's term, cited in Arluke and Sanders 80), and it has important value. As Arluke and Sanders conclude: The natural attitude in which companion animals and other nonhuman actors are regarded as minded, emotional, and intentional?and whose orientations and interests can be spoken for with some degree of validity?has the practical utility of allowing the construction of effective and mutually rewarding patterns of social interaction. Additionally, this perspective casts non-human animals as worthy of moral concern. (81) To mash-up Spivak, Haraway, and Hearne, this kind of "speaking for" attempts to avoid seeing animals as "a monolithic collectivity" (Spivak), instead performing acts of "interspecies epig?nesis" (Haraway) that make possible "a rights relationship" (Hearne). It is an attempt to see both humans and dogs as what I would call amborgs, influencing and interacting with one another. Science fiction allows us to listen to and understand the (admittedly speculative) response and reciprocation when animals speak back while, at the same time, speaking for those animals, enacting a kind of critical</page><page sequence="5">460 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) anthropomorphism. Most sf that imagines dogs talking back is of the sort called animal uplift, stories in which human technology makes it possible for dogs to speak. This is true in the sublime Sirius (1944) by Olaf Stapledon, and the more satirical Heart of a Dog (written 1925, published 1987) by Mikhail Bulgakov, to name two earlier and wonderful examples.2 It is true also in two of the texts I will discuss here, Simak's City and Tepper's The Companions. City imagines a future in which human beings have compromised the planet through warfare, overpopulation, and ecological damage. Solutions to the problems include emigration to other planets, a return to rural life, and, most surprising, surgical and somehow inheritable Lamarckian intervention in dogs so that they are equipped to become the next dominant species. This last is explained in the most cavalier of ways, reminding us that science fiction does not always stress plausible science. The primary intervention in dogs is to give them speech, FLN, which leads to a gradual deepening of their intelligence. The goal is to bring the two species into a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship in which two (kinds of) heads are better than one. Or at least this is the claim in the novel's third chapter. The novel is structured as a series of origin stories by the dogs, explaining their deep history, told as myths more fictional than real about mythical creatures called humans. Each chapter is a different "myth" and is surrounded by commentary from a dog narrator in the far future. Embedded in the whimsical speculation about how dogs might come to be the ascendant race is a more thought-provoking one about how speech might bring intelligence rather than the other way around. The fourth chapter, called "Desertion," suggests that speech not only aids in evolving intelligence, but also allows it to be recognized. In this "myth," humans are attempting to settle in Jupiter's hostile climate by transforming themselves into native creatures they call Lopers. Human after human is sent out in transformed shape onto the planet, disappearing into the violent landscape and never returning to report any findings. Finally, the man in charge of the mission decides he must go himself into what he believes is certain death, and decides to take his dog, who somehow has come along on the expedition. He imagines that the dog would prefer this certain death rather than remain abandoned in the safety of a protective dome on the surface of the planet?he attempts to speak for the dog, limited as he is in any ability to exchange unambiguous communication with another species. Nevertheless, knowing the individual animal, he has presumably learned to read the dog's "communicative acts," as the dog has learned to read his, to use Arluke and Sanders's words. The instant man and dog are thrust out into the Jovian atmosphere, transformed into Lopers, they learn why no one had come back before. To native eyes, the planet is beautiful and beneficent, and, what is more, the two companions can communicate perfectly with one another: "Not words really, better than words. Thought symbols in his brain, communicated thought symbols that had shades of meaning words could never have" (113). The man is amazed that his dog can talk and the dog replies, "I always talked to you, but you couldn't hear me." When the man says, "I understood you sometimes," the dog replies,</page><page sequence="6">SF BREAKS A SPECIES BARRIER 461 "Not very well.... You knew when I wanted food and when I wanted a drink and when I wanted out, but that's all you ever managed" (113). The problem, then, and it lies more in the human than in the animal in this exchange, is the inadequacy of the language. The human attempted critical anthropomorphism with limited success. Once the communication has been improved, changed from FLN to FLB, the intelligence of both improves by amazing leaps. When they consider returning to the dome, it is seen as a return to a sadly limited FLN described as "the flapping mouths that formed signals others understood" (116) but which would mean the end to "a comradeship no one had ever known before?that no man, no dog had ever known before" (117). Having experienced the communication made possible by their shared Loper bodies, which erase bodily difference, how can they return to the communication in which the human attempted to speak for the dog and failed? Only here, through a shared embodiment and the resulting shared language, does the authority of one fall away and can the two enjoy a "comradeship" that acknowledges both otherness and reciprocal consciousnesses.3 The two, once they reciprocate communication, enjoy a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. When we consider our relationships with dogs, we usually think of the relationship as one of mutually beneficial symbiosis, seeing ourselves as what Haraway calls companion species, "training each other in mutual acts of communication.... Significantly other to each other" (Companion 2-3) and "Telling a story of co-habitation, co-evolution, and embodied cross-species sociality" (Companion 4). Sheri Tepper tells a less optimistic story of "embodied cross-species sociality," one that suggests for much of her novel that the relationship is not mutually advantageous but is instead an example of amensalism. Biologist and animal trainer Raymond Coppinger and animal trainer and writer Lorna Coppinger, in their book Dogs: A New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior, and Evolution (2001), define amensalism as "the biological relationship in which one species is not affected by the association, but the other species, by accident, is hurt by it" (228). They go on to suggest that humans and dogs are, "from the behavioral ecologist's point of view," in "a new category called reciprocal amensalism. It is bad for humans because of the economic and health problems created by large populations of dogs, and at the same time it is bad for dogs" because of harmful eugenic breeding practices and restrictive living conditions (252). What feels like a reciprocal relationship of "significant otherness" in which communication is mutual, for Haraway and Hearne, and in Simak's book?or at least helpful, as for Arluke and Sanders?looks different to the Coppingers, and to Sheri Tepper. Her novel describes humans living on an overpopulated earth where few other animals are permitted. When the destruction of all non-human animals is legislated, a group takes off-planet their "big dogs," engineered by humans to be "bigger, healthier, smarter... no, I couldn't say smarter when I didn't know how smart they'd been before people had fooled with them. Maybe not smarter, but far better able to communicate" (108). Although the dogs can speak, the narrator, Jewel, acknowledges that "I could not think as they thought. I could not see as they saw, nor sense as they sensed" (109). Unlike the comrades in City, humans</page><page sequence="7">462 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) and animals here are differently embodied and therefore not in perfect communication; speech does not necessarily add to the dogs' intelligence, it only allows humans to acknowledge it?all along, as we will learn, the dogs had been thinking their own thoughts. In the course of a typical Tepper adventure plot, a variety of alien beings demonstrates a variety of attitudes toward ecology, gender, and the Other through wars and revelations too numerous to relate here. One of the revelations is that, although we had thought of the dogs as under human control, having been "fooled with," after all, by humans, they "have been in charge of their own lives.... We don't give them orders because they won't follow orders. We ask them if they will comply with suggestions" (278), much as Vicki Hearne describes. Furthermore, we have been infected (by evil aliens) with certain "dog virtues: pride and packishness" which are fine in dogs but "a grievous harm to manipulating speaking creatures" (537). Through this malign "cross-species epig?nesis," we damage dogs and they damage us: we all arrive at a state of "reciprocal amensalism," somehow exacerbated for both parties through the ability to speak. Finally, however, the curse of reciprocal amensalism is lifted (by good aliens), and the dogs, who had abandoned humans to live in pride and packishness, begin to miss them: one dog asks for forgiveness "for... having enslaved you, all those tens of thousands of years ago." And the human protagonist, Jewel, says, "It doesn't matter who enslaved whom.... What matters is we were together. What matters is all that time we kept one another from being entirely evil." They can come to this mutual understanding through the ability to speak, the same ability that had divided them, recognizing what the human calls "A dear, dear Otherness" (548). They are granted the symbiotic blessing of mutualism, or "mutual benefit" (Coppinger 28), with neither party speaking for the other, neither a "subaltern," but both significantly other and in a conversation between "alterns." They both benefit from the critical anthropomorphism that allows each to acknowledge the mindedness and moral claim of the other. Again, as in City, improved communication makes possible the "overlapping in awareness" that forms the dynamic amborg relationship. Kij Johnson does not allow such a happy ending in "The Evolution of Trickster Stories Among the Dogs of North Park After the Change," the only one of these works in which dogs evolve speech themselves with no "uplift" from human agents, even though "When the Change happened, it affected all the mammals we have shaped to fit our own needs" (2). This story allows instead for significant otherness in the two species, individuated consciousnesses that refuse the notion of any "monolithic collectivity" that forces dogs, or humans, into the position of the other, the animal. But the result is not very comforting: "a new era in cross-species understanding. But nothing ever works out quite as we imagine.... [T]hey all could frame their thoughts well enough to talk.... And we found that, really, we prefer our slaves mute" (2).The dogs?bred, fed, fenced, and fixed by humans?are the real slaves here, and their reactions are as varied as those of human slaves. Most people, once they know their dogs can speak, drive them away: "Sometimes we think we want to know what our dogs think. We don't, not really. Someone who watches us with unclouded eyes and sees who we really are</page><page sequence="8">SF BREAKS A SPECIES BARRIER 463 is more frightening than a man with a gun" (3). Here is another portrayal of the human/dog relationship; this time it is not mutually beneficial but reciprocally amensal. Here, the dogs who have spent their lives spoken for in the vet's office, reveal the flaws in their "owners'" interpretations. The human protagonist, Linna, visits a park where dogs congregate and listens to their trickster stories about "One dog." Indeed, that is the key: as a dog says of Linna, "She listens, that's all" (12). She does not attempt to speak for them, although once in a while she speaks with them. Having listened to their stories about "one dog" (not "the dog") she says: (When we first fashioned animals to suit our needs, we treated them as if they were stories and we the authors, and we clung desperately to an imagined copyright that would permit us to change them, sell them, even delete them. But some stories cannot be controlled. A wise author or dog owner listens, and learns, and says at last, "I never knew that.") (21) These are Linna's last words in the story, but a dog tells one last story about one dog and so we too are left listening to a dog. Linna is suggesting that we enter into what Hearne calls a "rights relationship" with our dogs, so that they are no longer ours except in the same way that we are theirs. Johnson's story suggests that it is unlikely that dogs will be coming back and asking us for forgiveness, as the dogs do in The Companions, and that apologies are useless for us to make to dogs. The communication that Arluke and Sanders' dog "owners" employ is, here, admittedly deeply problematic, but it is also absolutely vital. However flawed this communication is, it permits mutual mindedness and morality, when humans are courageous enough to listen hard. In the brave new world that has such dogs in it, Johnson speculates that "Some will find homes with men and women who treat them not as slaves but as friends, freeing themselves, as well" (21). True mutually beneficial symbiosis cannot exist between the hegemony and the undifferentiated other, only between two subjects who speak?whether in FLB or FLN?with rather than for one another, as significant others, as alterns, and who listen as well. These subjects, too, are amborgs, although less Utopian, more rare, franker about what they see in one another, and more difficult than we might wish. Johnson does not allow the sentimental bond between companion species for which so much sf, and so many of us, long. Amborgs require empathy instead. In Melancholia's Dog: Reflections on Our Animal Kinship (2006), Alice Kuzniar sees an inevitable sadness in this recognition of the imperfection of our communication with dogs: melancholia means that, however close we are to the canine pet, that closeness can never be enough and we are always conscious of the obliqueness and imperfection that govern our communication with it.... But the ideal of crossing that barrier motivates... writers and artists... they attempt to come closer to the animal, all the while melancholically despairing at not being able to do so. (11) While all these stories imagine ways to cross the barrier of communication, they all acknowledge, and must necessarily illustrate, the impossibility of doing so.</page><page sequence="9">464 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) Nevertheless, we continue to try, in science, in sociology, in animal studies, and in science fiction. NOTES 1. How appropriate that this paper about communications between species is being given within a Utopian space for communication?a community of scholars. I am grateful to both Carol McGuirk and Sherryl Vint for their inspiring contributions to the discussion here, which have advanced my own thinking about animals. I'd also like to thank Rob Latham, the staff at the Eaton Collection, SFS, and the audience of this symposium. 2. A few other examples of science fiction with talking dogs are: Gene Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer (1980) and "The Dog of the Drops" (2002), Harlan Ellison's "A Boy and His Dog" (1969), Jeff Noon's Pollen (1995), Nancy Kress's "Dancing on Air" (1993), Geoff Ryman's Air, or, Have Not Have (2005), and Kirsten Bakis's Lives of the Monster Dogs (1997). 3. While "Desertion" ends in a beautiful reciprocity of interspecies understanding, the story's frame within City problematizes that understanding. The dog who writes the commentary before the next story says, "we learn of the limited communications which it [the human race] possessed, a situation which certainly is not conducive to advancement" (117). In the next story, Fowler has left his dog on Jupiter, abandoning comradeship and what we learn is the Juwain philosophy (i.e., that of the Lopers), which "provides an ability to see the viewpoint of another" (135).

New York: Tor, 1997. 167-224. ABSTRACT This article is part of my ongoing study of a figure I call the amborg, which represents the interface between species in a variety of ways. One way in which humans and other animals interact is through the attempt to communicate, and we try most sincerely, perhaps, in the human/dog relationship. This attempt is explored in a number of science fiction stories, where scientific extrapolation and subjunctive "what if speculation allow us to overhear how that communication might occur. The result sometimes reflects genuine grappling with questions of authority, otherness, consciousness, and embodiment. Working with Gayatri Spivak' s concept of the subaltern and Donna Haraway ' s companion species, but also the observations and conclusions of animal ethologists, I look at three sf works: Clifford Simak's City (1952), Sheri S. Tepper's The Companions (2003), and Kij Johnson's "The Evolution of Trickster Stories Among the Dogs of North Park After the Change" (2007). I explore ways in which sf allows writers to speculate on how species communicate, resulting in what Haraway might see as figurative interspecies epig?nesis: not the speech of the subaltern, but speaking between "alterns." To imagine this possibility is to break down one of the most common differentiations between the human (as unique possessor of language) and the separate, inferior category of animal, instead offering a more generous definition of language itself and a more observant description of the ways in which humans and other animal beings communicate with one another.</page></plain_text>
