(}ber die Grenzen der nalurwissenschaftlichen BegrTffsbildung. MAX FRISCHEISEN-K6HLER. Ar. f. sys. Ph., XII, 2, pp. 225-266; 4, pp. 450-483. I. These articles are devoted to a critical examination, from the logical point of view, of Rickert' s Die Grenzen der naturwissenschafllichen Begrzfs- bildung (I 902), which, owing to its clearness and systematic character, holds a central place in recent discussions of the relations of the methods of history and of natural science. Rickert's starting-point, unlike that of other writers in this field, is not the psychological basis of the mental sciences, nor the difference in the subject-matter of the various branches of science, but the difference in their aims. History, as the science of the actual (Wirklich- keilswissenschafl), employs an entirely different method of forming con- cepts (BegriJfsbildung) from that of the natural sciences (sciences of law) as set forth in the traditional logical doctrine of the concept. To overcome the immeasurable multiplicity of its data, natural science resorts to abstract, universal concepts and laws; in so doing, however, it loses its hold on concrete reality, whereas the concepts of history have always, according to Rickert, a concrete and individual content. But the validity of Rickert's account of the natural science concept is open to question. Scientific ab- straction is not a generalization or simplification for its own sake, but an isolation or analysis of certain elements, without ignoring the rest. And while scientific laws are universal, embracing what is common to a whole class of objects, their necessity and validity can by no means be deduced from this fact. The modern view that the connection of cause and effect is constitutive for the whole of nature, and the laws to which this view has led, carry us far beyond the ' reference to the universal' which Rickert so strongly emphasizes. The ideal of a ' le/ze Naturwissenschaft' as a sort 343</page><page sequence="2">344 THE PRILOSOPIICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. of pure mechanics, deducing all laws from a single highest law and all ' things' from qualitatively and quantitatively simple and uniform elements, is not a satisfactory formulation of present scientific tendencies, nor is it implied in Rickert's premises. It does not apply to psychology, which constitutes a second ' ultimate natural science '; but if two, why not more ? Rickert criticises as rationalistic the view that scientific concepts are more than abstractions; but his own ideal here suggests Spinozistic- rationalism. In science the discovery of the actual structure of things is itself an end; not merely a means to abstract theoretical constructions; science aims not so much to overcome as to understand the manifold of empirical reality. The atoms of chemistry are not mere fictions, like mathematical points, in- capable of being given in experience, but may be interpreted as the smallest particles of matter which science can reach, and hence as no less knowable in principle than stars or planets. And however abstract pure mechanics may become, it ldses all extra-mathematical interest as soon as its relation to the actual world of experience is lost. Of course no part of reality can be exhaustively described in words and concepts; but this is as true in the historical as in the natural sciences. If the procedure of natural science is analysis and not there abstraction, there is no evident reason why it cannot by synthesis return and deal with reality. By combining several concepts, even though each is by itself poorer than the given reality, we may approxi- mate indefinitely to the concretely real. And the part that cannot be deduced, the connection of the various concepts, is precisely what we have before us as actually given. In astronomy we gain a knowledge of the laws that govern individual things, and are enabled to predict their move- ments. Nor is the case of astronomy exceptional; other sciences approxi- mate in varying degrees to this predictive knowledge of individual phe- nomena. Every science of the real has its irrational given data; but this fact does not constitute a limitation of the natural-science method; in theory, at any rate, the science of the future will be able to determine from the state of the actual world at some one time all its past and future states. We cannot agree with Rickert, then, that empirical reality tself sets im- passable limits to the natural-science Begriffsbildung. II. In the second part of his book, Rickert treats of the formation of his- torical concepts, understanding by history all those disciplines which seek, not to set up universal concepts, but to deal with reality itself. The problem of history is to form concepts with an individual content. It does not, like natural science, resolve all perceptual elements into abstract con- cepts and laws, but must constantly appeal to the reader's imagination. For logic, however, according to Rickert, this perceptual side of the histor- ical concept is of minor concern. But is not the perceptual side highly important in any sketch of a human character? And if so, can logic afford to neglect it ? Again, even granting the correctness of Rickert's account of the natural-science method, need everything that is not natural science belong to history? In making relation to a value the principle of indi-</page><page sequence="3">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 345 viduation, and hence of the formation of historical concepts, Rickert neglects those cases, e. g., organisms, in which the individuality depends primarily on the form of the object, independently of any valuing subject. His formal, absolute values have the twofold function of determining which individuals or objects require historical treatment, and of selecting those characteristics of the chosen object which are essential to its indi- viduality. But, in the first place, historical description must include other elements than those essential to the individuality of the object; it may even include most of the elements common to all objects of the same class, provided the scientific description of that class cannot be presupposed as familiar. If the fundamental structure and relations of a given object or person are to be described, elements must be taken into account which have no connection with absolute values. Secondly, even in determining which elements are important to the individuality of the object, value- relations play a very subordinate part. In the name of the object are implied those characteristics which it shares with others of its class; and by indicating further those characteristics wherein it differs from the normal type of the species, the historian may characterize its individuality as completely as his purpose requires. Where a series of objects is to be described, their unity may consist in their relation to an idea; this relation to an idea is not, however, like Rickert's value-relation, dependent on sub- jective feelings. If we call the idea a guiding historical concept (historscher Prinzifialbegrf'), the description consists in enriching the content of a general concept, e. g., man, by those characteristics which belong also to this more specific concept, e. g., African explorers. Permanent and objec- tive culture-systems, such as religion, art, science, etc., are especially suited to serve as guiding historical concepts; but the purposes or I values' involved in them are definite and concrete, not formal, and are found in the subject-matter of history itself, not read into it by the historian. In the physical world we find similar objective guiding concepts in the form of regressive causal series. For Rickert the historian's procedure is teleo- logical; but, according to his critic, values in Rickert' s sense are irrelevant. Thirdly, even in determining which individuals require historical treatment, the historian depends not on value-relations, but on objective culture- systems. His initial choice of a particular subject-matter is influenced, like that of the scientist in general, by personal (subjective) considerations; but after his choice is once made, he must describe his subject-matter, its development, its causes, and its relations to the culture-system to which it belongs, all in accordance with the perfectly objective principles of histor- ical method. The historical connection or whole does not depend on ideal relations to absolute values, but is given by the inexhaustibly rich historical process itself, in the concrete connections of the different culture- system s. F. D. MITCHELL.</page><page sequence="4">346 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. Kant und die gegenwdrtzige Aufgabe der Logik. FRITZ MEDICUS. Kant- Studien, XII, I, PP. 50-74. Kant, regarding logic as a purely formal science, saw no change therein since Aristotle, and had no conception of the problems which it ad- vances to-day. His Critique of Pure Reason is based on the proposition that the principles of formal logic are self-evident and form the basis of epistemological research. So he deduces his categories and arrives at his doctrine of the Ding-an-sich with its necessary dualism of consciousness and reality. With Fichte and Hegel,'both formal logic and the Ding-an- sich disappear, and we have instead dialectical development. Then the relation of the categories to one another, to the principles of Aristotelian logic, to Space and Time, to the dialectical problems of Kant, in short, to the whole theoretical philosophy, appears at once as one immense problem demanding an architectonic solution. This Hegel's Logic claims to be, as it broadens the sphere of reason and advances by dialectic to an all-compre- hensive system. Knowledge can never be complete; we proceed neces- sarily onward according to an endless process of development. Hegel's principal doctrine is the self-destruction of the finite categories and their passage into their opposite. This we grant but only within limitations. Hegel's method does not satisfy us completely to-day. Where do we now stand ? Truth is not found in the object, but in its meaning for consciousness. This is the first principle of logic, the meaning of the principle of identity, and upon it our philosophy is built. Belief in the truth is belief in the freedom of the theoretical I.' With this we judge finally every issue. With the positing of a INon-I ' comes the principle of contradiction, and then by abstraction from teleology, we reach the third principle, that of excluded middle. The great problem left to us is to find a principle upon which to establish the Ego in its relation to the finite, and this we do find in the synthetical unity of consciousness. Our conception of the problem of the categories, accordingly, is not entirely different from that of Kant, although not identical with his. But his philosophy must I die the death of the just,' when we realize that the problem of logic to-day is to explain the system of necessary thought forms by the idea of knowing. MARGARET K. STRONG. PSYCHOLOGY Sober Gefiuhksemt5findungen. C. STUMPF. Z. f. Psych., XLIV, I and 2, pp. 1-49. The sensory feelings (sinnliche Geffifhe) here under investigation com- prise physical pain, physical pleasure, and the pleasantness and unpleas- antness attaching to sensations from the higher senses. These sensory feelings may be regarded as attributes or aspects of sensation, as constitu- tive of a distinct order of elements, or as veritable sensations distinguishable by minor peculiarities only from other classes of sensations. The first</page><page sequence="5">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 347 position is manifestly untenable. An attribute which itself possesses attri- butes, and which may fall below the limen while the sensation to which it attaches remains supraliminal, is a dubious concept. As to the two remain- ing positions, the burden of proof must rest, according to the law of parsi- mony, with the former. Three considerations may be urged in its favor: (I) the relationship existing between sensory feeling and emotion; (2) the sub- jectivity of feeling as over against sensation; (3) the lack of spatial localization or extensity in feeling. None of these criteria proves valid; hence the view that sensory feelings represent a special class of sensations may be adopted. Of these sensory feelings, or affective sensations as they will henceforth be termed, cutaneous pain has been the first to yield to experimental investigation. Through the efforts of Goldscheider and von Frey,the isolation of pain and the demonstration of its purely sensational character have been effected. In the description of pain as a sensation quality, its attributes are exhausted. Pain is intrinsically painful, and all apparent deviations from this rule are cases of mixed pleasure and pain sensations, of dubious borderline phenomena, -. g., the painless prick,- or of predominating higher states (Affekte). A dichotomy similar to that of the temperature sense occurs in the sense of feeling. Over against the sensations of pain stand the sensations of pleasure. These sensations of pleasure and of pain may leave behind them memory images, as is made evident by the occurrence of hallucinations. Lack of ease of reproduction, while in itself prejudicial to the purely sensational character of feeling, is less to be urged against these peripherally conditioned affective sensations (pleasure and pain) than against certain others centrally conditioned and grouped under the term ' affective tone.' This so-called ' affective tone ' (pleasant or unpleasant) of the special sensations represents the second great class of affective sensations. While constituting an addendum to the sensation proper, it is an addendum which is in itself merely sensational, a centrally conditioned Mitem5flndung, as it were. The difficulties in the way of dissociated reproduction are hardly more considerable here than in the case of certain fusions in the sphere of taste, smell, etc. Unmo- tived reproduction is of course out of the question, but isolated representa- tion is not impossible. The visual representation of a musical sequence is sufficiently independent of all acoustic imagery to give rise to the appro- priate tonal feeling. The feeling transference here involved is obviously a case of abbreviated reproduction or association, hence a further point in favor of the sensational character of affective tone. The postulate of the dissimilarity of the affective quality attaching to different tones and colors contributes to the elucidation of the difficulties in the way of reproduction from a merely verbal clue. Finally, the peculiarities of reproduction are indicative less of the heterogeneous character of the affective elements, than of a special physiological condition at the centre. Hence no objec- tion against the classification of all modes of sensory feeling as veritable sensations (Sinnesem~findungen) obtains. The advantages accruing from</page><page sequence="6">348 TEE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. the reception of feeling elements into the already exploited sphere of sen- sation are manifest. The accumulated observations on the behavior of sensations and memory images become at once available in solution of the problems of analgesia, indifferent sensations, shifting of -feeling values, ir- regularities in correlation of sensation-quality and affective tone, individual and racial peculiarities, and genetic questions. ELSIE MURRAY. The Psychology of Organic Movement. I. M. BENTLEY. Am. J. Ps., XVII, 3, PP. 293-305. In any inquiry into the significance of the relation between mind and movement, various psychological problems are involved. Correspond- ing to differences in judgment regarding the origin and nature of the move- ments, general motor interpretations of various kinds have arisen. Two types of motor theory are noticeable: (I) those referring the character of the total consciousness to the interplay of motor mechanism, e. g., Ribot, and the central psychophysical theories; (2) those regarding the total con- sciousness as a primary factor in the motor adjustments of the organism. Among the many activity psychologies, the peculiarity of this one is its ' biologization' of consciousness. We meet again in I reactionism ' the use of organic movement, which was prominent in Bain and Ribot, not as specific content, but only as function. Another recent motor theory is that of Judd. This theory minimizes the part that kinesthetic sensations and images play in consciousness, and exalts the organizing function of a cen- trally situated ' motor' region. Whether interpreted as a general theory of conscious synthesis or as a special theory of space perception, this makes the rOle of organic movement less fundamental to consciousness than in Ribot and MUnsterberg. For functional psychology the motor problem has peculiar interest. The reactionist brings in his doctrine of attention, and this becomes the cardinal activity that constitutes both ' stimulus' and ' response'; but, in spite of the statements of Dewey and others, this is unintelligible to the writer. He closes by stating that no single 'motor problem' presses now for solution, but a variety of problems calling for discrimination of facts and theories. MARGARET K. STRONG. Des elements affectzfs de la concq5tion. C. Bos. Rev. Ph., XXXI, II, PP. 467-48 I. Consciousness presents two aspects, the representative and the affective. This article aims to explain by this dualism the controversy between the realists and the nominalists, and to show that their contradictory affirma- tions are due to the fact that mental processes occur differently in different individuals according to their temperament. The nominalist knows an object according to the intellectual or scientific mode, the realist according to the affective mode. Among- the Greeks the opposition of nominalism</page><page sequence="7">NOi 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 349 and realism find its expression in Protagoras, Antisthenes, and the Sophists, on the one hand, and in Plato and Plotinus, on the other, -in one case, in men of the cold, intellectual type, in the other, in men of a more emotional type. Nominalism, moreover, flourished in England among a people proverbially unemotional. A conciliation of these theories is found in the conceptualism of Abelard. To investigate affective images is highly difficult on account of their indefinite origin, their vague, inde- terminate nature, and the conditions under which the experiments must be made. Affective images, in mental life, act as a cement or an inter-rep- resentative fluid. An analogous phenomenon is seen in colored audition. Memory, like perception, may end in a transposition which sometimes leads us to a new image; the affective equivalents of the first visual images often are effaced yet survive translated into affective images. The affective element is not a concomitant but a constituting factor in the formation of the concept. The concept obtained by the affective mode of knowledge will be qualitatively different from the concept obtained by the pure, intel- lectual process. The consequence of this view is the opening up of a vast field for metaphysical speculation in regard to the nature of being. Inter- pretation according to the affective mode may some day cast a new light on systems of philosophy as yet imperfectly understood and unjustly depreciated. FRANK B. CRANDALL. HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY. Zzum T'erstindnis van Sfiinozas Ethik. W. M. FRANKL. A. f. G. Ph., XIX, 2, pp. 2I8-224. The object of this article is to direct attention to two antithetical elements in what the author calls the " natural history" of Spinoza' s system. These two elements are Spinoza's "reality-sense" (Wirklichkeitssinn) and his pan-intellectualism. The former is seen in his attempt to explain nature by means of itself (naturalism), in his descriptive rather than normative treat- ment of ethics, in his concretism, and in his view of the divergence between thought and reality (between the epistemologically simple and the existenti- ally simple, - a thing that is an unit for being may be a manifold for the understanding). Alongside of this conception of the divergence between thought and reality, we find in Spinozistic pan-intellectualism the antithet- ical view of the complete correspondence between thought and being. W. A. H. Kant's Antinomien und Zenons Beweise gegen die Bewegzung. R. SALIN- GER. A. f. G. Ph., XIX, I, Pp. 99-I22. Of the four antinomies which Kant develops in connection with his quadri- partite classification of the categories, Salinger omits from consideration here the antimony of causality and freedom, and the antimony of the world- creator, i. e., the antinomies of relation and modality. Only the first two</page><page sequence="8">350 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIZEW [VOL. XVI, (methodological) antinomies are in point for S.'s discussion. The funda- mental error in Kant's argumentation lies in'the confusion betWeen two totally distinct conceptions of the infinite, viz., the potentially endless or infinite sinefinefinitum and the actually infinite or transfinite. The former, refers to the limitless possibility of endless progression or division, the latter to the fiction of a complete infinity. In basing his thesis on the latter (transfinite) and his antithesis on the former (endlessly divisible infinite) conception, Kant commits the fallacy of quaternio terminorum. In considering the Zenonic proofs for the illusion of motion and plurality, S. excludes the first proof (the ' Stadium ') as palpably sophistic. The other three proofs, viz., ' Achilles,' the ' Dichotofry,' and the ' Flying Arrow,' he reviews in detail, and cites the classical criticisms of ancient and modern historians of philosophy - Aristotle, Bayle, Leibniz, Hamilton, Renouvier, Tannery, et al. The basic problem in the antinomies of Kant and in thd 'proofs of Zeno is the problem of the continuum. Continuity quite as much as endlessness is a notion of possibility, not of actuality. Continuity and in- finity are both postulates of conceptual thought, not facts of empirical thought. Consciousness can represent to itself successively distinct mag- nitudes, but not strictly a flowing continuum of magnitudes. It is in this limitation of thought that S. sees the heart of the Zenonic difficulty. W. A. H. Philolaus. W. R. NEWBOLD. A. f. G. Ph., XIX, 2, pp. I76-2I7. N. is concerned here mainly with the interpretation of two passages in the Philolaic fragments, which Boeckh and his successors have left unin- telligible. The first refers to the function of number as 'embodying' and 'splitting' ratios and the meaning of the, gnomon ; the second is concerned with the principles of 'rEpatvovra and 47retpa. The -writer ex-i plains that the use of number supplants the old gnomon in making things "I knowable to perception and comparable one with another in the manner of the gnomon," i. e., in order to compute various areas or quanta represented by areas, it is no longer necessary to employ the gnomon in their reduction to parallelograms having a common side. For by the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers, areas may be measured directly and the relations between numbers be made to faithfully represent the relations between figures. The arithmetical method of computing the quantitative attributes of figures and areas suc- ceeds the cumbersome geometrical or gnomon method. In the matter of embodying and splitting ratios, N. conjectures that some such word as &amp;vv a-rrrov be read instead of Boeckh' s emendation awuarav. He takes a&lt;x&amp;iv to mean here ' factoring.' He would therefore make the passage mean "'compounding and factoring ratios," i.- e., number not only makes qudnia directly comparable one with another, but is the instrument whereby 'ratios' may be multiplied and factored. N. thinks that spya may have the common early meaning of ' cultivated fields,' and &amp;weipa and irepaivoVTa</page><page sequence="9">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 35!L would then refer to indeterminate and determinate patches or field-shapes. This conception of determinants as similar plane figures would explain the reference to ipya. N. further explains the early Pythagorean application of geometrical figures to the problems of astronomy and its survival in as- trology, while the later arithmetical use of degrees, minutes, and seconds rendered the earlier method obsolete. Analogous to the way in which arithmetic superseded geometry amongst the Pythagoreans, is Descartes's translation of many mathematical truths into algebraic terms, that were earlier expressed geometrically. Philolaus had probably inherited from the earlier Pythagoreans the geometrical method of analyzing the universe into a limited number of similar figures, but this method broke down in appli- cation to the dbretpa, the residuum of the qretpaivovra, and to such abstractions as temperance, justice, etc., which had to be brought into the Harmonia, and to these the numerical interpretation was applied by identifying them with certain numbers to which they had resemblance. W. A. H. Mechanismus und TeZeologie zn der Philosohhie Lo/zes. K. WEIDEL. A. f. G. Ph., XIX, I, pp. 1-98. The first part of this article contains a formulation of the views of Lotze regarding mechanism and teleology, and is followed by a second part in which W. subjects these views to a critical examination. The outline of thediscussion is as follows: I. Exposition: (I) the nature of mechanism; (2) the sphere to which mechanism is applicable; (3) the mechanical world- view; (4) the teleological world-view; (5) the freedom of the will. II. Criticism. (I) mechanism; (2) phenomena of life; (3) teleology. After stating the theories of Lotze under the above-mentioned rubrics, W. ex- amines the scope and significance of the principle of mechanism. On the foundation of the most throughgoing application of the principle of me- chanism to the physical world, Lotze erects the superstructure of a teleo. logical-religious metaphysics. Within the physical world, including biolog- ical phenomena, every event is necessarily conditioned by the causal in- teraction of physical forces. In causality and identity, on the one hand, and classification and specification, on the other hand, we have formal principles of absolute validity. By means of these we comprehend the world, for comprehension is the reference of a phenomenon to its causes and to its position in a complex, in which it has a definite place. In the world there is nothing causeless, sui generis, accidental, unrelated. But in the philosophy of Lotze, physical and psychical phenomena form two causally isolated worlds, in the former of which every event is referable only to physical causes, and in the latter every event is referable only to psychical causes. The consequence of the view would be a parallelism between the physical and psychical, which is due to the fact that Lotze took over from the old psychology the doctrine of the substantiality of the soul, instead of regarding the soul as consisting merely in psychical proc-</page><page sequence="10">352 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XV1. esses. He expresses here a view which in biology he had vehemently tombated (vitalism or life-substance). Further, he is forced by this view to deny the doctrine of the conservation of energy. For a molecular motion in the brain can set up only another physical motion; when an equivalent arises in a world not causally related 'with the physical, viz., in the world of psychical events, the physical energy simply vanishes without trace with- in the physical world. The causal series at this point is broken. The converse of this would be true of a conative process. So, too, in regard to the freedom of the will, Lotze, while admitting that determinism cannot be scientifically disproved, concedes that freedom is a matter of faith, to which, however, we are forced by the consciousness of choice and the judg- inent of merit and guilt, and herein he further denies the universality of the causal nexus in the psychical series. W. points out that every act of the will is determined by the antecedent causal series within the character, and explains in detail the illusion of the freedom of choice. According to Lotze three presuppositions are necessary in order to make the mechanical explanation of the world intelligible: (I) The existence of a world of concrete, definitely differentiated reals; (2) the existence of definite, universal laws,as eternally valid formula for the interaction of these concrete reals; (3) the existence of an exactly determinate order and position of these reals at every point in the past, also at the arbitrarily fancied begin- ning point in the cosmic development. These presuppositions of a mechan- ical explanation of the world's development involve the acceptance of teleological world-bases. Lotze's further speculations, by which he seeks to establish a monism, move in a sphere outside the limits of experience and therefore outside the limits of the scientifically demonstrable. His at- tempt is shipwrecked on the logical irreconcilability of the infinite many and the absolute one, atomism and pantheism, and his monistic standpoint sheers over into dualism. His conception of a world-plan is a piece of anthropomorphism. His metaphysical speculation is an external, unten- able union of mechanical physical fatalism with teleological ideas, but not a reconciliation. Such a reconciliation is discoverable only in an idealistic interpretation of the physical world. W. A. H. The Concej5tion of the Unknown in English Philosothy. T. M. FORSYTH. Mind, No. 6i, pp. 10I-II7. English philosophy has persistently insisted that experience is the true basis for philosophical thought. Concomitant with this emphasis, there has been a conception of an unknown sphere beyond the limits of experience. As the various theories have refined upon the essential nature of experience (the known), a corresponding advance in the conception of the unknown beyond the limits of experience has inevitably taken place. The present paper is an attempt to follow the latter development, and to indicate its connection with the former. The view of experience that forms the basis of the empirical school is that of a set of discrete data; knowledge arises</page><page sequence="11">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 353 from the contact between mind and matter, each of which exists independ- ently of and prior to experience. The logical outcome of such a concep- tion of experience is absolute skepticism with reference to the ultimate validity of knowledge, since the realm of the knowable is restricted to ideas alone. In reaction against this Lockean development, the ' common sense' philosophy of Reid and Hamilton rehabilitates the objectivity of knowledge, but at the expense of reasserting the antithesis of mind and matter as fac- tors in its production. This dualism the Scottish philosophers never tran- scend, though they are not entirely consistent with themselves. Again we are landed in scepticism; but, instead of one unknowable reality, as with Hume, we now have two on our hands. The resuscitation of the empirical standpoint in Brown and Mill is interesting chiefly because it emphasizes the futility of attempting to base an epistemology on such presuppositions. Spencer corrects Hamilton's impossible conception of an unconditional existence known only negatively; but he himself inconsistently posits an unknowable beyond the realm of the known, thus asserting an existence which has no relation to knowledge. Against this conception of an un- knowable existence, Ferrier is the first in English philosophy to formulate an argument. Such a conception, he maintains, is a nonentity, and in this position he agrees with the thinkers of to-day; the only unknowable is the unintelligible, which does not really exist. Reality may be unknown, but not unknowable. G. W. CUNNINGHAM.</page></plain_text>
