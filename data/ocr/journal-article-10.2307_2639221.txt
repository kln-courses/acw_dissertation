Religion is the belief in gods that some hold false, behaviour or practice others consider contrary to reason, but that provides a bond (religio) among its votaries. So, religion and superstition are two sides of the same coin - at least in the nineteenth-century France with which the books under review occupy themselves. The eighteenth century opened the way to heterodoxy, but only for a minority, most of whom knew or learned the virtues of discretion. But the Revolution sent the church tumbling and, with it, the public disciplines and restraints which kept superstition - that is, nonconformity to official religion - in its place: in the shadows. After I 8o i, even after i814, Catholicism was no more than the religion of a majority of the French, the church that once enforced it represented one opinion among others. More overtly than ever, at least within living memory, piety took many forms. Chateaubriand had warned that witches' lairs would open when the temples of the Lord were closed. But witches had been around for a long time; and when the temples of the Lord reopened, sorcerers and soothsayers were still around to challenge their offerings, their prophecies and ceremonies. Never, it seems, at least in modern times, were religion and superstition more active in France than during the heyday of irreligion and anti- clericalism. Betting on horses that have won, accounts of the age emphasize irreligion and its struggle against traditional beliefs, but pay less heed to widespread religious preoccupations, let alone persistence. We acknowledge the nineteenth century's fascination with religion, from piety to faddishness, but minimize the relevance of an obsessive religious quest. Even historians of mentalite's, myself included, have tended to play down less obvious linkages between broader religious activities, culture and politics. The late-eighteenth-century revival of millenarian beliefs, and the conjunction of millenarianism and mundane politics, offer a good example of the sort of thing we know but gloze. The Revolution of 1789, and even more its brood, had been about changing mankind and altering human nature. Even when it foundered, revolutionary experience suggested a radical transformation in progress, and changes of cosmic significance just around the corner. Apocalyptic speculation was reinforced by circumstance. E. P. Thompson has referred to the chiliasm of despair. There was also, of course, a chiliasm of hope: specific or diffuse, present terror bred hope of future regeneration. Even the persecution of the church suggested the coming of the Joachimite third age. Fourscore years ago, Albert Mathiez described such messianic 399</page><page sequence="2">400 HISTORICAL JOURNAL expectations of a new Jerusalem: the vision 'of an age of gold placed in the future and no longer in the past'.' The conjunction of revolution and chiliasm was crucial. In a work published in I 975, Clarke Garrett made the point that revolutionaries and millenarians both affirmed the possibility that heaven could be built on earth. Nor were the two currents clearly divided, either from each other or from Christian thought. There were those for whom accomplishing the political revolution advanced the realization of divine will. Garrett devotes a chapter to Suzette Labrousse, a holy woman and prophetess from Vanxains,2 near Riberac in Perigord, for whom the Revolution ushered in God's regeneration of the world, and who unsuccessfully tried to get the pope to collaborate with the divine design. The Constitutional bishop of Dordogne, meanwhile, edited a Journal propketique, 'dedicated to showing that the Revolution was the herald of the millennium',3 sometimes in very practical ways that remind one of Fourier: the weather would improve, the land bear richer fruit... Only the seas of lemonade are missing. The church soon jettisoned such encumbrances. Some anticlericals stuck with them. Those whom Frank Kermode nicely described as religious anti-clericals could not do without them. Hence the apparent paradox that makes early socialists religious (or superstitious), often in a millenarian vein. Explorers of literary marginalia are acquainted with the strong current of romantic mysticism that ran through Restoration to July Monarchy, drawing its sources in Swedenborg and Saint Martin, Mme Guyon and Mme de Kruidener, to Lamennais, Esquiros, Buchez, Quinet, Alphonse-Louis Constant, and developing fashionable themes of eschatological thought: a new last age, the end of days, the cult of woman as redeemer, Christ - no longer the Revolution's sans-culotte de Nazareth, nevertheless a harbinger of social salvation. This is the inspiration of a wordy, pretentious, excruciatingly bad book by Philippe Muray, somewhat reminiscent of James Webb's Flight from reason. Serious students would do better to shun Murray and turn to Auguste Viatte's classic, Sources occultes du Romantisme, or to his more accessible Hugo et les illumines de son temps.4 Yet, beneath Muray's verbiage, a lean article struggles to escape. Its argument: that the occult was unavowed progressivism, socialism a form of occultism that prefers not to think about its origins (or foundation myth, or basic nature). The common factor of socialism and the occult is magic, in the sense that Flaubert had in mind when he pointed out that magic believes in immediate change by virtue of the formulas it employs, exactly like socialism. Thus a metaphor becomes an argument, and Muray insists: 'sans l'occultisme il n'y aurait peut-etre pas eu de triomphe si complet des socialismes'.5 The thesis is interesting, though Muray claims undue priority in its formulation. 'Socialisme et occultisme. Une question jamais posee. 6 The subtitle of Nerval's Les Illumines: Les precurseurs du socialisme, which Muray himself quotes without the publication date, I852, suggests that the idea had occurred before. Garrett raises it too.

Garrett has 'resisted the temptation to look for secret or unconscious millenarians among the principal actors of the French Revolution'.' If only Muray had resisted as stoutly. Instead, he yields to every far-fetched suggestion. Robespierre is Messiah, Jacobins refer to him as Saviour, his admirers liken him to God, 'his icon hangs in cottages'8 - a dubious assertion before the advent of cheap prints, but reminiscent of Che Guevara in Bolivia. Contemporary gossip does not make a case. Guilt by allegation becomes proof by association when Muray trots out Catherine Theot, an aged prophetess consulted and adulated by a few disciples, attractive to nosy neighbours, mondains interested in eccentrics, and police spies. For Muray, Robespierre's involvement with Theot (alleged and dismissed in the Convention just before Thermidor) raises no doubt: 'Royalists, magn6tiseurs, Jacobins, everyone comes to see her. ' Naturally, Robespierre had his special armchair reserved by her side. A look at Garrett's chapter on Theot explodes the mummery. No mesmerism, no magnetism, no Robespierre; some royalists (but not as royalists), and Jacobins - mostly to observe and denounce the prayer meetings conducted by Theot. This places in perspective Muray's description of his book which, he tells us, offers 'une histoire du i ge siecle litteraire avec une periodisation rigoureuse [actually, a capricious farrago], une approche de la question-charniere de la transformation des religions du passe en croyance universelle social-occulte [diverse affirmation with no documentation], un roman enfin, une sorte de roman'.'0 This last is true. And, though the historical novel seems long, it presents the times and their literary and political personalities in an unaccustomed light, stressing a side of them that we knew but to which we have not given much thought. Muray reminds us how strong the millennial, chiliastic, eschatological currents were in early and mid- nineteenth century France, how pervasive interest in the occult, how permeated progressive political and literary milieux were by them. 'Quelque part que l'on marche, on met le pied sur un messie.' For the swarm of illumine's, Emmanuel Swedenborg was one of the patron saints. Dead since I 772, he had left behind the vision of our universe as a forest of symbols, Baudelaire's 'temple ou des vivants pilliers/Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles'. He had done more: he had travelled among the planets, had seen the dead, had plumbed the world of spirits and attended the last judgement. In his wake, Swedenborg's disciples would seek the key to the secrets of the universe, the host of obscure oracles announcing a new era and the coming of a 'social' religion. When Swedenborg affected so many, Muray has to pick on Fourier, on whom Swedenborg's influence is doubtful. But Muray likes chains of influence: Swedenborg influences Fourier who influences Flora Tristan who quotes both in support of her feminism. 12 But Fourier would have been irritated to see his system of analogies attributed to Swedenborg, and Tristan appreciated Fourier not for his esotericism but for his social phantasies and, above all, for his stout championship of women. For Muray, feminism is connected with suspect inclinations towards vegetarianism, theosophy and pacifism.'3 It was certainly a rather eccentric notion, yet not so strange 7 Garrett, Respectablefolly, p.

A number of the nineteenth century's utopian prophets shared it. Fourier, Comte, Prosper Enfantin believed in the liberty, equality, in certain ways the superiority, of women. The image of the suffering woman, especially the suffering mother (the virgin mother best of all, symbol of salvation for the Christian soul), could easily turn into a promise of worldly redemption, a vision of woman as instrument of social progress. Ill-married or prostituted, deprived of legal and intellectual rights, condemned to procreate in pain, woman is crucified as the Christ was crucified and shares his redeeming role. Swedenborg had spoken of a hidden key to the secrets of life. Mary or Magdalen, woman holds the key to a new mankind, and that key is suffering charity, loving suffering. Better still, in the abbe Constant's Derniere Incarnation (I846), Christ returns to Paris to preach socialism, and he holds out the vision of a fusion of the sexes in an androgynous socialist realm where men and women will be no more, only strength and tenderness, grace and energy, integrated in one being. In this context, one appealing figure deserves to be drawn from the shadows, to whom Muray alludes very much en passant: Ganneau, sculptor by trade and founder, in the I 840s, of a philosophical religion that insisted on equality of the sexes and sought to fuse the male and female principles into one. The religion's name, evadisme, fused Eve and Adam; and Ganneau's title as high priest, Mapah, was a conflation of MAter and PAter. Evadisme foundered in I848, leaving behind a few pamphlets now in the Bibliotheque Nationale, and some traces in the mind of men it briefly attracted, like Jules Verne's editor, Hetzel, and the future communard destined to die a deputy of the Third Republic: Felix Pyat. Muray does not mention evadisme, nor does he make clear just who the Mapah was. He is too fascinated by the absurd aspect of such cults to notice how easily the transition could be made from a socialist union of the sexes to a socialist union of classes, how naturally one image of suffering redeemers could be substituted for another. As it would be. Yet, if feminism was a good deal more than queer cultishness, a propensity to cultishness does mark the times. Muray reminds us (he is not the first) how many nineteenth-century reformers dabbled in the esoteric, if not in the occult. Saint-Simon for one, who ended by proposing a New Christianity (I825). Olinde Rodriguez, Alphonse Esquiros and Prosper Enfantin, heirs of Saint-Simon, helped make philosophy 'a suburb of the occult'.14 Even Auguste Blanqui, before his death, committed L'Eternite par les astres (I872). Emancipated from formal religious observance, new believers sought new systems to replace the old, adopted the language of the old to present the new. One day, Esquiros and his friend Adolphe Constant went to see the Mapah. They had gone to scoff, they stayed to pray: 'Having heard him we thought it would be beautiful if we could find the last word of the revolution and tell it to the world. '5 Esquiros exalts the great revolutionaries in L'Evangile du peuple (i841), he becomes a representative of the people in I848 and publishes his socialist vision of the future: spiritualization of matter, purification by suffering, reincarnation on earth, then among the stars.16 Constant, once trained for the priesthood, shifts from admiration for Christ as the great reaper 'armed with a scythe', to new models: StJohn, 'the songster of the Apocalyptic revolution', Lucifer, angel of light and principle of Liberty 14 Ibid. p. 2II. 15 Eliphas Levi, Histoire de la magie (Paris, i86o), pp. 522 if. 16 De la vie future au point de vue socialiste (Marseille, I850).</page><page sequence="5">HISTORIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW 403 reconciled to Christ by Mary."7 The occult sciences would show the way. Adolphe Constant, having become Eliphas Levi foretells the marriage of Christianity and socialism, as a preliminary to the millennium. Most of the figures cited so far could be dismissed as marginal. Less so George Sand, whom Renan once described, not unfairly, as the aeolian harp of her time, vibrating to every intellectual and political breeze. For Muray, Sand is a 'joachimite-socialist' and for once he is not awry. Invited to become the female Messiah of Saint- Simonianism, Sand declined. But her good friend Pierre Leroux, a democratic Christian in the illuministic vein, was keen on the Revelation ofJohn and on the other revelations attributed to Joachim of Flora, whose idea of an elite charged with the conversion of the world at the dawn of a new age of Holy Spirit and brotherly love attracted much sympathetic attention. It was under Leroux's influence that Sand wrote Spiridion (i839), whose hero, Angel, saves from his pious mentor's tomb the manuscript revelation of a new religion, compound of Lamennais and Pierre Leroux. Socialist, occultist, Spiridion - revised, clarified and further Joachimified in i842 - fascinated Renan and pleased Michelet and Quinet, for whom the gospel of Joachim of Flora spoke to the heart and mind, when that of the church spoke only to the letter. Paranormal phenomena were related. Swedenborg's world of spirits and symbols permeated by divine light, Mesmer's transmission of universal forces through a subtle invisible fluid, spiritualist belief that departed souls communicate with mortals, all fumbled for a hidden key to the secrets of life, and death. Muray has a lot to say about animal magnetism: a subject which Robert Darnton treated with greater elegance (and economy) in his Mesmerism (i 968). Muray may not have read Darnton (it is not clear just what he did read) but he elaborates Darnton's point. Magnetism appeared an alternative science, just as promising but more accessible, and more immediately exciting. Balzac, Hugo, Theophile Gautier shared the fashionable belief in invisible fluids that carried the forces of life. Flaubert's Bouvard et Picuchet turned their attention to it, and his Dictionnaire des idies re,ues ridiculed it along with other contemporary absurdities. But it was not easy to dismiss it. Magnetism was evoked from the pulpit of Notre-Dame, prestigious men of science were intrigued by the potential extension of mere natural science: among them Camille Flammarion, the astronomer, Cesare Lombroso (professor of psychiatry at Pavia), who busied himself raising the dead, and Edison, alleged to have developed a telegraph system for speaking with the dead. Better known is the case of the James brothers, William and Henry, whose father had been fascinated by Swedenborg and Fourier, of Conan Doyle, and of other literary figures like Nerval and Sainte-Beuve.18 The occult sciences (a term Eliphas Levi first used in I856) were defined by Dr Joseph Grasset, a Montpellier neurologist: 'those facts which do not yet belong to science [but] can one day be part of it'. Nothing supernatural, as Victor Hugo put it who turned to turning tables after the drowning of his daughter Leopoldine - just the occult continuation of infinite nature.1 At the century's closing, still, an apology of spiritualism begins with the affirmation that spiritualism is a science, 'indeed the science', and predicts that 'we shall soon manage to photograph thought, the psyche, 17 See Viatte, Victor Hugo, pp. 92 if. and Constant, La Mere de Dieu (Paris, I844). 18 Muray, ige siecle, pp. 199, i8o-i. 19 Grasset, L'Occultisme hier et aujourd 'hui, le merveilleux priscientifique (Montpellier, 1907) quoted in Muray, i9e siecle, p. 157; Hugo, Les Travailleurs de la mer (Paris, i866), p. 40.</page><page sequence="6">404 HISTORICAL JOURNAL the peirisprit'.20 Having discarded religious miracles, the enlightened turned to the miracles of science. Occult forces were a convenient resource for those who sought to explain phenomena others considered supernatural. We are not surprised to hear from Muray that, in I848, Le Journal du magne'tisme took the side of revolution. Or to find the future Eliphas Levi, seconded by his fiery young wife, presiding at a Club de la Montagne where he declares: 'Nous ferons bouillir le sang des aristos dans les chaudieres de la Revolution et nous en ferons du boudin pour rassasier les proletaires affam6s. '2 Muray omits this scene, though it brings grist to the mill of an occultist-socialist conjunction. Nor does he mention that a disciple of the Mapah, Sobrier, had fired the first shot of -the February revolution.22 But I848 secreted other revolutionary forces. In March that year, in upper New York State, the Fox family discovered the possibility of communicating with the world of spirits. Spiritualism, table-turning, rapping, automatic writing, ectoplasm, eventually telepathy, a flood of messages flowed in upon the century, and many mediums were recruited among veterans of I848 or victims of Bonapartist repression. The greatest spiritualist of the time, Allan Kardec, founder of the Revue spirite, seems to have shared their turn of mind. The relation of occultism and politics (especially left-wing politics), however tenuous, was going to feed the belief, current in Catholic circles, that the church's political enemies were in league with Satan. Figuratively, revolutionaries who disestablished the church, persecuted the pope, executed the king, were clearly suppots de Satan. Their affinities were revealed when the Estates General associated the Left (hitherto linked to negativity and evil) with progress and other allegedly beneficial forces. The connexion was further confirmed as many Romantics presented fallen angels as heroic, promethean or, at least, sympathetic. Proud rebels, first to revolt against the established order, first to struggle against unjust authority, first victims of oppression for having dreamt of better things. For the Restoration, Liberty was diabolic. For the partisans of revolution Satan, angel of revolt, was also Lucifer, the carrier of light. For some of its foes, democracy looked like demonocracy; and the religious wars that ravaged nineteenth-century France reinforced that impression. Soon, masonic dens of republicanism and anticlericalism became temples of Satan. Quite literally so for many ecclesiastics and for Rome, in thefin de siecle revelations of Leo Taxil. In I 895, having disclosed the iniquities of the church, Taxil turned coat to tell the dreadful tale of the devil's personal manipulation of masonic politics from headquarters sited under the rock of Gibraltar and in Charleston, South Carolina. The church knew he spoke true. For those who worshipped Satan, 'King of the disinherited', God was a tyrant and usurper.23 Curiously, the enemies of the Left, who had never been backward in their own recourse to the supernatural, were as embroiled with the occult as their foes are alleged to be. Not so curious, really, if we follow Muray for whom occultism, socialism and antisemitism go together, for mid-century mages like Eliphas Levi as for more up-to- date figures like Drumont, of the Libre Parole, and his acolyte Gaston M6ry.24 Since (at least in one of its aspects) antisemitism was an offshoot of socialism, since Jews were not 20 J.

Their relation to the end of time was also predestined, at least for those of millenarian bent like Drumont and Leon Bloy, but also for the Assumptionist Father Bailly, editor of La Croix, for whom antisemitism necessarily preceded the conversion of the Jews, after which would come the end of time.25 On prend son bien ou on le trouve. Unregenerate Jews stubbornly refusing to help the millennium along are a problem, of course; but the sources offin de siecle antisemitism are so manifold that Muray sagely does not insist. Less wisely, he has nothing to say about thefin de siecle epidemic of magic and satanism. Since much of this was related to reaction in literature (Josephin Peladan, J.-K. Huysmans) or in politics (Drumont), and inspired by references to attempts by a reactionary occultist, Eugene Vintras, Muray's discretion is under- standable.26 Reactionary occultism ill fits his original argument. Yet the persistence of occultism and its appearance on all sides of the political spectrum suggest the widespread influence of what we too easily dismiss as simply silly. So do its recurrent themes: regeneration, social and individual; science and proto-science; conspiracy or counter-conspiracy; activities and forces acting below the surface, invisible to the uninitiated but fundamental to understanding and control of an increasingly opaque world. II For Muray, one example of the century's obsession with the supernatural was what he describes as 'le typhon de marisme' that broke upon it - mariolatry as part of the messianic-feminist explosion he traces elsewhere.27 Apparitions of the Virgin Mary were hardly confined to the nineteenth century, let alone to France. But for the purpose of this review we can turn to two illuminating studies that touch upon them: the older by Thomas Kselman, Miracles and prophecies in nineteenth-century France (i983), and Michael Carroll's more recent Cult of the Virgin Mary (i 986). Both deal with some of the major apparitions of the Virgin: at Paris in I830, at La Salette in i846, at Lourdes in I858, at Pontmain in I870. Kselman emphasizes economic, social and political analysis. Carroll favours the psychoanalytic approach. Each, it seems to me, makes a suggestive contribution to the historical and human understanding of events, and their books can be usefully read together. But neither exhausts the possibilities of historical interpretation, in which private experience acquires meaning in social context, and general considerations are illumined by specific conditions. Without any more pretension at exhaustiveness than Kselman or Carroll exhibit, I want to suggest some factors that deserve more attention than either provides. On the night of i8July I830, Catherine Laboure, a 24-year-old novice of the Sisters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul in Paris, was awakened by her guardian angel who led her to the convent chapel, where the Virgin Mary talked to her about the dangers that would soon befall France. The Virgin appeared again to Catherine on 27 25 Thomas Kselman, Miracles and prophecies in nineteenth-century Franice (New Brunswick, I983), pp. 138-9. 26 See Jules Bois, Le Satanisme et la magie (Paris, I895); Arthur Edward Waite, Devil-worship in France or the question of Lucifer (London, I896) ;Joanny Bricaud, .-K.

The first 1500 medals were delivered in June i832. According to Gerard Cholvy and Yves-Marie Hilaire, in less than four years over eight million medals would be struck, by i842 about a hundred million. Carroll discusses Catherine's 'hallucination' in the context of Catherine's double loss, first of her mother, then of the mother's sister who had raised her. He also tells us that she went to bed on I8 July 'in a state of great emotional intensity'. The following day was the feast day of St Vincent de Paul, and on the i8th each sister had been given a morsel of the surplice once worn by St Vincent. 'Catherine tore hers in two and swallowed one of the halves.'28 Carroll does not remark how Catherine's action reproduced an age-old preservation rite, followed by Christians since the Middle Ages and maintained in religious and magic ritual since. More important, it seems to me, he fails to place events in their historical context. July I830 saw the culmination of a constitutional crisis that came to a head in the revolution of 27, 28 and 29 July that toppled Charles X. The last legislative elections of the Restoration began on the i3th and ended on Igth July. Feelings against the church, associated with the policy of reaction, were running high. During the Trois Glorieuses, the archbishop's palace would be sacked, the sacristies of Notre Dame desecrated, Jesuit headquarters at Montrouge attacked. Churches had to close for a few days till passions abated, priests no longer dared show themselves in the street wearing ecclesiastical garb, while the archbishop of Paris, Mgr Quelen, denounced as a public enemy, went briefly into hiding. Stress and crisis continued through the summer. After much uncertainty, November 1830 (the month of Catherine's next vision) saw the installation of a new government; but the climate of insecurity persisted. France was boiling over with revolt and the church was in dire straits. In February I83 I serious riots broke out around the church of St Germain l'Auxerrois, culminating in the sack of that church and that of the archbishopric itself. Between November I830 and January I83I the Virgin had appeared to Catherine a number of times before Catherine's confessor was sufficiently impressed to petition the archbishop to authorize the minting of her medal: a request presumably discussed, perhaps even received, after the archbishopric had been sacked for a second time in eight months. The medals were being struck just when the cholera hit Paris. Prime Minister Casimir-Perier died of the cholera in May I832, the first medals were delivered in June I832, and their phenomenal success cannot be separated from their use as images of preservation, any more than Catherine's emotional state can be separated from the echoes of current events that reached her convent in the rue du Bac.29 From Paris, we move on fourteen years to the apparition of the Virgin to two shepherd children in the wild mountains of Isere, near La Salette. Kselman relates the Virgin's apocalyptic statements to the economic crisis of 1846.30 Carroll, arguing from 28 Michael P. Carroll, The Cult of the Virgin Mary. Psychological origins (Princeton, I986) p. 170. 29 See Gerard Cholvy and Yves-Marie Hilaire, Histoire religieuse de la France contemporaine (2 vols., Toulouse, I 985-6), I, 280. One might add that a fervent believer like Catherine, plausibly affected by the feast of St Vincent on I9 July, could be equally impressed by sermons and ceremonies related to a whole series of feasts concerning the Virgin: 2 July, Visitation; I8 August, Assumption; 8 September, Nativity; 7 October, Rosary; 2I November, Presentation. Six out of eight annual fetes of the Virgin Mary fell between her first and last visions. 25 November, two days before the Virgin's crucial command, was the feast of Catherine's own patron saint, St Catherine of Alexandria. 30 Kselman, Miracles, pp. 62-6.</page><page sequence="9">HISTORIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW 407 the shepherd boy's possible [mis]interpretation of something she said, thinks that the boy's 'hallucination' 'was an attempt to gratify an unconscious wish to harm his stepmother, which derived from the intense hostility he felt as a result of the abuse he had suffered at her hands'.31 Neither view is implausible. On the one hand, economic conditions in I846 were pretty terrible. On the other, many fairy tales reflect the sufferings of orphaned stepchildren and the fantasy retributions they long to inflict.32 Some forge fairy tales, others hallucinate. But there is, surely, more to the situation.33 The Lady who appeared at La Salette was crying - perhaps, as the shepherd boy thought, because she had been beaten as he might have wished to beat his wicked stepmother. But the message she delivered was that of a perefouettard, not very different from the sort of sermon the children could have heard in church: God's name is being taken in vain, Sunday is not observed as a day of rest, only old women go to church, there is dancing on Sundays and eating of meat in Lent, the young make a mockery of religion and throw stones at girls who go to church. No wonder there is dearth, and there will be worse to come if folk don't mend their ways. Carroll and Kselman do not delve into local detail. If we look into that, we find that, at La Salette as in other villages, tensions between parish and priest ran high. The priest was 64, an advanced age for those days, and accused of drivelling in the pulpit. We do not know what the drivel was, but at Corps, a few miles away, in whose jurisdiction La Salette lay, we know that indifference to clerical injunctions was rife, Sunday attendance low, dancing 'scandalous', the faithful worked on Sundays, did not keep church feasts, insulted the priest, blasphemed, behaved badly in church when they went there. They were admonished about it. It is not unreasonable to think their next-door neighbours were too, and that much of the Virgin's language echoed the admonitions of local priests.34 The swift devotional reaction of the undevout population round La Salette could have been accelerated by the terrible economic conditions of that winter. But it could also be seen as an affirmation of local originality against Corps next door, and of local autonomy over the routine injunctions of official authority. While the sympathetic hearing the children received from the clerical authorities (contrasting with the caution shown in Paris and in Lourdes) reflects appreciation of an opportunity to take difficult populations in hand and advance their re-Christianization. Now we move on again, to the West of France. In January I 87 I the Franco-Prussian War was drawing to a miserable end. On i 8 January the king of Prussia had been crowned German emperor at Versailles. An Armistice would be signed on 28 January, when the siege of Paris ended in capitulation. Since October 1870, the shock of French defeats had spawned holy missionaries and visionaries carrying a message of hope among Catholics and royalists. In the West, desultory fighting continued, as German troops pursued the French broken at the battle of Le Mans. That was the situation when, on the night of Tuesday I 7 January, the Virgin rose like a star above a cottage in the little village of Pontmain. Her message was a message of hope: prayer would bring delivery and fulfilment of entreaties. Pontmain was not 3' Carroll, The Cult, p. 154. 32 See Eugen Weber, 'Fairies and hard facts: the reality of folk tales', Journal of the History of Ideas (January 198I). 3 At La Salette, too, a feast of the Virgin, her Nativity, had been celebrated ten days before her apparition. 3 See Jean Stern, La Salette.

An 'illusion', therefore, prompted by a conjunction of anxieties, and specially by fear for the safety of a beloved brother.35 Why not? But why not more? Pontmain lies in fervently White, fervently Catholic country. Charrette's white flag embroidered with the Sacred Heart had flown over his Breton volunteers facing the Germans only weeks before. Pontmain is spiritually in the Vendee, a few miles from the Breton border, in Maine. St-Ouen-des-Toits, the parish where Jean Chouan's revolt began in August I 792, is only twenty miles away. Fougeres and its forest, bastions of chouannerie, lie fifteen miles across the Breton border. Jeanne Leroyer (I730-98), in religion Sccur Nativite, spent a holy life full of visions in the Franciscan convent at Fougeres; and her revelation, published in I8I8, identified the Revolution with the reign of Antichrist.36 At Pontmain, war would look much like a holy war, a village scarcely threatened by the enemy would have a greater number of its sons in danger and its sentiments more deeply engaged than one might expect to find in the largely indifferent countryside.37 Further consideration reminds us that this is a region fertile in visions and cults. Michelet in La Sorciere places the witches' favourite haunting-grounds in marches (border areas), landes (moors), dark forests, briar and brush, deserts (wastes) and, above all, nos marches de l'Ouest.38 Pontmain fulfils his conditions. As at La Salette (and to a lesser degree Lourdes), the place-names around it suggest poor land: bracken and brush, wolves, untilled land, moors: Fougeres, Landivy, Desertines, Louvigne du Desert, La Tanniere, La Futaie. Deprivation, isolation, repression, make visionaries and fanatics. In places of this sort religion is more binding, social conformity more pervasive, visions - or 'illusions' - are easier to share. On a more pedestrian level, as Kselman reminds us, miracles provide poor parishes with a source of revenue.39 The Pontmain basilica to Notre Dame de l'Esperance was still unfinished in I903, providing work in the midst of underemployment and, of course, tourist income. The same goes for La Salette, where the miracle was followed by miraculous economic effects and where new village priests quickly instituted a long- distance novena service, the income from their mail-order prayers being divided between clergy and locals. So apparitions are overdetermined, just like the apparently absurd beliefs of so many urban progressives. They may not make much sense in a twentieth-century perspective, but they make more sense in context than Muray allows, or than more narrow interpretations suggest. One closes the books of Kselman and Carroll with the feeling that the 'backward' populations of rural France managed their emotional and material problems not too badly, and agreeing with Kselman's conclusion that 'the number, significance and visibility of miracle cults and prophetic movements in France... suggest that our understanding of France's modernization must be revised '.40 But so much attention paid to the Virgin risks spoiling our perspective. Mary is a favourite of official religion; and that sort of religion, like politics (or feminism, or 3 Carroll, The Cult, p. 202. 3 For Saeur Nativite see Kselman, Miracles, pp. 70-1.

Country people worship the Virgin, of course - or rather their particular local Virgin, but they prefer their saints. As with the wooden Christs that hang from the cross in the country churches of western France or of Quebec, plain and heavy-featured in the image of those who adore them, the peasant prefers a saint he can recognize. Someone, for example, like the sixteenth-century Ste Germaine of Pibrac, near Toulouse, whose story is exemplary. Germaine was a sickly child, scrofulous, and with a withered hand. Ill-treated by her stepmother, fed on scraps, she slept in the stable, or in the cupboard under the stairs, where she died at 2 i. She had herded sheep since the age of 9. One winter day, her stepmother accused her of taking some stale bread from the breadpan, and ordered her to show what she held in her apron. Germaine opened the apron: it was full of spring flowers. Not long after that she died, leaving a story with the makings of a fairy tale as much as of sainthood. There are plenty of holy Virgins in Toulouse: Notre Dame du Taur, Notre Dame de la Dalbade, Notre Dame de la Daurade, but it is the Santa Vierja de Pibrac whom (Cholvy and Hilaire tell us) the women of the Toulouse region invoke in hard cases.41 III That may be why the Virgin plays a minor role in Judith Devlin's The superstitious mind, where she appears, when she appears, in a host of distinct and localized incarnations, as Our Lady of Lan-Kare, of Kernitou, of Le Crann, Revercourt, or wherever. A lot of squires' ladies, each a local patron or benefactress, related to the others but hardly the same person, whatever priests may say. Devlin's book is about the persistence within a purportedly rational and pragmatic civilization 'of a mass sub-culture characterized, on the intellectual level, by irrationality and confusion and, on an emotional level, by fear and instinct...'." Credulity regarding the supernatural ('agency above the forces of nature, outside the ordinary operation of cause and effect'), irrational fear of the unknown or mysterious, mark the superstitious minds that Devlin sets to plumb among French peasants. Yet Devlin questions the pejorative definitions. Just how supernatural did the supernatural appear to those who invoked it? Can it be dismissed as perverse irrationality? Was it irrational, was it confused, did it address agencies outside the ordinary operation of cause and effect? No more, surely, than contemporary urban attempts being made about the same time to comprehend, solicit and utilize hypothetical forces - mysterious enough, but not inaccessible to faith, persistence and a kind of logic. First, and basically for Devlin, the supernatural 'was in fact...assimilated to the natural and harnessed to its needs'.43 What some dismiss[ed] as superstition was religion - the fears, obligations and expectations that bind to Gods and to each other. In this light, nineteenth-century religion, at least that of the common people, was not about God and his purpose for man. What bound people together were 'common beliefs and ideas that reflected the economic and social restrictions on those who held them'.44 An inarticulate society with no access to more effective techniques translated need, greed, frustrated ambitions and the search for comforting explanations amidst acute discomfort, into commerce with the supernatural: a familiar exchange of goods and services between the relatively powerless and the relatively powerful. 41 Cholvy and Hilaire, Histoire religieuse, i, I63. 42 Judith Devlin, The superstitious mind.

The religion that flourished wrought miracles, brought health and even wealth, transformed life, alleviated monotony and suffering. Its marvellous powers operated practically in a next world for which the dead were buried with their false teeth, and variously equipped with bread, cakes, wine, plate, toys, sweets, walking stick or crutches or umbrella, or coin to pay for further facilities.45 But the marvellous powers of popular religion were not confined to the next world or the passage to it. They counted here and now, and saints were its chief agents. Saints filled roles nowadays assigned to doctors, psychiatrists, marriage guidance counsellors and social workers, insurance agents, private investigators and security services. They righted wrongs, cured illnesses or sped them to resolution, watched over soldiers, travellers, children and folk in distress, protected against thieves, hail, storm, fire, spells, evil spirits or conscription.46 Benign apocryphal St Bon had his miraculous fountain at Blesnan. Apocryphal or not, saints could heal, but also resolve awkward situations. In Normandy, St Va-et- Vient intervened to make the sick recover or die, rather than hang on as a burden to relatives. In Moselle one prayed to St Maur (mort) to speed the going of a dependant. In the Vosges, St Vivra, St Languit and St Mort fulfilled similar functions. They could also be invoked for more obviously maleficent ends. In the Cher, at St Mauvais's fountain, you could pray for the demise of enemy or rival. Bretons consulted Notre Dame de la Haine, near Treguier: three aves in her honour would cause an enemy to die within the year. A variety of 'religious' rituals - messe de Saint Sicaire, messe seche, messe de male-mort, messe du Saint Esprit - so common in the early twentieth century that sermons were preached against them, offered ways to rid oneself of those hated enough.4 In the society Devlin studies, God and his saints are as aggressive, vindictive, malicious, as those who invoke them. If improperly approached or treated with less than the deference they expect, they are apt to turn nasty. Ideally their wrath works against the powerful and rich, but it may also affect the thoughtless who dismiss them too easily or forget to pay their dues. On the other hand, when entreaties, bribes or cajoleries don't work, worshippers may adopt the maniere forte to draw the saint's attention, threaten or punish; and they do so with no apparent fear of retaliation. Some of these rites invoke sympathetic magic, as when saints are pelted with mud, nails or water to inspire cures or other interventions.48 Others are punishment for failure, urging better performance in the future. Statues, icons, relics, are whipped, thrown into rivers or wells, penned up, stood on their head, or turned face to the wall. This is familiar territory: man makes God and his court in his own image; no wonder he treats them in consequence. But Devlin goes well beyond. The rites she describes, like throwing mud at a statue of Saint Laurent to obtain a cure for eczema, are only 'tenuously connected with the desired results', and those who go through them do not regard them as mechanistically functional aspects of a process of cause and effect. Sympathetic magic does not work like homeopathic medicine, rather like catharsis. For it to function, its efficacy does not have to be evident: it operates at a level which is crucial but hardly visible.49 Magic, says Devlin, 'was a psychological technique with social rather than scientific overtones'. It furnished people with ways of expressing and sometimes overcoming disorienting feelings, of satisfying their dreams. And witchcraft (which subsumes church-related magic techniques) 'provided a social theory of misfortune', the means Ibid.

Fades, ondines, carrigans, dracs and other follets crystallize, then help dispel, worry and stress. They console and reassure the vulnerable and despised - for example, orphans afflicted with unkind stepmothers or siblings. They provide alibis, not just for coming home late or having spilt the milk, but for unavowable feelings like the dislike of children who could be identified as changelings, or dislike of one's family if the 'changeling' was oneself. Apparitions, prodigies, dragons, serpents, ogres, genies, vouivres, discouraged children from wandering too far afield, adults from exploring for the hidden treasure of others (i.e. their savings), and all from blundering into the hideouts of robbers and smugglers. But they addressed another level of reality too. In a society fearful of physical disaster and short of analytic vocabulary, legends allowed people to voice feelings about their environment, provided harmless expression for 'divisive and corrosive' impulses, reassured the vulnerable, helped express and exorcize anxieties and yearning and regrets.5' Devlin stresses the search for consolation and satisfaction in fantasy, the search for relief from a multiplicity of pressures, including boredom. For Devlin, miracles and visions flourish in a context of need and misery: not a new idea, but one she illustrates with reference to the popularity of the miraculous resurrection of stillborn babies long enough for them to be baptized; a merciful suspension of the natural order that affords a small triumph over suffering. She is quite right, as the vogue of sanctuaires a' repit attests, and their lessened attraction by the century's end, along with diminished interest in the sacrament of baptism.52 Neither vogue nor decline, Devlin would say, can be explained simply in terms of public health or of the politics of religion. I agree. Such extraordinary events helped salve a lot that only miracles could cure. They also afforded breaks from monotony, surrounded humble folk with unwonted prestige, provided opportunities to express inarticulate feelings of anxiety and rebellion.53 This was also where pilgrimages to shrines near and far came in as search for relief from trouble (admitted) and ennui (unformulated). The more difficult ordinary life, the more readily people flocked to shrines, eager to witness the miraculous transformation of an otherwise unyielding reality, and to believe the miraculous message of new and better things to come. Better times could only come, of course, after repentance, after apocalyptic changes, after the inauguration of a new order of things that simple people know is not for them, at least not for their time. So, apocalyptic prophecies too, popular as catharsis, are whittled to manageable proportions: specific miraculous interventions at some shrine, celestial letters, amulets, charms put to malevolent or beneficial use. Like storytellers, prophets and prophetesses, visionaries, healers, reflect the needs and dreams of their contemporaries, mostly poor contemporaries. What they offer is not extra-mundane, abstract, unrelated to reality. On the contrary. The successful visionary or witch must provide hope and opportunity for evasion here and now.54 Visions, easily dismissed as fraudulent, or as the symptom of a diseased mind, might well be attempts to draw attention. They were also taken up as emblems of hope and attempts to escape from ordinary life. In a world of deprivation where psychosomatic disorders were common, hysteria, possession, offered forms of escape accessible to the 50 Ibid. pp. Ioi, 83. 51 Ibid. p. 77. 52 Ibid. p. 64.

Spells were frequently invoked by hysterical girls to justify deviant behaviour. Visions or cases of possession could prove catching and spread to whole neighbour- hoods, endowing humble people with unfamiliar importance and with a temporary sense of power, providing novelty and excitement in the midst of dull routine. They also provided a rare opportunity for rebellious behaviour. Devlin recalls a classic case of epidemic possession that swept the alpine village of Morzine in the late I85os, affecting some I 20 people, mostly children and women: in other words those most deprived and least independent. At Morzine, blasphemy and physical violence went with rebellion against God, parents, mayor, priest, even the bishop of Annecy. This particular revolt against a harsh social and economic order only died down in the mid- I86os, when the forces of authority (police, soldiers, threats of hospitalization) intervened.56 Licit or exceptional, ritual or marginal, such doings, Devlin believes, were not really meant to work: heal, save, make things better. Like much of traditional medicine, she is inclined to view them as placebos which participants conspired to treat as real. She takes for example the respect accorded to the hawthorn which, sharing some of the properties of Christ's crown of thorns, protected from lighting or spells, and even afforded salvation to those who without it might die unshriven.57 Prayers addressed to the hawthorn - or to stones, streams, trees - were not invocations to an object endowed with anthropomorphic qualities. Like whistling in the dark, they provided a measure of relief, however illusory. Spells, of course, were meant to produce positive effects as well. They could be used to summon the devil (or a representative of the devil, usually in animal shape), preferably at midnight, preferably at a crossroads. And spellbooks carried awesome powers that could be used to terrorize feeble imaginations, as Charles Nisard put it at the time.58 Nisard's remark recalls Burke's view of superstition as the religion of feeble minds - when religion is simply the superstition of the successful. It reflects the urban sense of superiority, it ignores contemporary urban predispositions to savour the terrors of magic and, more surprising in a scholar like Nisard, it disregards the tendency of illiterates to regard all books as grimoires, unintelligible, hence mysterious. Witness the village teacher driven out of a parish in the i830S: 'il aurait ete lapide comme un sorcier. Un Virgile etait cependant tout son grimoire.'59 Devlin knows better. She reminds us that demonology and inventive magic exploit perennial phantasies of fabulous treasures to be found, of improving one's social position in extraordinary ways, of realizing the extraordinary dreams of people whom poverty confined to dreaming. Folktales, too, represent more than illusion or wishful thinking. They provide us (like magic) with the 'vocabulary of discontent':60 poor boys, poor girls, orphans, younger sons and daughters, deprived, ill-treated, triumph over circumstances, acquire status, luxury, success, unthinkable in real life. The impossible becomes possible. Ste Germaine of Pibrac found satisfaction in her goodness. Poudounette, the Breton Cinderella, reaps reward and revenge by being good: she marries a marquis.

For fairy stories are about reality; and so is magic. Devlin observes how much magic turns on treasures, love-potions, exemptions from military service. A twentieth-century study brings grist to her mill and demonstrates the lively survival of good spells designed to bring a 'good' number in the draft lottery, as of bad spells to make an enemy or rival draw a 'bad' number.61 For, of course, if personal interest comes first, in situations where goods are limited, my good is your harm, profit comes at the expense of someone else. Like Jules Michelet, Devlin discerns that 'hatred and envy lay at the heart of witchcraft '.62 The tendency to ascribe one's personal misfortune to the malevolence of others was a sort of wish fulfilment in reverse. Spells and accusations of spells reflect social and family relations that are often strained, jealousies, rancour, tensions, generated within close-knit poor communities in which discomfort and competition for bare necessities are a frequent source of ill will and strife. Sorcery and counter-sorcery exhibit this, and exacerbate it. Old women, beggars, marginals (shepherds, charcoal burners), exploit a reputation for magic power to provoke fear, and are resented, feared, hated in return. The magic violence of the vulnerable provokes the brutish retaliation of the terrified. Into the twentieth century men and women would be beaten, tortured, shot or brought to court, or have their barns and houses burnt, in this encounter of mutual resentment, intimidation and vengeance. But witchcraft has its positive side. The fear of God may inspire justice and charity; so may the fears of other powers. According to Evans-Pritchard, fear of spells is the beginning of wisdom, fear of reprisal can inspire good deeds or at least mutual tolerance. The moral of many a fairy tale is that one should be kind to the weak and helpless. The same moral can be drawn from tales of spells, often regarded as a punishment for failing in one's duties to neighbours, beggars, relatives, lovers, inferiors.63 Wielded as an instrument of primitive justice, a spell could threaten reluctant debtor or exigent creditor, reward or punish where no other sanction could be hoped for, thus encouraging generosity or moderation if only out of prudence. Hence the great rule of French country life: no hubris. Avoid the envy, jealousy, resentment of others; do not be overbearing, do not show off, do not excel too visibly, do not triumph over your fellows, for a spell may humble your pride. What is interesting about the spells discussed by Devlin is how much they borrow from official ritual: the importance of prayers, religious devotions, even of being in a state of grace. Pragmatically, magicians function like substitute priests or minor saints. They too are intercessors to whom one has easy recourse. They too procure wives or husbands, make spouses love each other, or hasten their demise. They recover lost property, find treasures, help avoid conscription, treat the sick, break charms, win lotteries, cure livestock, predict the future. It is less surprising, then, that some of their prescriptions - paters, aves, candles, masses -differ so little from orthodox supplica- tions.64 In magic rites the devil materializes, but so does the Virgin. Both take monetary transactions for granted, as did the priests who charged for their services, for the chairs 61 Emil Dave, Le Tirage au sort (Namur, 1934), p. 4 and passim. 62 Michelet, La Sorciere, pp. 24, 27, 29, 89, I28, I37.

Of course, devil and Virgin take on predictable form, fashioned by folklore, convention, snippets of popular literature and imagery, recollections of the church's teachings. Devlin points out that the Virgin seen by Catherine Laboure in I830 wore a white dress taille aa Vierge.65 And we remember that the ladies of La Salette and Lourdes dressed much like enfants de Marie: the former looks as she can be seen in devout pictures, dressed in white, beribboned, crowned with roses; the latter all in white, with veil, blue sash, and roses at her feet. Virgin, Devil, Priest. The greatest sorcerer, the one with most - or with the only - books, with access to the best-confirmed powers, was the priest. Montaigne and Voltaire, like Devlin, connect superstition with fear. But what more fearsome beliefs than those of established religion; and where could they be heard more fearsomely expressed if not by the priest in church, or on a mission? Black witches brought harm with the help of the devil. The priest was a white witch who did good with the help of God: he lifted spells, he exorcized demons, he repelled storms and hail and cleansed the land of vermin, he prayed for rain, bountiful harvests, fertility and healing. He could charm the trout by muttering his Latin. How far could his powers extend? Even books of miracles could perform miracles, religious texts or a semblance thereof could serve as amulets to be worn or, at critical junctures, swallowed. So could scapularies (see Catherine Laboure). In I908, a clerical review, L'Ami du clerge', questioned about swallowing holy images to obtain a cure, answered that the practice was acceptable, though only with clerical approval.66 But priests who had the power to exorcize could also say a dry mass (no water, wine or candles) to dry up an enemy. They could levitate at dusk on to the roof of those who did not pay their debts or tithe, and recite a book backwards to set off trouble and odd happenings in the house. They could drive off storms or hail, or make them fall on the neighbouring parish; or they could attract them, ruin their fellow-villages to avenge a slight or punish irreverence.67 Devlin knows how such accusations could hide 'natural' antagonisms, everyday squabbles over tithes or fees or moral conformity or precedence in seats and in processions.68 Further, since priests (like the priest at Corps) kept threatening their congregation with dire punishments, it was not unreasonable to attribute catastrophe to them when it occurred. If plague or defeat in war were presented as manifestations of God's wrath, why should not priests appear as Prussian agents or semeurs de peste, metteux de chole'ra, eventually responsible for the phylloxera as well? The same was true of doctors, also witches, also more costly than the traditional rebouteux and competing with them for popular confidence. If doctors found employment during epidemics, why shouldn't they be held responsible for them? Cui bono? If cholera killed more poor than rich, why shouldn't the rich and their catspaws have provoked the cholera to hurt those who, wishing so much to hurt them, attributed their own malevolence to those they envied? Suffering and anger turn to a primitive 65 Ibid. p.

It is not difficult to follow Devlin in conclusions that point to the heritage of traditional phantasies and popular imagery 'manipulated to justify personal resentments and animosities, to exculpate the guilty and inculpate their victims, to reinforce prejudice'. This, she says, would be channelled into the politics of the twentieth century, which reproduce the taste for blaming others for misfortune, the inclination to reallocate responsibility for difficulty and disaster, the old hostilities to wealth and power, the tendency to self-deception and self-justification, the delight in collective celebration and evasion through myth.69 All this is suggestive, especially when Devlin insists that 'superstition' is not unreasonable, but rational in its own terms, offering pilot charts to navigate the shoals and rapids of precarious life. Devlin is not quite sure how rational the 'superstitious' peasant mind really was. 'The evolution towards rationality was gradual...primitive and logical thought could...coexist in one mind.'70 But primitive was logical: the two did not conflict. The supposed confrontation between common sense and magic was actually a conflict between different kinds of magic and between different kinds of common sense. IV The context within which all this unravelled is presented and analysed in an excellent Histoire religieuse de la France contemporaine, recently published by Gerard Cholvy and Yves-Marie Hilaire. As I began by saying, though re-established by the Concordate of I 8o I, the hold of 'the religion of the majority of the French' had been much weakened by the Revolution. Before 1789 the church presided over all the great occasions of life: birth, marriage, death, and also the First Communion - that great rite of passage into the adult world. The church watched over the parish and over the conduct of its members, it helped the crops increase and cattle prosper, it taught and healed and preserved from harm. After 1789 it had to compete in all these realms with the secular power. Rites of passage were removed from its hands. Birth, marriage and death were registered by secular authorities and, after I882, the First Communion too would be overshadowed by the school-leaving certificate. Divorce, though abolished from i8I6 to i884, had been legislated once and would be re-established. Sunday was no longer the unchallenged day of worship and of rest. It had been secularized, attempts to re- sacralize it after i814 encountered indifferent success and managed only to stir up the politically potent opposition of tavern-keepers and employers. The proportion of unbaptized children, 7-4 per cent in I865, increased to 28 per cent in i885.7' The church had been inescapable in everyday life. After the Revolution it became an issue, sometimes a nuisance, before being marginalized. Meanwhile, its unquestioned hold had been broken, or at least weakened. This, one may speculate, is what makes the nineteenth century so rife with superstition, with occult cults, with counter-religions. All had existed before 1789; now the difficulties of orthodox religion gave them a chance to flourish - no longer underground, but visibly, at all levels of society. Part of the problem of official religion lay (and was reflected) in the shortage and insufficient training of its personnel. In I 815 the Catholic church was woefully short of priests. Tens of thousands of ecclesiastics had left it in the previous quarter-century, 69 Devlin, Superstitious mind, p. 2 I5. 7 Ibid. p. 92. 71 Cholvy and Hilaire, Histoire religieuse, II, 238.</page><page sequence="18">416 HISTORICAL JOURNAL some to retirement, some to civil life, some to anti-clericalism, some to dabble in the occult. Few had been replaced. Thousands of vicarages stood empty and, in those that did not, nearly half the incumbents were over 6o - an advanced age in those days. Julien Sorel had a promising future. He could have had a great career, like many a lower-class lad unfit for harder labour. And the attraction of holy orders would be the greater in times when celibacy was not exceptional: in Pas-de-Calais, Hilaire reminds us, in I85 I 30 per cent of the population between 30 and 34 years of age remained unmarried. This changed only towards the century's end and in the early years of the twentieth century. Alternative opportunities for social and economic promotion in schoolteaching and in the civil service cut ordinations by half in the score of years after I868. Economically enforced celibacy also shrank: in Pas-de-Calais from roughly one- third to about i 8 per cent of the 30-34 age group. But, even while early nineteenth-century conditions loomed fair, the peasants being trained and rushed into the breach the Revolution had opened faced an uphill task. The generation born after I 785 grew up in religious ignorance, uncatechized, unsermonized. The short contemporary life span (28 for men, 32 for women) meant that, through the first decades of the century, a majority of adults lacked the religious background of their elders.72 No wonder that religious practice was more slack; but also more vulnerable to heterodoxy, to enthusiasm, to individual or popular inter- pretation, to superstition. Amidst anarchy of observance, private enterprise thrived. Witness the abbe Ferdinand-Toussaint-Fransois Chatel, ordained in i8i8, placed under interdict in the I820S, then consecrated bishop by another eccentric: Dr Fabre-Palaprat. Fabr&amp; Palaprat was a chiropodist who proclaimed himself Grand Master of the Templars and Sovereign Pontiff of the Primitive Christian Catholic Religion: essentially, as described in his Livitikon of I83I, the church ofJohannite initiates as opposed to the mass church of Peter's unenlightened followers. Like Fabr&amp;Palaprat, Chatel too wanted to return to the simplicity of primitive Christianity and liked to refer to the Apocalypse ofJohn. He described himself as 'fondateur de 1 'Eglise unitaire, eveque par 1 'eection du peuple et du clerge', and achieved a modest success in the i830s, when the fortunes of the orthodox establishment were low. Several villages of the Paris region threw out their priests to install his adherents, who said mass in French and did not charge for chairs.73 Here was popular religion running wild. The crisis of the Terror had revealed the basic interests of parishioners left to themselves. In the absence of priests, rites of passage had been performed by civilians, propitiatory ceremonies had continued when needed, guardian saints had been defended. In August 1793 the municipal council of the not very pious parish of Saint- Chinian (Herault), where five priests were to be massacred a few months later, asked for a procession to pray for rain. At La Ferte-Gaucher (Seine-et-Marne), where the Jacobins had caused 'the Virgin and the saints to cry in churches', the peasants rioted, sacked the Jacobin club and forced the authorities to replace the statues in their church.74 Attachment to the church was focused on practical and protective activities - and on representatives of divinity expected to carry out such functions. Amidst anarchy, the restoration of religious discipline would not be easy. Clergy trained under the Restoration were not strong on learning. As Julien Sorel found in the seminary at Besanson, the church distrusted intellectual achievement. As the 72 Ibid.

But there was an element of suspicion there too: too much learning was dangerous, an invitation to speculation, questioning, doubt. Saintliness was better than bookishness.7" That may be why Cardinal Manning found the French episcopate 'chiefly remarkable for their goodness'. But the new saints in a surplice were better at scourging than forbearance. Qui aime bien cha'tie bien. In a country where dialects still used the term for 'fear' to express ' respect', their God was a God of fear, their faith excessively austere. Piety condemned the Devil and the Flesh together. In I 830, Paul-Louis Courier's Petition pour des villageois qu'on empeche de danser was much more than a jeu d'esprit. Dancing, especially Sunday dancing, became and continued a burning issue in many a village. The God of the thundering priest looked increasingly like (Pierre Hamp dixit) 'une machine pour embeter le pauvre monde'. The priest, often a peasant himself, 'toujours a debiner ses paroissiens, a les gourmander, a les traiter de rustres, de paysans', became the storm- centre of village conflicts. What went on in church was equated with fear, with punishment and hellfire, 'thoroughfare from a miserable life to an eternity of suffering'-" Rejected when possible as oppressive, intrusive and increasingly irrelevant, religious observance lived on as superstition: protective, part of simple folk's armoury of self- preservation. In Burgundy, where Philip Gilbert Hamerton lived in the I86os and I87os, religion for the peasants, at least the male peasants, was 'a sort of precaution which may not turn out to be of any use, but which it is as well to take.. si Sa ne fait pas de bien, Sa ne fera pas de mal'. In Bourbonnais, Emile Guillaumin's Simple man testifies to a similar frame of mind, sceptical but prudent, hence trying 'to please the Master of the Elements, who held a great part of our interests in his hands '.78 Occasional conformity did not imply devotion, not even belief. It reflected a reasonable concern for everyday interests in the preservation of which the church played a part. But such concerns focused on just those aspects of observance that critics of the church denounced as obscurantist and superstitious, and this placed the church in a quandary. Should it play the card of popular religion, and retain or regain the masses by its hold on their everyday hopes and fears? Or should it purify religion of ' superstitious' accretions, insist on a God-centred faith indifferent to material profit, to the here and now? In the event, church policy (if one can speak of a policy amidst a diversity of tactics and personal opinions) reflected both tacks. Against rationalists and free thinkers the church opted for miracles, prophecies and local devotions. Against the utilitarians in its midst it denounced backward superstitions that competed with official faith. The first confirmed the criticisms of its enemies and sharpened their contempt. The latter lost it the support of the popular masses. When local notables joined hands with clerics to discipline or repress disturbing popular religious activities focused on the healing functions of good fountains, stones, statues, bonfires; when priests explained away werewolves and apparitions with as much eloquence as local schoolteachers; when they hesitated to bless livestock or a repas des morts they encouraged doubt, disaffection, or quite simply indifference.

Priests who continued to allow it could be denounced for ignoring natural science. Priests who refused to countenance it provided opportunities for anticlerical mayors to insist on the traditional protective ritual and disparage the reluctant priest. Rigorism, scepticism, and attempts at rationalism, all reinforced this dilemma. The wonders of modern science did not help. One remembers the encounter between a farmer and his priest who reproves him for forgetting mass, then comments on the contents of the farmer's cart: 'Chemicals? But they are very bad, they burn the soil.' 'Monsieur le cure,' replies the peasant, 'I've had masses said and got no profit from them. I've bought chemicals and it worked. I'll stick to the better merchandise.' Ominous words, but not as decisive as they sound. Guillaumin's Tiennon believed in liming and in prudent observance. So did many others who continued to reinforce the magic of science with that of the church. From Minerve (Herault) the priest reports that no man observes Easter, but 'curiously' all men and youths join in parish 79 processions. Modern medicine appears in the same light. Urban observers cheered its advances against the redoubts of rural benightedness. They had a point, but the advance was halting. In I882, at Abondance (Haute-Savoie) a priest opened the stomach of a dying mother to baptize the foetus. In I883 a teaching nun at Saint-Malo-des-Trois-Fonts attributed epilepsy among her students to 'a spell cast on her school by those who wish it ill'. In I885, near Redon (Ille-et-Vilaine), another teacher-nun brought three of her girls to kiss the face of a girl dead of diptheria: two died. In I89I, near Chateaulin (Finistere) a stepfather strangled his I I-year-old stepdaughter and told her mother that, if he was not caught, he would have mass said, go round the chapel on his naked knees, and undertake a pilgrimage to Sainte-Anne-de-la-Palue.80 Anticlericals had a point. But doctors remained few and healers numerous. Even if one overcame suspicions of newfangled remedies, and if one could afford them, a mass would do no harm, nor would a healer. So, traditional techniques and new ones were not mutually exclusive. Nor did schooling, even universal instruction after i88I, have radical effects. As Cholvy and Hilaire point out, literacy and religious instruction went hand in hand. So did literacy and religious detachment. It was Flaubert who observed that when people ceased to believe in the Immaculate Conception, they would start to believe in turning tables. J. B. Durand, nineteen years old, judged at Limoges Assizes in I883, provides a living footnote to Bouvard et Pe'cuchet. Durand had been the first boy from Monsibre (Correze) to be sent off to school. As a result, we are told, he reads immoral books and obscene novels, distils undrinkable alcohols, scours the ruins of Muratelle castle in search of buried treasure... 81 No wonder that a contemporary priest concluded that the uprooting of old beliefs 'to which the clergy contributed as much as modern philosophism', had 'ruined faith without crushing superstition'; and he cites 'ce honteux cortege de magnetisme animal, de spiritisme, de somnambulisme ... les tables tournantes... On a beau se dissimuler sous le masque de la science et changer les termes, la realite reste la meme!

Before spiritualism there had been le parleur aux morts, now there were mediums. As Cholvy and Hilaire tell us, in the Nord, small superstitious sects proliferated among the dechristianized lower classes; in the republican South lo quefa parlar los morts took the place of the armier, the messenger of souls. Ernest Ferroul, holder of a medical degree from Montpellier, socialist, immensely popular deputy and mayor of Narbonne, was spirite - spiritualist and medium.83 v Still, newfangled practices, religious or superstitious as one wills, did better in town than in the country. Religious practice shrank everywhere as opportunity for personal choice expanded, as material wellbeing grew and, along with it, alternative sources of diversion and reassurance became available. But conformism is social, hence local. Those who left hamlet or village for an urban centre exchanged one conformity for another. Those who stayed, by and large conformed to regional patterns of religious detachment or attachment, or of militant anticlericalism. In most cases, however, as founts of traditional dread tarried, as famines, dearths, wolves, rabies, plagues, grandes peurs, turned into history, religious practice became a personal choice, its magic appeal focusing less on communal interests and more on practical or personal concerns. A remarkable ethnological study, Alban Bensa's Les Saints guerisseurs du Perche-Gouet (Paris, 1978) tells what happened next. Every other work under review is broad in scope. Bensa's monograph focuses narrowly on one aspect of popular observance in a restricted region, less than 250 square miles between Chartres and Le Mans. Yet his findings open vast horizons, because what we see foreshortened in his tale is the relation between church and popular religion, between the magic of lay folk and of priests, first operating then withering; and, declining with it, the popular interest in religious sanction which clerical participation had maintained. The crux of a study that provides rich footnotes to Cholvy, Hilaire, and especially to Devlin, lies in the search of common men and women for magic that will work. The culture Bensa plumbs values efficacy above everything. 'It works or it doesn't work.' The healing saints whom Bensa studies (and they are all he studies) have to be made to work. Traditional intermediaries offer their services as diviners or intercessors to see that they do: voyageuse, reveuse, dormeuse, somnambule. Such professionals, vicariously performing healing rites on behalf of their clients, subsisted in I970. Some lived from the income their functions brought, others used it as additional income while working their farms alone or en famille. When one such voyageuse is taken to court for illegal practice of medicine, she is acquitted. Her local prestige is great. Not only common people, but priests, chatelains and physicians turn to her in difficult cases of spells and witchcraft (d&amp;senvouztement and mauvais sorts). She presides over the ceremonies surrounding the midsummer Feux de Saint Jean, and priests place her at the head of religious processions.84 Ideally, though, one does without intermediaries. The voyage, of course, can be performed by a particular postulant, alone, in procession, or in an organized pilgrimage. The thing to remember is that a saint's healing powers are related to time and place. For example, from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth, Sainte Mabile's 83 Cholvy and Hilaire, Histoire religieuse, II, 36, 2I6; also I, 292. 84 Alban Bensa, Les Saints guerisseurs du Perche-GouRt (Paris, I978), pp. 40-3.</page><page sequence="22">420 HISTORICAL JOURNAL fountain near Brou healed fevers and other maladies. A local squire built a cross beside it, but no other official recognition came: no priest, no mass. Yet pilgrims and voyageuses still trudged to the fountain in I972, the locals cleaned the spring and kept the scrub in check around the cross, the cult subsisted (then at least) without official sanction. On the other hand, saints who are forced to move will make transport difficult or simply shift back to their original home, as Sainte Barbe did when displaced from her oratory to the church of Marolles-les-Buis nearby, returning by herself to the field where her chapel now stands.85 If site is crucial, so is date. The pilgrimage to be effective has to be made on the exact day of the saint's feast, not the preceding Sunday or the following one. For over a century local priests have tried to meld saint's feast and Sunday mass. Popular response remains 'very reticent'. If the saint is not celebrated on the traditional day, his or her pilgrimage dwindles in importance, and the faithful divide, some observing the saint's own day, others that chosen by the priest. Bensa cites the example of one parish where, between I9I2 and I953, most of the locals maintained the traditional date, only newcomers to the parish following the priest's choice.86 Where this sort of break occurs, the results for worship are dire. At St Lubin near Authon, the church ceased to serve during the Revolution and the parish was attached to nearby Authon in I8802, after the Concordat. But the pilgrimage to St Lubin continued popular. Until I960, the vicar of Authon would come to St Lubin on I4 March and I5 September to recite mass and read the scriptures. Then he began to celebrate the saint's days in Authon parish church, the Sunday following. The feast's attraction waned, St Lubin's statue was moved from its twelfth century site to Authon and, by the I970s, his worship was a memory.87 At La Bazoche-Gouet the great pilgrimage to St Gourgon, whose false relics had been brought there from Rome in the seventeenth century, went hand in hand with the major annual fair. In I970 a new parish priest tried to 'fight against superstition', shifting the celebration from 9 September, a weekday, to the following Sunday - a decision that disturbed not only habits of worship but the commercial connexion of the feast. At La Bazoche-Gouet the struggle about when St Gourgon's day should be celebrated was still going on when Bensa wrote his book. But there as elsewhere, when fair and pilgrimage no longer coincide, both decay.88 Shifting the date of ceremonies affects their efficacy. So do other changes in ritual. In I848, at Combres, where the patron is St Antony, the parishioners want to oust their priest because on I 7 January he leads the saint's procession leftwards round the church, not right as it should go: 'les processions 'a gauche, voyez vous, dam! on dit que ca fait mourir le monde plus vite'. The feud between concerned worshippers and parish priest accused of sorcery and of bringing bad weather fostered anticlericalism, and brought about the decline of an important local pilgrimage centre. Today there is no more pilgrimage at Combres.89 But the issue is still alive elsewhere. At St Eman - original of Proust's Guermantes - the patron saint of the parish is specially good for rain: 'on vient de Beauce chercher la pluie du Perche'. The pilgrimage to St Eman, abandoned in I963, would be taken up again in I97I at the request of many parishioners supported by the Societe des Amis de Marcel Proust. In I972, however, the priest, refusing to turn around the saint's miraculous fountain, took the procession round the church instead. Whatever literary sightseers thought, 'les gens n'etaient pas contents'. No wonder. How could a healing fountain heal in such 8 Ibid. pp. I87, I46-7. 86 Ibid. p. 37. 87 Ibid. p. 6i. 88 Ibid. pp. 63, I40- 8 Ibid. pp. I4I-2.</page><page sequence="23">HISTORIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW 42I conditions? As for rain, for St Eman to bring it his bust must be dipped three times in his spring, then carried round the church with its face to the West. Turned East, the saint's face brings sunshine: distinctions that self-respecting modern priests despise, when they do not ignore them.90 By now probably most of the population do so too. If they remembered them so long it was not only because in magic practices ritual details matter, but because saints and their observance were an integral part of the agrarian cycle, their feasts concentrated when the local work schedule made them most convenient,91 their personalities similar to those of their worshippers. Like kings in fairy tales, who survey their fields and send their daughters out to bring the hero lunch, saints are close to home. As their parishes fight each other, so do neighbouring saints, and St Lhomer throws large stones at St Laurent. Like feudal lords they are combative and vengeful. St Evroult heals white sores, but may also inflict them - as he did upon the priest of Mignieres who laughed about his powers.92 What we behold is the standard supernatural exchange of goods and services: healing against worship, aid against attentions and deference. The people need the saints, but saints need their popular clientele as professors need graduate students. Their influence and prestige depend on it. Like professors, the saints resent indiscriminate appeals to too many colleagues and react by leaving the help requested to another, so that nothing is done. They demand sustained devotion, not just one-time appeals or a perfunctory ex voto, and may react to slights by causing a return of the mal they cured. And they expect honourable treatment: at Soize in the I830s, St Gille, being transferred from his original chapel to the village church, kept the oxen that pulled his cart from crossing a ford until an improvised procession came to greet and escort him to his new home.93 Site, Bensa makes clear, is crucial not just as locus of miracles, but as centre of a cat's cradle of interrelated factors. There is local pride and the boost it gets from association with a saint, as nowadays with a football team. There is also situation - in forest, at crossroads, best of all near borders or boundaries between parishes or provinces, between cultivated land and forest or waste, between fields remade by human labour and the dangerous forces of the non-human realm. The above-mentioned Authon, for example, is close to the Sarthe, which is known as a pays de sorciers et de d&amp;senvouiteurs.94 La Bazoche-Gouet is at a physical transition between hilly country and pasturage, on the verge of the Beauce. We may recall that Pontmain too is set in a borderland, close to forests and springs, and to 'deserts' dear to hermits and smugglers. Such places are nurseries of witches and saints, both of whom draw on the inspiration lodged in particular localities. The church, however, is supra-local, indifferent or hostile to local interests. The priest, who occupies a key position in the exchange of magic goods and services, can foster such activities or stifle them. In Bensa's survey he appears in a negative role, and tends to flush out the baby with the bathwater. Not only do Perche priests shed their magic and insist on being like other men; they shed the crux of their function. As religious practice wanes, the clergy tries to purify the faith of the remaining faithful, fights unorthodox practices, condemns the past and its superstitions. For the church, saints are intercessors to whom God lends his powers. For the peasants it is the powers that matter, and those who [appear to] wield them or refuse to do so. Religion is a stock 90 Ibid. pp. II I-2, 200. 91 Ibid. p. 207 f.: a very important point. 92 Ibid. pp. I63, 8o. 93 Ibid. pp. I73, 77- 94 Ibid. pp. 6o-i.</page><page sequence="24">422 HISTORICAL JOURNAL of merchandise sold in a local store. The storekeeper is the priest; the church is the church of the priest. 'The priest has his business, I have mine', says one of Bensa's peasants.95 If men do not attend mass on Sundays or even at Easter, they attend the saint's day and the pilgrimage, because that gives them what they want. Like the old man at Moulhard, near Authon, who does not trouble to remove his beret and grumbles when mass goes on too long, they wait to approach the statue of St Marcou or another and to proceed with healing rites. In the back of the church one hears 'je suis pas venu pour le Bon Dieu, mais pour le saint'. There lies the difference. Saints do not evoke Christ, but healing and protection.96 For the priest, popular traditions are marginal to his ministry. For his parishioners they are essential, and the priest's ministry can easily become marginal. When the priest shows no interest in what interests the peasant, their businesses no longer coincide. When the village church no longer fulfils its practical functions, it becomes irrelevant. This is the process Bensa traces, as the French say en fihligrane: the persistence of traditional practices and their crumbling less under the impact of modern technology than under that of clerical hostility. Characteristic of how this works is the church's attitude to the healing powers attributed to the marcou: the seventh son, preferably the seventh son of a seventh son, endowed with thaumaturgic powers just as kings had been, but more durably than kings. Since the sixteenth century at least, marcous have been connected with Saint Marcou or Marcoul and priests have insisted on the saint's role in the healing process: 'example of the church's struggle against popular traditions', comments Bensa, and of its volonte' de re'cupe'ration. But recuperation is not enough. At Moulhard, mentioned above, the Perche's best- known pilgrimage shrine to St Marcou, the i 86os saw an attempt to supplant the saint by placing the church under the patronage of the Virgin Mary and by favouring her feast (I5 August) over that of the native saint (I May).97 There is no evidence that the campaign worked, but it illustrates the church's tendency to take over the practical aspects of pilgrimages and other pious activities, to reclaim their therapeutical or protective functions, to separate devotion to a saint from practical agrarian or other applications. As medical practice develops and becomes more effective, the church concentrates therapy in a few great centres like Lourdes, and focuses on faith. The cult of saints itself becomes more official and less practical. Attempts are made to replace the cult of interloper saints, like St Marcou, with more acceptable devotions, preferably to the Virgin; which also replace the local and specific by more distant, more universal objects of devotion. On the other side of France, in the Ain of the cure d'Ars, 'the monumental and affective omnipresence of the Immaculate Virgin had dealt a hard blow to old local devotions', including old-established marial sanctuaries. One cannot help wondering whether the marial offensive of mid-century, partly inspired by the Virgin's romantic popularity, was not above all an attempt to displace traditional observances - superstitions embarrassing to a hierarchy aware of the criticism to which they exposed it and eager to discipline its unruly faithful. Only relatively successful against local saints, the new cult of the Immaculate Mary eclipsed local marial sanctuaries, including the sanctuaires a reipit; it overwhelmed many limited local cults, and replaced collective practices by the personal devotion to a tender, loving, private presence. The great marial apparitions we surveyed and the 95 Ibid. p. 232. 96 Ibid. pp. 76, 234- 9 Ibid. pp. 50, 76.</page><page sequence="25">HISTORIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW 423 publicity they received reinforced this trend, transferring piety from the parish level to a transcendent object, just when patriotism too was being transferred from the petite patrie to the grande. Church and state, at loggerheads about politics, were at one in their efforts to uproot popular culture. However, while national patriotism found justification in economic and cultural interests, the economic and cultural interests that had maintained religious attachment at the parish level began to wither when detached from it. Philippe Boutry concludes: 'La paroisse perd dans ce mouvement une part de sa validite: elle encadre de fason plus indistincte des fidles regis desormais par la diversite de leurs opinions religieuses. '8 The services of the church, devalued from within, were losing their hold; and, as they did, so did the church whose major role had been to provide them. Curiously, some of Bensa's closing observations recall the remarks of much earlier observers. Bensa is struck by his informers' use of the imperfect tense. They say 'In the old days...' or else 'In Orne they believe...' or 'It doesn't exist any more, but you still find it in such and such a place.' A hundred years before Bensa, Laisnel de La Salle had heard old storytellers in Berri closing their tales with 'Ce sont li des contes de vieux; les jeunes s 'en amusent.' Emile Littre, too, was struck by the slow but irresistible obsolescence of the supernatural. 'Henceforth miracles appear only to those who begin by believing in miracles.'99 One must object that those who believed in miracles continued numerous, that the obsolescence of the supernatural proved less irresistible than some took it to be, that the young were laughing less heartily than it seemed, or else they changed their mind. Should we view the decline which Bensa chronicles in that perspective? Or have circumstances changed so irretrievably, at last, that the old beliefs have no leg left to stand on? The books reviewed suggest a Scottish verdict: Not Proven. As far as one can tell, official religion always overlaid, masked, overlapped with, a host of practices that sometimes competed with it and sometimes used its facilities for their own ends. When it did not ignore these, the ecclesiastical hierarchy devised its own strategies to cope with them. It persecuted, co-opted, tolerated, condemned, tried to take over, squeeze out, eliminate, incorporate 'superstitious' practices. Witness the miracles, prophecies and apparitions Carroll and Kselman discuss. The 'superstitions' meanwhile adjusted and adapted just as actively, not only to religion but to changing circumstances and conditions. Witness the evolution of superstitious minds and the way modern medicine and psychology tried to come to terms with it. For Devlin, magic practices are strategies of impotence. Such strategies altered as the nature of insecurity, the sources of fear, the objects of desire altered. They did not 'survive', they did not disappear. Muray's book displays the - mostly urban - superstitious mind assimilating scientific advances and political challenges. Bensa shows how rural communities adjusted to radically new material conditions and intensified cultural pressures. The situation that was moving to a close in the nineteenth century is still moving to a close in the twentieth. Religion and superstition, saurs ennemies, rather like Siamese twins, are not through dying. 98 Boutiy, Pritres, p. 506.
