<plain_text><page sequence="1">1084 REVIEWS Ecology, Vol. 59, No. 5 Ecology, 59(5), 1978, p. 1084 ? 1978 by the Ecological Society of America The California Quail Even ecologists feel anthropomorphic temptations when watching California Quail, popularly pictured as "charm- ing," "engaging," "delightful," or "benevolent" toward chicks. These presumed traits and a convenient populational tolerance to hunting have propelled this bird to fame (ac- claimed State Bird of California, 1931). Yet until recently, curious naturalists or hunters have had to sift through widely dispersed sources of highly variable quality to learn of the species. Fortunately the first definitive "biography"1 is a good one, as one would expect from a biologist named Leo- pold. The author's "intent is to assemble in one set of covers all that is known to date about the ecology, natural history, and management of the species . . . one of the finest game birds of North America." He succeeds in unifying the data of orig? inal researchers (Sumner, Howard, Emlen, Glading, and oth? ers), the findings of his own graduate students (Genelly, Raitt, Lewin, Francis, Jones, Fletcher, and Erwin), and the habitat management recommendations of Ian McMillan, Ray Conway, and the California Department of Fish and Game. Philosophically "management" sets the tone of the book, but basic biology provides the structural framework. Initially Leopold provides historical perspective: native range and subsequent introductions, population responses to hunting and game management programs, and effects of changing land use on quail habitat. Then the major section of the book concentrates on quail natural history?sociality, reproduction (including proximate and ultimate factors), and population biology. Finally Leopold returns to management, where basic biology is integrated with human capacity to affect quail populations through hunting and habitat manip? ulation. Three original papers form appendices: Nisson de? tails aboriginal use of quail in California, Browning summa- rizes food habits studies, and Erwin analyzes rainfall as a factor influencing quail reproduction. Leopold writes crisply and arranges his material logically. Repetition of facts in different chapters is acceptable, for it enables the reader to extract useful information at any point in the book. A detailed table of contents and subject index both facilitate information retrieval. Ninety-five figures and forty tables complement the text. Gene Christman's drawings are simple but effective. Spelling and grammatical errors are few (Ferkovich of Campbell et al. 1973, deserves correction). Both writer and publisher demonstrate professionalism throughout. 1 Leopold, A. Starker. 1977. The California quail. Uni? versity of California Press, Berkeley, California. xx 4- 281 p. $14.95. Literature review reaches selectively into 1975 and 1976. No mention is made of Hubbard's paper on avian evolution (1974, The Living Bird 12:155-196), which proposes Pleis- tocene differentiation of the related quails in glacial refugia in the arid Southwest. Several papers by Stokes and Williams (1968-1972 Auk articles) would have added a bit to Leopold's treatment of vocalizations. These omissions, however, are minor; Leopold has done his selecting and synthesizing care- fully. The related factors of rainfall and nutrition are examined closely with respect to effects on quail reproduction. Prog- ress has been made, but questions remain unanswered. Leo? pold's discussion may help focus the necessary research. Social systems of quail offer promising opportunities for insightful study by evolutionary biologists. Male-biased sex ratios, dual parental care, and flocking have not been ex? amined seriously by biologists asking questions about natural selection. In this book, as in most quail articles, there are references to unmated males serving as foster parents: "... lone cocks seem at all times to have a solicitous interest in caring for chicks .... Whole broods may be taken over by these benevolent 'uncles1 .... Unmated cocks gather up the strays and thereby assist with the rearing . . . . A presumed advantage of this parental strategy is that care of young by the male of a pair or by an unmated cock frees the female to incubate a second brood" (p. 93, 97, 257). Why unmated cocks should behave with such apparent altruism is never asked. Do adoptions involve genetic "uncles," and if so, how is kin-recognition effected? Can adoption be a strategy of gathering others, perhaps more vulnerable, around oneself in a "selfish herd" defense against predation? Note that manip? ulation of the young birds as "cover" may not be detrimental to the young birds either, if feeding or defense options are improved by the merger. Do adoptive males thereby increase mating likelihood the following breeding season? Study of marked individuals of known relatedness can yield important answers to these questions that apparently have not been asked. The California Quail ably fulfills the goals of its author. It is more than a single-species book; it is practical field ecology with multiple lessons for anyone interested in land and wild? life. Walter L.
