<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PERIODICAL OBSERVER Reviews of articles from periodicals and specialized journals here and abroad Learning from Communism's Fall A Survey of Recent Articles From its birth in 1917 until its death last summer, Soviet communism had a pro- found impact on Western political thought and behavior. The Soviet Union was not just another nation, but history's first fully "socialist" society. The Russian Revolu- tion, Martin Malia, a professor of Russian history at Berkeley, notes in Commentary (Oct. 1991), became "the great polarizing event in 20th-century politics," turning the division between Left and Right into a chasm. And a chasm it remained, despite all the evidence over the decades that the Soviet regime was on a moral plane with Hitler's Third Reich. As late in the Cold War as 1983, when President Ronald Rea- gan declared the Soviet Union an evil em- pire, many liberal Americans scoffed. Yet just a few years later, the masses of people who lived in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe made it clear that they had had quite enough of the great "socialist" ex- periment. Reagan was proven correct, U.S. Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska said last September in announcing his can- didacy for the Democratic presidential nomination; indeed, he added, "we are seeing that the evil was worse than most imagined." The final collapse of Soviet communism thus throws a harshly reveal- ing light not only on what happened there during the decades past, but on what hap- pened here, in the thoughts and actions of liberals and conservatives, of academics and makers of U.S. policy. In recent decades, scholarly study of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the Third World has been strongly influenced by "a [revisionist] school of thought that . . . exaggerated the achievements of communism and belittled its failures," Walter Laqueur of the Center for Strategic and International Studies contends in Par- tisan Review (No. 3, 1991). "While Lenin's mistakes and Stalin's crimes were not de- nied, it was argued that by and large, and in a long-term perspective, these were less significant than the political, social, and economic achievements of the communist regimes." Such misjudgments, Laqueur says, were made not just by the Left but also by "the political and academic estab- lishment, the media, and even Western intelligence - as shown, until very re- cently, by the erroneous estimates of the Soviet and East European economies." When the Cold War was being fought, liberals did not always regard communist regimes with sympathy or sneer at "cold warriors." President John E Kennedy, for example, on taking office in 1961, pro- claimed U.S. willingness to "pay any price, bear any burden ... to assure the survival and the success of liberty." And his succes- sor, Lyndon B. Johnson, plunged America into what was often described as "the lib- erals' war" in Vietnam. But after the 1960s, American liberals contributed little to the West's Cold War victory, argues Na- tional Interest editor Owen Harries in POLITICS &amp; GOVERNMENT 7 FOREIGN POLICY &amp; DEFENSE 1 1 ECONOMICS, LABOR &amp; BUSINESS 14 SOCIETY 136 PRESS &amp; MEDIA 139 RELIGION &amp; PHILOSOPHY 141 SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY 143 &amp; ENVIRONMENT ARTS &amp; LETTERS 147 OTHER NATIONS 150 WQ WINTER 1992 7</page><page sequence="2">PERIODICALS Commentary (Oct. 1991). "[T]°° many of them are on record as disputing the reality or the point of the Cold War, too many have argued for accommodation, too many have found it difficult to condemn the Soviet system - have even praised it and maintained it was not very different from ours - too many of them have done all these things for them now to be able to claim responsibility for the victory with any conviction." One group that does deserve major credit, Harries says, is the U.S. policymak- ers of the mid- and late- 1940s - Dean Ach- eson and the other "wise men," many of them liberals, who devised the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO, the Bretton Woods agreement, and the strat- egy of containment. "There was nothing inevitable about containment, and there was nothing inevitable about the eco- nomic recovery of Europe and Japan and the phenomenal development of world trade - they were all politically contrived. If they had not been, there would have been nothing inevitable about the collapse of communism, either." After the Vietnam War, however, it was mainly the conservatives who carried the ball. They staunchly supported deterrence and ample defense budgets, and, writes Harries, "never equated concern about the Soviet threat with 'paranoia' and 'ob- session,' as many liberals did." Conserva- tives correctly perceived Soviet totalitar- ianism as "an unmitigated evil that had to be fought at all costs." Still, their vision was not perfect, he concedes. They "often exaggerated the extent and durability of Soviet power and the threat it repre- sented." In that exaggerated view of the Soviet bear, conservatives had many scholarly specialists for company. "In retrospect," writes University of Vermont historian Robert V. Daniels in the New Leader (Sept. 9-23, 1991), "perhaps Sovietology's great- est fault was grossly overestimating the strength of the Soviet bloc - its physical and economic capabilities as well as its po- litical cohesion and psychological stam- ina." W. R. Connor, director of the Na- tional Humanities Center at Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, contends in the American Scholar (Spring 1991) that Western Sovietologists peered at Soviet re- ality through the thin slit of social science and missed "the passions - the appeal of ethnic loyalty and nationalism, the de- mands for freedom of religious practice and cultural expression, and the feeling that the regime had simply lost its moral legitimacy." In the 1970s, Laqueur notes, it became bad form in liberal academic and political circles even to use the term totalitarianism in reference to the Soviet system. In the Soviet Union itself, he observes, there is today no such reluctance. It would be unrealistic, in Laqueur's view, to expect "a collective admission of guilt in Western revisionist thought. To own up to mistakes is a painful process." Many of those who argued for years that the United States was at least as much to blame for the Cold War as the Soviet Union will not soon abandon their posi- tion, he notes. "It has already been said that there have been no winners and los- ers, for America has ruined herself in the course of an unnecessary arms race - not to mention the domestic political and psy- chological damage that has ensued - re- sulting in the militarization of our thinking and our political culture." That view, Laqueur says, belongs in a satirical novel; it will not "cut much ice" outside the cir- cles of those scholars and journalists who feel compelled to defend their record. Leftist academics such as economist Samuel Bowles of the University of Massa- chusetts, Amherst, are trying to accentuate the positive. The demise of communism in Eastern Europe, he writes in the Chronicle of Higher Education (Apr. 4, 1990), was "the end of a nightmare, not the death of a dream." No longer will the "bureaucratic centralism and official Marxism of Eastern Europe [be] an albatross around the necks of the Left in U.S. universities." U.S. social- ists, he says, never had "public ownership [or] the end of the market [as their] objec- tive They were a possible means to the end of fairness and democracy." WO WINTER 1992 8</page><page sequence="3">Sociologist Paul Hollander, writing in the Chronicle of Higher Education (May 23, 1990), is not convinced. In academe, Marxism has come to serve "as a stick with which to beat Western pluralist-capitalist systems and their cultures Our Marx- ist academics knew little about existing so- cialist societies and were not in the least [eager] to learn more or to criticize them; they were afraid that such criticism might put them in the unsavory company of 'cold warriors' or 'red bashers."' The fall of communism is no more likely to disturb their faith than did its dismal record of performance in decades past. In the view of William G. Scott and Da- vid K. Hart, co-authors of Organizational Values in America, the collapse of commu- nism ought to call into question the ideol- ogy of "managerialism." The communist regimes, they write in Society (Mar. -Apr. 1991), "were managed societies, and their managers proved incapable of satisfying the aspirations of the people We too PERIODICALS are a managed nation " Be that as it may, it is the status of social- ism that is now most at issue. Princeton's Paul Starr, co-editor of the liberal Ameri- can Prospect (Fall 1991), is hopeful that liberals will now face up to that reality. It is finally time, he says, for liberals \o cut loose from socialism, even socialism !of the democratic sort. "It is now indisputable that communism impoverished the people who lived under it, and it is not clear how or why a more democratically planned so- cialist economy would do much better - or that such a system is feasible at all." Now, liberals must focus on the reform of capitalism. "Whatever the party of reform once may have had to learn from the ideas of socialism, it has already absorbed; in- deed, some of what it learned, it ought to unlearn. Those who have believed social- ism to be a higher stage of liberalism now need to take to heart, not the great vision of socialist theory, but the bitter disap- pointment of the practice." POLITICS &amp; GOVERNMENT Dry Rot? "The Fragility of Liberalism" by Christopher Lasch, in Salma- gundi (Fall 1991), Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 12866. In the very hour of its greatest triumph, in the very nation that has been its champion, liberal capitalism is in an alarming state of decay. "[T]he signs of impending break- down are unmistakable," warns Lasch, an iconoclastic historian and author of The True and Only Heaven (1991). "Drugs, crime, and gang wars are making our cit- ies uninhabitable. Our school system is in a state of collapse. Our [political] parties are unable to enlist the masses of potential voters into the political process." And the emerging U.S.-dominated global culture, far from reflecting a regard for human dig- nity and other liberal values, is "the cul- ture of Hollywood, rock and roll, and Mad- ison Avenue ... a culture of hedonism, cruelty, contempt, and cynicism." This dangerous state of affairs Lasch partly blames on the allegiance of liber- als - classical and modern - to the false god of unending progress. Their commit- ment led during the past century to the creation of a consumer society and to the centralization of economic and political power, which robbed citizens of their inde- pendence. But since the American Revolu- tion, liberals have made another big mis- take, in Lasch's view. They have imagined, with Virginia political theorist John Taylor (1753-1824), that a properly designed po- litical system alone would ensure the health of American society, that a society's institutions "may be virtuous, though the individuals composing it are vicious." By the 19th century, liberals were left with only one prop for civic virtue: The obligation to support a family, they WQ WINTER 1992 9</page><page sequence="4">PERIODICALS thought, would overcome the individual man's selfishness. Today, even "the higher selfishness of marriage and parenthood" is losing its influence. "Liberalism promised progress, abun- dance, and above all privacy. The freedom to live as you please, think and worship as you please - this privatization of the good life was liberalism's greatest appeal. Hav- ing set definite limits to the powers of the state, at the same time relieving individ- uals of most of their civic obligations, lib- erals assumed that they had cleared away the outstanding obstacles to the pursuit of happiness." But they also unwittingly cleared away the foundations of civic life. As today's overburdened state defaults on its assigned responsibilities, Lasch con- tends, citizens will have to meet their own needs by, for example, patrolling their own neighborhoods. That is to the good, in Lasch's opinion, because it will help to re- vive the spirit of self-reliance and neigh- borly cooperation. Yet many Americans, living in cities or suburbs where the shop- ping mall offers the only "community," have lost the habit of self-help. To help them regain it, ironically, government ac- tion is needed: policies to strengthen fam- ilies and initiatives, such as school vouch- ers, to give them more control over the professionals who so affect their lives. In- deed, Lasch says, "it is hard to see how the foundations of civic life can be restored, unless this work becomes an overriding goal of public policy." Stressing The Negative "Negative versus Positive Television Advertising in U.S. Presi- dential Campaigns, 1960-1988" by Lynda Lee Kaid and Anne Johnston, in Journal of Communication (Summer 1991), Univ. of Pa., 3620 Walnut St., Philadelphia, Pa. 19104-6220. As the countdown to the presidential elec- tion begins, Americans are bracing for an onslaught of "negative" political ads on television. That is what they got last time - and to an unprecedented extent, to hear many reporters and political pundits tell it. Especially offensive, said the critics, was President George Bush's 1988 campaign, with its notorious commercial about fur- loughed murderer Willie Horton. After examining 830 TV political ads aired in the eight presidential campaigns from 1960 through 1988, however, communication Many observers insisted that mud-slinging was the 1988 presidential candidates' main activity. specialists Kaid, of the University of Okla- homa, and Johnston, of the University of North Carolina, see a different picture. The proportion of "negative" ads - i.e. those focused on the alleged defects of the opponent - reached its height, Kaid and Johnston found, not in 1988, but in 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson's cam- paign used the famous "Daisy Girl" com- mercial to suggest that Barry Gpldwater would start a nuclear war. Forty percent of the political ads used in the general elec- tion campaigns that year were negative. In the 1976 Carter-Ford contest, by contrast, only 24 percent were. The proportion in- creased to 36 percent in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan squared off, but has hardly changed at all since. In 1988, Kaid and Johnston report, attack ads were 37 percent of the total. Negative political ads are not all bad, the authors point out. In fact, they are more likely to contain information about politi- cal issues than the positive ones, which celebrate the supposed virtues of the spon- soring candidate. The most surprising of Kaid and John- ston's findings, however, is this: In the WQ WINTER 1992 10</page><page sequence="5">PERIODICALS 1988 election, 32 percent of Bush's ads were negative - compared with 41 percent of Democratic candidate Michael Duka- kis's. The Republican's negative pitch that year clearly was a lot more memorable - and also, it seems, a lot more effective. Rights Run Amok "'Absolute' Rights: Property and Privacy" by Mary Ann Glendon, in The Responsive Community (Fall 1991), 714 Gelman Library, The George Washington Univ., Washington, D.C. 20052. Under the spell of philosopher John Locke and the lectures on law of Sir William Blackstone, Americans from the beginning talked about property rights as if they were absolute. In practice there was a good deal of public regulation of property. The Fifth Amendment, for example, recognized the federal government's power of eminent domain. But the extravagant rights talk had a strong influence, Harvard Law Pro- fessor Glendon notes. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the U.S. Supreme Court's extreme view of property rights led it to reject much social legislation, delay- ing the nation's transition to a mixed econ- omy and a welfare state until the Court re- versed itself in the 1930s. In recent years, Glendon argues, absolutist rights talk has reappeared in the courts and passed into common discourse, only this time the rhetoric is about privacy, not property. The Supreme Court and lawyers in gen- eral, Glendon says, have thought of the right of privacy "as marking off a pro- tected sphere that surrounds the individ- ual," and dressed the new right up in the old property-rights rhetoric. Privacy emerged as a distinct constitutional right only in 1965, in the landmark Supreme Court decision, Griswold v. Connecticut Justice William O. Douglas found in the "penumbras" of the Constitution, "a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights" protecting the "intimate relation of hus- band and wife" from state interference. In 1972, the Court extended the right beyond the family and elevated it to a full-fledged individual right. The following year, in Roe v. Wade, the Court decided that the right was "broad enough to encompass a wom- an's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy." But, as had happened with property rights, Glendon writes, the high court since then has experienced dif- ficulties "in working out principled limita- tions on a right that seemed for a time to have no bounds." What's wrong with a little exaggeration about individual rights? For one thing, Glendon says, "no one can be an absolutist for all our constitutionally guaranteed rights, because taking any one of them as far as it can go soon brings it into conflict with another." In addition, she says, abso- lutist rhetoric encourages conflict and dis- courages reasoned dialogue. It expresses "our most infantile instincts rather than our potential to be reasonable men and women. A country in which we can do 'anything we want' is not a republic of free people attempting to order their lives to- gether." Nor is it a country in which the responsibilities that must accompany rights get the attention they deserve. FOREIGN POLICY &amp; DEFENSE World Champion For How Long? "The Democratic Moment" by Marc F. Plattner, in Journal of Democracy (Fall 1991), 1101 15th St. N.W., Ste. 200, Washing- ton, D.C. 20005. The liberal democratic ideal is now in the racy's fate, says Plattner, coeditor of the ascendancy around the world - but how Journal of Democracy, depends on long can this happy moment last? Democ- whether a rival postcommunist movement WQ WINTER 1992 11</page><page sequence="6">PERIODICALS appears and can attain enough economic success and popular appeal to challenge it for the world's allegiance. There is bound to be some backsliding into authoritarianism by some of the world's new democracies, Plattner notes. But as great a misfortune as that would be for the people involved, he argues, it would not necessarily mean the end of de- mocracy's global prestige. Even if a major- ity of the new democracies failed, the pre- sumption would still be that liberal democracy is the only form of government suitable for mature nations. "Democracy's preeminence can be seri- ously challenged," Plattner maintains, "only by an ideology with universalist as- pirations that proves capable of coming to power in an economically advanced or militarily powerful nation." Nationalism does not qualify as such an ideology, because it is not universalist. Is- lamic hindamentalism, although "proba- bly the most vital alternative to democracy to be found anywhere today," is unlikely to present a serious global challenge. Conver- sions outside the Islamic world have been few, and Islamic fundamentalism appears unable to serve as the basis for economi- cally or militarily successful regimes. Revolutionary Iran no longer seems "even the Islamic wave of the future." The most likely "seedbeds for the birth of a new antidemocratic ideology," Plattner believes, are the Soviet Union and China. Their size and power, as well as their influence over Eastern Europe and East Asia, respectively, make what hap- pens in those nations crucially important for democracy's future. "The emergence of a military-backed neoauthoritarian re- gime, possibly after a period of chaos or even civil war, may be as likely an out- come as a stable democracy in both [coun- tries] And if such a regime were eco- nomically or militarily successful, it could quickly become an attractive model for other countries in its region and in the world." Developments in Japan and the other noncommunist countries of East Asia also bear watching, Plattner says. Despite the apparent stability of democracy in Japan, the future might lead not to a greater con- vergence with Western-style liberal de- mocracy but to "an increased emphasis on those features that distinguish East Asian societies from the West." A new ideology could gradually evolve, which, he specu- lates, given the "extraordinary economic and technological dynamism of the region, could become extremely attractive to other nations." One other nation holds a key to democ- racy's future, Plattner adds: the United States. "[T]here are many reasons to worry about the political, economic, and cultural health of American democracy," he notes. "A serious social or economic crisis in the United States . . . would have a devastating effect on the fortunes of de- mocracy worldwide." Day of Infamy "The Intelligence Failure of Pearl Harbor" by David Kahn, in Foreign Affairs (Winter 1991-92), 58 East 68th St., New York, N.Y. 10021. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, shocked Americans out of the illusion that they were safely isolated from the rest of the world and prompted U.S. entry into World War II. Some histori- ans have maintained that U.S. intelligence analysts possessed advance information about the attack but failed to understand it. Writers of a more conspiratorial bent have contended that President Franklin D. Roosevelt (or, in a different version, Brit- ish Prime Minister Winston Churchill) learned from his intelligence services that the attack was coming but kept quiet in order to get the United States into the war. For once, however, says Kahn, author of The Codebreakers (1967), things are al- most as simple as they appear. In one of the more serious studies of the question, Pearl Harbor: Warning and Deci- sion (1962), Roberta Wohlstetter claimed that U.S. intelligence analysts failed to WQ WINTER 1992 12</page><page sequence="7">PERIODICALS anticipate the attack "not for want of the relevant materials, but because of a pleth- ora of irrelevant ones." The "noise" of ex- traneous information, in other words, drowned out the "signal" of useful clues. In reality, Kahn states, there was a dearth of intelligence materials. "Not one [diplo- matic or naval] intercept, not one datum of intelligence ever said a thing about an attack on Pearl Harbor." Some critics, including Admiral Hus- band Kimmel, the naval commander at Pearl, have found it hard to reconcile the complete surprise of the attack with the fact that U.S. ciyptanalysts in September 1940 had scored a great triumph: They cracked the Empire of Japan's most secret diplomatic cipher. The Americans dubbed it PURPLE. In the succeeding months, the intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages corroborated other evidence that a crisis was approaching. On July 31, 1941, for ex- ample, the foreign minister in Tokyo told Japan's ambassador in Washington that "There is more reason than ever before for us to arm ourselves to the teeth for all-out war." But, Kahn points out, "the Japanese diplomatic PURPLE and other intercepts did not reveal military or naval plans. The [U.S.] Army had not solved any Japanese army codes because it could not intercept enough messages. The Navy had made scant progress on the main Japanese oper- ations code " After Pearl Harbor, Kahn notes, U.S. codebreaking played a vital role in the Al- lied war effort. The cracking of Japanese naval codes made possible "three critical American victories: the battle of Midway, the midair assassination of Japan's leading strategist and architect of the Pearl Harbor attack, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, and the strangling of the island empire through the sinking of its merchant marine." Brit- ish-American exploitation of the German Enigma cipher machine helped defeat Germany's U-boats and land forces. And the breaking of PURPLE "later yielded astonishing insights into Hitler's plans, gleaned from the messages of the Japanese ambassador in Berlin." All that hastened the war's end, but the Allies had no knowl- edge that could have averted the tragedy at Pearl Harbor. Why Nukes Will Not Spread "Winning the Nonproliferation Battle" by Thomas W. Graham, in Arms Control Today (Sept. 1991), 11 Dupont Cir., Washing- ton, D.C. 20036. Stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons now seems more urgent than ever. In recent months, the United States has been trying to prevent North Korea from joining the nuclear club, and it has pressured China and India not to sell reac- tors to Iran. Despite such challenges, Gra- ham, a former official at the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency who is now with the University of California's In- stitute on Global Conflict and Cooperation in San Diego, is confident that the spread of nuclear weapons can be halted. Nuclear proliferation, Graham main- tains, is a much less intractable problem than many strategists think. Past efforts to curb it, he points out, "have been ex- tremely successful, especially given the meager resources . . . devoted to the task." Today, outside the five declared nuclear powers, only a relatively small number of "problem countries" have or are close to having nuclear weapons. India, Israel, Pa- kistan, and South Africa, despite formal denials, have either nuclear weapons or the ability to build them within days or weeks. They are de facto nuclear powers. Four other nations - Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan - have the tech- nical capability to build nuclear weapons within just a few years, although none now appears likely to do so. And five nations - Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Ko- rea - seem to desire nuclear weapons, al- though getting them will not be easy. There is no evidence that this list of "problem countries" is growing, Graham says. In fact, many nations that once were considering nuclear efforts - among them, Egypt, Indonesia, Spain, Sweden, and Tur- WQ WINTER 1992 13</page><page sequence="8">PERIODICALS These instructions showing how to trigger a hydrogen bomb were published amid much controversy in 1979. But actually building nuclear weapons remains extremely difficult. key - no longer are. In the mid-1970s, the United States forced South Korea and Tai- wan to reverse their nascent nuclear- weapons programs. In the early 1980s, the United States, using diplomatic pressure on other nations, was able to block Libya from buying nuclear technology abroad. More recently, thanks in part to interna- tional pressure, Argentina and Brazil, which under military rule had been pursu- ing a nuclear-weapons capability for de- cades, brought their nuclear competition to an apparent end. Since the Persian Gulf War, international attention on Iraq has made any effort to rebuild a covert nu- clear-weapon program there extremely difficult. And South Africa, which has signed the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, could become the first former de facto nuclear-weapon state. Some analysts worry that the end of the Cold War could prompt new countries to seek nuclear weapons, but Graham says that such "abstract thinking" ignores the lessons of the past. In almost all cases - Britain and France being notable excep- tions - nations that have "gone nuclear," he says, have done so mainly because they faced "an acute security threat from a nu- clear-armed adversary that also had a sub- stantial conventional military capability." Such a threat, he says, is unlikely to appear in Europe or - unless North Korea goes nuclear - in East Asia. Moreover, building a nuclear bomb is no easy matter. It requires "a wide array of advanced technology, and a huge and ex- pensive industrial infrastructure." The long lead time involved gives outsiders time to cut off needed technology, exert diplomatic pressure, or take covert action to snuff out the nuclear efforts. ECONOMICS, LABOR &amp; BUSINESS Help Wanted? "The Myth of the Coming Labor Shortage" by Lawrence Mishel and Ruy A. Teixeira, in The American Prospect (Fall 1991), P.O. Box 7645, Princeton, N.J. 08543-7645. The United States will soon face a serious labor shortage, with an increasing demand for highly skilled workers and a greatly in- sufficient supply. So concluded Workforce 2000, the oft-quoted 1987 report done by the Hudson Institute for the U.S. Labor De- WQ WINTER 1992 14</page><page sequence="9">PERIODICALS partment. Mishel, research director of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, and Teixeira, a sociologist with the U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Re- search Service, share the Hudson Institute researchers' concerns about American competitiveness - but not their conclu- sions. Workforce 2000 pointed with alarm to the fact that employment in technical and professional occupations, along with ser- vices, is increasing rapidly, while the labor force is growing slowly. It is true, Mishel and Teixeira say, that highly skilled occu- pations are in general growing fastest, but they account for only a small percentage of U.S. jobs. According to Workforce 2000's own data, the top five such occupa- tions, including law, medicine, natural and social science, engineering, and architec- ture, will provide just 6.1 percent of the nation's jobs in the year 2000. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projec- tions, the authors say, indicate that overall pay levels will decrease in the coming years - hardly a sign of galloping demand for higher skills. Meanwhile, the report neglects the ex- pansion of lower-skilled service jobs. Jobs for cooks, waiters, household workers, jan- itors, security guards, and the like will ac- count for nearly one-fourth of net new em- ployment by the year 2000. Will the quality of America's work force be adequate? The authors of Workforce 2000 fretted about the growing number of undereducated women and minorities in the work force. "Only 15 percent of the new entrants to the labor force over the next 13 years will be native white males," they warned. Actually, say Mishel and Teixeira, about one-third of the entrants will be non-Hispanic white males, and an- other third will be non-Hispanic white fe- males. The Hudson researchers reached their striking conclusion by looking at only net new workers, in effect not count- ing those who will fill existing positions. And Workforce 2000's view of women as educationally deficient, Mishel and Teixeira add, "is belied by the fact that young women in the labor force are now more highly educated than men." The real problem with the quality of the work force, as Mishel and Teixeira see it, has to do with education and training. It's not that the quality of U.S. education has declined, but rather that, with increased international competition, it stacks up poorly against the education in other ad- vanced countries. 'This is a competitive disadvantage that should be addressed," they say, "but it is a problem of the entire work force" - not just of new workers. Another Bill For S&amp;Ls "S&amp;L Borrowing Raised Interest Rates" in The NBER Digest (Sept. 1991), National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc., 1050 Mass. Ave., Cambridge, Mass. 02138. Bills for the savings-and-loan disaster of the late 1980s keep turning up like un- wanted relatives. The latest: higher interest rates before the crisis hit. Between 1926 and '81, report econo- mists John B. Shoven of Stanford, Scott B. Smart of Indiana University, and Joel Waldfogel of Yale, the average real interest rate on short-term Treasury bills was only 0.1 percent; but during the 1980s, it was 4.7 percent. Huge federal deficits, tight monetary policy, and people's slowness to adjust to the sharp drop in inflation were partly to blame. But the three economists say that the thrifts' thirst for cash also con- tributed. Lax federal regulation led many troubled S&amp;Ls to undertake risky invest- ments, financed by issuing high-interest certificates of deposit. Consumers, reas- sured by federal deposit insurance, snapped them up. Faced with this compe- tition for credit, the federal government was forced to raise interest rates on Trea- sury securities. That probably forced up Treasury interest rates by a full percentage point, the authors estimate. The result: Washington paid as much as $146 billion extra in interest during the 1980s. That amount is larger than the en- tire federal deficit in 1982. WQ WINTER 1992 15</page><page sequence="10">PERIODICALS Those Who Can't . . .

"Well, it's all gone, but we had a hell of a good time spending it!" Thomas Edison (1847-1931) exclaimed after losing his light bulb fortune in 1900 on a disastrous plan to mine iron magnetically. Henry Ford called his friend the world's greatest inventor and worst businessman, a reputa- tion that has stuck unfairly, in the view of Millard, a professor at the University of Al- abama, Birmingham. Edison, he says, pio- neered many management techniques that are still in use today. The inventor soon bounced back from his iron mining flop and rebuilt his empire around two new creations, phonographs and movie cameras. Unlike other inven- tors, Edison was not content merely to pat- ent his ideas and then sit back and watch the money roll in. From the beginning, he saw that the future lay in organized re- search and manufacturing. His "invention factory" in Menlo Park, New Jersey, cre- ated in 1876, served as the model for the modern industrial-research laboratory, now followed by major corporations from Standard Oil to Sony. In 1886, Edison expanded to a new lab- oratory in West Orange, New Jersey. He wanted to concentrate on mass produc- tion and marketing, and rightly predicted surging demand for such consumer goods as sewing machines and electric fans. Dur- ing these years, Edison made product di- versity his company's main goal, working on hundreds of different projects at once.

This divisional structure "became the standard of business organization in the 20th century," starting with General Motors and DuPont. Unfortunately, says Millard, "Although TAE Inc.'s divisional structure was years ahead of its time, Edison remained firmly committed to personal leadership in the mold of the 19th-century family business." His control al- but it took only one success to pay for all the failures, notes Millard. Once a product showed signs of success, Edison moved quickly. By 1910, Thomas A.

Edison died in 1931, but thanks to his strategy of diversification, his company weathered the Great Depression. His reputation for busi- ness acumen, however, did not. SOCIETY Why Infants Die "America's Infant-Mortality Puzzle" by Nicholas Eberstadt, in The Public Interest (Fall 1991), 1112 16th St. N.W., Ste. 530, Washington, D.C. 20036. One of America's great shames is its un- usually high infant-mortality rate. Al- though the rate has been steadily declining for many years (from 12.6 deaths per 1,000 infants in 1980 to 9.1 in 1990), it is still much higher than in other developed na- tions, notes Eberstadt, a researcher with the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies. In 1987, for exam- ple, it was almost 20 percent higher than the rate in Norway, nearly 50 percent higher than in the Netherlands, and twice as high as in Japan. Yes, some countries underreport, Eberstadt says, but Australia and Canada, whose reporting practices are similar to those in this country, also have markedly lower infant-mortality rates. Poverty, the chief culprit in most analyses, is not the real problem, Eber- stadt finds. According to one study, for ex- ample, child-poverty rates in Australia and the United States were virtually identical WQ WINTER 1992 136</page><page sequence="12">PERIODICALS in 1980, yet the U.S. infant-mortality rate was nearly one-fifth higher. The explana- tion also does not appear to be inadequate health care. At any given birth weight, he notes, American infants have a higher sur- vival rate than do Japanese or Norwegian babies. The problem is that Americans, white as well as black, have a high inci- dence of risky, low-weight births. Some argue that biology may be a fac- tor, since the proportion of low-birth- weight babies born to blacks is roughly twice as high as for whites. But Eberstadt blames irresponsible parental attitudes and behavior. A 1982 survey by the Na- tional Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) found that low birth weight has a much lower correlation with poverty than with heavy smoking by pregnant women. Ba- bies born to mothers who smoked 15 or more cigarettes a day had an incidence of low birth weight three times greater than those born to nonsmokers. Bearing a child out of wedlock is an- other symptom of irresponsibility, Eber- stadt notes, and it too significantly reduces an American child's chances of survival. A college-educated woman who bore an il- legitimate child in 1982, for example, was more likely to lose her baby within a year than was even a grade-school dropout who was married. If the parents' attitudes and behavior are important in determining infants' chances of surviving, Eberstadt concludes, then the prospects for bringing down the infant- mortality rate through government action may not be very good. The Liberation Of 'White Trash' "Poor Whites in the Occupied South, 1861-1865" by Stephen V. Ash, in The Journal of Southern History (Feb. 1991), Rice Univ., P.O. Box 1892, Houston, Texas 77251. Although American historians have lav- ished attention on the freeing of the slaves during the Civil War, they have virtually ignored the fact that the North's conquest also "began the liberation" of the South's poor whites, writes Ash, an historian at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The antebellum South's impoverished whites were mostly agricultural folk - ten- ant farmers, overseers for large planters, hired hands on yeoman farms, and squat- ters "who eked out a bare existence on the unclaimed lands of the piney woods, the sand hills, the swamps, or the mountains." Their patrician betters looked down on them as "poor white trash," devoid of honor and little better than slaves. In the eyes of the Union soldiers who marched into Dixie, however, the poor whites seemed, at first glance, to be oppressed wretches eagerly awaiting deliverance. Many poor whites did welcome the northern soldiers as liberators. The num- ber of whites who fled to the Yankees may well have equaled or exceeded the num- ber who sought sanctuary behind Rebel lines. A Yankee general leading his troops through hill country in Tennessee in 1863 wrote that poor white men who had been hiding from Confederate conscription "rushed into the road and joined our col- umn, expressing the greatest delight at our coming." Some poor whites enlisted in Union armies. For most of the impoverished, simple survival was the main concern, but many nevertheless became determined to seize the opportunity afforded by invasion and occupation to better their lot. "Some set- tled temporarily in refugee camps and then went north to work," Ash writes. "Others found employment on plantations recently deserted by slaves. But many had a more ambitious goal: securing land of their own. Without federal assistance or encouragement, poor whites in consider- able numbers began occupying aban- doned land in and near Union lines." Like the newly emancipated slaves, the poor whites "defied their oppres- sors . . . and voted with their feet for liberty and opportunity." For a moment, Ash says, "white society in the South seemed to stand on the brink of vast upheaval." But the moment passed and poor whites' mili- tancy ebbed.

Historians, he argues, must rediscover their muse. The tension between popular historians and the arbiters of professional decorum is itself ancient history. Many of the most enduring historians - Voltaire, Gibbon, Macaulay, Car- lyle and Trevelyan - wrote not just outside the academy but in self- conscious defiance of it For all these writers, history was not a remote and funereal place. It was a world that spoke loudly and urgently to our own concerns. How can their sense of the dra- matic immediacy [of the past] be revived? In the first place, history needs to be liberated from its captivity in the school curriculum, where it is held hostage by that great amorphous, utilitarian discipline called social studies. History needs to declare itself unapologeti- cally for what it is: the study of the past in all its splendid messiness. It should revel in the past- ness of the past, the strange music of its dic- tion G. M. Trevelyan put it best: "The poetry of history lies in the quasi-miraculous fact that once, on this earth, on this familiar spot of ground walked other men and women as ac- tual as we are today, thinking their qjivn thoughts, swayed by their own passions but now all gone, vanishing after another, gone as utterly as we ourselves shall be gone tike ghosts at cockcrow." . . . History is an indispensable form of human self-knowledge History's mission . . .is to illuminate the human condition from the wit- ness of memory. Yet the truths likely to be yielded by such histories will al- ways be closer to those disclosed in great novels or poems than the ab- stract general laws sought by social scien- tists. To this end, the . . . pressing task [is to restore] history to the forms by which it can catch the public imagina- tion. That form, as Ken Burns' s stunning PBS se- ries on the Civil War demonstrated, ought to be narrative; not to dis- card argument and anal- ysis, but to lend it proper dramatic and poetic power. Appomattox Court House in April 1865, meant, ironically, a resurgence of south- ern aristocrats' authority in Union-occu- pied regions. They soon did their best to put the poor whites, as well as the newly freed slaves, back in their places. Seduction or Date Rape? "Rape in Feminist Eyes" by Norman Podhoretz, in Commentary (Oct. 1991), 165 E. 56th St., New York, N.Y. 10022. In the space of a few years, "date rape" has emerged as a major national concern, dis- cussed in campus seminars and on TV talk shows. This, says Podhoretz, Commentary's editor-in-chief, is a great victory for a femi- nist campaign to redefine seduction as rape and thus to brand nearly all men as rapists. For millennia, he points out, there was no question about the definition of rape. It occurred when a man used violence or the threat of it to force a woman into sex. WQ WINTER 1992 138</page><page sequence="14">PERIODICALS Rape has always been viewed as one of the most abhorrent of crimes. The new cate- gory of date or acquaintance rape expands the definition to cover a multitude of situa- tions in which, as the editors of Acquaint- ance Rape: The Hidden Crime (1991) put it, "verbal or psychological coercion" is used to "overpower" the woman. Over- coming a woman's resistance with words, Podhoretz observes, "has in the past been universally known as seduction." But to many feminists, he says, "a wom- an's no always means no, her maybe al- ways means no, and even . . . her yes often means no." Harvard Law School's Susan Estrich says: "Many feminists would argue that so long as women are powerless rela- tive to men, viewing 'yes' as a sign of true consent is misguided." Why have the front lines of the war be- tween the sexes been stretched so far? Podhoretz believes that feminism emerged in reaction to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, in which women shed many tradi- tional feminine prerogatives along with their inhibitions. "Wanting to say no again but having signed on to an ideology that deprived them of any reason or right to say it, women were desperately looking for a way back that would not seem regressive or reactionary." They found it in the move- ment for women's liberation and the be- lated discovery that the sexual revolution had been just "another in the long history of male conspiracies to degrade and domi- nate women." From there it was but a short step to "the conclusion that sex it- self - heterosexual sex, that is - was the mother (or rather the father) of all these conspiracies." Shunning men altogether being too radical a solution for most femi- nists, they adopted the seemingly more moderate objective of working toward "a wholesale change" in the relation between the sexes. In the new sexual dispensation, women would call the shots. Hence, "any instance of heterosexual coupling that starts with male initiative and involves even the slightest degree of female resis- tance at any stage along the way" was deemed illegitimate. But the "date-rape" campaign, in Podhoretz's view, faces a formidable ene- my: Mother Nature. Most young men and most young women still will play "their naturally ordained parts in the unending and inescapable war between the sexes, suffering the usual wounds, exulting in the usual victories, and even eventually arriv- ing at that armistice known as marriage." PRESS &amp; MEDIA News We Can't Use "Why the News Makes Us Dumb" by John Sommerville, in First Things (Oct. 1991), Inst. on Religion and Public Life, 156 Fifth Ave., Ste. 400, New York, N.Y. 10010. Journalists often bemoan the fact that Americans do not seem as interested in the news as they once were. Probably only about one-quarter of those under 35, ac- cording to a 1990 survey, read yesterday's paper. Sommerville, a University of Flor- ida historian, is unmoved. The whole idea of "news" that must be ingested daily, he argues, is deeply flawed. The "news," Sommerville points out, is only "what has happened since yesterday's paper or broadcast." Yet when informa- tion is sold on a daily basis, each day's re- port must be made to seem vitally impor- tant - even when, as is often the case, it is ephemeral. Today's news is made to seem significant mainly by reducing the impor- tance of yesterday's - the historical con- text of events. USA Today, with its bite-sized stories, colorful charts, and obsession with. celeb- rities and factoids, has often been con- demned for trivializing journalism. In real- ity, he argues, it just accelerates existing trends. USA Today shows that news is "a concentration on the ephemeral - the flot- sam and foam on the surface of history." There is no room in news reports for WQ WINTER 1992 139</page><page sequence="15">PERIODICALS "real thinking," he says. "So news is made up of statements rather than arguments." In place of genuine debate, the news offers just a clash of opinions. "As a result, we forget how to carry on a debate, and fall back on polls." A "flippant relativism," in which truth is lost to view, is encouraged by the "evenhandedness" of the news, he contends. "The idea that all 'viewpoints' are somehow equal is the reason that we do so badly in arguing our great social is- sues." Yet at the same time, the news me- dia - in the absence of any agreed upon scale of values - may arbitrarily make some particular value or cause, such as helping the homeless, supremely impor- tant. But only for the moment. Tomor- row's news is almost sure to bring feome newer and more urgent concern. The "news," at bottom, is anything that Booboisie Media Novelist and wit Gore Vidal, writing in the Nation (Aug. 26- Sept. 2, 1991), not only finds much to admire in journalist H. L. Mencken (1880-1956), but thinks he had a keen un- derstanding of the mass audience. Mencken* s ideal popular paper for that vast public that "gets all its news by listening" (today one would change "listen- ing" to "staring" - at television) would be "printed through- out, as First Readers are printed, in words of one syllable. It should avoid every idea that is beyond the understanding of a boy of 10" on the ground that "all ideas are beyond them. They can grasp only events." But they will heed only those events that are presented as drama in "the form of combat, and it must be a very simple combat, with one side clearly right and the other clearly wrong. They can no more imagine neutrality than they can imagine the fourth dimension." Thus Mencken anticipates not only the television news pro- gram but the television political campaign, with its combat- ive 30-second commercials and soundbites. Movies were al- ready showing the way, and Mencken acknowledged the wisdom of the early movie magnates, whose simple-minded screened agons had made them rich Today, Mencken's boisterous style and deadpan hyper- boles are very difficult even for "educated" Americans to deal with, and are Sanskrit to the generality. Although every American has a sense of humor - it is his birthright and en- coded somewhere in the Constitution - few Americans have ever been able to cope with wit or irony, and even the sim- plest jokes often cause unease, especially today when every phrase must be examined for covert sexism, racism, ageism. sells newspapers. In the past, however, Sommerville says, editors "took a more high-handed approach and gave the public what they thought grown-up, serious- minded people would want to know about." Today's newspeople have wised up. They know "that deep down, we don't care if our daily news is entirely au- thentic so long as it is enter- taining - like pro wres- tling." The National Enquirer, he believes, shows where even the most respectable newspapers are headed. Are Americans who have ceased distracting them- selves with the "news" de- voting their attention in- stead to more substantive subjects, such as philoso- phy, history, or religion? Sommerville is doubtful. "[T]he damage our spirits have sustained through news addiction makes it un- likely. But the first step back to health is still to Just Say No." The TV Teacher "As the Third World Turns" by Erik Hagerman, in World Watch (Sept.-Oct. 1991), 1776 Mass. Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. A famous Shakespeare scholar, upon being told that he was expected to teach a gradu- ate seminar every Wednesday evening, stared at his young department chairman in disbelief and said, "Sir, surely there's been some mistake? Wednesday night is Dynasty night." The story may be apocryphal, but no WQ WINTER 1992 140</page><page sequence="16">PERIODICALS matter: The point is that soap operas are notoriously addictive. In the Third World, a growing number of family-planning ad- vocates are counting on just that. In the last decade, the number of televi- sion receivers in Third World homes has doubled (to 350 million, or one for every 12 people), turning television into a major force. The idea of using TV drama to pro- mote family planning was born in 1977, when Miguel Sabido, a producer at a com- mercial Mexican network, created a soap opera that dramatized the need for birth control. "Accompâname" ("Come Along With Me"), according to the network's fol- low-up survey, "was one of the chief rea- sons for a 32-percent increase in visits to Mexican family-planning clinics in 1978," writes Hagerman, a researcher at a Wash- ington-based environmental think tank, the Worldwatch Institute. Sabido's idea found its way to Nigeria, where the birth control message was inte- grated into a popular TV show. Visits to family-planning clinics rose by 47 percent, and almost two-thirds of the new clients credited the program as the catalyst for their visits. Other countries have since begun to use television to promote family planning and other social causes, including several Latin Vasectomies increased in Brazil after a pro-va- sectomy TV spot featuring animated "male*' and "female" hearts was aired in 1989. American countries, Kenya, Turkey, and India. In the Philippines, to encourage sex- ual responsibility among young people, a U.S.-Philippine coalition of population- control groups organized a campaign around music videos. Many of these early efforts have been made by government-sponsored or gov- ernment-owned networks, and Hagerman worries that advertisers will corrupt any future attempt to broaden them. That gov- ernments may be tempted to use TV for less politically correct propaganda appears not to bother him at all. RELIGION &amp; PHILOSOPHY When Politics Became a Science "Aristotelianism and the Origins of 'Political Science' in the Twelfth Century" by Cary J. Nederman, in Journal of the History of Ideas (Apr. -June 1991), Univ. of Rochester, Rochester, N.Y. 14627. Scholars regard the rediscovery of Aris- totle's Politics in the mid- 13th century as the spark that ignited an intellectual revo- lution. Medieval political thought gave way to modern forms, eventually including Ma- chiavellian amoralism, as the realm of politics was defined for the first time as a branch of knowledge separate from theol- ogy, law, and other fields. In a curious way, says Nederman, of the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, Aristotle's influ- ence was even greater than scholars have commonly supposed. Although thinkers in the 12th century did not enjoy direct access to Aristotle's text, Nederman says, they did read works such as Boethius's Commentary on Porphy- ry's Isagoge and Cassiodorus's Institutes that propounded the Aristotelian scheme of classification of the sciences and the place of political inquiry within it. Many 12th-century thinkers, he says, not only recognized "that politics was a separate and distinct subject matter for inquiry but WQ WINTER 1992 141</page><page sequence="17">PERIODICALS they also sometimes attempted to specu- late more generally on the nature of the political realm itself " The monk Hugh of St. Victor saw in his Didascalion of the late 1 120s, according to Nederman, that "where ethics treats of personal virtue and economics of the ma- terial circumstances of the household, politics is concerned with its own special end, namely, the good of the public sphere. The study of politics thus requires different principles and yields different sorts of conclusions " And in John of Salisbury's Policraticus (1159), a central assumption, notes Nederman, is that "po- litical questions may be treated in separa- tion from moral and theological issues, even if there exists an ultimate intercon- nection among them." If the Latin translation and circulation of Aristotle's Politics about 1250 thus really had no revolutionary impact on medieval thinking, that is not because Aristotle's ideas had no effect. On the contrary, Nederman says, his thought "exercised a far more pervasive influence upon philo- sophical inquiry into politics during the Middle Ages than has hitherto been sus- pected." The lessons of Aristotle's Politics were readily absorbed after 1250, not be- cause they were new but because they re- inforced existing beliefs. Thp T îmîtç ni "On Toleration and Tolerance" by Maurice Cranston, in Quad- 1 ric l^iruuo uj ^^ (Mar 1991) 46 George St FitzrOyf Victoria, 3065, Austra- Toleration i». Voltaire (1694-1778), battling religious ex- tremism in France but lacking any influ- ence on government or politicians, sought to persuade his countrymen to exercise more personal tolerance. English philoso- pher John Locke (1632-1704), by contrast, championed toleration as public policy - but thought it had limits. Locke's biogra- pher, Maurice Cranston, believes that both men's views are relevant today. A revival of anti-Protestant fanaticism among French Catholics - "not entirely unlike the fanaticism we observe in Islam today," Cranston says - prompted the el- derly Voltaire to write his Treatise on Tol- erance (1763). Posing in the work as an obedient Catholic, Voltaire argued that man is unable fully to understand events in his own life, let alone know the mind of God. As no church can prove it has the true religion, it is best to put up with the other sects, however mistaken they may seem. Voltaire hoped to change people's attitudes, and in that way "to shame their rulers, and especially the religious authori- ties, out of the practice of persecution," Cranston writes. Locke, on the other hand, appealed di- rectly to government leaders. In a paper he wrote in 1677 for the Whig leader, the first Earl of Shaftesbury, the philosopher argued that all Protestant dissenters should be tolerated because their beliefs and forms of worship, however offensive to England's ruling Anglicans, did not dis- turb the nation's tranquillity. Roman Cath- olics, however, were another matter, Locke insisted. England was being brought to the edge of civil war by the question of whether King Charles II's Roman Catholic brother, James, should be allowed to ac- cede to the throne in the event of Charles' death. Catholics, Locke claimed, did not merit official toleration because their opinions were "destructive of all govern- ments except the Pope's." They were, in effect, a subversive political movement. Today, Cranston maintains, "[T]he Is- lamic faith has become the sort of subver- sive positive force, and menace, that the Catholic church was, rightly or wrongly, in Locke's eyes." The death sentence im- posed on novelist Salman Rushdie by the Ayatollah Khomeini and "accepted as authoritative by the Muslims living in Eng- land," Cranston says, provides "an exam- ple of what Locke called 'obedience to a foreign prince.'" Muslim leaders in Eng- land have even demanded a separate par- liament. In these circumstances, Cranston says, Locke's message, as well as that of Voltaire, remains pertinent. "We must cul- WQ WINTER 1992 142</page><page sequence="18">PERIODICALS tivate the spirit of tolerance in our hearts; but we should not allow the policy of tol- eration to be exploited and abused by fanatical sectarian groups which are sub- versive political movements in ecclesiasti- cal disguise." Religion As Therapy "Saving Therapy: Exploring the Religious Self-Help Literature" by Wendy Kaminer, in Theology Today (Oct. 1991), P.O. Box 29, Princeton, N.J. 08542. Millions of Americans read religious self- help books. M. Scott Peck's first tome, The Road Less Traveled (1978), was on the best-seller list for years, and works by such authors as Charles (Grace Awakening) Swindoll and Gordon (Renewing Your Spiritual Passion) MacDonald also have worldwide audiences. Such books, reports Kaminer, a lawyer and visiting scholar at Radcliffe, "are marketed as primers on personality development and psychother- apy, child rearing, spouse abuse, depres- sion, and despair, as well as the search for love, happiness, and salvation." The books portray God as a loving parent, and advise readers to acknowledge their dependence on Him, to reject individualism, and to love themselves as well as their neighbors. Nineteenth-century liberal Protestant- ism, for all its faults, at least encouraged people to act to shape their environments, Kaminer says. "Now popular religion, like a 12-step [recovery] group, [tells] us that we're powerless." Most of the pop reli- gious literature is devoid of "thoughtful discussion of moral behavior." The writers provide "a laundry list of moral wrongs - abortion, homosexuality, adultery, athe- ism, and rebellion - but no guidance in re- solving moral dilemmas." The writers usually "claim a fellowship with their readers, admitting their own fal- lacies, sins, and neuroses." MacDonald de- votes a whole book to his own repentance of adultery. But they also set themselves up as authorities, even as they disclaim any higher expertise. Peck, for example, "be- moans our tendency to 'let our authorities do our thinking for us,'" but clearly re- gards himself as an authority. He specu- lates that people who "slip away" from his workshops "just cannot bear that much love." Individuals who challenge him, Kaminer says, are almost always presented in his books as wrong. Peck and the other Protestant writers all stress strongly the need to surrender one's self to God. Peck maintains that "only two states of being [exist]: submission to God and goodness or the refusal to submit to anything beyond one's own will, which re- fusal automatically enslaves one to the forces of evil" - a proposition Kaminer finds "chilling." In people's "eagerness to submit," she remarks, "not everyone can distinguish God from the devil." SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENT Crying No Wolf "Biodiversity Studies: Science and Policy" by Paul R. Ehrlich and Edward O. Wilson, and "Extinction: Are Ecologists Crying Wolf?" by Charles C. Mann, in Science (Aug. 16, 1991), Ameri- can Assoc. for the Advancement of Science, 1333 H St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005. Ecocatastrophe is not too strong a word for the specter raised by biologists Paul Ehrlich of Stanford and Edward Wilson of Harvard. The destruction of tropical rain forests and other natural habitats, they as- sert, is accelerating the extinction of pre- cious species of animals, plants, and mi- croorganisms. Tropical deforestation alone, they calculate, now causes the loss of at least .2 percent of all species in the WQ WINTER 1992 143</page><page sequence="19">PERIODICALS forests annually - a loss of 4,000 species per year if there are 2 million in the for- ests, and 40,000 if there are 20 million. Biodiversity is important for more than moral and aesthetic reasons, they say; it provides "enormous direct economic benefits ... in the form of foods, medi- cines, and industrial products." To save "our fellow living creatures and ourselves in the long run," Ehrlich and Wilson pro- pose a radical worldwide ban on the devel- opment of "relatively undisturbed" land. That would require massive aid for the Third World and a "cooperative world- wide effort unprecedented in history." But some scientists, reports freelance writer Charles Mann, aren't so sure that ecological doomsday is just around the corner. To begin with, nobody even knows how many species there are. Ehrlich and Wil- son say the number might be 100 million. But scientists have actually identified only 1.4 million. That, writes Mann, puts doomsday prophets "in the awkward posi- tion of predicting the imminent demise of huge numbers of species nobody has ever seen." Moreover, Ehrlich and Wilson's extinc- tion rates are based on the assumption that habitats are like islands; as the island shrinks, parts of the habitat and some of the species in it are utterly lost. But the analogy is imperfect. Habitats only roughly resemble islands. One study showed that almost half of the more than 1 1 million hectares of virgin tropical forest cut each year did not become wasteland (i.e. "wa- ter" around the "island") but secondary forest that still supported some plant and animal life. It does not support as much biodiversity as virgin forest, but it is not necessarily barren, either. The assumed relationship between an area available for wild populations and the number of species that area can support also runs into criticism from some scien- tists. A loss of area, they say, may reduce just the extent - not the diversity - of an ecosystem. Some of today's habitat de- struction may not translate into any loss of species. The experience of Puerto Rico, one of the few tropical places where long-term biological records have been kept, gives further reason to doubt the doomsayers, Mann says. The island, now thickly cov- ered with trees, "was almost completely stripped of virgin forest at the turn of the century. Yet it did not suffer massive ex- tinctions." Of 60 bird species, for example, only seven disappeared. This was a "pain- ful" loss, he observes, but not "an ecoca- tastrophe." Fudging Or Fraud? "Scientific Fraud" by David Goodstein, in The American Scholar (Autumn 1991), 1811 Q St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009. In yet another highly publicized case of scientific fraud, Nobel Prize-winning biolo- gist David Baltimore finally conceded last spring that a paper on transgenic mice he had been defending for five years might well contain false data concocted by a co- worker. The revelation gave more ammu- nition to politicians and journalists who contend that fraud in science is more com- mon than we think. Even some scientists have begun to have doubts. Caltech physi- cist David Goodstein replies that science, like other areas of human activity, has lit- tle "hypocrisies and misrepresentations" built into the way it is done. They should not be confused with fraud. Journalists William Broad and Nicholas Wade fell into that trap in their 1982 book, Betrayers of the Truth. Among the scien- tists they implicated in "Known or Sus- pected Cases of Fraud" were Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and American physi- cist Robert A. Millikan (1868-1953). Newton was trying to explain the propa- gation of sound waves in air. His theory, Goodstein says, "was so good he was able to calculate the speed of sound and then compare it with measurements. When he did, they disagreed by about 20 percent." Although this represented a great intellec- WQ WINTER 1992 144</page><page sequence="20">PERIODICALS Environmentalism's Limits to Growth A Survey of Recent Articles Greenpeace 20 years ago was just the name that a small band of activists in Vancouver, British Columbia, gave to an old fishing ves- sel they used in a failed attempt to block a U.S. nuclear-bomb test. Today, reports Tom Horton in Rolling Stone (Sept. 5, 1991), Greenpeace is the world's largest and wealthiest environmental organization - "a rich, planet-saving, lawbreaking, in-your- face, semi-anarchistic, multinational cor- poration." But for Greenpeace, as for other, less radical, environmental groups, growth and success have brought their own special problems. Based in Amsterdam, Greenpeace now has offices in 23 nations, projected revenues for 1991 of $160 million, and nearly five mil- lion contributors, half of them in the United States. It has a satellite communications net- work (Greenlink) and a companion database (Greenbase). It has a fleet of eight imposing ships. It even has a small diplomatic corps of specialists in international law and foreign policy, who represent the organization in treaty conferences and conventions that reg- ulate such activities as whaling and ocean dumping. Yet Greenpeace, Horton writes, is now "in a state of turmoil about its future, agonizing over whether success has dulled its cutting edge. Is it poised to become a truly global force ... or is it in grave danger of becoming overextended? Is it becoming too comfort- able and bureaucratic to take the risks that have been Greenpeace's stock in trade?" The organization built its radical reputa- tion with dangerous confrontational stunts. In 1985, Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior, on a voyage to protest French nuclear tests in the South Pacific, was sunk in New Zealand by French-government agents, and one ac- tivist was killed. Recently, however, Greenpeace refused to endorse a boycott of tuna canners to protest the slaughter of dol- phins caught in tuna fishermen's nets. Greenpeace held back, Horton says, because of its efforts to expand into Latin America, which depends on tuna exports for precious hard currency. (Even so, after large U.S. tuna canners agreed to market only "dol- phin-safe" tuna, Greenpeace reportedly tried to claim credit.) Steve Sawyer, executive di- rector of Greenpeace International, told Horton: "Yes, life is more complicated when you look at the whole world, but that's what Greenpeace has to do now." Other environmental organizations also have been facing the dilemmas of growth. The rising popularity that many of them ex- perienced during the 1980s, Newsweek* s (June 24, 1991) Sharon Begley observes, "brought a huge influx of members and do- nations, saddling the groups with gargan- tuan overheads and staffs." The recession has forced some groups to cut back. The Na- tional Wildlife Federation, for instance, laid off 56 employees - seven percent of its staff- early in 1991, Outside's (July 1991) Bill Gifford notes. Expansion can lead to more than just fi- nancial woes. It also can mean a weakening of the special purpose for which the organi- zation was set up. "The National Audubon Society used to be the strongest organization protecting birds and wildlife, and now it is not," Roger Tory Peterson, the well-known writer and painter of birds told Dyan Zaslowsky in Harrowsmith Country Life (Sept.-Oct. 1991). The 87-year-old society used to concentrate on such traditional con- servationist activities as running bird sanc- tuaries, taking bird censuses, and leading ef- forts to save birds from extinction. But now, Peterson said, "It is deemphasizing nature and emphasizing trash and pollution be- cause it just wants to grow larger. John James Audubon would be absolutely bewil- dered by it." Peter A. A. Berle, president of the Audu- bon society, contends in Audubon (May 1991) that "Today nature is defined by hu- man activity." Since he became the society's head in 1985, Zaslowsky reports, Berle "has involved the organization in the gamut of ecological causes." The elegant egret that had long been the society's symbol was re- placed in 1991 by a small blue flag. The environmental movement, declares former Audubon editor Les line, fired by Berle after 25 years in the job, is "now more interested in collecting garbage and putting a brick in the toilet than in examining na- ture. The naturalists have been replaced by ecocrats who are more comfortable on Cap- itol Hill than in the woods, fields, meadows, mountains, and swamps."

And so he "came up with all kinds of arguments . . . now known to be wrong." He "made little fixes'1- e.g., hy- pothesizing that there was water vapor in the air that for some reason affected sound waves - "until he finally got his theory in agreement with the experiment." Newton was not behaving very differently from theorists today, Goodstein says. "In hind- sight, Newton's fixes are funny and his mo- tive revealing." But they do not add up to fraud. Millikan was measuring the electric charges of drops of oil. He wanted to prove the charges came in definite units; a rival scientist contended otherwise and criticized Millikan's results. Millikan went back to his lab to get better data and later published a paper in which he claimed to be providing the data from all the -drops observed. In fact, Millikan's notebooks show that he had not published everything. Data on drops that didn't fit his theory had been left out. "Millikan did not simply throw away drops he didn't like," Good- stein notes. "That would have been fraud by any scientist's standard. To discard a drop, he had to find some mistake that would invalidate that datum." So he did. It Piltdown man provided science with a "missing link*' - until 1954, when it was exposed as a fake.

The fine line between "harmless fudging" and real fraud is an important one, Goodstein maintains. If the work, and everything that flowed from it, of New- ton, Millikan, Ptolemy, Hip- parchus of Rhodes, Galileo, John Dalton, and Gregor Mendel - all accused by Broad and Wade of involve- ment in cases of fraud - were expunged from the body of scientific knowl- edge, "there would not be much left." How to Limit Population Growth "Conspicuous Benevolence and the Population Bomb" by Gar- rett Hardin, in Chronicles (Oct. 1991), The Rockford Inst, 934 N. Main St., Rockford, 111. 61103. The world's population is increasing by a quarter of a million people every day. Population-control advocates demand a global solution to what they see as a global crisis. But efforts to impose communal control on the fertility of parents keep run- ning up against the European tradition of individual freedom and religious princi- ples (Catholic and Hindu), not to mention the simple reluctance of many people the world over to limit family size to 2.3 chil- dren. No way out of this dilemma has been found. But Garrett Hardin, author of the seminal 1968 essay, "The Tragedy of the Commons," says that even in the absence of a "total answer," progress can be made. Hardin, a professor emeritus of human ecology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, recommends "the incre- mental approach, adopting partial mea- sures that will slow the population growth, giving us more time to look for more gen- eral solutions." Fortunately, he says, the world is divided into nearly 200 nations: WQ WINTER 1992 146</page><page sequence="22">PERIODICALS They can all serve as labora- tories in which different ex- periments are carried out. But, he adds, each nation must "experiment only with itself, so it can speedily ob- serve whether an experi- ment is successful or not." For rich nations such as the United States, Hardin contends, "the most feasi- ble partial solution is an im- mediate restriction of immi- gration." Because immigration accounts for about half of the country's [one percent] annual popu- lation growth, he notes, "the potential for progress ... is great." Restricting immigration here, he argues, would also help other nations. "No na- tion that can foist off its ex- tra people onto other na- tions," he says, "is likely to take its population problem seriously."

ARTS &amp; LETTERS Corrupting Rap "The Rap on Rap" by David Samuels, in The New Republic (Nov. 11, 1991), 1220 19th St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. Hailed by many critics as authentic street music and damned by others for the same reason, rap music has taken the country by storm. Last summer, Niggaz4life, a celebra- tion of gang rape and other violence by the group N.W.A., or Niggers With Attitude, was the best-selling record in America. In the past, notes Samuels, a Mellon Fel- low at Princeton, black music (such as jazz and R&amp;B) has been modified to appeal to WQ WINTER 1992 147</page><page sequence="23">PERIODICALS Despite the rap group Public Enemy's militant style, its members grew up not on inner-city streets but in suburban Long Island towns. white audiences. But promoters found a more noxious formula for putting rap on the map. The music's roots are in "toast- ing/' a Jamaican style of music that was born in the mid-1960s. A decade later, lower-class blacks in New York pioneered rap, speaking whimsical lyrics over the heavy beat of "hip-hop" dance music, and it soon spread to other cities. Then, start- ing in the early 1980s, Samuels says, "a tightly knit group of mostly young, middle- class, black New Yorkers, in close concert with white record producers, executives, and publicists, [began] making rap music for an audience . . . primarily composed of white suburban males." Rap's chief impresario, according to Samuels, is Rick Rubin, "a Jewish punk rpcker from suburban Long Island" who masterminded rap's first million-selling al- bum, Licensed to III (1983), by the Beastie Boys, a white punk rock band that Rubin transformed into a rap group. But Samuels writes that Rubin and oth- ers soon found that "the more rappers were packaged as violent black criminals, the bigger their white audiences be- came Rap's appeal to whites rested in its evocation of an age-old image of black- ness: a foreign, sexually charged, and criminal underworld against which the norms of white society are defined, and, by extension, through which they may be de- fied." So Rubin served up Public Enemy, one of a number of groups now offering "a highly charged theater of race in which white listeners became guilty eavesdrop- pers on the putative private conversation of the inner city." Putative because Public Enemy's members are actually the sons of black middle-class professionals who grew up in New York's Long Island suburbs. "A lot of what you see in rap," says Har- vard's Henry Louis Gates, Jr., "is the guilt of the black middle class about its eco- nomic success, its inability to put forth a culture of its own. Instead they do the worst possible thing, falling back on fanta- sies of street life. In turn, white college students . . . buy nasty sex lyrics under the cover of getting at some kind of authentic black experience." Already, Samuels believes, rap's popu- larity among inner-city blacks is waning. But the hit machine grinds on, churning out vastly popular songs and videos that glorify misogyny, anti-Semitism, and racist stereotypes of black criminality - a cor- rupt commerce in which blacks and whites are both complicit. AvPCtltitlCl ^ *S "The Journey to the South: Poe, Borges, and Faulkner" by John ^ f . T. Irwin, in The Virginia Quarterly Review (Summer 1991), One SOUthern f Writer . West Range, Charlottesville, Va. 22903. Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986), whose lu- minous ficciones combine playful meta- physical musings with tight plots, consid- ered "perhaps my best story" to be "The South." It can be read as a straightforward narrative, he said, and also "in another way" - which he did not reveal. Irwin, a professor of humanities at Johns Hopkins, suggests that the story offers a figurative account of the Argentinian's own career as a writer. In "The South," the main character, WQ WINTER 1992 148</page><page sequence="24">PERIODICALS Juan Dahlmann, after an accidental brush with death and his discharge from a sani- tarium, heads for a ranch he has inherited in the south of Argentina. Along the way, he gets into a confrontation with three drunken toughs. An old gaucho - "in whom Dahlmann saw a summary and ci- pher of the South (his South) - threw him a naked dagger, which landed at his feet. It was as if the South had resolved that Dahlmann should accept the duel," one he is fated to lose. The "South" of the story obviously is much more than just the pampas of Argen- tina. And just as the fictional Dahlmann, upon recovering from his accident, jour- neyed to that symbolic region, so Borges on his recovery from a similar accident in 1938 embarked on his career as a writer of fiction. In this parallel journey, Irwin says, Borges's sense of himself as a "south- erner" seeking to move into the realm of North American literature was very impor- tant. At the time, the bookish Borges, who had been educated in Europe, looked to Edgar Allan Poe (1809-49) as "a model of how one could achieve literary self-defini- tion through a kind of antithetical regional identification." Although Poe was born in Boston, he was raised in Virginia and came to consider himself "a Southern gen- tleman, even something of an aristocrat." This distinguished Poe, in his own mind, from "the largely Northern literary estab- lishment in which he moved." Borges, as he immersed himself in North American literature, felt a strong kinship with Poe for other reasons as well. Like Poe (and like the imaginary Dahlmann), Borges had a grandfather who was a military hero, and like Poe, he was early drawn to the military life (although that was impossible for the nearsighted and rather frail Argentinian). The Ameri- can South has a strong military tradition, Irwin notes, and there was in the Civil War an image of the southerner "as the aristo- crat who is both soldier and poet." The first story Borges wrote in 1939, af- ter his near death from blood poisoning, was "Pierre Menard, Author of Don Qui- xote." In it, a minor French poet and essay- ist sets out to produce a new Don Quixote. Just as Menard was seeking to "double" the work of Cervantes (like Poe, a former soldier), so the then-minor poet and essay- ist Borges was trying at the time to "dou- ble" several of Poe's detective stories. Poe's influence, probably reinforced by the work of another eminent writer from the American South whom Borges ad- mired, William Faulkner, sharpened Borges's "sense of his own southernness," Irwin says. By making the most of that, Borges was able to achieve the originality that made him one of the century's great fiction writers. Articles We Never Finished Reading . . . As postmodern ethnography de-familiar- izes the genre of life-writing into a vora- cious apparatus of textualized selfhood, the underlying cultural function of biogra- phy, at least as a Western genre, can be seen to insinuate and extend what James Clifford has called "the myth of coherent personality." That is, by means of a mas- sive life-writing consuming and producing selves from George Washington to Cory Grant and Alice James, the primary func- tion of biography is to disseminate a pleth- ora of selves who might instantiate this in- tegrity of selfhood as achieved against a more or less recessive social background, what Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, and Althusser have theorized (less blithely) as the overdeterminations of mythic structures, libidinal codes, and economic base. Hence, in contracting to document and amass the thematics of such a particular- ized self, the biographer enters the terms of a genre in which he or she contracts to deliver the individual as a tormented jour- ney toward coherent unity, striking personality, and expressive selfhood .... - From "Producing American Selves: The Form of American Biography" by Rob Wilson, in boundary 2 (Summer 1991).

No fewer than 58 individuals have been proposed at one time or another as the true author of the works attributed to Wil- liam Shakespeare (1564-1616) of Strat- ford. The anti-Stratfordians' current favor- ite is Edward de Vere (1550-1604), the 17th Earl of Oxford, a courtier who was a scholar, athlete, and poet. Journalist Tom Bethell contends the available evidence supports their claim, but independent scholar Irvin Matus firmly insists that the plays and sonnets were written by the man from Stratford. In the eyes of anti-Stratfordians, there exists a vast, unbridgeable gap between the apparently unlettered Stratford man and the glorious works that now bear his name. 'To credit that amazing piece of vir- tuosity [Love 's Labour's Lost] to a butcher boy who left school at 13 or even to one whose education was nothing more than what a grammar school and residence in a little provincial borough could provide," declared J. Dover Wilson, editor of the New Cambridge Shakespeare, "is to invite one either to believe in miracles or to dis- believe in the man of Stratford." Two characteristics in the Shakespeare canon, Bethell argues, "suggest powerfully that its author was not a small-town burgh- er [such as Shakespeare] but rather a well- traveled nobleman [such as De Vere]. One is the very attitude. The author displays lit- tle sympathy for the class of upwardly mo- bile strivers of which [the Stratford man] was a preeminent member .... Shake- speare's frequent disgust with court life sounds like the revulsion of a man who knew it too well." Also, Bethell says, there is "the author's apparent knowledge of for- eign lands [It] is implausible that the Stratford man ever went abroad." How- ever, while the man who wrote the plays set in Italy was evidently familiar with its topography, Matus notes that the play- wright's characters "are always of contem- porary England." Matus says that "very little in Shake- speare's plays . . . required knowledge be- yond materials that were publicly avail- able." Formal schooling was not really a necessity. Ben Jonson (1573-1637), for ex- ample, "could not . . . have had much more than a few years of rudimentary schooling before he was put to work, prob- ably at his stepfather's trade, bricklaying. Nevertheless, Jonson would be- come . . . Britain's most admired play- wright in the 17th century" and a leading scholar of the classics. "Evidently," Matus observes, "there may be more to both scholarship and literary genius than a for- mal education." The partisans of De Vere and other can- didates, Matus says, have failed to demon- strate how any of them gained "the inti- mate knowledge and experience of theater and drama to create plays that remain the standard by which all other stage .works are measured. Those qualifications are possessed uniquely by the man who was an active member of an extraordinary the- atrical ensemble - William Shakespeare, gentleman of Stratford." OTHER NATIONS China's Generation Gap "Chinese Youth: The Nineties Generation" by Beverley Hooper, in Current History (Sept. 1991), 4225 Main St., Phila- delphia, Pa. 19127. Since the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989, little news of open dissent by Chinese university students has reached the West. But some young people, reports Hooper, of the Asia Research Center at Murdoch University in Western Australia, WQ WINTER 1992 150</page><page sequence="26">PERIODICALS have found another way to protest: rock music with anti-establishment lyrics. Teen- age rock idol Cui Jian's latest album, "Jiejue" (Resolve), for example, begins with these lines: 'There are many prob- lems before us;/There's no way to resolve them./But the fact that we have never had the chance/Is an even greater problem." Its enthusiasm for defiant rock lyrics, Hooper says, is but one manifestation of the fact that the current generation of Chi- nese youth is openly behaving in ways that run counter to both socialist and tradi- tional Confucian values. The nation's 300 million young people (ages 14-25) constitute one-fourth of the population. With almost no memories of the Maoist cult of austerity, Hooper writes, they have "taken to consumer culture with a vengeance." The youths' spare yuan have attracted both local manufacturers and multinational corporations. Like their Western peers, young Chinese now crave VCRs, computer games, and stereo sys- tems, "not to mention brand names from Adidas to Tun' faded denim." The genera- tion gap is especially wide when it comes to clothing, Hooper adds. In TV and magazine ads, glamorous young women "drape themselves over mo- torbikes, sip expensive canned drinks, and tout the latest beauty products." Youth magazines such as Shanghai's Youth Gen- eration and Guangzhou's Golden Genera- tion now dwell on young romance. Pre- marital sex is still officially frowned upon, Hooper says, but cohabitation has become widespread among the privileged gaoganzidi (the children of high Commu- nist Party officials.) Most Chinese high- school students now attend sex education classes. Young performers, fashion designers, restaurateurs, and others, Hooper says, make up an "economic and social elite" among the new generation. Most young people live far away from the "glamorous world of hotel bars and health clubs." But television has made many rural youths aware of the seductions of urban life, and millions of them have been pouring into China's big cities - only to find their em- ployment prospects limited. Even high- school graduates face a tight job market, Hooper notes. Officials for years have spo- ken of daiye qingnian ("youth awaiting job assignment"), but they now acknowledge that China has a serious unemployment problem. China's aging leaders tolerate the new youth culture in the hope that it will serve as an escape valve for the underlying "rest- lessness and edginess" which they fear "might boil over into demands for change or simple strife." However, before many more years have passed, Hooper believes, the rising economic, social, and political aspirations of China's young people are go- ing to present a powerful challenge to that nation's rulers.

As late as summer 1990 it appeared that the need to rely on U.S. military power was fast disappearing. In the emerging world order, economic strength would be what counted most. The 1 2-nation European Community (EC) was already moving to- ward a much improved common market by the end of 1992. A newly unified Europe, with Germany as its economic dynamo, would soon, along with that other economic powerhouse, Japan, be joining the United States at the summit of international affairs. That was the dream, but, as Giuseppe Sacco in Commentary (Sept. 1991) and other analysts say, it did not last long. The awakening began in August 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The Gulf crisis, writes John Newhouse in the New Yorker (Sept. 2, 1991), "obliged the United States to do what only it could do, and reminded the European na- tions of their dependence on that special role." The crisis also displayed, as Sacco writes, a European Community unable "to shape even the slightest role for itself." Nor did the individual European nations, "preoc- cupied . . . with the balance-of-power situa- tion within the European theater itself," do what the Community could not. Germany, in particular, not wanting to complicate its relations with the Soviet Union, then consid- ering ratification of German reunification, aligned itself with the U.S.-led coalition only at the last minute. Even Britain, in appealing to its European partners to join in support- ing the United States, "had its eye on the fu- ture architecture of European security, to which it wished to keep the Americans moored as strongly as possible." The European Community resolved to do better in the next crisis - which came last spring, when Yugoslavia started sliding to- ward civil war. As the crisis unfolded, how- ever, European disunity became painfully apparent. Dissent by one nation or another always blocked Community action. Ger- many threatened to recognize Slovenia or Croatia, notes Suddeutsche Zeitung foreign editor Josef Joffe, writing in the New York drawn in the face of loud political opposi- tion at home.

But, they add, the United States should think twice before pushing it into a military role. Leaving aside Asia's anxiety about a revival of Japanese military power, there is the fact that the "trauma of defeat" lingers in the Japanese memory. Japanese public opinion is strongly against taking on such a burden, notes Ino- guchi, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo.

The Cold War's end, he says, "has . . . loosened the political bonds forged in the West," and left Western Europe look- ing like "a bunch of teenagers suddenly forced to fend for themselves." Yet European unification is not all illu- sion. The Community has been rapidly mov- ing toward removal of customs and other barriers as part of the effort to create a sin- gle market after 1992. Agreement reached in October between the Community and the seven-member European Free Trade Associ- ation means that Western Europe's 380 mil- lion people will be joined together in a pow- erful trading bloc. There has also been progress toward monetary union. But reach- ing a consensus on a political union that does not have a defense component that would undermine NATO and send Ameri- cans packing is proving no easy task. Trying to "deepen" the European Com- munity is hard enough, Newhouse says, but doing so while also "widening" it to take in aspiring new members from Central and Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, may be impossible. Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Turkey, Cyprus, and Malta are already knocking on the Com- munity's door. Some members, such as France, want only to deepen the Commu- nity; others, such as Britain, would rather enlarge it. The Germans profess to be de- voted to both operations. Their position re- flects their need "to prove themselves 'good Europeans' and so have a political license from their partners to concentrate ... on ab- sorbing 17 million new citizens [and] help- ing most of Eastern Europe move toward market economies and . . . democracy." German reunification, Sacco says, "has al- tered the balance within the very heart of the EC, bringing back to the surface certain unsavory qualities of nationalism and politi- cal rivalry." That makes a united Europe just as urgent a goal now as before the Cold War. Newhouse sees "cause for optimism." The "pivotal relationship" is between France and Germany, and each harbors doubts about the other's willingness to build a united Europe. The success of the Decem- ber 1991 EC summit meeting comes not a moment too soon. The EC, Newhouse says, is "Europe's last best hope of containing its furies." involved in world affairs, but in ways in keeping with its pacifist constitution. Ja- pan, in other words, "should continue to [focus] on commercial activities and en- deavor to make financial, technological, and scientific contributions to keep the world safe from hunger and war." Ito, a professor of international politics at Aoyama-Gakuin University who advo- cated sending Japan's Self-Defense Forces abroad during the Gulf War, decries "the emotion of 'one-country pacifism' in which the Japanese want to be the only ones who avoid all the risks." This deep- seated outlook, he says, "is rooted in our experience of the utter horror of World War II, including the atomic bomb." But, he argues, "now that the situation is one of 'having to do something for the sake of others,' Japan's postwar pacifism must confront its own logical bankruptcy and is losing its moral foundation Japan has become too important a nation to be the world's conscientious objector." Inoguchi insists that the Japanese are not being selfish. From their reading of history, they have derived a "deep skepti- cism about the utility of military power, es- pecially as projected onto foreign terrain for a prolonged period of time." Many Jap- anese suspect that "more enduring re- gional factors will diminish the long-term impact" of the Gulf War victory. More- over, Inoguchi adds, the Japanese are con- strained by others' reading of history. The prospect of Japanese military involvement in the Gulf War aroused the suspicions of the Chinese and other Asians who had suf- fered from past Japanese aggression. Hamilton and Clad urge the United States to tread cautiously. Were Japan to become a military force again, "the bal- ance of power would change dramatically, instantly destabilizing the [region] and transforming . . . Japanese domestic poli- tics." Japan's leaders do not want this; nor do its neighbors. "Neither should the United States." WQ WINTER 1992 153</page></plain_text>
