Du Bois s (1935/1998) Black Reconstruction in America , 1860-1880 is commonly regarded as the foundational text of revisionist African American histo- riography But Black Reconstruction did more than cor- rect the historical record, it also interrogated the very limits of historiography - what it can communicate, and what and who its "appropriate" subjects should be. Drawing on Susan Gillmans concept of race melo- drama as the dominant framework for late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century racial thinking, this article posits Black Reconstruction as a race melodrama par excellence, with special emphasis on the text s strate- gic invocations of music in emotionally and spiritually charged moments. To this end, it traces Du Bois s use of song, scenes of singing, librettos, and lyrics as both an affective and de-familiarizing device through which he is able to yoke the former slaves' messianic/religious experience of freedom and their understanding of democracy Keywords: W.

Black Reconstruction (1935) reconstitutes the Civil War and Reconstruction as labor history, and the black worker as the "founding stone" not only of the nineteenth-century U.S. economy but of the entire modern world - its key player (Du Bois 1935, 15). Modern labor history, Du Bois argues, is race his- tory, since the white working class consolidated itself in opposition to black slave labor. "The plight of the white working class throughout the world today," he contends, "is directly traceable to Negro slavery in America, on which modern commerce and industry was founded, and which persisted to threaten free labor until it was partially overthrown in 1863" (Du Bois 1935, 30) By 1863 millions of slaves had defected to Northern federal camps. In leaving the Southern plantations to join the Union Army, the fugitive slaves deprived the Confederacy of workers, servants, farmers, and spies and conferred these resources on the Union instead. One of Du Bois s key interventions is to insist that this mass confiscation of black labor in the 1860s should be understood as a "general strike." His Marxist-inflected claim for the centrality of the black worker to the Civil War flies in the face of traditional historiography, which attributed the war to "abstract doctrines concerning the nature of the Federal Union . . . leaving us apparently with no cause for the Civil War except the reiteration of statements which make great public men on one side narrow, hypocritical fanatics and liars, while the lead- ers on the other side were extraordinary and unexampled for their beauty, unself- ishness and fairness" (Du Bois 1935, 722). If the slave is absented from traditional accounts of the Civil War, he is activated with a vengeance in discussions of the "failure" of Reconstruction. In his final chapter, "The Propaganda of History," Du Bois surveys the existing body of scholarship on Reconstruction, drawing attention to its racist claims about white Southern martyrdom and black incompetence and perfidy. According to the historical "record," the failure of Reconstruction and the "tragic" demise of the South follow from blacks' misuse of power. Militating against these accusations, Du Bois declares that "if the Reconstruction of the Southern States, from slavery to free labor, and from aristocracy to industrial Democracy, had been conceived as a major national program of America, whose accomplishment at any price was well worth the effort, we should be living today in a different world" (Du Bois 1935, 708). Black Reconstruction at once laments the unfulfilled potential of a singular moment and conjures alternative presents and futures that it might have generated (and may possibly still generate). His project is then both a corrective for "unscientific" histories and a prophetic projection of the future within his grasp. In Blood Talk: American Race Melodrama and the Culture of the Occult (2003), Susan Gillman suggests that this interweaving of the religious topoi of prophecy with the scientific language of history is characteristic of turn-of-the-century dis- course on race. She maps the interarticulation of religion and science across Du Bois's artistic and sociological oeuvre (but interestingly enough not in Black Reconstruction ), calling this mode of history writing "occult history" and "racial melodrama" (Gillman 2003, 14). Drawing on Gillman s discussion of the</page><page sequence="3">66 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY melodramatic or "occult" histories of Du Bois's earlier period, I read Black Reconstruction as a race melodrama par excellence and discuss the possibilities that this mode offers for thinking about historiography. As a term, "melodrama" not only offers us an entry point into the morally inflected worldview that historiog- raphy tends to shirk but also provides us with the language to discuss the uses of the various musical interludes in Du Bois s text, such as librettos and descriptions of song and singing. To this end, I expand on Gillman s definition of melodrama and rehabilitate its original meaning of "a stage play, usually romantic and sensational in plot, and interspersed with songs, in which the action is accom- panied by orchestral music appropriate to the various situations" ( Oxford English Dictionary 2010). In doing so, I foreground the texts strategic invocation of music, which, I argue, mimics classical melodramas use of melos as a marker of the emotionally charged and ineffable experiences of its actors to elicit an emo- tional response from the audience. Black Reconstruction as Racial Melodrama In Blood Talk , Susan Gillman (2003) posits "race melodrama" as a heuristic for thinking through discourse surrounding racial relations in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. She contends that when writing about race, late- nineteenth-century and early-twentieth-century writers found recourse in a frag- mented, repetitive, and excessive mode of narration typically associated with the genre of melodrama. The same Manichean logic of darkness and light, black and white, good and evil underpins a wide range of texts in this era - ranging from scientific writings on race to race-fiction to occult texts, all of which derive their logic from legal, scientific, and religious definitions of race. Gillman s reading draws on the work of Peter Brooks, who defines melodrama as a desire to "express all" and make the world legible through spectacle and exces- sive representation (Brooks 1995, xii).1 The central project of Gillman s Blood Talk is to bring race into Brookss ideological reading of the melodramatic mode.2 In her introduction she suggests that to think racially at the turn of the twentieth century was to think in terms of melodrama, so that even when espousing dia- metrically opposite positions writers such as Sutton Griggs and Thomas Dixon were often calling on the same tropes and structures to buttress their arguments. The writing of this era, she remarks, is characterized by a desire to explicate the racial hierarchies of the present by obsessively narrating the past and reading his- tory racially. She terms this "a history of excess" or "occult history" after its ritu- alistic retellings of past events, real or imagined.3 A morally charged temporality that "leave[s] provisional the outcome of history itself' is common to all race melodramas of the period and frames both Thomas Dixons conservative counter- histories of Reconstruction and Du Bois's Marxist revisionist Black Reconstruction (Gillman 2003, 202). Dixon's and Du Bois's emphasis on the moral value of their works proves that histories of race and race relations are coded as moral histories, whether conservative or liberal, humanist or racist.</page><page sequence="4">DEMOCRACY'S NEW SONG 67 Respecting melodramas conception of recursive time, Du Bois urges his readers not to dismiss the living specter of slavery as an institution of times past. To this end, he remarks that the objective for writing this history was "to establish the Truth, on which Right in the future may be built," implying that narratives that illumi- nate the past and render it legible to its present audiences also hold the potential to activate futures (Du Bois 1935/1998, 716). In hinging this putative "Right in the future" on the historian s writing/righting of the past, Du Bois unequivo- cally endows the historian with a moral obligation to both past and present gen- erations. The labor problem, he contends, is a moral problem that extends beyond the realm of the nation-state. As Du Bois s thesis on the racialization of labor accrues transnational dimensions, Reconstruction comes to the fore as both a catalyst and effect of a global network of economic relations. If we approach labor history as moral world history, the fate of the late-nineteenth-century black worker can be read as an instance of the oppression of the global proletariat: Here is the real modern labor problem. Here is the kernel of the problem of Religion and Democracy, of Humanity. Words and futile gestures avail nothing. Out of the exploi- tation of the dark proletariat comes the Surplus Value filched from human beasts which, in cultured lands, the Machine and harnessed Power veil and conceal. The emancipation of man is the emancipation of labor and the emancipation of labor is the freeing of that basic majority of workers who are yellow, brown and black. (Du Bois 1935/1998, 6) Du Bois s unexpected yoking of religion, democracy, and humanity in his definition of the modern labor problem suggests that his revisionist project extends beyond a critique of economic oppression. His coupling of religion and democracy is par- ticularly striking since we tend to regard these two modes of naming collectivities as antithetical, but here and elsewhere in the text they seem contiguous with one another. Black Reconstructions narrative of the possibilities and failures of U.S. democ- racy are shot through with intimations of a divine order. Toward the end of his chapter on the white worker, he evokes the bygone dream of democracy - "Supreme Adventure, in the last Great Batde of the West for . . . human freedom" - and supplants this narrative of human agency with that of divine intervention. The forward march of the white working classes, these "self-reliant pioneers, unafraid of man or devil" is brought to a sudden halt by a divine act: "Some unjust God leaned, laughing, over the ramparts of heaven and dropped a black man in the midst" (Du Bois 1935, 30). In a similar vein, Du Bois s final chapter discusses the missed opportunities of Reconstruction in terms of a Marxist critique of the failure of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" and through the religious language of transgression. The stillborn delivery of democracy is depicted as a blasphemous crime against a weeping God: God wept; but that mattered little to an unbelieving age; what mattered most was that the world wept and still is weeping and blind with tears and blood. ... The world wept because within the exploiting group of New World Masters, greed and jealousy became</page><page sequence="5">68 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY so fierce that they fought for trade and markets and materials and slaves all over the world until at last in 1914 the world flamed in war. The fantastic structure fell, leaving grotesque Profits and Poverty, Plenty and Starvation, Empire and Democracy. And the rebuilding, whether it comes now or a century later, will and must go back to the basic principles of Reconstruction in the United States during 1867-1876 - Land, Light and Leading for slaves black, brown, yellow and white, under a dictatorship of the proletariat. (Du Bois 1935, 635) This emblematizes the interplay of Du Bois s dual hermeneutics: Marxism and religious prophecy. In capitalizing the first letters of concepts that we associate with economics - "Profits," "Poverty," "Starvation," and "Empire" - and attributing to them anthropomorphic qualities such as grotesqueness, he, in effect, personifies them and situates them within the moral order of allegory. In Du Bois s "scientific" account of the past, religious prophecy is never far behind. If, as Gillman has suggested, race history is race melodrama, then the seem- ingly irreconcilable rhetorical pairings of affect and reason, political science and religion, despair and hope can, in fact, be reconciled.4 In other words, the inter- nal contradictions of the hybrid melodramatic mode allow for the marriage of disparate beliefs and methodologies - such as Du Bois s Marxist and messianic reading of history. In describing the history of African Americans in America, Du Bois declares, The most magnificent drama in the last thousand years of human history is the transpor- tation of ten million human beings out of the dark beauty of their mother continent into the new-found Eldorado of the West. They descended into Hell; and in the third cen- tury they arose from the dead, in the finest effort to achieve democracy for the working millions which this world had seen. It was a tragedy that beggared the Greek; it was an upheaval of humanity like the Reformation and the French Revolution. Yet we are blind and led by the blind. We discern in it no part of our labor movement; no part of our industrial triumph; no part of our religious experience. (Du Bois 1935, 727) Du Bois speaks of "religious experiences" and "labor movements" in the same breath, reiterating his earlier rhetorical binding of religion, democracy, and humanity as if this were par for the course in historical writing. Furthermore, he conceives of African American history as an evangelical narrative of sacrifice and redemption, echoing the gospel language of resurrection. Whereas Jesus rose from his tomb on the third day, African Americans "arose from the dead" in the "third century" to achieve not a kingdom of heaven but democracy on earth. Rather than opposing hell to heaven and tyranny to democracy, Du Bois col- lapses the secular/religious divide and paints a world whose two contending forces are hell and democracy. True to his melodramatic form, he takes the con- cepts of good and evil as givens and refers to them the way another historian might speak of justice or tyranny. For example, in surveying the historiography of Reconstruction, Du Bois admits to being astonished by "the recurrence of the Idea that evil must be forgotten, distorted, skimmed over" (Du Bois 1935/1998, 722). Neither the status of evil nor the role of divine intervention is fodder for tradi- tional historiography, yet they are integral to Du Bois s revisionist history of Reconstruction. According to Du Bois, it is all but impossible to tell this story as</page><page sequence="6">DEMOCRACY'S NEW SONG 69 anything but a moral history. In "The Propaganda of History," he critiques the "mechanistic" impulse in historians who read "with a comfortable feeling that nothing right or wrong is involved" (Du Bois 1935/1998, 715). He discerns this impulse in Charles and Mary Beards Rise of American Civilization (1927), which maps the history of American industrialization onto the history of Reconstruction without paying heed to the lived human experiences of its actors. Moreover, he argues that such dry interpretations of human history leave no room for the real plot of the story, for the clear mistake and guilt of rebuilding a new slavery of the working class in the midst of a fateful experiment in democracy; for the triumph of sheer moral courage and sacrifice in the abolition crusade; and for the hurt and struggle of degraded black millions in their fight for freedom and their attempt to enter democracy. (Du Bois 1935/1998, 715) Du Bois s revisionist project does more than rearrange facts and evidence about the "actual" events and motivations of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Rather, at the heart of Black Reconstruction is the desire to articulate an affective history, what Raymond Williams has called "structures of feeling" of a given historical moment. It is this commitment to recovering lived experience that obliges Du Bois to ask "what Emancipation might have meant and felt like for the slaves" (Du Bois 1935/1998, 722). Du Bois reinvests historiography with affect to represent Reconstruction as a moral history. By bringing affect and morality to the fore in his retelling of the history of the Civil War and Reconstruction, he offers an alternative mode of writ- ing history to that of the Beards, whose "mechanistic" narrative excludes matters of emplotment, blame, guilt, morality, and the affective experiences of people. "Can all this be omitted or half suppressed," he asks, "in a treatise that calls itself scientific" (Du Bois 1935/1998, 715)? Du Bois's claim that truth, morality, and affect are the "true" subjects of science may seem paradoxical, but upon closer consideration we realize that his coupling of science and truth, and democracy and religion, is symp- tomatic of the alternative ontology that Black Reconstruction offers to its reader. Therefore, Black Reconstructions revisionist impulse cannot be reduced to a cor- rection of racist accounts of Reconstruction s putative failures, but should rather be understood as an effort to radically reconfigure what history is and what it does. Du Bois s alternative approach to historiography is evidenced by his inclusion of a chapter titled "Coming of the Lord," whose very title suggests to the reader that it will deal with an unorthodox subject. He begins the chapter with a penetrat- ing analysis of the organization of free labor after the end of the Civil War and offers a detailed account of the chain of events that took place between the Emancipation Proclamation and the various pieces of legislation passed during the early years of Reconstruction. He then traces the missteps of the legislators to explain how different their contemporary moment could have been had Southern paranoia and tacit Northern prejudice not thwarted the democratiza- tion of the South. After arguing that "it was the fugitive slave who made the slaveholders face the alternative of surrendering to the North, or to the Negroes, Du Bois turns his attention to the discrepancy between the initial potential of Reconstruction and its</page><page sequence="7">70 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY eventual bleak reality by imagining how the newly freed slaves would have under- stood this moment (Du Bois 1935/1998, 121). Soon after, he asks, "So in blood and servile war, freedom came to America. What did it mean to men?" (Du Bois 1935/1998, 121). By placing the subjective experiences of the freed at the center of his discourse, he implores his readers to acknowledge the human stakes of the war and demonstrates that there is more to the story of the 1860s than the eco- nomic downfall of slaveholders. In an attempt to answer his own question, Du Bois must also come to terms with the fact that the four million emancipated black slaves understood the events of the Civil War as a fulfillment of proph- ecy - as the coming of the Lord (which, incidentally, is how he titles this chap- ter). He explains that in the minds of most slaves, "even the more intelligent ones," the coming of freedom was understood as coeval with the coming of the Lord (Du Bois 1935/1998, 121). "This was the fulfillment of prophecy and legend," he writes. "It was the golden dawn, after chains of a thousand years" (Du Bois 1935/1998, 121). Du Bois is aware that such prophetic interpretations of history would sound quaint and foolish to his more "serious," secular readers, and so he ventriloquizes their potential objections in advance: "Foolish talk, all of this, you say, of course" (Du Bois 1935/1998, 123). He then attributes this skepticism to the readers ahistorical approach to past structures of feeling and affect: and that is because no American now believes in his religion. Its facts are mere symbolism; its revelation vague generalities; its ethics a matter of carefully balanced gain. But to most of the four million black folk emancipated by civil war, God was real. They knew Him. They had met Him personally in many a wild orgy of religious frenzy, or in the black stillness of the night. His plan for them was clear; they were to suffer and be degraded, and then afterwards by Divine edict, raised to manhood and power; and so on January 1, 1863, He made them free. (Du Bois 1935/1998, 124) How do we account for an interpretation of the Civil War that posits divine rather than human agency as its driving force? This is a spectacularly perplexing passage, given that this lyrical chapter comes immediately after the section on the general strike, in which he ascribes the slaves' critical agency. Du Bois claims in one chapter that the four million slaves were agents (and particularly important ones at that) and in another attributes their actions to a higher power, finding them to be "divinely" inspired or blessed. He is alternately swept away by the religious orgy of his subjects, proclaiming that "All that was Beauty, all that was Love, all that was Truth, stood on the top of these mad mornings and sang with the stars" and unsettled by their "foolish, bizarre, and tawdry" spectacle (Du Bois 1935/1998, 124). The religious ecstasy of the newly freed men and women whom Du Bois describes is consistently mediated through song. Affect, religiosity, and song are mapped on to each other throughout the text, wherein song lyrics, scenes of sing- ing, and librettos accompany emotionally charged and spiritual moments in the historical narrative. Curiously enough, these musical interludes have failed to attract much critical attention even though critics have used musical tropes to describe the text. Charles H. Wesley, an early reviewer, calls Black Reconstruction a "lyrical history," and 70 years later, Gillman reads it in terms of racial melodrama. Both</page><page sequence="8">DEMOCRACY'S NEW SONG 71 Wesley and Gillman describe the work in terms of hybrid musico-narrative genres, such as the lyric and melodrama, but never make note of the actual musical refer- ences in the text. This oversight is especially curious given that two of the most important and inflammatory chapters - "The General Strike" and "The Coming of the Lord" - not only close with lyrics to well-known musical pieces (the lyrics to the famous abolitionist song "John Brown s Body" and Schillers "Ode to Joy," best known as the libretto for Beethovens Ninth Symphony) but also explicitly stage scenes of singing. Neither Gillman nor Wesley comment on the fact that the two chapters most concerned with the slaves' subjective experiences of slavery and freedom - or in Du Bois s words with "what freedom meant to the freed" - are also the most musically saturated sections of the book. Black Reconstructions New Song The idea that music, and African American spirituals in particular, is a reposi- tory of black history is not unfamiliar to anyone acquainted with Du Bois s opus. Thirty years earlier, in The Souls of Black Folk , he had referred to slave songs as "sorrow songs," claiming that they are "the music of an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment; they tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer world, of misty wanderings and hidden ways" (Du Bois 1999, 189). According to Du Bois, these plaintive songs were the slave s only outlet and the only vehicle through which he or she could address the world, sometimes openly but most often in coded language. He goes on to argue that, despite the various changes in the lyrics and words that these songs went through after being passed on from one generation to the next, the music retained the original woeful tone and therefore conserved the messages of slave ancestors. As such, they provided Du Bois with an "alternative archive" of feeling and experiences. Du Bois s sociological training, coupled with his literary tastes, made him espe- cially attuned to the potential cultural work that these "sorrow songs" could do. Indeed, these songs could address questions that traditional histories could never adequately pose or answer - such as "What did it mean to be a slave in antebellum America?" - the prefigurai question to Du Bois's famous "What does it mean to be a problem?" which he posed in the opening of his collection. Thus, he took the sorrow songs as the point of departure for each chapter of this pastiche-like, multi- generic text and thus musically framed his collection. Reflecting on this framing strategy in the final pages of the volume, he states that "before each thought that I have written in this book I have set a phrase, a haunting echo of these weird old songs in which the soul of the black slave spoke to men" (Du Bois 1999, 156). The harmonious juxtaposition of song and narrative that Du Bois stages in the pages of Souls of Black Folk demonstrates on the level of form his thesis that American practices of storytelling and singing are coeval as well as coextensive in that they find their origins in the expressive culture of former slaves. Thus he contends that the gifts of story and song were among the most important African American contributions to U.S. culture, highlighting the crucial role that music</page><page sequence="9">72 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY has played in preserving histories of affect. The sorrow song, he contends, "has traveled down to [African Americans] and we sing it to our children, knowing as little as our fathers what its words may mean, but knowing well the meaning of its music" (Du Bois 1999, 157). 5 While Black Reconstruction does not foreground music epigraphically in the way that Souls of Black Folk does, its employment of melos is no less significant or systematic. In this text, music serves as a marker of pathos, and as such, it both announces emotionally charged passages and creates this emotional excess in the narrative. Characteristically, these are descriptions of freedom, wherein music is used to indirectly describe or express the ineffable experience of emancipation. If Du Bois repeatedly invokes the slave song at crucial moments, it is perhaps because he considers it the only expressive form that can approximate the for- mer slave s nascent understanding of freedom. The status of the slave song as a privileged alternative archive of experiences of bondage and freedom becomes evident in the last three pages of "The Coming of the Lord," wherein Du Bois tries to describe the subjective experience of what it would have felt like to be emancipated in January 1863. The first physical break in the layout of the text occurs after the sentence "Free, them, with a desire for land and a frenzy for schools, the Negro lurches into the new day" (Du Bois 1935, 123). The next line is left blank, followed by a horizontal line marking a transition to a new section (though not a new chapter). This break functions much like a caesura, which in poetry and music represents an audible pause between two sections that are logically connected. The section that follows the caesura is a lyrical descrip- tion of the former slave s new desires and frenzy signaled in the above-mentioned line: "Suppose on some gray day, as you plod down Wall Street, you should see God sitting on the Treasury steps, in His Glory, with the thunders curved about him?" (Du Bois 1935, 123). Here he describes the ecstasy of the newly emanci- pated in terms of a religious experience - "a wild orgy of religious frenzy" - and bitterly laments in their mistaking war and revolution "for the mystery of the human soul" (Du Bois 1935, 124). As the passage becomes more emotionally charged, the pace of the lines quickens, reaching a crescendo in the final explosive line: "A great human sob shrieked in the wind, and tossed its tears upon the sea - free, free, free" (Du Bois 1935, 124). After this line there is another break in the text - again a caesura - and the next section continues where the previous one left off. And we learn that the great human sob became a joyful song of freedom: A great song arose, the loveliest thing born this side the seas. It was a new song. It did not come from Africa, though the dark throb and beat of that Ancient of Days was in it and through it. It did not come from white America - never from so pale and hard and thin a thing, however deep these vulgar and surrounding tones had driven. Not the Indies nor the hot South, the cold East or heavy West made that music. It was a new song and its deep and plaintive beauty, its great cadences and wild appeal wailed, throbbed and thundered on the worlds ears with a message seldom voiced by man. It swelled and blossomed like incense, improvised and born anew out of an age long past, and weaving into its texture the old and new melodies in word and in thought. (Du Bois 1935, 125)</page><page sequence="10">DEMOCRACY'S NEW SONG 73 These lines force us to come to terms with the limits of representation - the experience of freedom remains ineffable, articulated only in a "great human sob" and intimated through the cadences of the lines describing the tragic beauty of the new song of freedom. In the third section - or third movement - which is marked off from the preceding text by the same type of caesura as the previous two parts, Du Bois reifies the quotidian practices of freedom after the Emancipation Procla- mation as well as its redemptive effect on whites. If former slaves were "hencefor- ward and forever free," then, by extension, the whites who had hitherto facilitated their bondage were henceforward and forever purged. "Suddenly, there was Reason in all this mad orgy," he exclaims. Drawing his chapter to a climactic close he declares, "Suddenly, the world knew why this blundering horror of civil war had to be. God had come to America, and the land, fire-drunk, howled, the hymn of joy" (Du Bois 1935/1998, 126). The chapter ends with an excerpt from Schillers poem "Hymn of Joy" in the original German: Freude, schöner Götterfunken Joy, beautiful spark of divinity Tochter aus Elysium, Daughter of Elysium , Wir betreten feuertrunken, We enter, drunk with fire, Himmlische, dein Heiligtum! Into your sanctuary, heavenly (daughter)! Deine Zauber binden wieder Your magic reunites Was die Mode streng geteilt; What custom strictly divided; Alle Menschen werden Brüder, All men will become brothers, Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt. Where your gentle wing rests. Seid umschlungen, Millionen! Be embraced, you millions ! After devoting pages to black folk songs, it might seem surprising that Du Bois gives Schiller, a German Romantic, the final word. Yet this classical musical ref- erence is not as misplaced as it might seem at first glance. Schillers poem may not speak to the specific circumstances of American slavery, but it does, however, address the idea of human freedom, the central theme of "The Coming of the Lord." The German lyrics reiterate the sentiments expressed in Du Bois s own text - "schöner Götterfunken"/"the beautiful spark of divinity" recalls his description of Gods descent to America, and "Alle Menschen werden Brüder"/" All men will become brothers" corresponds to Du Bois s "At last there could really be a free commonwealth of freemen" (p. 126). This excerpt of Schiller's text speaks to Du Bois s argument that the history of African Americans in the United States should be read as an integral part of world labor history and world revolution. In a sense he is reversing the universalist narrative of world history, which has relegated his subjects to the margins and, at best, treated the plight of the black worker as "local" history. Du Bois frames this excerpt in such a way that Schillers immediately recognizable incantations of human liberty seem to prefigure the emancipatory narrative of black men and women in the United States, and, conversely, the songs and cries of freedom in 1863 realize the potential of Schillers words and give them meaning.</page><page sequence="11">74 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Du Bois does not include the English translation in his text but leaves Schiller s text in the original German. One possible explanation for this has to do with the symbolic status of the "Ode to Joy." First, though it precedes Beethoven s Ninth Symphony, it is almost exclusively linked with this musical piece. Indeed, it has become all but impossible to think of the Ode without immediately recalling the famous notes of Beethoven s masterpiece. We are safe to assume that Du Bois is referring to the musical version of the "Ode to Joy" and not simply Schillers poem since he clearly states that the land "howled" (meaning sang) the hymn of joy In other words, we are thus invited to imagine Schiller s lyrics being sung rather than recited. The Ninth Symphony would have been particularly interesting to Du Bois because it has been associated with the ideals of liberal humanism ever since it was first performed. Not only do its lyrics explicitly center on the question of freedom, but it was also considered to be the most "free" piece of music of its time. In fact, Beethoven s Ninth Symphony was the first classical composition to use a human chorus and to treat the human voice as a symphonic instrument. So central is the voice to this piece that it upstages the content of the lyrics. As music historian Esteban Buch points out, the pieces privileging the human voice over the lyric "added to the difficulty, even for a German-speaking public, of understanding the words when sung, [and] was to lead many exegetes to overlook the meaning of Schillers words in favor of a pure metaphysics of the human voice" (Buch 2003, 44). Buch suggests that the lyrics themselves have historically been less important to audiences than the music itself. It was the melody, and the human voice in par- ticular, that communicated ideas of freedom and fraternalism, therefore the alienness of the German words on his page is unimportant. The hymn of joy, just like the sorrow songs described in The Souls of Black Folk , would be institutively under- stood before its linguistic message was successfully communicated. The libretto to the Ninth Symphony thus metonymizes the sound of freedom, much like the intimations of the former slaves' "new song of freedom" indirectly mark a state of mind and feeling that exceeds representation. Du Bois undertakes a similar task to this in the "General Strike" chapter and in an earlier moment of "The Coming of the Lord," with excerpts from the famous abolitionist song "John Browns Body." Just as he ended "The Coming of the Lord" with an invocation of the sound and song of freedom, he ends the "General Strike" chapter with an incantation of the sound of revolution. In the final paragraph, he conjures the specter of the black soldier marching to the promise of freedom: "The guns at Sumter, the marching armies, the fugitive slaves, the fugi- tives as contrabands,' spies, servants and laborers; the Negro as soldier, as citizen, as voter - these steps came from 1861 to 1868 with regular beat that was almost rhythmic" (Du Bois 1935, 83). Reading this sentence out loud, one notices that the very beat and rhythm mimic the marching of the soldier. The first three sections divided by commas - "The guns at Sumpter," "the marching armies," "the fugitive slaves" - contain five syllables each and contribute to the effect of an even walking tempo. What follows is a short commentary on black military citizenship, and then the paragraph ends with the image of soldiers marching to the tune of "John Brown s Body," which Du Bois calls "the noblest war-song of the ages":</page><page sequence="12">DEMOCRACY'S NEW SONG 75 Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored. He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword, His Truth is marching on! (Julia Ward Howe in Du Bois 1935, 83) Interestingly enough, the song that he cites as "J°lm Browns Body" is in fact an excerpt from Julia Ward Howe s "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," which has a verse and chorus of equal metrical length to "John Browns Body," although the latter has more syllables - and by extension more lyrics - than the former. We know that this is not an accidental miscitation, for he cites the actual lyrics to "John Browns Body" in the following chapter, in a scene highly reminiscent of this one where the Federal troops are celebrating a victory: "The following spring, April 3rd, the Federal troops entered Richmond. Weitzel was leading, with a black regiment in his command - a long blue line with gun-barrels gleaming, and bands playing: 'John Browns body lies a-moldering in the grave but his soul goes marching on'" (Du Bois 1935, 111). Du Bois cites two different versions of this song for the same purposes as when he cited the German lyrics of "Ode to Joy" without providing the English translation. In effect, the words of the songs (both the "Ode" and the "J°lm Brown s Body") - what Lindon Barrett has called "the signing voice" - are less important than the sound of the singing voice with its phonic attributes and messages. As a dynamic, expressive form, the song of the free black men and women is able to communicate past structures of feeling and make them legible - or in this case audible - to its listeners in Du Bois s contemporary moment. Testifying to the mnemonic power of song, he exclaims, "Yet it lived and grew; always it grew and swelled and lived, and it sits today at the right hand of God, as America s one real gift to beauty; as slavery's one redemption, distilled from the dross of dung" (Du Bois 1935, 125). Conclusion What is the political purchase of music or melos in Black Reconstruction ? Melodrama is an intensely pedagogical genre that provides its reader or viewer with very explicit clues as to what they should be feeling and thinking at a par- ticular moment. Much of this instruction is orchestrated through emotive use of music, hence the term rae/odrama. Orchestral music or movie scores that punctu- ate the storyline interpolate the audience into the storys melodrama and manipu- late their emotions to such a degree that they cry, laugh, and rage together with the protagonists, empathizing fully with their moods and state of mind. The reading experience of Black Reconstruction is not dissimilar to the viewing experience of a melodrama on stage or on the silver screen. Du Bois s combination of emotive language and invocations of song induce an affective if not a visceral response from the reader. From the opening line onward, Du Bois insists that the Civil War was not just a historical event but "the most dramatic episode in</page><page sequence="13">76 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY American history" (Du Bois, 1935/1998, 1). Furthermore, in infusing his moral history of this episode with musical elements, he veers from the dramatic to the melodramatic. For example, his lyrical rendition of Gods weeping at the plight of the slaves is accompanied by a plaintive song of frustrated freedom. Similarly, the explosive description of a slave s orgasmic sobbing at the moment of realiza- tion that he is free is followed by a joyous song of freedom. But why does this musical hailing matter? For one, Du Bois s strategic shifts from prose to musical interlude de-familiarize the reading process by introducing a new reading practice. Thus the musical sections perform, rather than represent, the disjunctures between Du Bois s moment of writing and the experiences of his subjects. But music does more than just mediate representation; it effectively interpolates the reader and makes certain demands of her. It instructs the reader which moments to read in terms of pathos and where to recognize the tragedy of Reconstruction. In other words, music becomes a regulatory and pedagogical means for attuning the reader to a different understanding of history. One of the upshots of Du Bois s "tuning" of his reader is that it requires her to view herself as not just an inheritor but an active participant in the legacy of Reconstruction. In doing so, he also reveals to her the ways in which the unrealized potential of this seemingly bygone era haunts her contemporary moment. Interpolation then becomes the first step in Du Bois s transmission of faith in the democracy to come. Notes 1. According to Brooks, in classical melodrama "nothing is spared because nothing is left unsaid; the characters stand on stage and utter the unspeakable, give voice to their deepest feelings, dramatize through their heightened and polarized words and gestures the whole lesson of their relationship" (Brooks 1995, xii). 2. In her introduction Gillman writes, "One condition of making legible through the melodramatic mode the open secrets of race is keeping the unspeakable things unspoken, that is, saying the name of race, itself always elaborately masked, and then, structurally, canceling out the saying" (Gillman 2003, 18). 3. Noting race melodramas investment in the racial past, Gillman argues that "from their location in the present, the race melodramas face toward the past rather than the future to construct constitutive relations between present and past, with the future a signal pressure, if not presence, charged both with messianic and with apocalyptic possibilities" (Gillman 2003, 202). 4. As Gillman points out, "When racialized, the melodramatic mode becomes relational rather than divided and divisive, imagining a range of crosscutting, contradictory alliances and conflicts across groups variously defined, not only by race, gender, and nation, but also by competing political, economic, and socio- cultural identities and differences" (Gillman 2003, 14). 5. The domain of music in Souls of Black Folk does not signify a departure from his scientific or socio- logical work, such as The Philadelphia Negro , but it is symptomatic of a more fluid and interdisciplinary early school of sociology of which Georg Simmel, Max Weber, and he were part. Kemple (2009) insists that the traditional divisions between scientific and "lyric" or nonscientific are not fully applicable in the classical period of sociology between 1890 and 1920. Thus he states, "All three thinkers observe how musical expres- sion follows or departs from the logic of social communication among skilled specialists and ordinary lay- people while also projecting alternative modes of human sociality" (p. 189). Noting that the members of this triumvirate were not only contemporaries reading similar sources and employing similar methodologies but were also in conversation with each other and each other s work, Kemple contends that their individual writ- ings on the relationship between musical expression and modernity are indicative of a disciplinary invest- ment in these issues rather than of discrete or aberrant endeavors.</page><page sequence="14">DEMOCRACY'S NEW SONG 77 References Beard, Charles A., and Mary R.
