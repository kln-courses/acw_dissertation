<plain_text><page sequence="1">Contribution à la Lexicographie française selon d'anciens Textes d'Origine juive by Raphael Levy. Syracuse University Press, i960. 658 pp. $9. It is some thirty years now since Professor Levy published his Recherches lexicographiques sur d'anciens Textes d'Origine juive in which he presented over eight hundred cases where Old French glosses found in Jewish texts gave new meanings to words in Old French or helped to correct meanings wrongly attributed to them. The present work is a much amplified, far more detailed continuation of these studies. Professor Levy lists his glosses in the same alphabetical order as in the earlier work, giving the Old French term, a translation where necessary in modern French, and then a philological discussion of each gloss, often at considerable length. Whereas the Recherches lexico- graphiques were essentially a rather bald succession of Hebrew lemma and Old French glosses, the new work goes on from there to fill in the picture philologically, to compare the Judeo-French gloss with the use of the word in normal Old French as shown in the dictionaries of Godefroy, Tobler-Lommatzsch, von Wartburg, etc., to discuss thorny questions of etymology and disputed interpretations. The first thing about this book which strikes the reader is the wide range of Professor Levy's knowledge and the depth of his scholarship. He moves repeatedly from Hebrew to Old French, on into modern French and the patois as found in the numerous dialect dictionaries and linguistic atlases, and on occasion will chase his quarry not only outside the boundaries of France and into Romania, but even beyond the con- fines of the Roman world into the lands of the Germanic-speaking</page><page sequence="2">68 Medium íEvum xxxi. i peoples. Nor is this an insubstantial froth of scholarship, concealing a hasty or superficial coverage of the real centre of interest, the Old French material. Professor Levy has the great merit of accepting nothing on second-hand evidence. Using Godefroy, he will compare the first part of the dictionary with the Complément , will check not only the readings given in texts but also the variant readings, and even, on occasion, the manuscript itself. The results are often enlightening. On p. 66, for example, we are shown how a printer's error in the date of alignement given in the Dictionnaire Général is repeated by Bloch, who is copied by Dauzat, the correct date being being given by the FEW in which the source was checked; rebouiller (p. 515) turns out to be a printer's error for rebouillir which has crept into the second edition of Cotgrave, and from there into Godefroy, from where it has been accepted by Spitzer and von Wartburg. Again, the discussion of akitement (pp. 56-8) not only shows that Bloch and Dauzat failed to consult the Complément , but, by a close study of the text of the Bible, disposes of the subjective interpretation given by Lerch of the development of quitter. The gloss binioner 'faire des beignets' (pp. 140-3) takes us back, surprisingly enough, to the different manuscripts of Joinville's Histoire de Saint Louis. It is only natural that with such a careful, painstaking approach to lexicography many valuable additions and corrections can be made to our current dictionaries of Old French. In the first place there is the obvious question of dating: it is not uncommon to find Professor Levy's Judeo-French material pushing back by as much as two or even three centuries the earliest attested use of a word. To mention only two at random, there is the case of abourjonner, hitherto known only as a hapax in Cotgrave (161 1) and now found in the thirteenth century (pp. 28-9); or the case of poupée , whose first attested date can now be moved from the thirteenth to the eleventh century (p. 180). Perhaps less obviously but of greater importance are the corrections which Levy's precise scholarship enables him to make, principally to the dictionary of Godefroy, but also, inevitably, to those works which have followed Godefroy without always checking his material and his interpretations. Only a few of these corrections can be mentioned here: there are the derivatives of chausser ably sorted out and labelled (pp. 185-9); the identifying of words mis-read in the manuscript - duçainnê p. 261, ducer p. 262, cens for ceus p. 511, encoremens, a simple mistake for encore meus pp. 285-6; an example of homoeoteleuton on Godefroy' s part which results in étuyer being given the meaning 's'obscurcir' instead of 'retirer' (p. 335) and so on. In a work of this length there must of necessity be points with which the reader will be in disagreement. Leaving aside the plethora of starred</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 69 forms used to explain the derivation of foie (p. 3 5 5), where etymologists may well find bones of contention, the ordinary reader may perhaps be excused if he raises an eyebrow at this kind of statement: 'Quant à fouir, il vaudrait mieux le faire dériver de *fodire pour le vieux français, où il existe depuis 1115, et de *fodiscere pour la langue moderne à cause de l'assimilation de sa conjugaison à celle des verbes avec la même désinence' (p. 371). The break in continuity of development implied in this unfortunate remark is, of course, purely imaginary, and Professor Levy is usually too well aware of the living quality of his material to indulge in this kind of dessicated etymology. Indeed, on another occasion he goes so far in the opposite direction as to lay himself open to a charge of anthropomorphism: 'La vie de ces mots peut servir d'allégorie: la viole, après avoir engendré la vielle, l'a fait dégénérer comme par suite de jalousie' (p. 596). It would be easy to dwell at length upon the failure to deal fully with plugeau (p. 5 10), which does not always mean 'vent du sud', or on the absence from the section on travail (pp. 579-81) of adequate reference to Livingston's Skein-winding R eels with its detailed examination of all the various etymologies advanced for travail and its derivatives, but this would be grossly out of proportion to the great mass of excellent, detailed work in this book. Misprints are commendably few for so large a work - Clef d'amor for Clef ď Amors p. 35; Sneyder de Vogel for Sneyder s de Vogel p. 40; franzpsiche for französischem p. 60; two miss-spellings of La Curne de Sainte-Palaye pp. 98 and 549; Färbe for Farbe p. 114; Le Livre de Métiers for Le Livre des Métiers p. 170; Warburg for Wartburg p. 191; ches for chez P- 202 j W'eise for Wiese p. 241; bedrângnis for bedrängnis p. 254; a somewhat odd tide FLinleidungschrift öffentlichen Prüfung Volkschule israeli- tischen Gemeinde on p. 316; leaire for l'aire p. 391 ; the editor of Walter de Bibbesworth was Annie Owen, therefore elle, not il on p. 399. Since this book will be used essentially as a dictionary, it would be most helpful if the word-lists at the end gave a complete list of all words which find their way into Professor Levy's net. For instance, he demolishes boudelier, which is in Godefroy, showing that it is simply a mis-reading for bourbelier (p. 45 9), yet the index gives the latter, but not the former. Likewise aposté, apparently wrongly translated by Godefroy, is dealt with on p. 493 but is not mentioned in the index. Another expres- sion which could usefully find a place in the index is Chrestiens cle la saincture , discussed at some length pp. 500-2. The above points are mentioned not to detract from the merit of Professor Levy's book, but simply to ensure that in any future edition the maximum benefit might be derived from an important piece of scholarship which is bound to become a standard work of reference for all engaged upon the study of Old French.
