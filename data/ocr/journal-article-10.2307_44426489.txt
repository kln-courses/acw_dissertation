Johnson The NeXT Announcement On October 12, 1988 many of the nation's schools celebrated Columbus Day. In San Francisco's Davies Sym- phony Hall, Steve Jobs, a modern-day Columbus, co-founder of Apple Com- puter, driving force behind the Apple Macintosh, announced the long-awaited NeXT Computer System. Academic Computing reported, ". . . journalists sat with pencils, pads and hatchets ready for the NeXT announcement. By noon when the violinist and the computer struck their last notes, hatch- ets fell to the floor as all in attendance rose to give the violinist, the computer, NeXT and Steve Jobs a standing ova- tion."1 The following week the major U.S. news magazines reported NeXT's announcement. Newsweek , in the midst of the Presidential campaign, devoted its October 24, 1988 cover to Jobs and NeXT, proclaiming, "Mr. CHI PS-Steve Jobs Put the 'Wow' Back in Comput- ers."2 In the following weeks dozens of computer publications described NeXT as the "Machine for the 90's."3 James W. Johnson is Vice Provost for In- formation Technology at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. Previously, Mr. Johnson headed CONDUIT, the higher-education software clearinghouse at the University of Iowa. The NeXT announcement comes eleven years after the introduction of the Apple II- the mainstream comput- er in America's schools. Educational technologists should examine NeXT for several reasons. First, NeXT designed its computer system for edu- cation, advised by leaders in educa- tional computing. Second, the NeXT Computer System contains key features of tomorrow's computers, features that make today's computers appear listless, clumsy, and uninteresting. Third, it represents a new wave of computers that will have a far greater impact than the wave of personal com- puters beginning over a decade ago. The transformation brought by this new wave may take ten years- but its effect will be as profound as it will be unpredictable. It will change our vision of the computer's role in teaching, learning and thinking. What are the NeXT Computer Sys- tem's key features? Why do they promise significant improvement in educational computing? How does the initial release feel? The answer about key features has been widely reported in the press. In a nutshell, the key fea- tures are power, graphics, sound, in- formation storage and retrieval, and ease of use. This article concludes by discussing the importance to education of these features. The response to the query about how the machine feels follows. The report on feel results from working with an early-release NeXT Computer. Turning It On In late January, our university delivery service deposited four boxes from NeXT at my door: one contained the computer cube (12 inches on a side) and keyboard; a second, the 17- inch megapixel display; a third, the mouse, cables and optical disk; and a fourth, the laser printer. Packaging and system design exemplify Jobs' atten- tion to detail. All connectors are clear- ly marked. A single cable links the cube to the monitor for power supply, video, keyboard, mouse, sound, and auxiliary input signals. The 200-watt power supply automatically adjusts to the world's differing power sources. The computer components are com- pact and well designed, indeed beauti- ful, if one likes Darth Vader black matte. The boxes contain one small booklet of documentation; the rest is on the optical disk. After fifteen min- utes of hooking-up cables, installing the laser printer cartridge and double checking connections, it is time to power-up. A key on the keyboard switches the power on (there are no switches on the system save a voltage switch on the laser printer). My first reaction after powering-up is WOW! The display is crisp and clear. The 17-inch monochrome monitor dis- plays 1120 by 832 pixels with four gray levels, 94 dots per inch, and a 68 cycle per second refresh rate. (This is more than twice as good as an average TV monitor). The computer asks the operator to insert the optical disk. The optical disk comes encased in a five-by- six-inch clear plastic container; it holds 256 million characters of information, over 300 floppy disks' worth; it is the world's first production erasable, read / write optical disk. Once the operating system is loaded, icons for application and a file manager called "browser" appears on the screen. The icons use gray scale to create a 3-D effect. As delivered, the system displays icons for the digital library, the laser printer, Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary and Thesaurus , the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations , WriteNow word proces- sor, Electronic-Mail, Clock, Jot- an editor, UNIX, and disk-builder. To fol- low are Mathematica, the premier mathematics symbolic processor, and SYBASE, a top-rated SQL relational data base management system. (Later browser will help us discover dozens of interesting applications on the disk not represented by icons.) Moving the mouse pointer to the digital library and clicking causes digi- EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/J une 1989 53</page><page sequence="2">- ^jj/ Ed Tech Product Reviews - tal librarian to load and display its workspace. The digital librarian pro- vides keyword searches of documents in the library. These now include the NeXT manual, the UNIX manual, Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus f the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations and the Compiete Works of Shake- speare. Clicking on Oxford Quotations, entering the word "power" and click- ing on search, shows and displays 144 occurrences, starting with Lord Acton's "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely," in a letter to Bishop Mandeli Creighton, 3 April 1887. Clicking on the Print icon produces 37 typographically perfect pages of the quotes containing "Pow- er" on the 400 dots per inch laser printer. (Of course, a single quote could have been printed as well.) While the printing is taking place, browsing through the disk reveals spec- tacular animated displays of molecules in motion. The 3-D display can be reduced or magnified, labelled, and the forces between the atoms can be changed. A statistics demonstration uses all the computer's manipulative, graphic, and computational power of the computer to make data come alive. A sound-maker plays harpsichord music and recordings of important speeches such as Martin Luther King Jr. 's "I Have A Dream" speech, while displaying King's visage on the screen. Richard Crandall, a Physics profes- sor at Reed College, created the mole- cules and statistics laboratory using the Interface Builder, part of the NeXT development environment. He is coauthoring a book on scientific use of the NeXT to be published by Addison- Wesley.4 A key NeXT advance, in ad- dition to ease of use, is its develop- ment environment using object orient- ed programming to rapidly create high quality software. IBM has licensed this product called NeXTStep for its UNIX workstations. A friend who develops software for teaching foreign languages says this is the most profound feature of the NeXT computer. After weeks with the NeXT, the initial Wow! has not faded. Familiarity does not reveal limitations; it reveals capabilities. Of course, in an early ver- sion there are problems. It lacks key software, it crashes unexpectedly, and it is slow in places. But these problems do not negate the overall impact. A New-Generation Computer The NeXT Computer System is in a class of computers unimaginatively called workstations. Over the past dozen years workstations have been the Indianapolis racing cars of comput- ing: fast, expensive, experimental, ex- citing, and suitable for a limited set of users. In recent years they have emerged as models for future personal comput- ers; they now present the fastest grow- ing computer market as industry dis- covers their usefulness. People often confuse workstations with personal computers. They should not. Starting at about the same time as personal computers in the late 1970's, workstations have different origins, purposes, and designs. Personal computers, beginning with the Apple II and continuing through the IBM PC family, brought comput- ing from the business firm to the home and from the isolated computer cen- ters to the office. They provided low- cost desktop computing for word pro- cessing, spreadsheets, data storage, and communications. They were a quan- tum improvement over so-called main- frame computers because they gave users the ability to customize and con- trol their systems; they provided a tex- tual orientation rather than a numeri- cal orientation; they were low cost; and they stimulated thousands of developers to create software ranging from word-processors to drill and prac- tice exercises. Their open architecture allowed connection of unique hard- ware for doing tasks such as control- ling videodisc players, or connecting to laboratory devices such as sensors on pulleys, or monitoring home appli- cants. But for all their advances personal computers contain serious limitations. Initially they used crude TVs to dis- play ASCII characters. Interaction via keyboard entry and text display mir- rored interaction with mainframes and minicomputers. Indeed, the Apple II acts much like the HP2000 mini-com- puter, giving entry to the BASIC pro- gramming language and being driven by terse text commands. The IBM PC with MS/DOS is simi- lar to the Apple with entry into BAS- IC and commands looking like IBM 360/DOS commands dating back to the 60's, with character displays from the early 70's. On both machines, communications is an add-on capabil- ity. In short, personal computers are textual ly rather than graphically ori- ented; commands are text based; the mode of interaction is through a key- board; users carry out one task at a time, and communications services are not built-in. Graphics boards, add-on mice and window displays do not alter the Apple II or MS/DOS computers as text, command-driven machines. Workstations also began in the late seventies with the Xerox Alto and Star and continued with the Apollo Do- main and Sun computer systems. Today Hewlett-Packard (9000 series), Digital Equipment (VAXStation), IBM (RT), and Apple (Macintosh II) also offer impressive workstations. These computers are based on thirty years of research on human interaction with computers beginning at Bell Labora- tories and were first designed with little regard to cost. They are visually orientated with graphic displays. Text, graphics, and images are presented on the same screen with the same display format. Interaction is through menus, icons, joysticks, touchballs, and mice. They allow users to carry out several tasks at one time on a single screen. They connect to other computers at very high speeds, providing rapid file transfer. Because none of these fea- tures come cheaply, early worksta- tions cost $50,000 to $100,000. They were first adopted in fields with high payoff such as computer-aided design and complex publishing requiring 2-D and 3-D displays, fast computation and typographically correct presenta- tions. Introduced in 1985, the Apple Mac- intosh dramatically demonstrated that a workstation-like environment with graphic displays and easy-to-use inter- actions were useful for more than a handful of computer hackers. While 54 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/J une 1989</page><page sequence="3">(fļ Ed Tech Product Reviews not a true workstation, the Macintosh borrowed heavily from designs such as the Xerox Star and set a standard for ease of use with windows, icons, pull- down menus, and a mouse. Early Mac- intoshes fell short of being worksta- tions because of their small screens, modest computation power, and single- task operating system and low-speed communications. A Macintosh prob- lem, shared by workstations, was that before HyperCard it was very difficult to develop software for the Macintosh. It took about three years to become the system of choice for innovative software developers. Because of ease of use and more recently, superior software, few users moving from a per- sonal computer to a Macintosh have ever returned to a personal computer. Building on Macintosh and work- stations, the NeXT Computer System combines the power and functionality of $20,000 workstations with software tailored for education, at a price of high-end personal computers with ease of use of a Macintosh. It makes three significant extensions beyond available workstations. First, it emphasizes sound as well as graphics. The machine records sound from microphones and synthesizes CD- Rom quality music. The Center for Performing Arts and Technology at the University of Michigan has an- nounced the Creative Station, NeXT software for performing artists offer- ing an interactive sound and graphics tool capable of generating multi-media art at a professional level. NeXT will be the system of choice for sound engineers and electronic music com- posers, but it also offers a sound (voice) dimension to more prosaic tasks such as sending messages or responding to queries. Second, it uses an erasable read/ write optical disk capable of storing vast amounts of information, images, sounds and text. The capacity is great enough to stimulate new thoughts about what can be stored and accessed on a computer. After previewing the NeXT Computer System, an Emory University Professor of English sent in his wish list, asking for the Oxford Dictionary of the English Language rather than the Webster's New Colleg- iate Dictionary , the Oxford Dictionary of the Mind, in addition to the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, the 11th edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica and NeXT-like interaction with univer- sity data bases such as the library cata- log system. Indeed, NeXT eliminates storage capacity as a barrier to innova- tion. environment intended to speed soft- ware development. The lead program- mer for Wolfram Associates, the devel- oper of Mathematica, has said that the typical adaption of Mathematica for a computer workstation such as the Macintosh II or Sun took 24 to 36 months. The adaption to NeXT took less than two months. The environ- ment sets a new standard for all appli- cation development based on twenty years' experience in software engineer- ing. Together the sound, storage, and development environment make NeXT Computers more than the sum of their parts. Impact on Education Whether Steve Jobs and NeXT suc- ceed or fail, there is little doubt that workstation-style computing will rev- olutionize the way we look at comput- ers in education. Forget that initially NeXT will sell only to higher educa- tion; this is simply a brilliant strategy for introducing innovative technology. In Steve Jobs' words, "Higher educa- tion users are a superset of the rest of the world. They are pushing the envel- ope at almost every step. So when you make a computer that meets higher ed- ucation's requirements, you end up making a machine to meet a lot of other people's requirements, too. There's no other market that's going to collaborate with you like that. There's no other market that's going to push you as hard."5 The real target is all of education, indeed all of intel- lectual activity, as it should be. Because workstations will trans- form how we go about intellectual tasks, they must be assimilated by ed- ucators. Tomorrow's workstations are not computers as now used in schools. They free users from the drudgery of the keyboard, the narrowness of text-, displays, and the need to remember ar- cane command sequences. By provid- ing images, visual spaces, high-quality sound, and anthropomorphic manipu- lation, workstations deliver intuitive interactions, a central element in human creativity. Enormous storage capacity and rapid digital retrieval of EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/June 1989 55</page><page sequence="4">= - ( ļ Ed Tech Product Reviews ļ ) text, images, and sounds will help re- define what it means to be an educated person in the 21st century. Such em- powering tools cannot be left to the elite few, thus further increasing the gap between "haves and have nots." Workstations also may have an im- pact on education more directly related to teaching and learning. Paralleling work on computer software, hard- ware, and human factors has been re- searched by a group of cognitive psy- chologists involving intelligence and learning. Their efforts at building learn- ing environments and intelligent tutors show great promise. Two major bar- riers to their work have been lack of easy-to-use development environment and the costs of computers providing stimulating learning environments. The NeXT wave of computers begins to overcome these barriers. But if history holds, the most pro- found effect of this technology is un- predictable. Society's experience with transforming technologies such as the printing press, steam engine, automo- bile, and even air-conditioner, reveals that the most significant consequences were unintended and unexpected. Printing presses did more than accur- ately transcribe Greek text for the few who could read. They stimulated liter- acy, reformation and, indeed, created Western culture as we know it. Steam engines did more than remove water from mines; they increased transporta- tion speeds from miles per day to miles per hour and began the global society. Automobiles did more than replace horses; they transformed the countryside, facilitated suburbia and altered courting habits. Air condition- ing did more than cool theaters; it led a population shift, resulting in the growth of the Sunbelt in the U.S.A. Indeed, we may look back thrity years from now and fancifully see Steve Jobs as a modern-day Columbus, who charted a course in the right direction, thus changing the way the Western world looked at itself. Colum- bus stimulated a new group of explor- ers and scientists; his effort could not be ignored. Similarly, the new wave of computer work stations cannot be ig- nored. In a 1981 Educational Technology article, "The New Information Tech- nology: A Force of History," I said of educators and technology, "If the new technology does nothing more than cause a serious discussion of the goals of education, it will have served a worthwhile purpose."6 I was wrong. The technology is so compelling, so empowering, so basic, that we must utilize it to extend our humanness. If educators reject it or see it as more of the same over the next decade, it will likely be at the peril of the educational enterprise. □ Notes 1. Read Me-Hardware.
