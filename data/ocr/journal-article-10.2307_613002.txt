<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAJAZ AL-QUR'AN: PERIPHRASTIC EXEGESIS By JOHN WANSBROUGH As a normative discipline Qur'anic exegesis shares both principles and terminology with the other Islamic sciences, and as such is not likely to have been articulated before the third/ninth century. Prominent in the fully elaborated system, as for example exhibited in the work of al-Zamakhshari (d. 538/1143), are the complementary principles of qiyds and taqdir. While the former is commonly understood to represent the hermeneutical instrument called analogy, a typological description of qiyds will distinguish between applications of the principle which depend upon a textual similarity, and those which are derived from a rational or causal relation. Of the first type it may be said that there are as many kinds of analogy as there are means of establishing external (grammatical and lexical) affinity between different scriptural contexts. Underlying the second type of analogy is a unifying principle (ratio) independent of textual similarities, both explicit and implicit.' In theory, if not always in practice, one may differentiate the two types of qiyds by reference to the incidence in each of what I have called the complementary principle of taqdir. This term, of which the most common rendering ' supplementation' (Ergan- zung), alluding to only one aspect of the procedure in question, is not quite satisfactory, signifies reconstruction or restoration (Wiederherstellung : resti- tutio in integrum), namely, of a scriptural context or passage. Now, while the elaboration of grammatical qiyds by the so-called 'Basran school' was characterized by an almost unlimited application of that principle,2 two reservations must be made. First, it may be shown that restoration of the Qur'anic text was not invariably called taqdir, and second, that if the appearance of qiyds as the basis of Arabic grammar is a comparatively late phenomenon, adoption by exegetes of the term taqdir is also posterior to their application of that principle, under another name. The development thus envisaged makes appropriate a study of terminology similar to the two earlier attempted for the rhetorical figures called madhhab kaldm~ and laff wa-nashr.3 In those studies it seemed not unjustified to postulate an historical development, that is, at least a chronological sequence in the employment of the terms under discussion. 1 See I. Goldziher, Die Zdhiriten, Leipzig, 1884, passim, but esp. 11, 41, 48, 56, 91-3, 184. In ch. iv of my forthcoming book, Qur'anic studies, a description of exegetical, as opposed to hermeneutical, qiyds is essayed. In the following pages discussion will be limited to the devices employed by exegetes to establish textual similarities as a basis for application of qiyCs, and more especially to their methods of' textual restoration'. 2 See G. Weil, Die grammatischen Schulen von Kufa und Basra, Leiden, 1913, esp. 48-68, but also 26: 'Das Taqdir ist die Notwehr des Grammatikers im Kampfe fiir das Qijds gegen die Ueberlieferung'. I find this formulation not entirely felicitous but note that it is qualified by the author's remark, 27 : ' Es (Taqdir) ist die Kehrseite der Qijilsmedaille '. I should prefer to regard qiyds and taqdir as originally and essentially separate principles, later incorporated as complementary components of normative exegesis. 3 See J. Wansbrough, 'Arabic rhetoric and Qur'anic exegesis', BSOAS, xxxI, 3, 1968, 469-85, and the reference there, p. 469, n. 1. VOL. XXXIII. PART 2. 17</page><page sequence="2">248 JOHN WANSBROUGH And in both the evidence appeared to suggest exegetical appropriation and fixation of terminology originally vague and most probably applied to shawahid from profane literature. Here, it may be provisionally proposed that 'textual restoration', conventionally represented by the expression taqdir, was also (and earlier) called majaz, and further, that the latter term evolved from the vague designation of an exegetical practice to the closely reasoned description of several rhetorical phenomena found in scripture as well as in profane literature. In the introductory chapter to his Majdz al-Qur'dn, Abaf 'Ubaida Ma'mar b. al-Muthanna (d. 209/824) describes 39 kinds of majdz.4 Since, with but a few exceptions (to be mentioned below) this description appears to correspond to the author's employment of the term in the course of his exegesis, examination of the 39 instances of Qur'anic majdz, with their respective loci probantes, will not be out of place.

Disorder, repetition, and lack of clarity notwithstanding, Abil 'Ubaida's exposition of majaz would appear to support at least one observation, namely, that he did not understand that term in the sense of the antithetical relation majdz-haq7qa. Indeed, none of the categories described nor the examples adduced to illustrate them suggests a consciousness of figurative language. Even nos. 14 (personification) and 20 (emphatic repetition), conventionally conceived of as schemata in Arabic rhetoric, reflecb a preoccupation with textual clarity rather than with literary embellishment.5 But in almost every case the canonical text is separated from the author's variant by the locution wa-majazuhu.6 That majdz is here also not the equivalent of tafsir (explanation) is clear from the author's use of the latter term even in the introductory chapter.7 That this early example of exegesis should be grammatical rather than rhetorical or homiletic is hardly surprising. But apart from the possibly idiosyncratic use of the term majdz, Ab-i 'Ubaida's work is characterized less by a preoccupation with normative grammar than by a concern to alleviate the strictures imposed upon the language by Qur'anic diction. For example, in LXVI, 4 (no. 5) the reading zahir is necessitated by rhyme, as is ha'jizin in LXIX, 47 (no. 8), and t.'i'in in xLI, 11 (no. 10), and thus they do not illustrate valid exceptions to the rules of concord.8 Instances of ellipsis (nos. 1, 2, 3, 19, and possibly 31, 32, 33) do not, with one exception, represent rhetorical use of that phenomenon, but merely the vagaries and inconsistencies of an uncertain style. In xII, 82 (no. 2) the expression wa-sal al-qaryata ... wa 'l-'ira may be regarded as tropical, and indeed, constructions of this type were later subsumed by grammarians under the rubric ellipsis.9 But for the principal theorist of 6 NiBir Iillwi, in his A study of Abil 'Ubaida Ma'mar ibn al-Muthannd as a philologist and transmitter of literary material (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of London, 1966), 306-59, renders majaz 'trope' and thus assumes for Abdi 'Ubaida the antithesis majdz-4aqiqa. 6 In the course of his commentary Abii 'Ubaida uses also ay and ma'ndhu for this purpose. See below, p. 258. 7 e.g., I, 1, 1. 13, and curiously 1. 20: majaz tafsir, clearly synonymous with majaz (as in 11. 3-7, 11-12). Tafsfr itself was in all likelihood not yet an exegetical terminus technicus, see BSOAS, xxxI, 3, 1968, 470, 473 ff. 8 cf. T. Nbldeke, Neue Beitrdge zur semitischen Sprachwissenschaft, Strassburg, 1910, 9-10, 13. 9 Ibn al-Anbdri, al-Insaf fi masd'il al-ikhtildf, Cairo, 1961, 61, with the further specification ba_.hf al-muddf wa-iqam al-mud.f ilaihi maqgmahu, resulting here in synecdoche.</page><page sequence="9">MAJAZ AL-QUR'AN: PERIPHRASTIC EXEGESIS 255 rhetorical majaz, 'Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani (d. 471/1078), this example was acceptable as majaz only because it exhibited an alteration of i'rab (from genitive to accusative), on the grounds that mere ellipsis (hadhf) could not be regarded as figurative language.10 On the other hand, the examples of varia inflexio adduced by Abfi 'Ubaida (nos. 38, 39, and possibly 27) will not be seen to qualify as majdz in this sense, since the choice of i'rib (nominative and accusative) is regarded by the author as optional. The passages in no. 38 do, however, exhibit a common phenomenon of Arabic syntax: isolation of the natural subject.11 Though Abi! 'Ubaida does not touch upon the grammatical implications of that construction here, in his commentary (I, 267-8) to Qur'an Ix, 92, jl . y he observes that strict concord is necessary only in a nominal clause, here described as the normal construction (fa-hddh. 'l-musta'mal). But the concord appropriate to a verbal clause may, he adds, be employed in this construction, if it is regarded as exhibiting chiasmus (ka'annahu muqaddam wa-mu'akhkhar). It may however be observed that, characteristic of Abti 'Ubaida's majdz, his examples of taqdim wa-ta'khir (no. 22) reflect not the figurative application of hyperbaton, but rather, a clumsy hysteron proteron. Indeed, Qur'an xxiv, 40, La1 ? , is the classical locus probans for a much discussed ambiguity inherent in the negative use of kdda.12 Logically, Abfl 'Ubaida explains anacolutha by reference to ellipsis (no. 3), for the common Qur'anic construction hatt5 idhd_, commonly but not always to be interpreted as hatta, idha followed by two dependent clauses. When one of these is missing, as here (Qur'an xxxIx, 73), the result must be regarded as an infelicitous blend of sentence types, not as a rhetorical figure.13 Again, with regard to the incongruent apposition of ikhwatun and akhawaikum in Qur'an XLIx, 10 (no. 4), the author recognizes the influence exerted by t.'ifatdni in the preceding verse. On the other hand, it is his own logic and not the Qur'anic text, which appears to have been contaminated by a preceding dual (al-unt4ha- yaini), in the author's commentary to Qur'an Iv, 11 (no. 7) since there is no need here to postulate discrepant concord. Apparent discrepancy, as in Qur'an xxvI, 4 (no. 23), may be interpreted as constructio ad sensum, though here rhyme will be seen as the operative factor. The anomalies of mujmal constructions, involving a single predicate and multiple antecedent (nos. 9, 11, 12, 13),14 as well as the instance of synesis (no. 37), might also be explained as 10 Al-Jurjini, Asrdr al-baldghha, ed.

Save for Qur'an LIV, 49 (no. 6), khalaqtuhu for khalaqndhu, and II, 2 (no. 15), haddh 'l-qur'dn for dhalika 'l-kitab, there is only xIx, 19, anc rasiil rabbiki, for inclusion of which there may have been doctrinal reasons. Its appearance in no. 6 I am inclined to regard as a lapsus calami,20 but the variant risdla provided in no. 26 may be interpreted as introducing the following statement li'ahaba laki ghuldman, which is in turn understood as the content of the message, thus obviating the problem of oratio recta (hikayat qawl allih).21 In addition to the explicit typology, the term majiz appears elsewhere in Abfi 'Ubaida's commentary, e.g. for Qur'an v, 2 and xxvIII, 27, where it is the equivalent of ma'nd and the explanation merely lexical (I, 147 ; II, 102, resp.), and for Lxxv, 1, where it is employed to describe 1dm ii 'l-qasam (II, 277). These do not unfortunately diminish the lack of clarity surrounding the terminological function of majaz, which, however, would appear to consist largely in the insertion of explanatory elements into elliptical phraseology. If we consider, for example, the author's analysis of Qur'an LXXXIII, 3 (no. 31), kflit lahum aw wazanti lahum for kailjhum aw wazanithum ; of I, 5 (no. 32), ild 'l-sirdti or ii 'l-siriti for al-sirata ; and of xx, 69 (no. 36), inna sani'ahum for innamd sana'i ; the contrast between text and majdz exhibits the resolution of a synthetic construction, though admittedly the process evident in the first two examples is reversed in the third. A further instance of this kind of analysis is to be found in Abai 'Ubaida's commentary (II, 148) to Qur'an xxxIv, 24, J ! j l JJ j j1l 0C{, 'And We or you are rightly guided or 15 Al-Zamalcishari, Kashshif, ad LV, 22, observes: lammai 'taqay&amp; wa-sara ka 'I-shay' al-wdhkid. 16 N61ldeke, NBSS, 10-12. 17 ibid., p. 12, n. 4, where for 28, 16 read 28, 76. 18 See A.

In this sense it is proposed that majiz al-qur'Jn is periphrastic exegesis. Now, with regard to the type of construction exhibited in Qur'dn xII, 82 (no. 2) Ibn al-Anbari (d. 577/1183) specifies 'substitution of the muzdhf ilaihi for the mud.f' and proposes the restoration (taqd'r) ahla 'l-qaryati.24 Thus, what was for Abdi 'Ubaida majaz is for the later grammarian taqdir. Within the framework of Ibn al-Anbari's terminology taqdir is contrasted with lafz and zdahir and, as an exegetical device, must be subordinated to the notion of textual integrity implicit in both.25 An opportunity for its application is afforded by the hysteron proteron in Qur'an n, 124, "-j? A) I i) 'And when his Lord tried Abraham with words ', in which taqdir is required on dogmatic grounds.26 In profane literature taqdir may be employed to eliminate ambiguities resulting from darfirat al-sh'ir, as in the hemistich .J1J 4L (J) . j-t*l td I 57 'As the sparrow shivers (after being) drenched by rain '." But as taqdir had by that time become the basis of grammatical analogy, its application was limited, by a kind of circular logic, to phenomena susceptible of analogical restoration. It was thus not applicable to contexts characterized by hapax legomena.28 This restriction reflects, of course, the Basran interpretation of qiyais and, consequently, the predominance of taqd;r 'al&amp; 'l-lafz over taqdir 'ald 'l-ma'nd.29 That such a situation represents a later rather than an earlier stage in the evolution of Arabic grammatical theory emerges from the fact that the process inherent in taqdir is signalled in 22 Based on the equivalence aw : wa, cf.

A sampling of scriptural and other passages to which textual restoration is applied will illustrate the typological equivalence majaz : taqdir.

'And (the decree of) your Lord goes forth '." Similarly, material of dogmatic content in fiqh may be so treated, as in al-Qastallani's commentary to al-Bukhiri, Kitab al-Jum'a, SJL C. . 5(lyj) ,) L. J1 . 4 I y J. 'The Friday ablution is enjoined (urged) upon every adult male '.38 It will be clear that taqdir is employed in a variety of circumstances very few of which may be interpreted as exhibiting figurative language. Equally clear, it seems to me, is the functional similarity of taqdir and Abfi 'Ubaida's majaz. So applied majdz/taqdir include both restoration of elliptical phraseology and resolution of synthetic constructions. Reasons for adducing this exegetical device range from grammatical to doctrinal, and thus comprehend the scope of the normative sciences ('uliim di-niyya), which share a common methodology. Characteristic of the elaboration of Islam, this methodology is by no means exclusively Islamic, as can be shown in an examination of the exegetical techniques employed by Saadya Gaon (d. 942).39 There, in his interpreta- A4 AI-Zamakhshari and al-Baid.wi ad xxx, 87; see above, p. 254, n. 9, and I.

It may further be shown that the periphrastic devices employed by Saadya in his analysis of elliptical and synthetic Hebrew phraseology reflect conventions of Qur'anic style, and especially of the narrative formulae by means of which Biblical material was incorporated into Muslim scripture. For this purpose Saadya employs such minimal units (kleinste Redeformen) of Qur'anic rhetoric as bwn/n?; /rpr, / 9 n1/ n ,1 as well as particles like : / K b, etc.40 In view of the Gaon's academic back- ground and intellectual environment, a common methodology is hardly surprising, though Saadya's specific debt to the Mu'tazila (mutakallimiin) has frequently been overstated.41 It is the substance of scriptural revelation and the nature of historical polemic which provide the common framework, and the sword, not unnaturally, cut both ways. Rather than with the ascertainment of specific historical contact(s), comparative studies might to greater profit be concerned with the establishment of phenomenological parallel(s).42 Owing to the procedural uniformity of Saadya's exegesis a selection of Stichproben is more or less arbitrary. Because he regards Sefer Tehillim as a sequence of revelations to David, Saadya's commentary-translation furnishes a typical illustration both of his own method and of an attitude to scripture similar to, though not identical with,43 that of the Muslim exegetes towards the Qur'an.44 His treatment of ellipsis is characteristic: Ps. lxxxv, 14, jr' 31r ' rs ' Righteousness shall go before Him ', is rendered by Saadya 71p1 i " t' w p  i iT ''They seek justice going before Him', in which p-sr is interpreted as p- wT.45 Ps. lxxxix, 6, mm ,, ,lb tr  r I 'And the heavens shall praise Your wonders 0 Lord', becomes nt "jn3 xt ' ,Nx ntr 'As the inhabitants of heaven shall praise Your excellence '.4 The exegetical device operative in these examples is contained in the ninth of the hermeneutical modes (middot) ascribed to R.

For reasons of dogma prepositional constructions are frequently introduced, in order to eliminate or to alleviate anthropomorphic expres- sions.57 Ps. cix, 27, ; ,nt m inr'nx t I~r m i"t 'That they may know that this is Your hand, that You, Lord, have done it', is rendered xnnt-y =-1 ~' nlzm lnz?p In '7a nxmn l7 mt ir ,nn 'That they may know that these things (are wrought) by Your power, You, Lord, have done it '.58 In Ps. cviii, 12, lnnrl amn, ~xnt , 'Will You not, Lord, who has cast us off ', the subjunctive particle tb?b (designated ,a~ ,j) is inserted to mollify the finality of the statement x n?it 1n X- lam 1' 'Had You not, Lord, abandoned us '.9 On the other hand, restoration by means of particles can be purely grammatical, as in Ps. cvii, 20, where nin i.i is read Z11V_~ and translated maDnn3);Vn t 'from their destruction'; 60 Ps. cviii, 7, where for Irvr, Saadya substitutes yl,, 'by Your right hand'; 61 and Ps. cxix, 70, where qInin becomes "Innllnn 5 Galliner, Psalmen, p. xix, p. 41, n. 5; and cf. p. 38, n. 13, with reference to Ps. lxxxi, 17: 1"MCK08 interpreted as W1Y172tH. 54 Lauterbach, Psalmen, p. xv, p. 43, n. 10, and p. xviii, p. 49, n. 15, resp. 66 Lauterbach, Psalmen, p. xix, p. 53, n. 31. 56 Kitib al-luma', 312: cf.

' is converted into a statement (prohibition), ' Inn~ n inn x ihi xn n?'x  'God, do not abandon me nor deflect Your mercy from me', an interpretation which, besides eliminating the anthropomorphism in "] , is clearly a consequence of the kind of reasoning which would prompt Ab-f 'Ubaida to interpret Qur'an 11, 30, " y  l " ' (And the angels said) will You place there (on earth) one who will do evil there ?' not as a simple interrogation (istifham), which approaches blasphemy, but as a rhetorical question, equivalent to a negative assertion or statement of fact (taqrir).76 Ab-i 'Ubaida's last category (no. 39) of majaz is an instance of varia inflexio (wujah al-i'rdb) exhibited in Qur'dn xx, 63, $,-LJ 0 i% 1 -. In his com- mentary (II, 21-3) to this much disputed passage, he adduces the usual variants (inna hadhaini la, in hadhni la, in hadluhni illd, etc.), mentions their dialectal origins, and adds: 0iJ ki lL .AA  I 0LJ JA "O1 , 1 Ji1 c.iJ A jL 0-J0 I. The distinction between J~iJ and .5: , not taken up by later exegetes for this passage, is of interest for two reasons: first, because it reflects the principle underlying -17 and n; and second, because it alludes to the problems provoked by grammatical and exegetical difficulties in a text fixed by tradition. The relation of Saadya to the Masorah has been discussed by every scholar dealing with his exegesis, and it would appear from his treatment of textual problems that his Vorlage was in fact the Masoretic one. Within the latitude permitted by the traditional qir&amp;'dt, it would also seem more than likely that Abi 'Ubaida's Qur'anic text was established, though it would be rash to guess at how long this had been so.7 On the other hand, the attitude of the later grammarians to textual problems 4" Galliner, Psalmen, p. ix, p. 25, n. 4 ; Abfi 'Ubaida, no. 34.

From internal evidence it could be argued that the mechanism itself of majaz (as later of taqdir) can only have been devised to meet the problems posed by a more or less fixed text.</page><page sequence="19">MAJAZ AL-QUR'AN: PERIPHRASTIC EXEGESIS 265 was conditioned by their application of taqdir, which implied in theory at least that a restored text (muqaddar) took precedence over its transmitted version (malfiz.).78 An argument such as this, even if purely theoretical, represents the Basran rationalization of Arabic grammar, in which the canonical role of taqdir had progressed beyond the point illustrated by Abni 'Ubaida's application of majFaz. The equivalence majaz :periphrasis is proposed for the following reasons. Despite their later incorporation into the rhetorical traditions exemplified by badi' and ornatus, respectively, they exhibit basically and originally an immutatio verborum, introduced both as a stylistic and as an interpretative device. Motives for the one or the other are not always and easily distin- guishable, though it would seem permissible to argue that in exegetical problems stylistic variation counted for little. And yet it was only natural that sacra philologia should entail an awareness of syntactical irregularities which, out of respect for scripture, would be described as stylistic variation or even figurative usage. Saadya's employment of the term majaz is in this sense ambiguous. In his introductions to the Pentateuch and to Job he speaks of nxt~,ia ii,', x YxorKa nodx '1,i= and a ,'x T 'n ' xi',x, which would seem to refer to idiom and popular usage, and adds ;1xnN )en nmav zv'ri z x', x tn i' nr1114 n'n 7n 9x s xil xj ?*x 'That the ren- dering take into appropriate consideration idiom in accordance with what is current and not obscure amongst the people '." On the other hand, the presence in scripture of anthropomorphisms is attributed by Saadya in Kitab al-amandt wa 'l-i'tiqddat also to majaz: . I1 J  j ' for which the meaning 'trope' would not be unreasonable.80 And it will be recalled that certain of Abai 'Ubaida's categories of majiz (e.g. nos. 14, 20, 22) belong also to the corpus of rhetorical schemata, though the Qur'anic instances adduced by him exhibit but weak reflection of figurative usage. For both Abfi 'Ubaida and Saadya the principle contained in majdz is clarification rather than embellishment as, in classical periphrasis, the underlying factor may be necessitas as well as ornatus.sl It is indeed but a short step from exegetical to rhetorical majdz. We have seen (above, p. 255, n. 10) that al-Jurjani could accept Qur'an xII, 82, as majdz only on the grounds that it exhibited inflective alteration (taghyir al-hukm) 78 See the references to Ibn al-Anbfri adduced by Weil, Gramm.

For al-JurjanI majaz (tropical) stands in an antithetical relationship to haqiqa (veritable), the contrastive definition which became a convention of rhetorical terminology.82 That it was also he who was instrumental in the establishment of this contrast is clear from his remarkably detailed, and occasionally polemical, discussion of majaz.83 There he sets out the contrast in terms of a distinction between formal expression of a concept (lughawi) and intellectual apprehension of it ('aqli), the coincidence of which marks a veritable proposition when no inter- pretative step (ta'awwul) is required, and a tropical proposition where such is required.84 Further, the interpretative step presupposes a recognition of both the object/concept to which the proposition is tropically applied (ghair mustahaqq) and that to which it is veritably applied (mustahaqq), which means that every trope is basically a simile (tashbih), whether explicit (sarih) or implicit (ghair sar4h).85 Finally, there are two subjective conditions to be met: first, it must be quite clear to the hearer that the action tropically attributed cannot be veritably effective, as in the statement ,UI 60. - CJ. 'Love for you has brought me to you'; second, it must be known of the speaker that for him all causality is ultimately attributable to God, and that actions may be only secondarily related to other causes. Thus, Qur'an XLV, 24, }..\ t? X. ly: 'Nothing destroys us but time', the utterance of an unbeliever, must be regarded not as majaz but as haq7qa.86 Less dogmatic in fact than it may appear, this last observation is addressed to opponents of majdz in the Qur'an, who went to absurd lengths in explaining away blas- phemies arising out of a literal interpretation of figurative language. As such it is very similar to admonitions expressed by Maimonides on the same subject in his Daldlat al-h.'irfn (ii, xlvii, on figurative language in scripture, xlviii, on the expression of causality). For al-Jurjani majaz is essentially a stylistic phenomenon, but also exegetical to the extent that its efficacy requires partici- pation of both speaker and hearer, writer and reader, and thus exhibits a logical development from the periphrastic exegesis of Abfi 'Ubaida.87 82 Al-Tahinawi (d. 1158/1745), Kitdb kashshsf is.tildh4t al-funfin, Calcutta, 1862, 208-23. 83 A8srr al-balghha, paras. 21-3, and supplementary 24-6 ; a less sophisticated refutation of arguments against Qur'anic majdz is found in Ibn Qutaiba (d. 276/889), Kitab ta'wil mushkil al-Qur'&amp;n, Cairo, 1954, 99. 84 Asrdr al-balagha, paras. 23.3, 5. 85 Asrdr al-balg.ha, paras. 23.1, 8. 8s Asrar al-bal.gha, para. 23.10. 87 Asrdr al-balagha, paras. 23.11-16, 26.8, 9; cf.
