THE Thirteenth Annual Session was called to order at 3.30 P.M. in the Assembly Room of the Board of Education (Public Library Building, Euclid Avenue), by the President, Professor Lewis R. Packard of Yale College, New Haven, Conn. The Secretary, Professor Charles R. Lanman of Harvard Uni- versity, Cambridge, Mass., presented the following report of the Executive Committee: a. The Committee had elected as members of the Association: Benjamin W. Wells, Ph.D., Fellow of the Johns Hopkins University, Balti- more, Md. George Bendelari, Instructor in Modern Languages, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. Edward S. Sheldon, Tutor in German, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. b. The Proceedings had been duly published. The Transactions were all in type and nearly ready for distribution. c. The Committee had directed the Secretary to distribute thirty complete sets of the Transactions among the principal learned societies of Europe and Asia, and to send copies of the eleventh and twelfth volumes of the Transactions to the principal libraries of the United States, gratis, with a circular, offering to complete the set for twelve dollars (half the regular price). The Secretary presented an invitation from the Cleveland Union Club, tendering to the members of the Association the freedom of the Club during their stay in the city. The Treasurer, Mr. Charles J. Buckingham of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., presented his report, showing the receipts and expenditures of the year (see p. 32). On motion, the Chair appointed Professor F. A. March and Pro- fessor T. D. Seymour a committee to audit the Treasurer's report. As committee on the hours of meeting, the Chair appointed Pro- fessor C. H. Toy and Professor Lawrence Rust.</page><page sequence="4">Proceedings of the Professor John Williams White, of Harvard University, presented the following resolutions: Whereas, Many colleges in the United States have in recent years conferred the degree of Doctor of Philosophy not by examination but honoris causa, be it Resolved,first, That this Association deprecates the removal of this degree from the class to which it belongs (namely, B.D., LL.B., M.D., and Ph.D., - degrees conferred after examination), and its transfer to the class of honorary degrees. Secondly, That a committee of three be appointed to present this resolution to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and to request them to co-operate with this Association in addressing a memorial to the Boards of Trustees of all colleges in the United States empowered to confer degrees, stating the objections to conferring the degree of Doctor of Philosophy honoris causa, and praying them to discontinue the practice if it exists in the colleges under their control. Professor William D. Whitney, of Yale College, moved that the resolutions be referred to the Executive Committee. The motion was carried. Communications were then presented as follows: I. On Homer and Strabo, by Dr. E. G. Sihler, of New York City. The period of Greek literature beginning with the death of Alexander is in- teresting because of its analogies with our own time. Then as now there was the general tendency to erudition and encyclopedic accumulation, and the oppor- tunity for scholars to apply historical, critical, and grammatical study to the great authors of the classic period. In the Augustan age this movement re- ceived a fresh impulse from the favorable political and social conditions attend- ant on general peace and easy communication. This was when Strabo flourished. His travels extended from Armenia to Etruria, and in the South to the boundaries of Abyssinia (Strabo, page II7, Casaubon). To his knowledge of mathematical and physical geography and political history he joined an accurate and compre- hensive acquaintance with literature, and so has been able to fill his work with literary and biographical notes to accompany his account of the birthplaces of men of letters. Of all authors, the one most persistently quoted by Strabo is Homer. Meineke's index shows seven hundred and twenty distinct references to Homer, while the much more reliable material of Herodotus is used but thirty times. Thus Homer is quoted as authority on Spain, on the peoples of the Danube (p. 295), on the historical geography of Elis (p. 337), etc. "The Homeric Epos, and especially the Odyssey," says Kiepert (Lehrbuch der alten Geographie, p. 3), "shows the first traces of the transition to the Greeks of the half-fabulous stories of Phenician mariners about the lands they had visited." How now does it happen that Strabo, with his abundant equipment of learning, refers so constantly to his revered but untrustworthy Homer ? 4</page><page sequence="5">American Philological Association. 5 This question Mr. Sihler attempted to answer by showing that among the numerous geographers who preceded Strabo, copious discussions of the Homeric geography had been usual. Strabo did not start them. Indeed, he himself tells us (p. 348, cf. p. 337) that he would not have given so much care to the examination of traditions if he had not received them and grown up with them from child- hood, and seen that they met with great acceptance among many of his prede- cessors and contemporaries. Strabo's personal knowledge often enabled him to state the present condition of things; but the reputation of Homer would not allow Strabo's statements to pass without some critical comparison, or reconcile- ment in case of difference. Eratosthenes (275-194 B.C.), the most important of Strabo's predecessors, denied to Homer all authority as a reliable source of information for history or geography. Strabo often finds occasion to enter into polemic with him; and, in view of the learning and high standing of Eratosthenes, it was an essential point with Strabo to vindicate the disputed authority of the great poet. Successors of Eratosthenes had concerned themselves much with Homeric geography. Apollo- dorus wrote a voluminous commentary on the " Catalogue of Ships" (Iliad ii.); Demetrius of Skepsis treated fully the topography of the Troad; Polybius, the historian, cited Homer, and argued the question whether the places of Odysseus's wanderings might be identified; Posidonius devoted much space to the treatment of Homeric problems; and Aristonicus, a contemporary of Strabo, wrote a work repl T7rs MevEAdou rXAv71s, which Strabo himself made use of. Thus Homeric discussion had gone on from Eratosthenes's time to Strabo's, and Homer's fame had in no wise abated. No wonder, then, that Strabo should give so much space to Homeric subjects. Herein he reflects the studies of his forerunners. This gives us an idea of the literary activity of the Alexandrian period. Polemic was no less common than with us; but it was carried on differently. It was the criticism of predecessors by those that came after them, instead of the rapid exchange of views between contemporaries. 2. The Testimony of the Talmud respecting the ancient Pronun- ciation of certain Latin Letters, by Professor James S. Blackwell, of the University of Missouri, Columbia, Mo. It is known from the Talmud that the Jews of the first centuries of our era gave great attention to orthoepy, - as appears, for example, in the ridicule of the Galilean provincialisms; and that constant contact with the Romans afforded them good opportunities of learning the best Latin pronunciation, which, there- fore, we may suppose to be fairly represented by the transliterations of the Talmud. We consider here only two letters, the Roman c and s. The first of these is regularly transliterated in the Talmud by p, rarely (and probably from carelessness of copyists) by 2 (which rather represents Greek x), and the second by D and not by iw. Now p is not our k, but a more guttural sound, and D is harder than our s; nor can we expect absolute accuracy in these representations. Yet the transliteration of the c by the p seems to place the sound of the former as far as possible from a sibilant. So far as the testimony of the Talmud goes, it favors the hard sound for Latin c. Nevertheless it must be added, in respect to the general question of our present Latin pronunciation, that the impossibility</page><page sequence="6">6 Proceedings of the of recovering the precise sounds and restoring tone and accent, and the consider- ation of economy of time, make it wiser to use the English sounds of the Latin letters. Professor Whitney criticised the conclusion of this paper. He advocated as near an approach to the ancient pronunciation as is possible. 3. The Home of the Primitive Semitic Race, by Professor Toy, of Harvard University. Indications of the original dwelling-place of the Semites have been sought from four sources, national traditions, the grammar of the parent-language, its vocabulary, and early Asiatic history; but none of these furnish satisfactory data. i. It is only among the Hebrews (and Assyrian-Babylonians) that traditions of national and racial origin are found, and the geographical statements in these are fluctuating and indecisive. The position of Eden and Ararat, if known, would not fix the Semitic home. The table of nations in Genesis x. gives the geographical distribution of the peoples speaking Semitic tongues, but not their original centre. The story of the dispersion locates the whole world at one time in Shinar or Babylonia, but does not state in what directions the various nations went from that point. It is impossible to gather anything definite from these data. 2. It has been assumed that the people whose grammar most nearly represents that of the parent-speech dwelt in the primitive home of the race, which has therefore been located in central Arabia. This assumption, however, is untenable. Retention of primitive linguistic forms is due not to the place of abode, but to freedom from influences that produce grammatical change, and such argument can lead to no results. 3. It is supposed that the physical features, climate, minerals, plants, animals, etc., of the cradle of the race may be deter- mined from the vocabulary of the parent-tongue. In seeking for the primitive vocabulary, it is especially necessary to guard against reasoning from the absence of words, since many original words may have fallen out of the various dialects. Supposing the common vocabulary determined, this may fix a place where the race once dwelt, though great caution is necessary in drawing inferences; it does not follow, for example, that all minerals whose names occur in the primitive tongue are products of the soil, - they may be imports; nor can we in all cases conclude that the present condition of localities is the same as that of very ancient times. Different investigations of the vocabulary have assigned the primitive Semites to Babylonia and to the southeastern coast of Arabia, without arriving at data sufficient to decide between these two localities; and it is possi- ble that other data may point to other localities. Further, if it is shown that a race once occupied a certain district, it is still possible that it may have come thither from some earlier home. 4. Controlling or guiding data are sought in supposed indications of the early Babylonian or Akkadian records. If the Sem- ites dwelt all together in Babylonia, and were there the pupils of their predeces- sors the Akkadians, they ought all to show traces of Akkadian influence. But this is true of only a part of them, the northern branch, and the Sabeans. It would thence appear that they had separated before entering Babylonia. This early history is, however, still very obscure.</page><page sequence="7">Ameerican Philological Association. Remarks upon the paper were made by Professors Whitney and Toy. The committee on the hours of meeting reported. It was arranged that the Association should hold sessions as follows: on Tuesday, at 8 P. M.; on Wednesday and Thursday, from 9 o'clock to i, and from 4 o'clock to 6. A recess was then taken until evening. CLEVELAND, OHIO, Tuesday, July 12, i88I. EVENING SESSION. The Association met at 8 P. M. The Annual Address was delivered by the President, Professor Lewis R. Packard, of Yale College. 4. The Morality and Religion of the Greeks. After a few introductory remarks, in which among other things reference was made to the loss the Association has sustained in the death of Professor S. S. Haldeman, the discussion of the Morality and Religion of the Greeks was taken up in the form of answers to the following questions: I. What was the origin of the moral ideas of the Greeks ? Not the Olympian theology in the earliest form of it known to us, nor any religious ceremonies, nor the speculations of philosophers; nor yet, as Coulanges supposes, the wor- ship of the dead and of fire. This is not primary enough, nor adequate in its range, to account for the result. If we go back to the Aryan ancestry of the Greeks, so far as we can infer their system of morals from the evidence of the Vedic hymns, we find it intimately connected with the religious system of the same hymns, and can hardly explain the origin of either unless by a method which applies as well to those of any people. We must, then, either lose our subject in the general one of the origin of the moral ideas of the race, or confess that we cannot find any other source for those of the Greeks than the earliest religious system of the Indo-European family. II. What was the history of Greek morality in the time known to us ? Did it make progress up or down in that time ? The materials for this investigation, arranged in the order of their value, are (I) inscriptions and contemporary monumental records of all kinds; (2) institutions and customs made known to us in literature; (3) recorded incidents of private or public life in which a moral character can be clearly perceived; and (4) deliberate expressions of moral and religious feeling by poets and philosophers. Of this last source of information too much is usually made. It is of the smallest value in deter- mining the moral ideas of the common people, because these writers are picked men, often out of harmony with the moral tone of the community, and because in their writings they are seen at their own highest moral pitch. If we look at a part of the time known to us, between the Homeric and the Periklean period, we may justly say that there is evidence of an improvement in morals. Three par- 7</page><page sequence="8">Proceedings of tize ticulars are mentioned by Grote in which this is seen, - the position of orphans, the way of dealing with homicide, and the treatment of enemies slain in war. The same progress may also be seen in outward respect for family ties, in the rights of property, in business transactions, and in courage as shown in war. All these are matters which show an increased sense of society as having claims on the individual and doing work for him. On the other hand, in some respects there is a decline in moral tone. On the position of women and of slaves, the progress of civilization seems to have pressed to their disadvantage. The ideal of individual character seems to be higher in the Homeric poems than later; but this may be due largely to the freedom of the poet in shaping his ideal; and if we combine the Hesiodic poems with the Homeric in forming our con- ception of the heroic age, the difference between it and the historic age becomes less. Some of the proximate causes of this improvement in morals may be easily seen; but it is not so easy to say what was the ultimate cause which made the movement to be for a time upward and not downward. It seems there was something in the stock and surroundings of the Greeks which enabled them to build up a system of usages and principles which supported and shaped, with- out hampering, the character of the individual. III. How good was their morality at its best ? Two cautions are to be observed here. (i) We must not think of the Greeks as precisely like ourselves, and to be judged by the same standard. (2) We must not think of them as wholly different from ourselves. In many respects their civilization was strikingly like ours. In theory their moral system was much the same. Truth, courage, patriotism, and all such virtues are praised and the opposite vices condemned through all their literature. In other respects, such as bodily purity, the per- mission of revenge, the inculcation of charity and the passive virtues, there was a difference. As to the degree to which their theories were realized in practice as compared with the same thing in modern times, we need more thorough study of the facts before we can venture an opinion. IV. What was the inzfluence of the Greek religion upon morality ? Here there is great difference of opinion. In some things we see direct influence of re- ligion to enforce duties of universal morality, - for instance, in the sanctity of oaths, the condemnation of suicide, the dread of the sin of 0jpt,s, the duties of hospitality, and pity for suppliants; but it appears that the two ideas " We must do what is right " and " Let us worship and obey the gods " were not by the mass of men consciously and fully recognized as connected, any more than they are always in modern times. There was something, too, in their religion which made the separation of these ideas easy and natural. V. What was the character of the religion of the Greeks ? Many unwarranted assertions are made on this subject. It is difficult to estimate fairly the charac- ter of any religion, but especially so in this case; for the Greek religion had no accepted standards, was always admitting new elements, had grown out of an unrecorded past, and embraced great varieties of belief and feeling. It needs to be studied historically, for it was continually changing. We must go back as far as we can, and this brings us again to the Vedic hymns. We find there a worship-of the powers of earth and air, with constant personification but imper- fect anthropomorphism, and a high but wavering idea of the divine character. It is probable that the early Greeks inherited some form of this system, though exactly what form we cannot ascertain. The Sanskrit names Varuna and Dyaus 8</page><page sequence="9">American Philological Association. are plainly the same with the Greek Oupavds and ZEW1s. To this system the Greeks made additions,--some derived from foreign lands, as Dionysos ; some of native origin, as Peitho, Metis, etc. A frequent cause of the multiplication of deities was the separation of the people into small communities, and their subsequent combination into larger aggregates. Then also, in the exercise of both logic and imagination, the Greeks went further than most peoples in the process of anthropomorphism, to which their skill in the plastic and pictorial arts gave powerful assistance. As the social status of the people improved, their ideas' of the gods were correspondingly elevated. To this the oracle at Delphi and the tragic poets of Athens contributed their influence. Especially the Apolline doctrine of atonement is the highest point of practical religion attained by the Greeks. After the time of Plato came a decline, but not so sudden and com- plete a decline as we are apt to suppose. This bare outline, if correct, shows clearly that many current statements about the Greek religion are untenable. It shows that it was not a worship of beauty, nor a worship of nature, nor a simple acting out of human nature unhampered by sense of sin or dread of the future, nor a system of profound truths disguised as fables. From some cause, -we cannot tell certainly what, but perhaps the need of man for some object of wor- ship above him, - the ancestors of the Greeks were led to a system of worship of the powers of nature. This system the tribes that came to Greece brought with them, and in course of time it became localized and humanized and sys- tematized. It was also enlarged on Greek soil by the admission of new deities, both native and foreign, and a theory was formed of a close association of the gods with men. But all along during the time known to us, the conception of these gods was apparently enough above the moral standard of the average man to exert a control over him and lift him up to a higher level. So it was mani- festly in such cases as those of Aeschylos and Plato, who themselves did much to raise the ideas of other men. Thus we see how the religion of the Greeks was elevated by the improvement of the moral character of the people, and how at the same time it helped to elevate the character of the people. The apparent consecration of vice in the worship of Dionysos and Aphrodite needs explanation here. Both these worships were apparently introduced from foreign lands; and in the case of both there is evidence of a time when sobriety and chastity were required of the worshippers. The gross indulgences which became associated with them were not the legitimate product of a distorted idea of religion, but the abuse of a natural and right idea. On the whole, the religion of the Greeks, though when compared with some others it appears wavering in its conception of the divine nature and feeble in direct moral influence, was yet worthy of the name of a religion; that is, it was a system of belief as to the relation of man to the divine being, which influenced him, in his conduct, towards reverence, integrity, temperance, and good-will to his fellow-men. The Association adjourned to 9 o'clock, Wednesday morning. 9</page><page sequence="10">Proceedings of the CLEVELAND, OHIO, Wednesday, July I3, i88x. MORNING SESSION.

The History of the a-vowel from Old Germanic to Modern English, by Dr. Benjamin W. Wells, of the Johns Hopkins Univer- sity, Baltimore. The paper showed both the origin of the a-vowel, and its development at four stages of its history, - the Old Germanic, the Old English, the Middle English, and the New English periods. The Old Germanic a was the product of two sounds, represented in Greek by a and o, and developed in Old English by successive, though often overlapping, changes. First, the sound was modified from bright to dark a, a change found in Old English only before single consonants followed by the dark vowels a, o, u, and before nasals. Examples are: snaca, atol, dagum, mann, nam. After nasals, and occasionally elsewhere, we may find o for a: thus monn, nom, rodor, nosu; other vacillations or irregularities are quite uncommon. This was followed by the lengthening of final a, so hwi. Next, in all cases except those already mentioned, a was raised in tone to ,e. This change was not permanent before h, nor before h, /, or r, -- consonant. Examples are faed, daeg, fseder, aesc. Irregularities in the use of ac are rare. Breaking involves tone-raising, and was perhaps contemporary with it. This changed a to 6a before h, and before h, 1, and r, - consonant, and sometimes before a single consonant followed by o or u. Its cause is the epenthesis of an u-sound, either present in the following syllable or produced by svarabhakti from r, l, or h. The series of sounds was either a, au, ae?, la, or a, ae, ae aeo, ia. Examples are: beadu, geneah, meaht, w6ard, eald. Occasionally we find oa, for instance reord, and sometimes an i before ht, so mihte. Before w the break- ing appears as eaw, for old Germanic aw became auw, which is eaw in Old English. Instances are: breaw, ceaw, heawan, feawe. Occasionally we find eo; so eowe. Contraction of an before a fricative or h to o. was universal. So gos, oder, brohte. When ah (ag) was followed by a vowel it became. ea; so slean, Gothic slahan. The same is true of a before nasals and liquids; so beam, Gothic bagms. Umlaut or i-epenthesis changes a, o, or ,- to e; so menn, net, gest. It changes /a to ie; so ieldra: and ea to ie; so hiege. It changes o to e; so est, ted. A palatal pronunciation of g, c, sc, or sl caused a semi-vocalic sound, like that sometimes heard in sky (skyai), to enter between them and following vowels. This was indicated in Old English by the sign ed for a and ae; eo for a; ie for e; ec for J. It is seldom used regularly. Examples are: sceamu and sceomu, scea- can, ge6ng, scieppan, gea. This was the last modification of Old Germanic a in Old English. Old Eng- lish a always corresponds to Old Germanic a. IO</page><page sequence="11">American Philological Association. II In the Ormulum, the earliest of the larger Middle English documents, all Old English a's are retained, and many new ones caused by tone-sinking from Old English ea, ae, and other sounds. In New English the Old English a is almost always spelled a, but it has six pronunciations. Before all single nasals, liquids, mutes, and fricatives except r, it is pronounced e: for example, lane, tame, ape, late, wade, rake, bathe, behave. Before r, it is pronounced ea: so hare. Before nasals - syllable or + con- sonant, it is pronounced tz: thus ganet, rank, lamb. Before s + consonant, it appears as a: so ass, flask. Before an absorbed w, f, or g, the sound is oa: so awl, hawk, gnaw. A preceding w may modify these sounds to a partially articulated o, as in swan, wander, wash. The New English letter a is frequently used for Old English a, ae, and la, and less commonly for many other Old English vowels. The sound a is the regular representative of Old English ea, eo, and ae, before r + consonant; and of &amp;a, and ae, before silent I followed by m, f, or v. Examples are: hard, cart, starve, half, salve, alms. This sound is the regular representative of Old English ea before fricatives; so path, grass, staff. It is the regular sound for Old English a before s - consonant; so ass, flask. Elsewhere the use of the sound a is uncommon, and subject to special conditions. Full word-lists and details will appear in the Transactions. 6. Comparison of a few Versions in regard to the Precious Stones of the Jewish High-priest's Breastplate, Exodus, xxviii. 17-20, by Professor James S. Blackwell. In order to see whether the character of the precious stones in this passage could be determined with any certainty, I consulted the following versions: the targums of Onkelos and Palestine (with that of Jerusalem), Peshito Syriac, Septuagint, Vulgate, Armenian, modern Arabic by Smith and Van Dyck, and other modem versions in English, German, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Polish, Bohemian, Hungarian, Irish, Welsh, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Hebrew (some of these latter being the authorized standards in their respective countries, and others the productions of evangelists), and the mineralogical works of Nicol, Phillips, Feuchtwanger, Cleaveland, Jameson, and Dana. The result is not very satisfactory. In the first row the first stone (1't) I hold to be carnelian after the Chaldee achmar and akik (so the carnelian is called in Yemen; see Niebuhr, Reisebeschreibung, p. I42). The second (7T3), com- monly taken as topaz, is doubtful. For the third (np')3), I suggest thunderstone (from the stem p'2 'Ito lighten'), which may have been so called from its sup- posed celestial origin, or its talismanic power in protecting from lightning. In the second row the first and third stones (i.3 and or;n) are altogether doubtful; the second (n3D) is generally agreed to be sapphire. In the third row the first stone (Dn0i) is indeterminable; the second (l:ty) is doubtfully rendered agate; and the third (or73ns) almost universally given as amethyst. In the fourth row the first name is variously translated, -it is the doubtful tartessus ('rwln),- and the third (3W') is usually taken to be jasper. Thus, of these eleven, only two can be said to be known with any certainty. In respect to the second stone (D13w) of the fourth row, rendered onyx in the English version, I would hazard the conjecture that it is jade. From the Hebrew</page><page sequence="12">Proceedings of the root, as preserved in the Arabic conjugates, we may infer that the shoham had the following characteristics: It was green, pale, or leek-colored, translucent, and had splinters, or arrow-shapes, on the fresh surface of fracture. The burtl, which is the Chaldee equivalent of the Hebrew shoham, was sometimes strung on strings and girt about the heads of pregnant women, and was probably the n?lrpn Ip S, or stone of resurrection, mentioned in the Talmud (Shab. 66: 2) as being worn even on the Sabbath, that it might prevent miscarriage. The coin ornaments for hair decoration, worn by Syrian women at present, may be a sur- vival of the ancient custom without its ancient significance; or probably its significance remains, and, from the seclusion of Eastern women, and the indis- position of Eastern men to speak of their women, it has escaped the knowledge of travellers. In connection with this it is interesting to note that the peasants of Germany hold the jade celts as having a mysterious power in assisting the birth of children. The jade is also at present used in India, being formed into chains and small plates, and worn as an amulet attached to the neck (Cleaveland's Min- eralogy, p. 358). The jade has all the known characters and uses of the shoham or burzl, and I know of no other stone that has them. It is pale or leek-green; it is translucent, and occasionally partly transparent; it is characterized by white- colored splinters (7ameson's Mineralogy, vol. ii . p. 290); is capable of being pol- ished (Cleaveland, 1. c., p. 337); is susceptible of being cut into any form (Ure's Diet. of Arts, etc., vol. ii. p. 769); and was and is used as an amulet. It is hard enough to scratch glass (Feuchtwanger, 1. c., p. 361), and was doubtless the stone used for incision in embalming, and in circumcision, whence it became vener- able and sacred. It may be in connection with this old employment that it has the name of Egyptian Stone (Pietra d'Egitto) among lapidaries. Jameson (l. c., p. 290) says it is the 5pAat of Theophrastus, which was engraved and used for seals, its impression probably giving a sacred and binding force to contracts (p. 231). That jade was anciently engraved is shown by the remarkable celt brought from Egypt and exhibited in England before the Archaeological Insti- tute in I868. On both faces of the celt are Gnostic inscriptions in Greek, arranged on one face in the form of a wreath. " It was doubtless regarded," says Evans, in his account of it (1. c., p. 55), " as possessed of some mystic power." The wreath-shape recalls the wreaths of burl? worn on the heads of Jewish matrons. A wider search of Jewish records than I have been able to make may throw some additional light upon this obscure subject. Jade seems to be found native only in Eastern Turkistan, in the Himalaya Mountains (Phillips's fMineralogy), and in New Zealand; but it may have been carried westward by commerce or by migrations. The Secretary read a letter, the substance of which is here given, from Dr. Isaac H. Hall, of Philadelphia, Pa. I have paid no little attention, especially while in the East, to the subject of the precious stones of Scripture, and think the (American) Arabic Bible incom- parably the best version of every one of the texts concerning them. Excepting Genesis and Exodus, that Arabic Bible-translation is the work of Dr. Van Dyck. I once asked him if he thought he was much nearer the truth in these matters than the recent commentators. He said that some doubts would probably always be unresolved; but that he had made some improvements which the Occidentals gen- I2</page><page sequence="13">American Philological A ssociation. I3 erally could not well understand. He was familiar with the ancient versions, but he had derived a great deal of help from various Oriental books, and had incorporated the results obtained from them into his Bible. He had gathered all the works he could get on the subject, both printed and manuscript, chiefly the latter, from Egypt to Asia Minor, and from the Mediterranean to Persia, and even further east. The general credit for the Arabic Bible belongs to Dr. Van Dyck; but for Exodus, where many names for precious stones occur, Dr. Eli Smith, who translated that book, must have equal credit with Dr. Van Dyck. The Arabic lexicons do not help very much to an understanding of the terms employed in this translation, unless one has had some practice in the Arabic technical literature. If a man like Dozy, of Leyden, should get up a lexicon of the Arabic precious stones, it might be very useful. I imagine that no great aid to an interpretation is to be had from the versions, except the Septuagint and Peshito Syriac, and their defects are known in this matter. The very modern versions ought to be better, but I think that some of the better modern com- mentators are better than the versions, excepting the Arabic Bible. 7. On Mixture in Language, by Professor W. D. Whitney. Professor Miiller, in the first series of his Lectures on Language, lays it down as an " axiom " that a mixed language is an impossibility. By a mixed language, however, he does not mean one with mixed vocabulary, since mixture of this kind is well-nigh or quite universal; he holds, rather, that languages, "though mixed in their dictionary, can never be mixed in their grammar; " and by " gram- mar," as thus used, he means only the inflectional system, of declension and con- jugation. Muller's doctrine accordingly may be thus expressed: i. There is a part of a language, namely its inflectional system, which appears to be inac- cessible to mixture; 2. in virtue of this, a mixed language is an impossibility; 3. hence, the unmixableness of language is an axiom of linguistic science. On the other hand, Professor Lepsius, in his Nubian Grammar (Introduction, p. lxxxv.), says: "It is at present an assumption usually made, that the vocabu- lary of one language may indeed to a great extent be transferred to another, but not its grammatical forms and their use. The linguistic history of Africa . . . shows this to be a prejudice." Such a sharp contrast of views seems to make it desirable to submit the subject to a new and careful consideration. This was attempted in Professor Whitney's paper, which reached the following princi- pal conclusions: There is nothing in the least axiomatic about the unmixableness of a language, or of any part of it; so far as properly held, this doctrine is only an induction from the facts of language-mixture, as observed by us in a certain number of cases; and such cases, though tolerably numerous and varied, are far from representing all the possible circumstances of mixture; nor has the mode of working of the forces concerned been clearly enough demonstrated to give the principle any other than an empiric character, applicable to cases analogous with those already observed. Lepsius, then, although not justified in calling it an " assumption " and " prejudice," may prove to be in the right in claiming that it should not be brought up in bar of his theory as to the relationships of African languages. When the speakers of two diverse tongues are brought into contact or commingled with one another, the great possible variety of linguistic results</page><page sequence="14">Proceedings of the may be rudely classified under three heads: I. Each tongue maintains itself nearly unchanged, and the community, or a part of it, becomes bilingual, as at present in the border-lands of Arabic and Turkish and Iranian speech. 2. One tongue, remaining almost unmixed, crowds the other out of existence, as in the Latinized countries of southern Europe. 3. A notably mixed tongue arises, like the English. And where this last is the result, it appears everywhere that the borrowing language takes in the material of the other as crude material, and proceeds to use it according to the rules of its own grammar. It does not by a first process import the structure of the other language. So far as this goes, Miiller's dogma, though no axiom, has a certain truth. But the material thus borrowed may, by a secon- dary process, work itself into any part of the structure of the borrowing language that is still in a formative, growing condition; and in this way every part of the latter is capable of becoming mixed. Thus, in English, such pairs aspure and purity being numerously imported, they come to be regarded in the same light as good and goodness; and the foreign ity is then used, like the native ness, and for the same reason, in making new derivatives. And this and its like has gone on upon such a scale in English that, since the apparatus of derivation is just as much a part of grammatical structure as is that of inflection, English cannot justly be declared unmixed in its grammar; so that the "axiom " is not even strictly true as a fact. It is conceivable, moreover, that cases enough like phenomenon and phenomena, and stratum and strata should be imported to introduce a foreign mode of plural-making. And such numeral words as second, and such indefinite pronouns as one (in one says, etc.), and such frequent and indispensable parts of the apparatus of sentence-making as the adverb-preposition around and the con- junction because, further show how deeply, by the ordinary processes of linguistic growth, elements of foreign origin can be brought into the formal parts of a language. It seems, then, that the special conditions of each separate case of mixture have to be carefully considered in determining the possible effects of mixture: and especially, the condition of a borrowing tongue in respect to its capacity - that is, its habits - of growth. What is most to be avoided is the assumption, which many are ready to make, that when two languages are brought face to face, one of them notices and is inclined to imitate the habits of the other. 8. On the Language of the Isle of Man, by Mr. W. S. Kerruish, of Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Kerruish, to whom the Manx Gaelic was a vernacular, explained the divi- sions of the Keltic family, the place of the Manx in the Gadhelic division (beside the Scotch Gaelic and the Irish), and its diversity from the languages of the other division, the Kymric (including Welsh, Breton, Cornish, etc.). The paper discussed Manx orthography and phonetics, initial inflection of nouns, and the conjugation of verbs. It also gave some specimens of Manx poetry. A recess was taken until afternoon. 14</page><page sequence="15">American Philological Association. I5 CLEVELAND, OHIO, Wednesday, July 13, 188i. AFTERNOON SESSION. The Association was called to order by the President, Professor Packard, at 4.15 P. M. The Auditing Committee reported that the accounts of the Treas- urer had been compared with the vouchers and found correct. The report was accepted. The Secretary, Professor Lanman, made a report of further busi- ness transacted by the Executive Committee. [Cf. page 3.] d. It had been voted to report to the Association for action at the next annual meeting (see page 40- Article VI. of the Constitution), an amendment to the Constitution, proposed by Professor T. D.

There shall be an annual fee of three dollars [instead of five, as now,] from each member. e. It had been voted to lower the price of complete sets of the Transactions from two dollars a volume to one dollar a volume. f. The following new members had been elected: Mr. W. S.

The Executive Committee returned the resolutions touching the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (page 4), with the recommendation that they be passed. These resolutions were laid before the Association. Professor March, while admitting the gravity of the evil arising from the abuse</page><page sequence="16">Proceedings of the of the power to confer degrees, thought the contemplated action lay without the proper sphere of the Association. Professor Gilder- sleeve coincided with Professor March. Professor J. W. White gave some illustrations of the way in which the degree is now con- ferred. He urged that some protest ought to be raised against the practice, and that there were no non-local organizations in the country from whom such a protest could come with more propriety or with less danger of invidious reception. The question being put, the resolutions were passed. The President appointed as a committee of three to confer with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Pro- fessor John Williams White, Professor Charles R. Lanman, and Professor Irving J. Manatt. The Curator of the Association, Professor Lanman, made a report as a matter of record. There were in his charge at Cambridge, Mass., two chests containing Proceed- ings and Transactions, records and correspondence, and sundry books that had been given to the Association; further, there was in the Watkinson Library Building at Hartford, Conn., a considerable stock of the publications of the Association; and, finally, there were a few of the same publications at New Haven, Conn., in the care of Professor Whitney and Mr. Addison VanName. On motion, the President appointed a committee, consisting of Professors March, J. W. White, and T. D. Seymour, to nominate officers for the ensuing year. On motion, Professors Whitney, D'Ooge, and Toy were appointed a committee to recommend a suitable time and place for the next meeting. The Vice-President, Professor F. D. Allen, of Harvard Univer- sity, then took the chair and the reading of papers was resumed. 9. The Use of Abstract Verbal Nouns in Thucydides, by Dr. E. G. Sihler. One of the most striking features of the style of Thucydides is his tendency towards condensation; and this is particularly observable in his use of verbal nouns in -ais. Such nouns occur, roughly speaking, 400 times. A few of them had obtained general currency before the time of this historian, - for example, 6/ts, 'rdis, sundry compounds of -oacns, rpo'paa-s, etc. The great majority of them, however, are distinctly Thucydidean. Stahl's edition contains 471 pages. Using this as a basis of calculation, these verbals occur, on the average, once in IA pages of text. The average amount of text in which one occurrence is found, is, for the several books, as follows: for book i., ix pages; ii., I1; iii., ; iv., I ; v., i*; vi., ij; vii., J; viii., 2. Comparing these with the general average, I*, i6</page><page sequence="17">American Philological Association. I7 the diversities are, on the whole, too small to warrant any inferences as to the stylistic development of Thucydides, although the last book may possibly have been less thoroughly worked over into the characteristic diction of the author. In respect of function and usage these nouns show differences sufficient to be made the basis of their classification. They are found: i. As substantives, pure and simple; as subject, or object, or predicate-noun; and in prepositional phrases. 2. With a genitive objective attached. Here their verbal force is well main- tained. 3. Introducing constructions such as would properly follow a verb. 4. In dependence upon a genitive subjective or possessive. 5. In periphrases with wrole7oOat, yt'yvea'Oa, e'Xv, lrapf'xet, etvat. I. They are employed with concrete force; as, 7rKtA7)rots, equivalent to $vo,a, i. 3. 2. This is especially the case in couplets; e. g. Kcal Xtiuevao Kal ebp/faL770tv, vi. 48. Double compounds occur; as, vpoefECsd77Tfl , v. II. 2. Modified by an attributive of some complexity, these verbals make a very concise phrase; thus, 8a&amp; r^v cK Tris AevKcdos a&amp;vax&amp;ptfiwv, iii. 102. 3. The verbal sometimes replaces a subordinate clause; as Sect&amp;s 'rv 8GwZLv, iii. 33. I. 2. This class comprises I25, or nearly one third of the whole. Here the word in -ass retains the active function of a verb, and also, as a noun, admits of precise determination of its logical relation to the leading clause or word. This relation may be: temporal, as, /er&amp;a 'IhMov ahAwawv, i. 12. 3; instrumental, as, Xpvu-,v TeT- -r(yw)v ve'pa-Et, i. 6. 3; final, as, i/!ylaXoos f-yevideOa . . . E'r' iAevOefpaol?, etc., iii. IO. 3. 3. The verbal introduces an indirect question (i. 73. 3) or an object clause (i. 132. 5), Kara'&amp; y'vOAi)-[iv -Tva Sri, ITh. The future infinitive occurs twice with 65Kdhnos. The dative of interest is found with carTasovh'woas. The genetivus privandi of a-repfEZv is maintained with o'rpfplas, ii. 63. I. 4. Under this head fall about 42 cases. Here double compounds are frt, quent; as opys4(6feJvo' Tr 7rpoavaXcp.fetoE T7oJ MaKic8vwov, iv. 128. 4. Genitives subjective and objective are combined at vii. 34. 6. A number of nouns assume a concrete sense (e. g. SdBaass, ' ford '). 5. These verbals occur about 70 times in periphrasis. The verb is vroeo6rOea in nearly half (32) of these instances, and yityvE-Oas in a quarter. The former is used especially in speaking of military movements; as, 7roei7To Trv liwSiv, iii 33- 3. With reference to the use of these verbals, Mr. Sihler compared Thucydides with his predecessors Herodotus and Antiphon, and his successor Xenophon. The eighth book of Herodotus is equivalent to about one sixth of Thucydides. The occurrences of the -oris nouns number 40, and are to those in an equal amount of Thucydides as 3 to 5 But 15 are nouns long in vogue, like ?I4s and cta-s1. The accumulation and insertion of attributives and other modifiers is the feature of Thucydidean diction most strikingly absent in Herodotus. Antiphon's extant works are in bulk rather more than one eighth of Thucydi. des. The verbals occur 38 times, or thrice where Thucydides would use them four times. The percentage of new and original formations is much larger than in Herodotus. The first three books of Xenophon's Hellenica equal one fifth of Thucydides. 2</page><page sequence="18">Proceedings of the There are but 25 occurrences; or considerably less than one third as many as Thucydides would have in that space. The variety is limited and nouns like rpJaaars, oardoris, 7rpait, Kpaois, and cpoa-os make up most of the count. A very small number of free formation are noteworthy: thus, orr)o'ats, i. 6. 7, and &amp;avTL'riA7s, iii. 5 5. io. On the Vowel-scheme of Melville Bell, by Professor Samuel Porter, of the National Deaf-mute College, Washington, D. C. The main aim of this paper was to offer suggestions in the way of supplement to and rectification of the vowel-scheme of Mr. Bell, -as the same is set forth, in a slightly modified form, by Mr. Henry Sweet, in his Handbook of Pho- netics. One thing to be desired is a more,precise description of the articulating organs, and of the oral configuration for the several vowels. The forward boundary of the guttural passage needs to be defined, not only as made by the division be- tween soft and hard palate, above, but also, on the sides, by the inner and anterior edge of the ascending branch of the lower jaw, behind which line the guttural passage widens out and thus makes a compartment which is, or may be, distinctly separated from the rest of the oral cavity. Again, it needs to be noticed that, as the dome of the hard palate widens in receding from the front and the tongue also widens from the point backwards, the passage made by applying the tongue to the palate at different points, in the positions for i, e, a,, respectively, would naturally differ in breadth. On the soft palate also, there would be a similar difference for u, o, and a. Again, not only the place of greatest constric- tion between tongue and palate should be noted, but the mode of formation (and hence the position and limit) of the resonance-chamber forward of this place needs to be distinctly described. This (for non-labials, and as an inner chamber for labialized vowels,) is made by the tongue flaring away from the palate. It is closed on each side by contact of margin of tongue with palate or with the walls of the guttural passage; and its forward limit is just where this contact ends. Thus, the place of constriction forming, as it were, the neck of a bottle, the resonance-chamber in question would be the flaring mouth of the bottle. It is important in every case to note the limit of this resonance-chamber. Another cavity, answering to the body of the bottle, lies back of the place of constriction; but this probably contributes far less to the quality of the vowel. Instead of variation of tongue-position "horizontally" for the "back," "front," and "mixed," and "vertically" for the "high," "mid," and "low" vowels, these differences are, in fact, all made alike by horizontal variation. This is virtually admitted by Mr. Sweet (Handbook, page 211). Outer and inner would thus seem more appropriate terms than " high " and "low." The a (in father) is wrongly placed as " mid-back-wide ;" and should be set by itself, for reasons to be stated further on. And, for the mixed vowels, a dual instead of the threefold division is sufficient. Thus we should have nine leading vowel positions :- three front, i, e, ' ; two mixed, eu and e2 (as in leur and jezne, French);* three back, u, o, d (as in all) ;- these eight having, in this order, the place of constriction and also the limit of the resonance-chamber re- * Bell and Sweet regard the eu French, not as a "mixed" vowel, but as an e labialized. Of course, it is a labial anyway. I8</page><page sequence="19">American Philological Association. I9 ceding further and further by eight successive steps ; - the three front positions being under the hard palate; the three back on the soft palate and limited en- tirely to the guttural passage; and the eu, of the mixed, limited to the guttural passage, while the eu reaches over across the division between soft and hard palate; the ninth, the a, is to be described below. For the back vowels, the axis of the resonance-chamber inclines more and more upward from a to u; for the mixed, points directly forward; and for the front, inclines downward. The difference between the "narrow" (or "primary ") and the "wide," as it is in fact, and as described by Mr. Sweet (Handbook, page 9), would better be designated by the terms close and open. It makes the difference between the quality of the long i, e, ae, u, o, a, and eta, respectively, and, on the other hand, the quality we give to the corresponding English short and stopped vowels. Of this difference, there may with advantage be noted, not merely two, but, for the seven vowels just named, as many as four degrees, which may be designated as the close, the half-open, the open, and the open-depressed. We need the second, the half-open, for the quality given to the short vowel in the Continental languages generally, the same which we hear in the attempts of foreigners and of Scotch- men to pronounce the short stopped vowels in English. Sometimes, also, to mark the quality of a vowel in unaccented syllables. Also, for the terminal part of our long i and of our ou diphthong. The open-depressed occurs in a drawling pronunciation of our short vowels, that is still habitual to some extent in New England, and elsewhere also, and perhaps may be heard almost anywhere oc- casionally in some such words as " Well " and " Yes." Without any such inele- gance, it may be employed on these vowels in the way of emphasis. Tongue- depression is a natural attendant on the nasal twang, as this draws forward the soft palate, opening the way to the nose. That the eu should admit of four degrees (the fourth being made by depression from the u in up, but), while the eu (of which our earth and bird are non-labial forms) can admit of not more than two degrees at the most, is because the eu position is wholly within the guttural passage, thus allowing range of tongue-movement vertically, while for the eu, the position reaching further forward, there can be no such movement without break- ing the lateral contact entirely. The eu4 is the initial of our long i and our diphthong ou. The a is to be set apart from the other vowels, for the reason that the place of constriction is not on tongue and palate at all; but the constriction is between the epiglottis, or the part of the tongue just above the epiglottis, and the back wall of the pharynx. Sounding this vowel on a low pitch, we can easily produce a decided trill from the epiglottis; and more or less of a fricative quality from this source is always to be distinguished in this vowel. On the other hand, in the 8, o, and u vowels, there is always more or less of a peculiar quality that pro- ceeds from the soft palate, and that is not perceptible at all in the true a vowel. The evidence of the ear, that of the eye, and that of the touch,- all go to exclude this vowel from the category of the d, o, u. Again, the a differs from all other vowels in this, that, in their case (laying out of account now the fourth degree), the open is naturally shorter than the close, and the short tends to be less close than the long; while for the a the reverse is the fact, the tongue is raised for the shorter and is depressed for the longer form of this vowel. For a test, compare the different a's in the French.</page><page sequence="20">Proceedings of the Placing the a thus by itself, we have the only arrangement that is in accord- ance with facts in the history of language. We have it in a position from which there is an easy, and physiologically perfectly natural, transition both to the front vowels under the hard palate and up along the back series on the soft palate. To locate it as "mid-back-wide" is to put it out of all such relation. Mr. Sweet (History of English Sounds, p. 28) has accordingly been led to assign as the point of divergence, not a proper a vowel, but an d, the "low-back-wide," the " Scotch short a in man;" which, in fact, has no direct relation of easy transition with any front vowel.* It is to be remarked that, for the a vowel, the effective resonance-chamber does not extend forward of the boundary of the guttural compartment. This is proved by uttering, as may be done, a clear and proper a with the tongue retracted within this boundary. It is claimed as a merit on the part of the Bell system that it does not assume a correspondence between acoustic and physiologic characters; that is to say, it admits, and contends, that sounds presenting similarity may proceed from quite dissimilar organic adjustments, - that thus, for instance, the French peur is liable to be confounded with the English purr. But, if the vowel in peur is really spoken, in the way Mr. Sweet thinks correct, as a labialized e, it will hardly, in fact, be confounded with or likened to the u in purr. And, at all events, it is only so far as sound corresponds to organic adjustment and action, that a physi- ological scheme of the vowels can have any value whatever. If it were so that precisely the same sound could be produced by two or more different organical instrumentalities, the value of any such scheme would be so far diminished. To deny that there are generic characters of sound that correspond to generic organ- ical characters, would be to detract from the value of the Bell vowel-scheme to an extent doubtless beyond what Mr. Sweet would approve. It is to be noticed that there is a way of adjusting the point of the tongue upon the palate with an effect that shall simulate, though not exactly imitate, that of labial contraction. The two adjustments may even be combined, as they perhaps sometimes are in the French u and eu, or the German u and o. This adjustment is to be carefully distinguished from the resonance-chamber as that exists apart from such modification. These criticisms and the proposed amendments are offered, not with any disposition to disparage the work of Mr. Bell and of Mr. Sweet, but in hearty recognition of the eminent service they have rendered to phonetic science, and with the view of contributing to the correction of what, if they are defects, could not fail to hinder the full and final success of the scheme to which these gentle- men have given so much of their labor.

The Association came to order at 9.I5 A. M. The minutes of Wednesday's sessions were read by the Secretary, and approved. Remarks upon Professor Porter's paper were made by Dr. B. W. Wells and Professor Whitney. The reading of communications was resumed. ii. On Latin Pronunciation, by Professor M. M. Fisher, of the University of Missouri. This was presented by his colleague, Pro- fessor Blackwell. The author criticised the "Roman" or "Restored" method, claiming that it could never be taught with uniformity inasmuch as its ablest advocates differed widely in regard to its details. He argued that the true ancient pronunciation could never be positively and fully known, and that, from practical considera- tions, it was better to adhere to the English system of pronouncing Latin. Dr. Sihler spoke of the agreement of the best German authorities in regard to the general correctness of the Roman or historical method. Professor J. B. Weston, of Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio, said that men did not agree respecting all sounds in English, and that a disagreement concerning a few sounds in the Roman pronun- ciation did not militate against its adoption. as a system. Moreover, it was better to be near the truth than far from it. 2. What is Articulation? by Professor Whitney. The word "articulate" is generally used as distinctively descriptive of human speech; but for the most part without any clear idea of what it really means, or why human speech should be designated in this particular way. And this un- clearness is found not only in popular use, but in that of scientific treatises, even those of a high class. In Sievers's Lautphysiologie, for example, "articulation" is defined and used in a way that makes it the precise equivalent of "utterance," voluntary production of sound by a living creature, whether human or other than human. Is this authorized, or to be approved? The term goes back to the Greek E'apOpos, which means 'jointed,' and is used primarily of physical jointing, as that of a limb, or of a stalk of grass. The cor- responding noun and verb are v'dpOpwpis and &amp;SdpOpwwoss, and 8tapO8po. These are rendered by the Latin articulo, denominative of articulus, 'joint,' and its vari- ous forms and derivatives. 2I</page><page sequence="22">Proceedings of the Now articulation in this its literal sense, of jointedness, is in very truth the characteristic of human speech-utterance, distinguishing it from other varieties of human utterance, as laughing, crying, groaning, yelling, etc., and from all brute utterance. Speech moves on by a succession of similar parts, separate but joined on to one another-namely, syllables. Articulation is virtually syllabica- tion,-a breaking of the stream of utterance into joints, by the intervention of closer utterances, or consonants (only exceptionally of hiatus), between the opener utterances, or vowels. The essence of articulation lies not in the mode of production of the individual sounds, which is virtually alike in all animals possessing voice, but in the mode of their combination. We recognize this mean- ing plainly enough still, in saying that a person "articulates well," when the transitions between vowel and consonant elements are clearly made; or in accus- ing of bad articulation a singer who slurs the consonants and hardly utters any but vowel tones, or a mumbling indistinct speaker. Articulation in this sense is a still higher characteristic of speech, inasmuch as it is an acquired one, coming with the historical development of speech. We have every reason to believe that the first significant uttered elements were monosyllables, earlier open ones, perhaps later in part closed ones (this is a disputed point). In this stage lan- guage was not properly articulate; each utterance was a simple isolated voice- gesture, in meaning equivalent to a whole sentence. But such an isolated utter- ance was made complicate, in part by repetition or reduplication, in part by combination with other like utterances: this combination being either syntacti- cal, as now in Chinese, so that each sentence became an articulated whole, each joint having its own meaning and motion, or, on the other hand, in part also agglutinative, so that each word became an articulated whole, its members hav- ing each its own part to play as a joint, and the sentence became a jointed entity of double complication. Our own children have to go through a similar course: they begin with simple utterances, and with isolated ones, learning later, by prac- tice, to joint these on to one another in an unbroken articulated succession. And the organs of the lower animals are not incapable of producing single sounds like enough to ours; but those animals are incapable of the development which would lead them to combined articulated utterance. It appears, then, as if the Greeks made one of their very happiest hits, showed their genius for observation and distinction at its best, in calling human utter- ance 'jointed;' no other term could so well describe its phonetic character, nor be so deeply founded in its history. It is a great pity if we cannot show the secondary ability to understand what they meant, and to keep the word to its true value. If there really is no available German word for 'utter,' and arziculate must hence be reduced to that sense in German use, let it be done at least with the confession and excuse of poverty, and not as if no degradation of the word, but only a proper continuation of it in its ancient significance, was implied in such use. 13. On the Origin of v Movable in Greek, by Professor Fisk P. Brewer, of Iowa College, Grinnell, Iowa. The origin of v movable in Greek seems to have been different after different endings. I. In third-singulars in -e. Here the view of Deventer is accepted, that the 22</page><page sequence="23">American Philological Association. forms with -v are earlier than those without. Otherwise, the v should appear under similar phonetic conditions after -e in the second person and elsewhere. In the parent speech these forms ended in -r. Deventer supposes that this -T was changed directly to -v, but gives no other instance of such a change. Per- haps the true explanation is that there was an assimilation of the third-singular to the third-plural. When the earliest Greeks began to discard final mutes, and to modify all such words as *-ueTr and *iova-er, they remolded these to eAvev and EAvu-ev, in imitation of the new plurals ending in -ov and -orav. About the same time, probably, the third-plurals assimilated in accent to the third- singulars, *EAVEr and *evovrr, *Auovaer and *A6eravT becoming ixvev and eAvuo, EAvo-ev and Evoaaw. This was not a development of v from T, but a replacement of one letter by the other. The change may have been facilitated by the fact that v or av was in the earliest times a representative of a third-person pronoun in Greek verbal endings, and in later times remained a recognized demonstrative element. N movable in these forms may be considered, then, a personal ending of secondary formation which began to fall away, but was continued in the literary period, subject to phonetic rules for its use and omission. 2. In third-plurals in -a-i. The earlier form was Avovr, which never assumes v. Sdch forms as XAvovor and AvovaL also exist. From these came the ordinary AvovuLv by transfer of the liquid, -vrL changing to -orv. The final v, representing in its original position a third-person pronoun, was unstable in its new place, and became a movable letter. 3. Later all other words in -o- assumed v as a mere phonetic addition, acquir- ing double forms after the analogy already established in the frequently recurring forms of the third plural. ir'TLv seems anomalous, though Deventer considers the termination -arL sufficiently like -a- to have assumed v by the same analogy. It is admitted that the above explanation rests on slender evidence, but it is claimed to accord better with the general process of word-formation than to consider v movable from the beginning a merely euphonic addition. I4. On the Use of 7rptv in the Attic Orators, by Professor B. L. Gildersleeve, of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md. In the introductory part of the paper the author took occasion to show how carelessly and inconsistently the particle had been handled even by leading writers on grammar. The negative element which is involved in Irptv has been overlooked, and false rules for use have been laid down. The difficulty of the combination with irpbv and the infinitive has not been fairly met. As a preposi- tional combination with the infinitive, it is an anachronism, and yet it is hardly explicable on other grounds. After detailed strictures on various points the author proceeded to present, with a few comments, the normal use of 'rprv, with a tabular conspectus of the occur- rences in sentences that might have assumed the finite form; but the examples weigh little in comparison with the whole number, and we are far from the Homeric freedom, - nearer the scenic norm. 7rplv with the infinitive after affirmative sentences is becoming a rule; 7rptv with the indicative after affirma- tive clauses is extremely rare. Perfect infinitive and present infinitive are rare 23</page><page sequence="24">Proceedings of the and carefully used, and there is little good warrant for rpliv 1 or the omission of &amp;v. Of individual peculiarities in the handling there is not much to be said. Isokrates in his more formal orations treats 7rp&amp;repov - Trpiv as he does every- thing else, in the interest of his aesthetic seesaw and fastidious rhythm. There is more masculinity and familiarity in the abrupt use of rpiv, as for instance in Lysias. I5. On the use of the Aorist Participle in Greek, by Professor T. D. Seymour, of Yale College, New Haven, Conn. The aorist participle seems to have no more natural right than the aorist infinitive to the signification of past time. We find examples of this achronic use, e.g., in Homer, 2 2zo, d/Aa 8' helxy Karas&amp;8vVTL I Trvpao re fAXEyY0ouLvv. A paper was presented to this Association at Baltimore in 1877 on the "Temporal Coin- cidence of the Aorist Participle with the Primary Verb," in jfouvae eUaCeqvou, KTA., by Professor Merriam. Although there are many instances to be found of this original use, yet the rule is that the aorist participle regularly refers to an action or state "which is past with reference to the time of the leading verb." An explanation of this may be found by an examination of the different classes of participles. The aorist participle when attributive clearly corresponds to the aorist indi- cative (oVros 6 AvU(ras = o- roS s sAuoe), and as the aorist infinitive refers to past time when it represents the indicative, so naturally is it with the participle. When this participle corresponds to the subjunctive or optative the case is different, as we should expect. The same principle holds with the supplementary participles; XaOev apiK'/Aevos corresponds to a&amp;lcerTO XAapa, i'ruev is8&amp;v to et8ev 'rXP, 7 aiveraL corovudaas to Qalverab g'or trrou'5cae, KTA. In all these instances the participle represents the indicative mood. For the circumstantial participles it is instructive to compare, e. g., Homer, A 149, &amp;s e78ev cutav aiLa l-yna-crv, and 217, brel fSev AKos, '7rl paip/aKca rdatra-, with 279, P(y-eTy Te l 8v. So ei rel raUoavTo trT'ou KTA. would be expressed by most prose writers iravad4evot 7rdvov TcrA. eBaivvvro. It is a commonplace saying that in the English idiom two verbs are used where the Greek preferred a verb and a participle. Thus EfXEro Xepas avre^tSXv is logically though not rhetorically equivalent to av'ovXe XEipas Kal CXeTo, &amp;voIY7 avv6oas to &amp;vvuov Kal &amp;VQiOye; so in Homer, A 85, we have Oapgras tudAca el'r and, 92, 6dp-vae Kal rna. Often the participle corresponds to the subjunctive or the optative mood; so Homer, a I63, e KeivOdv Ye I8oaTro voorffTavrpa KTX. may be resolved into f -ye vocTrf?ele .... WrdVTeS c' aporralar' Xaafpdrepo zr wd8as e?val/, and perhaps Kpooros 6AAvv SiaO&amp;s /e7ydCA71 apXXvi Karaxvael into drv a8ai3j Ktr. In general, however, the aorist participle, whether attributive, supplementary, or circumstantial, represents the aorist indicative, and thus naturally refers to time prior to that of the principal verb. In later Greek, as was to be expected from the predominance of this reference to past time, this participle was used as an absolute past participle. Remarks were made on this paper by Professors Price and Gildersleeve. 24</page><page sequence="25">American Philological Association. I6. Report of the Committee on the Reform of English Spel- ling, by the Chairman, Professor F. A. March, of Lafayette College, Easton, Pa. The Philological Society of England has just issued a pamflet entitled "Partial Corections of English Spellings aproovd of by the Philological Society." These corections ar the result of a discussion introduced by the President, Dr. Murray, in his retiring adress on the 2Ist May, 1880, and con- tinued thru six meetings. Mr. Sweet was authorized to prepare a statement of the results, and this was finaly adopted at a special general meeting on January 28th, I88I. The corections ar made in the interest of etymological and historical truth, and confined to words which the changes do not much disguize from general readers. Your Comittee finds that the corections of the Philological Society's pamflet ar such as ar contemplated in the report of your Comittee of I875, and in subsequent reports; and it recomends the imediate adoption of the following corections which ar therein set forth, and which ar uzed in this report: I. e. - Drop silent e when foneticaly useless, as in live, vineyard, believe, bronze, single, engine, granite, eaten, rained, etc. 2. ea. -Drop a from ea having the sound of e, as in feather, leather,jealous, etc. Drop e from ea having the sound of a, as in heart, hearken. 3. eau. - For beauty uze the old beuty. 4. eo. - Drop o from eo having the sound of e, as injeopardy, leopard. For yeoman write yoman. 5. i. -Drop i of parliament. 6. o.- For o having the sound of u in but write u in above (abuv), dozen, some (sum), tongue (tung), and the like. For women restore wimen. 7. ou. - Drop o from ou having the sound of u, as in journal, nourish, trouble, rough (ruf ), tough (tuf), and the like. 8. u. - Drop silent u after g before a, and in nativ English words, as guarantee, guard, guess, guest, guild, guilt. 9. ue. - Drop final ue in apologue, catalogue, etc.; demagogue, pedagogue, etc.; league, colleague, harangue, tongue (tung). Drop e in argue, ague. Io. y. - Spel rhyme rime. II. Dubl consonants may be simplified: Final b, d, g, n, r, t, f, 1, z, as ebb, add, egg, inn, purr, butt, baili, dull, buzz (not all, hall). Medial before another consonant, as battle, ripple, written (writn). Initial unaccented prefixes, and other unaccented syllabls, as in abbre- viate, accuse, affair, etc., curvetting, traveller, etc. 12. b. - Drop silent b in bomb, crumb, debt, doubt, dumb, lamb, limb, numb,plumb, subtle, succumb, thumb. I3. c.- Change c back to s in cinder, expence, fierce, hence, once, pence, scarce, since, source, thence, tierce, whence.

R. Lounsbury, of Yale College, being added, to serve in place of the late Professor S. S. Haldeman. It now consists of Messrs. Whitney, Child, Trumbull, March, and Lounsbury. It was voted that the reports of the committees on the time and place of the next meeting and on nomination of officers be called for at the beginning of the afternoon session. The Association thereupon took a recess. CLEVELAND, OHIO, Thursday, July 14, i88i. AFTERNOON SESSION. The Vice-President, Professor Allen, called the Association to order at 4 o'clock. Professor March, in behalf of the committee appointed to nom- inate officers for the year I881-82, reported as follows: For President- Professor Frederic D. Allen, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. For Vice-Presidents--Professor Milton W. Humphreys, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tenn.; Professor M. L. D'Ooge, Michigan University, Ann Arbor, Mich. For Secretary and Curator- Professor Charles R. Lanman, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. For Treasurer- Charles J. Buckingham, Esq., Poughkeepsie, N.

Professor William W. Goodwin, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. Professor Thomas R. Price, University of Virginia, Va. Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, Hartford, Conn. Professor William D. Whitney, Yale College, New Haven, Conn. The report was accepted, and the persons therein named were declared elected to the offices to which they were respectively nominated. Professor Whitney reported for the committee on time and place of meeting. It was recommended that the next session be held at Boston, Mass., or some place in its immediate vicinity, on Tuesday, July i , 1882, at 3 P.M. The determination of the precise locality of meeting was left to the Executive Committee. On motion, the report was accepted. At this session, the election of the following members was announced: Professor Irving J. Manatt, Marietta College, Ohio. Professor John L. Johnson, University of MissiLsippi, O.xford, Miss. The reading of papers was resumed. 17. Shemitic or Semitic? by Professor Blackwell. It were much to be desired that some uniformity were prevalent among scholars in the use in the English language of one or the other of the terms " Shemitic" or " Semitic." I believe the time is near at hand when the desirable uniformity will be secured, and when scholars will settle upon Semitic. The defenders of Shemitic have been chiefly, I believe, from the theological side, though Shemitic and Semitic, with a preference for the latter, both occur in Kitto's Bible Cyclopedia, in the able article by Emmanuel Deutsch. Smith's Bible Dictionary dismisses the controversy with the curt and half-indignant statement that "English scholars have lately adopted from the French the form Semitic, but there is no reason why we should abandon the Hebrew sound because the French find the pronunciation difficult." (Vol. IV. p. 2971, note.) Professor Murray (Origin and Growth of the Psalms, p. 2) remarks that "Semitic and Semite, now so much in vogue as to be almost good usage, are survivals of the French nomenclature of the English Orientalists who learned Arabic at the feet of De Sacy." It will be observed that the statement of Smith's Bible Dictionary involves several charges: first, That English scholars have lately adopted Se- mitic; second, That there is no reason why wve should abandon the Hebrew sound; third, That we received Semitic from the French; fourth, That the French find the pronunciation of sh difficult. Professor Murray grants, in addi- tion to the third charge, that Semitic is in "almost good usage." I. With regard to the first charge of Smith's Bible Dictionary, that English 27</page><page sequence="28">Proceedings of the scholars have "lately" adopted Semitic, it may be said that they must have lately adopted it if they were to adopt it at all, using the word " lately " in a broad sense. The term was not in general use until the first quarter of this century, having been used in Germany, as it is alleged, first by Schlozer in I78I, only nineteen years before i8oo. Its use could not, however, have been general, since Eichhorn claims to have introduced it in place of " Oriental " in 1794, and could not have known of any earlier usage. If the English scholars who introduced the objectionable term, learned it, as Professor Murray asserts, "at the feet of De Sacy," they must have used it at its very earliest entrance into speech, for De Sacy was in the prime of his fame in the beginning of this century. In ISoo De Sacy was forty-two years old, had been known as a prominent Arabist since his memoir on the " History of the Arabs before Mohammed," read in 1785, and had been a professor of Arabic for five years. It was in I806 that he was appointed to the professorship of Persian in the College de France, and in the same year appeared his Chrestomathie Arabe, three years before the death of Schlizer, and twenty-one years before the death of Eichhorn. Hence even from the very arguments of the defenders of Shemitic, it may be proved that the term Semitic preceded it in English usage. It would, therefore, be entitled to all the rights which precedence gives, and should not be evicted by Shemitic without some good grounds. Not only so, but the English pupils who had imbibed and assimi- lated the instructions of such a man as De Sacy, would undoubtedly have such rights as are by common consent freely granted to distinguished special learning, and would justly lay a claim to the prerogative, above other men of meaner qual- ifications and less acknowledged authority, of determining and fixing what our usage should be. II. The second point of the remark in Smith's Bible Dictionary is that " there is no reason why we should abandon the Hebrew sound." Shall we then be re- quired to say Shabbfath for Sabbath, Moshe for Moses, Shelach for Salah, Yeru- shalaim for Jerusalem, Sh'altiel for Salathiel, Shom'ron for Samaria, Shimshon for Samson, Sh'muel for Samuel, Shfaul for Saul, Sheth for Seth, Shim'on for Simon, Sh'lomoh for Solomon, Abhshalkom for Absalom, Yeshai for Jesse, Y'shavalhu for Isaiah, M'nassheh for Manasseh, Yeshu'a for Jesus, Shoshannah for Susannah, and Mfashiach for Messiah ? The Jews also are sinners against the rule set up in the Bible Dictionary, for they very usually write Shim'on in the Talmud with a Samekh instead of a Shin, as for instance in the Talmud of Jerusalem, Shab. II: 2, and Berach, 8: I. The very sufficient answer against the enforcement of the implied recommendation of Smith's Bible Dictionary seems to me to be that many of these names have become part and parcel of our speech, and are woven into the woof of our historical and domestic life. Sern stands in the same category, for we find it where we have found the other names, namely in the English Bible, e. g. in Luke 3: 36. To the allegation that there is "no reason " for the adoption of Semitic, I answer again briefly that Semitic appears to me the better term because of the very possibility of its failing to suggest to an English mind the more usual form of the name Shem. 7aphetic is about ob- solete, Hamitic is obsolescent, and Sheritic, founded on error and guarded by prejudice and obstinacy, should follow in the same road. It is possible for Semitic to attain a conventional wide significance, similar to that we attribute to Aryan and Turanian; Shemitic, on the contrary, carries with it the history of a misconception, from which it cannot easily be divorced. 28</page><page sequence="29">American Philological Association. III. The writer of the article "Shemitic Languages" in Smith's Bible Dic- tionary affirms that we received Semitic from the French, and Professor Murray coincides with this statement. No evidence, no reference to any historical document, is cited by either authority. But it is not a necessary conclusion, at all, that we borrowed the term from the French. There were other persons in England besides Coleridge, in the beginning of this century, who, like him, were more or less devoted both to Semitic and to German literature, and who may have seen the word and used it at its earliest invention. Coleridge was twenty- eight years of age in the year I8oo, when Eichhorn's Bibliothek had been six years before the public, and it is not unlikely that he had used the word as early as De Sacy used it. At any rate, that the word Semitic was known to him as early as Feb. 24, 1827, is matter of history, for it occurs in his " Table-talk " of that date. The statement of Smith's Bible Dictionary, therefore, that it has been "lately adopted" from the French, must be modified in so far that the word "lately" may mean fifty years. IV. The Dictionary further affirms that the French find the pronunciation of our sh difficult. We should hardly expect to find anything "sensational" in a Bible Dictionary, but this statement is certainly very remarkable. How a Frenchman would allow himself to be convulsed with such impossible phonetic combinations when he would speak of his chapeau, or of his cheval which draws his chaise along his chemin, is only to be explained by the fact that a Frenchman is to an Englishman past finding out. The Abbe Chiarini, who spells the letter Shin, C-h-i-n, in p. 64 of his Prolegom?nes la version du Talmud, would doubtless have raised in the writer in Smith's Bible Dictionary the notion that the design in this odd orthography was to speak of a part of the human countenance. In conclusion let me note that Professor Murray observes that Semitic is in " almost" good usage. But the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Penny Encyclopedia, the American, and the New American Encyclopedias, and indeed all the large encyclopedias excepting the Edinburgh one; the professors of Oxford and Cam- bridge, notably Professors Max Miiller and Palmer; and indeed all the great scholars and writers of Great Britain, excepting a few like Davidson of obsti- nate Scotland, including the writers of such good English as Gladstone, Ruskin, Beaconsfield, and Fitz-Edward Hall, uniformly and exclusively use Semitic. In this country the usage of such scholars as Robinson, in his Travels and in his translation of Gesenius's Hebrew Lexicon, of Green, in his Hebrew Grammar, of the late Professor Hadley in his Essays, of Whitney and March in their respective Sanskrit and Anglo-Saxon grammars, and of Professor Murray's editor and annotator, make the practice more than respectable. In view of all that has been here urged, it may not improperly be said that the term Semitic is authoritative. I8. The Reading and Interpretation of Verse 572 of the Antigone of Sophocles, by Professor M. L. D'Ooge, Michigan University, Ann Arbor, Mich. Aldus first assigned this line to Antigone, a view since advocated by Boeckh and adopted by the majority of editors. That Boeckh was unduly influenced by the supposed incongruity of the address &amp; fitraO' Afrwv in the mouth of Ismene, is now generally acknowledged. The two principal reasons for giving 29</page><page sequence="30">Proceedings of the 30 the line to Antigone are: (i) If the line is assigned to Ismene, rb tbv hXlos of the next line must mean 'the marriage of which you speak,' which, although admissible so far as use of words is concerned, has no application to what Ismene has just said. (2) As the line stands, it is not what would be expected from Ismene in response to the reproachful observation of Creon, KaK&amp;S fy() yvvauias viearv (rrv-y6. Antigone, and not Haemon, is dishonored (&amp;rtLd'eSl) by this reproach, against which Ismene would be likely to defend her sister. But these considerations, it must be noticed, are objections against assigning the line to Ismene rather than arguments for giving it to Antigone. To suppose the line spoken by Antigone involves, as it seems to me, much graver objections. For, in the first place, we are then to hold that Antigone, who before this had made not the slightest allusion to her relations with Haemon, now so far loses sight of her absorbing devotion to her duty towards her brother, as to resent the imputation that she would be a bad wife for Creon's son. To be sure, Boeckh sees in this ejaculation a kind of magnanimity on the part of Antigone in that she notices the indirect taunt hurled at Haemon rather than the direct one aimed at herself; still, she is moved to break her dignified silence none the less by a re- proach cast upon her A(Xos. The unnaturalness of this is the more apparent when we take into account Antigone's utterance in 56o. But again, to suppose this line spoken by Antigone makes the next line spoken by Creon exceedingly tame. It is hardly in keeping with the proud and indignant temper of Creon to take so little notice of this exclamation (to pay no attention to it at all would suit the situation), if it had fallen from the lips of Antigone. But to settle the inter- pretation of a line by simply weighing objections over against each other, is at best only a choice of evils. Whether the line be assigned to Antigone or to Ismene, it must be confessed that its connection with the context is not readily apparent. To make the connection of this line and of 569 more clear, Nauck proposes to bracket 570 and to transpose 571 and 572, so as to have this order: 569, 572, 57I. According to his interpretation of 572, which he assigns to Ismene, Creon dishonors Haemon by intimating that he will comfort himself for the loss of his bride by finding another in her stead. While thus a better con- nection for 572 is gained, it is at the expense of the clearness of the relation of 571 to the context. Moritz Schmidt, in his recent edition, proposes more radical transpositions, which a sound criticism will be slow to accept. The only point of interest in his emendation is the connection he makes between 567 and 572, which he explains by supposing that a&amp;,TAdCe refers to Creon's disposal of Anti- gone without consulting his son who, having reached his majority, ought to have some voice in the matter. Not to speak of the modernness of this view, its finesse is out of harmony with the simplicity and directness of Ismene's character. To remove the objections urged above against assigning 572 to Ismene, and to make apparent the connection of this line with the next following, I venture to propose a much simpler remedy, to wit, a change of &amp;-' to o04' in 572. The line would then read: 'O0, dearest Haemon, how your father dishonors her' (i. e. Antigone), by calling her KaKd .yyv,j for you his son. The omission of the article or pronoun with 7rar'4p is no objection, and the use of mopt in Tragedy, when no deictic force is intended, is- common enough. The disappearance of the /f from o0' is quite similar to the omission of S' in 0. C. 1363, ec a'Oe?v 8' &amp;xaAwtyos, or of 6' in 0. C. 1012, 4vusAdaous O' lv' KtjcpOys. With this reading we first get a clear view of what is referred to by &amp;arsdCets,</page><page sequence="31">American Philological Association. 31 and a fair connection for the next following line. Now Creon says, with mani- fest allusion to the exclamation of Ismene: Stop, you and this marriage to which you have been referring (just now and in 568 and 570) are provoking me beyond endurance. For this reference of rb abv AE'Xos we have proof in the scholium on this line: rb obv, rb vb arou ? vooP a oCrevov oTov, Tb 5voAl.a r7js vufLjxs t aob ipo3Bdcip. From this scholium the proposed emendation receives inferential evidence; for, while the name of the bride is not mentioned in this connection, the proposed f&gt;e' adds to the clearness of the reference. I9. A Confession about Othello, by Professor March. The scenes in which Iago moves Othello to jelousy seem to me unnatural. I hav tried since my boyhood to make them seem natural, but I hav not suc- ceeded, -that is my confession. If we compare the jelousy of Leontes we find it natural though utterly ground- less. It springs from temperament and mood in Leontes. But in Othello the attempt is made to show us a man, not jelous in himself, convinced by testimony and reasons that he has cause for jelousy. His own view of his wife presents her to him in perfect purity. We ar to believ him overpowerd by reasons. There is great elaboration of the steps of Iago's procedure to convince him. We ar led therefore to scrutinize them, and we must see they amount to nothing. How could any man like Othello be moved by such tricks and trifles? It is possibl, to be sure, that a man should hav such perfect confidence in another as to accept his views without good reasons. If we ar to recognize such a friendship between Othello and Iago, grounds for it should be shown in the character of Iago in the earlier part of the play. But he is exhibited as a rascal, and a gross one, from the first. It is hard to think of such shallow rascality, so obtrusively set forth at every turn, as deceiv- ing any one: Was there some actor of Shakespeare's time who had a natural ex- pression of superhuman trustworthiness, some unimaginabl "confidence man," looking on whom the theater coud believ that any Othello must trust him in everything? Or has Shakespeare for once lowerd his genius to giv the actors an opportunity to show off their power of depicting changes of mood and passion too artificial for nature ? On motion of Professor Toy, it was Resolved, That the following minute be put on the Records, and be sent to the gentlemen here mentioned: The American Philological Association desires to express its hearty thanks to the Board of Education of Cleveland for the use of their Assembly Room, to the representatives of the Cleveland Leader and of the Cleveland Herald for their careful reports of the proceedings, to the officers of the Union Club for the gen- erously offered privileges of their Club House, and to Mr. Charles W. Bingham, Mr. W. S. Kerruish, Dr. H. H. Powell, and especially to Mr. E. P. Williams, for their kindness in making the needed arrangements for the meeting, and for the pleasant ride and collation provided by them. The minutes of Thursday's sessions were read and approved. On motion, the Association then adjourned.</page><page sequence="32">CHARLES J. BUCKINGHAM, Treasurer, in account with the AMERICAN PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION, yuly 13, I88o- uldy I2, i88i. DR. CR.

The first volume will not be sold separately. TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN THE PRICE OF COMPLETE SETS. Single COMPLETE SETS of the Transactions will be sold, until further notice, at twelve dollars a set. It is especially appropriate that American Libraries should exert themselves to procure this series while it may be had. It is the work of American scholars, and contains many valuable articles not elsewhere accessible; and, aside from these facts, as the first collection of essays in general philology made in this country, it is sure to be permanently valuable for the history of American scholarship. 45</page></plain_text>
