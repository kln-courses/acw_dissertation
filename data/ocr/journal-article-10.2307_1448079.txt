You're at a party with mostly nonbi- ologists, and the conversation eventually comes around to what you do for a living. You respond accordingly, only to find your listeners staring back at you, amused and somewhat puzzled. "Seriously?" they ask. "Fish behave?" St6phan Reebs, in Fish Behavior in the Aquari- um and in the Wild, provides a delightful, brief, and accessible answer to any who may doubt the complexity and sophistication of the behavior of fishes. As he states in the first paragraph of the preface, "there is no reason to expect that fish behavior should be any less diverse, sophisticat- ed, and interesting than that of birds, for ex- ample, a class of animal whose behavior has been more thoroughly examined" (p. vii). Of course, Reebs is likely to be preaching to the choir, as the most probable readership will be a mix of avid aquarists and academic ethologists. No matter, it is hard to imagine a more enthu- siastic and devoted choir. The stated purpose of the book is to "popu- larize those facts about fish behavior that are hidden in the scientific literature or are not im- mediately apparent in the descriptive popular literature" (p. ix). To that end, the author does an excellent job of translating into lay terms not only the results but also the objectives, meth-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 537 odology, and wider relevance of a broad range of behavioral research. Reebs makes the prac- tice of science both readable and accessible, of- ten encouraging aquarists to try ethological ex- periments at home. Yet, despite this firm grounding in research and analysis, the author never loses his sense of passion and wonder for the remarkable and often unexpected capabili- ties of fishes. The book consists of three main sections. The first, "Sensory Abilities," addresses four main sensory modes of fishes in as many chapters: olfaction, hearing, the lateral line, and electric- ity/magnetism. In these chapters, recent as well as classic examples from the primary literature are used to describe how fishes glean informa- tion from their environment. Special emphasis is placed on the fact that fishes are able to sense their environment through channels wholly for- eign to humans (see Chapters 3 and 4). The second section, "Cognitive Abilities," is split into four chapters on learning, telling time, in- dividual recognition, and gauging predators and adversaries. The last section consists of three chapters on "Choosing Abilities," includ- ing mate choice, shoal choice, and making com- promises. (The author does not explain, nor is it clear to me why choosing should be addressed separately from other cognitive abilities, except perhaps for the disproportionate amount of lit- erature devoted to the former.) As in the first section, facts about the cognitive abilities of fish- es are presented in tandem with careful expla- nation of the experiments from which they were derived. The scope of research covered in this brief volume is generally broad, encompassing a wide range of the ethological literature. Studies from a number of laboratories are described in de- tail, and equal attention is given to both fresh- water and marine fishes. Unlike most compre- hensive reviews of fish ethology, which are pre- sented as edited volumes (e.g., Noakes and Ward, 1981; Pitcher, 1986; Huntington and Tor- ricelli, 1993; Godin, 1997), Reebs' solo-au- thored account is easily read cover-to-cover, al- though perhaps sacrificing some of the breadth achieved in larger works. In this manner, it is reminiscent of Curtis' The Life Story of the Fish (1949), for which the intended audience was also a mix of laity and academicians. However, attention to the details of specific studies makes Reebs' book more similar in scholarship to that of Keenleyside's Diversity and Adaptation in Fish Behaviour (1979). Clearly, single-authored re- views of the ethological literature are few and far between, and Reebs' stands out for its com- bination of both readability and scholarship, as well as for its particular emphasis on cognitive abilities. My main criticisms include the absence of a chapter on vision in the first section. The au- thor omits it because he believes "the visual abilities of fishes are not counterintuitive enough or noticeably better than our own...." I suspect many who study the visual systems of fishes would take exception to such a statement. Fishes exhibit a wide variety of visual structure and function, the properties of which appear to be finely tuned to their various environments (see Nicol, 1989). Certainly the diversity of fish visual systems far exceeds our own. Further- more, omitting such a chapter fails to convey the importance of vision and visual communi- cation in the lives of fishes. There is also a tendency for the author to succumb to an adaptationist paradigm. In some cases, he goes so far as to surmise that a partic- ular behavior will garner its effector a higher relative fitness, despite a lack of data to support such a claim. There are two problems with this kind of thinking. First, there is simply no reason to assume that every observable behavior is an adaptation, that is, has evolved as a direct result of natural selection. Second, a behavior does not have to provide its current effector higher relative fitness for it to have evolved as a direct result of natural selection in the past. For ex- ample, genetic variation that was once correlat- ed with differential fitness may now be exhaust- ed, such that variation in fitness among individ- uals will not be detected. Another possibility is that the environment in which a particular be- havior was once adaptive may no longer exist, with the behavior simply persisting in the cur- rent population. In general, this less than criti- cal treatment of a central topic in biology is not in keeping with an otherwise rigorous treat- ment of the scientific literature. A third overall comment is that, throughout the book, entertaining comparisons are made between fish and human behavior. I did not find this anthropomorphism troublesome; com- parisons are clearly acknowledged as meta- phors, or simply presented as stimulating after- thoughts. Moreover, the author's stated purpose is to popularize the results of scientific research. Therefore, I found it curious that a strongly worded admonition to avoid anthropomorphiz- ing appears at the end of the chapter on mate choice (p. 166-167). After reading nearly an en- tire book peppered with lively and relatively in- offensive anthropomorphisms, I found the ad- monition awkwardly placed, and somewhat less than credible. A final, minor criticism is that the author</page><page sequence="3">538 COPEIA, 2002, NO. 2 commonly presents contrived data to illustrate a particular point. Although this may serve as an educational tool to the nonscientist, it is somewhat annoying for one accustomed to in- terpreting graphs and figures. More than once, I found myself poring over a set of data only to discover the data were not real. Despite these criticisms, I found the book thoroughly enjoyable and highly educational. I imagine it will appeal to both aquarists and ac- ademicians and to anyone else captivated by the behavior of our aquatic relatives. Reebs does an excellent job of describing the academic re- search that has generated our current knowl- edge and does so with an infectious sense of wonder at the remarkable behavior of fishes.
