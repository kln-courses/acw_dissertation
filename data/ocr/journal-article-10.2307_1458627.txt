<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF BIBLE AND RELIGION VOLUME XI AUGUST - 1943 PART 3 The Christian Faith and the Faith of the Future* J. HOWARD HOWSON CHRISTIANITY IS a historical religion. It reaches back nineteen hundred years as a distinctive religion. It has permeated the cultural life of many different peoples. It has been the religion of some sixty genera- tions of Christians. Each of these peoples, each of these generations, has seen it in the light of its own peculiar problems and its own distinctive world-outlook. Furthermore, the Christian faith at any given age, in any given country, has its own levels of com- plexity. There is the faith which may be expressed in a series of dogmas. Behind these dogmas are the values of which the dogmas are the current conceptualization. Behind the values are the elemental attitudes of life-affirmation or life-denial. A consideration of the Christian faith can appropriately begin with the faith of Jesus; but the faith of Jesus was not distinctively Christian. Jesus was a Jew. His faith was murtured in Judaism. What is that faith? Here again we encounter the complexity that we have ascribed to the Christian faith. It is easy to over-simplify. We must cau- tion against any analysis as being exhaustive. However, there were certain great convic- tions, certain great affirmations, that charac- terized the Jewish faith. To the Jew at the time of Jesus the created universe was the expression of God. And God was righteous to the point of holiness. Thus there was no fundamental dualism between the world and God, or between man as such and God, for man was created in the image of God. The universe was inherently moral as the expression of a holy God. To be sure, the devil had introduced into the world the chaotic element of a perverse will, and the contemporary course of world events was under the devil's power. Nevertheless, good would triumph because goodness was, by definition, conformity to the will of Almighty God, who would ultimately prevail over the devil. The triumph would be no abstract ethereal victory, but a concrete and material triumph on an earth released from the prin- ciple of evil, with all its chain of devastat - ing effects on the order of creation. This triumph would not come about through the initiative of man. God would send His messenger in due season to bring it about. In contrast to the prophetic strain in earlier Judaism, the apocalypticism of the period was lacking in faith in the capacity of the Jewish people to alter their destiny. The individual man could but be obedient to the revealed will of God in the Torah and pray hopefully for the future. There was no way by which he could guarantee the collective destiny of Israel or his own per- sonal destiny. Salvation was the gift of God to those whom, in the impenetrable privacy of His infinite wisdom, He found faithful and deserving. Jesus inherited this faith. It formed the background of his distinctive teaching. There is no evidence that he rejected the idea of a unique relationship between Israel and God which was such a fundamental tenet of Judaism. On the other hand, the evidence that he stressed the idea is not too 139</page><page sequence="2">140 J. HOWARD HOWSON [August cogent if one accepts the general principles of Form Criticism. To the writer, the dis- tinctive element in Jesus' faith was his faith in man. Throughout the Synoptics people stand before Jesus as personalities. Whether it be men or women, children or adults, Jews or Gentiles, Publicans or Pharisees, Jesus approaches them as persons. Sex, age, religion, race, class, are all secondary to his primary concern for the quality of their motivation. This concern is no merely professional concern. It is the interest of a person with a profound self-respect, search- ing them, as he searches himself, with keen moral discrimination. Because of this in- herent faith in people, his conception of God, which outwardly was the same as that of the current Judaism, is given a quality of tender understanding that humanizes the apartness involved in holiness. The question has been raised whether a person professing an authoritarian religion can be a free personality. Jesus' religion was most assuredly authoritarian. Yet never was there a freer person than Jesus. His initiative was preserved in the discrimina- tion he made between the greater and lesser demands of the Torah. His soul was free because he was convinced that God had willed His laws for the benefit of mankind; and in this conviction he had a living prin- ciple by which he escaped the shackles of pedantic legalism. Jesus bowed before God, not in slavish submission, but in the reverent affirmation of his whole nature to God's service. The disciples felt this outgoingness of Jesus. They felt the majestic quality of a soul released. They did not incorporate it in their theology, but it was transmitted to their fellowship. Paul caught it and con- ceptualized it, making it the very heart of Christianity. The spirit of Jesus was synonymous with personal triumph and re- lease. And any one could possess this spirit. "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus." No nation, no class, no group, was large enough to encompass and confine the freeing spirit of Jesus. A consulting psychologist has recently de- fined genuine faith as "experiencing life with one's whole self as worth living." Such was Jesus' faith. His experience was neither halting nor half-hearted. He was complete- ly open to the life around him-the sowing of seed, the growth of vegetation, the blos- soming of flowers, the signs of the weather, the homely routines of domestic life, the interplay of personalities, the self-revealing actions of people. Furthermore, his life was one of spontaneity and freedom, at- tributes which a well-known psychiatrist has described as characteristic of faith at its best. Jesus did not have to dramatize his mission as John the Baptist did in playing the role of an ancient prophet; nor did he conform to the current demands of orthodox piety. He moved among men with unconventional free- dom and simplicity. Historical Christianity has obscured this faith. Due to a variety of causes, world denial came to be regarded as a necessary condition for salvation and future happiness. It found expression in different forms-in asceticism of different kinds, in monasticism, in withdrawal from political responsibility. However, we may affirm that Jesus' charac- teristic faith will be an integral component of the faith of the future. Wherever men have studied with open-hearted sincerity the records of this incomparable life they have been lifted to a new appreciation of their own capacities. The early Christians at Jerusalem ex- pressed their faith in Jesus in the context of their apocalyptic hopes. They believed that he had been exalted to God's right hand in heaven, whence he would come as the Messiah to bring in the Kingdom of God. This was the manifest content of their faith. In the form in which they held it we can no longer accept it. Jesus did not come back. In the light of the his- torical criticism of the genesis of the belief</page><page sequence="3">1943] THE FAITH OF THE FUTURE 141 itself, and in the light of our own cosmology today, it is not being unduly dogmatic to assert that he will never come back. This aspect of Christian faith is not for the future. Paul made Jesus' resurrection from the dead the cornerstone of his theological ex- position; and until recently it has been an indispensable element of the Christian faith. Biblical criticism has shown that the Gospel accounts of the resurrection leave much to be desired as reliable historical records and many modern philosophies reject the occur- rence as impossible. To what extent the faith of the future will accept this and how interpret it we can not predict. To some, at least, it will always stand as the symbol of the imperishable quality of Jesus' life, available from age to age to those who genuinely cultivate his spirit. From the beginning of Christianity the new triumphant life in Jesus was expressed in a quality of fellowship within the Chris- tian circle that transcended the ordinary level of human fellowship such as the Chris- tians had experienced in other relationships. This was not true of all Christian groups, or of any Christian group all the time; but there was a Christian quality of life that captured the allegiance of converts and aroused the wonder of those outside. It was expressed freely at first in a joyful breaking of bread together and in the shar- ing of possessions. As the breathless ex- pectancy of the first generation of Chris- tians waned in the second and third genera- tions, there was less of sharing and more of ritualistic expression in their common meals. But with Paul's triumph over the conservatives, Christianity became a brother- hood transcending all national frontiers and all nationalisms. Within the brotherhood there was security for those of the lowliest station; and the encompassing arm of the brotherhood embraced both rich and poor alike. Even though there was no over- arching organization, the churches of Chris- tendom corresponded with each other, and traveling preachers went from church to church. There was a real catholicity of spirit long before it was expressed in in- stitutional forms. Unfortunately, Christianity inherited from Judaism the sense of an exclusive relation to God, so that, increasingly, the Christian fellowship regarded itself as the exclusive vehicle of God's salvation to mankind. As the fellowship crystallized in the church this concept became an integral part of the church's belief: extra ecclesiam nulla salus. We have inherited that belief. To a greater or less degree, we regard ourselves in the Hebrew-Christian tradition as the unique inheritors of God's salvation. Christianity is the absolute or final religion. There is truth in other religions; but it is completed in Christianity. It is doubtful if the faith of the future will sustain this. Historical scholarship shows that other peoples have the same attitude towards their religion that we have towards ours. An attitude of ex- clusiveness, therefore, is an evidence rather of provincialism than of superiority. If we are to approach other peoples with an atti- tude of respect we must respect their religi- ous insights, their religious literature, their religious fellowship. Furthermore, we need to realize that even Christianity is not suf- ficient to contain the spirit of Jesus. The Christianity of today, with its centuries long accumulation of theological speculation, is no more fit to confine the spirit of Jesus than was the Judaism of the time of Paul. We may expect, therefore, that the faith of the future will not be a faith that limits world fellowship but one that extends fel- lowship through mutual understanding and appreciation. One of the most tragic ironies of our contemporary religious situation is that the Lord's Supper which, according to Paul, is the expression of our solidarity in the pos- session of the spirit of Jesus, should be the point at which religious divisions are most acute. We can get an approximation of unity on some external activities, but in one</page><page sequence="4">142 J. HOWARD HOWSON [August of the central affirmations of our faith, spiritual exclusiveness denies the reality of what is symbolized. The Christian community was early faced with the necessity of protecting itself against an interpretation of Christianity that would have deprived it of its historical content. The answer to this was the Roman symbol which we know as the Apostles' Creed. It rejected in no uncertain terms the dualism between the God of Christ and the world of creation. Christianity affirms that, no mat- ter how much man and the world have fallen away from their original state, they are of God and bear the stamp of God upon them. This faith is being challenged from two different quarters today. It is challenged by those religious thinkers who reject natural theology in their effort to protect the wholly-other character of God. It is challenged also by those who regard man as the chance product of the interplay of purely mechanical forces. We may expect the faith of the future to reject both these views. If God be wholly-other, He can be brought into relation to the world and man only by theological legerdemain. If man be a product of natural forces then the study of man himself must be an indispens- able element of the study of Nature. Not a reduced estimate of man, but an in- creased respect for the complexity of the forces that have given him birth is neces- sary. We may expect this Christian faith in the world and man as the creation of God to be an integral part of the faith of the future, not in the sense of a naive anthropomorphic fashioning, to be sure, but in the sense of the continuity between God, as the ultimate ground of existence, and man, as a creature. Quite apart from membership in any cult, or participation in any rite, all men are children of God. Augustine's interpretation of Christianity and his basic faith were tremendously in- fluential in the development of Christianity. When we remember that Protestantism was an outgrowth of Augustinianism and that the Roman Catholic conception of the re- lationship of church and state owes much to Augustine, we begin to realize the magni- tude of his influence. Now Augustine had strong beliefs and disbeliefs that have been incorporated in Christian convictions. In the first place, he was a scholar with faith in reason. If what the Bible appeared to say was contrary to reason then there had to be another interpretation of the passage than that which immediately commended itself to the mind. He did not reject his reason in the maintenance of his faith. His faith was reasonable, even though, in a sense, it was above reason. This faith in reason was characteristic of Scholasticism as it appeared in Medieval Roman Catholicism and is evident also in the New England Puritan theology. The whole world is a rationally consistent struc- ture, in which logical categories attest the orderliness of the Divine mind. That faith came over into Deism and has been charac- teristic of the natural sciences in a modified form. In the natural sciences, proof of a fact has rested primarily on the reliability of observation rather than on its deduction from a logical scheme; and, at the present time, incontrovertibly attested facts are con- stantly upsetting the categories of explana- tion. But we need to remember that the sciences have often built up rigid pictures of the world on the basis of their particular approach, and have yielded to the com- pulsions of facts that have imperiled their logical superstructure only after long and bitter fighting. Many thinkers still believe in the possibility of reducing all the mani- fold phenomena of life to a consistent logical system. Augustine's attempt at system building broke down at the point of sin. His own experience of sin was too vivid to permit him to regard it as merely an imperfect form of good or the absence of good. He knew it as a perversion of the will, for which</page><page sequence="5">1943] THE FAITH OF THE FUTURE 143 there was no rational explanation. In fact, its very irrationality was the mark of its diabolical quality. Yet his own Neo-Platonic background would not allow him to believe in sin as an autonomous principle eternally existent. His solution was a verbal com- promise, in which he had God permitting sin although not the author of it. The writer is of the opinion that all at- tempts to reduce the phenomena of life to a single logically consistent system are fore- doomed to failure. For this reason, ration- ality, i. e. the placing of an item in a logical system of relationships, can never be the ultimate test of reality, nor can the inability so to place an item be the final ground for its rejection as unreal or false. The ulti- mate test for a fact must be the character of the evidence. Rationality must always be subordinate to experienced facts. Theology is the rationalism of religion. To the degree, therefore, that theology pre- sents a beautifully consistent and complete picture of the spiritual life of man in rela- tion to the cosmos, himself, and his fellow- men, just to that degree may it be regarded with suspicion. The ultimate answer to life is not the intellectual elaboration of theo- logical concepts, important as they are, but rather the organization of life in which the balance of good over evil is maintained in action. The faith of the future, therefore, will be primarily concerned with the response of the whole man to life rather than with the conformity of his beliefs to a particular theology. In the second place, Augustine had a pro- found distrust of man's capacity to organize his own impulses so as to achieve salvation. Salvation was possible only through the grace of God mediated through the sacra- ments of the church. This raises two ques- tions for the faith of the future. The first is the capacity of man to organize his own experience. The second is the nature and place of grace and the whole sacramental life. Modern psychotherapy would recognize that one cannot organize one's discordant nature by an act of the will. One must understand the reasons for the discord and be willing to yield oneself to experiences that will gradually heal the spiritual disloca- tion. Healing comes from a quality in the larger life, of which we are a part rather than from a particular act of will. Hence there is a givenness in the healing that is not of ourselves. This is grace. It is an inflow of spiritual power that occurs when we give up our ego-centricity and yield our- selves to a larger life. It comes in various experiences and under varying circum- stances. It is not the monopoly of any religion, any culture, or any age. And, wherever it is experienced, the act in which it occurs becomes a sacrament. The great mistake of organized Chris- tianity has been to subordinate the sacra- ments to ecclesiasticism. The mystics felt this, and Luther expressed it in his doc- trine of vocation, when he realized the possi- bility of cobbling to the glory of God. To the transformed person, all life becomes a sacrament as spiritual power flows in to his receptive soul, which has been opened to the spiritual life of the cosmos and to the spirit- ual life of his fellowmen. The faith of the future will be far more sacramental than at present. This does not mean that the church will cease to mediate grace. On the con- trary. As the church subordinates its ec- clesiasticism to the sacramental, it will be more humbly, but more completely, sacra- mental in its ministry. Another of Luther's contributions to the faith of the future was his realization that man is not saved by slavish submission to a multitude of duties. Man is saved only through justification, to use Luther's term. We may state it in psychological terms by saying that man is saved only by a re- orientation to life, so that he yields to the healing experiences, rather than by filling his personality with a tangle of conflicting tensions. This is a re-emphasis in slightly</page><page sequence="6">144 J. HOWARD HOWSON [August different form of Augustine's position that salvation can not come from one's own striv- ing. Grace is as necessary for spiritual liv- ing today as it was in the days when salva- tion came only through the church. The faith of the future will be a con- tinuation of those deepest faiths of Chris- tianity that have persisted from age to age. It is the affirmation of a life that has been enriched by the experiences of countless souls who have been nurtured in the Chris- tian tradition. It is the affirmation of life that is also to be found in the religious geniuses of other religions and cultures. Christianity has no monopoly of this faith. In fact, it needs a living contact with other peoples to overcome the provincialisms that overlie and obscure the universality of its faith. This faith it expresses in various theologies. These theologies involve differ- ent cosmologies and different epistemologies; but they are not the essence of the Christian faith. The Christian faith which we may expect to live on is a faith in a value-sup- porting cosmic order, of which each of us is a partial expression. As we open ourselves to the full nature of this life that flows through us all, we receive a strength that comes as from without, and we are caught up in a quality of fellowship we had not dreamed possible. This fellowship is both cosmic and social. On the cosmic side it is expressed in worship, prayer and sacra- mental living. On the social side it is ex- pressed in a quality of living with one's fellowmen that combines a sense of the whole human family with a feeling for that upreach of spirit that is to be found in even the humblest human being.</page></plain_text>
