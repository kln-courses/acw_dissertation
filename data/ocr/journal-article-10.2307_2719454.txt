What the narrator tells us Kaoru thinks to himself here is literally "the five something-or-other, " "the five-what-you-may-call-its. " In Sairyu`- sho- OMENJ, his commentary on Genji, Sanjonishi Sanetaka l (1455-1537) lauded this circumlocution: "Not saying 'sawari' but writing 'nanigashi' evokes nuance in a manner that is beyond com- pare" (sawari to iwazu shite nanigashi to kakeru, yosei taguinashi).2 But what are these powerfully evoked overtones? And whose subtlety is being praised? Presumably, the author's, that is, Murasaki Shiki- bu's. Tamagami Takuya LE J _F9, doyen of twentieth-century Genji annotators, attributed the circumlocution to a desire to avoid use of the equivalent Chinese word "gosho`" 1E, but, like Sanetaka, he did not specify whether he understood that desire to have been felt by the Genji narrator (katarite i+) or author (sakusha f1X), or whether the discrimination between Chinese and Japanese termi- nology was to be understood as one originating in Kaoru's own mind.3 We may follow both Sanetaka and Tamagami in seeking an expla- nation for this circumlocution somewhere within the complexities of the monogatari's narrative dynamics, but we can also come up with some other suggestions. The eleventh-century hearer or reader of the words " itsutsu no nanigashi " can be expected to have had no trou- ble solving the riddle: itsutsu no nanigashi = itsutsu no sawari, orgosho, the obstruction (or preclusion) of women from five forms of re- birth-as a Brahma god king, or as Sakra, or Mara, or as a Wheel- turning King, or (most importantly) as a Buddha-which, as it is argued in several Buddhist scriptures, most prominently the Lotus Sutra, women may not achieve simply because and as long as they are women. But why should the hearer or reader be drawn into this little guessing game? Perhaps in order to learn how to "read" Kaoru. If we are following Kaoru's thoughts about his mother's con- dition (through what is called, in traditional Genji narratology, shin- naigo CA'-Ptext that replicates that which takes shape as the lan- guage of private, unspoken thought within the mind of a character), 2 Akiyama et al., loc. cit., note 10. 3 Tamagami Takuya, Genji monogatari hyoshaku (Kadokawa shoten, 1964-68) 9.219.</page><page sequence="3">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 391 we may be following him right up to that point where his under- standing of a woman's concerns, as she might express them to her- self, becomes a little foggy. It is apparent from the rest of the pas- sage that Kaoru cannot really put himself in his mother's place, with much sympathy. Perhaps the detour from the explicit language of itsutsu no sawari represents his reluctance, or inability, to think as she does, in the words she might use in forming her own thoughts. Or perhaps we should take a clue from the fact that the language of the clause immediately preceding the circumlocution-the clause about the transformation of the dew upon the lotus into jewels (hachisu no tsuyu mo akiraka ni tama to migakitamawamu koto mo katashi) -resonates through its gesture to the language of a familiar poem, namely, Archbishop Henjo's {fiOLE , on "seeing dew on a lotus (hachisu no tsuyu o miteyomeru)" in Kokin wakashiu (Summer, no. 165): hachisuba no nigori ni shimanu kokoro mote nani ka wa tsuyu o tama to azamuku4 Why is it that the lotus leaves, their hearts determined to be free of taint, still deceive us with dewdrops that look like jewels? 4 Saeki Umetomo WtMOA, ed., Kokin wakashui, NKBT8.134. In Arthur Waley's transla- tion of Genji the allusion to Henjo's poem (not identified as such in Seidensticker's) is marked with single quotation marks but with no identification of the source, while the significant in- direction of "itsutsu no nanigashi" is at least partly suggested in the clause, "Vaguely too there came into his mind something about 'the five drawbacks.' " (See Waley, trans., The Tale of Genji. [New York: The Modern Library, 1960], p. 752.) Both Waley and Seidensticker sup- ply a note to the reader to explain what the five "hindrances" or "drawbacks" are. "Hin- drance'". is obviously a better translation of sawari, as it functions here, than is "drawback." I prefer the translation "obstruction" to the most commonly seen "obstacle," since itsutsu no sawari basically refers to a state or condition of preclusion from the five forms of rebirth rather than to an impeding object or entity per se. (Something like "the five-fold obstructed- ness" or "the five-fold impedimentation" might be still more accurate, if such words existed.) The cause of the five-fold obstruction is simply the fact that women are women. However, itsutsu no sawari are often treated (in waka and elsewhere ) as something internal to women (e.g., they are equated with bonno M, mental or spiritual handicaps) or as something they bring upon themselves (e.g., tsumi W, the commission of a transgression and/or its handcapping consequences, zaisho 9I) rather than as a state attributable to them simply by virtue of the fact that they are born as women. Examples of this somewhat different treatment are dis- cussed below, and this shift in the use and understanding of the term and concept is discussed in detail by Yoshida Kazuhiko iE-I in his essay "Ryiinyo no j6butsu" in Osumi Kazuo ktfhm and Nishiguchi Junko ^ ilj:, eds., Shfrfzu: Josei to Bukkyo 2: Sukui to oshie (Heibonsha, 1989), pp. 45-91; see especially pp. 65-68.</page><page sequence="4">392 EDWARD KAMENS Henjo's poem resonates, in turn, with the language and imagery of the Lotus Sutra itself, specifically, an oft-quoted passage in the "Juijiyujutsu bon" *i fip, the "Welling Up Out of Earth" chap- ter: kono moromoro no busshi ra wa, sono kazu, hakarubekarazu. hisashiku sude ni butsudo o gyojite jinzui chiriki ni 6seri. yoku bosatsud6 o manabite, seken no h6 ni somazaru koto, renge no mizu ni aru ga gotoshi, chi yori yujutsu shite ...

They have well learned the bodhisattva-path, and/they are un- tainted by worldly dharmas, Like the lotus bossom in the water./Out of earth welling up . . . This charting of the process that yields the language that represents Kaoru's thought-the indication of its interaction with Henjo's poem, which likewise forms itself through allusion to the sutra pas- sage-follows traditional Genji and Kokinshui commentary. What such traditional commentary can tell us is that the language of the texts toward which these allusive gestures are made was or seems to have been alive in the creative consciousness of the maker of the new text: as a result, both "old" and "new" text communicate with their hearers or readers in particularly complex (intertextual) ways. Elaborating on the implications of traditional annotation, then, we can think of both clauses in this section of Kaoru's "thought" as 5 Takakusu Junjiro A4Mk:,3, Watanabe Kaigyoku iIAO) I, and Ono Genmy6 iJ1'f A#, eds., Taishoshinshi daizokyj [hereafter TJ . 85 vols.

Specifically, these are associations that cluster around the language and ideas of the Lotus Sutra as received and appropriated for various purposes and contexts by lay men and women in Heian times. In a manner parallel to that which reproduces and rearranges the words of Henjo's poem into the words that form here as (the representation of) Kaoru's thoughts, so too the words itsutsu no nanigashi may be a partial reproduction of the words of a poem or poems (or some other form of discourse) that Kaoru may be imagined to have heard or otherwise encountered. (The poems may or may not have existed; they may simply be part of the Genji fiction, which parallels but is not necessarily the same thing as historical fact.) In their meander- ings, Kaoru's musings about his mother's religious life (or, the representations of them in the text) venture into a mode of discourse that is shaped by the language of waka in that portion of its range where it intersects and mixes with the language of Buddhist litera- ture, specifically the Lotus. The reproduction at this moment in the Genji narrative of trans- muted echoes of what seems to be language that Kaoru may plausi- bly have seen or heard elsewhere (in his fictional world) is perhaps most telling about Kaoru, a character we, as readers, are just get- ting to know as we read this passage. We learn here that, even more than his supposed father Genji, Kaoru feels a strong affinity for ways of seeing himself and his world through lenses colored by Bud- dhist thought and imagery. He will feel a similar desire to renounce the world, though, like Genji and most other characters in the fic- tion, he will never fully do so. His greatest absorption will turn out to be in himself, though at this point he does seem to have some genuine concern about his mother, and thinks he wants to help. But he also condescends, and dismisses her. Of course, dismissal, condescension, and exclusion-of women, by men-are what the itsutsu no sawari topos is all about. Its origins lie in ancient Indian attitudes and practices transmitted along with Buddhism, through texts, to China and Japan. Early Indian Bud- dhist clerical communities inherited many of the wider society's in- stitutional misogynies: a culturally nurtured repulsion from certain</page><page sequence="6">394 EDWARD KAMENS aspects of female physiology, especially the menses, led to the de- cree that women were unfit to be "vessels of the Dharma" and that contact with them was a source of pollution. Such anti-female rhetoric supported the institutionalization and maintenance of celi- bacy in Buddhist monasteries: the idea of "the five obstructions" is just one particular form of it. Discussions of "the five obstruc- tions" (Sanskrit panca avaranarni) per se occur not only in "Deva- datta," the twelfth chapter of the Lotus Sutra (and a late [i.e., early sixth century] appendage to the Kumarajiva translation, Myjho renge kyo NAMf, T no. 262), which is the most important textual siting for Japanese Buddhism-especially for laypersons-but also in a number of other texts, including Chu-agongyo @R1M, Ziichi agongyo JOH 9, Gobun ritsu iE5YH, and in Chonichimyozanmaikyo 9 Fl . In the latter (T no. 638, a sutra originally translated by Dharmaraksa and revised by Nie Cheng Yuan i*&amp; in the late third century), the various reasons why women cannnot attain five "levels" of existence (go kaii, Eft, Sanskrit panca-sthana) are ex- plained in detail: it is argued, for instance, that they cannot attain Buddhahood because they do not cultivate the compassionate and self-sacrificing practices of Bodhisattvas, and are lacking in the re- quisite insight into the true nature of Dharmas, but are, on the contrary, sensuous, lusty, and deceitful.6 The emphasis on female sensuality is perhaps the most revealing element of such argumen- tation: it indicates that the imposition of such ideas as the "five ob- structions" is based on the idea that women are a threat to men be- cause they may cause men to stray from their purposes. In other words, women are themselves seen as obstacles in men's paths; in turn, men, writing scriptures and making rules for their religious in- stitutions, describe and emplace barriers for women. The idea of "the five obstructions" is one rhetorical manifestation of this com- plex of attitudes; it is a metaphor for a much wider range of negative (as well as more positive) views and treatments of women by men, woven into the fabric of Buddhist culture.7 6 T 15.541b-c.

For a detailed study, see Diana</page><page sequence="7">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 395 Though distanced culturally and historically from these origins, the passing gesture to the idea of "the five obstructions" that is made amid Kaoru's musings, embedded in the narrative fabric of Genji, is not only evidence of the status of that idea in secular Japanese thought (ca. 1000 C.E.): it also succinctly reveals Kaoru's own ambivalent and deeply troubled feelings toward women, his mother included. The author of the fiction, depicting a fictional male character's mind, uses it to say a great deal about him-and perhaps about other men as well. So, as Sanetaka observed, the subtle ramifications of this bit of sig- nificantly indirect language are worth special consideration. The in- direction itself causes us to pause and consider its meaning. At this moment in the monogatari, a text written by a woman to be shared with other women, Kaoru is being portrayed as a man whose assess- ment of the efficacy of his own mother's religious activity is aptly shaped by language that every listening or reading woman would recognize as emblematic of her own uneasy negotiations for a place in a world framed in large part by Buddhist language and thought. But, to such hearers or readers, a transmuted itsutsu no nanigashi in Kaoru's mind said even more than a straightforward itsutsu no sawari might. Cast this way, the words reminded them that the idea of the five obstructions was of man's, not woman's, making, and thus still subject (as were they) to male manipulation. The words itsutsu no sawari, in various guises, were there to be used, by both women and men, as emblems of the inferior place in the Buddhist world that men had imposed on women. And as long as that imposi- tion was manifest in action, institutions, or thought, and even when its full force was moderated by more egalitarian teachings, prac- tices, and beliefs, those words would remain entrenched within Paul, Women in Buddhism: Images of the Feminine in the Mahdydna Tradition. (Second Edition. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985.) The institutionalized misogyny of early In- dian Buddhist communities is also manifest in the frequently argued idea that the historical Buddha's acceptance of a female clergy within the Buddhist monastic community caused the "age of the true Dharma" (shoho it,) to be shortened by several hundred years. Minamoto Tamenori's , Sanboe _I;WV (984) contains what is perhaps the earliestJapanese version of the story of the first Buddhist nun, with an exposition of this theory: see Kamens, The Three Jewels: A Translation and Study of Minamoto Tamenori's Sanboe.

In Hosshin wakashuz AJ1W k, a devotional waka discourse by a woman, Daisaiin Senshi t*MXT , composed (in 1012, not long af- ter the writing of Genji came to an end) primarily to be read by and shared with other women (not unlike Genji), the words "itsutsu no sawari" and all they represent easily make their way to the fore- ground. They do so almost immediately, in the second poem in the fifty-five poem sequence, which takes as its topic the second of the Shiguzeigan (B14ffi,, the "Four Vast [Bodhisattva] Vows"), which is bonno mube zeigandan MMWZ Mif: "Afflictions [obstacles to en- lightenment] are numberless: I vow to eliminate them all." kazoubeki kata mo nakeredo mi ni chikaki mazu wa itsutsu no sawari narikeri8 There is no way to count them all, but those that are closest to me are certainly those Five Ob- structions. The term bonno (in the text of the vow) can be broadly construed as "(forms of) ignorance/illusion," and in Senshi's poem these are ac- knowledged to be numberless (kazoubeki kata mo nakeredo): but the ones that are of the greatest concern to the poem-speaker (mi ni chikaki, "most relevant to my (physical) self") are the "five obstruc- tions." By identifying itsutsu no sawari with and as primary (mazu wa . . .) among the bonno that afflict her, Senshi expresses the view that the "the five obstructions" are first and foremost among the factors that obstruct her spiritual progress. She may do so in light of a traditional equation of bonno (particularly, those that plague women) with gosho, and so we might view this as an internalization of the gosho handicap: it is no longer, nor simply, the manifestation of a view of women imposed by males in the form of a figural barrier to women, but, almost literally, an incorporation of that view into the female self-image and, particularly, into the image of the female 8 Shinpen kokka taikan Henshfi Iinkai, ed., Shinpen kokka taikan [hereafter SKT] (Kadokawa shoten, 1983-) 3.292.</page><page sequence="9">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 397 body ([onna no] mi). But this may also be Senshi's way of saying that concern about the very idea that five obstructions exist is itself an im- pediment to spiritual improvement: consciousness of it creates anxi- ety and may diminish a woman's capacity to focus her full attention and faith on other messages. Or, perhaps, consciousness of it modi- fies and reshapes her understanding of other messages, as it does in Senshi's interpretation of the first "Vast Vow," shujo muben zeigando *?i*109mt, "Sentient beings are numberless: I vow to save them all'': tare to naku hitotsu ni nori no ikada nite kanata no kishi ni tsuku yoshimogana9 How I wish there were a way for all to ride together, without distinctions, the Dharma a raft that carries us to the opposite shore! In the light of the second poem, this first poem in the sequence, a plea for inclusiveness, allowing "all . . . without distinction" to ride "together" on the Dharma raft (nori no ikada), may refer specifi- cally to the hope that women (in particular) shall not be excluded. The poet's response to the all-embracing spirit of the vow text is to ask, with some anxiety, "Will I-and, for that matter, will other women-be among those who will be saved?" The concern, that she and they may not, comes from the inescapable consciousness that the idea of the five obstructions is a doctrine of exclusion, di- rectly at odds with the spirit of the Bodhisattva's vow of universal compassion. Hosshin wakashui can be said to stand at or near the origin of a long tradition of devotional verse forming within the larger tradition of waka as a whole. 10 A search through the waka canon for other poems that address the five obstructions topos, in sequences, cycles, and 9 Ibid. 10 Ruidai homon wakashui chzikai ff I4&lt;;8J JE&amp;, compiled by Hatanaka Morio I1'tg , a Sendai scholar of national learning, and first published in 1790, is a useful if uncritical compendium of waka composed on topics and themes taken from Buddhist scriptures which amply documents the scale of this tradition. As the title suggests, the poems are classified topi- cally (ruidai, much as in Kokin waka rokujo It+fQ0Z or Wakan roeishu lftJrMU ), so one can easily compare poems composed by various poets, of various periods, on the same textual topics. See Tsukada K6shin t*MAfg ed., Ruidai homon wakashui chtikai. 4 vols. Koten bunko 471, 473, 479, 481. (Koten bunko, 1985-87).</page><page sequence="10">398 EDWARD KAMENS collections composed and compiled under a variety of conditions, yields an impression of the remarkable tenacity and malleability of that topos. Having found a place in waka's topical repertoire (through such exercises as Senshi's, among others), the topos (like so many other topoi, of many kinds) becomes a textual site to which poets-both women and men-will turn, as occasion, sentiment, or formal exigencies may prompt or demand. In the process, the topos acquires a functional vitality of its own, and is active in a dimension other than that in which the doctrinal notion of the five obstructions holds sway. In other words, the topos becomes poetic. And, while the topos of "the five obstructions" will always be treated in waka contexts that can be described as having some relationship to the religious experience of women, the manner in which this "religious" topos is treated in verse tends to secularize the topos and thus to render it viable, over the long term, as an element of waka discourse, even when the original religious idea in which its origins lay had been effectively muted, refuted, or displaced by more appealing and potent teachings." In this process, the range of meanings generated by poems that address the "five obstructions" topos expands. But, while incorporation of the topos into the broad- er waka inventory yields additional and altered patterns of significa- tion, it cannot efface the topos's original purport: in poetry, as in Buddhist discourse, it refers to the act of setting women radically apart from men and portrays them as possessors of special hand- icaps that can only be overcome if they can manage to become men. As we shall see, that essential change is the focus of nearly ev- ery itsutsu no sawari poem: "five obstructions" poesy is fundamental- ly a poesy of transforimation from sex to sex (and on to sexlessness)-from a state viewed as inferior to a state of superior and permanent perfec- tion. And the development of this poesy is itself a story of a transfor- mation from an idea embedded in Buddhist texts to a conventional- ized element of waka language. " Taira Masayuki's 1T*ff essay, "Chuisei Bukky6 to josei" in Joseishi s6go kenkyuikai, ed., Nihon josei seikatsu shi 2: Chuisei (Tokyo Daigaku shuppankai, 1990, pp. 75-108) is one of several studies that show how various religious figures refuted or deflected attention from the "five obstructions" and other notions of women's handicaps by focusing on other texts, such as Amida's thirty-fifth vow, which guarantees rebirth in the Pure Land to all women (after a prerequisite change of sex). See also Yoshida, "Ryuinyo no j6butsu," pp. 69-73.</page><page sequence="11">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 399 Investigation of the poetic transformation of the five obstructions topos illustrates the interaction, within the perimeters of a literary tradition such as that of waka, of religious and secular ideas, topoi, and tropes: crossovers (of images, rhetoric, form) blur such catego- ries, and create new possibilities for the manipulation of ideas in lan- guage. As I have suggested elsewhere, many poems that are usually treated in the waka tradition as Shakkyoka ft-, "Buddhist poet- ry," a sub-genre or category within the larger canon, share with secular verse certain elements of diction, figures, rhetorical pat- terns, conventions for treating certain topics and other formal fea- tures. The contours of these categories, secular and religious, must therefore be called into question.12 In examining those contours, one must cast a wide net: it simply is not enough to look at the "Bud- dhist poems" in the Imperial anthologies alone, as many scholars do.'3 The chokusenshuz are selective and exclusive, and the selections and exclusions were made by men ex postfacto, operating under vari- ous agendas. A wider search through the waka canon (which in- cludes hundreds of thousands of poems but which represents only what survives from various preservation processes, some of which were themselves selective and exclusive) yields a more accurate pic- ture of the ranges of ways in which poem-making takes place-and, among other things, is more likely to reveal the fruits of women's participation in the development of the waka tradition. The results of this search do not yield large numbers of poems about "the five obstructions," nor evidence of a topos that can be said to dominate, or demand disproportional attention, in any given sector of the canon, even in what may be collectively catego- rized as women's devotional poetry in general. On the other hand, the topos often does invite and receive some attention whenever women (as well as some men) write waka in devotional (or quasi- devotional) contexts, as shall be seen from examples below. Though it has been and is widely known and much discussed, "the five obstructions" cannot be said to be an idea that figures very large 12 See Kamens, The Buddhist Poetry of the Great Kamo Priestess: Daisaiin Senshi and Hosshin wakashui.

Still, among scores of other compelling and convention- consecrated topoi, and even in the face of ample doctrinal and other kinds of refutation of the idea of "the five obstructions" itself, this topos surfaces viably again and again in waka discourse, and the rea- sons for this invite speculation. For one thing, the five obstructions and requisite gender- transformation idea simply would not go away: they were perennial sticking-points in Buddhist discourse. There was, of course, plenty of rival discourse: early setsuwa (quasi-historical didactic tales) and ojoden (tales of various individuals' achievement of rebirth in Amida's Pure Land) offered ample evidence that women can achieve highly advanced spiritual states and may, under the right conditions, make their way to the Pure Land immediately after their death."4 Such stories set aside "the five obstructions" and de- emphasize the entire gender issue, but elsewhere this was not the case. For example, when pressed for explication of Amida Buddha's thirty-fifth vow, which promises that all women may attain the Pure Land, most medieval commentators (including H6nen &amp;A, [1133- 1212], the defacto founder of the Pure Land [Jodo] school) would maintain that the vow works because Amida first helps the woman to learn to despise her own womanhood and thus to ready herself for the requisite change to maleness which his compassion bestows on her.15 Thus, even within the profoundly universal teachings of Amidism (which holds that even the most evil man can attain the Pure Land, if he relies on Amida), an internal contradiction per- 14 An important study of this literature, which treats it as documentation of the evolution of widespread attitudes about women, is Kasahara Kazuo's ARV-9, Nyonin ojo shiso no keifu (Yoshikawa k6bunkan, 1975.)

Indeed, one of the most important respects in which that eter- nal life is ideal is the very fact that it is not life as a woman. Of course, the problematic persistence of this contradiction alone cannot explain the durability of the "five obstructions" topos in Japanese verse; we must also consider aspects of that poetic tradi- tion itself. It is in the nature of a literary tradition (such as waka) to return again and again to the same topical territories, and to the tropes linked to them. We should ask why this is true of certain tropes and not others. Is it perhaps because particular tropes that are repeatedly called upon to offer themselves as flexible vessels for certain messages themselves contain important messages? When we read waka for those messages-for evidence of what a poem's maker felt and thought (which, though it is not the only way, is the way the tradition itself invites us to read them), we must look carefully not only at the kokoro .t/, the poem's communicated core, but also at its kotoba 2I, the words that are the means through which that com- munication is made. In "Shakkyoka," just as in other waka, kokoro and kotoba are often inextricably linked: the way that a poet says what he or she says is often part of the message, sometimes all of it. In poems that deal in one way or another with the various topoi (es- pecially "the five obstructions") that relate to women's status in Buddhism, the tensions that arise from that status are often to be de- tected in formal tensions that give structure to those poems-struc- ture (kotoba) which is organically linked to meaning (kokoro). I think that it was at least in part because such tensions persisted in Bud- dhist discourse that these topoi of tension also persisted as viable ele- ments in waka discourse thoughout much of its long history. LOCUS CLASSICUS It is but a thread in the rich narrative fabric of the Lotus Sutra, but again and again it has captured special attention: in the "Deva- datta" chapter, Sariputra questions the eight-year-old daughter of the dragon king about her possession of the prerequisites for Buddahood. "A woman's body is filthy," he says; "it is not a</page><page sequence="14">402 EDWARD KAMENS Dharma-receptacle. " Furthermore, women are obstructed from five forms of rebirth: because they are women, they cannot be reborn as a Brahma god king, or as Sakra, or Mara, or as a Wheel-turning King, or as a Buddha. In response, the girl offers the Buddha (Sakyamuni) a precious gem. The Buddha swiftly accepts the jewel. Then the whole assembly watches while, just as swiftly, the girl turns into a man and is enthroned as a buddha in her own "Spot- less" world-sphere.16 Another related thread that stands out in the fabric: in the "Medi- cine King" chapter (Yakuj Bosatsu honji bon *T!;*4 J), the Bud- dha states, "If a woman, hearing this chapter of the former affairs of the Bodhisattva Medicine King, can accept it and keep it, she shall put an end to her female body, and shall never again receive one.)" If she hears it and practices its teachings she shall at death go straight to Amida's Pure Land and "never again be tormented" by "greed, anger or folly, pride, envy, or other defilements" inherent to women.17 The composition of waka poems by both men and women was just one among the many modes of acknowledgment and response to the gravity of such moments in this central text of Japanese Bud- dhism. The frontispieces to these two chapters in many offertory copies of the sutra (among the most ornate of which is the Heike nokyo T*Mff3 version, in the set of sutra copies donated by the Taira fami- ly to the Itsukushima Shrine in 1167) are visual devices through which special attention was focused on these episodes-and the prominence of female figures in these frontispieces reminds us, as well, that women were often the sponsors, users, or manufacturers of such objects.18 Another form of response and appropriation, com- paratively free from the constrictions of waka conventions and representative of a literary voice other than that of the elite, can be seen and heard in imayo +-,: songs 113, 116, 117, 119, 153, 208, and 292 in Ryojin hisho f all directly address either the "Devadatta" Dragon-girl episode or Yakuo Bosatsu's vow."9 16 T 9:35c; Hurvitz, Scripture of the Lotus Blossom, p. 201. 17 T 9.54c; Hurvitz, Scripture of the Lotus Blossom, p. 300. 18 For a detailed study of these frontispieces and related works, see WillaJ.

The prevalence of this tactic over overt argument or rejection is no doubt to be traced to the fact that both kinds of song-these "religious" im- ayo and "devotional" waka-were sung or written to do honor to, rather than to refute, the scriptural texts with which they engage, and to inculcate reverence for them. In waka, from the beginning of the eleventh century, or there- abouts, such acknowledgments, responses, and other forms of tex- tual interaction with and adoration of the Lotus often took the form of sequences of poems which addressed as their topics passages from each of the sutra's twenty-eight chapters in succession.20 In the texts of some such sequences, the passages with which each poem interacts are explicitly inscribed as their topic-identifying prefaces, or kotobagaki 1I4; sometimes, however, we are told (in the kotoba- gaki) that the dai a (topic) is simply "the core meaning" or "central message" (kokoro) of a specific section of the sutra-usually, a whole chapter. The interacting poem is often essentially a rearrangement of the Chinese sutra text into the language of Japanese verse, but in many cases reiteration becomes reinterpretation, personalizing ap- propriation, and occasionally even an inversion of the original pas- sage's intent. Nonetheless, the fundamental purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate devotion to the original and esteemed text by creat- ing a new parallel text that glosses it, celebrates it, and expands upon or sharpens its meaning, as the poet understands it. Daisaiin Senshi's Hosshin wakashu includes one of the earliest such n/ijuhappon no uta ("poems on the twenty-eight chapters") series to survive intact, and her manner of addressing the five obstruc- tions topos as she encountered it in the Lotus "Devadatta" chapter -its most conspicuous setting-is typical in several ways.

The moment celebrated here is not the moment in which the Dragon-girl offers the jewel, nor that in which she instantaneously changes sex and becomes a Buddha: it is the moment after these mo- ments, during which the assembly absorbs the meaning of her achievement and revels in a collective sense of awe for the Dharma's power, which has been so amply demonstrated in her. Senshi's poem shares in this rejoicing; yet, hers is not simply the joy of an ob- server but, rather, the joy of one who takes the girl's achievement as example (tameshi), as a message of hope available to her for her own appropriation. Taking it that way may be a kind of willful misread- ing: neither the prose nor the verse portions of the Dragon-girl's story in the Lotus suggest that it be treated as an example of what any and all women may experience, in similar circumstances; rath- er, the story is offered as yet another piece of evidence, among many, 21 SKT 3.293. 22 Hurvitz, Scripture of the Lotus Blossom, 201; Sakamoto and Iwamoto, Hokekyo 2.224.</page><page sequence="17">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 405 of the Lotus's all-embracing powers, and in support of the sutra's own claims for the magnificence of the single "Great Vehicle, " devo- tion to which has won this girl such great rewards. The prescrip- tions given women and other kinds of beings in the "Medicine- King" chapter constitute a far more inclusive and explicit promise of salvation; still, whether a misreading or not, the Dragon-girl's story was almost always read (in Senshi's time, and later) as a paradigm for all women and, indeed, for all those who are seen as inferiors, all those handicapped in one way or another in their quest for ultimate salvation.23 This, then, is Senshi's understanding of the kokoro of the passage. And with what kind of kotoba is her joy and optimism expressed? The reflexive negation with which the poem begins-sawari ni mo sawaranu, "not obstructed by the obstructions"-is its formal crux, a bit of paradoxical play with positive and negative and nomi- nal and verbal forms of the same word which succinctly replicates the narrative of this section of the sutra itself. First, the obstructions (sawari) are posited, as in Sariputra's argument, and then they are negated (sawaranu): paradoxically, then, what was understood as obstruction has proven to be no obstruction at all. The attention drawn through this means to the notion, language, and imagery of obstruction prepares us, in turn, to read hedatsuru kumo, "the clouds that were there, forming obstructions," as metaphor for particular obstructions-those five which, Senshi says, are nullifed in light of the girl's example (tameshi arikereba . . . kumo mo araji to zo omou). The striking figure-"clouds" for "the five obstructions" -will become ubiquitous in itsutsu no sawari poems. As with all such 23 Prayers of intercession (ganmon IMiZ) composed by men (in Chinese prose) for deceased royal and aristocratic women provide further examples of treatment of the Dragon-girl story as generalizable paradigm. The ganmon written by Yoshishige Yasutane WIVIl on behalf of the Dainagon Fujiwara Tamemitsu #1q4)A for the forty-ninth-day memorial service ob- served in the autumn of 985 in memory of Tamemitsu's daughter Teishi tFTF, a consort of Emperor Kazan, explicitly prays that she may never be reborn as a woman and that even though the "five obstructions" that impede women are as ineradicable as the "five marks of decrepitude" that mar heavenly beings ([tennin no] gosui [IkAOD] Ef)t this dead woman's spirit should nonetheless quickly be led to its place in the Pure Land. Yasutane goes on to say that, although the Dragon-girl experienced her transformation into a Buddha from "this very body" (sokushin OPM), there is hope that Teishi will achieve the same thing even in her present post-mortem incarnation (goshin *).

For one thing, we may see this as a transportation or transla- tion into a devotional context of an image of obstructing clouds which elsewhere (in waka) stand between parted lovers, or between travelers and their homescapes, or the friends at home for whom they yearn or who yearn for them.24 When the five obstructions are figured as clouds, they are analogous barriers to sight or progress which, if dispelled, yield a view not of a loved one's dwelling or a yearned-for home, but of a vision (perhaps not unlike that de- picted in the Heike nokyo "Devadatta" frontispiece) of the religious aspirant's own path to or achievement of ultimate and permanent salvation. But, it would seem, such figuring was not the exclusive property of waka poets-and was not necessarily their invention. We encoun- ter the same figure in the Chinese texts of prayers of intercession (ganmon) for royal women-in Sugawara Atsushige's V19;OR, for Inshi )IL#, the mother of Emperor Daigo, in 925: MAN&amp; AWIRP_11_ KJ *CLAR sh6zuru tokoro no fukue, kotogotoku sanryo ni shiseba, gosho no kumo tsukite hongaku no tsuki ch6mei nari 24 To trace such imagery one might look to Man 'y5shti 17-18 (Princess Nukada asks clouds not to block her view of Mount Miwa as she leaves Nara for Omi), 136 (Hitomaro's steed car- ries him swiftly into cloud banks that rise between him and his wife's residence) and 2460 and 2669 (twin poems in which clouds are begged not to block the moon, so that both members of a parted couple can gaze on it from their respective locations); Kokin wakashIu 367, 378, 379, and 380, all of which are farewells to travelers; Gosen wakashiu 1214 ("Why don't the clouds that part us [a formerly intimate couple] clear?") and 1306 ("Since nothing obstructs my longing thoughts [of you, on your distant travels, says a friend who stays at home], why do these clouds stand between us?"); and Shuii wakashui 311 ([presented with a fan to a departing traveler:] "I wish that with this fan I could send a breeze to blow away the clouds that will stand between me and you"), as well as Ise monogatari dan 23 (the woman in Takayasu asks the clouds not to block her view of Ikomayama, over which her erstwhile lover is fleeing) and the Emperor Reizei's poem in the Hashihime chapter of Genji monogatari (addressed to his younger half-brother, the Eighth Prince and acknowledging the Prince's formal taking of religious vows and withdrawal to a mountain retreat by describing "layers of clouds" that now physi- cally and figuratively separate them.</page><page sequence="19">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 407 If all the blessings that here arise are put to use at her tomb, The clouds of the five obstructions will disappear And the moon of original enlightenment will shine long and bright.25 and in a ganmon for the late wife of Fujiwara Akitada M,, dated 958: gosho wa seichuf no kumo, keifu fukite kotogotoku harai, rokuyoku wa shungo no kori, butsunichi terite hayaku kien The five obstructions are clouds amidst a clear sky: the blessing winds will blow, sweeping them away. The six desires are ice that remains though spring has come: the Buddha-sun will shine, swiftly melting them.26 Such evidence suggests that the trope in Senshi's poem, kumo-. gosho, has its origins not only in the figurative conventions of secular verse but also in the language of ritual sermons and songs composed by men for performance or presentation as prayer for the souls of 25 In Honcho bunshui 7CJ4j., book 35; see Kuroita Katsumi M;E", ed., Shintei zoho kokushi taikei. 38 vols.

The six desires (rokuyoku NXO) are those that beset unenlightened mortals (bonbu JLt): desire for attractive forms; for attractive persons; for persons whose movements are attrac- tive; for those who speech is attractive; for those whose skin is attractive; and for those whose whole person is beauteous. The numerical term is used here in balanced parallelism with the five obstructions: its numerical aspect is perhaps of greater functional significance in the verse than is the content of the term. Analogous "number play" in several waka is discussed be- low. My readings of this and the preceding ganmon passage are adapted from Taira, "Chuisei Bukky6 to josei: " see especially p. 92. See also Taira, "Kyiu Bukky6 to josei. " In both arti- cles, Taira argues that discrimination (sabetsu) against women in Japanese Buddhism is ab- sent in "kyut Bukkyo " (pre-Nara and Nara-period Buddhism) but emerges in the latter half of the ninth century (as evidenced by the language of such documents as these), due to several factors including a general decline in the social position of women, coinciding with the rise of paternal authority, and an intensification of the idea that women are a natural source of pollu- tion (kegare). His evidence is the contemporaneous emergence of references to "itsutsu no sawari" and similar rhetoric in a variety of literary texts and other kinds of documents.</page><page sequence="20">408 EDWARD KAMENS dead women-a context in which, as it happens, some of the earli- est nijIhappon no uta were conceived. It may be, however, that the composers of such ganmon borrowed this figurative language from still other texts-perhaps from poems. In any case, the figure ap- pears to have been a fixed formula even by the time that Senshi used it (ca. 1012), and it is used again and again (perhaps in imita- tion of her) for a long time thereafter. For example, in the Shakkyo section of her offering of one hundred poems, composed as one of fourteen contributors to the Kyuian hyakushu X%Efi submitted to the retired Emperor Sutoku in 1150, the woman called Taikenmon'in Horikawa wr fii included the following: nagaki yo ni mayou sawari no kumo harete tsuki no mikao o miru yoshimogana27 How I would like to have those obstructing clouds that make me lose my way in this long night be swept away, so that I might see the face of the blessed moon! The sweeping away of the obstructing clouds is only one of the ele- ments of this poem that can be identified among Horikawa's in- heritances: the long night of ignorance and confusion (nagakiyo) and the face of the full moon (tsuki no mikao, an object of meditation through which full enlightenment can be achieved, and a symbol of that enlightenment, or of the companionship of a benevolent, guid- ing Buddha) upon which the poem-speaker yearns to gaze were also, by Horikawa's time, conventional elements of the Shakkyoka vocabulary. Like the clouds/obstructions trope, these figures were also particularly potent because analogous usages in secular verse (particularly love poems in which the depiction of confusion, ob- struction, and yearning gazes is equally fitting) gave them res- 27 SKT 4.294. Horikawa was one of several daughters of Minamoto Akinaka (NYf1f+ 1064-1138) who distinguished themselves in court service and literary activities in the mid- twelfth century. The dates of her own birth and death are not known, but some other dates are: she participated in three utaawase organized by her father in 1128, took Buddhist vows when her mistress Taikenmon'in did, in 1142, compiled a collection of her own verse in the year following Taikenmon'in's death in 1145, andjoined with her sisterJ6saimon'in Hyoe ? P R in contributing to the Kyulan hyakushu in 1150 (see below).</page><page sequence="21">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 409 onance with other poetic texts and contexts.28 Yet, since such ele- ments were used repeatedly in specifically devotional contexts, their patterns of resonance must also have pointed toward other devotion- al poems. Thus, for example, it is of Horikawa's "nagakiyo" poem as well as of its various models, composed in various contexts, that one thinks as one reads the following verse presented in Rinkashu f T*K, the collected works of Gotokudaiji no Sadaijin (Fujiwara) Sanesada ; (1139-1191), as one composed "on the kokoro of the 'Devadatta' Chapter, on a woman's behalf" (Daibabon no kokoro o, onna ni kawarite A4i6.'?z frR&gt;ht r ) C): ware mo sa wa itsutsu no sawari kumo harete kokoro no tsuki no sumu yoshimogana29 How I wish that those five obstructing clouds might clear away like that for me, and let the light of the moon that shines within me be pure! Having been ceded the woman's voice, Sanesada prays that the Dragon-girl's experience may be hers as well. Lest there be any mistake about the function of the trope, Sanesada makes it all too clear that the itsutsu no sawari are the clouds (kumo) that ought to part 28 Following on a point made earlier, it might be said that the Shakkyo sections within the Kyuan hyakushu (the structure of which is modeled on the more famous Horikawa hyakushu I)JII H4 of 1105-6) are "secularized Shakkyoka, " quasi-devotional sequences embedded within os- tensibly non-devotional sequences. The hundred-poem sequence makes its way through a series of conventional secular topics as well as quasi-religious ones, creating a multi-faceted context that is several steps removed from the more explicitly devotional setting of (for exam- ple) Senshi's Hosshin wakashii verses. In other words, multi-faceted contextualization modifies the emphasis on the implicit relationship between religious ideas and texts and the poems in the Shakkyo section which are based on those ideas and texts, by shifting emphasis to the crea- tive compositional process, the act of poem-making itself. The sequence of topic categories and the number of poems in each category in the Kyuan hyakushu is: spring [20], summer[10], autumn [20], winter [10], love [20], rites (jingi) [2], festive celebration (keiga) [2] , Buddhism (Shakkyo) [5], impermanence (mujo) [2], parting [1], travel [5], acrostics (mono no na) [2], and finally a section called "tanka" consisting of a choka (a "long poem") or a choka and hanka (long poem and short envoy) pair. Within the Shakkyo sequence, the five topics addressed vary. Several poets (including Horikawa and her sister Hy6e) address a series of five sutras, i.e., Kegongyo, Hodokyo, Hannyakyo, Hokekyo, and Nehangyo; others address a series of quota- tions from these sutras, or from just one of them, or simply offer five poems on general religious themes.

Thus, the five obstructions become a metonymic "five clouds" (itsutsu no kumo) in a poem in one of the several sets of njiihappon no uta written by a well-known later practitioner, the priest Jien MH9 (1155-1225). In Shu-gyokushul *EA (Jien's personal anthology3") this poem has as preface the four-character kotobagaki/dai WQAk, "all seeing the Dragon-girl. . . miru mo ureshi minami no umi no irokuzu no itsutsu no kumo no haruru keshiki 012 How happy this scaly creature from the southern seas must be to witness this clearing of the five [obstructing] clouds! The speaker of the poem (potentially, but not necessarily, Jien him- self) takes the role of one of the male observers of the Dragon-girl's feat: for him, like them, her physical transformation (here, of spe- cies as well as of sex) and the parting of the symbolic clouds obstruct- ing her path are cause for rejoicing. Miru mo ureshi corresponds to the phrase A ... C?t}A7E reproduced in abbreviated form in the poem's preface: in the sutra the subject of this phrase's verbs miru A1 ("see") and kangi [su] 9' ("rejoice") is mina W ("everyone [who was there, watching]"), but Jien allows his "seeing" and "rejoic- ing" a greater leverage, as actions performed both by the Dragon- girl and her many spectators. Still, the cause for happiness and the real object of praise remains the Lotus itself, the text and doctrine that possess the wondrous power to work such transformations on young female sea creatures (irokuzu) and thus to bring the same kind of happiness to other inferior and handicapped beasts. The focus on transformation from the pathetic to the ideal state in such expressions ofjoy and wonder in the Lotus-celebrations which 30 While its use is by no means limited to devotional poems, the exclamatory -yoshimogana ("How fine it would be!"; also used in Horikawa's poem) is quite frequently used in poems that enact appropriations of scriptural texts as expressions of personal desire; compare also Senshi's first Hosshin wakashu7 verse, discussed above. 31 The first version of ShuigyokushuT was compiled by the noted calligrapher Son'en (#F3, 1298-1373), who was a still later contributor to the corpus of devotional poetry; see below. 32 SKT 3.270.</page><page sequence="23">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 411 are consonant with the sentiments described in the sutra text itself- is the dominant mode of addressing the "Devadatta" chapter topos in waka from the earliest stages of the njzihappon no uta tradition. In terms of surviving texts, that tradition seems to begin in 1002, when Fujiwara Michinaga IYAJ (966-1027) commissioned several sets of Lotus poems as memorial offerings for his late sister, the dowager empress Higashi Sanj6in a-iEAR (i.e., Fujiwara Senshi *!Wf [961-1001]). In sequences that may well have been written in Higashi Sanj6in's memory and which are preserved in the collected works of two of the outstanding poets of that time, Akazome Emon T,rN (957/964?-1041?) and Fujiwara Kint6 MV-9f (966-1041), we find poems on the kokoro of the "Devadatta" chapter which match Daisaiin Senshi' s Hosshin wakashui poem as well as Jien' s in both mood and imagery: watatsumi no miya o idetaru hodo mo naku. sawari no hoka ni narinikeru ka na (Akazome Emon shii 438)33 As soon as she emerged from her palace in the sea she achieved a state beyond every obstruction! sawari 6mi nami o wakekoshi mi o kaete hachisu no ue ni iru to koso mire (Kinto- shu- 27 1 )14 We have seen how she changed that body that had made its way through the waves, where obstacles were plenty, and took her place upon the Lotus! And, in Shin kokin wakashui (Shakkyoka, 1928), we find Michinaga's own "Devadatta" poem, apparently for the same occasion: watatsuumi no soko yori kitsuru hodo mo naku kono mi nagara ni mi o zo kiwamuru35 As soon as she emerged from the depths of the sea, in that very body she ended that body's life. 33 SKT3.322. 34 SKT3.305. 35 Minemura Fumito Wt#4A, ed., Shin kokin wakashui, NKBZ 26.575.</page><page sequence="24">412 EDWARD KAMENS Such poems have special significance if read in the context of remem- brance of the dead: in celebrating the Dragon-girl's release from her former (female/animal) state, these poems simultaneously celebrate Higashi Sanjoin's release from her wordly sufferings-her perma- nent liberation from earth, mortal life, and womanhood. Implicit in all these poems is the belief, or hope, that she, too, has made her way at length through troubled waters and, at the moment of death, has passed over all barriers (sawari no hoka ni narinikeru) and instantly attained new form (mi o kaete . . . ) and that though a woman (kono mi nagara) she has put an end to her woman-ness and has achieved an ultimate, ideal state (mi o zo kiwamuru). Neither the loss of gender nor the loss of life is mourned: rather, it is what has been gained, despite all the odds and after all the struggle, that is emphasized in prayer for a dead woman who now lives again as something quite other than she once was. Three hundred years later, the same celebratory mode of address- ing the same topic-text ("everyone, seeing that Dragon-girl become a Buddha . . . ')-now removed from the context of mourning ritual-was still the one most likely to be adopted when Prince Muneyoshi 'ANT (1311-?, a son of Emperor Godaigo who, like Jien before him, served multiple terms as Abbot of Enryakuji [Tendai zasu I7Fii]), composed a njiihappon no uta series within a thousand-poem sequence (senshu uta): watatsuumi no ashima no nami o wakekite mo itsutsu no sawari naki zo ureshiki36 What a happy thing for her! She had to make her way through reeds and waves to cross the sea, but then the five obstructions were no more! Like his predecessors, Muneyoshi takes special notice of the Dragon-girl's effortful journey, over great distance, toward her in the end, there were no barriers in her way, for once these barriers are gone, or are passed over, release (from womanhood, among other things) is permanent. The eight-year-old Dragon-girl mana- 36 Rika wakashui -TfQJE [the personal anthology of Muneyoshi Shinn6] 883; SKT 7.750.</page><page sequence="25">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 413 ges all this because, while still a sea-creature, she heard Ma-njusri preach the Lotus; thus, the sutra is itself the agent that enables her to overcome such obstacles that it may (rhetorically) impose.37 It is this that Muneyoshi acknowledges and celebrates in his poem. Likewise, in the "Medicine King" chapter, the sutra, and specifi- cally that chapter of it, are advertised as literal panaceas. In this case, relatively little effort on the part of the salvation-seeker is re- quired: all manner of beings, suffering in various undesirable states-including that of being female-have only to hear and un- derstand the text in order for it to work its cure on them.

Once again, we may note, Senshi indicates no resistance whatever to the notion of loss of sex: she looks forward, rather than back, and betrays not the slightest hint of regret, for there can be little doubt that her "sorrows" will come to an end when she is transformed. And so it is toward that future metamor- phosis, a recapitulation of the Dragon-girl's change of state, that she directs her hopes. And she has learned to do so, the poem im- plies, through the very encounter with the passage in the sutra that is its occasion and its frame. Male voices celebrating this same passage in waka also urge women to look toward and prepare themselves for that future change. For example, in a sequence of one hundred and forty-seven poems on a series of one hundred passages from the Lotus (Ei hyaku- shu waka UW5kIV), Jien composed two on lines from the "Medi- cine King" chapter that come shortly after those used by Senshi: :l-k _ PIP ftWAf koko ni oite my'ju shite, sunawachi anraku sekai . . . ni yukite. ..42 "([upon hearing this Chapter,] she shall end her life [as a wom- an], and shall go right away to the world-sphere of Comfort [Sukhavati, i.e., Amida's Pure Land] . . ."

But the first poem in the pair does something else again: yuzukuyo sasu ya okabe ni tsuyu kiete nishi ni hirakuru ominaeshi ka na44 On the slope where the early moon shines down and dries the dew the maidenflower blooms in the west. Here, Jien paints a symbolic landscape: a benevolent moon (the Buddha, delivering his "cure") casts Its rays upon a hillside where grows the "maidenflower" (ominaeshi, standing-in here, as so often in waka, for woman herself) and dries up the dew (tsuyu, i.e., all worldly taint), allowing the flower/woman to "bloom in the west," to dwell in tranquil splendor in the Pure Land. To achieve a similar transportation, Jien suggests, women need only do as di- rected in the sutra, and he reminds them to do so in the direct, non- metaphorical address of the second verse. Long before Jien wrote these poems, this ominaeshi trope-based in turn on the conventional substitution of this particular flower for specific as well as generic female referents in secular waka-had earned the flower a special role in certain exercises of the itsutsu no sawari topos. Given, on the one hand, the poem's interaction with the "Medicine King" passage as textual topos, and, on the other hand, the fact that the figure had been so used beforehand in analo- gous contexts, the referent of the ominaeshi in Jien' s poem could only be woman as conceived from the viewpoint of the sutra, a'being burdened by special handicaps and in need of special benevolence, who must have the (Buddha's) moonlight to cleanse and transform her. But, as we shall see, the ominaeshi that had come to play this spe- cial role in itsutsu no sawari poems was a hybrid flower, cultivated in that special ground where Buddhist and secular images of woman 4 Ibid.

THE MAIDENFLOWER'S METAMORPHOSES The ominaeshi has been called upon to play dual roles, often simul- taneously, ever since its earliest recorded appearances in waka.45 For example, the classification of the following verse, Man 'yoshu- 2279, as one of a group of love poems in which autumnal flowers are the metaphorical substitutes for objects of yearning and affection (aki no somon F&amp;irt: hana ni yosu tE), indicates an early conven- tionalization of the ominaeshi's double function as both flower (i.e., patrinia scabiosaefolia46) and "maiden" (omina47) waga sato ni ima saku hana no ominaeshi taenu kokoro ni nao koinikeri48 I cannot restrain my heart, but go on yearning for the maidenflower that now is blooming at my home. Though the poem is fundamentally ambiguous (is it really a flow- er or flowers, or really a woman or women, for whom the poem- speaker yearns?), the classification as a "metaphorical poem" tips 45 For a brief discussion of the development of the ominaeshi's roles in waka, see Katagiri Y6ichi 1ft -, Utamakura utakotoba jiten (Kadokawa shoten, 1983), pp. 459-60. A scan of the examples included under the topic "ominaeshi" in Kokin waka rokujo will confirm and aug- ment this picture of the figure's early use and development. See Ishizuka Tatsumaro ;Htf ) and Tabayashi Yoshinobu WHMZf{, eds., Kosho kokinka rokujo (Yu1seid6, 1984) 2.294-300. 46 The perennial plant puts forth a cluster of small yellow-petaled blooms atop spindly stalks from late summer through early autumn (i.e., September through October in the modern calendar). It grows in all parts ofJapan; in the wild it favors sunny hillside grasslands dominated by miscanthus sinensis (susuki). See Numata Makoto EE WA and Asano Sadao M;S M*, Nihon shokubutsu seitaizukan (Biological Flora ofJapan). 2 vols. (Tsukiji shokan, 1969-70), 1. 160-61. 47 The word "omina," (i.e womina, 7 " I), for young girl, is easily attested (in the Kojiki, for example); but the meaning, if any, of the syllables -eshi (i.e., -feshi, -- i2/) has not been ex- plained. In the Man'y6gana text of MYS 2279 the name of the flower is written Mnu1Y; another common phonetic spelling is Jffi?. Later, it is usually written with three characters equivalent to "maiden flower," 4PITh, an orthography that is itself an invitation to word play. There is a related plant called otokoeshi 9fiE,, "boy flower," (with white rather than yellow flowers), which does not make it into the waka lexicon. 48 Takagi Ichinosuke j 1*iJr j, Gomi Tomohide A*O-*, and Ono Susumu tf , eds., Man ny5shui, NKBT 3.138.</page><page sequence="29">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 417 the interpretive scales toward the anthropomorphical reading.49 But here, as elsewhere, it is primarily the aural ambiguity of the flower's name that facilitates the ominaeshi's development as an object for word-play, and even when other conventional schemes of associa- tion, such as the seasonal, are the basis for its presence in a given poem, its character as an element of the natural landscape will al- ways be defined by its identification with the female sex, and its treatment will be tailored accordingly. It was perhaps with that potential for playful treatment in mind that Yamanoue Okura WJIItA (660-733?) listed the ominaeshi as one of the seven flowers, among those that bloom in autumn fields, to be especially favored as subjects of verse (MYS 1537-8).5? Similar- ly, when a group of gentlemen gathered for a party at the residence of Otomo Yakamochi t4 4 (718?-785) "on the seventh night of the eighth month," (the height of autumn, in the old calendar), the ominaeshi figured prominently among the poems they composed (MYS 3943-51); and in two of the three ominaeshi poems in the group, the flower is treated as possessor of (feminine) charms that men find hard to resist (MYS 3943-44.)51 By the early eleventh cen- tury, when he was compiling a handbook of conventional waka treatments, Noin ,S1W1 (988-1050?) would prescribe (in stronger language than he used in his comments about most other lexical sub- jects) that "when writing about the ominaeshi, one must compare it to [or, treat it as a metaphor for] woman (ominaeshi, onna ni tatoete yomubeshi)."52 And, if a verse by Minamoto Shitag6 i1U1N (911- 4 Angela Yiu's study of hiyuka (poems formally classified as "metaphorical poems" in the Man yfshii) has important implications for the study of other metaphorical operations in Man yo verse.

Hearing this name, I'm tempted to offer a proposal, but fear she won't like the frosty covering on my wrinkled face. This short shi, like virtually every ominaeshi waka as well, is a game about a name, and, whenever men play this particular game, in either of these poetic languages, the stakes seem to be the same. Thus, a large proportion of the ominaeshi poems included in the au- tumn and other books of the Sandaishuk i , the three earliest (and pattern-setting) imperial anthologies, are poems in which male voices treat the flower as an object of their sexual desire: such flow- ers (like the women whom their name suggests) are reproached for distracting men from their purposes, or for boldly intruding upon male spaces. In Kokin wakashuk 227, for example, Furu no Imamichi twits them for growing on Otokoyama ("Man Mountain"), in a double-play that takes advantage of the suggestiveness of both the horticultural subject and the toponymic setting. In the second of the three autumn books of Gosen wakashu/ the flower is collectively characterized as a fickle creature (276, ". . . hana no kokoro no ada 5 Kakimura, ed., Honcho monzui chu7shaku 1.119 and Kawaguchi and Shida, eds., NKBT 73. 118. The characters *J9!, were used in Chinese to refer to various other kinds of flow- ers, but it is clear that Shitag6 is here addressing the Japanese ominaeshi rather than some other (more exotic?) continental flower. 54 The basis for this comparison is a passage in Wen xuan (from Emperor Wen's letter to Minister Zhong [ in book 42), which compares the color of a yellow jewel to that of boiled millet.

Tsurayuki's description of his preparations for this night of love links this poem to a far more famous one, the anonymous song of the man who anticipates a night spent in the embraces of the siren of the Uji Bridge (Kokin wakashui 689): like her, the generic woman for whom the ominaeshi stands in poems by men may be unreliable, even treacherous-but she is, for all that, irresistible.56 What, then, is left for women to do with the ominaeshi topic? Their exercises of it go virtually unnoticed in the Sandaishu/, but that does not mean that no such exercises took place. For example, at the so- called Teijiin Maidenflower Contest (Teijiin no ontoki no ominaeshi awase +rnWWi-) held in the autumn of 898, choice speci- mens of the flower as well as poems about it were offered for judg- ment by teams composed of both sexes: the left was victorious in the flower show, but in poetry the right prevailed. The hostess, Empress Onshi ST, consort of the retired Emperor Uda (a.k.a. Teijiin), contributed to the winning effort with this verse: kimi ni yori nobe o hanareshi ominaeshi onaji kokoro ni aki o todomeyo A maidenflower that has left its field for you, my lord, joins with you, with one heart, to perpetuate this au- tumn . 5 Katagiri Y6ichi, ed., Gosen wakashiu. Shin nihon koten bungaku taikei (Iwanami shoten, 1990), 6.102. 56 In Kokin wakashiu 238, Taira Sadafun makes an even more explicit (though more playful) suggestion that the flower is an ideal sex partner. This poem's compositional setting-follow- ing a flower-viewing excursion in the Sagano gff district-also seems to be part of the de- velopment of a traditional association of that locale with this particular flower. Versions of KKS 226 and Shii wakah-A 1098, discussed below, also place the "action" at Sagano. 5 SKT 5.28.</page><page sequence="32">420 EDWARD KAMENS Onshi shifts the perspective on the topos, describing herself as the fe- male flower plucked from its native soil to serve its royal male master. (The conventional scenario of male attraction to beds of fe- male flowers here becomes the socio-political drama of royal mar- riage.) She now gladly assists in the effort to do honor to her spouse and to his reign by convening the flower-and-poetry contest, to adorn his reputation with marks of high cultural and aesthetic achievement. Several poems composed for this occasion were later included in Kokin wakashui or other chokusenshui: one of those included in Kokin wakashut (KKS 230) is by Onshi's brother, Fujiwara Toki- hira RNM+ (871-909), and another (KKS 235) is by Mibu no Tada- mine I,-W, (?-?): hito no miru koto ya kurushiki ominaeshi akigiri ni nomi tachikakururamu58 Do maidenflowers find it so unbearable to be seen? It seems they do nothing but cower in the autumn mist. In Tadamine's poem the flowers have turned coy, or at any rate cautious; they huddle together to protect themselves from (male) marauders. Their susceptibility to men, who can take possession of them with but a glance, is also the concern of a poem not entered into but written for the same contest, by the great woman poet Ise: nobegoto ni tachikakuretsutsu ominaeshi fuku aki kaze no miezu mo aranamu59 Maidenflowers huddling in every field: I hope the blustering autumn wind will not discover them! Ise, who is perhaps more honest about relations between the sexes than Onshi can afford to be, reads the ominaeshi's physiography not as a coy withdrawal but as a survival tactic. She would prefer that 58 Saeki, ed., Kokin wakashiu, p. 147. The high percentage of utaawase poems in the Kokin wakashiu Autumn (1) ominaeshi group-eight out of thirteen-can be interpreted as evidence of the flower's achievement of particular prominence among the conventionalized topoi ad- dressed in such formal compositional settings in the late ninth and early tenth centuries. That achievement, in turn, is probably attributable to the ominaeshi topos' nominal malleability- its inherent invitation to textual manipulation-rather than to the status of the plant itself. 59 SKT 5.29.</page><page sequence="33">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 421 the female flowers be left undisturbed, and she hopes against hope (it is really too late) that the searching eyes of the (male) "wind" -a force that blows unabated, bending nature to its will-will not find them. Again, a primal drama is played out here. In the mock battle of the "maidenflower contest" itself-a playful contest of words, fought for the prize of royal favor and prestige-the even more fun- damental contest of courtship is staged and restaged again, in verse. Throughout the performance, the ominaeshi plays its mixed role as voluptuous and susceptible woman, inviting and resisting, exposed to and awaiting the incursions of men. In Onshi's poem, the flower dutifully yields; but Ise still dreams-half-jokingly?-of means of es- cape.60 Such zestful but earnest play with language-a reveling in its am- biguity, its suggestiveness, its plasticity-is a hallmark of Kokin-era poetry, particularly that of the era of the Rokkasen, the "six sages of song": yet often, underneath it all, lie serious sub-texts, the presence of which further complicate and deepen the play. We see such complex play, in particular, in the ominaeshi poems of Arch- bishop Henj6 (816-890): this "sage of song" (whom Tsurayuki found rather superficial [makoto sukunaku61]) is much given to the dis- play of his own cleverness-even when he is adopting the pseudo- serious pose of moralist, chastising women by chastising their floral emblem (KKS 1016): aki no no ni namamekitateru ominaeshi ana kashigamashi hana mo hitotoki62 Maidenflowers flaunting your colors in autumn fields: what a noisy show you make!- but flowers, too, live only once! 60 The scenario may be even more complicated. Ise, a senior member of Onshi's en- tourage, had given birth to a male child conceived by Uda in 895, three years before this ominaeshi contest. And, previous to that, she had had affairs with both Tokihira and his brother Nakahira I+B (875-945). In poems anthologized as Gosen wakashii 349-50, Nakahira equates an ominaeshi plucked from Ise's garden for presentation to the cloistered Uda with the garden's owner, with whom both men have been intimate, and Ise, in response, urges him not to cling too desperately to his memories. 61 In the kana preface to the Kokin wakashu; see Saeki, ed., Kokin wakashu, p. 100.

The same thing can be said of yet another of his tongue-in-cheek colloquies with the flower (KKS 226): na ni medete oreru bakari zo ominaeshi ware ochiniki to hito ni kataru na63 I've plucked you, maidenflower, only because I was intrigued by your name: now don't go telling people that I've fallen [away from my vows]. One of the jokes here is a joke on Henjo himself, or on his image: beguiled by the flower's charming name, he says, he has stooped to pluck it-but let no one think that therefore he has compromised his priestly vows of chastity (which could only be the case if the flower were no flower but was actually the woman that its name suggests).64 There are almost more conceits here than one can count-and perhaps that is why this poem received high praise on into later times: in Sanzoshi _I1IJ, a collection of Matsuo Bash6's instructions to his poetic disciples, it is proclaimed a model of playful wit (haikai no tehon nari.)65 63 NKBT8.145. 64 Ozawa Masao 'J41iRJE5 has identifed KKS 226 as the earliest poem in which the ominaeshi is explicitly given its anthropomorphic personification (gijinka *AtL) as woman; but, as the foregoing examples demonstrate, this may only be a matter of degree, or of read- ing practice. The Man 'yoshu compilers, for example, would not have put MYS 2279 in a group of metaphorical poems had they not been aware of the potential for reading the poem an- thropomorphically. See Ozawa, Kokinsha no sekai (Hanawa shob6, 1961), p. 112. 65 In Kido Saiz6 1K4tA and Imoto N6ichi #*A_-, eds., Renga ron shu, hairon sh, NKBT 66.383. In Sanzoshi it is said that Henj6 had fallen off his horse when he wrote the poem: this gloss on ochiniki ("I have fallen") is traceable to the kotobagaki paired with the poem in Henj shui (SKT 3.26 [poem no. 24]), which is also the basis for the presentation of the poem in the interlinear notes by an anonymous later commentator that appear with most ver- sions of Tsurayuki's kana preface to the Kokin wakashu. (See NKBT 8.100.) In the body of the KKS, the poem is labeled "topic unknown" (dai shirazu.) Bash6 is also the author of a hokku imitation of KKS 226, in which he (or, the speaker) aligns himself with Henj6 as yet another supposedly sober gentleman who cannot resist the flower:</page><page sequence="35">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 423 A similar self-satirical scenario, involving yet another spoof of Henj6's priestly misogyny, is enacted in Shuii wakashu (1098), com- plete with scene-setting kotobagaki: bo no senzai mi ni onnadomo no modekitarikereba [S6j6 Henj6] MO 'U_Q AK* E i e t 5 - t ~ttt il [WEMIS . . . koko ni shi mo nani niouran ominaeshi hito no monoii saganikuki yo ni66 miru ni ga mo oreru bakari zo ominaeshi When I see it, I just have to pick it, too: the maidenflower. (In Otani Tokuz6 t and Nakamura Shunj6 't4 t, ed., Bashi kushu, NKBT 45.179.) Ga mo oreru means both "I (like Henjo) have plucked it, too," and, more idiomatical- ly, "I have yielded (to temptation, and have relinquished my indifference.)" This hokku first appeared in Kitamura Kigin's haikai collection Zokurenju f4;, published in 1676, where it is attributed to "Munefusa of Ueno in Iga," an indication that it is perhaps a composition from very early in Bash6's career. Ota Nanpo *J33l*X (1749-1823, a.k.a. Yomo no Akara V1JAt, Shokusanjin Q[IiA, etc.) took all the elements of the constructed KKS 226 scenario-the supposed fall from the horse after the encounter with the tempting female/flower, the Sagano setting, and the joking posture of Henj6's poem itself-into the parodistic realm of kyoka Ha, in a pun-laden poem found in several of his collections: ominaeshi kuchi mo sagano ni tatta ima Henj6 san ga ochinasanshita Those gossipy flower-maidens are already saying that Henj6-san has just fallen at Sagano. To describe someone as "kuchisaganashi" is to say that he or she has no shame about what he or she says about others, but here it also offers "Sagano" as the site where the tempting ominaeshi "stood" (tatta) and where Henj6 has just now (tatta ima) fallen (ochinasanshita); and the -nasanshita in ochinasanshita ("he has fallen") is itself recognizable as a Tokugawa-period brothel-district locution, used here to re-read the whole re-constructed scenario from the per- spective of and in the language of the pleasure quarters. In one of Nanpo's anthologies, this kyoka appears with a kotobagaki that says the poem was inscribed on a painting depicting Henj6's fall from the horse, and that it proceeds from a feeling that "Henj6's request not to tell anyone of his fall is too much to swallow" (Sojo Henjo rakuba no kaisan, ware ochiniki to. kuchi- dome mo kokoromotonakereba). In this context, the courtesan in whose voice the kyoka speaks is herself cast as someone who cannot resist an opportunity to fool around with the malleable and variably suggestive elements of the poem and the story that has accrued to it. Henj6 him- self started the game some nine centuries earlier, later poets and commentators added some features, and now Nanpo's artificial courtesan (not an ominaeshi IPT? but its descendant, a joro k*P-a literally de-flowered maiden) sends it all up again, in Edo street-talk, or a literary imitation thereof.

Along with the expected playful confusion between the flowers and the women admiring them, Henj6 plays also with the idea that, for the sake of his reputation as a high-ranking clergyman, he must avoid even the whisper of suspicion that he is less than perfectly true to his vows of celibacy, and so he pretends that the women who have come to see the flowers outside his dwelling threaten to violate the purity of this priestly precinct. What we have here are simultane- ous, or overlapping, masquerades: the flowers become the women who view them, and Henj6 plays opposite them as the chaste and chastening old monk who protests too much, all for the sake of the joke. But one reason that this joke works is that at least one of this poem's subtexts can be said to be something "real," a part of the lived experience of men and women like Henj6 and his visitors. This subtext, or pretext, is the practice (apparently, or ostensibly, upheld more assiduously in the Heian period than in later times) of barring women from entry into many of those spaces and structures in which Buddhist clergymen worked and dwelt.67 Henj6's willing- ness to treat this scenario farcically perhaps bespeaks a less than rigorous attitude toward such proscriptions-or perhaps it is simply another example of a tendency (not exclusively his) to regard virtual- no locale in "monoii saganikuki, " which literally describes society (hito no . . . yo, "the world") as "viciously chatty." 67 The formalized exclusion of women was most conspicuous in the monastic rules of En- ryakuji (Hieizan) and the complexes on K6yasan and Ominesan (i.e., Kinpusen), from which women were barred until an act of the Meiji reform government abolished the practice in 1872; by custom, however, women are still not allowed to enter the sacred precincts on Ominesan or on Ushiroyama in Okayama Prefecture.

One might not expect the practice of excluding women from Bud- dhist precincts (nyonin kinsei [or kinzei] kA,1) to be a laughing mat- ter; elsewhere it is taken quite seriously indeed.68 Yet a confronta- tion with this very practice is once again treated as an occasion for the display of wit in a poem attributed to Izumi Shikibu gfilin in Shin senzai wakashui (no. 894). As so often, the indispensable kotoba- gaki sets the scene: ie no mae o h6shi no ominaeshi o mochite torikeru o izuku e yuku zo to towasekereba, Hie no yama no nenbutsu no tatebana ni namu motemakaru to iikereba, musubitsukekeru: na ni shi owaba itsutsu no sawari aru mono o urayamashiku mo noboru hana ka na69 When a monk passed [Izumi Shikibu's] house carrying a maiden- flower, she asked him where he was going, and when he said, "I am taking this flower as an offering for the nenbutsu rite on Mount Hie," she wrote this and attached it to the flower: If this truly is its name, it faces the Five Obstructions, and yet how enviable, this flower that mounts the heights! 70 This poem is not just a playful protest against Enryakuji's in- stitutionalized misogyny: the hallowed practice of personifying ominaeshi as woman is also among the several targets at which the poet aims her jesting darts. She mimics Ariwara Narihira's famous "capital bird" poem (KKS 41 1 I Ise monogatari dan 9: "na ni shi owaba 68 In Sanboe, for example, Tamenori makes a special point of informing his reader, the Im- perial Princess Sonshi 4T, that even if she cannot attend certain rites performed at Enryaku- ji, she can observe similar rites at T6ji and Hossh6ji.

(It scales the mountain and finds a place upon the altar [noboru, in two roles], while she herself can approach neither of these "heights. ") But, then, does she really care, or does she simply want to tease the monk, or the flower, or the reader-or all three? This poem-tale (the verse is inseparable from its prose preface) may be more about Izumi Shikibu's sharp mind and quick tongue than about her religious fervor; still, it is in part the "reality" of nyonin kinsei, and the commanding authority of the Enryakuji itself, that furnish the backdrop to the stage on which her bravura performance unfolds. The lateness of this poem's first appearance (in the eighteenth of the chokusenshui, compiled in 1359, over three hundred years after Izumi Shikibu's death) suggests that the scenario may be apocry- phal, and may not really have much to do with Izumi Shikibu at all. Rather, it may be, among other things, a parody of the custom of sending poems along with and attached to gifts, particularly flowers-an exchange that most commonly took place between friends or lovers. In other words, this may be a story about pseudo- elegance, about an aesthetic turned on its head, and Izumi Shikibu may simply have been called in from central casting, as it were, to play her part. But, whether "real" or not, serious or not, this little drama that supposedly took place outside Izumi Shikibu's home was offered to readers in even later times as (of all things) a morality play. Superfi- cially, it is the poem's play with the ominaeshi trope that earns it its privileged position in the concluding section of Ominaeshi monogatari kRUMCM10, a didactic kanazoshi {t&amp;$# published in 1661 and be- lieved by many to have been assembled by the scholar-poet Kita- 71 There are at least twenty poems that begin with the clause "na ni shi o[u], " or a variant thereof, in the chokusensha alone.

From that time, all the maidenflowers produced in the es- tates of Omi province were committed in perpetuity for delivery to the Chuid6 on Mt. Hie for use as altar flowers, and this is still the case; so when you offer maidenflowers for the Hie nenbutsu altar decoration, it is said, you are simply follow- ing in the footsteps of Izumi Shikibu. Since the maidenflower is the flower that grew from the grave of the wife of Ono no Yorikaze zJ'!i #jl and is said to be a flow- er of the female gender, it is truly inspiring that it should serve as the altar flower for the Hie nenbutsu.74 Can there be any doubt that if a woman, having received 72 Sato Ritsu Wt 0 '9, ed., Ominaeshi monogatari (honkoku hen).

Nihon josei seikatsu shi 3: kinsei (Tokyo Daigaku Shup- pankai, 1990), pp. 174-75. 74 The reference is to the N6 play Ominameshi I?lff, in which a traveling monk encoun- ters a ghost who turns out to be that of Yorikaze. The ghost shows the monk the graves of Yorikaze and his wife on Otokoyama 93 [i. In the second part of the play the ghost of the wife, Ominameshi, joins Yorikaze's to relate the story of her tragic death: she drowned her- self near Otokoyama in the mistaken belief that Yorikaze had transferred his affections to another woman, and he then died of remorse. Both ghosts ask the monk to pray for their release from lingering passion, and the play ends with their prayer that the ominaeshi may be equally as qualifed as the lotus for eternal life in paradise. Authorship of the play is attributed to both Zeami and Kiami ! ; it is known to have been one of the plays staged at the Awataguchi Kanjin Sarugaku Em L VJitA* performance of 1505. The seed idea for the play seems to be a section of the kana preface to the Kokin wakashk which suggests the associa- tion of two otherwise unrelated poems (KKS 889, in which an old man regrets that he is no lon- ger as strong as Otokoyama ["Man Mountain"] and KKS 1016, Henj6's arch criticism of the</page><page sequence="40">428 EDWARD KAMENS human form, utters the nenbutsu, she will achieve buddahood just like that maiden- flower that climbed the holy mountain? Long ago, the eight-year-old daughter of the dragon king floated up from the bottom of the sea. In the present, the maiden- flower climbs to the sacred heights of Mount Hie and becomes the seed for equal achievement of buddhahood by such non-sentient entities as grasses and trees, na- tions and lands (somoku kokudo shikkaijobutsu no tane to narihaberu).75 It serves thus as the altar flower on the occasion of the nenbutsu, but since this book is called 'Tales of the Maidenflower, ' those who read or hear its story here will no doubt become its dharma companions (zenchishiki AMA to narubeshi ).71 The Ominaeshi monogatari gloss on Izumi Shikibu's poem reads the trope of "maidenflower" for "maiden" as a literal exchange, per- petuated in practices that are traced to Izumi Shikibu's precedent. It also shows that the conditions that led to that exchange, or substi- tution, persisted into the present of the kanazoshi retelling of the tale, in mid-Tokugawa times. Since those conditions-the exclusion of women from the Hieizan precincts-persist in that narrative pre- sent, the trope can be read as something that still has relevance in that same narrative present: young women who read the text can learn from it that the flower can imitate the Dragon-girl, in overcom- ing obstacles that may seem to lie in its path. Like her, they will shed the innate handicaps of womanhood, cleanse themselves, and emerge pure and perfect. And if their physical exclusion from the mountain (ostensibly justified by the belief in their innate impurity, and the danger that they pose for men) causes them to feel what Izumi Shikibu felt (the narrator calls it "envious resentment," urayami) they can overcome that feeling by offering their own floral stand-ins for the nenbutsu altar, and will thus become her spiritual peers (zenchishiki-literally, faithful practitioners who follow in the path of an esteemed teacher). ominaeshi 's vanity. KKS 227, mentioned above, also links Otokoyama and ominaeshi. Shitago's shi "To the Maidenflower," discussed above, is also among the many poems to which the script of the play makes allusion. For a text of the play, with brief commentary, see Sanari Kentar6 PltA ,, ed., YJkyoku taikan (Meiji shoin, 1964) 5.3487-502. 75 The phrase somoku kokudo shikkaijobutsu ?*+ )iZ{ts is a formulaic exposition of the notion that the buddha-nature is inherent in all things, including non-sentient beings and inanimate entities. In the Ominaeshi monogatari usage, the narrator links "grasses and trees" and the image of the "seed" of Buddhahood (jobutsu no tane) to the horticultural context set by the ominaeshi theme. 76 Sat6, ed., Ominaeshi monogatari, pp. 121-122.</page><page sequence="41">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 429 As telling as this Tokugawa-era reading of the poem is (about Tokugawa, not Heian, values), one wonders: is this what Izumi Shikibu really had in mind, even if it was indeed she who wrote the verse we encounter in this setting? Or should we view this story, as the Ominaeshi monogatari author (or, its narrator) suggests, as one ver- sion of a legend concocted after her time, a kind of engi, a tale about the origin of an institutionalized religious practice-in this case, the offering by women of ominaeshi to serve as surrogate female presences at Hie nenbutsu rites? If such a custom of floral surrogacy did exist, it would seem to represent a concretization of the poetic flower/woman trope, an ultimate elevation, or transformation, of a game of words into the very matter of religious rite. And there does seem to be corroborating evidence for such a practice, in the form of another poem/story presented in the personal anthology of Fujiwara Mototoshi MWAR (1060-1142): aru onna, hachigatsu futai no nenbutsu ni ominaeshi o tatematsuru to te, uta koihaberishikaba, kawarite iitsukawashikeru wa ga gotoku itsutsu no sawari aru hana o ikaga hachisu no mi to wa nasubeki77 A certain woman wanted to send maidenflowers as an offering for the "non-stop nenbutsu" in the eighth month, and asked him for a poem to send along with them, so he wrote in her place: Is there some way for this flower which, like me, faces the Five Obstructions, to be made into a being who can be born anew upon the lotus? Far more successfully than the fictional Kaoru, Mototoshi manages to see things as the woman for whom he is writing the poem may see them. Thus, he asks, can this flower-substitute really achieve that which is in fact my (i.e., the woman's) goal, a metamorphosis analo- gous to and as miraculous as that realized by the Dragon-girl before the eyes of a vast assembly of doubting males? And, if the scenario sketched by the kotobagaki is to be believed, should we not also view this offering of the surrogate-the flower for the woman (who also 77 Mototoshi shui 1 15; SKT 3.470.</page><page sequence="42">430 EDWARD KAMENS gets a male to serve as surrogate poet)-as a sincere attempt to pene- trate, through language, the misogynistic barriers that kept women like this one out of Enryakuji (and which barred them from certain other religious precincts, too)? On this occasion, it would then ap- pear, Mototoshi puts all joking aside: the flower's masquerade as woman is performed again, but this time the woman who sets the stage, and the poet who writes the script, mean business. She can- not go to Hieizan, but she can offer the flower, and the poem, and hope that having done so will somehow ease her way hereafter. In this relatively serious skirmish in an ongoing game, the poet still en- gages with the playful past precedents that shape the ominaeshi trope, but, like Izumi Shikibu's even more challenging barb, the resulting text itself becomes part of the ritual offering, intended to accrue to the woman's merit in a world where there is, apparently, not much else that she can give or do. Thus, like the offerings of honor and awe inscribed in njijhappon no uta through manipulations of the es- teemed Lotus text, Mototoshi's poem manipulates its own setting in an effort to transform a scenario of limitation into a drama of libera- tion. NUMBER GAMES: DEEP PLAY The poems discussed in the preceding section might be described as a variety of conjunctions of conventions. Each time the itsutsu no sawari topos met and combined with the traditional treatment of the ominaeshi as female emblem, the old became new, the familiar was recast. Thus, the conventional aural play that repeatedly forces ominaeshi to stand for omina links all these poems to one another, so that each seems to be a variant of all the rest-yet each one is dis- tinct, each one a unique exercise of some of the potential moves available to each poet-player in an on-going game. Some of the foregoing poems may also seem to be odd mixtures of the serious and the light. Henjo's witty burlesques and Izumi Shikibu's bravura displays wilfully turn sobriety into satire, and scenarios that involve seemingly serious matters (Buddhist clerical misogyny, nyonin kinsei, and the negative view of women that sup- ports these practices) are treated as jokes. Mototoshi engages in analogous play, but his product is presented as part and parcel of a</page><page sequence="43">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 431 ritual gift. To a certain extent, this seeming clash of moods may be due to the fact that these matters are being treated in waka, a venue in which clever, adroit play with words (kotoba) is highly valued; but, of course, so is meaning and content (kokoro). So, when playful- ness of this kind functions (paradoxically) as a means for addressing matters of considerable weight (i.e., the realities of women's religi- ous experience), then it seems likely that such play itself matters, that in calling attention to itself it also calls our attention to the "real" human dramas that it mimics in words. Perhaps what we also see here are the workings of what might fair- ly be termed a waka pragmatics. Various settings and occasions bring the five obstructions topos to the fore; the poet, moved by these circumstances to compose, confronts the topos with such means as are at her or his disposal-means which are limited by precedent but which nevertheless provide more than ample resource for new text-making. Inevitably, an element or elements of each new poem will resemble those of one or several other poems, yet each will also be a distinct creation, one particular poet's particular arrangement of the materials at hand into unique shapes. To write such waka, then, is to engage in a kind of meaningful play, with words, senti- ments, and ideas; it is an act inherently serious and light, and its most effective products may be those that find a middle ground be- tween the two. There is a striking kind of serious play that gives meaningful structure to several additional itsutsu no sawari poems: in these, the key element in play is the number of the obstructions (five) itself, balanced against a variety of other integers (one, two, six, ten). Superficially, the function of the numbers in such poems appears to be that of number qua number: the significance of the "content" of itsutsu no sawari (and of the various numerical sets against which it is posed) is somewhat suppressed but not wholly effaced, so that the numerical phrases work as structural poetic language as much as and at the same time that they signify doctrinal conceptions. Thus, text, pre-text, and sub-text become inseparable, indistinguishable, and poems that appear to be mere manipulations of numerical schemes insist on closer scrutiny.78 78 Such numerical play is certainly not limited to itsutsu no sawari treatments; it occurs wide-</page><page sequence="44">432 EDWARD KAMENS In Hjbatsushu t.Vt., a miscellany of Buddhist texts and tales com- piled late in the twelfth century by Taira Yasuyori l)*, that ir- repressible games mistress Izumi Shikibu is credited with the follow- ing: futatsu naku mitsu naki nori o kikitsureba itsutsu no sawari araji to zo omou Since I have heard this unique Dharma (of which there are no two or three) I know those five obstructions will not obstruct me.79 Yasuyori presents this poem as one of several examples of many composed as restatements of key passages in the Lotus Sutra: the im- plied textual references in this particular verse are, of course, to the Dragon-girl episode in "Devadatta" and also to the sutra's repeat- ed insistence that there is only one Dharma (it ho, nori [i.e., nori) or "Vehicle" (*jo, also nori, [i.e., nnri]). The poem's rhetoric is strik- ingly similar to that of Senshi's Hosshin wakashul "Devadatta" verse (tameshi arikereba . . . kumo mo araji to zo omou), for both poems con- sist of a definite conditional clause followed by one of emphatic nega- ly in waka. In his landmark study of the impact of Chinese Six Dynasties poetry on Japanese poetry of the ninth and tenth centuries, KonishiJin'ichi IJ#9iW- draws an analogy between what he calls the "numerical conceit" (sujiteki hasso RT-9Jt) in waka (for which his exam- ple is KKS 257) and the "taste for figures" [i.e., for numbers] (keisan shinri ni motozuku kyomi r-A-:5 &lt; OK) apparent in the " 'number poems' [poems incorporating numbers]" of Bao Zhao ff (414?-466. Konishi cites no particular "numerical" examples by Bao Zhao, but perhaps he refers to that poet's riddle poems, "Shuo ming shi" Rt3 and "Zimi sanshou" T A -. See Lu Qinli AAA, ed., Xian Qin Han Weijin Nanbeichao shi. 3 vols. [Beijing: Zhonghua Shuji, 1983], 2.1300,1322). In general, Konishi is rather dismissive of such practices, which he treats as part of a "tendency" shared by both the Six Dynasties and Heian poets "to indulge in word play" and to substitute the manipulation of form for the expression of genuine feeling-tendencies which, in his view, worked to the detriment of the art of poetry in both traditions. (See Konishi, "Kokinteki hy6gen no seiritsu," reprinted in Nihon bungaku kenkyui shiry6 kank6kai, ed., Kokin wakashul, p. 162; and Konishi and Helen C. McCullough, trans., "The Genesis of the Kokinshui Style" in HJAS 38 (1978): 106-7.) What is missing from Konishi's study, which first appeared in 1949, is evidence of a willing- ness to consider the possibility that an interest in form per se need not be frivolous, or recogni- tion of the idea that form may be significant in and of itself. 79 Yoshida K6ichi EI and Koizumi Hiroshi 1J'\7%1, eds., Hibutsushui (kyusatsu bon).

Its first words,"futatsu naku mitsu naki nori o" -"the Dharma that is neither two nor three [but just one]" -are also a near-perfect replication of lines in the middle of a poem (on the "Parables" [Hobenbon uI5Rr.] chapter of the Lotus) from the early eleventh-century ndijhappon no uta series by Akazome Emon: tokiokade irinamashikaba futatsu naku mitsu naki nori o tare hiromemashi If the Buddha had not bequeathed it before he died, who, then, could spread this Dharma of which there are no two or three?8' Clearly, Izumi Shikibu (or whoever wrote the Hobutsushul verse) was by no means the first to do honor to specific passages of the sutra text through playful numerical manipulation of its words within a contrived hypothetical ("if/then") setting. Thus legitimated in prax- is, this particular number game could be freely replicated, to similar effect: like the cloud/obstruction (kumo/sawari) trope, its place in the waka repertoire was secured simply through repeated use, and its en- coded meaning could be invoked at will. In the fifth of the five poems in the Shakkyo section of her contri- bution to the Kyuzan hyakushu (discussed above), Horikawa's sister Josaimon'in Hy6e L AmR}11Y put both the "not two, just one (Dharma)" formula and the cloud/barrier trope into play: 80 The use of the conditional as fulcrum is by no means unique to Lotus-devotional verse, or to waka of any particular stripe or period: indeed, it recurs everywhere, perhaps because the inherent mechanics of the tanka form (thirty-one syllables in a succession of five groups, 5-7-5-7-7) make such positings of conditions in one part of a poem (usually the "upper" two or three ku) and announcements of quasi-logical conclusions in the other a natural pat- tern, and also because of a tendency to mimic the reasoning mode that is so prominent in the rhetoric of Six Dynasties poetry. On the latter point, see Konishi, op. cit., and Helen Craig McCullough, Brocade by Night: Kokin wakashui and the Court Style in Japanese Classical Poetry (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1985), pp. 68-71. 81 Sekine Yoshiko *W , Abe Toshiko , Hayashi Mariya t#-' 9 V, Kita- mura Kyoko VtNT, and Tanaka Ky6ko ; eds., Akazome Emon shui zenshaku.

If Hyoe's ShakkyJka sequence adheres to the pattern followed by several other Kyuian hyakushu contributors, this last poem in the group can be read (even if not labeled as such) as one "on the kokoro of the Nirvana Sutra" (Nehangyo NAM), in which case the matched ac- tions of "lifting away" and "clearing" (kakehanaru, kumo haru) take on added significance, as renderings of the final separation and clarification, the resolution into a void, which is the fundamental subject of the Nirvadna narrative.83 Furthermore, the construction of the poem around the play of two (or "not-two, futatsu naki) against five is a deft juxtaposition which, by shifting both the contextual and the intertextual focus, suggests a new reading of the hoped-for clearing of the clouds as nehan (extinction, cessation) rather than o6JJ (,4, rebirth in Amida's Pure Land). But, says Hyoe, if this teach- ing (nori) is not "met with" (awazu to), neither she (nor any woman like her) will see those five clouds breaking up: rather, they will con- tinue to befuddle and befog her life, imposing barriers where a clear view should be revealed. Once again, the framing of a negative hypothesis shapes the poem and creates a roundabout logic: for, after all, the unique Dharma does exist and can be "met with," so chances are good that the clouds will clear. Still, the negative hypothetical poses a dire prospect: what will happen if, indeed, the Dharma cannot be "met with"? And if, because of special han- dicaps or exclusionary practices, women have only limited access to that Dharma, is this not perhaps a real, rather than a rhetorical, con- cern for them? 82 SKT 4.295, poem no. 1190. 83 In Fuboku wakash ; a compendium of over 17,000 poems "left out" of the chokusenshui, compiled by Fujiwara Nagakiyo oW.AMN from the papers of Reizei Tameyo (i- 7A 1263-1328), this poem ( no. 16269) is labeled as one on Nehangy5 no kokoro.

See SKT 2.835.</page><page sequence="47">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 435 The same kind of question is posed by some men. In Tadamichi shui E R, a collection of the verse of Fujiwara (Hosshoji nyud6 saki no kanpaku) Tadamichi &amp;A ~AIJItA,A&gt; (1097-1164), we find a poem, presented as one from a nijuhappon no uta set, that com- bines another set of numbers at play within a "hypothesis contrary to fact" (hanjitsu kaso F_RTIRV, as in Hy6e's poem). The textual topic inscribed as kotobagaki is another much-favored "Devadatta" pas- sage, the point at which the Dragon-girl rhetorically challenges the male assembly with her own description of what she has done: ware hoju o tatematsuru ni, Seson wa noju shitamou84 "I offered a precious gem, and the World-honored One ac- cepted it. [Was this quick or not?]"85 namima yori hitotsu no tama o sasagezu wa ikade gosh6 no kumo no haremashi86 Had she not offered up that single jewel from amidst the waves how, then, could those five obstructing clouds have been swept away? Here is a rare use (in poetry) of the on'yomi ("Chinese reading") gosho instead of itsutsu no sawari. (Even if Kaoru or the Genji author thought it best to eschew the Chinese, Tadamichi seems to have had no problem with it.) Against it, Tadamichi poses the single jewel (hitotsu no tama). The play of numbers here embodies Tadamichi's poetic interpretation of the passage: he suggests that it was the offering of the single jewel that made the clouds disappear. A fuller gloss might explain that, had the girl not cultivated the reverence for the Buddha that prompted her to perform this act, she could not have achieved her transformation. But Tadamichi's numerical rhet- oric creates its own quasi-logic, and, imbedded within a familiar 84 T 9: 35c; Sakamoto and Iwamoto, Hokekyo 2: 222. 85 Hurvitz, Scripture of the Lotus Blossom, p. 201. 86 SKT 3.489, poem no. 179. An anonymous interlinear commentator, who provides exten- sive glosses on selected poems in the collection, says of this one: "Everyone knows what this is about, so I shall write nothing more (hito mina shiroshimesu koto nareba, kakazu).

And again, the hypothesis (which can also be read as one proposed by the girl herself: "Had I not offered the jewel . . . ") is a troubling one: what, indeed, would have been her fate had she not done this thing? She would not then have become a man and then a Buddha in her "Spotless World-Sphere"; rather, she would have grown into an adult female dragon and would have suffered all the ills of her sex and of her sub-human species as well. But she did give the jewel, and Tadamichi implies that all women should do likewise if they seek an analogous change. There are, as we know, other prescriptions and formulae given particularly for women's sake. One of these is the eighth of the "twelve great vows" (juni taigan t+ zi) of Yakushi nyorai (ANiAP X, Tathagata Bhaisajya-guru): in a world in the distant past, he promised that all women would be changed into men so that they could attain Buddhahood with him (tennyo tokubutsu *Xf).87 In Shoku kokin wakashui, a poem (no. 803) by Shosanmi (Fujiwara) Tomoie (GE-L f:, ?-1258), on the topic "Yakushi nyorai," uses number play to remind women of the force of this vow. Its effects are shown to be still applicable, for, by replicating Yakushi's vow- making voice, the poet carries that voice forward to the present: chikai areba itsutsu no sawari aratamete mutsu no michi o ya yukiwakarenan88 Because of this vow, the five obstructions will be transformed and you will surely pass out of the Ways of the Six Realms. Tomoie praises Yakushi's benevolence in insuring the requisite gen- der change: he nullifies "the five" (gosho) and thus grants release from "the six" (rokudJ AA, the six lower states of existence, includ- ing the state of being a human woman) through mathematical al- chemy (aratamete suggests that the five obstructions will be reor- ganized as a positive force that will free the woman from the "six Ways"). Again, the rhetoric of the poem implies that had Yakushi 87 Yakushi nyorai hongangyo i1I4J**JMA (Tno. 449) is one of several sutras in which the vows are enunciated.

But he did, and Tomoie, while engaging in yet another number game, urges women to be grateful, and to seek comparable routes of escape. The most promising route of escape for medieval Japanese wom- en was through the taking of vows and becoming a Buddhist nun. Women did so in all manner of circumstances, but always with the understanding that the act itself would have a powerful effect on their present lives (to a greater or lesser degree, it changed their mo- dus vivendi) and in the belief that nothing else could have so positive an effect on their future as well. Shukke MS (the abandonment of worldly ties) and jukai i (the taking of vows) were points of depar- ture, and a woman's passage from lay status to that of a nun was marked in several ways-with a change of attire and of hair-style, sometimes a change of abode, and perhaps of comportment as well. The departure and change were also often commemorated in verse, most frequently by the new nun's relatives, friends or other observ- ers (those "left behind' 89), and sometimes by the male priest respon- sible for the conferring of the vows. Such a poem, presented in Shin- chokusen wakashuz VTOMMM (no. 578) as having been composed when the Tendai prelate Kanshui S (945-1008) conferred vows upon a nun, commemorates the moment of change with another ver- sion of itsutsu no sawari number play: nengoro ni t6 no imashime uketsureba itsutsu no sawari araji to zo omou Since you have undertaken these ten vows in deep sincerity, I am sure that the five obstructions will not obstruct you." We have seen the conditional rhetoric (nengoro ni . . . uketsureba . . . sawari araji to zo omou) before, and might note that this is ostensibly the earliest of the poems in which we have seen it in use in this par- ticular topical setting.9" In this case the number play is between the 8 For exchanges between Daisaiin Senshi and two new nuns-one, a former protegee, the other a retired Empress-see Kamens, Buddhist Poetry, pp. 45-46 and 55-56. The figural schemes of both poems emphasize the new nuns' removal from their former secular sphere and from the peers who remain there. 90 SKT 1.27 1. 91 Fujiwara Teika *X(t* compiled Shinchokusen wakashui, the ninth imperial anthology,</page><page sequence="50">438 EDWARD KAMENS novice nun's ten initial vows (to no imashime, i.e., jikkai t+.) and the five obstructions which, Kanshui says, they cause to fly away. Once more, the implication is that this would not have been so had the woman not taken the vows, and had she not done so in deep sinceri- ty (nengoro ni). The five have been countered by the ten, making resolution possible-but had this not happened, Kanshui suggests, the woman might still be facing a far less promising future. There are of course many other kinds of play besides the numeri- cal in waka's rhetorical repertoire. One very common game is the posing of questions with obvious-and sometimes not so obvious- answers. Tomoie combines this speculative mode with a bit of num- ber play in a poem (no. 16553 in Fuboku wakasho6) on the topic "ama J,' ("the nun"): hitosuji ni itsutsu no sawari itoiteya omoisutete mo michi ni iruran92 Is it because she so single-mindedly wishes to circumvent the five obstructions that she has forsaken everything to enter the Way? Well, of course that is why-but the poem goes through the motions of asking the question anyway. Tomoie addresses the generic topos (no one nun in particular but rather an idealized "nun" about whom scores of poems have been written before) by asking (know- ingly) whether or not it is the nun's single-minded determination (hitosuji ni, literally "on one straight course") to find a detour around the five obstructions that has driven her to take this radical step (omoisutete mo, "going so far as to put all else aside"). If so, this is all very much to her credit: the imagined nun's clarity of purpose and her willingness to unravel her former ties bespeak sincerity, and, in Tomoie's perception of her state of mind, her need to "get around" the obstacles explains everything she does. Thus, Tomoie uses number play not only to decorate his verse but to pay tribute to an ideal woman's religious drive. His touch is light and heavy at the same time: the number play is offset by the drama of the woman's in the 1230s, over two hundred years after Kanshiu's death. 92 SKT 2.840.</page><page sequence="51">TRANSFORMATON OF A WAKA TOPOS 439 strategic maneuver around the obstacles and her abandonment of her former ties. But this balance fits the competing demands of the conventionalized compositional circumstance, which calls for the display of literate dexterity, and the inherent gravity of the topos, which here inspires Tomoie to enact admiration and awe. OF WOMEN AND MEN The origin of the five obstructions topos lies in a deprecatory view of women-a male view, imposed on women when they sought to par- ticipate and share in discourses controlled by men (the various dis- courses of Buddhist devotion and the discourses of waka as well). Each exercise of that topos (no matter what form that exercise takes) contends with that view, even where poetic sensibility goes a long way toward muting its force. Indeed, in some exercises the poetic treatment of the topos actually magnifies the original idea's sig- nificance. Still, with the possible exception of Izumi Shikibu's Shin senzai wakashui maidenflower verse (if read as pungent satire), we do not find women poets protesting or resisting the five obstructions idea when they address this topos; rather, they recognize its pres- ence and then try to find ways to set it aside or to move beyond it. Some men do likewise, but even in some of their attempts at en- couragement or sympathetic treatment they still reveal a depreca- tory attitude (not unlike the fictional Kaoru's). For example, the rhetoric of a celebration of the Dragon-girl's metamorphosis (Ryu- nyo jJbutsu o yomeru d*kfL -AJ tb 6) by the K6fukuji monk Shocho , (1067-?) evinces an awe that is tinged with skepticism: watatsuumi no soko no mokuzu to mishi mono o ikade ka sora no tsuki to naruran93 While I have viewed it as one views useless weed from the bot- tom of the sea, 9 The poem is included in some versions of Kin 'yJ wakashiu, the fifth chokusenshiu, compiled 1124-26.

Like Jien, who would later marvel at and share in the joy of the Dragon-girl's transformation from scaly (female) sea-creature (iro- kuzu) to (non-female) Buddhahood, Shoch6 is amazed that "useless sea grass" (mokuzu, i.e., the Dragon-girl) of the sort that washes up from beneath the waves (and must be sorted out from among the more valuable, edible seaweeds) could become a radiant moon (i.e., a Buddha) which then sheds its light on those below. Like many others, Sh6cho emphasizes the imponderable gap, so quickly crossed, between the Dragon-girl's original state (at the sea-bottom) and her (lofty) Buddhahood. No doubt his objective-like that of the sutra's account of the episode-is to praise the sutra and its pow- er. But the negative (the girl's original inferior state) gets as much attention in the poem as does the affirmative (the wondrous work that the sutra can do). And, as usual, Sh6ch6 implies that without the wondrous power of the Lotus the girl would of course have remained in her sorry, worthless state. Similarly, the Priest-Prince Son'en (Son'en Hoshinno 4P3iLMA, 1298-1356)-sixth son of Emperor Fushimi, several times Tendai zasu (and founder of a great calligraphic school, the Shoren'in- ryu 1R , later called Oie-ryui (rlS) expresses doubt when he reaches the "Devadatta" stage of a one hundred verse sequence of poems based on quotations from the Lotus (Hokekyo hyakushu i A). His topic text for this poem is the doubting question posed by Sariputra, immediately after listing the five obstructions: "How can the body of a woman speedily achieve Buddhahood?"94 (ikanzo, nyoshin, sumiyaka nijobutsu suru koto o en aki fukaki tsuyu ni shioruru ominaeshi ikade hirakeshi satori naruran96 How can the maidenflower withering in deep autumn dew experience the enlightenment that has opened up for her? 9 Hurvitz, Scripture of the Lotus Blossom, p. 201. 95 T 9. 35c; Sakamoto and Iwamoto, Hokekyo 2.222. 96 Yanase Kazuo j ed., Son 'en Hoshinno: Hokekyo hyakushu, Hokekyo waka.

His hyakushu follows a conventional sequence: these hun- dred poems celebrate Lotus texts under the standard topical rubrics, beginning with spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and proceed- ing on to "love," "miscellaneous," and "religious rites" (jingi). This format sets up intriguing juxtapositions-of the sacred and the secular, as it were-and Son'en takes advantage of the potential presented by such a multi-contextual construct (a staged interaction between "Shakkyoka" and "non-ShakkyJka" praxes, yielding a hybrid praxis.) The ominaeshi in this poem is doubly autumn's em- blem and a stand-in for the Dragon-girl. She withers in deep au- tumn dew; she suffers in her sorry state. How can she be saved? How can her "shriveling" (shioruru) be replaced by an "opening up" (hirakeshi satori)? Surely, through the power of the sutra alone. Son'en praises it, once more: but in doing so he stands with Sariputra, and shares his doubting voice. They both act as foils whose negativism exists only to be shown wrong, but, by recapitulat- ing Sariputra's words, Son'en brings the doubt they embody to the fore, and the debate is, at least rhetorically, opened again: was the Dragon-girl a special case, a rare exception? She carried out a mira- cle: can other women do so, too? Some men, writing on behalf of women, are quite sure that they can. One is Fujiwara Teika (1162-1241). In 1194, on the first an- niversary of his mother's death (he tells us in Shuii guso iUl A, his collected works) he made six copies of the Lotus Siitra as a memorial offering, and on the frontispieces of each of the eight fascicles of one copy he inscribed a poem.97 For the fifth fascicle, containing the Devadatta chapter and the story of the dragon-king's daughter, he wrote: ominaeshi ukekeru tama no ato shi areba kieshi uwaba ni tsuyu na midare so98 9 Teika's mother, known by the appellation Bifukumon'in Kaga #'Mr1fl1u, died on the thirteenth day of the second month of Kenkyiu 4 (1193); Teika was thirty-two years old at the time.

As usual, Teika works with the materials that just about everyone else does, but does it all differently. He recapitulates the offertory act of many another earlier mourner, but does so in the language and style of his own time, making the old new in his idiosyncratic way. The maidenflower in this poem is the dragon girl's direct descendant and beneficiary of her giving of the jewel; proxy for all womankind, the flower is also the intermediary through whom the Dragon-girl's exemplary achievement is transmitted and replicated, enabling all other females to accomplish similar deeds and to ex- perience a similar change. In Jien's ominaeshi poem ("yuizuku yo . . . "), the dew on the flower, its worldly taint, evaporated (kiyu) as a sign of its attainment of purity. Here, what has disappeared into air is the departed mother herself, the once-sheltering leaves (kieshi uwaba). The word tsuyu, dew, is not only a conventional part of the autumnal word-picture (linked to the flower and to the act of disappearing [kiyu]) but also adverbial, and part of a prayer: "let there not be the least disturbance."99 In this memorial poem inscribed on a memorial copy of the Lotus-where the pragmatics of waka meet the pragmatics of death and of prayer for the dead once more-Teika manipulates almost every conceivable nuance of the topos offered by the text and of almost every word he uses, but through all the complexity comes a simple message: "May my mother now, at least, be free from the suffering she knew in this world." Her departed presence now, more than ever, deserves her son's assurance of the same rewards as those won so instantaneously by the Dragon-girl, despite the doubts of all those males who stood there watching her. 9 Teika's flexible syntax may yield another meaning as well, as an anonymous reader for the HJAS has suggested: "let me not disturb this peace with my tears (tsuyu)."</page></plain_text>
