The vast Universe sleeps, where cradled Eternity watches. Osip Mandelstam1 In his book, The Listening Composer, George Perle characterizes a child hood hearing of the Etude in F minor from the Trois Nouvelles Etudes of Chopin as his first "coherent, integrated" musical experience. His encounter was "so intense, so startling, as to induce a traumatic change of conscious ness." He feels he must have "understood" this music, must have been able to "follow" it. He then poses the question, "What is it that we 'follow' in a piece of music, what is it that gives it coherence and direction and sense?"2 In this paper, I would like to pose a slightly different, although related, query of this experience: that is, not what did Perle "follow," but what did he understand? In posing this query, I am hoping to return to some basic questions of musical analysis and its purpose. Osip Mandelstam, "Octets," tr. Donald Davie, Agenda 14 (1976).

Although brief, it has a complex surface. Since he remembers the experience vividly, we must assume that a significant affective response animated his understanding. His choice of words - "coherent," "integrated" - suggests a formative grasping, a continuous and perhaps unconscious structural apperception. He made, as we might say, a deep connection to the piece. What might this have been? For some years, I offered a graduate course which I called simply "Great Moments." The purpose of this course was to examine situations in tonal mu sic which we all could agree to be extraordinary (eg. the beginning of the "Dissonant" Quartet of Mozart), to discuss what made these moments some how special, and to arrive at ways to describe this specialness. I hoped to en courage students to develop their own ways of writing about music; to con sider analysis as an expressive hermeneutic act, growing out of the listening experience of the work, and to see the limitations of conforming to one or two strait-jacketing applicatory techniques. It was an attempt to counteract these rigid approaches by seeking "a new science for every object," rather than a universal panacea.3 When I asked the students to bring examples of moments they found "great," it became obvious that we could not always agree upon the "greatness" of a moment.4 Evidently some passages in music were "great" for some people and not for others. We considered that those experiences we as sociated with "greatness" might fall into the two categories of individual and universal. From the standpoint of the psychologist C.G. Jung, we contrasted an accessing of a personal and a collective unconscious. The personal (explored by Freud) contains forgotten or repressed events and feelings from our own lives, subliminal perceptions, and contents not yet ready to become conscious. The collective unconscious, on the other hand, is an archetypal background common to us all; as such it is impersonal and does not owe its existence to individual experience, although it is experienced individually. In my course, the students discovered that they might have a strong affective response to a piece or passage which the rest of us considered unremarkable. This projection of personal content, which evidently was evoked by the temporary psychic state of the individual, might urge the listener to repeated hearings of the piece, until this emotional response was exhausted, and the work thereby lost Roland Barthes. cited in Italo Calvino, Six Memos for the Next Millennium (Cam bridge: Harvard University Press, 1988), 65. For our purposes we defined "great" rather loosely as "deeply impressive" or "pro foundly moving." Along with Edward T. Cone, we considered that "judgment of final excellence must be fundamentally intuitive." Edward T. Cone, "Analysis Today," in Music: A View from Delft, ed. Robert P.

With the situations we all agreed were "great moments," however, this numinous quality survived independent of transitory psychic states. Rather, understanding deepened. These situations, we postulated, evoked somehow the collective unconscious - that is, in Jung's terms, they had an archetypal significance and moved beyond the personal concerns of the ego to a widened consciousness of universality. It is this arche typal connection which I believe many of us would like to express with our analytical interpretations, but sadly, it is just this element which is often sacri ficed to the interests of a generalizing scientistic approach. The word "archetype" has been watered down in modern parlance.5 Arche types, Jung postulates, are inherited instinctual tendencies to expression, which inhabit the unconscious realm. In themselves, they are irrepresentable, but their effects are discernable in images. Their expression varies with cul tural background and historical time, as well as with individual creativity. They are a conjunction of image and emotion and so carry an emotive and numinous vital force. That we can recognize the presence of the archetype through its numinous quality is supported by Jung's curiously musical lan guage: The moment when this mythological situation reappears is always characterized by a peculiar emotional intensity; it is as though chords in us were struck that had never re sounded before, or as though forces whose existence we never suspected were unloosed.6 Archetypes may be contained in symbols, with which they share the quality of never being fully understood or conscious.7 Thus, for Jung, the archetype is not merely a constantly recurring theme; rather it is "a piece of life, an image connected with the living individual by the bridge of emotion."8 Thinking for a moment of the musical object as symbol, whose meaning can never be fully apprehended, we must now ask what archetypes are con 5 The word, which means "prime imprinter," dates from classical times. Jung's use of the term resembles Plato's "idea," but differs in that for Jung the archetype is not an abstract concept but a "living organism, endowed with generative force." C.G.

Deprived of the anthropomorphic images of psychic figures (such as the archetype of the "Great Mother" present in a painting of the Virgin Mary by Filippino Lippi, or the trickster figure of fairy tales9 ) repre sented by the characters of art and literature, as well as vocal texts, we dis cover in the formal aspects of absolute music a second category of archetypes called by Jung "archetypes of transformation."10 These archetypal situations and procedures operate as organizing principles: A dark impulse is the ultimate arbiter of the pattern, an unconscious a priori precipitates itself into plastic form. ... Over the whole procedure there seems to reign a dim foreknow ledge not only of the pattern but of its meaning. Image and meaning are identical; and as the first takes shape, so the latter becomes clear. Actually, the pattern needs no interpreta tion: it portrays its own meaning.11 Also in music, the form itself is pregnant with the image of the archetype, and the presence of the archetype gives body to the musical work at an instinc tual level far deeper than that of providing a binding ossiture for a surface thematic organization. In comprehending the value of a musical object, we must not only recognize its formal structure in the perceptual sense but also participate in its archetypal aspect, in what Edward T. Cone has called its "dramatic rhetoric."12 Since the archetypes are not themselves rigid images or ideas but rather inherited possibilities, their realization varies, not only with each individual manifestation, but with each individual perception of that manifestation. We must therefore recognize in the unconscious multiplicity of the archetype the inevitability of diverse and even conflicting expressions and interpretations. As Cone observes: "It may even be an indication of quality for a work to elicit many analyses."13 There is in music indeed, as Mandelstam said of poetry, a "roaming root of multiple meanings."14 9 Jung often has such figures in mind when he considers the creative process; his few remarks on the subject of music reveal his lack of interest. Perhaps as a result, his thoughts upon the nature of archetypal expression tend to focus upon descriptions of stationary images, albeit embedded in a context of unfolding process. 10 Jung, CW 9i, par. 80. 11 Jung, CW 8, par. 402. 12 Edward T.

If we are not to lose the significance of the archetype, it is vital that we maintain the distinction between "inherent significance and interpretative meaning" - that rather than trying to explain the archetype, we allow ourselves to accept the diversity of its offerings.15 It is indeed some thing whose mottled features we can never completely grasp, and which, be cause of the uniqueness of musical expression, we cannot describe fully by non-musical means. Our traditional descriptive language thus fails the preci sion and diversity of the archetype and leaves us with the sense of something lost or unfulfilled. At the crux of the listening process lies the distinction between feeling and emotion. Jung directs us to an understanding of feeling at a non-affective level: What I mean by feeling in contrast to thinking is a judgment of value. ... Feeling so de fined is not an emotion or affect, which is, as the words convey, an involuntary manifesta tion. Feeling as I mean it is a judgment without any of the obvious bodily reactions that characterize an emotion. Like thinking, it is a rational function.16 When we focus on the affective content of music (its sadness, anger, etc.) we generalize, while at the same time we move away from both the specificity of the archetype and its universality. Instead of allowing an inward deepening of the archetype, we trivialize it. We must sense its specific universal value, represented by its numinosity, what Cone terms its "inherent expression."17 It is through this merging of our personal experience with the collectivity of the archetype that listening as well as compositional processes take shape.18 As Ben Shahn has observed: can above all establish as the one thing consistent with their nature is their manifold meaning, their almost limitless wealth of reference, which makes any unilateral for mulation impossible."

Hence, we find that the performance practices of the Verein fur musikalische Privataufführungen and the violinist Rudolf Kolisch preserve the diversity and fullness of the archetype by minimizing the projection of the performer's personal experience onto the musical work.

The universal experience is that private experience which illuminates the private and personal world in which each of us lives the major part of his life. Thus, in art, the symbol which has vast universality may be some figure drawn from the most remote and inward recesses of consciousness; for it is here that we are unique and sovereign and most wholly aware.19 Perle describes his experience of the Chopin piece as "so intense, so star tling, as to induce a traumatic change of consciousness." This is a clear de scription of the archetypal musical experience, in which some basic structural idea of the psyche, recognizable unconsciously even by a child, is represented in the work, articulated by its tonal structure. Thus the connection made with such a structure is both the simple sensation-connection of hearing the surface details, and a deeper, feeling-connection, as the structural archetype is recog nized by the inner psyche, and there is a sudden clarification of self. The idea that music expresses psychic contents is not new20 but has been resurfacing of late in discussions of narrative and drama, as well as in a poign ant essay by Benjamin Boretz.21 Boretz addresses many of the issues with which I am concerned here, including the archetypal: - for the linkage of expression with identity means that the expressive energy needs to be released just so that it can create articulate form - it is built up internally precisely as an articulate-form-creation-needing energy - to fulfill itself by creating palpable realizations shaped and contoured and articulated to return to us, from without, the sense of being, the sense of being something in particular, the sense of being something significant, the sense of being in the world, the sense of being in the world with other beings - and being there, for ourselves, among them, even transparently and invisibly, but still not merely perceiving that they are there.22 Not only may our psychic processes enlighten our musical understanding, but also, reciprocally, in the listening process, articulation equals transforma tion, and thus through receiving the significance of a musical moment, we are Ben Shahn, The Shape of Content (New York: Vintage), 54. For instance, Plato states in the "Timaeus": "And harmony, which has motions akin to the revolutions of our souls, is not regarded by the intelligent votary of the Muses as given by them with a view to irrational pleasure, which is deemed to be the purpose of it in our day, but is meant to correct any discord which may have arisen in the courses of the soul, and to be our ally in bringing her into harmony and agreement with her self. ..."

I he expressive torce, which Boretz later terms "primal energy" [p. 14], is what Jung meant by "psychic energy."23 Jung per ceives psychic energy or libido as energy arising from the collective uncon scious, the realm of the archetypes.24 The creative need to express one's identity, alluded to by Boretz, can be imagined to be the drive of the collective unconscious, through psychic energy, to express itself in the way uniquely possible for each individual. If the "identity-seeking" nature of the psychic energy is unrealized, a loss of value ensues, even if there is a superficial perception of form. It is the differ ence between projection and connection with the archetypal field, through an openness to the value of the psychic energy expressed in the musical work.25 As Cone suggests, it is ... an active participation in the life of the music by following its progress, attentively and imaginatively, through the course of one's own thoughts, and by adapting the tempo and direction of one's own psychic energies to the tempo and direction of the music.26 In Perle's case, his was the psychic energy of the listener, and we must as sume that this process of adapting his psychic energy to that expressed in the piece moved his consciousness to a new level.27 In recent years, Perle has spoken out forcefully concerning certain directions taken by modern music theorists. In his article "Pitch-Class Set Analysis: An Evaluation," originally presented as the annual keynote address of the Society for Music Theory on 28 October 1989, Perle pursues the notion that the pitch class set has universality, indeed more universality than the triad in tonal mu sic, but lacks a meaningful connection to our listening experience:28 Jung considered psychic energy or libido a manifestation of all psychic phenomena and so distinguished it from Freud's concept, which had a predominately sexual meaning. "Libido can never be apprehended except in a definite form; that is to say, it is identi cal with fantasy-images. And we can only release it from the grip of the unconscious by bringing up the corresponding fantasy-images." Jung, CW 7, par. 345. Richard Taruskin adds the important aspect of historical judgment to the question of value in analysis. See Taruskin, "Reply to van den Toom," In Theory Only 10 (1987): 50. Edward T.

Whenever we use the phrase, "I hear it so and so," we are referring to that elusive bond with the piece at the feeling and intuitive levels which is ignored by pitch-class set analysis. This removal from the piece leads pitch-class set analysts to refer to analyses as "solutions" (as though works were somehow problems to be nailed down and solved) rather than expressions of a hearing. This archetypal connection is of course not aimed at by pitch-class set analysis; indeed it is excluded; but it is life-giving, and we miss it. Thus Perle seeks in vain a feeling-connection to Z-relations: I can discover these connections between Z-related collections only by subjecting them to an analytical scrutiny that has nothing whatever to do with my intuitive experience as a listener or as a composer. ... Nor can I find anything in the way the composer unfolds these respective collections that points up a formally significant special relation between them.30 This kind of analysis achieves a generality which, however, fails to be dis criminative. The piece is fed to the analytical harvester and indistinguishable bales are produced. In trying to find a "solution" to the piece, an aiming at lu cidity, such analysts destroy its ambiguity and reduce it to the status of a problem, something to be brought under control by the analysis, and the result is eccentric and impoverished. The attempt to generalize at the surface level wipes out deep reflection. In the background lies the possibility that many analysts opt for a scientistic view (as well as certain "formalized" and reduc tive approaches to Schenkerian analysis) because of a fear of the archetypal structures underlying the musical surface.31 Substitution of scientistic language for imaginative exactitude has led to a decline in the scope and perception of the unique. We fail, so to speak, to look the piece squarely in the face, revealing its physiognomy, and in doing so leave it faceless, its identity shrouded. Therefore, it becomes a problem to be speculated about, and as the face of the musical object is also our face, we struggle to regain an identity sacrificed with the image.32 It is the loss of Perle, "Pitch-Class Set Analysis," 151. Perle, "Pitch-Class Set Analysis," 168-169. Cone has a similar idea. Cf. Cone, Delft, 74. Hillman, Egalitarian Typologies, 52-53.

It is the same feeling which caused the little Chopin etude to come to life for him, and which has animated his musical being ever since. In one major example in his article, Perle points out how previously ac cepted ideas of transposition are subordinated in pitch-class set analysis to the necessity for a universal "explanation" of the work. Transposition might make sense to him, where pitch-class set analysis does not, precisely because trans position is an idea whose value we can sense through its archetypal expression of the repeated patterns in psychic development, in which problematic situa tions not yet assimilated recur in different guises throughout the course of a life.33 Similarly, in transposition, we find a pattern repeated, but presented in the new guise of a different scale degree or pitch level. Adam Phillips, in dis cussing the traumatic aspects of psychological repetition - that what we repeat is what we cannot transform - offers an intriguing view of analytical tech nique: But if, as Freud says, we repeat only what we cannot remember, what is the psychoana lyst or literary theorist doing when he learns a method of analysis that itself involves a re petition of certain skills? A method is only a method because it bears repeating; and yet from a psychoanalytic point of view it is repetition itself that is the problem, that signifies trauma. ... Embarrassed alike by the subtlety and complexity of the work of art and of the patient, can the theorist and the analyst do more than repeat what they already know? Is theory always more of the same, just Where The Tame Things Are?34 Boretz carries this point further: So if I want to know what music expresses, and if I want to know why I think about music, I have to introspect my own experience, my experience of my own needs and my experience of how, and which, and in what way, needs are being fulfilled or engaged in the transaction of musical activity. Primally, I need identity - as much of it as I can amass; for my need for identity is mutually articulated with my terror of annihilation.35 In these packed sentences, several issues with which we are already familiar emerge: the connection between musical expression and inner experience, the fear of annihilation, and the suggestion, through the word "primally," that the need for identity and the deepest aspects of musical meaning are somehow 33 Jung compares this type of repetition to a spiral; we meet the same problems repeat edly in life, but always on a new level. This image suggests conceptually the idea of transposition through the circle of fifths. 34 Adam Phillips, "The Shock of the Old."

Boretz rightly stresses the need for a sense of personal identity, and it is this identity, if we are not to be come composers of the Ouija board, that, together with the collective arche typal impulse, informs the compositional process. If absolute music is an expression of inner experience, we can posit the need for a musical analysis, in order to fulfill, to reflect that experience. In short, we want a living story, not a diagnosis. At the same time, as Jung points out, "the experience of the archetype is frequently guarded as the closest per sonal secret, because it is felt to strike into the very core of one's being."36 In our attempts to protect our deepest and most personal experiences we take ref uge in the "verbal, classifying" approaches that obliterate other more intuitive kinds of knowing.37 To do this is a personal betrayal of the compositional object and of ourselves, and it mummifies the corpse of our original energetic involvement. With this quality of discourse, the numinous aspect of the musi cal object and of our feeling relation are endangered: This emotional whole must be kept in mind and allowed for throughout the whole intel lectual process of interpretation. The risk of losing it is great, because thinking and feeling are so diametrically opposed that thinking abolishes feeling-values and vice versa.38 Like the Jungian analyst, we need to abandon all of our preconceptions and techniques when approaching the uniqueness of the musical object. Although Boretz contends that music and language "both express the same thing ... the whole person, the whole group of people - warped this way, filtered that way," [p. 48], these warps and filters are crucial and labyrinthine. The means of expression is radically different from language, and to try to describe it through language distorts its uniqueness. This uniqueness must be treasured, for it is through this that the archetypes and our wholeness in them, emerge. Music as an expression of process, rather than of static imagery, reflects the whole person in a sui generis way. It was this sense of process, underlain by an archetype of form, articulated by tonal progression, that Perle perhaps ex perienced. When Perle asks himself the question, what was he able to follow in the little Chopin piece, he reasons: Jung, CW 7, par. 119. Shahn, Content, 28. Jung, CW 18, par. 596. In Jung's theory of typology, if thinking is the primary way of approaching the world, feeling is considered to be unconscious or immature. Cf. Jung, CW 6.</page><page sequence="11">International Journal of Musicology 4 ■ 1995 35 What could I have known about "tonality"? Yet I must have "understood" this music. 1 must have been able to "follow" it. And what is it that we "follow" in a piece of music, what is it that gives it coherence and direction and sense, if not, in the largest sense of that term, its "tonality"?39 What would an archetype of tonality be? Or should we say that "tonality" is the vehicle through which the archetypes of "coherence" and "direction" and "sense" are expressed? This second idea would seem to go in the direction of Anthony Storr's suggestion that symmetry, journey, and variation are the un derlying structures of music.40 When applied to the rise to prominence of certain formal structures in the Classical period, this view is supported by history. It was indeed only when instrumental music expanded as an inde pendent genre that primary archetypal significance could move from the im agery of textual language to the structure of underlying forms.41 The relation ship between the dominance of structural archetypes and instrumental music is further documented by the preponderance of vocal music during the prob lematic atonal period, when the question of formal structures vexed not only the composers of the time but later theorists as well. (In this connection, we might view the problems of pitch-class set analysis as arising from a misper ception of the musical object. From a cultural-historical perspective, it is in teresting to consider the development of the twelve-tone method as Schoenberg's search for the lost archetypal significance of formal structure.) The archetypes of process, arising from the non-linear realm of the collec tive unconscious, leap to consciousness in an instant, although they may be played out through time. When applied to music, the concept of process as an archetypal event affirms what we experience as a moving through linear time in which non-linear events occur and converge. This multi-faceted apprehen sion of the course of musical progress is essential in considering the questions raised by the terms "narrative" and "drama."42 The action may be unfolded as Perle, Listening Composer, 3. For an extended discussion of this approach, see Anthony Storr, Music and the Mind (London: HarperCollins, 1993). Charles Rosen points out the significance of this move: "Before the middle of the eighteenth century, public music was, with few exceptions, vocal music tied to the expression of words (at least in theory and most often in fact as well) both religious and operatic. For centuries, of course, there had been pure instrumental music played in public but it consisted either of arrangements of vocal music, introductions to vocal music ... or dance music, which had no prestige whatever." Charles Rosen, Sonata Forms (New York and London: W.W. Norton: 1988), 8. Gregory Karl discusses this distinction in an article, "The Temporal Life of the Musi cal Persona: Implications for Narrative and Dramatic Interpretation," Music Research Forum VI (1991): 42-72. In my view, what Karl defines as narrative and drama both</page><page sequence="12">36 International Journal of Musicology 4 1995 narrative, while drama is perceived and held in the moment. But the move ment, rather than being linear, may be inward towards a deepening of the im age. When Henry V in Shakespeare's play considers his predicament on the eve of battle at Agincourt, what has brought him there is not the result of line arity but the synchronistic mergings of fate. This dramatic moment brings to gether the superficial linearity of the march from Harfleur to Agincourt, with its attendant sufferings, and the non-linear presentation of the task set by the psyche: a coming to kingship through acceptance of his place in life.43 In Henry V, we are assisted in our interpretation by the presence of the hero archetype personified in the character of Henry in much the same way that we are assisted in vocal music by the images of the text. We feel his suffering in this scene, as well as in the gradual dismemberment of the march which pre cedes it, in an identificational way. However, the very fact of the quickening of the archetype in this play means that the feelings we experience are general and collective in nature. In absolute music, where we lack the assistance of characterization, the same connection to the archetypal representations of our own psychic processes occurs, but perhaps at a deeper, more primal level. Jung refers to the developmental push of the psyche as the "individuation process." This process, according to Jung, involves the gradual bringing to awareness of one's unique psychological reality and a differentiating of it from the collective. The goal of the individuation process, consciously pursued, is the development of the individual personality. The procedures of the indi viduation process resemble those underlying musical form. As an example of one such psychic procedure, we might briefly examine the musical implications of the night-sea journey form as outlined by Leo Frobenius, which Jung has called a model for the individuation process.44 (See diagram.) In this model, which follows basically the biblical story of occur in music, but I find his distinction between inner and outer characterizations doubtful, as it conceals the way in which we live out our inner dramas in our outer lives. To fulfill this task, Henry must redefine his relationship to the common man, begun in an immature way with his carousing in Henry IV, Part II, through accepting his re sponsibilities and therefore separateness on the one hand, while, on another level, claiming his fellows as his brothers. Thus he achieves differentiation while ending the childish longings of isolation. At the same time, he faces the question of his limita tions through his relationship to God. It is only through this defining and strengthen ing of his kingship from above and below simultaneously that he gains the strength for the battle to follow. This merging of the linear and the synchronistic moment is what marks this scene in the play as a dramatic arrival point. It is drama, rather than narrative; indeed narrative seems for the moment suspended, in favor of a timeless churning.

During the time spent in the whale, the whale itself jour neys to the East, a sign that transformation is occurring in its belly (in this case, Jonah praying to the Lord). When this process is complete, Jonah is spewed forth from the whale, returning to the conscious world the same per son, but transformed. This model has been used by Jung and Frobenius to de scribe a large variety of mythological and literary subjects. For instance, the stories of Theseus and Peirithous, who descended into the underworld to carry off Persephone or the travels of Homer's Odysseus could be cited. The night sea journey is thus a specific form of hero's journey, sharing aspects with the model animating the story of St. George and the Dragon, another hero myth involving engagement with a fantastic creature.46 45 The Greek term is Këtos, or "sea monster." The King James and New English Bibles, as well as the Hebrew (dag gadol), use "great fish." I use "whale" here for reasons of simplicity not biology. I am grateful to Mark DeVoto for this information. 46 In medieval illustrations, whale and dragon are often combined as a single animal - a fish with wings, breathing fire, and so forth. In the case of Henry V,, these models are combined. Henry, a young recently-crowned king, is swallowed by the whale of war with France. He crosses the sea of the English Channel, and there endures trials of death and suffering corresponding to the time spent in the belly of the whale. The or deal of the battle of Agincourt represents the dragon fight, a move from an heroic passive to an heroic active stance. Following this, he returns to England (the con scious world) transformed. Here the devouring is signified by Henry's decision to in vade France, because with this decision, the tension of the opposites is activated: "So long as consciousness refrains from acting, the opposites will remain dormant in the unconscious. Once they have been activated, the regius fllius - spirit, Logos, Nous - is swallowed up in Physis; i.e., the body and the organs representing it gain mastery over the conscious mind. In the hero myth this state is known as being swallowed up in the belly of the whale or dragon." [Jung, CW 12, par. 440.] At the center of the transformation process, on the evening before Agincourt, Henry must now endure the humiliation of a human defeat to avert a military one. In this process, Henry is isolated, if not in a whale or a casket like Osiris, then in his king ship and in his decision to go to Calais. As Jung comments: "The complete swallow ing up and disappearance of the hero in the belly of the dragon represents the com plete withdrawal of interest from the outer world. The overcoming of the monster from within is the achievement of adaptation to the conditions of the inner world, and the emergence ... of the hero from the monster's belly ... symbolizes the recommence ment of progression." [CW 8, par. 68.] This is a kind of "neurotic loneliness," and in it Henry is incapable of action and thus develops a resigned tolerance of all that goes wrong. But in it he is also protected, and as Marie-Louise von Franz writes, "it can be a stage of incubation which aims at the inner completion of a more real and more definitely shaped conscious personality."</page><page sequence="14">38 International Journal of Musicology 4 1995 Heat and hair WEST EAST Devouring ^ £SE|J Slipping out Opening yT * '• Landins Movement (s£fl j % % \ Diagram: night-sea journey model From these and other examples, we can see that the classical Viennese so nata form follows the general pattern of the night-sea journey. Here, the ex position, with its presentation of the opposites in the form of two contrasting theme groups, corresponds to the opening situation. At the beginning of the development, there is often a striking chord or harmonic change or some other articulation, which might fancifully be compared to the swallowing by the whale. The time spent in the belly of the whale, during which the transforma tion occurs, corresponds to the development section, in which the opposites are explored and merged through a variety of techniques, including fragmen tation, rapid modulation, and combining of material from both theme groups. The recapitulation, in which the original material reappears in its transformed state (that is, essentially the same, but with the deeper meaning of intervening experience, and joined now in a single key), corresponds to the reemergence from the whale's belly of the transformed Jonah. The similarity of this form to the night-sea journey model, and to the numi nous quality thus gained, coincides with the synthesis in sonata form of two and three-part structure. It seems that the tri-partite aspect or the expanded content of the development section itself lends this numinous quality, and it is indeed here that the grim workings of the transformation process intrinsic to the night-sea journey are undertaken. In Jungian terms, transformation may be defined as "a psychic transition in volving regression and temporary 'loss of ego-hood' in order to bring to con [von Franz, An Introduction to the Interpretation of Fairy Tales (Dallas: Spring, 1970), 88-89.] Jung describes the emergence from the belly of the whale (signified in Henry V by the integration of personality shown in the Crispin Day speech) as a bringing together of the opposites and an "awakening to renewed fruitfulness." [Jung, CW 5, par. 449.]</page><page sequence="15">International Journal of Musicology 4 ■ 1995 39 sciousness and fulfill a psychological need hitherto unrecognized."47 This de scribes quite well what happens in a typical development section, in which the thematic material of the exposition is fragmented, explored, and recombined so that its potential is revealed. The end of this transformation is signaled by the recapitulation, in which, as Samuels et al., in writing of psychological transformation, make clear, the "continuity of person and psyche are pre served." That is, through the development process, the exposition material is not permanently altered into something else; rather its significance and iden tity are deepened, and what we hear at the end, while superficially the same as before ("continuity of person and psyche"), brings together the opposites in the realm of the tonic key, made richer through the conscious discovery in the development section of the possibilities inherent in their character. The Etude in F minor of Chopin, while exemplifying Chopin's habit in etudes of working through a single idea, has a small tri-partite structure, and we can find elements of the transformation process in its workings. (See ex ample.) As the piece begins, an eight-measure introduction presents contrast ing triplet and quadruple rhythms. The latter serve to introduce the following thirteen measures (A), which unfold a rising octave transfer in the tonic F mi nor, using thematic material derived from the opening. The arrival on the up per tonic in m. 21, articulated by the rest in the right hand over the continuity of eighths in the left, marks the end of the first thematic presentation. What follows (B) is a passage more transitional than thematic in nature, which, while still derived from the opening material, opposes it by moving immedi ately into a rapidly descending exhalation. This passage leads to the cadence on the dominant minor key of C minor at the beginning of m. 29. The arrival at the minor dominant, articulated once again by the cessation of the triplet rhythm of the upper voice, marks the close of the quasi-exposition. The middle section contains many features common to the classical devel opment section. Here we find thematic fragmentation, increased chromaticism with modulation, and a combining of the rising and falling ideas of the earlier material, which lends the entire section a timeless feeling, reminiscent of childhood. This section elides gradually into a return of the rising introductory and A material culminating in the tonic cadence at m. 57. This arrival point, articu lated by the whole note in the right hand, sustaining past the articulating rests cited earlier, corresponds to the upper register cadence of m. 21. The piece then closes with an octave descent, using the transitional material of mm. 22 47 Andrew Samuels, Bani Shorter and Fred Plaut, A Critical Dictionary of Jungian Analysis (London and New York: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1986), 151.</page><page sequence="16">40 International Journal of Musicology 4 1995 29, winding down with the unaccompanied triplet rhythm that opened the piece.48 If we attempt to amplify this etude through the model of the night-sea jour ney, we find, as might be expected in so short an example, that some passages serve double duty. The initial contrast of triplet and quadruple rhythm is used to mark sections: unaccompanied triplets begin and end the piece, while un adorned eighths articulate the inner sections. The B section beginning at m. 22 opposes the idea of descent to the longer rising octave transfer of mm. 9-21, and so suggests a second theme, completing the initial situation. At the same time, its character is more transitional; in this guise, its descending quality neatly expresses the descent into the belly of the whale/dragon, following an initial period of inflation (A). Although in miniature, we find here the same sense of immersion and emergence that we undergo in sonata form, and we can feel in this developmental passage the dramatic digestive processes of the whale's belly at work. The emergence from the belly of the whale/dragon is gradual, more a crawling out than a spewing forth, occurring over mm. 47-57. These measures, while continuing the chromatic character of the developmen tal section, gradually return to a sense of narrative time, culminating in the thematic material of the first section at the tonic in m. 57. The remaining ma terial contains aspects of both recapitulation and coda, as qualities of the in troduction merge with the B material in the final transformed state. Symbolically, we can postulate the gradual integration of independent ele ments through the dramatic course of the piece. While this process is charac teristic of psychic growth in general, it is especially marked in childhood, when the child struggles to integrate the otherness of the outer world while learning to understand the individuality and separateness of his own mind. Perhaps, owing to the brevity of the piece, its action is more revelatory than developmental. But, as Yvor Winters suggests may be the case in brief poems, here the "process of revelation itself may take on ... a quality profoundly dra matic."49 So we can well imagine that for George Perle, who at the time of this experience was awakening to musical activity, his hearing of this dreamy little piece indeed led to a dramatic new level of awareness, whose impression has remained vivid in his later work. 48 This is consistent with Chopin's tendency in his large sonata forms (Opp. 35, 58, 65) not to recapitulate the first theme in the tonic. 49 Yvor Winters, In Defense of Reason (1937; reprint, Athens and London: Swallow Press/Ohio University Press, 1987), 37.</page><page sequence="17">International Journal of Musicology 4 1995 41 Example: Chopin, Etude in F minor from Trois Nouvelles Etudes TROIS NOUVELLES ETUDES Composée pour la Méthode des Méthodes de Moscheles et Fétis 1839 Quellen: Autograph = Aut; Deutsche Originalausgabe = DA; Französische Originalausgabe = FA; Diplomatisch genauer Nadidrudt des Auto graph*. von Arthur Hedley, London, im Eigenverlag gedruckt « Aut; Alte Gesamtausgabe Breitkopf 6t Hirtel « GA Sources: Autograph = Aut; O ri final German Edition = DA; Original French Edition ■ FA; Diplomatie exact reproduction of the autograph, published by the owner, Arthur Hedley, London ® fiut; Old Complete Edition Brettkopf Cr Hirtel tm CA And&amp;ntino *i p * p * p * k * IM- P *1 P » Aut ursprünglich Agitato, dann in Andantino korrigiert.
