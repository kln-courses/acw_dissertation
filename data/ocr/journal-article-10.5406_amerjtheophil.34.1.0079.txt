(reviewed by  myriam renaud, The university of chicago divinity school) The title of Thomas James’s 2011 In Face of Reality: The Constructive Theology  of Gordon D. Kaufman echoes the title of gordon Kaufman’s 1993 In Face of  Mystery: A Constructive Theology. Kaufman’s theology evolved over his long  career, but mystery became his principal metaphor for god. in substituting reality  for mystery, James signals his central project, which is to argue that Kaufman’s  theology offers an objective god who “really acts in the world” (1).  for James, god’s providential activity is a touchstone of christian theology.  however, he asserts, contemporary science has left little space for god to act.  most theologians have responded by: 1) limiting interaction with scientific find- ings to preserve traditional claims about god’s activity, or 2) “collapsing talk of  god’s activity into a preferred version of modern cosmological theory” (2–3). by  contrast, James finds in Kaufman’s In Face of Mystery, a theology that mediates  between these extremes. it “accepts the modern naturalistic conception of the  world as a unified system of cause and effect” while also seeking to understand  and reconcile god’s activity with scientific evidence (32). much of James’s book  is devoted to evaluating the success of Kaufman’s mediating theology.  based on his study of Kaufman’s corpus, James offers the following interpre- tation. The agent-god of traditional theism acts from beyond the world and  thus from outside of nature; while such a god, Kaufman grants, succeeds in  helping us orient our lives, this god does so at the expense of our relationship  with nature of which we are a part. Kaufman proposes focusing, instead, on the  present as a way “through and around” the seeming incompatibility of nature  and theism. god may be found, according to Kaufman, in the “intelligible con- nections between what we habitually presuppose about our world today and  the logical features of god-talk in Western culture” (162, 77). rooted in our  present context, we can survey the real, “locally observable outcome of natural  and historical processes” and among these, discern “intelligible connections.”  These “intelligible connections” provide us with indications of god’s “quasi- teleological” (nonagential) creative and serendipitous activity (81–82). We can  also discover “the emergence of patterns of order” and of humanizing trajectories  in what has in fact “happened in the course of cosmic, biological, and human  history.” These patterns and trajectories accord “a significant but not dominant  place to human life,” and provide “principles of interpretation which can orient  our perception of, and responses to what is going on around us” (106–7).

According to Kaufman, our imagination assists us in identifying “intelli- gible connections” in “natural and historical processes.” indeed, for Kaufman,  all conceptions of god are imaginative constructs (33). does this undermine  James’s central claim that, for Kaufman, god is objectively real? James argues  that Kaufman treats imagination as an epistemological category, merely deploy- ing it to highlight the constructed nature of human knowledge. As a result,  James maintains, Kaufman’s insistence that god is an imaginative construct  is not tantamount to a denial of  god’s reality. Though one may grant that  Kaufman does not deny god’s reality, he does not affirm it, either. Kaufman  remains consistently agnostic on this question. but because Kaufman’s theology  is compatible with claims about god’s reality, James can legitimately claim that  Kaufman’s model of divine activity need not be construed metaphorically.  based on Kaufman’s commitment to linking real features of the world and  of history to theistic claims, James suggests that Kaufman should be considered  a classical theologian. Theologians categorized as classical have accounted for  god’s activity and have done so without compromising their systematics. While  Augustine and calvin were staunch “defenders of  divine providence,” they,  like Kaufman, ascribed “coherence between talk about god and knowledge  of the world” (11). for James, the manner in which Kaufman understands the  relationship between god and the everyday concerns of human beings has a  “measure of continuity” with barth, whom James regards “as among the great- est of the modern theologians” (5). James defends this purported “continuity”  between Kaufman and barth throughout In Face of Reality, allocating to barth  the role of “witness” to the challenges and difficulties faced by interpreters of  divine activity today” (6).  indeed, James argues that “even in his unabashed modernism, [Kaufman]  is distinctly representative of  classical christian theology” (5–6). James ac- knowledges that this claim will be controversial among those who prize the  modernity of  Kaufman’s approach. no doubt, James’s revised categorization  does run counter to the view held by most of  Kaufman’s interpreters. it also  runs counter to Kaufman’s view of  himself. in his 1996 God—Mystery—  Theology, for example, Kaufman described his work as a contemporary theol- ogy because it is informed by a “thoroughgoing historical consciousness” and  does not claim, as does a classical christian theology, that “its assertions”  AJTP 34_1 text.indd   80 1/11/13   2:36 PM </page> <page sequence="3">  Volume 34, no. 1, January 2013 81 are “directly authorized and uniquely authorized or warranted by divine  revelation” (64).  less controversial is James’s treatment of Kaufman’s career-long interest in  “the viability of the notion of divine agency” (114). by 1993, when he wrote In  Face of Mystery, Kaufman personally eschewed agent-like concepts of god.  for reasons that remain unclear, James turns to Kaufman’s pre-1993 work to  analyze his earlier view that god was both transcendent and agent-like. ever  vested in ensuring that god is related to the practical realities of human life,  Kaufman encouraged “personalizing” beyond-the-world concepts of god by  drawing on metaphors, terms, and concepts from experience and relationships.  eventually, James acknowledges, Kaufman abandoned the “concept of agency  as a model for god’s relation to the world” because “the human experience of  agency” is incompatible with a transcendent divine (124).  James leaves unexplored factors that were more influential on Kaufman’s deci- sion to abandon agency as a model for god—namely, Kaufman’s exposure to  feminist theology, black theology, liberation theology, etc. The critique leveled  by these theologies against “many aspects of traditional patterns of theological  thinking” led Kaufman to conclude that god’s imagination-derived, person-like  attributes are invariably anthropocentric and accorded ontological status. in  addition, Kaufman came to understand the traditional cosmic, absolute ruler,  christian god as responsible for “authorizing and legitimating highly destructive  forms of human activity.” more important to Kaufman than agency’s compatibil- ity with the divine, these factors led him to abandon cosmic and agential models  of god in “favor of a model based on the creative development in history and  human culture as a whole” (In Face of Mystery, x–xi, 272–73).  The austerity of Kaufman’s model of god led some to accuse him of sacrific- ing christology for a “rapprochement between Western theism and naturalism”  (80). Against this claim, James asserts that for Kaufman, “the idea of the Trinity  . . . is not simply a myth . . . but a rather momentous metaphysical claim about  the character of the actual universe under god” (112). still, James concedes  that Kaufman’s metaphorical interpretation of “divine impingement upon the  world” renders most christian doctrines unrecognizable (108, 162). To remedy  this situation, James develops several proposals to integrate, into Kaufman’s  theology, a more robust christology, sidestepping Kaufman’s concerns about  the tight connection between anthropomorphic and anthropocentric concepts  of god.  does James succeed in defending his central claim that Kaufman’s theology  offers a “real” god who “really acts in the world”? because of Kaufman’s sus- tained agnosticism on the question of god’s objective reality, and because of  his insistence that all concepts of god are imaginative constructs, James can,  AJTP 34_1 text.indd   81 1/11/13   2:36 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> 82 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy at best, defend the claim that Kaufman’s theology leaves open the possibility  of an objectively real god in natural and historical processes.  Two of James’s additional claims also rely on Kaufman’s ascribing reality  to god. first, James holds that Kaufman’s theology succeeds in providing a  “mediating alternative” (161). James’s primary test of success is whether his  theology offers an account of god’s real activity in line with scientific findings.  if one grants that Kaufman’s god is “real,” then one can agree with James. how- ever, one will wonder whether it is true that most Western theists, as Kaufman  assumed and James accepts, insist that god–world connections are intelligible  only if  they are “fully consistent with scientific facts” (90)? James does not raise  this key issue. To be fair, James, like any good philosopher, accepts Kaufman’s  base assumptions and analyzes the coherence and consistency of the arguments  that follow.  second, should Kaufman join the ranks of classical theologians, as James  proposes? James’s arguments are unlikely to sway those who conclude oth- erwise. The commitment that Kaufman shares with classical theologians to  a “real” god who “really acts in the world” is too flimsy of a connection to  warrant including him in their ranks.  overall, James’s In Face of Reality is a lucid and satisfying book. one need  not agree with James’s principal arguments to hope that this work will reinvigo- rate study and discussion of Kaufman’s theology. indeed, renewed engagement  with Kaufman’s corpus is overdue and will be a most welcome development.

Thomas howe, regis university) With The Republic of Grace: Augustinian Thoughts for Dark Times, charles  mathewes has given us a timely book that, i imagine, will be so for many times  to come. his purpose throughout is to “offer a primer in the Augustinian- christian vernacular, a language of religious, moral, and political deliberation”  (2). This language and way of understanding reality, mathewes argues, can  provide us with ways of thinking about our own lives in the world as politi- cal and social creatures. The “dark times” to which he refers in the subtitle  have to do with life after 9/11 as citizens in a country that dominates as an  economic and military powerhouse and greatly under the influence of what he  calls “millennial capitalism” (115). such events and trends have the tendency of  dismantling our capacities for hope, a key concept throughout the book, and  AJTP 34_1 text.indd   82 1/11/13   2:36 PM </page> </plain_text>
