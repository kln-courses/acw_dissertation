<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cartesian Bodies ALVIN SNIDER University of Iowa Stephen Gaukroger's recent biography of Rena Descartes opens with a bizarre anecdote about the philosopher, a story in circulation in the eighteenth century and repeated ever since. Descartes, the story goes, traveled around Europe accompanied by a life-sized mechanical doll, named after his natural daughter Francine and fabricated, according to one source, "to show that animals are only machines and have no souls."' This utterly lifelike simulacrum once so terrified the captain of a ship on which Descartes secured passage across the Holland Sea that the mariner threw the monstrous mechanical girl overboard while the great thinker slept below. Such a wildly improbable fiction could only gain ground by encoding, however parodically, a widely shared perception of the meaning of Descartes's iconic presence in modernity: Descartes figures as the prophet not of thinking machines (Thomas Hobbes can better lay claim to that distinction) but of soulless automa- tons outwardly indistinguishable from living beings. Gaukroger offers this anecdote as evidence of the lengths to which enemies of materialism and l'homme-machine of the eighteenth-century philosopher Julien Offray de la Mettrie were prepared to go to dis- credit the despised mechanical philosophy. He finds a similar strain of animosity running through contemporary accounts of Descartes. In- deed, we need not look very far, especially among anglophone philoso- phers and literary critics, to find examples of hostility to Cartesianism.2 1. Stephen Gaukroger, Descartes: An Intellectual Biography (Oxford, 1995), pp. 1-2, 6-8. Gaukroger argues that in the 1630s, Descartes abandoned a naturalistic theory of cogni- tion in favor of a skeptical epistemology but, in outlining a tentative "naturalistic psycho- physiology," anticipates the cognitive science of the twentieth century. 2. Julien Offray de la Mettrie, in L'Homme-Machine (1747), gave wide currency to the idea that "the human body is a machine which winds itself up, a living picture of perpetual motion" (Machine Man and Other Writings, ed. and trans.

Cultural and literary critics denounce the Cartesian mechanization of nature for its drive to exploit a passive and limitlessly productive nature or its technocratic and total- itarian urge to extend the reach of scientific rationality into every corner of society. Regarded as synonymous with the rise of modern philosophy, Descartes bears the onus for relegating women to a realm of physical- ity and affect and for making disembodied consciousness the human essence. In asserting the distinctness of body and mind and treating each as separate orders of being, Descartes presents an inviting target for ma- terialists and idealists alike. Cultural materialist studies of early mod- ern England have generally fallen in line with a critique that emphasizes how the advent of a mechanistic philosophy effected a radical reconcep- tualization of the body as a clock or automaton. Jonathan Sawday reca- pitulates this understanding of Descartes's influence when he writes, "As a machine, the body became objectified; a focus of intense curios- ity, but entirely divorced from the world of the speaking and think- ing subject." Sawday's history of the "culture of dissection"-which turned interiority outward and infused into every form of social, artis- tic, and intellectual life an overwhelming urge to investigate phenom- ena by dismembering them-plots a course that runs from a relatively innocent Renaissance Neoplatonism to the "technological regime of the body." Another study of transactions between scientific and politi- cal regimes in early modernity, John Rogers's The Matter of Revolution, also accentuates the broader cultural effects of the "mechanist devi- talization of animals" wrought by Descartes and his followers. Rogers mourns the passing of the pre-Cartesian paradigm as a "fall" from vi- talism, which a triumphant mechanism drove from the intellectual field in the eighteenth century. Unwinding the political and scientific discourses woven into the fabric of English literature, Rogers claims that a philosophy of "monistic vitalism" had the potential to ground "the free agency of the new, self-authorizing member of the polity known as the 'individual' " but that modern liberalism instead cast its 1996], p. 7). On the clockwork metaphor grounding modernity, see Jacques Lacan ("Freud, Hegel, et la Machine," in Le Siminaire dejacques Lacan, ed. Jacques-Alain Miller [Paris, 1973-], 2:94), who treats the idiom of "having a body" as a bizarre form of speech inherited from Descartes's Le Traiti de l'homme (Treatise on Man): "Feuilletez-le, et contr1lez que ce que Descartes cherche dans l'homme, c'est horloge."

Adjectives such as 'pas- sive' or 'inert' fail to capture the peculiar qualities of matter in its Carte- sian representations. Descartes limned an image of nature that seemed distinctly unnatural to his contemporaries, a rendering of reality both stranger than they supposed and stranger than they could suppose. My goal here is not to place Cartesian theories of self and substance beyond critique but to bring our understanding into dialogue with recent work on seventeenth-century natural philosophy. In his writings, Descartes conducts several thought experiments centered on the difficulty, bor- dering on impossibility, of distinguishing human bodies from humanoid automata, machines from animals. He famously resolves the problem by identifying crucial cognitive differences between automata and human beings based on a proto-Chomskian argument about language and on our capacity to respond appropriately to novel circumstances. In this article I want to pursue the initial difficulty, not its resolution, first by exploring Cartesian thinking about the body in Le TraitW de l'homme (Treatise on Man) (written 1629-33) and La Description du corps humain (Description of the Human Body) (written in 1647-48 when Descartes reworked the Treatise). These lesser known writings-the former aban- doned after Galileo's condemnation, the latter unfinished, and both published posthumously in 1662-64-outline a mechanist physiology that makes understanding "the nature of our body" central to achieving the classical injunction nosce teipsum.4 If Descartes notoriously drew a line 3.

Rogers considers both a domesticated version of vitalism that maintains "the inseparability of body and soul" and a wilder variant that infuses "all material substance with the power of reason and self-motion" (p. 1). 4.

Studies such as Sawday's and Rogers's generally pass over without comment an aspect of mechanism that I find striking: in the process of describing the world, mechanical philosophy attributes properties to it that could belong on either side of the wall traditionally separating art and nature. Matter, on these accounts, evinces a sort of dynamism that owes nothing to sentience but that could very well convince a naive ob- server (e.g., the captain in the anecdote) that automatons could act in a purposive and intelligent manner. The "Cartesian bodies" of my title include not just automatons but also other representations of matter that traverse fixed boundaries: mechanically determined but culturally shaped, they are objects of analysis constituted by disciplines of knowl- edge new to the seventeenth century. The second part of the article pursues the argument onto contigu- ous, although less elevated, terrain, turning to a frequently anthologized poem by Aphra Behn, "On a Juniper-Tree, Cut Down to Make Busks." In Behn's poem we find ourselves surrounded by a phenomenal world infinitely more alive than we might suspect. Behn invests nature with a kind of agency at the same time that she renders the human body in terms both eroticized and mechanistic. A wide range of seventeenth- century texts records the recasting of nature in roles at once mechan- ical and human. The new science provided an explanatory framework that permitted it to explain the motion of iron toward a magnet, for example, by reference both to mechanical principles and to the in- fluence of amorous polarities, of sympathies and antipathies. I want to unsettle intellectual histories that dichotomize the seventeenth century into an anthropomorphic Renaissance naturalism and a mechanist phi- losophy that routinely reduces everything to pipes and pulleys. Behn's poem reveals an unexpected solidarity between human and non- human beings in their daily interaction, in effect imagining an abso- lute alterity in the "person" of a metaphorized tree. It presents us with a counterpart to narratives, such as the one told about Descartes's automaton-daughter, that posit the existence of machines physically identical to human beings but apparently devoid of conscious experi- ence. Behn's poem describes, albeit facetiously, a tree's acquisition and loss of something very like agency, and this work simultaneously participates in and defies mechanist representations of the world. In the 1680s Behn's understanding of the philosophy of "Des Cartes, and some other Moderns" hewed to the line taken by Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle in his popularizing Entretiens sur la pluraliti des mondes (1686), which Behn brought out in English translation in 1688, the year before her death, as A Discovery of New Worlds. Fontenelle has one of</page><page sequence="5">Alvin Snider o Cartesian Bodies 303 his interlocutors, Madame la Marquise, survey the contemporary scene and remark that "Philosophy is become very Mechanical," giving him an opening to expound on the Cartesian disenchantment of the world: "'So very Mechanical,' said I, 'that I am afraid men will quickly be ashamed of it; for some would have the Universe no other thing in Great, than a Watch is in Little.'" Fontenelle's worldly marquise, how- ever, will have none of it, claiming that she derives pleasure and meta- physical consolation from the knowledge "that the course and order of Nature, how ever admirable it appears to be, moves upon Principles and Things that are so very easie and simple."5 Heavenly bodies, natu- ral bodies, and our own human bodies exemplify laws of great beauty and power. Rogers argues that vitalism, in alliance with an emergent liberal feminism, contested theories that stressed the passivity of matter and legitimized the imposition of masculine power on a natural world gendered as female. I hope to show that by ruling out of bounds "ani- mistic" explanations of natural phenomena, the mechanical philoso- phy did not necessarily cast a pall of lifelessness on the phenomenal world. On the contrary, the mechanistic banishment of mind from nature could have the effect of blending animate and inanimate, active and passive, creating a sort of affinity and even fellowship between ourselves and the world. Vitalism and its variants endure, even today, because the notion of a world reducible to physical processes seems incompatible with our experience of life and consciousness. At the close of the seventeenth century, however, mechanism held out a promise of total intelligibility, of grasping the facts of nature within an explana- tory framework that could eliminate imponderable mysteries and fill lacunae in human knowledge. While most accounts of Descartes continue to highlight his impor- tance to the philosophy of mind, recent scholarship has retouched the official portrait by paying close attention to his contributions to natu- ral philosophy. By the later seventeenth century and well into the eigh- teenth, Cartesianism remained a byword for scientific thinking. The contemporary estimation of his claim to renown receives witty for- mulation in Etienne Chauvin's anagram in the Lexicon Philosophicum (1692): "RENATUSCARTESIUS= TUSCISRESNATURAE" (Ren Descartes=you 5.

In the same year, the English translation of Gabriel Daniel's satirical fantasy, Voyage du monde de Descartes, mocks in- discriminate observers who make the label "Cartesian" a universal sign of the new knowledge: "As in Spain the Name of Lutheran is indifferently given to all Hereticks of whatever Sect or Faction, so the Title of Cartesian is attributed to all those that have undertaken to make Refinements in Point of Natural Philosophy."6 Not only did Descartes the rationalist regard organic bodies, as he regarded all of nature, mechanistically, so did Descartes the grandson and great-grandson of physicians and Des- cartes the experimentalist who performed animal dissections and attended autopsies. Sawday, in a novelistic touch, imagines an encoun- ter between Descartes and the painter Rembrandt-whose graphic depictions of corpses and slaughtered animals took him away from his easel and into the street-by the "butchers' stalls, or beneath the city scaffold, or in the anatomy studios of Amsterdam and Leiden."7 Des- cartes considered the application of mechanistic principles to the hu- man body a promising research agenda, and physiological knowledge a means to enhance human life by lessening the mind's dependence on the "disposition" of bodily organs. In 1637 he undertook to write a "compendium of medicine" (CSM, 3:76), and the standard Adam and Tannery edition of his works includes, among other forays in this direc- tion, many pages of anatomical observations.8 A return to the physio- logical writings, one commentator observes, "provides an opportunity to approach Descartes' philosophy anew, working from his own under- standing of what was important in it."' Descartes's descriptions of bodies are bounded entirely by the prin- ciples of matter and motion. He retreats into anthropocentrism only when faced with the problems of human volition and agency. That a self- contained automaton could convincingly mimic human motion pro- vided no more than a momentary diversion for the seventeenth-century connoisseurs who admired or collected such objects. Descartes, how- ever, understood immediately that crucial distinctions hinged on how we construed such phenomena. He envisioned a world in which the 6.

'Material agency' is a phrase adopted from Andrew Pickering, and by it I mean to suggest a continuous transformation of the human into the nonhuman and vice versa. As Pickering shows, we can conceptual- ize nonhuman agency semiotically, in terms of substitution, displace- ment, or movement from one position to another, or performatively, as a field where agents do things such as "intertwine" and collaborate in networks.1'0 To invoke agency in this sense is not to attribute inten- tionality to things, a kind of anthropomorphism or hylozoism. Put sim- ply, the world is filled with things and phenomena that bear down on us in all their materiality, that possess an agency that neither comes from within the human realm nor is reducible to it. What I take from science studies in general are strategies for positioning nonhuman sub- jects at the center of posthumanist textual attention and for imagining a relation between human actors and mechanical nature that escapes the snares of representationalism and dualism. For all of its alleged influence as official doctrine, Cartesian dualism has been subjected to many scathing critiques since its inception, par- ticularly during the past fifty years. Gilbert Ryle's classic dismantling of the myth of "the ghost in the machine" treats Descartes's error as a disastrous consequence of his endorsing the "claims of mechanics" with- out accepting, as Hobbes did, "the discouraging rider to those claims, namely that human nature differs only in degree of complexity from clockwork."" Descartes, on Ryle's account, could not accept the hard truth that mental processes could likewise be explained by reference to mechanical causes and effects. By situating the self in a nonphysical thinking substance, Descartes enforced a way of speaking that renders mysterious ordinary interactions between mind and matter, and limits the body's role to gathering sensory experience and performing actions, to input and output. 10.

For a recent popularization of Ryle's approach, see George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought [New York, 1999], p. 400), who claim that "Descartes' view of knowledge has left its fateful mark on much contem- porary epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language" and summarize that mark thus: "First, that being able to think constitutes our essence; second, that the mind is disembodied; and third, therefore, that the essence of human beings, that which makes us human, has nothing to do with our bodies."</page><page sequence="8">306 MODERN PHILOLOGY The detailed treatment of these problems in Marleen Rozemond's Descartes's Dualism will remind readers that Descartes was hardly the first philosopher to assert the incorporeality of the mind but one of the age's most thoroughgoing mechanists. Well before the seventeenth cen- tury, Aristotelian scholastics developed versions of dualism to uphold theories of the soul's immortality. What remains most striking about Descartes's position from a historicist perspective is not his dualism per se but his account of physical bodies as defined entirely by their mechanistic qualities. Organic processes undergo detailed analysis with- out recourse to postulating the existence of entities such as the "vegeta- tive" and "sensitive" souls. According to Rozemond, Descartes stretched the boundaries of mechanistic explanation to its very limit, retreating only at the threshold of consciousness itself. Citing Antoine Arnauld's skeptical response to the attempt in the Discours sur la mithode (Dis- course on the Method) (1637) to explain animal behavior mechanisti- cally, she observes that Descartes met with contemporary resistance pri- marily because he enlarged the scope of mechanistic explanation to encompass so much. While Descartes certainly entertained the possibil- ity of mind's existence without body, Rozemond argues, his conception of body remains more crucial to his argument than the incommensu- rability of mind and matter. Unlike Galileo and other contemporaries, Descartes "does not reject sensible qualities from the physical world on the ground that qualities of body must be quantifiable." Nor, con- trary to what many philosophers claim, "does he exclude sensible qual- ities from the physical world on the basis of his view that the nature of body is extension." Instead, Descartes adopts a strategy that endorses the mechanistic approach for its superior "intelligibility and explan- atory power" and as a welcome alternative to outmoded Aristotelian theories of sense perception.'2 No less open to challenge is the idea that Descartes, in addition to engineering a permanent schism between thinking and the body, gave an entirely negative account of the emotions. In a recent book, Susan James argues that this conventional view of Descartes-that he rigidly demarcated mental and physical states, allowing no traffic between 12.

Dijksterhuis, The Mechanization of the World Picture: Pythagoras to Newton, trans. C. Dikshoorn (Oxford, 1961), the founda- tional mechanistic view, which attributes no physical qualities to objects of percep- tion beyond geometrico-mechanical characteristics, derives mainly from Descartes.

In Les Passions de l'Vme (The Passions of the Soul) (1649), Des- cartes describes how feelings such as love, hatred, and desire arise in the soul when the body acts on it (CSM, 1:349 ff.) and treats emotions as the products of physiological changes in the heart, blood, and ner- vous system. Intense feelings can cause the body to undergo alteration (e.g., growing pale with fear), providing irrefutable evidence of a causal interaction between mind and body. James concludes that Des- cartes considered abstract thought to be inextricably linked to the passions, and the process of feeling an emotion to be an experience with both physical and mental components. Descartes borrowed from Aristotle, she argues, a view of perception and passion as "powers ex- pressed in the soul-body composite" and found in human experience a pervasive intertwining of perceptual states and feelings: "The capacity of the passions to stream across the line between body and soul is matched by their capacity to cross the boundary around the body."'3 If, as Arnauld pointed out, Descartes's Meditationes (1641) constantly risked absurdity (or at least the appearance of reverting to Platonism) by claiming that knowledge of the self need not entail knowledge of the body (CSM, 2:143), his micromechanical explanations went some distance toward counteracting the tendency to sever mental and bodily states. At the core of Descartes's philosophy lies a mechanistic theory of matter, underwriting many passages in which we find the self treated as the product of an interdependent mind and body, each distinct but capable of interaction. Although mechanical philosophy had important proponents in sci- entists such as Giovanni Borelli, whose De motu animalium (On Animal Motion) (1680) took a Galilean approach to explaining iatrophysical processes, theories of body were embedded in many traditions and practices. In standard accounts of seventeenth-century science, me- chanical conceptions of nature dominate the intellectual landscape, constituting the essence of the scientific revolution. In their own time, however, they enjoyed no such monopoly and functioned primarily to provide models of heightened intelligibility in a universe governed by "laws." Old and discredited notions of occult sympathy, for exam- ple, might reenter circulation once appropriately converted into the new mechanistic currency. For Steven Shapin, mechanical explana- tions function first as metaphor and, claims of "global intelligibility" 13.

Descartes's theories of matter and motion directly undergird his optics, which treats light as an impulse instantaneously conveyed in straight lines through an optical medium. His commitment to mechanistic explanation requires that the propagation of light, as well as laws of reflection and refraction, have a direct connection to body: "I know of only two kinds of bodies in the world in which light is found, namely the stars, and flame or fire" (p. 6). What, it might seem reasonable to ask at this juncture, is a "body"? As Descartes conceded in a letter to Denis Mesland, "I find that this word 'body' is very ambiguous" (CSM, 3:242)-a considerable under- statement. Among the new philosophers many disagreements arose over the active or passive nature of body and the characteristics of the space it occupied. 15 Descartes's thinking on the problem remains ves- tigially marked by Scholastic tradition, which understood "body" as ex- tension in three dimensions, in relation to the genus substance, and as a composite of form and matter. Traces of these mathematical, logical, and physical theorizations resurface, albeit transformed, in Descartes's Principia philosophiae (1644), where body (corpus) figures first as matter extended in space, second as that which marks the circumference of the human self, and third as something rendered intelligible through categories such as number, shape, and size. Descartes recognizes no difference between artifacts and natural bodies, except that the opera- tions of artifacts are performed by mechanisms large enough to be 14.

My thinking on Descartes has been influenced by Shapin, "'Descartes the Doctor': Rationalism and Its Therapies" (paper presented at the University of Iowa, April 1999). Shapin's view of mechanism as a way of doing science "in opposition to the tradition that ascribed to nature and its components the capacities of purpose, inten- tion, or sentience" (p. 37) need not rule out "agency" in the sense that Pickering and I want to use.

Some bodies, because of their smallness, remain imperceptible to the senses, but all are made from the same basic matter. Descartes's Treatise on Man constructs a physiology grounded in authorities such as Hippocrates and Galen but transforms traditional materials by giving them a mechanistic reading. He concludes the work by enumerating "all the functions that I have attributed to this ma- chine" (cette machine): "digestion of food, the beating of the heart and the arteries, the nourishment and growth of the bodily parts, respiration, waking and sleeping, the reception of light, sounds, odours, smells, heat, and other such qualities by the external sense organs" (p. 169). Presented as an experiment in world modeling, the treatise reiterates the importance of grasping, through strict analogy, the mechanist and corpuscularian principles underlying the natural order. He begins and concludes the investigation by drawing attention to his own met- aphor making: "I suppose the body to be just a statue or a machine made of earth," and "I desire, I say, that you should consider that these functions follow in this machine simply from the dispositions of the organs as wholly naturally as the movements of a clock or other autom- aton follow from the disposition of its counter-weights and wheels" (pp. 99, 169). In such passages Descartes invites us to compare his "imag- inary constructs" with the things themselves, confident we can detect no difference.16 In his conception of matter, the medium in which particular physiologies materialize is less important than the formal rela- tions they express. Descartes's imaginary machines have grown so con- summately mimetic and their outward movements so lifelike that they now can "imitate as perfectly as is possible the movements of real men" (p. 169). Clocks are one analogy in an entire repertoire of metaphors useful for describing bodily processes, with respiration, locomotion, and digestion chief among them. From the outset of this treatise Descartes invokes clocks, mills, and other cog-driven systems to illustrate animal physiology, but the main analogy that underpins his model appeals to the principles of hydrau- lic power, of fluids flowing through tubes of various types, shapes, and diameter. In their study of the medieval and early modern experience of wonder, Lorraine Daston and Katharine Park astutely observe that the automatons populating Descartes's mental world recall "stock ob- jects of the Wunderkammern [chambers of wonder] and grottoes" and other contrivances that argue for "the fundamental identity of art and nature." As commentators often observe, Descartes's physiology devel- oped under the impetus of viewing hydraulically powered, mythological 16.

The water-, wind-, and spring-driven automatons of the early modern period bring together elements of classical mechanics-the screw, the pulley, the wheel, the lever-with the new physiological emphasis on vascular force and animal motion. Descartes drafted a short treatise on me- chanics (CSM, 3:66-73), but his most eloquent translation of natural knowledge into the new mechanistic idiom came from his theorizing the body. Descartes could consider the human body a contrivance, artifact, or a kind of gadget because bodies often took a social or collective form in early modern discourses of medicine, politics, and science. Among the most significant technological achievements of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was the substitution of mechanical action for human labor. All such machines foregrounded the social dimension of the human body, symbolizing entire networks of cultural production in a single material object. The trope of the mechanized body enters into multiple realms of knowledge as bodies and machines undergo a complex symbiosis. Machines, persons, and societies as a whole are all pronounced subject to abstract laws of power, control, and force and to a controlling scientific rationality. It is one of the peculiarities of the history of Cartesianism and its later reception that while the theory of a beast-machine excited almost universal ridicule, the theory of the hu- man-machine barely provoked comment. The logic and representation of mechanistic life processes, as Peter Dear shows, made perfect sense "in a world where behavior was so powerfully controlled by one's place in a social system of remarkably precise, and obvious, ordering," where good manners and the proper attitude toward nature amounted to the same thing.18 17.

Conway's own "cabalistic" and vitalistic philosophy, expounded in The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy (1690), takes special pains to refute Descartes for irreligiously positing the existence of an inert matter, without "life and perception": "For truly in nature there are many operations that are far more than merely mechanical. Nature is not simply an organic body like a clock, which has no vital principle of motion in it."19 Des- cartes had certainly anticipated that readers might register the jarring dissonance between the new physiomechanical knowledge and their own experiences of embodiment. In the Description of the Human Body, he appeals to the anatomical knowledge of everyday life, since "every- one has, at one time or another, seen various animals opened up, and gazed on the shape and arrangement of their interior parts, which are very much like our own" (pp. 171-72). Immediately after visualizing the slaughterhouse, however, Descartes settles his gaze on the human body. Again, he prefaces his remarks with the blunt assertion, "I want the reader to have a general conception of all of the machine that I shall be describing" (p. 172), and goes on to construct an imaginary interior world pulsing with thermogenetic movement: I shall say here that the heat that it has in its heart is like the great spring or the principle of all its movements, and that the veins are the tubes which conduct the blood from all the parts of the body towards the heart, where it fuels the heat there; just as the stomach and the intestines are another much larger tube, perforated with many little holes, through which the juices from the food run through the veins, which carry them straight to the heart. And the arteries are yet another set of tubes, through which the blood, heated and rarefied in the heart, passes from there into all the other parts of the body, to which it brings heat and matter to sustain them. (P. 172) strange things about the whole quarrel, none of the ardent defenders of the animal soul in this first period took up the cudgels to preserve the human body from the taint of mechanism" (From Beast-Machine to Man-Machine [New York, 1941], p. 25).

Aristotle, too, had identified the heart as the body's source of heat and life and had stressed the importance of sunlight for the generation of life. On Descartes's account, heat production sends liquid rushing through pipes, a model applicable both to circulation of the blood in the arteries and to artifactual designs using the hydrau- lic principles of resistance and pressure. Despite obvious differences in their material composition, such functionally isomorphic systems look identical on the level of formal organization and the underlying princi- ples of movement. II A figuration of the body in mechanistic terms helped constitute the early modern subject's sense of the self and the surrounding world as artfully fabricated. In a 1649 letter to Henry More, Descartes suggested that since art imitates nature and craftsmen have no trouble construct- ing automatons, it should come as no surprise that nature exhibits a capacity to produce creatures even more elaborate in design (CSM, 3:366). The mechanistic philosophy continually broke down barri- ers between the natural and artificial, encouraging people to regard human artifice as a rival, if not an equal, to nature in the skill of its contrivances. With Behn's "On a Juniper-Tree, Cut Down to Make Busks," we enter into the life of insentient nature and observe in it a far greater resemblance to ourselves than we imagined possible. Rather than placing agency outside of nature, Behn saturates her locus amoenus, the space of pastoral, with vitality and purposiveness. The poem might have first seen light, as Behn's latest biographer conjec- tures, on an evening Behn spent in the company of the coterie sur- rounding John Wilmot, earl of Rochester.20 While its ethical hedonism and libertinism suggest a Rochesterian influence, Behn articulates her preoccupations in a manner that foregrounds physicality, especially heat and motion, in place of Rochester's characteristic fixation on de- tached and seemingly autonomous body parts. Behn shows little trace of an anatomizing curiosity that fragments corporeal wholes through the operations of scientific dissection or poetic blazon. In her poem we intercept a preternaturally aware, although repressed, juniper tree as it leans over a couple trysting beneath its branches. Overcome with 20.

At the poem's conclu- sion, the empathic shepherdess takes pity on the tree and fells it, trans- forming it to "busks" or wooden strips used to reinforce corsets and thereby granting it the proximity it desires, presumably without any diminution of its awareness. Behn depicts the two human bodies that occupy the foreground of her poem in accordance with the conventions of erotic pastoral: shep- herd and shepherdess, handsome swain and fair nymph, Philocles and Cloris. We first glimpse them lying embowered at the tree's "Root," with their "trembling Limbs" pressing against the "yielding Grass" (lines 26- 30), and experiencing arousal as a combustible and involuntary force: I saw 'em kindle to desire, Whilst with soft sighs they blew the fire: Saw the approaches of their joy, He growing more fierce, and she less Coy, Saw how they mingled melting Rays, Exchanging Love a thousand ways. Kind was the force on every side, Her new desire she could not hide. (Lines 41-48) In their "kindling," the couple resembles desiccated tinder, symmetri- cally exchanging positions with the animated tree as shifting sides of a scalene triangle. Several critics note how Behn's eager shepherd "waits no consent" (line 50) and discuss the undercurrent of sexual violence and coercion that accompanies this and many other representations of scenes of "seduction" in Behn's writing. Behn shows signs in this poem, however, of an ironic or even mildly self-critical consciousness on this is- sue of sexual objectification. As Germaine Greer concludes from exami- nation of the textual variants, Behn revised the poem from an earlier version to "give the woman a less passive role," rescripting a conven- tional notion of agency and the gendered dynamics of libertinism.21 In 21.

The entire landscape appears to pulsate with life, with "force on every side." In addition, Behn stresses the generic impersonality of the lovers, the mechanical quality of their encounter, and the automatic aspects of their bodily functions. Commentators often remark that the lovers' interlocking glances, their intermingling of "rays," appropriates, with a difference, imagery from John Donne's "The Extasie": "Our eye-beames twisted and did thred / Our eyes, upon one double string."22 In this line Donne turns to theories of vision that describe sight in terms of "intramission" and "extramission" and that stress the verdicality of perceptual images. Ac- cording to one such view, passed down from the Greek atomists to the sixteenth century, objects threw off images-species, idola, picturae, and so on-that traveled through the air into the eye. Descartes's account of the physiology of vision in the Treatise on Man owes something to these ancient authorities concerning the imprinting of "images" or sim- ulacra, but elsewhere he broke decisively with such representationalist accounts of vision, basing his own theory on a physiology of perception that favors the language of ocular "light and light-rays" (CSM, 1:152). Donne's "eye-beames" appear to emanate from objects and to serve as vehicles for the transmission of little copies or reflections: "And pic- tures in our eyes to get / Was all our propagation."23 Behn revises "The Extasie" by associating Cartesian ocular "rays" with fire, heat, and melt- ing, illuminating the scene of her poem with streaks of light and energy that radiate outward in straight lines, rather than in Donne's "twisted" and doubled lines. (Although it serves here mainly as a local effect, Behn's interest in the new optics would undergo extensive, if mainly parodic, development in The Emperor of the Moon [1687].) The closing lines of "On a Juniper-Tree" take one final metaphysical turn as Behn borrows from "The Canonization" Donne's use of the phoenix as an emblem of self-immolation and resurrection. For Donne, "The Phoenix ridle hath more wit / By us" than other symbols of physi- cal consummation because, like the mythical bird, his lovers "dye and rise the same, and prove / Mysterious by this love."24 For Behn, the phys- ical dissolution of the lovers' bodies, imagined as a liquification of el- ements, justifies the libertine's fusion of sacred and erotic experience: For who but a Divinitie, Could mingle Souls to that Degree; And melt 'em into Extasie. 22.

(Lines 60-65) In one adroit gesture, Behn invokes Donne's poetic authority to join together religious affect with physical pleasure, the sacred with "soft desire." Behn engages a conventional apologetics when she invokes nat- ural theology in defense of sexuality. Yet more conspicuous than an invisible spiritual agency invoked in a rhetorical question are the me- chanical workings of heat, fluids, force, and springs. Prurient but no more pornographic than much pastoral writing, the poem strives to make its readers complicit in a voyeurism that pushes toward disclo- sure of a hidden nature. In so doing, the audience's uninhibited star- ing, like that of the tree, becomes metonymic for curiosity itself. Behn's naturalizing approach to the collision of bodies seems very much the product of the new philosophy, recalling in particular the physiologi- cal and anatomical side of the mechanist project. The lovers pointedly "expire," or cease to draw breath, rather than "dye" in the orgasmic transports invoked by Donne. If the juniper possesses powers of will and "Reason" (line 23) completely unlike what we would normally as- cribe to plants, the physical processes the lovers undergo seem to take place independent of rationality, under a kind of internal compulsion. Momentarily stricken by conscience, Cloris chides "the Swain, for hav- ing prest, / What she alas wou'd not resist," while her partner, "in whom Loves sacred flame, / Before and after was the same," remains abso- lutely constant in his desire (lines 70-73). Such invariability ironically contrasts with the tree's gamut of emotions--"Joyes," "Happiness," "Gratitude"-which swiftly modulate to "grief" and the shedding of "Christal Dew" (lines 76, 79-80, 95-96). Newly acquainted with pleasure but also its surcease, the tree agonizes over "having heard, and seen too much" (line 87), an excess of knowledge. Cloris, "whose Soul is made of Love," acts in a spirit of caritas when she euthanizes the evergreen (lines 98-100), bringing its symbolic import within the compass of Christianity and, to some extent, desexualizing the poem's overt erotic content. If Behn's poem permits us to regard the juniper's eyewitness ac- count as a piece of pastoral fantasy, the tree's performance as a mate- rial agent nevertheless carries significant implications. It dominates a space where human beings are not the sole actors but constituted by their relation to a world of mechanisms through interaction with other bodies and other natural objects. The tree obliquely comments on the modern tendency to relegate persons and bodies to separate catego- ries and, thus, to alienate thought and feeling from ordinary physical experience. Amorous and bigendered, the tree occasionally interposes</page><page sequence="18">316 MODERN PHILOLOGY its boughs "to rob the Shepherd of a kiss" but also gratefully receives Cloris's touch: "The Shepherdess my Bark carest, / Whilst he my Root, Love's Pillow, kist" (lines 36, 82-83). At the outset of the poem the tree assumes a pose of decorous feminine modesty, yielding itself re- luctantly "like bashful Virgins" (line 9), but soon assumes the role of go-between, sacrificing its own pleasure to secure the couple's. What should the reader make of this blurring and blending of subject posi- tions, staged in a wood on the fringes of the human community?25 On first reading, we might interpret this act of arboreal impersonation as a form of poetic license, a trick of pastoral perspective that ultimately reinforces the moral status of the thinking subject. We might keep in mind, however, that Cartesian bodies are themselves figments of a phi- losopher's imagination, even if many seventeenth- and eighteenth- century readers chose to literalize their meaning. The man-machine and woman-machine existed only on paper, conceptualized as analo- gous to actual bodies, not interchangeable with them. The tree's inca- pacity and frustration derive from its final inability to command the bodily resources needed to act on its desires. Along with manifesting obvious signs of sensibility, it combines a capacity to be moved by oth- ers with a power to move others in turn. Yet only with the passionate shepherdess does it establish any sort of lasting link to the human world. Both tree and shepherdess find pleasure in destabilizing fixed categories; they come to resemble one another through a kind of em- ulative hybridization. The desire to which they surrender at first holds out a promise of mutuality but eventually gives way to compulsion and cognitive dislocation. Behn's poetic landscape is not the exclusive do- main of human agency, but human will and power have infiltrated into every corner. Behn's 1689 translation of the last book of Abraham Cowley's Sex Libri Plantarum (Six Books on Plants) (1668)--whose mixture of political allegory, Statian imitation, and forest conservation crystallizes the trium- phalist mood of the 1660s-also features sentient and eroticized trees. Cowley, like many of his contemporaries, took an interest in arboricul- ture, and the political message his trees enunciate is explicitly royalist. "On a Juniper-Tree" departs from Cowley's sylvan fantasy by consciously deflecting attention away from the historical process onto a private 25. Elizabeth V Young ("Aphra Behn, Gender, and Pastoral," Studies in English Literature 33 [1993]: 526-29) argues that the poem blurs "the issue of the tree's individual gender identity into its larger, social identity" and transforms the tree, along with the lovers, into an active participant "in a mutually rewarding relationship." Although the poem could be read to disclose the imitative and performative nature of gender, the erotic space it describes suggests a domain where the categories of social identity operate on trees, as on everything, but without holding out much hope for reciprocity.</page><page sequence="19">Alvin Snider o Cartesian Bodies 317 realm of sensation. Cowley mythologizes King Charles's flight during the Civil War by likening it to the transformation into a laurel of Daphne, who "knew the Mysteries of the Wood / And made discover- ies to her amorous God," contrasting royalist stewardship with Parlia- mentarian despoliation.26 The story of Charles's exile and providential restoration represents the forest as emblematic of a "hidden Nature" (line 14), a place of refuge and secrecy. Before the woodland deities en- wrap Charles in a protective embrace, the literally tree-hugging mon- arch appears in the guise of a "rustick Swain," asleep beneath a shady tree, "Upon whose knotty Root he leans his Head" (lines 1401-3). Charles's absorption into naturalizing myth achieves completion with his hiding in the foliage of the Boscobel oak. At the center of this nar- rative of transformation stands a catalog of trees, including descrip- tions of the common juniper and the savin. Trees of the genusJuniperus are evergreens and have no symbolic associations of the type that made oak synonymous with royalty and the Stuarts. Flourishing close to the ground and best suited to indirect light, the juniper does not "hold Supremacy / (In all the Wood) o'er every Tree" (lines 18-19) like the oak. Behn chooses it for her own poem because of its "verdant Branches," aromatic leaves, and "Eternal Beauty," properties that ren- der it perpetually vigorous (lines 13-21) but also, perhaps, for the rep- utation of the savin (Juniperus sabina), noted by Cowley for producing an abortifacient: By thee, the first new sparks of Life, not yet Struck up to shining flame to mature heat, Sprinkled by thy moist Poison fade and die, Fatal Sabina Nymph of Infamy. (Lines 530-33) Prescribed both as aphrodisiac and to terminate pregnancy, savin's place in the seventeenth-century pharmacopoeia derived from its sup- posed effects on body temperature.27 Philosophers and physicians had long considered innate heat the force behind life processes, including 26.

The "sparks," "flame," and moisture mentioned in the above passage suggest a bodily economy of heat and aridity widely accepted in the Middle Ages, which spoke of male and female "com- plexions" (ratios of hot, cold, moist, and dry) and generally found women cooler and moister than men. When speaking of the elements, Descartes rejects the traditional view of four qualities as needlessly ob- scure (p. 18), and Behn appears to follow suit by not characterizing Cloris along the lines of contrary elemental principles or ancient the- ories of sexual difference. In self-conscious departure from the precedents of Cowley's botan- ical poem and classical mythology, Behn inverts the usual metamor- phic plot by giving us a Charles or a Daphne in reverse. Instead of imagining human beings changed into trees, she pictures an arbore- ous nature in a process of becoming human. It follows, according to the poem's logic, that to compensate for irreparable loss and to end its hopeless longing, the juniper must consign itself to flames. The poem closes with a scene of dismemberment and heroic self-sacrifice: No Martyr for Religion di'd With half that Unconsidering Pride; My top was on that Altar laid, Where Love his softest Offerings paid: And was as fragrant Incense burn'd, My body into Busks was turn'd: Where I still guard the Sacred Store, And of Loves Temple keep the Door. (Lines 101-8) The tree's failed attempt at human embodiment culminates in the her- etic's fate of martyrdom-a remaking of the body as a sacrificial offer- ing and lasting emblem of resistance to external authority. This final ascent in clouds of incense substitutes for the bodily transfiguration and glimpse of immorality that the lovers already have experienced. In "On a Juniper-Tree," Behn inscribes the body as a zone simulta- neously ecstatic and vulnerable, eroticized and martyred, immaterial and tangible. Mechanized bodies, both animate and inanimate, appear in any number of seventeenth-century texts and often taken on heavy spiritual freight. Donne's "A Funerall Elegie," to look no further for an example, figures the dead body of Elizabeth Drury, awaiting resurrec- tion, as "a sundred Clocke."28 The homme-machine and bite-machine tropes persistently function as devices of philosophical explanation precisely 28.

Across a broad cultural topography, the contours of the natural were decisively remapped and lines of demar- cation redrawn. To conclude that Behn's poem simply corroborates the identity-constituting effects of human embodiment, without which the juniper can only suffer in the sense of "to be acted on," misses this point. I have argued instead that Behn's poem takes note of the body's role in constructing a sense of personhood while never losing sight of the physical principles that join trees and shepherds in a common condition. If Behn's poem situates bodies in a realm subtly suggestive of me- chanical ontologies, it nonetheless resists the model's full implications by portraying eros and empathy as beyond intelligibility. In a recent es- say on the suffering self and the challenge it presents to decipherings of the early modern body exclusively "as a locus of sexualized pleasure," Janel Mueller brings to our attention Donne's and Herbert's "uncon- ditional commitment to the embodiedness of human identity" and, more generally, the "protestant premium on embodiment as a defining human property."29 Conversely, Richard Rambuss's book on the bond between sacrality and corporeality in devotional poetry-a conjunc- tion he terms "sacred eroticism" and "gender ecstasy"--discloses the homoerotic desire that underwrites experiences not ordinarily consid- ered sexual.30 Both approaches point out the importance of restoring the body to our understanding of the religious lyric, while avoiding any tendency to write over seventeenth-century literary representa- tions with late twentieth-century categories of sexual identity. To our bodies turn we then. Before doing so, however, I would in closing re- iterate the importance of putting on the agenda a fresh reading of the histories outlined in the preceding pages. Mechanized natural philosophy and pastoral poetry belong among the various discourses that constitute the body's historicity and define its boundaries. Any critique of the interiorized Cartesian subject for its role in the ideo- logical formation of a disembodied masculine ideal-one that ob- jectifies, subordinates, and mechanizes the natural world-would do well to consider these overlapping constructions. 29.
