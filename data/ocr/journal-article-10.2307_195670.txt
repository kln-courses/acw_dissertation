Through the concept of imagination Ibn 'ArabT managed to differentiate between the human and Divine mechanism of creativity, a differentiation which he then used to resolve the paradox of the eternity (qidam) and newness (huduth) of the world. This study aims to examine these aspects of Ibn 'ArabT's complex concept of imagination and to illustrate its transcendental and ontological dimensions. The study adopts a hermeneutical approach to the original texts, by placing more emphasis on the interpretive conditions-which is influenced by a preoccupation with artistic creativity and a desire to understand the creative mechanism of imagination, both at the human and Divine level in the wider ontological framework-than the historical and contextual contingencies. Introduction Abu Bakr Muhammad b. 'All b. Muhammad Ibn al-'Arabl al-Hatiml al-Ta'T, known as Muhyiddin Ibn al-'Arabi (abridged as Ibn 'Arabi), is probably one of the most prolific and influential figures in the history of Islam.1 Born in Murcia, Spain, in 560/1165, Ibn 'Araby is also known among Sufis as al-shaykh al-akbar (the 'Greatest Master'). Like most Sufi masters, Ibn 'Arabi spent his life travelling throughout the Islamic world and making contacts with the most prominent spiritual authorities of the time. He finally settled in Damascus where he died at the age of 78 in 638/1240, and was buried on Mount Qasiyun in the suburb of Shaykh Mu.hyi al-DTn which carries his name to this day. Ibn 'Arabi left us a large body of knowledge which, according to Ibn 'Arabl himself, comprised 289 books and treatises, and according to others 400 or 500.2 Given * Lecturer, Department of Architecture, The University of Adelaide, Australia.

In addition, one can also look to the many commentaries on his works to appreciate the significance of his thought and teachings both for Islam in general, and Sufism in particular. In an introduction to his translation of Fusus al-Hikam, Austin regards Ibn 'Arabi as representing 'a culmination not only of Sufi exposition but also, in a very significant way, of Islamic intellectual expression'.5 Through his writings and teachings, Ibn 'Arab! presents an elaborate and cohesive view of the world based on a very intricate ontological structure. His ontology brings together harmoniously a wealth of philosophical, theological, scientific, linguistic, meta- physical and mystical knowledge, developing it into a cohesive and intrinsic multi-dimensional whole. Interest in Ibn 'Arabi's writings and teachings has increased in the last few decades, particularly in the West. The difficult and complex nature of his texts, however, has kept many of his works, and particularly al-Futuhat, largely inaccessible to the non-Arabic reader.6 Some profound studies of Ibn 'Arabl's philosophy and mystical experiences are available, however, in European languages, among which H. Corbin's Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabf, and W. Chittick's The Sufi Path of Knowledge, are the most pertinent to this study.7 Imagination plays an essential role in Ibn 'Arabi's ontology. It is seen as the creative source of manifestation, the very cause of our existence, and the powerful intermediary that enables us to remain in constant contact with the Infinite and the Absolute. For Ibn 'Arabi, imagination is such an essential cognitive instrument that 'he who does not know the status of imagination is totally devoid of knowledge'.8 Corbin's study of imagination focuses mainly on its multi-dimensional role in the fulfilment of the mystical experience: its theogonic and cosmogonic function; its cognitive and creative role as theophany; and its mediation in the dialogue between God and man, the Worshipped and the 3 Fawat al-Wafaydt cited in Afifi, ibid., p. 6. 4 In this particular work, each chapter contains ten sub-chapters; it was mentioned by Ibn 'Araby in Al-TadbTrdt al-Ilahiyya (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1339 AH), p. 112. 5 Austin, op. cit., p. 14. 6 There is an anthology of translated texts from al-Futuhat in both English and French entitled Les Illuminations de la Mecque/The Meccan Illuminations, Michel Chodkiewicz (ed.)

In his exposition, Corbin appropriately emphasizes the difference between imagination and fantasy. Whereas the cre- ative power of imagination derives from its ontological privileges, fantasy '... is an exercise of thought without foundation in nature, it is the "madman's cornerstone".'9 Chittick's study, on the other hand, focuses on the relationship between metaphysics and imagination, explaining the metaphysical and ontolog- ical nature of imagination and its role in understanding Ibn 'ArabT's metaphysics and ontology. Driven by his concern to 'preserve the overall context of Ibn al-'Arabi's teachings as he himself presents them',?0 Chittick covers far more ground of the original text of al-Futuhat, in which the concept of imagination is discussed, than Corbin. Corbin's hermeneutical flights, however, stretch the concept of imagination beyond the conservative bounds of Chittick's contextual interpretations. But both of these valuable studies have left two aspects of lbn'ArabT's concept of imagination in need of further clarification: first, the difference between the creative mechanism of human and Divine imagination; and second, the way in which Ibn 'Arabi's concept of imagination resolves the paradox of the eternity (qidam) and newness (huduth) of the world. These two aspects are inextricably linked, because it is through the essential difference which Ibn 'Arab! establishes between human and Divine creativity that he manages to resolve the problematic notion of creatio ex nihilo. By focusing on the creative function of imagination, this study aims to examine these two aspects, and to illustrate the transcendental and ontological dimensions which Ibn 'Arab! attributes to imagination, taking it far beyond the bounds of human psychology. The study adopts a hermeneutical approach to the original texts, by placing more emphasis on the interpretive conditions than the historical and contextual contingencies. In this case, the interpretive condition is influenced by a preoccupation with artistic creativity and a desire to understand the creative mechanism of imagination, both at the human and Divine level in the wider ontological framework within which it operates.11 Creative Imagination as an 'Isthmus' (barzakh) Ibn 'Arab! begins his elaborate ontological hierarchy by categorically differenti- ating three existents as being the first knowable things (ma'lumdt) of universal existence. These are: Absolute Being (al-wujud al-mutlaq), that is, the unrestric- ted existence of God, the necessary Self-Existent (wdjib al-wujud li-nafsihi); Absolute non-Being (al-'adam al-mutlaq) which is non-Self-Existent ('adam li-nafsihi); and a Mediator or Separator whereby these two are distinguished one from the other.12 Ibn 'Arabi calls this Mediator barzakh, which may be translated literally as "isthmus", and describes it as the intermediary domain of Archetypes 9 Corbin citing Paracelsus, Creative Imagination, p. 179. 10 Chittick, op. cit., p. xx. 1 The hermeneutical approach as developed by H. G. Gadamer in his book Truth and Method, 2nd edn (London: Sheed and Ward, 1976), pp. 345-67. 12 Ibn 'Arabl, op. cit., III, pp. 46-7. 99</page><page sequence="4">SAMER AKKACH Figure 1. The first level of differentiation in Ibn 'Arabi's ontology. containing the Principles of all possible existents (al-mumkinat).13 The concept of the isthmus as an intermediary world is derived from the Qur'an, which makes more than one allusion to its nature: 'He bringeth forth the two seas, which meet; between them is an isthmus (= barzakh), which they do not go beyond'. (LV, 19-20);14 'He it is who bringeth forth the two seas; one is fresh and drinkable, the other is salt and bitter; and He hath made between the two an isthmus (= barzakh) and a closed barrier.' (XXV, 53)15 These verses portray an image of two integral domains, symbolized by the 'two seas' that are related, yet at the same time separated, by the third intermediary domain, the isthmus (al-barzakh). The unitive-separative nature of the isthmus brings together these two domains, but does not allow them to become mixed. Likewise, the intermediary world of the barzakh forms the borderline between Absolute Being and Absolute non-Being. As one might perceive the borderline between light and shadow, the barzakh delimits the extent of the two neighbouring domains, and prevents each of them from being qualified with the qualities of the other, acting as a common horizon which reflects the realities of both bordering worlds.16 Ibn 'Arabi emphasizes that although the 'isthmus' faces two independent domains, it is not a two-sided mediator, which would mean that the aspect by which it encounters one domain is other than that by which it encounters the other.17 On the contrary, the aspect-which is none other than the essence of the isthmus-which encounters one domain is exactly the same as that which encounters the other. Were it otherwise, there would be an isthmus within an isthmus: the isthmus itself would be divided into three domains, two independent aspects and a mediator that brings them together, since the isthmus is one entity. 13 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., III, p. 518; on the concept of al-barzakh, see Chittick op. cit., pp. 14-16; 117-18; 125-6; Burckhardt, 'Concerning the Barzakh', Studies in Comparative Religion, 13 (1979), pp. 24-30; Abu Zayd, op. cit., pp. 51-7. 14 Translation by Burckhardt, 'Concerning the Barzakh', p. 24. 15 Ibid, p. 24. 16 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., III, pp. 46-7; see also I, p. 304, translated in Chittick, op. cit., pp. 117-18. 17 Ibn 'Arab!, op. cit., III, p. 518. 100</page><page sequence="5">IBN 'ARABI'S ONTOLOGY If this is the case, then this unifying mediator is to be considered the real isthmus (barzakh).18 Ibn 'Arabi also views the intermediary world of the 'Isthmus' as being the means by which the creation and production of the world is effected. He considers the unitive-separative nature of the isthmian mediator (wasTt barzakhi) as being responsible for bringing the initial duality of Absolute Being and Absolute non-Being into a productive mode. That is to say, it is only by means of the 'isthmus' (barzakh) that the delivery of the world from potentiality to act is effected, and the world becomes, as it were, the child born from the fruitful marriage of Absolute Being and Absolute non-Being. In this generative relationship Ibn 'Arabi perceives a pattern which he considers as a constant principle underlying all existence. This pattern is revealed through the intrinsic relationship between triplicity and quadrature. Triplicity is explicit in the three domains, already defined: Absolute Being, Absolute non-Being and the Isthmus; and quadrature is implicit in the dual participation of the Isthmus in the other two domains. Thus quadrature is implicitly inherent in the system that renders these three domains generative and productive. Ibn 'Arabi shows how this generative pattern is directly reflected in the categorical syllogism, determining the productive process of syllogistic reasoning. To arrive at a syllogistic conclusion there must be two premises: for example, every animal has a body (major premise), man is an animal (minor premise), therefore, man has a body (conclusion). This mental operation consti- tutes three explicit elements: two premises, representing Absolute Being and Absolute non-Being, and a conclusion, representing the world. The conclusion is the product, as it were, of the marriage between these two premises, in the same way that the world is the product of the marriage between Absolute Being and Absolute non-Being. But, there is a hidden fourth element without which this marriage would not be productive. This element is the concept of 'animality': it is the 'isthmus' that mediates between the two premises, and is revealed in the repetition of the word 'animal' in both premises. The dual manifestation of the word 'animal' in the two generative premises reveals, outwardly, the principal relationship between explicit triplicity and implicit quadrature in an inverse manner. Triplicity becomes implicit in the distinctive elements-'man', 'animal' and 'body'-and quadrature becomes explicit in that the word 'animal' is actually stated twice. Premise (1) Every ANIMAL has a BODY Premise (2) MAN is an ANIMAL Conclusion Therefore man has a body Based on the above hierarchy, Ibn 'Arab! views the manifested world to be three-fold: higher, lower and intermediary. The higher world is the world of the 'unseen' ('alam al-ghayb), of spiritual being, of angelic forms, the world of abstract meanings; whereas the lower world is the world of the 'seen' ('alam 18 Ibid. See also Abu Zayd, op. cit., pp. 51-2. 101</page><page sequence="6">SAMER AKKACH al-shahada), of corporeal being, of the senses and sensible forms, the world of bodies. In the latter, things are perceived by sight, whereas in the former they are conceived by insight. As is the case with Absolute Being and Absolute non-Being, these two worlds are at once separated and linked by a mediator, a third world, which Ibn 'Arab! calls the 'world of imagination' ('alam al- khaydl).19 The world of imagination, says Ibn 'Arab!, combines the characteris- tics of its two bordering domains: it is the place where the spirituality of the 'unseen' is integrated into the corporeality of the 'seen' to create the subtlety of imagination. It is the ontological level at which spirits manifest in sensible matrices, and abstract meanings take on their bodily forms.20 The world of imagination is the world of dreams where everything is real yet, like a phantom, untouchable and unreachable. Imaginable forms, like dreams, have an appari- tional or phantasmal quality: they are perceivable, meaningful forms yet without physical presence. They are neither purely sensible nor purely abstract. Like an image in a mirror, it is visible, yet not there; it is visible but without a body; and like an illusive mirage, it exists but can never be reached.21 These are the qualities of the isthmian world of imagination. The illusive nature of imaginary forms derives from its intermediary function between the pure and the gross, the spiritual and the physical, the meaningful and the sensible. The world of imagination is the level of existence where this duality is resolved: where the pure is embodied and the body is purified. Imagination is the world where meaning and form are wedded, generating a new world that at once unites and separates its parental domains, just like the twilight zone which unites and separates light and darkness. 'Absolute', 'Detached' and 'Attached' Imagination Ibn 'Arab! says: 'If you say: what is the world of the isthmus? we say: it is the world of imagination.'22 According to the above hierarchy, however, there are two isthmuses: one mediating between Absolute Being and Absolute non-Being, the other between the spiritual and corporeal levels of existence. Ibn 'Arab! differentiates between these two isthmuses by considering the one mediating between Absolute Being and Absolute non-Being to be of a higher order: it is, as Ibn 'Arabi defines it, 'the isthmus of all isthmuses' (barzakh al-bardzikh). Therefore, if the world of the isthmus is none other than the world of imagination, are there corresponding worlds or levels of imagination of a different existential order? The answer to this question is not simple. Ibn 'Arab! distinguishes three ontologically different levels of imagination: a transcen- dental, unrestricted imagination which he calls khaydl mutlaq (lit., 'Absolute Imagination'), an all-encompassing imagination which he calls khaydl munfasil (lit., 'detached imagination'), and an encompassed imagination which he calls 19 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., III, p. 42. See Chittick, op. cit., pp. 15-16. 20 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., II, p. 129; III, p. 42. 21 Ibid., I, p. 304. 22 Ibid., p. 129. 102</page><page sequence="7">IBN 'ARABI'S ONTOLOGY khayal muttasil (lit., 'attached imagination').23 The first corresponds to the higher isthmus, the second to the lower, whereas the third designates the human level of imagination in its psychological framework (being an isthmus between human corporeality and spirituality). In The Sufi Path of Knowledge, Chittick explains this correspondence further by categorically distinguishing three different loci in which imagination becomes manifest: in the cosmos (khayal mutlaq), 'where existence is identical with imagination'; in the macrocosm (khayal munfasil), 'where the intermediate world between the spiritual and the corporeal is imaginal', and in the microcosm (khayal muttasil), 'where the human soul considered as a reality distinct from spirit and body pertains to imagination'.24 Chittick further considers the soul's faculty of imagination to be yet another designation, but in a narrower sense. The relationship between the three worlds of imagination or levels of the isthmus is not that of independence or opposition, but rather of containment: one is contained within the other. Know that you yourself are an imagination. And everything that you perceive and say to yourself, 'this is not me', is also an imagination. So that the whole world of existence is imagination within imagination.25 In the Futuhat, Ibn 'Arabi charges the 'presence of imagination' (hadrat al-khaydl) with many functions and gives it more than one meaning, thus making the correspondence between the hierarchy within the world of isthmus and that within the world of imagination more complex and ambiguous than the simple one given above. Whereas the isthmian world derives its main characteristic from its mediatory role, imagination has creative power, and hence the world it generates has, in addition to its mediatory function, an attachment to a creative faculty or attribute. Accordingly, the correspondence in the hierarchy already explained makes sense only when one considers the world of imagination from the standpoint of its mediatory function, that is, as a barzakh and not as a product of the creative power of a faculty or attribute.26 By detaching imagin- ation from its creative source, one is left with an ontological hierarchy that involves two creative faculties-human and Divine imagination-and three (or four according to Chittick's interpretation) worlds of imagination. The relative ontological autonomy possessed by the faculty of imagination (whether human or Divine), by virtue of its creative capacity, forces one to question the ontological position of the levels that do not seem to relate directly to the creative source. In other words, the ontological status of 'detached imagination' (al-khaydl al-munfasil) in relation to the 'Absolute Imagination' (al-khaydl al-mutlaq) or to 'attached imagination' (al-khayal al-muttasil) raises questions not only about who is imagining at that level, but also about the creative 23 Ibn 'Arabl, op. cit., II, pp. 309-13. Cf. Corbin, op. cit., 219-20. 24 Chittick, op. cit., pp. 116-17. 25 Afifi, op. cit., 104; trans. Izutsu, op. cit., p. 7. 26 Chittick's hierarchy may be explained from the Platonic point of view of the Body, Spirit and Mind of the world, which leads to consider the creative power of the macrocosmic world of imagination in a metaphorical sense. This, however, introduces different interpretive conditions that have other implications. 103</page><page sequence="8">SAMER AKKACH mechanism of its world.27 The text of al-Futuhat is by no means unequivocal on this matter. Ibn 'Arabi discusses briefly al-khayal al-muttasil and al-munfasil, explains in greater detail al-khaydl al-mutlaq and relates al-khayal al-mutlaq to al-khayal al-muttasil,28 but he does not discuss categorically the relationsliips between al-khayal al-mutlaq and al-khayal al-munfasil. It is rather interesting to observe that when Ibn 'Arab! is clearly discriminative about the concept of imagination, in the heading of the chapter in which he discusses the three worlds of imagination, he refers to it by its two worlds al-muttasil and al-munfasil only. In this context, by considering the world of imagination from the standpoint of its creative source, one is inclined to view the 'attached' and 'detached' worlds of imagination as being associated with the human and Divine creativity: 'attached imagination' is associated with the human soul while 'detached imagination' is associated with the Divine Essence (dhat). Viewed in this way, 'Absolute' and 'detached imagination' can be considered to belong to the Divine creative source, while human soul and its imaginative faculty belong to the human. The former is designated as 'detached' and the latter as 'attached'. Ibn 'Arab! explains that our power of imagining things, that is, our ability to conceive of their forms abstracted from their sensible bodies, belongs to 'attached imagination' (khayal muttasil). It is the imagining faculty operating within a human psychological framework. It is referred to as 'attached' because it is, as Corbin explains, 'an imagination conjoined to the imagining subject and inseparable from him'.29 Corbin refers to it as 'dependent imagination' because it depends in its existence on 'detached imagination' which he calls 'auton- omous'. 'Detached' or 'autonomous imagination' refers to a higher ontological state of being which causes all imaginable forms first to exist. The forms conceived by 'attached' or 'dependent imagination' are extracted by the senses from natural forms which are part of the cosmic forms. Cosmic forms embody cosmic realities and belong to a self-subsisting presence dissociable from the imagining subject and entirely independent of him.30 It is what Ibn 'Arab! defines as 'detached imagination' (khayal munfasil), simply because it is an independent presence detached from its lower reflection, the 'attached imagin- ation'. 'Detached imagination' is Divine Imagination, God imagining the world and is the presence of the world in the Divine Mind; whereas 'attached imagination' is human imagination, man imagining the forms of existents brought into existence by the creative power of Divine Imagination; it is the presence of things in the human mind. 'Attached imagination' depends upon 'detached imagination', and the human act of imagining is no more than a 27 Taking Ibn 'Arabl's common example of Gabriel appearing in the form of Dihya, one wonders whether this creative transformation is an autonomous process taking place at the macrocosmic level independent of the creative power of Divine Imagination. If not, then God either has two different modes of imagining, and this is not explained by Ibn 'Arabi, or only one mode, which means that al-khaydl al-mutlaq and al-khaydl al-munfasil are identical so far as creativity is concerned. 28 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., II, p. 310. 29 Corbin, op. cit., p. 219. 30 Cf. ibid., p. 219. Chittick, refers to al-khayal al-mutlaq as 'Nondelimited Imagination', to al-khaydal al-munfasil as 'discontiguous imagination', and to al-khaydl al-muttasal as 'contiguous imagination' (op. cit., p. 117). 104</page><page sequence="9">IBN 'ARABI'S ONTOLOGY participation in the latter. Ibn 'Arabi says: 'From this detached imagination attached imagination derives.'31 Although they both have creative power, 'detached' and 'attached imagin- ation' are essentially different. The realm of 'detached imagination' is a permanent presence whereas the realm of 'attached imagination' is a transitory one. The former derives its permanence from the Divine Eternity, being none other than the presence of the world in the Divine Imagination; whereas the transience of the latter is a reflection of the ephemeral nature of man. The distinction between attached and detached imagination is that the attached vanishes when the one who is imagining vanishes; the detached is an Essential Presence (.hadra dhatiyya) permanently receiving Ideas (ma'dnT, lit., 'meanings') and Spirits so that it embodies them by its special capacity.32 As a transient presence, Ibn 'Arabi divides human imagination into two kinds: dreaming and imagining. The former is an involuntary act while the latter is a voluntary one.33 The voluntary act of imagining involves the retaining of images perceived through the senses by memory (al-quwwa al-hdfi;a), as well as the composing of new images by a form-giving faculty (al-quwwa al-musawwira). Ibn 'Arabi' s concept of 'attached imagination' is similar in structure and function to the notion of imagination formulated by many traditional Muslim philosophers. Generally, imagination was perceived as a human faculty capable of receiving the forms of all sensible objects, of imagining them when they are no longer in contact with the senses, and of imagining or fancying-after recognizing the elementary components by the senses-things which have corresponding realities and things which do not. In accordance with the tra- ditional notion of form and matter, the nature of imagination was analogically compared to a very rarefied or subtle substance supporting the imaginable forms detached by the senses from their sensible matter.34 In the subtle matter of imagination, forms were free from the restraining forces of sensible matter; thus they could easily become merged and fused. The creative nature of imagination gave it the power to deal with, and manipulate, the abstracted forms in whatever way it wished. This is how, for example, 'one can imagine a camel standing on the top of a palm tree or a palm tree on the back of a camel, a bird with four legs, a horse with two wings, a donkey with a human head ...35 Hence the creative power of human imagination was perceived as the ability to deconstruct available forms and to reconstruct new unfamiliar forms that embody new meanings. The power of composing new meaningful images is, of course, the essential foundation of every artistic creation. Ibn 'Arab! asserts that although the senses might not have discerned the new images composed by the human imagination in their composed form, their elementary components must have 31 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., II, p. 311. 32 Ibid., p. 311; Cf. Corbin, op. cit., pp. 219-20. 33 Ibid., pp. 311, 375. See Chittick, op. cit., pp. 115-21. 34 Ibn 'Arabl, op. cit., II, p. 691. On the traditional Islamic concept of form and matter, see S. Akkach, 'Aspects of the Traditional Islamic Philosophy of Art', The Islamic Quarterly, 37 (1993), pp. 44-62. 35 Ikhwan Al-Safa', Rasd'il Ikhwan Al-Safd' (Beirut: Dar Sadir, n.d.), III, p. 416. 105</page><page sequence="10">SAMER AKKACH been sensibly perceived. Human imagination cannot deal with anything that does not have, in part or whole, sensible form.36 This means that our individual imagination is inextricably bound to the sensible world. All the elementary data that fill our imaginary reservoir are extracted by our senses through contact with the phenomenal world, so that our imagination has no power of creatio ex nihilo. We are, nevertheless, able to synthesize things creatively in our imagination according to new, unfamiliar patterns, as when, for example, we form an image of a creature which is half man and half horse, even though there is no existing model for such an image. Neither the image of the man nor that of the horse, however, are pure products of our imagination, but are both no more than imaginary reflections of sensible prototypes. Since human imagination has the power of participating in the world of 'detached imagination', that is, the world of potential existence, it is capable of composing an infinite number of different kinds of images; but owing to its confinement to the sensible domain, its elementary data are limited. It follows that out of the limited data that human imagination has at its disposal, man has the power to synthesize as many forms as there are possibilities latent in the world of 'detached imagination'. In this connection, human imaginative power, in comparison with the imaginative power of the Divine to which the entire domain of 'detached imagination' belongs, fades into insignificance; and despite the infinite possibilities available to God,37 the forms composed in the Divine Imagination, which are revealed to us through the process of manifestation, follow certain, specific and well-defined patterns.38 The question may then be asked: if the human imagination is capable of composing an indefinitude of forms, which includes, as the Ikhwan put it, 'images which have corresponding realities and others which do not',39 what is the value of the composed forms that have no corresponding realities or archetypal patterns? What is the value of the imaginary form composed of, say, half a man and half a horse, if it is a mere possibility?40 An assessment of this and other related questions could shed new light on the value and meaning of traditional Islamic art and architecture. Although Ibn 'Arab! does not address this question, some cues can be found in his teachings. Imagination, he teaches, is corrupt when it does not conform to the realities. Where an imagined form corresponds to its reality in the realm of 'detached imagination', then, and only then, does it fall into the category of 'mental existence' (al-wujad al-dhihni), which is one of the four distinctive degrees of existence:41 36 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., I, pp. 163, 125-6. 37 For the distinction between 'infinity' and 'indefinity', and their relation to 'possibility', see R.

(New York: Larson, 1984), pp. 27-34. 38 The natural patterns that govern the created world. 39 Ikhwan Al-Safa', op. cit., III, p. 416. 40 The concept of imagination plays a significant role in the formation of traditional Islamic art. See S. H. Nasr, 'The World of Imagination' and the 'Concept of Space in the Persian Miniature', in Islamic Art and Spirituality (Ipswich: Golgonooza Press, 1987), pp. 177-84. 41 The four degrees of existence are: (1) al-wujad al- 'aynf (the existence of a thing itself, i.e., in a sensible form); (2) al-wujud al-dhihnr (the existence of the thing in the mind, i.e., in an imaginable form); (3) al-wujad al-lafj (the existence of the thing in utterance, i.e., in an oral form); and (4) al-wujud al-raqmT (the existence of the thing in writing, i.e., in a written form).

Such a code, whose content is made up of the cosmic realities, is considered necessary to prevent the human imagination from degen- erating into a kind of fantasy. Participating in this realm of realities, human imagination can become either a valuable source of knowledge when it complies with the realities of that code, or can become corrupt fantasy when it does not. Furthermore, Ibn 'Arab! teaches that the ignorant person is one who speaks of, or believes in, what he forms in his soul, while that which he has formed has no corresponding form other than itself. Any imaginary form that has no 'existential presence' (hadra wujudiyya) governing its existence is produced by ignorance and the producer is ignorant. 'And anything that has no form except in the soul of its speaker,' he adds, 'vanishes from existence with the vanishing of his saying or the vanishing of his memorising what he may have fancied from his speech, for there is no existential presence (hadra wujudiyya) that governs its existence'.43 With regard to its elementary components, however, whatever is composed in man's imagination necessarily has corresponding archetypes, for human imagination cannot escape the world of archetypes, which Ibn 'Arab! says contains the essences of all possible things. But with regard to a composed form, if it has no existing archetype it would be insignificant, for it would point to non-existence (al-'adam). The sensible form produced according to an insignificant imaginary form has, according to Ibn 'ArabY, no 'fatherly' principle determining its existence but only a 'motherly' principle, that is, the producer himself.44 Creation Through the Divine Breath Although both 'attached' and 'detached imagination' have creative power, the mechanism through which each one creates differs widely. Imaginative pro- duction is not quite the same at both the Divine and human levels of existence, and the notion of 'detached imagination' is not simply a projection of an anthropomorphic characteristic into the Divine realm. In order to understand the creative mechanism of 'detached imagination' one needs to be familiar with Ibn 'Arabi's view of creation. With reference to the tradition which says: 'God created the world through the Breath of the Compassionate' and the Quranic verse: 'Whenever We will the existence of something, We only say to it, "Be!", and it comes into existence.' (Sura XVI, vs. 40), Ibn 'ArabT formed an elaborate view of creation. He says that the world is created through the utterance of the 42 Ibid., p. 309. 43 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., IV, p. 203. 44 Ibid., p. 203. 107</page><page sequence="12">SAMER AKKACH Primordial Word 'Be!', which coincides with both the exhalation of the 'Divine Breath' (al-nafas al-ildhi) or the 'Breath of the Compassionate' (al-nafas al-rahmdn0)45 and the manifestation of the world.46 Ibn 'Arab! also considers that the creation of the world and the Self-manifestation of the Absolute (tajalli) are equivalent expressions.47 Self-manifestation, Ibn 'Arabi explains, has two dis- tinct phases: first, the 'Essential Self-manifestation' (al-tajalll al l-dhdti), wherein the Absolute manifests as 'Immutable Essences' (al-a'ydn al-thabita); and second, the 'Sensuous Self-manifestation' (al-tajallT al l-shuhaudi, wherein the Absolute manifests as 'External Essences'.48 Being an inward act that occurs within the Divine Self or Consciousness, the 'Essential Self-manifestation' does not project outwardly in an 'otherness' differentiated from the 'sameness' of the Essence. The 'Immutable Essences' which are manifested by this determining act are none other than the Names and Attributes of the Essence. Otherness occurs in the 'Sensuous Self-manifestation' when God breathes, exhaling 'the first dense, transparent, luminous Mass',49 a 'Compassionate Vapour' (bukhar rahmdnO,50 that is, the Divine Breath.51 The Divine Breath is the medium through which the Divine Names were externalized, bursting out from the inward realm of formless Being into the outward realm of formal existence, from the state of potentiality into the state of actuality. It is the 'substance of the world' (jawhar al-'alam), in which are found all the latent possibilities of formal manifestation.52 Ibn 'Arab! says: 'All is contained in the Divine Breath, like the day in the morning's dawn.'53 The world actualizes the forms potentially disseminated in the Breath, in the same way that the day brings about all the ordained events that are revealed in its dawn. 'He who wants to know the Divine Breath (nafas),' Ibn 'Arab! further explains, 'let him consider the world'.54 The Breath equates the Prime Matter (al-Jawhar al-Hayladni), which encompasses all the forms of the world,55 and which is the transcendent Substance for all the Divine Artefacts. The Breath in relation to the world can be analogically compared to the ink in relation to all written texts, and to the whiteness of a 45 Or 'the Sigh of existentiating Compassion', as Corbin puts it in his Creative Imagination, p. 185.

The Breath is the source in which all possibilities are fused together as a non-differentiated totality. The Breath, the 'Cloud' and Absolute Imagination If creation was effected through the Primordial Utterance and the exhalation of the Divine Breath, what was the role of imagination in the creative process? Ibn 'Arab! identifies the act of Breathing with that of Imagining (because through Breathing God manifested the forms of all existents), and the world of 'Absolute Imagination' (al-khayal al-mutlaq), with the Primordial Breath. Ibn 'Arab! also identifies the Primordial Breati with the 'Primordial Cloud' ('ama'). The Prophet Muhammad was once asked, 'Where was our Lord before creating His creatures?' He replied, 'In a "Cloud" ('ama'); there was no space [hawd', lit., "air"] either above or below.'56 Ibn 'Arabi says that the 'Cloud' ('amd') mentioned in this tradition is the first form the Divine Breath took, and within which God then differentiated the forms (suwar) of all things in the world.57 The Primordial Cloud is the first affirmatively qualified form of universal manifesta- tion within which the Realities of the world are delivered from potency into actuality, from the formless state into formal existence: Then know ... that the reality of the 'Absolute Imagination' is the so-called 'Cloud', which is the first condition (zarf) support God's outward being (kaynunat al-haqq).58 The Cloud equates with the Divine Imagination because it not only passively receives all the forms, but also actively gives beings their forms.59 It is thus the means whereby God projected forth the Essences of potential beings as cosmic, imaginable forms, and the instrument whose function is to actualize the transcen- dental patterns of Divine Realities in the form of the cosmos. By identifying the realm of Absolute Imagination with the Cloud and the Divine act of Imagining with that of Breathing, Ibn 'Arab! considers that the Divine act of Imagining, unlike the human, occurs from without and not from within the Essence. This is to say that God produced the world the moment He imagined it, and not according to an eternally imagined 'Form' or 'Model' (mithdl). And prior to their existence in the Cloud, the forms (suwar) of the world did not exist as forms in the Divine Self, nor has God imagined them in His Mind prior to their production. This view is somewhat different from Corbin's interpretation: '... we must think rather of a process of increasing illumination, gradually raising the possibilities eternally latent in the original Divine Being to a state of luminescence.'60 'Increasing illumination' implies veiled presence of the Forms 56 Ibn 'Arab!, op. cit., II, p. 310; cf.

Hence the eternal model of the world is God's Knowledge, which, in Ibn 'Arabi's view, differs from His Imagination.61 The Divine act of Imagining the forms of the world coincides with producing them through His Breath, and that is why Ibn 'Arabi identifies the Breath with the realm of Absolute Imagination.62 Here Ibn 'Arab! makes a sharp distinction between knowing and imagining: The conceiver and that which is conceived-each one is of two kinds: a conceiver that knows and has imaginative power, and a conceiver that knows and has no imaginative power; and a conceived thing that has form-according to which it can be known but not imagined by the one who has no imaginative power, and known and imagined by the one who has imaginative power-and a conceived thing that has no form and can be known only. Knowledge is not conceiving the form of the known, nor is it the meaning of the known being formalized, because not every known admits form nor is every knower able to conceive of form. Form-conception is related to the knower through the latter's ability to imagine, and form is related to the known through the state in which the latter is accessible to imagination. And since there are knowable matters that are originally inaccessible to imagination, it is certain that they have no form.63 In keeping with the distinction he makes between the act of knowing and that of imagining, Ibn 'Arab! differentiates clearly between 'form' (sura) and 'meaning' (ma'and). Forms embody formless meanings and as such they are accessible to human imagination. 'The forms, in so far as they are forms,' he says, referring to the cosmic forms, 'are the imaginable, and the Cloud, in which they are manifested, is the Imagination.'64 Thus viewed, Ibn 'Arabi's forms are not permanent and principal models in whose likeness things are made, but are rather the things themselves. So just as there are pure, spiritual forms, there are also sensible, gross forms and intelligible, subtle forms. Together they constitute the cosmic forms that embody the formless 'Immutable Essences', and hence, in Ibn 'Arabi's schema of creation, 'cosmic' and 'formal' are synonymous terms. Meaning, on the other hand, is accessible to the intellect and can be known without necessarily being imagined. The principal 'Meanings' are nothing but the 'Immutable Essences'.65 So the imaginable forms that Ibn 'Arabi speaks of as existing in the Cloud or the Absolute Imagination are different from the knowable 'Immutable Essences', which 'have not smelt the fragrance of exist- ence', residing as they are in the Divine Self. This distinction between form and meaning is consistent with Ibn 'Arabi's conviction that knowledge is not the form of the known imprinted in the knower's soul, that is to say, not the knower imagining the form of the known. He finds support for this conviction in the 61 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., I, p. 119. 62 On the simultaneity of the breathing and the manifestation of the forms, ibid., I, p. 305. 63 Ibid., I, p. 42. 64 Ibid., III, p. 311. 65 Burckhardt compares Ibn 'Arabi's 'Immutable Essences' to Platonic 'Ideas', see, An Introduction..., pp. 62-4. 110</page><page sequence="15">IBN 'ARABI'S ONTOLOGY Divine Name badT', 'Originator' or 'Innovator', mentioned in the Qur'anic verse: 'The Originator [badi'] of the heavens and the earth.' Sura (II, vs. 117)66 This Name derives from ibda' which means 'to create something original, novel, unprecedented', and of which the term bid'a means 'originality' and 'novelty'.67 Commenting on the above verse, he says that the creation of the heavens and earth is associated with the Name badl' because they are created according to no preceding 'model', 'likeness' or 'form' (mithdl). Had the form of the cosmos been identical with the 'Immutable Essences' in non-existence, God would not have been badT', for He would have been creating according to the Form (mithdl) already present in His Knowledge, and there would be no creatio ex nihilo: God says: 'The Originator of the heavens and the earth' because they were created according to no preceding model. The first thing God created was the Intellect, that is, the 'Supernal Pen' (al-qalam): it is the first 'originated creature' (maf'ul ibda'ua) manifested from God-most transcendent. And every creature created without preceding model (mithal) is 'original' (mubda'), and its creator is its 'originator' (mubdi'). So if knowledge is conceiving the form of the known, as some people maintain in the 'definition' (hadd) of knowledge, that creature would not be 'original' (mubda'), because it has in the soul of one who originated it a model, according to which he brought it into existence. To maintain this definition of knowledge would mean that that which is in God's Self has never ceased to be 'necessary being' (wdjib al-wujad), and that God did not originate (ibtada'a) it in Himself, as does the innovator (al-muhdith) when he originates, nor has anything been brought into existence but according to the form (suira), which exists in the Self of the Form-giver (al-musawwir) for [the sake of things to be in] its likeness, not for its own sake, for [God's Self] is not the place of what He creates. It follows that God is not badT' (according to the people who maintain that knowledge is the form of the known imprinted in the soul of the knower); but He is. So He has in Himself no form of what he originates, nor has He conceived of its form [before originating it]. This is a problematic matter. Among the knowable matters (ma'lumdt) there are things that can be formalized and others that cannot, though they are knowable; hence, the definition of knowledge is not conceiving the form of the known. And so likewise is the one who knows: he could be amongst those who are able to conceive of forms, being endowed with imagining faculty, or he could be amongst those who know without being able of formalize, being incapable of giving form. Thus, [for God] form-giving is an act that occurs from without (min khdrij), and He does not receive within His Self what He forms (sawwara) from without, but He knows it. And know first that origination (ibdd') is not possible except with forms (suwar) in particular, because they can be created and can, therefore, be originated. As for meanings (ma'dni), none of them are originated (mubtada'), because they cannot be created and, therefore, cannot be originated, though they can be intellectualized as being essentially immutable ...68 Ibn 'Arabi elaborates this view further through his interpretations of the Qur'anic verse: 'Everything perisheth but His Face', alluding at the same time to the 66 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., IV, pp. 315-16, II, p. 421. 67 Bid'a also means 'heresy'. 68 Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., II, p. 421; (1, pp. 90-1). 111</page><page sequence="16">SAMER AKKACH nature of the cosmic forms contained in the Cloud ('ama'). In this verse, the expression 'His Face' is an interpretation of the Arabic word wajhihi, in which the last syllable hi is the pronominal suffix ha' that may also be taken to refer to the 'thing' in 'Everything'. This means that this verse may also be translated as: 'Everything perisheth but its face (i.e. the face of the thing).' Similarly, in the Prophetic tradition: 'God created man in His Image (suratihi)', the same pronominal suffix ha' may also refer to 'man', in which case the saying would read as: 'God created man in his image (i.e. the image of man).' Ibn 'Arab! explains the meaning of the above verse, understood in the alternative sense, with reference to the forms manifest in the Primordial Cloud. In accordance with his differentiation between the Meaning (i.e. Essence or Reality) and the form of a thing, he considers the form of a thing to be its perishable aspect; whereas its Face is its imperishable aspect, that is, its Reality: Then He caused to exist in the Cloud all the forms of the world, about which He says it (i.e., the world) 'perisheth'-that is, in respect of its forms-'but its face', that is to say, 'but in respect of its reality it does not perish', for the [pronoun] ha' in wajhihi refers to the 'thing'. So in relation to the forms of the world, 'everything perisheth', but in relation to its Realities, the world is not perishable, nor is it possible to be so. For if the form of man perishes, for example, and there remains no trace of it in existence, its reality, which is identified by, and is identical with, man's 'definition' (hadd), would not perish. We say that man is a 'rational animal' (hayawdn natiq) and we do not refer to his being existent or non-existent, because this reality has never ceased to be his even if there were for him no form in existence.69 In spite of the apparent eccentric nature of this, Ibn 'Arabl's conviction is quite fundamental to his doctrine, for through it he was able to resolve the paradox of creation: the eternity (qidam) and newness (huduth) of the world. According to the notion of creatio ex nihilo (creation from nothingness), which is one of the dogmatic issues in Islam, the world must have had a beginning and will therefore have an end. Philosophically, this presents a problem. The existence of the world introduces a circumstantial change to the Divine whose eternal Presence necessitates, from the philosophical point of view, transcen- dence above all changes and transformations. The same applies to the termin- ation of world's existence. This had led many traditional Muslim philosophers to consider or talk about the eternity of the world, that the world coexisted with God, which in turn led to the issue of the end of the world becoming questionable. Thus the paradox was: how could the world be eternal, so that God's transcendence is not contradicted, and at the same time be created from nothingness, so that the Muslims' dogmatic beliefs are not compromised? For a long time this paradox occupied the minds of many traditional Muslim theolo- gians, philosophers and mystics. This was an issue of the utmost importance both at the religious and social levels, because being directly related to the creation and termination of the world, it was concerned with the reality of the Divine Judgment in the hereafter. Nothing testifies to the great significance of 69 Ibid., III, p. 420. 112</page><page sequence="17">IBN 'ARABY'S ONTOLOGY this issue better than the debate documented in Al-Ghazall's Tahafut al-Falasifa (The Incoherence of the Philosophers)70 and Averroes' Tahafut al-Tahdfut (The Incoherence of the Incoherence).71 While both authors put forward valid points, they were totally consumed in their attempts to undermine each others' position on the issue. Their arguments have, however, left one with a sense of uncer- tainty, and with a desire for a more reconciliatory approach. It was through Ibn 'Arabi's concept of imagination that this highly contentious and paradoxical issue reached a state of affirmative reconciliation.72 Through his ontological structure of the world of imagination, he was able to maintain both the eternal presence of the world in the Divine Knowledge as Immutable Essences, as well as the Islamic dogma of creatio ex nihilo.73 The opening statement of al-Futuhdt summarizes Ibn 'Arabi's view of the creation eloquently: 'Praise be to God who brought the world into existence from non-existence and the non-existence of non-existence.' The first negation (non-existence) affirms the newness of the world, creatio ex nihilo, while the following double negation (the non-existence of non-existence = existence) affirms its eternity. 70 Tahafut al-Faldsifah, 4th edn (Beirut, Dar al-Mashriq, 1990). 71 Tahafut al-Tahafut, M.
