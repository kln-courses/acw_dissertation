Whether this occurs or not, Gumerman deserves recognition for undertaking risk. He gives archaeologists something important to think about, emulate, and surpass. A Study of Basketmaker II Settlement on Black Mesa, Arizona: Excavations 1973-1979. SUSAN E. BEARDEN. Center for Archaeological Investiga- tions, Research Paper No. 44, Southern Illinois Uni- versity, Carbondale, 1984. xv + 198 pp., figures, ta- bles, references cited. $8.00 (paper). Excavations on Black Mesa, 1982: A Descriptive Re- port. DEBORAH L. NICHOLS and F. E. SMILEY, editors. Center for Archaeological Investigations, Research Paper No. 39, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, 1984. xxxvii + 858 pp., tables, figures, plates, appendices, references. $27.50 (paper). Reviewed by Gordon C. Tucker Jr., Nickens and As- sociates, Montrose, Colorado. Members of the Black Mesa Archaeological Project (BMAP) have been studying the cultural resources of northern Black Mesa in northeastern Arizona since 1967. These two monographs are the latest in the BMAP publication series. Excavations on Black Mesa, 1982 reports on exca- vations at 23 prehistoric sites, summarizes information collected from over 200 Navajo sites, and describes the rock art of the project area. Ancillary data are sum- marized in 15 appendices. This report is well edited, nicely illustrated, and informative. A Study of Basketmaker II Settlement on Black Mesa, Arizona describes the results of excavations by BMAP at seven Basketmaker II sites. The assemblages and settlement/subsistence patterns evident at these sites are comparable to other preceramic occupations in the Southwest; temporal incongruities probably ex- plain the few discrepancies. A model of settlement and subsistence derived from extraregional ethnographic data was tested, but the uncontrolled effects of broad- scale climatic fluctuations, erroneous assumptions, and differential preservation limited its usefulness. This re- port has a few shortcomings, but none is serious and it does provide a useful baseline for future studies. A Zuni Atlas. T. J. FERGUSON and E. RICHARD HART. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1985. xiii + 154 pp., maps, figures, illustrations, sources, index, appendices. $24.95 (cloth). Reviewed by Richard B. Woodbury, University of Mas- sachusetts, Amherst. Based on material prepared with Zuni cooperation for their land compensation claim against the United States, and arranged for the general reader, this volume contains 44 maps and 41 historical photographs, and an accompanying text that will be useful to the spe- cialist, too. Besides rainfall, geology, early explorations, etc., there are maps of, for example, Zuni trade, tra- ditional plant collecting, hunting and herding areas, and shrines. Map 21, "Area of Zuni Sovereignty, 1846," is surprising, as it includes everything from the San Francisco Peaks to Mt. Taylor and south to the head- waters of the Gila, an area "held ... for centuries, against many aggressors." It is, however, also defined as the area whose resources were essential to support the traditional Zuni way of life. Settlement, Subsistence, and Society in Late Zuni Pre- history. KEITH W. KINTIGH. Anthropological Pa- pers of the University of Arizona, No. 44, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1985. x + 132 pp., figures, tables, appendix, references, index. $14.95 (paper). Reviewed by Richard B. Woodbury, University of Mas- sachusetts, Amherst. A comprehensive review of the past century of Zuni archaeology, Kintigh's own fieldwork and archival re- search, and revision of Zuni ceramic chronology make this a major contribution to Southwestern archaeology. Emphasis is on A.D. 1250-1540 and on interpreting settlement pattern changes in relation to natural re- sources and problems of social integration. Also, set- tlement shifts are shown to be "accompanied by changes in agricultural technology." There are broad implica- tions for the analysis of the rapid aggregation of the population from hundreds of small pueblos to only a dozen or so very large ones. Prehistoric Agricultural Strategies in the Southwest. SUZANNE K. FISH and PAUL R. FISH, editors. Anthropological Research Papers No. 33, Arizona State University, Tempe, 1984. vii + 387 pp., fig- ures, tables, plates, biblio. $17.50 (paper). Reviewed by Richard Ambler, Northern Arizona Uni- versity. This volume represents papers presented at two sym- posia held in 1981, plus a few additions. As would be expected from 21 papers by 31 authors, the content, areal coverage, and temporal aspects are distinct, and their quality varies from offering new insights on as- pects of agricultural adaptation to repetition of ideas that have been around for decades. Many of the papers deal with the southern and central Southwest, with some excursions up the Rio Grande and to the Chaco, Mesa Verde, and Sinagua areas. The knowledgeable Southwestern archaeologist may or may not find new data about his or her specialty, but the non-specialist may well find much material and interpretations of interest.

This comprehensive, well-organized review is divid- ed into seven sections: a thorough, brief review of the natural environment, a critical assessment of previous research, a synopsis of prehistory, site descriptions, previous stabilization attempts, ethnographic obser- vations, and recommendations. Especially interesting are the criticisms of stabilization efforts and the criti- cisms of widely held beliefs about links between Ka- yenta Anasazi and ethnographic Hopi. Les Mayas. CLAUDE-FRANCOIS BAUDEZ and PIERRE BECQUELIN. L'univers des formes, Le Monde Precolumbien serie, Gallimard, 1984. xiv + 409 pp., illustrations, maps, biblio. Cloth. Reviewed by Prudence M. Rice, University of Florida. Lush and sumptuous may not be the only words to describe Les Mayas, but they certainly are among the most apropos. One of a series of three lavishly illus- trated volumes on "Le Monde Precolumbien" (the oth- er two treat Central Mexico and the Andes), Les Mayas is more than just another bit of coffee-table fluff. Be- sides superb color and black-and-white photographs (of remarkable quality, revealing details of surface tex- ture and technique in stone, jade, and pottery), the volume features a highly informative text, abundant line drawings of building complexes, site maps, recon- structions, and an illustrated glossary-index of art mo- tifs, gods, and Maya place names. The textual material begins with several introductory chapters on the Maya civilization and the genesis of Maya art. As one might expect, the focus of the book is on what the authors call "l'Apog&amp;e," or Late Classic period, A.D. 550-950, with about 175 pages of text and photographs devoted to the various media of expression of the Maya civilization in this period. Ar- chitecture and sculpture are addressed for each of the major subregions of the Maya area and then within these regions, separate treatments are given for indi- vidual sites, such as Tikal, Palenque, Copan, etc.; the other topical subdivisions are ceramics (vases, censers, and figurines) and portable art (jade, other stone, and shell). Following the section on the Classic period, shorter chapters treat the Puuc area, the "Maya-Tol- tec" Early Postclassic period, and the Late Postclassic. There is little here that is new: many of the photo- graphs that commonly illustrate books on Maya art and archaeology are included in Les Mayas, and as usual the emphasis is on the Lowlands and on the Classic period. It is refreshing, however, to have a book about Maya art and architecture written by archaeol- ogists, so that there is less stress on the emotional im- pact of the art and more on its cultural significance. Furthermore, authors Baudez's and Becquelin's ex- periences are primarily in the southern and peripheral Maya areas (Highlands, Chiapas, and Southeast pe- riphery) so that these frequently slighted regions are given a bit more attention than is the typical practice.

Reviewed by Joseph Mountjoy, University of North Carolina, Greensboro. Agrinier's monograph is a superbly illustrated report on investigations conducted in 1973-1975 at a location 100 km from the Pacific Coast. Research focused on the nature and extent of Early Olmec (San Lorenzo phase) deposits. Three discrete artifact concentrations were tested. Two, on the south side of the river 100 m apart, appear to be habitation areas. Excavations un- covered sherd refuse and some stone artifacts, plus one drilled piece of iron ore. The third area, located across the river and 1 km from the other two, has thousands of pieces of iron ore of unknown but non-local source, and a few Early Olmec sherds. Agrinier suggests that these sites indicate colonization by people from the San Lorenzo area who farmed and manufactured items of iron ore for export. He does not explain why these people would work iron ore at such a distance from their village. McDonald's publication is a concise and well-illus- trated report on his 1971 investigation of a 25-mound Olmec site located 12 km from the Pacific Coast in extreme southwestern Chiapas. Thirty-nine units, mostly 2-m pits, were excavated. Some of these ex- posed decorated stone monuments were in their orig- inal context; most notable were the jaguar and serpent head blocks flanking the base of a stairway, and two stela-like monuments with anthropomorphic designs flanking an altar next to a tomb of stone slabs. These monuments appear to date within the last 350 years of the cultural sequence at the site, radiocarbon dated (and recalibrated) to between 1100 B.C. and 300 B.C. Hopkins's memoir derives from fieldwork in 1968- 1970. It is a study of agricultural intensification and population from pre-Hispanic times to the present in an area marginal to nuclear cultural developments. Ethnohistorical and archaeological data are utilized to analyze cultural processes that are proposed to be ap- plicable to Mesoamerican civilization in general. The ethnohistoric sections admirably document the inter- play between economic geography and population trends.
