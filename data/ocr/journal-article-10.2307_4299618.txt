<plain_text><page sequence="1">131 PREHISTORIC COPPER AND BRONZE METALLURGY IN WESTERN IRAN (WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO LURISTAN) By P. R. S. Moorey The prime purpose of this paper is to present as concisely as possible the results of a series of spectro- scopic analyses of " Liristdn Bronzes " recently undertaken in OxfordI in preparation for a catalogue raisonne' of the collection of Ancient West Iranian Bronzes in the Ashmolean Museum, and to integrate the information they yielded with other more scattered evidence for the history of metalworking in the region from its earliest appearance until the seventh century B.C. In the last decade work both in the field2 and in the laboratory3 has contributed significantly to a better understanding of the metal industries of western Iran and their place in the cultural history of the area. Although the bronzes from Liristan are no longer the isolated and enigmatic phenomenon they used to be, they still constitute one of the most remarkable aspects of Iranian achaeology. Following a pattern recurrent in archaeology information on metal working from settlement sites in the area is still very sparse, despite intensified exploration in the last ten years. Virtually all the available evidence comes without certain context from plundered cemeteries of cist graves varying considerably in date; exceptionally bronzes seem to have been deposited, again in quantity, in shrines.4 Systematic study of these disjecta membra of Liristan's bronze industry is a salvage operation, at all times subject to the difficulties and uncertainties of such an undertaking. The following essay attempts to provide a framework round which the available evidence may be assembled; it will need to be constantly dismantled and re-assembled as fresh evidence adds new dimensions to the structure and corrects false perspectives.5 Danish excavations in Hulailan,6 Vanden Berghe's work in Ilam,7 French excavations at Tepes Giyan and Jamshidis and American excavations at Kamtarlan and Chigha-Sabz9 indicate, as is only to be expected, the existence of a local metal industry throughout Lfiristdn from at least the later fourth millennium B.C. So long as a relatively restricted production of simple personal ornaments, tools, weapons and sheetmetal vessels, primarily undecorated, was the total extent of this industry, Liiristan was no different from many areas of south-west Asia in antiquity within reasonable reach of the neces- sary raw materials. It is the comparatively sudden appearance of an immensely varied and richly decorated range of bronzework in great quantity which defines a distinct cultural phenomenon, restricted both in time and distribution. This type of bronzework, closely associated with the earliest production of iron in the region, is distinguished by a particularly elaborate and often highly conven- tionalized form of cast bronze decoration in which animals play the main part, but sub-human 1I am most grateful to Mr. R.

It is most characteristically represented by the " standard-finials " with their mounts, certain elaborate open-cast pinheads (" wands "), whetstone sockets and decorated cheekpieces for horsebits. Technically distinct from these, but linked to them in many ways by style and iconography, is a sheetmetal tradition related to an industry in western Iran considerably more widespread than the cast bronze tradition of Liristan. Excavations in a shrine at Dum Surkh,al an important single stratified find from Bdbd Jnl'2 and comparative evidence both inside Iran and beyond indicate that this specialized metal industry flourished from the ninth to the later seventh century B.C., virtually contemporary with cemetery " B " at Tepe Sialk away to the east, which provides a valuable paradigm for the widely scattered metal artefacts from Liristan. Although the immediate antecedents and demise of this industry are still far from clearly understood, the main features of these changes may be discerned. The History of West Iranian Metallurgy to c. Iooo B.C. Native copper was used in Western Iran by at least the seventh millennium B.C., as also in Anatolia.13 A globular bead from Ali Kosh, dated c. 6750-6000 B.C., was made of cold-hammered native copper, cut with a chisel and rolled into shape.14 Simple hammered copper objects: pins, projectile points and a coil of metal were found at Sialk in Level I, of the early fifth millennium B.C.15 By Level II, c. 4500- 4000 B.C., there is evidence for annealing and the range and quality of surviving copper work is greater.16 The form of the spearheads has developed markedly and awls and personal ornaments appear. At Tall-i Iblis on the Iranian plateau, south-west of Kirmin, in settlement levels contemporary with Sialk II, evidence for copper working in a domestic setting has recently been revealed.17 Many frag- ments of baked clay crucibles showing copper stain and dross were found there among domestic debris dated by Carbon 14 to c. 4000 B.C.; a copper smelting pit is possibly earlier. The first clear evidence for cast copper is the distinguishing feature of substratum 4 of Level III at Sialk, late in the fifth or early in the fourth millennium B.C. At the same time metal is more commonly used for tools previously made in bone and stone. In the earliest phase of Sialk III were found needles, either with a pierced or folded head, " pins " with both ends slightly swollen and awls.18 In III, phase 2, pins are longer and the first tanged dagger blade appears.19 In III, phase 4, long pins with conical heads and a shaft-hole hoe mark a fundamental stage in the development of local metallurgy.20 In phase 5 the metalsmith's repertory has grown considerably to include more needles, and pins, chisels, flat axes, both hammered and cast in open moulds, and fine dagger blades with long tangs.21 The first sheetmetal vessel, a simple open copper bowl, appears in phase 7b, in the second half of the fourth millennium B.C.22 According to Le Breton Susa A, in the early fourth millennium B.C., yielded many flat axes, large and small chisels, pins and flat disk mirrors.23 In Susa B there are shaft-hole hoes like the one from Sialk III (4).24 At Tepe Giydn in LUristdn cast copper flat axes and awls were also in production by the 10 See E.

The appearance of worked copper at Qatal Hiiyiik soon after the middle of the seventh millennium B.C. and the copper shaft-hole mace-head from Can Hasan, dated before c. 4700 B.C.27 may mean that Anatolia's earliest metalworkers were as skilled and precocious as their better documented successors of the third millennium B.C. Recent discoveries in Israel have made clear that the repertory of objects and technical skill of smiths in the later fourth millennium B.C. were very considerable, radically altering the conclusions previously drawn from the scant existing evidence.28 It must therefore be constantly borne in mind that for the history of metalworking, so ill-represented in most tell excavations, a single hoard or well equipped cemetery may transform understanding of the subject. It is not yet known where the casting of shaft-hole tools and weapons in bivalve moulds was first perfected. Deshayes has argued that this method of hafting was first discovered in Iran, citing the shaft- hole hoes from Sialk III and Susa B to support his hypothesis.29 Here again the nature of existing evidence is crucial. The early appearance of copper shaft-hole axes in Mesopotamia has to be deduced still from baked clay models with splayed blades which, as Childe pointed out, can only copy metal patterns. These primarily belong to the 'Ubaid period, before about 3500 B.C.30 A thorough metal- lurgical study of the Can Hasan mace-head would probably reveal whether or not it is the earliest known object cast in a bivalve mould. It is, of course, still possible that smiths in Iran were important pioneers in the development, but it is by no means yet certain that they initiated it.31 Analytical results from various areas in the Near East and the eastern Mediterranean region have made clear that an intentional arsenic-copper alloy was often, if not invariably, an important stage in the transition from cast copper to the use of a tin-copper alloy. Alloys of up to 8 per cent arsenic are easily worked, hot or cold, and can give strength and hardness equivalent to tin-bronze, whilst the presence of arsenic is very useful in maintaining the workability of the copper.32 This alloy was probably first employed in the Near East sometime in the second half of the fourth millennium B.C. and might well have arisen from an accidental use of an arsenic-enriched copper ore. In Israel arsenical bronzes appear in the Nahal Mishmar hoard, late in the fourth millennium B.c., and among the objects in the Kafr Monash hoard dated to Early Bronze Age II, in the early third millennium B.C.33 In western Anatolia, Cyprus, the Cyclades and in Crete arsenical-bronzes were current before tin-bronzes appeared in the middle and later third millennium B.C.34 Among objects from Horoztepe in Anatolia analyses showed that high quality tin-bronzes appeared concurrently with arsenical-bronzes in the third quarter of the third millennium B.C.35 At Ur the few metal objects analysed from the Jamdat Nasr levels, c. 3000 B.C., included objects with percentages of arsenic ranging from I 35 to o. 36. This is in marked 25 Giyan, pp. 43 ff. 26 R. Dyson in R. W.

It has been shown, by detailed examination of early Danubian copper shaft-hole axes, that shaft-holes were made by drilling a circular hole through a flat axe-head after casting in an open mould (H. H. Coghlan, Archaeologia Austriaca XXIX (1961), PP. 57 ff.). In other words, a technique appropriate to making shaft-hole axes in stone was initially applied to their earliest metal counterparts.

In Level K at Geoy Tepe, west of Lake Urmia, arsenic appears in a fairly high proportion after a period, Level M, when copper was singularly pure.3s Level K is contemporary with Level II at Kjul'-Tepe in Soviet Azerbaijan which has a Carbon 14 date of 2920?90 B.c. Systematic analysis of the metal objects from the superimposed settlement levels at Kjul'-Tepe (I-IV), where moulds and industrial debris indicate local manufacture, has shown graphically the definite stages of transition from copper in Level I to an arsenical-bronze in Levels II-III and then a tin-bronze in Levels III-IV, from late in the fourth to early in the third millennium B.C.39 In the early third millennium B.c. arsenical-bronzes were widely used in Caucasia and Transcaucasia.40 They were probably obtained by melting together the copper and arsenic ores of the region. Among the metal objects without context reported from Ltiristin are a few arsenical-bronzes. In every case they are artefacts which may be dated typologically to the middle or later third millennium B.c. An axe, closely paralleled at Ur and Susa,41 a dagger, both its hilt and blade, with close typological relatives at Kish and Ur,42 a pick-axe, paralleled in Mesopotamia,43 and an axe-head with zoomorphic decoration44 have arsenic percentages ranging from I 9 to 4"4. An axe analysed in Sydney, again of mid-third millennium date, has 0 -20--0.50 per cent arsenic; another of similar date in Oxford has 2. I per cent tin, 2 -8 per cent arsenic.45 The few analyses of contemporary artefacts from Susa show that they were predominantly made of cast copper46. Evidence so scanty as this may easily distort the overall picture, but it now looks as if arsenical-bronzes were being produced in the second half of the third millennium B.C. in central west Iran and that they may have been produced for some time simultaneously with cast copper and tin-bronze objects. It is quite possible that where arsenic ores were easily available (its occurrence is much wider than that of tin)47 and tin was scarce, it survived in use as an alloy much longer or was used intermittently until well into the second millennium B.C. Charles has suggested that the main objection to its persistence is not so much a metallurgical as it is a medical one; the extreme toxicity of most arsenic salts made the manufacture of arsenical-bronzes a hazardous process for the smiths.48 Long before a copper-tin alloy came into general use implements appear with definite inclusions of tin in the copper.49 These are usually described as " accidental " bronzes produced by using ores from a lode in which tin was associated with copper; a not unusual occurrence. Coghlan has defined a deliberate copper-tin alloy as one in which the tin exceeds approximately 3 per cent.50 Voce, on the other hand, believed as little as o 50 per cent tin was a deliberate addition in periods when contem- porary bronzes had as much as 10 per cent tin in them, as in Level D at Geoy Tepe,51 in the earlier second millennium B.C. Junghans has also argued that a deliberate alloy may be as low as I per cent tin.52 What may certainly be identified as deliberate copper-tin alloys appear first in the Near East in the 36 C. L.

The earliest history of the alloy is still obscured in many areas by the dearth of analyses. An archaic text from Ur, of the early third millennium B.C., differentiates between copper and bronze.53 Tin-bronzes appear in the " Royal Cemetery " at Ur54 and at Kish and Khafajah55 by about 2600 B.C.; evidence from Syria and Anatolia is so far slightly later.56 There seems little doubt that the alloy was only used in Egypt as a result of contacts with western Asia.57 In western Anatolia tin-bronzes appear in Troy II5s and at about the same time in the Cyclades.59 It is possible that the earliest tin-bronzes yet identified by analysis are those from Caucasia and Russian Azerbaijan.60 A number of good quality tin-bronzes were found in Level D at Geoy Tepe,61 in the earlier second millennium B.C. In LUristdn tin-bronze shaft-hole axes, pick-axes and adzes, were in production by the late third millennium B.C. or very soon afterwards.62 The tin percentages range from 3 -6 to 13" I and two examples have comparatively high arsenic percentages."3 Evidence from elsewhere has shown that ancient smiths eventually aimed at a more or less standard alloy with about Io per cent tin; erratic variations are a natural feature of early tin-bronzes. By the later second millennium B.C. in Ltiristdn, as elsewhere in western Iran, it is clear that local smiths had a keen appreciation of the properties of this alloy and had achieved some skill in regulating it. The higher the percentage of tin in a copper-tin alloy, up to about 15 per cent, the harder and stronger is the resulting metal, without increasing the difficulties of hot and cold working under the conditions prevalent in antiquity. Signifi- cantly, it is the flange-hilted dirks and their typological relatives, most widely used in western Iran in the later second millennium B.C., which most consistently show high percentages of tin, up to a maximum of about 15 per cent. The history of metalworking in Lfiristdn from the middle of the third to the end of the second millennium B.C. may not yet be established in any detail, but its predominant characteristics are clear already. Whereas in the earlier first millennium B.C. the region's metalwork was distinguished both by objects and decoration without known parallel elsewhere, in the previous period both the range of artefacts and their forms had a great deal in common with those produced in Elam, Mesopotamia and North Syria. Links with Elam were particularly close. For instance, with minor variations, all the main types of shaft-hole axe occur both in Elam and in Liristdn with striking regularity; only Ur outside western Iran has anything like a parallel range of forms and that only includes half the types reported from Iran.64 Vanden Berghe's excavation of eleven cist graves of the third quarter of the third millen- nium B.C. at Bani Surmah in the region of Ilam has demonstrated the extremely close affinity between the metalwork of this part of Liristdn and its neighbours to the west and south-west.65 Indeed the area seems to form the most easterly province of the material culture so richly illustrated by American excavations on sites in the Diyala valley,66 which also has many cultural links with Elam. At this time a very similar range of metal artefacts was in use in eastern Liiristan to judge by finds from Tepe Giyan and other unknown sites in the area. The quantity of metalwork in the graves at Bani Surmah certainly suggests local manufacture and that parity of form between artefacts from controlled excavations in Elam and Mesopotamia, and unprovenanced finds from Liiristdn, does not necessarily mean that the 53 E.

Such cultural affinities are the natural complement to the close political contacts between all these regions which are clear from surviving inscriptions of the later third and early second millennium B.C.67 It is probable that Elam was the original home of the cast zoomorphic decoration on tools and weapons which was so characteristic of the west Iranian metalworking tradition, but comparatively rare elsewhere.68 The earliest example of certain date from Susa is on a hammer inscribed for Shulgi of the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2095-2048 B.C.).69 As Shulgi's activities in Elam are well documented this object may be taken, as its form suggests, for an Elamite rather than a Sumerian artefact. A number of other objects from Susa70 demonstrate that by the first quarter of the second millennium B.c., if not earlier, a tradition of zoomorphic decoration on tools and weapons, possibly all votive or parade pieces rather than serviceable objects, was well established in Elam and slowly diffused northwards. In Liiristan a series of adzes with crudely cast zoomorphic decoration on their butts and a series of " maces " with relief decoration follow Elamite fashions.7 An axe decorated with a simple lion passant on the butt, reported to be from Lfristan, belongs to this period.72 Analysis showed that it was an arsenical-bronze with an unusually high percentage of lead--3.6-which was almost certainly added intentionally to facilitate casting the animal. During the earlier second millennium B.c. at a time when links between the Zagros region, Assyria and Syria are also clear from the distribution of the " Khabur " and cognate styles of painted pottery73 identical tool and weapon types indicate a close relationship between the metal industries of the same regions. Deshayes argued that this might be correlated with the diffusion of Hurrian-speaking metal- smiths.74 Such a comprehensive historical hypothesis is seductive, but, apart from the hazards of associating a particular set of artefacts with any given people or state, its chronological and topo- graphical basis needs examination before it may be accepted. de Vaux, in an excellent concise review of Hurrian history,75 has made clear the long period of time, and very wide area, over which Hurrian activity may be recognized in the Near East from at least the Dynasty of Akkad. The cultural settings in which they may now be traced are many and various. Their presence at Susa is virtually certain, but the extent of their influence on Elamite culture is still obscure.76 It would seem too early to estimate whether the occurrence of an identical type of tool or weapon in North Syria and Lfiristtn indicates a flow of craftsmen, perhaps Hurrian, westwards or vice versa; if indeed it involves migrating peoples at all. It is arguable that two other factors, apart from direct exchange of objects through trade, regulate the diffusion of metal artefacts and, when personal contact is involved, of techniques: the activities of armourers in invading armies and the deportation of captured smiths, neither necessarily linked to a specific linguistic or ethnic group.77 The extent to which trade in copper and tin from Iran, along the northern route westwards into Assyria and Syria, brought closer contacts between the smiths of the regions through which it passed in the second millennium B.C. is virtually impossible to gauge accurately, but it may have been more significant than is yet allowed. Throughout the second millennium B.C. the political power of Elam and the remarkable vigour of its metal industries stifled the development of large-scale independent production in Lfiristin, though her smiths continued to provide for local needs without displaying much originality in the forms and decoration of their metalwork. Political changes towards the end of the millennium brought fresh opportunities. Throughout Elamite relations with Mesopotamia, of which she was in fact geographi- cally a part, were always close, if periodically stormy, and both regions drew upon the other's resources 67 W.

At the end of the twelfth century the political balance was radically altered. In the last decade of this century Nebuchadnezzar I (c. 1124-1 o3 B.C.) of Babylon crippled the political power and influence of Elam with a crushing victory over Khutelutash-in-Shushinak, whereafter he ravaged Elam, including Susa.78 His successors on the throne of Babylon for the next century or more continued the subjection of Elam and its closest dependencies to the north. Susa was greatly impoverished and very poorly equipped tombs overlay the sanctuary of Inshushinak in the early first millennium B.C.79 For about three centuries Elam disappears from Mesopotamian sources and there are no native texts.80 Such a major catastrophe must have had important repercussions among the mountain peoples to the north of Elam who, in varying degrees, had long fallen under her influence. The most tangible evidence from this region for an increased Babylonian presence from the later twelfth to the middle of the tenth century B.C. are the various inscribed bronze weapons reported from Liiristmn. By far the greater number of these are inscribed for Babylonian monarchs of the Second Isin and immediately subsequent dynasties or their subjects. The earliest inscribed dagger is for a late Kassite ruler, Adad- suma-usur (c. 1218-1189 B.C.)81 with at least one for every ruler from Ninurta-nadin-Sumi to Adad- apla-iddina (c. I 130-Io46 B.C.). It is curious that after this period apparently, with the possible excep- tion of Nabu-mukin-apli (c. 977-942 B.c.), daggers are replaced by arrowheads, which again predomi- nate for one short period from Eulmas-sukin-vumi to Ninurta-kudurri-usur II (c. 1003-942 B.C.).82 It will be interesting to see whether further examples confirm and broaden this pattern. Although the paucity of comparative material from Elam severely restricts the argument there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a considerable Elamite legacy in the independent cast and sheet bronze traditions of Lfiristan from the tenth century B.C., particularly its iconography.83 By contrast there is virtually no evidence before the early seventh century B.C. for major northern influences in Liristan, either in ceramics or metalwork;84 what intrusions there were, and their source is still not clear, blended with the existing local cultures85 to a large extent. With the collapse of the Elamite metal industry and the destruction of Elamite political power after the Babylonian devastation it is reasonable to assume that Elamite smiths fled northwards for refuge in the mountains, taking the skills and styles of their homeland with them to invigorate the bronze industry of LSiristan, where the vital raw materials: metals, fuel and wax were readily available. By the late tenth century B.C., no longer overshadowed by the great Elamite metal industries and temporarily freed from direct Elamite or Babylonian incursions, the smiths of Loiristan were free to develop a style congenial to their local patrons' way of life and religious beliefs, incorporating the skills and iconography of Elam, and to a lesser extent of Mesopotamia, which is so clear in much of their decorated bronzework. If the patrons were newcomers, then they very readily accepted indigenous traditions; in the absence of documentary evidence it is best to accept their anonymity for the moment. The eclipse of this industry in the later seventh century is probably to be associated with the increasing political unity and expansion of the Medes and their associates, who ousted its patrons, cut off the lines of supply for metal from the north and east, and supported other major metal industries to the north of Liiristan. THE LCRISTAN INDUSTRY, c. 900-650 B.C. Organization and Patronage It is probably idle to speculate about the organization of an industry which has left no written records, but certain statements are commonly made about the L-rist^n bronze industry at its most prolific which require qualification even with the evidence to hand. It is sometimes argued that 78 R. Labat, Elam and West Persia, c. r200oo-ooo B.C., pp. I ff. 79 de Mecquenem, RA, XIX (1922), pp. 13I if., 139. 80 R. Labat, Elam and West Persia, c.

That some of the patrons of this industry led a nomadic existence is virtually certain, since seasonal transhumance has long been a familiar pattern of life among the region's pastoralists;87 that they all did seems unlikely. Most metal industries in antiquity, particularly those producing very elaborate artefacts, were supported by a small minority representing the ruling group.88 On the analogy of cemetery " B " at Sialk the owners of the fine bronzework from Liristan are to be seen as members of a warrior aristocracy, distinguished, as so often in history, by the possession of a horse and the wherewithal to equip it and themselves for battle. They may be seen as the ruling members of the larger, permanent settlements in the lower western plains or citadels in the higher eastern plains89 dependent on agriculture, horse-breeding, and perhaps control of the north-south trade route, for their prosperity. The great complexity and quantity of the bronze artefacts made in Liristdn between the late tenth and early seventh centuries B.C. and the pioneering iron work associated with them, indicates high skill and specialization. It is unlikely to have been the creation of nomadic smiths or tinkers, though some may have found a place in it. Indeed the activity of such people in the ancient Near East is still obscure;90 where documentary evidence is available metal industries were normally centralized and under careful government supervision.91 The activities of modern travelling tinkers in the area suggest that ancient tinkers belonged primarily to areas where truly nomadic communities were most prevalent, not to areas of settlement, and that they specialized in the production and repair of simple everyday equipment rather than in elaborate and sophisticated metalwork.92 For the moment it may be surmised that the " Liristdn " smiths formed distinct groups in the urban centres of Hulailan, Tarhan and southern Kurdistan. Sources of Ore and Fuel It must be made clear at the outset that the extent to which analyses can contribute to the identifica- tion of the ore sources exploited in antiquity is very contentious. Apart from the methodological prob- lems involved93 such work depends initially on detailed and scrupulous investigation of the native ores, in this case not only of Iran, but of the Near East as a whole. These are not available. For the moment the ancient documentary sources, the location of known deposits of various ores and their geographical proximity to the main centres of production for any particular industry must be carefully correlated to provide answers to this vital preliminary question. As Iran is so rich in the ores vital to a thriving bronze industry it is hardly likely that her local industries were dependent on anything but local supplies. Even more significant for a country in the Near East, where deposits of the ore are scarce, is the occurrence of cassiterite, the only important ore of tin, in close proximity to all the major areas which archaeological evidence has shown were major centres of bronze-working in antiquity: Kara Dagh, west of the Caspian, on the southern slopes of the Elburz near Astardbad and Shahrfid, and probably in the Ktih-i-Bendn in central Iran.94 In the absence of physical and political barriers it may reasonably be assumed that the most accessible source was that most commonly exploited. For Liristan this was the area west of the Caspian where both tin and copper occur, not to mention iron. It was an area with a long established and flourishing metal industry of its own. It would be unwise to ignore completely the possibility that a certain amount of tin, perhaps also copper, worked to the east of Elam, 86 Notably H.

There is a little scattered documentary evidence to suggest that Susa served as a centre for the westward export of tin to Mesopotamia and beyond, regions where cassiterite deposits were virtually unknown;95 but whether the ultimate source of the tin was to the north or east of Susa is obscure. In the earlier second millennium the earliest evidence appears for a trade in tin, probably from the mines east of Tabriz, through the Zagros to Assur and thence south and west.96 Although the distance between Liristdn and the northern mines was considerable, it was not so great as that along which metals travelled to Assur from eastern Anatolia in the early second millen- nium B.C. or booty, often including very considerable quantities of metal, was transported by later Assyrian monarchs.9" Almost certainly, for ease of transport by baggage animals or in carts, the metal would have travelled as ingots cast to standard shapes and sizes. Documentary evidence from Sumer and the Cappadocian trade"98 indicates that metals were usually smelted as close to the mines as possible, where combustible material was generally available. This is largely confirmed by fieldwork in two great mining areas of antiquity in the Near East: the Arabah of Israel and the Caucasus.99 That this was not invariably the case may be seen at Mari, where smelting of selected ores certainly took place;100 but practical considerations, particularly the availability of fuel, must have reduced such activities to a minimum. Another source of raw material for the local bronze founders of Lfristan was provided by broken, worn out or unwanted objects, as well as faulty castings, sent back for reuse. A number of objects which may fall in this category were found by the Danish excavators at Tang-i Hamamlan.11o Bronze founders' hoards have rarely been reported from Near Eastern countries, but a number from Cyprus have been fully published.102 It is of some interest to notice that the contents of the Late Bronze Age wreck off Cape Gelidonya on the south coast of Anatolia suggest that scrap metal was, in certain circumstances, transported over considerable distances as readily as new ingots.103 In antiquity the sole means of obtaining the necessary heat for smelting or melting, casting and soldering the ore was the charcoal fire.104 Bitumen, or other inflammable materials, would not have produced a suitable flame, though for quite small works an oil lamp would have sufficed. Although the problem has yet to be scientifically investigated certain comments in Assyrian records of West Iranian campaigns and the pattern of ancient settlement in Liristin suggest that it was once more forested than it is today, allowing ample scope for charcoal production. The Cast Bronze Tradition: Techniques and Artefacts In the course of excavating the graves in the " Donjon " at Susa de Mecquenem found a variety of stone moulds, normally bivalve. They were primarily for casting arrowheads, spearheads, dagger- blades and pins.105 Only two were published with illustrations,106 one for casting two arrowheads set side by side with a pointed awl between, the other for two arrowheads cast with a common tang and later separated. Their date will only be established when it is possible to examine in more detail the type of weapon cast, since the context covers much of the second millennium B.c. and later. 95 J.

During his soundings on the site Stein'07 found a large pot of partly burnished red ware which contained a variety of bronze objects: a bundle of twenty-nine roughly cast bronze rods, some corroded together, which had been cast in open moulds; eight flat bronze strips, 8 to 12 in. in length; and five small pieces of copper I A in. in length. Close by the vessel were a number of moulds. A large stone-io- x 4 X 21 in.-had moulds for " broad-bladed chisel-like implements " on the wide faces and for ingots on each narrow face.108 Fragments of two stone moulds109 had apertures for ingots on their narrow faces and one may have been a bivalve mould for casting a snaffle-bit, similar to such moulds from south Russia.110 The find is important in illustrating the simultaneous use of open and closed moulds at this time. Analyses of metal objects from Loristan and Dailamn'111 have shown that copper was still in use in the earlier first millennium B.C. for cast objects. Copper is not easy to cast in closed-moulds, but readily dealt with in open moulds and they were clearly retained for casting simple tools and weapons. The method is simple, involves the minimum of labour to make flat axes, sickles, knives, dagger-blades, chisels, etc., and does not demand great skill or experience. It is also relatively fast.'12 The addition of as little as 2 to 3 per cent tin to copper, however, makes it less gaseous and increases the metal's liquidity, which makes casting it in closed moulds easier with a standard tin-bronze of the quality current in Liiristin by the late second millennium B.C. The flange-hilted dirks and daggers from Liristan and elsewhere in western Iran, all of good quality, were cast in simple bivalve moulds to a variety of standard patterns. When the hilt was cast solid in imitation of an ordinary flanged hilt with inlay plates in place a different technique was often used in which the blade was made separately first and the hilt then cast onto it. North-west Iranian weapons of this type, sometimes also reported from Ltiristan, have been metallurgically examined in Sydney,113 with important results. The blade and tang unit were made first, forged to shape by severe hammering at high temperature. The tang was covered with clayey material, in some cases it survives,114 which when dry formed a core for the casting. In this way a better balanced weapon would be made than those with a solid hilt. A hollow mould, the exact shape of the shoulder, grooved hilt and pommel, was then formed round the clay core covering the tang. Into this the liquid metal was poured. The complexity of some pommels suggests that the lost-wax process was used to make at least part of the mould. Light hammer blows around the shoulder and the pommel finished off the hilt; at the same time the blade was finished with repeated hammer blows to work-harden and finish the cutting edge. In some cases sheet gold or silver was used to decorate the hilt,115 more commonly linear decoration was traced after casting with hand-held punches or tracers. In the case of the dirk examined in Sydney the hilt and the blade had different compositions; this discrepancy may indicate either a different origin for the base metals or perhaps independent manufacture of the blade and hilt units. That this is not always the case is shown by the analyses of typologically related weapons tested in Oxford.116 No detailed metallurgical examination of a Liiristan axe-head of the earlier first millennium B.C. is yet available, but certain points are clear from surface inspection. Most of the standard axe types were cast in bivalve moulds, probably of stone or baked clay.117 For those with elaborate plastic decoration the moulds, if only in part, must have been made by the lost-wax process, rather than from actual examples or wooden patterns. Outstanding among the axes reported from the region decorated with three-dimensional zoomorphic motifs are some rare examples with the blade cast as an openwork design of animals.s18 Non-utilitarian or votive axes from the region are common; many apparently practical forms have never had their blades ground down for use.

This is made clear by a number of examples which have not been properly cleaned down after casting.120 The more elaborate heads and terminals were made by the lost wax-process and subsequently cast onto a shank or hoop, sometimes made in a different metal. Many of the most elaborate pinheads are on iron shanks. It is highly skilled three dimensional modelling of zoomorphic cast bronze decoration on whetstone sockets, standard finials, figured tubes, elaborate pinheads and openwork cheekpieces for horsebits which establishes the individuality and great technical skill of Liiristdn's smiths, in a way the other metalwork from the region does not. These were all cored castings by the lost-wax process; a technique of con- siderable antiquity,121 which had been exploited for centuries with particular skill and ingenuity by the Elamites. This method of casting has two supreme advantages well appreciated by the smiths of Liristan: very fine detail can be worked on the model for exact reproduction in casting and any shape of model can be reproduced. Even the most superficial examination of the standard finials indicates how the details were either built-up on the original wax model, which may itself have been made over a clay core, with coils of wax, or cut sharply or punched into the wax. The eye-ridges of the lions illustrate very well the coil technique and the elaborate surface decoration of certain anthropomorphic tubes the cutting technique.122 In the latter case, as with Egyptian and Greek bronzes,123 it is certain that the particularly elaborate decoration was done before, not after, casting. The original would have been cut from a block of hard wax, far harder than was normally used for finger modelling. It is self- evident that only one object with re-entrant curves could be made in a single mould by this process. Thus the finials, though often superficially alike, are never identical and subject to many small variations of detail. Bees-wax in some quantity would inevitably have been required by an industry of this kind. For- tunately evidence for the prevalence of bee-keeping in western Iran in antiquity is not wholly a matter of inference. Strabo describes the bee-hives used in Media and Armenia and comments on the Persian practice of covering their dead with wax; indicative of ample supplies.124 It is also known that bee- keeping, not indigeneous in Mesopotamia, was introduced on at least one occasion, c. 750 B.C., from mountains to the north and east.125 Pliny discusses in detail the preparation of bees-wax, but the most easterly centre of production, so far as Roman interests went, was in Pontus.126 The bee occasionally appears on west Iranian metalwork of the earlier first millennium B.C.127 Although the great majority of cast bronzes with elaborate modelled zoomorphic and anthropo- morphic decoration from Lfiristan were made by the lost-wax process, it is possible that some of the pinheads with bold, openwork designs were made differently. On these the design is often only on one face and no three-dimensional modelling is involved. These pinheads could have been made in a type of open stone mould widely used in the Near East during the second and earlier first millennium B.c. for the production of jewellery, trinkets and flat deity statuettes of various sizes.128 The pin shanks, whether of bronze or iron, were made separately and the heads subsequently cast on.

In many objects cast in open moulds this is obliterated by subsequent grinding to produce a smooth finish. This was not necessary with pins of this type and the remains of the original casting surface sometimes survive on the back.129 The Cast Bronze Tradition: Ores, Alloys and Impurities Ores Apart from the significance of native copper in the earliest phase of metal-working some interest attaches to the more complex problem of identifying its use in later periods, when it has been melted and cast. It is generally agreed, and analysis has largely demonstrated, that native coppers are distin- guished by their purity. But it is also clear that an exceptionally pure copper, closely approaching or even matching the purity of a native metal, may be obtained by smelting an ore such as malachite.130 In these circumstances identification of native copper in these analyses of Liristan Bronzes must be regarded with due caution. Definite information is available on only one source of native copper in Iran. At Talmessi, to the north-east of Isfahan, there are such rich occurrences of primary native copper that any early settlers in the area would have had little difficulty in finding and using the raw material. It is the most likely source for the native copper used by the earliest settlers at Sialk. The Talmessi samples had a relatively high arsenic content with traces of lead, zinc and silver, but apparently not nickel.131 In native coppers from Azerbaijan and Armenia nickel was traced, but not normally arsenic.132 It is possible that native copper, alloyed of course with tin in both cases, was used in the manufacture of the bar cheekpiece for the horsebit of Sialk B type (Analysis No. 3) and the flange- hilted dirk (Analysis No. 37); both objects produced in the ninth or eighth centuries B.C. It is possible, though less likely, that the mouthpiece of the horsebit was also an alloy of native copper and tin (Analysis No. 4).- There is already evidence that in the later second millennium B.C. unalloyed copper was still used in Dailamdn at least for weapons deposited in graves.133 One of the pins with a large disk-shaped head, from Ltiristmn, where they are common in contexts of the eighth and seventh centuries B.C. (Analysis No. 131), is of copper, whilst the other one analysed is a mild tin-bronze (Analysis No. 132). More analyses of these pins are now required to see if copper or bronze was the more usual; copper would be perfectly appropriate, perhaps better even, for this type of pinhead, which was hammered from the top of a single circular-sectioned rod and then decorated with repousse or chased patterns. Two pins with swollen or moulded heads, also of copper, could be earlier (Analysis Nos. 109, I 13). A pair of bracelets in Sydney,134 the mouth piece of a horsebit (Analysis No. 2), one of the harness-rings (Analysis No. 67) and a figured tube (Analysis No. I oo) of the earlier first millennium B.C. with less than 3 per cent tin would, on Coghlan's definition, be classified as accidental bronzes obtained by working an enriched ore, rather than deliberate alloys. Alloys: Tin-bronzes In the majority of the bronzes analysed the tin percentages range between 4 and 13 per cent. Only six objects had higher percentages, to a maximum of 18 - 3 per cent in a bottle-shaped support, whose silver colouring reflects the higher tin content. Witter has shown that the addition of 5 per cent tin to copper greatly increases its hardness; this can be doubled when work-hardened by hammering. The addition of tin, between 5 to 18 per cent, does not produce a proportional increase in hardness as cast, but it is very considerably increased by work-hardening. The hardness again increases with the addition 129 For example, Ashmolean Museum: 1965-799 (Analysis No. 125); 1965.807 (Analysis No. 128). 130 H. H.

It is clear from these analyses that there was little or no attempt at a uniform standard, and pins and finials, for which hardness and strength were not necessarily prime requisites, have equal, if not higher percentages of tin than the tools and weapons. The horsebits are more consistent in having between 5 and Io per cent tin. Impurities: Nickel The most striking feature of these analyses is the regular occurrence of small percentages of nickel, less than about I per cent. This is definitely an inadvertent impurity. Only in three of the artefacts analysed was the nickel percentage higher than this: No. 22: 3'5; No. 109: 18; No. 113: I I per cent. Many ancient bronzes from the Near East and Caucasia contain quantities of nickel generally below I per cent, but rising on occasion to 5 per cent.136 In this context Analysis No. 22 is of some interest. The axe is an arsenical-bronze, closely paralleled at Ur and Susa137 in the third quarter of the third millennium B.C. Its composition may indicate that it is of Elamite or Sumerian manufacture. As nickel was so frequently detected in the third millennium artefacts from Susa and south Mesopotamia which they analysed, the Sumer Copper Committee assumed a copper ore containing nickel as the source of the raw material and devoted considerable research to identifying it. Although nickel is not a particularly common impurity in copper, the Committee was unable to reach any firm conclusions.138 They accumulated a wide range of useful data and suggested that the Jebel Ma'dan deposit, inland from Sohar, in the Wadi Ahin, Oman, had been the primary source for Sumerian copper. Copper lumps from Mohenjo-daro also contained nickel, rising to slightly over I per cent.139 Documentary evidence also indicates that before the Old Babylonian period copper from southern sources was normally used in Sumer.140 Except in the case of the axehead (Analysis No. 22), these conclusions have little relevance to the artefacts from the central Zagros. Even allowing that the nickel content identifies the parent ores of Sumerian bronzes, neither the historical evidence nor geographical probability is in favour of a southern source for the ores used in Ltiristan in the earlier first millennium B.c. Copper ores containing nickel have been found in Armenia and north-east Anatolia. Nickel, normally in comparatively small percentages, has been detected in artefacts from Caucasian sites and in the south-west Caspian area.141 Analyses of weapons from Amlash have made clear that there is a source of nickelferous ore, also containing arsenic, somewhere in the region.142 This is almost certainly the mining area whence Lfiristtn derived its main copper supplies. Arsenic Arsenic is a very common impurity in copper and its presence in virtually all these analyses, below I per cent, is of no great significance. The historical and metallurgical implications of the higher percentages have already been examined and require no further comment here. 135 Cited by H. H.

Birmingham-personal communication about un- published analyses recently done in Sydney.</page><page sequence="14">144 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Lead In considering the percentages of lead found in these bronzes it is important to bear in mind its effect on an alloy. As it produces softness, it is undesirable in any quantity in a metal to be used for tools or weapons, but since it increases the fluidity of the alloy it eases the production of sound castings and is particularly valuable in the manufacture of highly decorated castings. A study of the lead per- centages does not lend much weight either to the view that richly ornamented objects invariably have a higher lead content or that a lead enriched ore was systematically exploited at some period during the main production of bronzes in Lfiristdn in the earlier first millennium B.C. The highest percentages, over I o, occur in two cheekpieces for horsebits, which are almost certainly modern reproductions (Analyses Nos. 10/32, 12), in a decorated tube (Analysis No. 98) and a bottle-shaped support (Analysis No. 72), both of very unusual composition, which may also indicate objects of dubious authenticity. Here as in Analyses Nos. 17, 32, 38 and 99, the lead percentages, between 2 and Io, almost certainly indicate a deliberate addition to facilitate casting, either by the ancient or modern smith. The axe (Analysis No. 38) is of some interest in this connection. It is an early type, probably made in the late third or early second millennium B.C., and the extra lead is certainly to ease casting the animal modelled on the butt; one of the earliest examples of cast zoomorphic decoration from the Zagros and indication that the special metallurgical properties of a leaded alloy were already appreciated. There are, how- ever, many later objects, richly decorated, which do not have significantly higher lead percentages than the weapons. Antimony Only 16 per cent of the objects analysed contained antimony and in only two cases (Analyses Nos. 48, 130) was the percentage high enough to merit comment. Antimony, like arsenic, has a hardening effect on copper, but it is quite suitable for casting and a good temper may be given to cutting-tools by hot forging. Sumerian texts indicate that a metal, which might be antimony (Sis-gan), was added in small quantities to molten copper or bronze prior to the casting of an object,143 in the later third millennium B.C. Antimony appears in bronzes from Mesopotamia and Caucasia144 and Kuftin reports copper with 5-10o per cent antimony in the lowest level of dolmens in north Ossetia.145 It is possible, that the axe (Analysis No. 48), with I - 2 per cent antimony, is an example of the technique described in the Sumerian texts. Its composition is unusual, with almost equal percentages of tin and antimony. As it can be dated to the third quarter of the third millennium B.C.146 it may mark an experimental stage in the development of tin-bronze. The even higher percentage in the pin (Analysis No. 130), which has a zoomorphic bronze head cast onto an iron shank, probably made in the eighth or seventh century B.C., may just reflect the use of an enriched copper ore. Zinc Small percentages of zinc in ancient copper or bronze objects, up to about 2 per cent, may be regarded as natural impurities. In Caucasia for example zinc and copper ores are closely associated and early occurrences of a very low zinc brass were probably due to an accidental inclusion of zinc ore with the copper. The extremely high percentages of zinc in Analyses Nos. 10/32 and 12 are another matter. Seen in the context of the other analyses they are almost certainly to be taken as indicative of a modern forger's brass, despite certain theoretical uncertainties about the significance of zinc in ancient objects.147 The matter is complicated by the present obscurity surrounding the early history of brass, although the methods of the ancients in manufacturing it are now sufficiently well known.148 It is not until the Roman period that objects and documentary evidence unequivocally indicate the existence of brass. These early brasses contain 70-90 per cent copper, O10-30 per cent zinc; the metal 143 H. Limet, op. cit., pp. 55 ff. with full philological discussion. 144 0. Davies, Man (1935) 91, note 13. x45 B.

The commonest modern brasses contain a much higher percentage (30-40) of zinc. There is no obvious reason why the process used by the Romans to produce a copper alloy with the rich yellow colour of a low zinc brass, by heating ground calamine (a zinc ore) with powdered charcoal and small pieces of copper, should not be of greater antiquity. Limet149 has rejected with some justice the old view that the Sumerians were familiar with brass made by the calamine process in the later third millennium B.C. For similar reasons, and until analyses lend force to the suggestion, it is impossible to say whether the " s1v hlb " of the Ras Shamra tablets is indeed brass as Schaeffer suggested.150 The Pseudo-Aristotle attributes the discovery of brass to the Mossy- noeci, who lived in Turkey south of Trebizond, in an area rich in zinc, in the early first millennium B.c. The same ancient source relates that Darius had a cup which appeared to be of gold, but had an unpleasant smell; perhaps a low zinc brass. Analysis of Achaemenian metal bowls which had a golden colouring has shown them to be bronzes with io to 12 per cent tin and no appreciable trace of zinc.151 However, analysis of fibulae from Gordion and other bronze objects from Altintepe in Anatolia has shown that zinc, over o0 per cent in the fibulae, appears not uncommonly in objects, almost certainly of local manufacture, made at least as early as the seventh century B.c.152 The status of cheekpieces 1951.194 (Analyses Nos. 10/32) and 1951.195 (Analysis No. 12) must for the moment remain an open question, since the analyses of objects from Anatolia offer positive grounds for thinking that these cheekpieces might be ancient low zinc brasses, perhaps designed to simulate gold. If the zinc criterion is then equivocal in significance, forgeries will prove as difficult to detect metallurgically as they are to isolate with confidence on stylistic grounds,153 since ingenious forgers use fragments of inferior or broken ancient bronzes to make more attractive pieces, rendering their work virtually immune from detection by analysis. The only published analysis of a definite forgery was reported to contain 84"7 per cent copper, 14. 69 per cent tin, o*26 per cent arsenic, traces of silver and iron, but none of antimony, lead, zinc, nickel or cobalt.154 The comparatively small number of these bronzes in which zinc was traced in relatively small percentages include a pair of fibulae analysed in Sydney,155 which are unlikely to have been manu- factured in Lfiristdn, even if actually found there. Fibulae reached western Iran late in the period of maximum production in the Laristdn workshops and are rarely reported with certain provenance from the area. The straight pin was extremely common until the late seventh century B.C. in the region. In the north some of the earliest fibulae appear to have close Caucasian affinities. Those fibulae which have been reported from Lfristdn are generally typical Western Asiatic types with a very wide distribu- tion156 and bear no traces of the distinctive local styles of decoration. They are probably imports from Assyrian or eastern Anatolian workshops. But, as the other objects include decorated finials and tubes, characteristic of Liristin, as well as the body of a sheetmetal vessel with a cast bronze handle in the same style as the finials, it is certain that an ore with zinc in it was used in the region. Zinc was not found in the Arghana ore examined by the Sumer Committee,157 but zinc occurs in artefacts from Talish,158 Dailamdn,159 and Amlash,160 as well as from Caucasian sites.161 Thus northern ore was probably the source of the small quantities of zinc in Liristin bronzes. The Groups The number of analyses so far available is too small to warrant detailed statistical analysis at this stage, particularly in view of the uncertain attribution of certain bronzes. The overall picture presented by the analyses now to hand is, however, seen more clearly if they are broadly grouped by impurities. 149 H.

The Sheetmetal Tradition The creation of the richly decorated cast bronze objects so characteristic of LSiristdn c. 850o-650 B.c. is a modeller's or sculptor's art, the decoration of sheetmetal is by contrast a draughtsman's art. This need not necessarily mean separate workshops or even different specialist craftsmen. Indeed sheetmetal vessels with cast fittings and the stylistic affinities between cast and sheetmetal decoration indicate that single workshops, if not single craftsmen, produced both. The main distinction is an historical one. Whereas the cast bronze tradition of Liiristin is very localized,162 the sheetmetal work is part of a much wider West Iranian tradition of metalworking. To the north there is nothing like the range of technical skill and variety of artefacts in decorated cast bronze which there is in Loiristan, but the range of sheetmetal work, often in gold or silver, is much greater. Certain elements in the decorated sheet- metal work associated with Liristin, notably the large group of decorated situlae,163 are distinct and their history and cultural affinities, primarily Babylonian, are now reasonably clear. In contrast the origin of the decorative style used on a series of sheet bronze quiver plaques, belts, disk-headed pins and vessels, many associated with the Dum Surkh shrine, is still obscure. There is some indication that the immediate source of this style in the ninth and eighth centuries B.c. was to the north of Liristin, where 162 So long as the exact relation to Elam in the earlier first millen- nium B.C. is unknown. 163 P.

Amandry, Antike Kunst 9 (1966), pp. 57 f.-</page><page sequence="17">PREHISTORIC COPPER AND BRONZE METALLURGY IN WESTERN IRAN 147 similar styles of decoration appear on artefacts found at Ziwiyeh and IHasanli,164 and on uncontexted sheetmetal objects in precious metals.165 Indeed, certain decorated objects of gold and silver, reported as from Loiristan, may well have been made to the north, where these metals were more commonly used. In both areas the actual rendering of the design was done in the same way. The relief designs on flat pieces of metal were worked from behind, normally not to an excessive height. The designs on metal vessels were generally worked from the front. The linear designs were chased on the surface with a slightly blunt instrument. The metal originally filling the groove was displaced, not removed, indicating that the technique of engraving was not used. As the metal is normally thin and a ridge appears on the underside of the completed piece it was clearly worked whilst resting on a yielding surface. The absence of engraving in Liristan is not surprising, for, according to Maryon's experiments, the engraving of bronze with bronze tools would never have been a practical proposition.166 The bronze-worker would not have wasted his time in trying to engrave with inadequate tools when he could so easily have chased the design. On a fine silver goblet, now in Cleveland,167 the artist partially set out his design in a series of pointilli dots, evidently as a guide to fitting the figures into the available space. In the final stages he made significant modifications. There is virtually no trace of mechanical aids in the laying out of designs. On the great majority of disk-headed pins the designs are very roughly laid out and clearly executed freehand without careful preparation. Although hammering and annealing was the only method by which sheetmetal could be manu- factured in antiquity, the metal could be worked down until it was smooth and a thickness of even less than o*5 mm. was sometimes achieved from thick copper or bronze sheets cast in open moulds. Of the three sheetmetal objects from Lfiristmn, probably all made in the eighth century B.c., analysed in Oxford, one was copper (Analysis No. 131), two were of bronze (Analyses Nos. Iola, 132). Most of the sheetmetal vessels reported from Liristin were made, either by sinking or raising, from a single sheet. They are almost always of uniform thickness and of a relatively simple form. Handles and spouts of beaten metal were secured to the body of the vessel with rivets; usually split rivets with domed sheet- metal head. Certain seams were folded and hammered, sometimes sealed with an adhesive to make them water-tight. Cast attachments68s are not common and when they appear may well reflect northern influences.'69 Inlay is rarer still, but not unknown. White shell or limestone inlays set in bitumen serve as eyes on the female faces worked in high relief set at the centre of sheetmetal disks. This technique was used on the zoomorphic situla from I;asanlfl.o70 Disk-headed pins were occasionally inlaid with carnelian strips."'7 CONCLUSIONS This paper has dealt briefly and sketchily with but one aspect of a very complex problem. It cannot then be used to draw general conclusions about the cultural history of Lairistdn, only to indicate certain possibilities which emerge when the metalwork of the region is considered in its wider metallurgical context. It has been necessary to assume, without detailed argument, certain basic facts about the typology and iconography of the " Lfiristan Bronzes " which have only become apparent through systematic study in the last decade or so. This would be inexcusable were many of them not already available in print in books and articles by, among others, Calmeyer,172 Deshayes173 and Potratz.174 For thousands of years, with but a brief interlude in the earlier first millennium B.C., the metal work- shops of Lfiristin differed very little in the methods they used and the artefacts they produced from the 164 A.

Throughout the second millennium B.C. relations with the south and west are clear and unequivocal, though the mechanics of them may not always be easily explained with present evidence. Then, apparently rather suddenly, in the very late second or early first millennium B.C., their repertoire was greatly augmented to include artefacts so far unknown elsewhere and others, which though known elsewhere, are never found with the elaborate cast bronze decoration they have in Lfiristan. This industry flourished for about 200 years and was then totally eclipsed. Nomadic intruders or migrating Iranians are normally invoked to explain this remarkable episode; the true explanation is probably not so simple. There are reasons for thinking that this development was fundamentally a local one; a resurgence of indigenous traditions under particularly favourable economic and political conditions which followed the eclipse of Elamite power. If for no other reason, the very fact that such an industry did not develop during Iron Age II further north strongly suggests that its distinctive character owed little or nothing to the intrusive Iranians. Its anonymous patrons may have been mounted warriors fresh to the region-that remains to be demonstrated-but it is already clear that the smiths they employed were steeped in much older, more local, traditions of iconography and craftsmanship. 175 Ceramic evidence from the region at this time reflects exactly the same cultural affiliations, see R.
