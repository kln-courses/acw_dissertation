SUBJECT HEADINGS OF THE GODS In the course of cataloging and searching with the RLIN system, ambiguities and unclear technical points can appear when least expected. Recently ? came across an interesting case in point: Which is the correct RLIN tag for the proper name of a deity, S APN or SASU (MARC 600 or 650)? Does it matter if the deity in question is anthropomorphic or not? A search of the CDF records reveals that opinions do vary. Most deities in a random sampling were tagged as topical subject headings (SAS?) and included both anthropomorphic and zoo morphic gods and goddesses: Athena (11148845F), Aphrodite and Demeter (both 14686171U), Hermes (3850013AC), Horus (16169360S), Apis (6152562Q), Adonis, Attis and Onris (all 7037180G). Three Greek deities were tagged as personal name subject added entries (SAPN): Apollo (36259990Q), Zeus and his sister/wife Hera (both 14627515BK). To add to the confusion, four deities were tagged as both SAPN and SASU: Isis (16291077FF and 16390679DS), the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl (14155397J and 12987212BK), and the Hindu gods Vishnu (14690284DP and 2058146S) and Krishna (12009431BK and 8931917BJ). How unsettling to find Isis tagged as both a personal name and a topic while her brother/ husband Osiris merits only topical treatment. Zeus and Hera fared much better at the hands of RLIN! The RLIN Data Elements Dictionary is certainly vague when it states the use of the tag SAPN: "Used to record a personal name subject added entry. This includes: names of actual persons capa ble of authorship (including all biblical characters except God and the Devil); names of persons used w th the phrase 'in fiction, drama, poetry, etc.'; and names of families (p. 384 Rev. 6/25/79)." Who is to judge whether the biblical Adam is any more capable of authorship than the Egyptian deity Thoth, who in certain ancient texts is attributed with the authorship of the Am Duat or Book of That Which Is in the Netherworld, a Library of Congress uniform title! Biblical characters are admittedly not all historical figures. Why then should Noah, whose origin can be traced in several Ancient Near Eastern mythologies, receive an S?PN tag while his Mesopotamian counterpart, Utnapishtim, would not? Perhaps some cultural chauvinism is at work here. While performing my random search for names of deities I was struck by the unsatisfactory results from a personal name search such as "fin pn krishna." This name is very common among present-day Indian authors, so the search becomes tedious and inefficient. As noted above, the god Krishna is found both as a personal name subject added entry and as a topical subject head ing, so all relevant titles will not be located unless both searches are made, A similar experience can be found with Hermes. At this point it becomes clear that the qualifications for an SAPN tag must be made more specific, both for the peace of mind of the cataloger and for efficient searching in the RLIN system. It would seem logical to confine the SAPN tag to actual living or historical personages; mythological, fictional, and supernatural personages and beings should all be tagged with SASU. This would avoid the taint of cultural and religious chauvinism while provid ing a uniform arrangement for efficient searching. The command "fin s krishna" would then yield a complete result without requiring a second search as a personal name, thereby avoiding confusion with names of authors. Edward K. Werner Egyptian Library Project The Metropolitan Museum of Art AACR 2 Institute Two-hundred sixty-eight librarians registered to attend thp AACR 2 Institute which was held in New York City on May 29-31, 1980. Most of them were from New York, New Jersey, Connecti cut, and Massachusetts, but some came from as far away as Flor ida, Wyoming, and California. They came to New York for a three-day conference on the Library of Congress' interpretation of AACR 2. The Institute was organized by the Library of Congress for the Resources and Technical Services Division and its Council of Regional Groups. Its objective was "to provide background for understanding the Library of Congress interpretation and applica tion of the code." Because of the large number of registrants, they were divided into four groups with Institute leaders lecturing each group on their respective topics of expertise. The opening and closing gen eral sessions brought all the participants together in one large group. Mr. Robert M. Hiatt, Assistant to the Director for Catalog ing, opened the session with a brief survey on the history of the catalog code revision, and explained the structure of the AACR 2 rules. He brought the session to a close with a review of AACR 2, and plans for implementation at the Library of Congress. The speakers from LC were well prepared, cordial, and most willing to respond to questions, as time permitted. The conference was well organized and moved along smoothly. I had hoped that the Institute would have been more of a hands-on, illustrated, laboratory-type workshop on AACR 2; but it fell short regarding this. I had also hoped that there would be more time for questions, analysis, and sample catalog copy. There was little time to ques tion, analyze, and introduce cataloging problems and/ or resolve them. Basically, the program was an A/V presentation and verbaliza tion of the AACR 2. When interpretation in cataloging was pre sented other than that illustrated in AACR 2, the format was fragmented like the text. While there were a few instances where the complete cataloging was screened, from main entry to tracings, there was little time to copy the samples, and the hand-out litera ture given to each registrant lacked such necessary illustrations. Mr. Hiatt stated in the opening session the known fact that AACR 2 rules were designed for general libraries, whereas AACR rules were more suited for research libraries. However, AACR 2 gives more freedom to the cataloger to exercise his/her judgment "if appropriate, necessary, etc." LC will leave decisions to be made by its cata?ogers, but where consistency is necessary, interpretation will be provided in the Bulletin. Also, the options provided by AACR 2 give each library the choice of deciding when to use the alternative rules: always, sometimes, or never. Examples illustrating rules in AACR 2 should not be taken as substitutes for the rule. Neither do they necessarily reflect LC's application (e.g., some geographical names). Here are some of the examples where LC's application differs from the AACR 2 rules: AACR 2 rule 24.5 omits initial articles only when they are not required for grammatical reasons, e.g., Der blaue Adler (Associa tion). The Library of Congress will delete initial articles in all access fields except in the title proper. It will, however, retain the</page><page sequence="2">ARLIS/NA Newsletter, October 1980 169 initial article in the bibliographic description. The LC heading will be Blaue Adler (Association); that means do not change to Blauer Adler, but simply omit the article. Another change from AACR 2 concerns the spacing and punc tuation of personal names headings in which two or more fore names are represented by initials. LC will leave a single space between initials, e.g., Eliot, T. S. (Thomas Stearns), 1888-1965 (AACR 2 does not leave a space between initials in name head ings). Corporate name intitials in headings and other areas will not be separated with a space, e.g., W.W. Morrow Foundation. AACR 2 rule 23.2A states that the English form should be used for geographic names. LC recommends the following: verify places in the United States in the most recent edition of the Rand McNally Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide. For other names use the form approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. When ever BGN approves both a vernacular and an English form, use the English form. When BGN approves only the vernacular form check to see if there is an equivalent English form listed by LC, and if so use it, e.g., use LowerSaxony instead of Niedersachsen, Sicily instead of Sicilia, etc., but use Zaragoza instead of Sargossa (the English form of the name is not used anymore). The library community should be informed of the Institute's offerings as they occur acrss the U.S. I feel that the Institute, as presented, would benefit non-catalogers and other librarians or staff with limited cataloging experience. For catalogers, however, it is essential because of the need to grasp LCs interpretation of AACR 2 before January 2, 1981. Such interpretations form the basic part of the Institute's program. Additionally, the ARLIS/NA conference in San Francisco, in its workshop on A ACR 2 rules, will provide a more practical setting for the further clarification and application of these rules in the day-to-day work of catalogers. Donya Schimansky Metropolitan Museum of Art ROUND ROBIN And for now the accumulated nitty-gritty: A While LC was correct in giving an entry for only the first place of exhibition (Boston. Museum of Fine Arts) to Pompeii A.D. 79: Treasures from the National Archaeological Museum, Naples, and the Pompeii Antiquarium (LC 78-54015) shouldn't there also be entries for the two museums that loaned the works in the exhibition? A The book Warp-Patterned Weaves of the Andes by Ann Pollard Rowe (Washington, D.C: Textile Museum, 1977) (LC 77-73936), while not apparent from the title page, is a "catalogue [which] actually includes more material than it was possible to place on exhibition." Shouldn't such "expanded catalogs" have an added entry for the museum? Since LC accepted the shared cataloging for the exhibition catalog 7 hollaendische Kuenstler, Kunstmuseum Luzern, the title (taken from the title page) appears as Douwe Jan Bakker, Jeroen Henneman, Pieter Holstein...[the names of the first 3 artists listed] while the actual title is given as other title information. The title should have been taken from the cover of the catalog where the names of the artists are given in a different order?a clear indica tion that their names do not comprise the title. (LC 76-479522) A There were two responses to the question about how to formu late two additions to the name of a corporate body (May 1980 Newsletter, p. 88)?conflicting responses, naturally. Both responses drew parallels to other rules and examples. If the rule for types of jurisdictions (24.6B, e.g., Cork (Ireland: County)) or for churches (24.I0B, e.g., St. James' Church (Manhattan: Catholic)) is chosen as the model, the parallel form is Angela Flowers (Lon don: Gallery); if the rule for radio and television stations (24. IIA, e.g., HVJ (Radio Station: Vatican City)) is chosen, the parallel form is Angela Flowers (Gallery: London). A new contest has been suggested: the "Absurd-subject heading-of-the-month-award." The current nominated heading is: "Municipal powers and services beyond corporate limits." The heading may be long but it is also direct. Any suggestions? A Is anyone bothered by the dual nature of "...in art" headings? Most of them are used for representation of something (usually, but not always, concrete) in the actual work of art, e.g., "Trees in art." Others are used for describing an aspect of the art itself, e.g., the now-defunct "Symbolism in art" or "Parody in art" (LCSH, 1978 suppl.). The latter heading, presumably, is used for works of art that are parodies or contain parodies. Wouldn't headings such as "Parodies (Music)" (LCSH, 8th ed.) be better for this type of material? A Does anyone have solutions to the problem of subject headings for reproductive art, copy art, reproduction, reproducing art, etc.? The Art Institute of Chicago uses the heading "Prints, Reproduc tive" rather than LCs "Prints" plus "Art?Reproduction" for works such as Bilder nach Bildern: Druckgrafik und die Vermit tlung von Kunst (LC76-481955) or "Painters and Engraving: the Reproductive Print from Hogarth to Wilkie" (an exhibition of the Yale Center for British Art). A The list of "Revised Headings for 1981" published in Cataloging Service Bulletin no. 8 includes the heading "Brooklyn Museum of Art." This heading is incorrect; it should be "Brooklyn Museum." The revised heading will appear (has appeared?) in CSB no. 9. A An example of a non-specific chronological subdivision, "Painting, Chinese?Ming-Ch'ing dynasties, 1368-1912," appears as the subject tracing for "Pacificulture-Asia Museum, tanmese painting: the last 100 years...[1974] (LC 79-314474)." Does anyone have an explanation for the use of Chinese dynasties as chronologi cal subdivisions or suggestions for a better system? A A clarification from the ICOMOS International Secretariat: "ICOMOS means the International Council on Monuments and Sites. The on was adopted, instead of the /...in 1969." A The J. Paul Getty Museum submitted the following (LC 79 127545): Thuro, Catherine M V Primitives &amp; folk art: our handmade heritage / by Catherine Thuro; [photography and design by Catherine M.V. Thuro; cover, Optima Medium]..., cI97Q "We figure her [Optima Medium] to be about 5'6", a little on the heavy side, mousey hair, etc., not at all like her flashy friend, Optima Bold."</page></plain_text>
