<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART FORMS AND SCIENCE CONCEPTS A NOTE ON THE SOCIAL FUNCTIONING OF ABSTRACTIONS ART forms and science concepts originate in a process of ab- straction, a process which, while dependent upon individuals, is a group phenomenon. In their studies of pre-literate, relatively homogeneous societies, the social anthropologists have found that upon that level of culture there exists little differentiation of func- tions: all arts and sciences are socially orientated, all aspects of behavior are interrelated, and are a part of the same matrix of custom and tradition. A member of such a society, binding to- gether logs for a raft, is engaged at once in an art, a science, an economic, and a religious activity. These are unseparated functions. If, however, some one aspect of the man's interest comes to predominate over any or all others; if, for example, he becomes, and others following him become, more interested in the form, the pearance of the raft, that interest may continue beyond the moment of actual construction or evolvement with the material: he may then arrive at the point of seeing the form apart from the actual construction and draw the raft upon the sand,-mold it in clay, or fashion it out of a piece of wood. When for the first time a shape, color, or sound is conceived as existing independently of any actual concrete object, art makes its first appearance out of the originally undifferentiated matrix which constitutes the cultural pattern of homogeneous society. A similar event gives rise to the use of language as we know it. The belief in the magic power of words represents either an early unseparated stage or its vestigial remains. When the word and the thing are felt to be co-extensive, language has not become suffi- ciently abstract to be of much use. The moment when the word is dissociated from the thing, a new possibility of language use is available. Similarly, when the notions of weight, measure, quan-</page><page sequence="2">ART FORMS AND SCIENCE CONCEPTS 483 tity, number are realized as things apart from embodiment in particular concretions, something akin to science has begun. That such departures are likely still to be impregnated with other aspects of life, say the religious, during the early stages of the process (and in later stages and, perhaps, as we shall see, always) does not alter the fact that some kind of division, a degree of abstraction, has been achieved. And this achievement represents the beginning of the development of the arts and sciences as relatively independent or "pure" fields of study and endeavor, as well as the beginning of the society's development into the stage of a heterogeneous culture.' All of us arrive in a world already organized, arranged, ordered. For most of us the prevailing pattern is more or less satisfactory; it does with reasonable accuracy reflect our individual relations with the group and with the world. But not quite! Because there is no definite pattern; always it is in process of slight, almost imper- ceptible, change. But it is changing, and that change is the re- flection of each individual's slight modification of the pattern from one period to another.2 Whether the individual modifies the pattern in terms of paint on canvas, words in poetry, in marble, in mathe- matics, in terms of the physical or social sciences, in economic, -political, or religious practices, depends upon all the factors which make up the particular individual in his particular society. All of us are taking part in the process daily; but our individual percep- tions, and our individual responses, are not intense enough, or our ability to achieve a statement of our own response is too feeble to effect important revisions in the pattern. Only the rare individual makes much of a dent in the pattern. But, however the modification is made, if it is made in either the arts or sciences, we have here the genesis of a modification of what we term "forms and concepts." And as forms and concepts have similar origins, so their histories are similar. The slight modifica- 1 In connection with this interpretation of the process of increasing abstrac- tion, Alfred J. Toynbee's concept of "etherialization" as the means by which societies advance to higher levels presents interesting parallels; see A Study of History, esp. Vol. III. See, also, A. N. Whitehead's various works of which An Introduction to Mathematics presents the simplest exposition of the process of abstraction in a special field. A. Irving Hallowell's monograph, "Some Psycho- logical Aspects of Measurement Among the Saulteaux " in the American Anthro- pologist, N. S. Vol. 44 (1942), pp. 66-77, offers interesting data on a special aspect studied in a pre-literate society. 2 I employ the terms "pattern " and "cultural pattern" in the singular for convenience, but recognize that a configuration of cultural patterns more nearly describes any contemporary complex society. See Ralph Linton: The Study of Man, N. Y., 1936, for an account of cultural patterns which, in general, is pre- supposed in this paper.</page><page sequence="3">484 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tion is accepted by others who, in turn, modify it slightly, extend it, elaborate it, find broader applications and uses for it until gradually the older pattern is more or less completely changed within a greater or lesser part of the whole society. FORMS In an address to the Sorbonne, Juan Gris, the Spanish painter said: . . . la seule possibility de la peinture est 1'expression de certains rapports du peintre avec le monde ext6rieur et . . . le tableau est l'association intime de ces rapports entre eux et entre eux. ...3 The painting is a statement of the relationship between the external world, the "given," the "real" in some of its aspects which, whether still-life, landscape, or persons, we shall call the "object," and the painter whose response is conditioned by his group's pattern of visual forms and his own psychophysical reactions to that pattern and to the world. As the individual develops within the cultural pattern of the group and comes to see the world much as his fellows do, so within the specialized field of an art, in this instance painting, he learns to see and to paint much as do others of his time and place. He learns the technical procedures, that is to say, is introduced into the prevailing pattern of technics common to the group. Yet for all the similarity that exists among men, there are so many variables involved that while all see similarly and may even paint similarly, the likelihood of exact similarity in the finished product is infinitesi- mal. The variations, however slight, constitute the element which differentiates one individual from another-the individual style. Within any one group-" school,"-however, the likenesses are more striking than the variations; as a group, they see the world in terms of a certain pattern of visual forms. Form in painting is the pictorial pattern of structural relations as exhibited in a painting. In an obvious way we all recognize this. We are all familiar with such commonly accepted terms as "class- ical," used in reference to Greco-Roman art, or "Gothic," used in reference to the arts of the middle ages. What these terms indicate is a certain orderly arrangement of the elements out of which the art products are made. What is made may differ enormously: from a miniature to a cathedral; each may, moreover, suggest the style of an individual or small group of artists. For all that, we can abstract from these finished art products certain structural relation- ships which they have in common, a form which we denominate as, 3 "Des Possibilit6s de la Peinture," the transatlantic review, Paris, Vol. II, (1924), p. 79.</page><page sequence="4">ART FORMS AND SCIENCE CONCEPTS 485 for example, "Gothic." So each social or cultural group in each cultural period develops its own forms, and these forms are indica- tive of the way the group reacts to its world. In all ages we are all of us looking at a world which is, we presume, much the same world; how we are looking is revealed by the forms our reports take; these reveal our reaction to the object. A landscape by Nicolas Poussin, another by Monet, a third by Cezanne might all conceivably have been painted from the same object (though the way of looking may also to some extent deter- mine the choice of object); but the way in which each of the three artists looked is revealed by the difference in the form in which each recorded what he saw. The first presents us with a maj estic con- ception; the second, with a brilliant, scintillating glimpse; the third, with an integrated pattern of abstractions. Each of these men had sufficient individuality, sufficient style to differentiate his works from those of any other artists of the same period. But there were literally hundreds of other paintings during the same periods which presented us with similar forms: maj estic conceptions were a com- monplace of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; brilliant, scintillating glimpses were equally common in the mid- nineteenth century; while the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have produced an infinite number of integrated patterns of abstractions. These are inadequate descriptions of these forms; but they are descriptions of forms and indicate the common de- nominator, the social reaction, of each period. We are treating of forms, and the meaning of the term requires, perhaps, a little further elucidation. Just as we have become accustomed to distinguishing between esthetic, scientific, and other "fields," so we have become accustomed in our complex society to a separation of "form" and "content." The distinction is at once valuable and meaningless. Before discussing its value, which we shall return to later, we must note how meaningless in one sense it is. Form without content, or content without form, is purely imaginary. There are no grins without cats, no lips without form, no forms of nothing. In any real sense form includes a content necessarily. In considering form in the arts, however, we are often confused by what "content" means. Materially, the content of a painting is so many ounces of various paints and a piece of canvas. That, obviously, is not what we always mean-particularly when we object to the use of form as a criterion; and yet that is what we mean by " content " when we say above that there is no form without content. But again let us insist that there is no content apart from form: the picture is a construct made of paints distributed in such and such a manner, and the way the paints are distributed, the</page><page sequence="5">486 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY kind of paints used, etc., constitutes the form. As the patterned response of the painter, the picture is a construct which may be related more or less closely to some object in the external world-as the triangle of the geometer may more or less closely approximate some object in the external world. There is, however, no more reason that a painter should reproduce a specific form than there is that the geometer should always work with imperfect triangles because perfect triangles are difficult, if not impossible, to find in the "natural" world. The real separation of "form" and "content" is made by the artist as soon as he begins to work in a medium. Paint a tree upon the canvas as "realistically" as he can, the painter has in the act separated form from content because he has made his tree out of paint, not out of wood; he has separated the original form from its original content. As the scientist studies a certain form, let us say "oscillation," studying it apart from any particular content, so the artist studies forms apart from their particular contents. Too often what we mean by "content" in a work of art is what I have called the "object": the still-life, landscape, or persons. But the object in the painting is no longer the object of the external world: it is a formal presentation in terms of color, mass, lines, etc., of the forms of the external world as seen by one man at one time and place. The picture represents one way of ordering the visual elements into some kind of pattern. Verbal language is one of man's greatest inventions. The nature of this invention can most easily be shown by the criticisms made of it. To the mystic and emotionalist, it is a source of despair: there are no words which will adequately express their feelings; it is too objective in connotation, too logical. To the realist and scientist, it is equally a source of despair: there are no words not tinged with feeling, emotion; it is too anthropomorphic, too subjective. But the despair of the mystic and scientist is the glory and genius of language to the artist in words. For literature is "a dialogue between life and the world," an expression of the rela- tionship of emotion and object, of the imaginative and the real. Wishing to indicate why a newspaper report of events is not fine literature, Gertrude Stein said: When the outside is entirely outside, that is, is not inside, then it is not at all inside, and so it is not existing. [My punctuation.] 4 In other words, as Juan Gris suggested, the response of the artist is required before we have a work of art. Miss Stein's definition of Narration by Gertrude Stein, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Ill., 1935, p. 39.</page><page sequence="6">ART FORMS AND SCIENCE CONCEPTS 487 genius as the ability "to talk and listen at the same time" is simply another way of saying: establishing relations between the individual and the world, the inside and the outside. However, in the above quotation Miss Stein was really dividing the sheep from the goats of literature. Any conglomeration of words falls within the possible boundaries of the art. Not even the most unlikely of compositions-newspaper reports, municipal ordinances, casual letters-can be denied; "nor is it valid," as Marianne Moore writes: to discriminate against "business documents and school-books"; all these phenomena are important. One must make a distinction however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not poetry, nor till the poets among us can be "literalists of the imagination "-above insolence and triviality and can present for inspection, imaginary gardens with real toads in them, shall we have it.6 The one boundary of the art is the literally repeated structural word form, where nothing is felt by the writer but where he is merely imitating the cultural verbal pattern rather than reacting himself to some aspect of the world. The other boundary is the completely unformed, where all is emotion and the verbal pattern is neglected, ignored, or not known. Examples of either extreme are almost non-existent, but there are numerous examples that approach one or the other. All mechanical imitations: "business documents and school books," most political speeches, "populariza- tions," etc., approach, and often seem to achieve, the first; the ravings of lunatics, the hysterics of the mystics, various abracadabra approach, and often seem to achieve, the other. It will be observed that these two boundaries represent an extreme dominance of, respectively, the social form and the indi- vidual style, and that either represents a kind of failure. Yet rarely, if ever, will there be an exact equality in the proportion of the two elements. Generally, as we should expect, the cultural verbal form will clearly dominate. But it is just as important to realize that the individual modification is inevitably present as it is to recognize that the cultural pattern is predominant in the work of art. 6 From "Poetry" in Selected Poems of Marianne Moore, The Macmillan Co., N. Y., 1935, pp. 35-36.</page><page sequence="7">488 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Our distinction between form and style in a work of art is, of course, partially arbitrary. Form and style are interrelated and modify each other. The artist, working within a given form, by the intensity of his relationship with the object will, in a very real sense, recreate the form-and only when this happens do we, in Miss Moore's phrase, "have it." But these recreations (note the double meaning of this word) are often but the slightest of modifica- tions, and the form in a general way remains common property. An illustration will point the distinction. Anyone sensitive to words can distinguish between Dryden's heroic couplets and Pope's. The first have a kind of massive strength while the latter are brittle; the first have a blundering force while the latter having biting precision; the first are majestic, while the latter are elegant. Each writer impressed his individuality to some degree upon the form; but the difference is inherent in the styles. How many writers used the heroic couplet during the same period to no purpose! One can say only that they wrote in the form. That is a deficiency of style, a deficiency of individuality. Repetition of the verbal cultural form is never purely mechanical; that is an impossibility for any but a robot. But the difference is usually negligible; the contribution of the individual is insufficient to raise the form above the generic. Without that, the form itself is meaningless. But the form is the element, so far as one can make a distinction at all, which many artists may have in common, which many artists do have in common in any given age. As the style is individual, the form is social. The historian of the arts inevitably traces the history of forms because forms are the result of social development: an influence here, a variation there, and the final statement can hardly be credited to any individual: it appears so logical a conclusion. The relation between the individual artist and the form he works in defines the relationship of the artist to the social group. It must not be supposed that by form in literature one means anything as limited as, let us say, the heroic couplet. There are forms and forms. Poetry is a form of words,6 the heroic couplet is a form of verse, but so is a word a form, so is a sentence a form, so is a paragraph. And any of these may change and do change from age to age, from one social group to another, and in the way they are used. Form is a generic term and is comprised of all the structural elements out of which anything is made. 6Like most statements about forms today, this should be considerably qualified, though it is conventionally accepted. I have touched on the subject in "Forms of Imaginative Prose: 1900-1940," The Southern Review, Vol. VII (1942), pp. 755-775.</page><page sequence="8">ART FORMS AND SCIENCE CONCEPTS 489 CONCEPTS All of the sciences, whether physical or social, depend upon the use of concepts; and concepts are inescapably related with what we have termed "forms" in the arts. Both forms and concepts are constructs, arising from our response to the objects or events of the external world; both are statements of relationships between the external world and the experience of a cultural group; both are subject to development and refinement; the simplest concept, as the simplest form, is the word. Again we must emphasize that even the simplest societies of men have concepts of some kind, and that anyone born into any society learns to think in terms of the concepts of his group. The "climate of opinion" of a time and place represents the elaboration of certain basic concepts which the members of the society generally accept-this is the conceptual aspect of the cultural pattern. There will be variations within this conceptual pattern; it will undergo constant elaboration and modification. Ordinarily, however, the modifications are relatively slight. The principal revelation made by recent studies in the history of science is that the apparently great advances made by men of outstanding genius actually repre- sent slight modifications achieved by many men over long periods of time, and that the slow modifications accumulate until a kind of turning point is attained-often simultaneously by several scientists of genius working independently. The response of the individual to his perceptual experiences takes place then within the conceptual pattern of his culture. When he finds some experience which is inadequately accounted for by his conceptual pattern, he attempts to modify that pattern by making some variation in one or more of the concepts entertained by his cultural group. The modification often employs the same word, but alters what we term its "meaning": that is, the relation between the individual and the object. "Atom" is not defined by the contemporary physicist in the manner in which it was defined by Lucretius. We therefore define the concept as a construct, a statement evolved by an individual in response to an object or event which by the structural relations of its contents, i.e., words, defines the "rapports" of that individual with that object or event. The process of elaboration of the concept, its development and refine- ment by others, is its social history. Just as the form is developed, imitated, refined by "schools" in the arts, so the concept is de- veloped, refined, imitated by groups of scientists, less frequently termed "schools," but more usually known by the sign-word used to designate the basic concept, as "evolutionists," " relativists," etc. The concept, like the form, is an abstraction from the concrete</page><page sequence="9">490 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY object or event. As in the instance of "oscillation" already cited, the concept neglects the specific "content" of the concrete object which behaves in that particular manner and any statement about "oscillation" has meaning only in terms of its new "content," i.e., the construction of words forming the statement. This sug- gests the reason for the difficulty experienced by the mathematical physicist in "interpreting" the theory of relativity to the layman. That theory, which is an elaboration of certain basic mathematical concepts, has been stated in the terms of mathematical equations. In other words, the very structure of meaning depends upon the mathematical symbols which is its "content." And to "interpret" or " explain" necessitates substituting verbal language symbols for mathematical symbols, resulting in an alteration of the "con- tent," an alteration which, as the physicist realizes only too clearly, alters some aspect of the relationships he has been at great pains to delimit and express explicitly in his equations. To only a lesser degree the same thing occurs in translations from the verbal language of one social group (the French) to that of another (the English). Again, as with the form, whether or not the concept will closely correspond to the object or event of reference as the latter exists in a pattern of relationships in the external world (be " true " in the usual meaning) is a matter of more and less. The probability is that to some degree it will: it is as inconceivable that our response to the object conceptually should be entirely without objective reference as it is that any formal expression should be wholly with- out such reference; however, it is quite as improbable that any of our "rapports" with the object should be entirely free from the "distortions" of our individual and cultural situation as it is that any art construct should be. In the effort to achieve complete "objectivity," the scientist had recourse to mathematics and instruments. More recently, the impossibility of escape from the individual and cultural orientation has been widely recognized.7 In an excellent paper on concepts in science, Herbert Blumer writes: Most of the improper usage of the concept in science comes when the concept is set apart from the world of experience, when it is divorced from perception from which it has arisen and into which it ordinarily ties. Detached from experience I This refers to the position of the "relativists." As an extreme example: "The abandonment of the naive realism of the classical period of science entails the abandonment of the absolute; and when I say the abandonment of the abso- lute, I mean not only space, time, and matter, but absolute certainty and-I may as well say it-absolute truth, too. What remains is but a universe of discourse, a playground for the human mind." Aspects of Science by Tobias Dantzig, N. Y., 1937.</page><page sequence="10">DEFINITIONS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE 491 which brought it into existence, it is almost certain to become indefinite and metaphysical.8 This "improper usage" of the concept is precisely comparable to a mechanical imitation of the form in art. When the writer, painter, sculptor, musician imitates a form and brings to it no new percep- tion, brings to it no element of individual experience, his perform- ance is, as I have phrased it, mechanical, or "indefinite and meta- physical." Either form or concept is meaningless when it lacks the element of the individual response to the object or event, "when it is not inside." Forms and concepts alike end by becoming merely formulas which, however widely utilized, are socially harmful when they stifle the development of new meanings and values without which a society stagnates. The form and the concept are then similarly abstractions. They are constructs, having meaning only in relation to their structural content; and while originated by individuals, they express the interrelationships established between the individual and his group and their social and physical environment. The expressions of these interrelationships as stated either in forms or concepts have this "paramount importance . . . (1) this content may become the object of separate investigation and reflection, (2) it may enter into the experience of others and so become common property." 9 GEORGE HAINES, IV CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 8 "Science Without Concepts," by Herbert Blumer, American Journal of Sociology, vol. xxxvi, (1931), p. 530. 9l Ibid., p. 520.</page></plain_text>
