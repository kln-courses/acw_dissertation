However, they have also been attracted by the promises of greater intellectual coherence, sophistication, or ultimate truths that other traditions seemed to offer to a remarkable and underappreciated extent. Al-Ghazâlï, an iconic defender of the intellectualist branch of Sunni tradition (Ash'arism) against challenges posed by rationalist theologians (Mu'tazilites), Aristotelian philosophers, and Neopla tonist Batinites, attempted to synthesize these various traditions, and in the process, struggled with the cultural memory of the salaf. His attempts at resolution ranged from the projection of a selective and romanticized view of the salaf as proto-mystics, neglect and implicit deprecation of the salaf m his mysticial writings, and finally a qualified return to the salaf s way in his last treatise. Although he never seems to settle on a stable alternative to the Sunni teleology in which the salaf always came out on top, he consistently resorts to esotericism and elitism whenever attempting to tran scend the salaf Such tensions and attempts at resolution continue to characterize sub sequent intellectualist Sunni tradition.

Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 tradition, the designation salaf lit., predecessors or forefathers, is applied to the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad and the follow ing two or three generations, referred to here as the "early salaf? and secondarily, as an honorary extension, to those greats in the following few generations who have been canonized as having perfectly preserved and embodied the example of these early Muslims, designated here as the "later salaf " (see EI2 1960-2006, s.v. "À-Salaf wa'l-Khalaf" by E. Chaumont). While this essay focuses on the memory of the salaf m one major strand of the Sunni tradition, the Shi'ite tradition is no less defined by the memory of its pious predecessors, the imams. Rainer Brunner's excellent article has already begun to explore the mechanisms of cultural memory among the Shi'ite Akhbärls (Brunner 2005). In this essay, I focus on the Sunni tradition, but not its ahi al-hadïth or the Hanbalite branch, who saw themselves as the chief defenders of the tradition of the salaf and are obvious candidates for such inquiry. Rather, I pay attention to the Sunni scholastics, the scholars of kaläm (literally "discourse;" often translated as "rational theology" but better understood in its historical context as a particular type of discourse in Islam whose legitimacy has been deeply contested and whose purpose has remained primarily apologetic; see EI2 1960-2006, s.v. "'Ilm al-Kaläm" by L. Gardet) and in particular the Ash'arites, who saw as their raison d'être the intellectual defense of Sunni Islam. Some have suggested a distinction between, on the one hand, the salafiyya, a ten dency in Islam, modern and ancient, which actively endeavors to recre ate the ideal past, and, on the other, "genuine traditionalism," based on "a confident reliance on the past" which deals with inevitable changes by "neutraliz[ing] the evolutionary effects." While a distinction between the two tendencies is plausible, this characterization of either tendency is difficult to accept. The present essay examines the second, synthesiz ing and neutralizing tendency, the so-called "genuine traditionalism," and suggests a different picture. Torn between intellectual pull from various foreign systems of thought and explicitly committed to defend ing the tradition of the salaf this tendency offers us a privileged oppor tunity to investigate the issue of the cultural memory of the early golden age in Islam in particular, and the mechanisms and challenges of maintaining cultural memory more generally. In particular, in this essay I investigate the role of elitism and hierarchy in the structure of</page><page sequence="3">Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 participation in cultural memory, which Jan Assmann has pointed out is concerned with preservation, and suggest how this mechanism may serve not only to preserve but also to transform and manipulate cultural memory (Assmann 2008:114—115). In a tradition like Islam, defined by moments of divine intervention in human history in a sacred past, that past remains in some ways unsurpassable by definition. The preservation, interpretation, and con struction of cultural memory constitute central tasks for the religious elite, which is made even more significant in Islam due to the self conscious emphasis on the historicity and preservation of Islam's scrip ture, the Quran. And yet, Islam's worldly success in spawning a durable civilization led to a paradox: the increasing intellectual sophistication which resulted partly from internal evolution and partly in response to contacts with, incorporation of, and challenges from new systems of thought rendered the maintenance of the cultural memory of the sacred past a rich and complex enterprise. An investigation of how the intel lectual defenders of orthodoxy deal with the memory of the early, pris tine figures — the salaf — allows us to understand how the prospects of progress, development, and the surpassing of the past have been negotiated. This is a particularly fascinating problem in contemporary Islamic cultures, where the tug of war between the memory of the salaf, on the one hand, and modernity, which has made progress a universal desideratum, on the other, is far from over. In order to understand the problems involved in maintaining the cultural memory of the salaf I examine the writings of Abu Hamid al-Ghazäli (d. 1111 ; henceforth Ghazalï) — known as Hujjat al-Isläm (the "Proof of Islam") — seen by many as the most influential scholar of pre-modern Islam, whose complex attitude towards the salaf us exem plified in his ambivalent defense of kaläm is most fruitful to examine not only because of his formative influence on the subsequent Islamic tradition but also because he most poignantly exemplified the synthetic spirit that made for an increasingly complex relationship with that memory. Despite the abundant attention that Ghazâlï has received in tradi tional as well as modern scholarship, scholars are deeply divided about him, the credit for which at least partly goes to himself. The reasons are threefold: his puzzlingly multiple commitments and engagements —</page><page sequence="4">Anjum ! Numen 58 (2011) 344-374 whether they can be synthesized into a coherent system remains a con tested question; his esotericism and elitism, which apparently allowed him to teach different things to different audiences, and which are often hard to reconcile; and finally, the intellectual crises and development evident in his vast oeuvre, the understanding of which is only compli cated by his own "autobiography."1 Furthermore, a theologian's attitude towards the salaf was a major defining issue in Islam that decided his or her orthodoxy, and any Sunni theologians aspiring to transcend (what they took to be) the salaf s way in religion had to justify such transgres sion to their contemporaries and to themselves. Investigating such atti tudes cannot be a matter of simple piecemeal reading but requires understanding the general system of thought, cutting through camou flage, and reconstructing implications. Any satisfactory interpretation of Ghazâlî's attitude towards the salaf will, therefore, have to adopt a general framework for the interpretation of all of Ghazâlî's thought. In order to examine further Ghazâlï's dilemma, its trajectory, as well as the over-all nature of the problem of maintaining or manipulating the cultural memory of the salaf in the Sunni tradition, I illuminate Ghazâlï's attitude towards the salaf hy comparing it with that of Shäh Wall Allah (d. ca. 1762), another great Sunni theologian, mystic, and jurist of great repute. I treat him rather briefly, but his relatively bold and stable attitude towards the memory of the ^/^/"nonetheless serves as an instructive contrast with that of Ghazäli. In the following, I will give a brief history of kaldm and its position vis-à-vis the salaf, thus contextualizing Ghazâlï's project, then offer an interpretation of it, situating it in modern scholarship on the subject, and finally offer a comparison with Wall Alläh's approach. Ghazäli, Kalam, and the Salaf Like the other two Abrahamic traditions, Judaism and Christianity, the major intellectual drama in Islamic civilization was fuelled by the encounter between Jerusalem/Mecca and Athens — between those who Griffel 2009 is the most recent comprehensive attempt to present a coherent view of Ghazäll's cosmology; see Griffel 2009:20ff. for the problematic nature of Ghazâlïs "autobiography" in his Munqidh.</page><page sequence="5">348 O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 believed in the truth of the revelation of a personal, omnipotent, and omniscient God and those who subscribed to Greek philosophy or its legacy traditions, in which God, if there was one, served as merely the First Cause of the otherwise intellectually determinable universe. The problem of the origins of systematic rational speculation on God and human beings and their respective agencies, captured in the dialectic discourse which acquired the label kaläm in early Islam, has vexed many. From an historical perspective, whether kaläm was exogenous or endogenous to Islam appears to be an irresolvable problem, for which the answers proposed depend more on the definitions and philosophi cal presumptions of an inquiry than on historical evidence (Hourani 1976; Watt 1973:182ff.). For the present inquiry, it is sufficient to note that the place or authority of kaläm discourse is one of the key issues in defining the cultural memory of early Islam. Generally speaking, of the four major religious discourses in Islamic civilization, hadith (lit., report), fiqh (jurisprudence; lit., understanding), kaläm, and Sufism (tasawwuf ), the tension with the cultural memory of the salafhus been most explicitly encountered in the last two. At first, kaläm was strictly rejected by the hadith and fiqh scholars; in fact, this loosely connected "proto-Sunni" group of scholars may be better defined by its rejection of kaläm in favor of continuity with the way of the Prophet and the early community than by any distinctive set of shared doctrines (EF 1960-2006, s.v. "'Ilm al-kaläm" by L. Gardet). By the tenth century, the methodological apparatus of kaläm had been adopted and adapted by Sunni theologians in defense of Sunni Islam against rationalist theologians, the Mutazilites, and the Shi'ites (van Ess 1965—1966:138). The most important factor of all for the formation and development of Sunni kaläm was the intellectual chal lenge of the rationalist theology advocated by the Mu'tazila, which pro vided both the main target as well as the intellectual toolset for Sunni kaläm. The "inquisition" (mihna) of Ibn Hanbal backed by the ratio nalists and the eventual triumph of the unassuming traditionalist had caused their fall from grace, but their intellectual demise did not automatically follow; it was accomplished by the Ash'arites. That in the process both the early Islamic doctrines and the kaläm methods were inevitably transformed is hardly disputable, although the nature of this transformation, the extent of the accord of Ash arite theology with the</page><page sequence="6">O. Anjum /Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 349 understanding of the salaf, and the rigor and integrity of its dialectic methods, have remained fiercely debated. The hadlth group, which at the time stood at the core of the emerging Sunni orthodoxy and became identified starting in the fourth/tenth century primarily as the Hanbalite school, rejected not only the enemy but also his methods, including al-Ash'ari's intellectual defense (Makdisi 1981; Melchert 1997). Ash'arism was therefore born as multiply apologetic: it needed to justify its orthodoxy vis-à-vis scripture to the conservative Sunni core (hadlth group), its rationality against the Mu'tazilites, and its political narrative against the Shi'ites. The Sunni tradition, which in its forma tive phase had been anti-kaläm, was now divided into kaläm and anti kaläm camps. The bone of contention between the hadïth party and the Mu'tazilites had been the interpretation of divine attributes in the Qur an, which also had implications for the issues of predestination and causality. The Ash'arites saw themselves as standing between, on the one hand, the rationalists, who denied divine attributes (a position its proponents described as tanzïb, "upholding God's transcendence," and detractors as nafi or tatti, "denial of divine attributes") and, on the other hand, the hadïth group, now chiefly the Hanbalites, who affirmed them (hence called themselves ahi al-ithbät, affirmers of God's attributes "without asking how" [bilä kayf ], but denigrated by their detractors as Hashwiyya or Mujassima, anthropomorphists; see EI2 1960—2006, s.v. "Tashbïh wa-Tanzïh" by J. van Ess). The Ash'arites increasingly leaned towards their rationalist interlocu tors, as evident progressively in the writings of al-Hasan al-Tabari (d. ca. 990), Abü Bakr al-Baqillani (d. 1013), and al-Baghdädi (d. 1037). Starting in the eleventh century, with the emergence of loyal Ash'arites like al-Bayhaql (d. 1066) in the domains of hadlth and Shâfi'î jurispru dence and al-Qushayrï (d. 1074) in Sufism, Ash'ar is m began to stabilize and expand as a school (Mahmüd 1994:586; Subhl 1982:93). A nota ble contribution of Sufi writers like al-Qushayrl to Ash'arism was increased inclination towards elitism and esotericism in the spiritual and social domains (Anjum 2009; Karamustafa 2007:116-119). Around the same time, the emergence of Neoplatonist Aristotelian phi losophy as a rival on the religious scene, especially with Avicenna (d. 1037), posed a formidable threat not only to Sunni doctrines but</page><page sequence="7">350 O. Anjum /Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 also to the very idea of a personal God, and increasingly replaced Mu'tazilism as the chief threat and interlocutor. It was not until Ghazäll, however, that the full impact of these mystical and philosophical doc trines was felt in kaläm. Ghazâlï's teacher, Abü'l-Ma'äli al-Juwaynï (d. 1085), was one of the major turning points in the history of Ash'arism, daringly critical of the earlier Ash'arite masters for their inconsistency and thoroughly aware of and influenced by the Mu'tazilite tradition. Perhaps since the Mu tazilites no longer posed a threat (outside of Shi'ism, that is), Juwayni did not shy away from drawing nearer to their position in key theoretical issues (Juwaynï 1981:1.277; Mahmud 1994:612ff.). Thus, even though nominal rivalry on token issues continued, the Ash arites had come full circle with respect to the Mu'tazilite doctrines, based on whose methods and vocabulary and against whose positions they had begun as a school. Among the Ash'arites, the idea of having transcended the salaf in knowledge, sophistication, and clarity is clearest in Juwaynï. In al-Käfiya fi Ί-jadal, he wrote: [The salafì realized that there will be after them those whom God will choose for excellence in endeavor, greater understanding, perspicacity and intelligence ... they therefore did not engage in depth (with contentious issues) and remained brief and satisfied with allusions. (Juwaynï 1979:346—347) Late in life, however, Juwaynï's opinion regarding the intellectual capac ity and perspicacity of the early Muslims (salaf ) seems to have changed. In Ghiyäth al-umam, he makes an impassioned plea to follow the early Muslims who were superior is every respect. [The salaf ] forbade indulging in ambiguities and hair-splitting of confusing issues... sophistry in responses to questions, focusing rather on encouraging peo ple towards piety, benevolence, not harming others, and being obedient to God according to one's capacity.... They were the most intelligent of people and best in speech. (Juwaynl 1981:190-191) In al-Nizämiyya, the last of his works, Juwayni professes to have reverted to the "way of the salaf " which he describes as tafwld (quoted in Mahmüd 1994:618). Furthermore, his traditional biographers consis</page><page sequence="8">O. Anjum /Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 351 tently inform us that towards the end of his life, he would regret his engagement with philosophy and kaläm and desire for the "faith of the old women of Nishapur:" "Be my witness that I have retracted every opinion that opposes the Sunna, and I die upon the creed of the old women of Nishapur!" (Dhahabï 1992:XVIII, 463—474; Mahmüd 1994:632; Subkl 1905:V, 191). These reports give a sense of nostalgic longing for the pristine and unintellectual faith of the salaf after having been enticed by kaläm, a sense which is generally consistent with Juwaynï's well-attested writings. Apparently not heeding his master's warnings, Ghazâlî delved deeply into not only kaläm but philosophy, systematically advancing the use of syllogism and philosophical concepts in his defense of the Ash'arite doctrines that his master had inaugurated. The philosophers and the Batinites become not only his main interlocutors and rivals but were also, given his synthetic impulse, incorporated in complex ways into his own thought. In his magnum opus, Ihya 'ulüm al-din (Revival of the Sciences of Religion), Ghazäll could report from a certain distance that kaläm was strictly prohibited and condemned by "the imams of the salaf " like Malik (d. 795), Abü Yüsuf (d. 798), al-Shâfi'ï (d. 820), and Ahmad b. Hanbal and "all of the hadïth scholars." It would seem from the open ing of his al-Risälat al-qudsiyya, incorporated as one of the earliest books of the Ihya, that he shared the salafs view on the issue. Regarding how to instill proper faith in the heart of believers since young age, he writes, One should do ones utmost to protect oneself from hearing anything of disputa tion ( jadal ) and kaläm... Compare the belief i^aqida) of the people of piety and righteousness among the commoners with the belief of a kaläm scholar or one who engages in (scholarly) disputations, and you will find that the belief of the commoner in its stability is like a lofty mountain which is not shaken by any earthquake or thunder, while the belief of the mutakallim who guards his belief with the categories of disputations is like a thread hanging loose in the wind which the breeze bends now in one direction now in another. The only exception [to this weakening of faith] is someone who hears from a mutakallim a proof of an article of faith and then holds fast to that proof without argument (taqlld just as he holds fast to that article of faith without argument. (Ghazâlï 2004: I, 127)</page><page sequence="9">352 O. Anjum /Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 However, after this clear statement on the harms of kaläm, Ghazâlï addresses whether "the learning of jadal (disputation) and kaläm is blameworthy." Having listed several statements by major figures among the (later) W¿z/"condemning kaläm, he deems these too simplistic and sweeping and contends that kaläm is only a tool which could be put to good or evil uses; it is nothing but a natural response to the increasingly demanding intellectual opposition to the truth in changing times, nothing but the employment of legitimate reason to the articles of faith. Had the Companions (i.e., the early salaf) needed it, they would have employed it. Ghazâlï moves on to wrap up this discourse by giving a list of pros and cons of kaläm. He writes: [In the use of kaläm] there is benefit and there is harm, and it is prohibited when or where it is harmful. Its harm is that it raises doubts and shakes beliefs, dislodg ing them from certitude and firmness. That is what occurs in the beginning, and the restitution of [the earlier state of certitude] is ever doubtful, and it is different for different people. This is the harm of kaläm for the people of the True Creed [namely, the Sunnis]. It has another harm for the heretical innovators, which is to reassure them in their innovative heresies and install them firmly in their hearts, for kaläm incites them and sharpens their appetite to insist on these heresies. (Ghazäli 2004:1, 127) In addition to the inciting of doubts, kaldms reliance on disputation, apologetics, and polemics rather than on fundamental rational princi ples appears to be one major disqualifying weakness in Ghazâlï's view. As for its benefit: It might be supposed [by some] that its benefit is the unveiling of the ultimate truths and the knowledge of their exact nature. Alas, kaläm does not deliver this noble promise. It may be that confusion and misguidance in it are greater than any unveiling or attainment of knowledge. If you heard this from a hadlth scholar (;muhadAith) or a Hashwi, you might think that people are simply enemies of what they do not know. But hear this from someone who has known kaläm by experience and detested it after having known its reality and after having been completely submerged into it, and gone beyond it to delve into other sciences of its kind, and has finally reached the conclusion that the path to the realities of knowledge are shut from this direction. By my life, kaläm is not below unveiling, defining or explaining a matter or two, but rarely does it help in case of clear mat ters that are almost better understood before delving into the arguments of kalam\ (Ghazâli 2004:1, 131)</page><page sequence="10">O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 Ghazâlï's rejection of kalâms efficacy in procuring faith, he wishes to show, is in spite of all his sympathy as an insider. He is at pains here to distance himself from the simple-minded hadïth group, the Hanbalites, and other groups lumped under the derogatory label Hashwiyya. This would lead us to expect a prohibition of kaläm by Ghazâlî after the way of the salaf. But that is not what we read next: But its benefit is only one: the guarding of the creed that we have previously elaborated for the common people, and protecting it against the heretics' skepti cism by various types of disputations. For the commoner is shaken by the disputa tion of a heretic even if it is invalid; while confronting the invalid with the invalid repels it. (Ghazali 2004:1, 131) How may we understand this rather puzzling defense-cum-condemna tion of kaläm? The common righteous believer untouched by kalâm is seen as both an immovable mount of faith yet also fickle in front of heretical disputation all at the same time; the theologian is both a sol dier of faith, necessary to defend the faith of the common majority, but also fickle and weak in faith, all in the same chapter of Ihya . While this contradiction may be irresolvable, the following analogy may approxi mate Ghazäll's attitude: kaläm is seen here as antidote, albeit a deficient one, to the poison of skepticism, which may be harmful in itself but useful and indeed necessary only when the poison has been swallowed. Its benefit is extremely limited: to defend the unfortunate souls who have fallen into doubting and asking questions, knowing that even this antidote will never fully cure them. The right attitude of a commoner is to believe and trust, rather than understand and reproduce, the intel lectual defense and explanation of the right creed provided by these (afflicted) kaläm scholars. The interesting question for our inquiry is why Ghazäll does not simply return to the salaf's position, as his teacher Juwaynl had done, after having seen the harms of kaldrrii Why adhere to an ineffective defense, even against the recommendations of the salafi Ghazalï's corpus, and his turn to Aristotelian syllogism and Neoplatonist mysti cism, I argue below, can be seen as fundamentally concerned with this problem.</page><page sequence="11">Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 From Rational Theology (kalam) to Divine Disclosure (:mukäshafa) After his aforementioned ambivalent defense of kaläm, Ghazalï goes on a few pages later in Ihya to reiterate the standard Asharite positions, arguing forcefully that the later salaf, in particular Ahmad b. Hanbal, were overly and naively cautious and had therefore stopped at the exo teric meanings and "closed the door" of interpretation out of fear of transgression. The Mutazilites, however, transgressed in divine attri butes, and the philosophers went beyond all limits by denying all scrip tural data. The Ash'arite kaläm, he implies, has got it right. However, the way to prove their position is not rational, but esoteric: And the line of moderation (iqtisäd) between this libertarianism (inhiläl) fof the Mu'tazilites and the philosophers] and the rigidity of the Hanbalites ( jumüd al-hanäbila) is thin and obscure, no one attains it except by God's grace, those who know these matters by divine light, not by tradition (bi nur ilähi lä bi Ί-sama). Then, after the secrets of these matters have been unveiled to them, they look at the words of the scripture, and whatever agrees with what they have observed with the light of certainty, they approve, and whatever disagrees with it, they interpret metaphorically (fa mä wäqafa mä shähadühu bi nür al-yaqin, qarrarühu wa mä khälafa awwalühu). (Ghazäli 2004:1, 139) This passage suggests that Ghazäll continued to defend what he believed to be the crux of the Ash'arite doctrine, and separated it from the defi ciencies of kaläm as a method. Furthermore, his turn towards mysti cism was connected to his intellectual project; it was the failure of kaläm to deliver definitive proofs and the bliss of certitude that necessitated Sufism, rather than merely a union of two useful sciences of Islam. Furthermore, the teachings of scripture were to be submitted to the judgment of the inner light and accepted or interpreted away in accor dance with that judgment. Subjective experience of truth thus stood above both reason and revelation. Sufism for Ghazäll was the way to prepare the soul for the divine disclosure which brought it into direct contact with the unseen realities that exoteric rational discourse seemed unable to prove. In his post-Äjw writings, he consistently privileges divine light (nur ilähi) and mukäshafa (literally, "the process of disclo sure or unveiling;" "theophany" would be the more idiomatic option; it will be left untranslated here due to its centrality for Ghazäll) as a</page><page sequence="12">O. Anjum /Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 355 third path in contradistinction to both reason and revelation. The nature of this "divine disclosure," however, is far from simple. Few scholars now unproblematically accept Ghazäll's self-presenta tion in al-Mundiqh min al-daläl ("The Rescuer from Error") as an impartial seeker of truth who fairly examined kaläm, Batinite teach ings, and philosophy, all in vain, until he found direct experiential knowledge based on divine disclosure, mukäshafa, in Sufism, which was the ultimate response to all his intellectual doubts. Taking seriously Ghazäll's philosophical works, Richard Frank (1994:98-99) called into question Ghazäll's Ash'arism as well as his Sufism, underscored his debt to Avicenna and Neoplatonism, and contended that he was deliberately misleading in his profession of Ash'arism and superficial and patchy in his philosophy. While Richard Frank's overstatement of his case for the inauthenticity of Ghazäll's Ash'arism and Sufism has been criticized (Dallai 2002), Frank Griffels recent work on Ghazäll's cosmology makes an impressive case that Ghazâlï had worked out a coherent phil osophical system which did not require abandoning (what Ghazâlï con sidered to be) the fundamental tenets of Ash'arite kaläm (Griffel 2004 and especially 2009). Another scholar goes on to argue that Ghazäll's Ilm al-mukâshafa, the way which he constantly put up as the ultimate truth suited for the elite of the elite, was neither purely Avicennan phi losophy, as Richard Frank would have it, nor Sufism, as his traditional interpreters have understood, but an organic whole which harmonized the two (Treiger 2008). While these recent studies have persuasively argued that Ghazäll's Avicennan and Neoplatonist commitments can not be dismissed as forged or merely linguistic borrowing, I find unper suasive Griffels argument that there is no difference or contradiction between Ghazäll's esoteric and exoteric teachings. While the scope does not allow a full treatment of his learned argument, which will engage the field for some time to come, I underscore the element of develop ment and change, even reversal, in Ghazäll's position vis-à-vis the high est knowledge and the salaf,7 I examine these issues in three widely 21 Griffel 2009:286, arguing for a coherent picture of Ghazâlï's cosmology, writes: "Often, assigning esotericism to an author or referring to inconsistencies in a textual corpus is a hermeneutic device to mask the failure of interpreters to understand the texts." It may be so, but imposing forced coherence on thinkers of the past is no less common a problem among interpreters. The increasing consensus of scholars that</page><page sequence="13">356 O.

This science, Treiger notes, includes "the science of divine disclosure" (ilm al-mukäshafa) as well as the science of spiritual practice ('ilm al-muämala), and the latter prepares the soul for the former, the ultimate goal of which is the imme diate knowledge, or gnosis, of God {ma rifat Allah)" (Treiger 2008:47; 337). Treiger further argues that in Ghazâlï's Ihya the concept of mukäshafa, already familiar in the Sufi literature, acquires "distinctive noetics" with its "image of the heart as a polished mirror" that have no precedence in the classical Sufi literature (Treiger 2008:54-55). One persistent theme in all of Ghazâlï's spiritual literature (i.e., all of his writings including and after Ihya, possibly including earlier Sufi works like Mïzân al-amai) is his thorough-going esotericism and elitism (see Treiger 2008:55ff.). Both the noetic (that is, imparting knowledge, not mere faith or feeling) and esoteric elements of mukäshafa are evident in the following passage in Ihya : [The science of disclosure, 'ilm al-mukäshafa] is the light that appears in the heart when it is purified and purged of its blameworthy attributes, and by virtue of that knowledge many matters of which one used to hear only the names and know only the general meaning open up to him until he acquires the knowledge of the reality of the being of God Almighty, his lasting and perfect attributes, his acts and wisdom in the creation of this world and the hereafter, and the way he has preferred the hereafter over this world, and the knowledge of the meaning of prophecy and prophethood, the meaning of revelation, of devil, of the terms such as angels and devils, the nature of devil s animosity towards men, the nature of the appearance of angels to the prophets, and the nature of the reception of revelation by the Prophets, and the knowledge of the dominion of the heavens and the earth.. .This knowledge is not written in books nor those whom God has granted some of it may speak to anyone of it except with others like them by way of reminder and with secrecy — such is the esoteric knowledge {'ilm al-bätin). (Ghazäli 2004:1, 20-21) Given the nature of Ihya as a text written primarily for the commoners and the exoteric 'ulama, the elaboration of mukdshafa here is perhaps deliberately vague, but is elaborated in Ghazâlïs more elite-oriented writings like Mishkdt.</page><page sequence="15">358 O. Anjum /Numen 58 (2011) 344-374 Esotericism and Elitism Esotericism and elitism are not accidental to Ghazâlî's thought; they are necessitated by the nature of his intellectual project. In the move from reason to mukäshafa as the defense or proof of the right doctrines, a new dilemma emerges for Ghazâlï. Once the subjectivity of the ulti mate source of knowledge and certitude is acknowledged, how could the truth be separated from false doctrines, heresies combated, ortho doxy upheld, and the chaos of subjectivity averted? As a Sunni theolo gian, Ghazâlï was eminently interested in that endeavor, and hence, despite his disparagement of kaldm, he never abjured it. The age-old solution to the problem of esoteric chaos has been hierarchy, election, and elitism. In this respect Ghazâlï adopted, without giving due credit, the Batinite solution, from whom he seemed to have learned not only elitism but also Neoplatonist doctrines. In his Mlzän al-amai, written most likely after his main tract against the Batinites, al-Mustazhiri (see Hourani 1984:294-295; Mitha 2001:100-101), the spiritual stratifi cation and difference between private and public knowledge that is the hall-mark of the Batinite doctrine and later mystical Sufis are explicitly defended: You might say: your discourse in this book is divided into what is in accordance with the Sufi school and what is in accordance with the Ash'arite school and some of the kaldm scholars — but a discourse is to be understood according to but one school. Which of these schools is the right one? How could it be understood that all of these are true (despite their contradictions)? And if a part of each is true, what is it? (Ghazâlï 1964:405) To this quandary of his seemingly multiple commitments that his stu dents and contemporaries must have faced, Ghazâlï's response is that every master (kdmil) has three schools (madhhabs): first, that which one learns from one's parents, teachers, and surroundings and for which one develops a prejudice; second, "what one adopts in one's teachings and instruction of those who come to him seeking knowledge and guidance, and this is not one thing but depends on the level of the seeker or the student — and he sees what every student is capable of understanding"; third, "what a man believes privately between himself and God Almighty and no one else but God knows about it; and he</page><page sequence="16">O. Anjum /Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 359 does not mention it except to those who share the knowledge that one has, or has reached such a level that that knowledge could be received and understood by him" (Ghazâlï 1964:405—409) .3 The reason for this strict secrecy is evidently the incapacity of the commoners to grasp the true beliefs of the philosopher-mystic. As noted earlier, Ghazall does 31 Griffel 2009:359, η. 45, states that in this oft-quoted passage of Ghazâlï, on which many scholars have relied in order to understand Ghazâlï's apparent self-contradic tions, Ghazâlï "actually rejects the described attitude." Griffel goes on to summarize Ghazâlï's position: " [Ghazâlï] refers to a group of scholars who express one set of teach ings in public disputations, another group who express their teachings while instruct ing their students, and a third group who keep it secret between themselves and God. Al-Ghazâlï contrasts this attitude with the position to thoroughly investigate the sub ject in question, to develop one position, and to teach that in all circumstances to all people. The latter is the attitude to be favored" (emphasis in the original). This, how ever, is a mistaken reading of Ghazâlï's words on more than one account. Firstly, Ghazâlï speaks not of three groups but of two, the first being those who hold three madhhabs, and the second being those who insist on having only one madhhab. Sec ondly, the multiple madhhab option is Ghazâlï's response to the questioner's puzzle ment about Ghazâlï's seemingly multiple commitments; for Ghazâlï to reject this option would render the whole discussion meaningless. Thirdly, Ghazâlï does not favor the second position but rather says, after describing the first in four pages and the second in less than half a page, "The first group agrees with the second in that if they are asked about their madhhab, whether it is one or three, it is not permissible for them to say 'three'. Rather, it is obligatory to say, 'it is one'. This renders useless your tiring yourself with the question of madhhab. If you are intelligent, [you will see that] people agree on professing that the madhhab is one ( fa-inna al-näs muttafiqün 'ala al-nutq bi anna al-madhhab wähid)" (Ghazâlï 1964:409). Then Ghazâlï continues to instruct the questioner, in a clearly pedagogical tone, on a related but different issue: "[People] also are united in their prejudice for the madhhab of their father, teacher, or city; but what is your benefit in it, when there are so many of them around and no one has a definitive advantage? So give up worrying about madhhabs and seek truth through your own thinking, so that you have a madhhab [of your own] (fa-jänib al-iltifät ila al-madhähib wa-tlub al-haqq bi-tariq al-nazar litakùn sähib madhhab)." It is evident that Ghazâlï merely wishes to deflect his students' attention to the issue of following (,taqlid ) others' madhhabs, and it is here that he instructs that the student of knowl edge should develop a position of his own rather than worrying about the many con tradictory opinions of others. This suggests that the reading of many more scholars, traditional and modern, that Ghazâlï indeed not only favored but espoused the three madhhab opinion is correct. Elitism and esotericism are writ large on practically all of his spiritual and intellectual writings.</page><page sequence="17">360 O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 not shy away in his Ihya from using the word bätin — the linchpin the Batinites — to characterize this highest form of knowing. The Image of the Salaf in Ihya Ihya has a curious relationship with the salaf in more ways than one. More than any other spiritual work of Ghazâlî, Ihya is adorned with references from the Qur an and the hadith (the majority of the hadith being those deemed unsound by the traditional hadith scholars, but the Sufi-leaning romanticization of early history in these reports nonetheless serves Ghazäll's purpose well), thus suggesting that Ihyä"s purpose is to address the commoners, which included the exoteric scholars, and not primarily the elite. Explaining how the way of the early community has been lost, for the restoration of which Ihya is composed, he writes, During the Caliphate after the Prophet, the Rightly Guided Caliphs were the leaders of scholars of God (' ulama bi'lläh), who understood God's commands and ways, were capable of issuing independent judgments, and did not seek help from tht fiiqaha except rarely and only when consultation was necessary, hence the scholars {'ulama) had time to devote themselves exclusively to the sciences of the hereafter, and would avoid giving legal verdicts, turning their efforts to God, as known from the accounts of their lives. (Ghazâll 2004:1, 61) In this curious view of history, the early community is seen as properly stratified and classified after the pattern of the eleventh-century Islamic world, with distinct classes of rulers, scholars, and commoners, the true scholars being devoted to the inward sciences, leaving law and policy to the rulers and administrators. After the golden age of the "Four Rightly Guided" caliphs immediately after Muhammad, the incapable caliphs desperately needed the fuqaba to engage in worldly matters of jurispru dence and law, but the pious among them continued to avoid this worldly matters (Ghazäll 2004:1, 61—62). In this process, the key terms that used to be concerned with the hereafter alone in the time of the pious predecessors (al-salaf al-sälih) became replaced by or overloaded with incorrect meanings. In particu lar, the meanings of key words such as fiqh, 'ilm, and tawhïd became narrowed or corrupted. Tawhïd, God's Oneness, which had now come</page><page sequence="18">Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 to mean disputations of kaldm, raising of questions and doubts and silencing of opponents, used to mean "the seeing of everything as being from God in such a way that severed reliance on causes and intermedi ate means, such that they saw all good and evil being from none but Him the Exalted" (Ghazâlî 2004:1, 50). Some neologisms such as shatahât ("ecstatic outbursts") of the Sufis and tämmät (lit., "perfections") of the Batinites are also chastised as meaningless or misleading. In his criticism of ecstatic outbursts {shatahât) he writes that these are "boastful claims about [a] passionate love affair with God (al-ishq ma a Allah) and wisdl (attainment) which render outwardly worship superfluous, to the point that some people have gone on to claim union (ittihäd ), the lifting of veils, direct visual contemplation (mushähada bi'l-ru'ya) and conversation (with God)" (Ghazäll 2004:1, 54). Ghazäll has little patience for this: None can stop these idiots from such claims or from saying ridiculous and con fused things, for if you try to, they retort, "Your attempt to prevent us is because of knowledge ('ilm) and disputation (jidäl), and knowledge is a veil (from higher realities) and disputation is an act of the (appetitive) self. These words of ours cannot be seen except from within by the unveiling of the light of the Truth (bi mukäshafat nur al-haqq)." The evil of things like this has permeated through the lands, as has their harm for the commoners, to the extent that it would be better to execute anyone who says things of this kind than to save ten lives! (Ghazäli 2004:1, 50) Interestingly, the arguments of the pretentious commoners whom Ghazâlï dismisses and deems worthy of execution are very similar to his own arguments about the justification of similar claims. Furthermore, it would seem here that Ghazâlï disapproves of ecstatic outbursts alto gether, when in fact it is only the rowdy commoners (lazy peasants abandoning their fields and pretending to be love-struck mystics and beggars) whose antinomianism and social harm he is concerned about. He points out the conceited or fraudulent commoners, who pretend to be like al-Halläj or al-Bistâmï, who are known for such outbursts. But, surprisingly, he denies at this point in Ihya that al-Bistâmï ever engaged in these: "As for Abu Yazïd al-Bistämi, God have mercy on him, such reports are false; and if it was heard from him, he was perhaps merely reporting from God" (Ghazâlï 2004:1, 54-55). In hisMishkät, however,</page><page sequence="19">Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 written shortly after Ihya', he attributes such ecstatic outbursts rever ently to the highest saints, the gnostics ('ärifün), at the end of attain ment, just next to the prophets, who realize there is nothing in existence but God. Here he specifically mentions the outbursts ascribed to al-Halläj ("I am Truth") and to al-Bistäml ("Glory to Me"). Clearly, he does not doubt the authenticity of attribution to al-Bistäml here (Ghazäli 1998:17—18, 51). This discrepancy can be attributed neither to diachronic development nor to pedagogical concerns, both of which are palpable factors in Ghazäll's corpus generally, but rather to thor oughgoing elitism, in which qualitatively different knowledge is con sidered suited for different kinds of recipients. To sum up, although infused with Sufi themes and traditions, Ihya prefers to emphasize 'Um al-äkhira ("the science of the hereafter") rather than explicit Sufism, perhaps because it would have been much easier to connect to the salaf and to preach to the generality of Muslims. It may also be that for Ghazäll the advocacy of the relatively new move ment of Sufism was not as critical as the deployment of Sufi themes in his own way in the intellectual struggles and disputes of the time, such as in kaläm, the defense of Sunnism, and the revival of legal sciences. Regardless, Ihya is not a return to the salaf, or akin to the Hanbalite rejection of post-W¿z/"intellectual and spiritual developments, but rather the projection of Sufi spirituality onto the salaf and then the presenta tion of salaf as models for reform. The message of Ihya is also deeply elitist: the return to the way of the salaf does not resolve the intellectual challenges of the time, or even disclose the highest realities, but it is the best the commoners and the exoteric scholars can do. Written for the commoners, the tone and message of Ihya are distinct from those of the Mishkät and other philosophical and esoteric works. To the problem of how the salaf, the best of all men according to the Sunni doctrine, could have been unaware of the rational sciences of kaldm and spiritual mysteries of mukäshafa, Ghazâlï has two answers. As far as kaldm is concerned, they would have embraced it, as a neces sary evil perhaps, as Ghazâlï does, had they encountered its need (Ghazâlï 2004:1, 139). As for mukäshafa, the essence of mysticism, the best of the salaf seem to have already possessed it, hence Ghazàlï's insis tence on a secret (sirr) in Abu Bakr's heart that made him superior to all others (Ghazâlï 2004:1, 127). Esotericism and elitism, the cornerstones of Ghazàlï's thought, are thus projected back onto the salaf</page><page sequence="20">O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344-374 363 Salafanà Ghazalian Neoplatonism Of the various mystical works Ghazäli wrote in the period after Ihya and before his final retreat to his birth-town of Tus, one work, Mishkät al-anwär ("The Niche of Lights"), is particularly important, and I argue that it presents a different picture of mukäshafa as well as the salaf than Ihya } Ghazâlï's description of this divine light in Ihya is perhaps delib erately elusive, but it is elaborated fully in his Mishkät as well as in his other writings that employ explicitly Neoplatonist vocabulary In this treatise, presumably written for the elite in response to a request to divulge some of these divine secrets, he hesitatingly begins to do so, impressing upon the questioner the enormity of the question he has asked, for "not all realities are to be elaborated and exposed, rather the breasts of free men (of God) are graves of secrets — as some gnostics ('ärifün) have said, 'divulging the secrets of Lordship is disbelief'" (Ghazäli 1998:1—2). Later in Mishkät, he goes on to interpret some Qur anic references as well as the purpose of the spiritual endeavor in a clearly Neoplatonist way, in which the visible world is seen as "a ladder to the world of dominion (malaküt)" — this is clearly not metaphor for the scriptural concept of an afterlife, but reference to the gnostic path that Near Eastern mysticism sought in this very world. The emphasis is laid on relatedness (munäsaba) or similitude (mithäl) between the two worlds, which makes possible climbing from one to another. Parallel to the sun, the moon, and the stars in the visible world are angels in the world of dominion, which are explained as "luminous substances" (jawähir nüräniyya) (Ghazäli 1998:27). In Ma'ärij al-quds, too, the attribution of which to Ghazäli has been disputed, the author interprets the "verse of Light" (Q 24:35) in an even more explicitly Neoplatonist way (quoted in Mahmüd 1994:11, 180).5 Such passages prompted Fazlur Rahman to comment that Ghazäli is profoundly incoherent, 41 Griffel 2009:9 points out the centrality of Mishkdt in prompting scholars in the twentieth century to reconsider Ghazali's traditional self-presentation and suggests (2009:264-266) that it was written after Ihya. 51 Mdârij has been considered spurious by scholars (e.g. Hourani 1984 does not men tion it), but Griffels recent study suggests that Mdârij's attribution to Ghazali need not be questioned, because its arguments are in keeping with al-Ghazäli's theory of prophecy in his more authentic works; see Griffel 2009:138. Regardless, my present argument does not rely on Mdârij but on Ghazäll's undisputed works.</page><page sequence="21">Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344-374 because he excommunicates philosophers like Avicenna in some of his writings, "[b]ut then [there] follows the chapter on the characteristics of prophecy', which is almost word to word borrowed from Avicenna" (Griffel 2004:138; Rahman 1979:98). Ghazâlï's critics, in particular Ibn Rushd, not surprisingly berated him for "hypocritically rejecting, or pretending to reject, on certain occasions what the Mishkät and other works of Ghazalï espoused" (Davidson 1992:130). The first part of Mishkät presents a metaphysical discussion on the nature of light, while the second, more concrete for our purpose, pres ents a gradation of the human path to the divine, ostensibly based on an alleged prophetic tradition (mentioned in Ihya in passing, Ghazâlï 2004:1, 135), in which God is said to be veiled by seventy thousand, or seventy, veils of light and darkness. Ghazâlï uses it to present his own classification of the human attitudes towards God into three kinds. Those of the first kind are veiled by pure darkness, such are those who do not believe in God, those of the second are veiled by light that accompanies some darkness, while those of the third are veiled by pure light (Ghazâlï 1998:44ff.). Those of the first kind do not concern them selves with God at all, while those of the second include three subtypes: the first being limited to senses (worshipping God through idols, hand some humans, fire, celestial bodies, gods of light and darkness), the second limited by imagination, and the third by false rational analogies. In the second subtype, those limited by the veil of imagination, are included those who worship a deity who sits (quid) on a throne, some even attributing a body to God (mujassima), while others deny a body but attribute directionality ( jiha) — the latter being a Hanbalite posi tion, although it is not named as such. The third subtype, limited by false analogies, includes those who deny directionality {jiha) to God as well but still analogize God's attributes to their own. What is interest ing is that on this view not only these orthodox Sunni groups but the later salaf and the early Ash'arites would be counted in the second or at best third category, making it barely above the fire-worshippers (Ghazâlï 1998:66, η. 12, 13). The third kind, those "veiled by sheer lights," is further divided into three types, but a fourth type is also added at the end. The first of these are those who know the meanings of the attributes through "verifica tion" (Ghazâlï 1998:50), which most likely means intellectual investi</page><page sequence="22">O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 365 gation, namely kaläm. They come to know that ascribing the attributes of "speaking," "desiring," etc., to God is different from ascribing those to other than God. This position captures the view of the later Ashari tes, starting perhaps with Juwayni. Next, superior to the Ash'arites and nearer to the divine, are those who see God as a mover of the farthest celestial body: It becomes manifest to them that there is multiplicity in the heavens and that the mover of each specific heaven is a different existent thing called an "angel," of whom there are many. The angel's relationship with the divine lights is that of the stars. Furthermore, it appears to these people that these heavens are inside another celestial sphere that moves all of them by its movement once in a day and a night. Hence, the Lord is the mover of the furthest celestial body that envelops all the celestial spheres, since plurality is rejected as pertaining to the Lord. (Ghazâlï 1998:50-51) Passages like this confirm that Ghazâlï employs Neoplatonist concepts, not merely Neoplatonist language for Islamic concepts.6 The third sub type comprises those who hold that the Lord merely commands an angel to set things in motion; these people obviously realize that the Lord is too holy to act directly, the details of that command being too abstruse to be explained even in Mishkät. Finally, the fourth type com prises the only ones "who have arrived" ("wäsilün"), who "have found Him too holy for and incomparable with all that we described earlier" (Ghazäll 1998:50—51). These wäsilün are divided into two groups; the first group sees that everything is annihilated but the observers of divine beauty and holiness remain; the next group, predictably, is itself erased, burned up, annihilated (Ghazäll 1998:52). These people represent the "ultimate end of those who have arrived" and are described by the word ittihäd "unification." For their identity, Ghazäll refers us to his earlier discussion in the treatise where he mentions the shatahät of al-Halläj and Bistâmi, "I am the Real" and "Glory be to me, how great is my sta tion." This ultimate station of the wäsilün has been attained by the ® This suggestion is in agreement with Griffel 2009:286 that "it is not convincing to argue, as Hava Lazarus-Yafeh did, that for al-Ghazâlï, the technical language of emana tion in Arabic had lost its emanationalist meaning."</page><page sequence="23">366 O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 Prophets Ibrahim and Muhammad, too, although, we are told, the intermediate stages were not needed by the latter (Ghazali 1998:52). Ghazall's gradation is quite revealing. If the history of kaläm pre sented in the foregoing is recalled, it is not hard to notice that Ghazall's scheme roughly matches the historical progression: the farthest from the real truth are the early Sunnis who opposed the Mutazila and affirmed God's attributes, as did the early Ash'arites, followed by the later Ash'arites (like Juwaynl, and Ghazâlï in his earlier phase) who drifted towards the Mu tazila on the issue of divine attributes; at the highest levels are not the salaf but the Neoplatonist mystic philosophers, who deny any complexity or attributes to God. The true gnosis of God is directly proportional only to one factor: how transcen dent God is when seen from the physical universe; dimensions such as worship, obedience, love, fear, righteous practice, that are dominant in the Quran and the discourses of the salaf, are entirely absent. Indeed, on this view, the Batinites, ostensibly the despised enemies Ghazali spent much of his career writing against, would be placed in the highest categories, above the salaf and certainly above their simplistic Sunni followers. The sahfaxe. not only absent from this account, but, given that none of them is recorded to have said anything about the celestial spheres, luminous lords, or about union with God, implicitly placed in the cat egory veiled by layers of darkness, well under the Neoplatonist philoso phers of various kinds, including Avicenna, his followers, and Sufi mystics. This prompts the question of whether the salaf were a ruse to sedate the commoners in Ihya or simply a case of unresolved and unre flected contradictions. Ghazali's Vro-Salaf Finale: Kalam and Iljam The resolution reached in Ihya and the elitist hierarchy hinted at in the Mishkät contrasts sharply with the teachings in Ghazâlï's very last work, Iljäm al-'awämm 'an 'ilm al-kaläm (Restraining the commoners against the science of kaläm), an alternative manuscript title for the same text being Risàia fi madhâhib ahi al-salaf (Epistle on the Teachings of the Salaf) (Griffel 2009:266). The message oí Iljäm is plain: all commoners must avoid engaging in kaläm, restrict themselves to the arguments</page><page sequence="24">O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 provided in the Qur'än, and follow the path of the salaf who also restrained the commoners from such questions. (His sweeping defini tion of "commoners" will be considered shortly.) Iljäm begins with a forceful endorsement of the school of the salaf. Know that the truth in which none endowed with wisdom may dispute is the school of the salafimadhhab al-salaf ), by which I mean the school of the Com panions and the Followers. I will describe it and its evidence in the following. 1 say: the reality of the school of the salaf, which is the truth in our view, that any among the commoners ('awâmm) who receives any of these reports [about God's attributes found in Quran or hadith] must abide by seven things. (Ghazâlï 1985:42) These are, he goes on to list: the sanctification (taqdls) of God, that is, the denial of God's corporeality; affirmation (tasdiq) of the words of the Messenger; acknowledgement of one's incapacity to understand; silence (sukùt) from asking its meanings; reticence (imsâk), that is, not to go beyond the words [of the report] by way of interpretation, rephrasing, translation into a different language, or drawing any further implica tion; restraint (kajf) from even thinking about doing so; and finally, surrendering (taslïm) their meanings to those who know {ahi ai-ma rifa), and not imagine that their meanings are not known to the Messenger of God, upon him be peace, or to the siddlqün (sing., siddïq, lit., "affirmer of truth") or awliya (Ghazâlï 1985:42). It should be noted that this view of the salaf s position is that of Ghazâlï, not necessarily corroborated by the hadith scholars or by the historical record. Elaborating on the requirement of reticence, Ghazâlî writes, "For a commoner to attempt to interpret [the words of Qur an or hadïth] by himself is prohibited. It would be like someone not good at swimming diving into the deep ocean" (Ghazâlî 1985:49). The passage that lists the commoners who must avoid interpretation ( ta'wïl ) of such reports is quite startling. In the meaning of commoners ('awämm) is included the man of letters (adlb), of grammar (nahwi:), muhaddith,faqih, mutakallim — indeed, everyone with the sole exception of those who have exclusively devoted themselves to the learning of diving in the oceans of inner knowledge (ma'rifa), spending all their lives in that pursuit, turning away from this world and its desires, from wealth, power, all creation, and all pleasures, devoting themselves to God the Most High in</page><page sequence="25">368 O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 knowledge and in deeds, abiding by all the prescriptions and etiquettes of the sharia, emptying their hearts from all else but God the Most High, in rejection and scorn not only for this world but even for the hereafter and the Highest Para dise (al-firdaws al-ala) in comparison to the love of God the Most High. Such are the divers in the ocean of inner knowledge. And even these, with all this, are in grave danger which destroys nine out of ten of them. (Ghazâlï 1985:49-50) It is peculiar here that even a mutakallim is not supposed to engage in interpretation of reports about God's attributes, leaving us to wonder what else on earth one might do as a mutakallim. The only group that has at best a ten percent chance of properly interpreting these reports consists of those who abandon not only this world but also care little about the next, except for God. This is clearly a reference to the elite Sufi ideal. The philosophers, incidentally, are entirely absent from this list. Much of the case in Iljäm, it is clear from the title, is set primarily against the other Ash'arites, especially those who would impose the obligation of speculative reasoning and metaphorical interpretation on commoners. In a pedagogical dialectic with the Ash'arites who might have found his dismantling of the Ash'arite tradition troubling, the mutakallim objector asks: What if the commoner would not incline towards the creed except by rational evidence? Ghazâlï responds that only the evidence given in the Qur an may be given to the commoner (Ghazâlï 1985:57). What is harmful and indeed a bid'a, an innovation, is what the mutakallims have undertaken beyond presenting the Quran's arguments (Ghazâlï 1985:59—60). Then Ghazâlï considers what he had given as the only defense of kaldm in his Ihya, namely, the changing times and the need for using it as a tool against newfangled heresies. He goes on to provides a surpris ing barrage of arguments against his own case in Ihya in a way that is hardly any different from that of the hadith group: kaläm is not merely unnecessary but harmful hair-splitting, which the early salaf(the Com panions) did not develop or even hint at. This silence was not because they were incapable of doing so or because they avoided all theoretical or abstract matters — for they did indeed engage in abstract matters in the domain of law — but because they truly found this type of argu mentation about theological matters harmful. Indeed, Ghazâlï writes, they needed theological arguments in arguing against the Jews and the</page><page sequence="26">O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 Christians, but they preferred using "straight Qur anic arguments fol lowed by the sword and the arrow" rather than develop or engage in kaläm (Ghazâli 1985:60). Furthermore, rational defense misguides two for each one that it may guide, while the way of the salaf was to stop at the evidence given by the Qur an and then move to "the whip and the sword" for those who did not feel convinced (Ghazalï 1985:61). This 2,nû-kalâm message in Iljäm seems to be compromised by a parenthetical discussion in which Ghazäll offers guidelines on whether and under what conditions to make one's speculation about the mean ings of verses about divine attributes public. This implicit allowance of such speculation seems to contradict the passionate and all-encompass ing warning against it that forms the crux of the treatise. This could be understood in one of three ways: it is a plain contradiction; or it is meant for those who possess the aforementioned impeccable attributes and are allowed to engage in it (in which case, we may wonder why Ghazâlî's advice is needed); or, finally, it is intended for those who can not help engaging in inescapable speculation on divine attributes and other such matters because such questions seemed endemic in his times. This last, given Ghazâlî's concern for pedagogy, seems most likely to be the case. Did Ghazâlî change his opinion between writing Ihya and Iljäm, his last work? He mentions Ihya approvingly later on in Iljäm (Ghazâlî 1985:67), which would suggest that Ghazâlî sees no conscious break from his earlier position; Iljäm is certainly not a recantation. This does not preclude a gradual increase in disillusionment with kaläm and the entire rational enterprise already palpable in Ihya, which is what I suggest to be the most plausible explanation. 71 Griffel 2009:266-267 argues that indeed Iljäm "is the work of a rationalist theolo gian, exploring how the rationalism of the religious elite can be taught to the ordinary people without causing any damage" to their afterlife or proper practice. I remain, however, unconvinced. For one, Griffel 2009:267 gives Ghazali's definition of the commoners as "all those people who have not studied rationalist theology (kaläni) and who would be unable to present arguments as to why the anthropomorphic descrip tions of God in revelation cannot literally be true." However, Ghazali's definition reproduced above explicitly includes the scholars of kaläm among the commoners, and the description of the only exception matches that of the mystics, not theologians or philosophers.</page><page sequence="27">370 O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 Without suggesting, therefore, that Ghazâlï abandoned esotericism and elitism in his last work, we may conclude that the metaphysical confidence of Mishkät and other theosophical works is a far cry from the diffidence and humility towards philosophical speculation evident in Iljäm. Unlike Ihya, where kaläm has an apologetic albeit unsafe role of defending others' faith while putting one's own faith on the line, so to say, in Iljäm kaläm plays no positive role; all one can do is to suggest remedies and controls for those given to such intellectual speculation. The attributes of God and other unseen realities are the domain of those rare mystical saints who have abandoned this world altogether and utterly devoted themselves to God, and even their chance of suc cess is no more than one in ten. The durability of the dilemmas that faced Ghazäli can be seen six centuries later in the writings of Shäh Wall Allah of Delhi (d. 1763), another tremendous intellect in the rationalist Sunni tradition who sought to create a grand synthesis of theology, philosophy, and mysti cism with similar ambition and breadth (Ansari 1985:67ff.; Bajlon 1986:200—201). In eighteenth century Delhi, distant both in time and space from the golden age of the salaf and the theological disputes of Baghdad, Wall Allah's attitude towards the Neoplatonist mystical phi losophy, that Ghazäli had only harbingered and the eastern Illumina tionist philosophy had consolidated, was much bolder and stable (see Bajlon 1986:4; Ziai 1990). A thoroughgoing Neoplatonist, Wall Allah had no qualms about recognizing the radical propositions, barely implicit but never articulated even in Ghazâlï's boldest writings, that the path of the salaf was not the only way to God, and that the paths of Sufism and theosophy (hikma) were distinct from and ultimately inde pendent of the path of the sharia (Wall Allah 1974:121-129). He con sistently considers the salaf and even the early Ash'arites as ummiyyun — gentiles, simpletons, unaware or incapable of the real mystical and philosophical truths discovered only by later theosophists like Ibn Arabi, averring in Sufism and Illuminationist philosophy a fundamen tal epistemologica! break from the traditional way of the Prophet and the salaf which the Prophet would have disliked had he known of it (Wall Allah 1964:11—19). Unlike Ghazäli, for whom the Prophet ultimately taught the otherworldliness and mystical worldview that Sufism captured, Wall Alläh, a hadtth scholar as well as a much more</page><page sequence="28">O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 polished Sufi, acknowledges that the Prophet never taught Sufism and that he would have even disapproved of it. But this does not threaten Sufism at all; in eighteenth-century India, it is the sharia, not Sufism, that needed defending. Sufism is just as valid in its capacity as a differ ent path to God than the sharia-, it is not only valid but also perhaps nobler and closer to the ultimate truth, whose epistemological founda tions and teleology (namely, its goals) are different from, even exclusive of, those of the exoteric sharia. It is hard to imagine a bolder break from the idea of the golden age of the salafznà an assertion of spiritual and intellectual progress, which nonetheless maintains the validity of the ways of the salaf, the simplistic early folk, by averring multiple paths, each with its own epistemology and set of rules. Thus, in Wall Allah, the project that Ghazâlï intimates in his bolder writings can be seen as having come to full fruition. Conclusion The tensions and conflicts in Ghazäll's corpus that have long been observed can be attributed to the ambitious synthetic nature of his project, as he tried simultaneously to embrace the cultural memory of the salaf while trying to adjust it within the Neoplatonist intellectual legacy of the Near East. The prospects of intellectual progress and the knowledge of ultimate realities that the philosophical and mystical tra ditions promised were too tempting to pass by Unlike his teacher, Juwaynï, Ghazâlï did not retreat to the way of the salaf tor the sake of safety in afterlife, nor did he, however, reach a stable alternative of his own that could daringly break away from the cultural memory of the salaf as preserved in hadïth and the early Ash'arite kaläm circles. While espousing, at least during one phase of his life, a fundamentally Avicen nan cosmology, albeit purged from doctrines he believed to be hereti cal, Ghazâlï also sought to remain a Sunni and an Ash'arite, who died a few days after having written a passionate but qualified appeal (Iljäm) for the commoners, including the theologians, to return to (what he believed to be) the way of the salaf Ghazâlï employed different tech niques in different phases of his writings to deal with the issue of the salaf from the romanticization of the salaf as perfect Sufis along with a</page><page sequence="29">372 O. Anjum / Numen 58 (2011) 344—374 qualified defense of kaläm in Ihya, to the relative negligence if not implicit denigration of the salaf with clear preference for the Neopla tonist theosophy in the more elite-oriented Mishkät, to the relatively pro-.M¿z/"finale in Iljäm. Rather than reject exoteric teachings, Ghazâli adopted an elaborate system of esotericism and pedagogical elitism in which different types of men were to be instructed in different teach ings, each layer being true in its own way. The statements of revelation must be deemed true, although they have different meanings for people of different levels; that these different meanings may presume different epistemologies, and even require different cosmologies or ontologies, does not seem to deter Ghazâli. Nor is he willing to divulge the secret of how contradictory things might all be true. In conclusion, it would seem that, at least in some cases, the "neu tralizing" of evolutionary effects and foreign elements that Chaumont (EI2 1960—2006, s.v. "al-Salafwa L-Khalaf ") attributes to the tendency he describes as "genuine traditionalism" has not taken place merely through "confident reliance on the past." Rather, much more conflict and contradiction can be seen before the keepers of tradition in poster ity selectively preserve the memory of how the "orthodox" masters themselves struggled with the still earlier memory.
