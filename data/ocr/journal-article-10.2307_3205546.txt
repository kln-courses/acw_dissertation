St. Lawrence Ccntrc for the Arts, Toronto. E;ebru- ary7 1970. I HE NE:W ST. LAWRENCE CENTRE FOR THE ARTS, Toronto's belated Centennial project, was re- cently opened with great ceremony. The fact that it was built at all, considering the opposi- tion it aroused, is something of a miraclee Be- hind its pleasant exterior, suggestive of an ele- gant urban fortress, it houses two auditoria: one called the Town Hall, seating 487 in front of an open stage, designed for community events and entertainment-lectures, rock concertsJ re- citals, teach-ins films, conferences, lunch-hour and children's programs, etc.; and one called the Theatre, a steeply raked 830-seat house with a flexible proscenium-thrust-caliper stage, tech- nically well cqu ipped for the possibilities of modern media, a theatre for drama, opera, and dance. Both auditoria are simple and even austere in appearanceX and, attractive though the lobbies are, continue that depressing trend of contemporary theatre architects to bore the audience with faintly drab surroundings until the lights go down. The repertory company for the Centre, under the artistic direction of Leon Major,- one of CanadaSs most promising (and now most estab- lished) young theatre peoplel intends to per- form five or six plays a year, with emphasis on new Canadian plays. However7 if the play that opened the Centrel Jacques Languirand's ManJ Inc. is any indication of the quality of the new Canadian plays awaiting production, the Centre should speedily forget this policy. Man, Inc., a vastly pretentious and utterly banal multi-media effortfi was a most unfortunate first choice. Com- plete with dancers, singers, three actors, a recorded electronic-folk-rock score, and an sn- genious huge screen with angled walls, ceiling, and floor? Mart, Inc. strained its bowels desper- ately to deliver profundities about the life of man. Alas, all was unrelieved constipation. The abstract film effects, devised by the press tigious National Film Board, were often im-</page><page sequence="2">318 / EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL pressive and almost always interesting, especially the Creation of the World that began the play and a sequence in which a god-like computer, winking with sinister lights, inspires orgiastic devotion in a female worshipper. Yet they had only the slightest connection with the spoken scenes (mostly unaided regrettably by film). These consisted of weary platitudes on life, man, woman, and marriage uttered in incredibly pedestrian dialogue by an actor and actress (he Adam-breadwinner, she Eve-housewife) who looked quite bored by the whole dismal affair. Possibly Languirand was not helped by the English translation of a French-Canadian origi- nal, but the poverty of his material could not have been concealed if Man, Inc. had been performed in lively Neapolitan argot. The St. Lawrence Centre was badly needed in Toronto. Now that an excellent theatre build- ing is inhabited by a permanent repertory company, we can only hope for better plays in the future. MICHAEL R. BOOTH, University of Guelph. ODYSSEY. Adapted by the Organic Theatre. Chicago. Summer, 1970. IHrJ OR(.ANIC THEATRE IS ONE OF THE NEWER GROUPS in Chicago's suddenly enlivened local theatre scene. As its name implies, it does "poor theatre." The Odyssey is performed on a bare central stage by four men and three women in tights and tank tops. With their bodies and voices they create all the settings and sound effects. The only other theatrical means em- ployed is lighting which helps to establish the rapid changes in time, place, and mood. The Odyssey is obviously a fine choice for "poor theatre"; only MGM might do it other- wise, there are so many fantastic places, crea- tures, and sea changes. The group is resourceful and the means are ample. One is made aware of how many opportunities the bare stage floor itself affords which have been so long unex- plored because the raised stage is for upright activity. Adapting and elaborating the episode in which a drunken sailor falls from Circe's roof, director Stuart Gordon sets his Cyclop's cave at a great height. On the way to it, his sailors climb a very high rocky cliff topped by a crow's nest. (All this detail and the pro- duction is rich in imagined detail- is supplied through mime and vocal effects.) Awaiting his turn to climb, the last sailor drinks wine. Once high on the ropes, he loses his toe-hold, hangs swinging for a moment as his friends desperately try to reach him, and then plummets to his death. The effect is chilling. The climb and seemingly free fall are established with the actor on the floor, his body parallel to it. The means of dramatization are boldly in- genuous. The giant Cyclops is shown as one man upon another's shoulders. His cave is estab- lished by darkness and by its entrance, which consists of two girls who face one another hold- ing hands above their heads, and by a fierce- faced man-door. The assemblage makes the sound of water dripping. For the Cyclops to enter his cave he must stoop and the girls rise on tip-toe. When Odysseus departs from the land of the Cyclops in his ship of six sailors, rowing and extending their legs for oars, the angry Cyclops grows smaller in the distance slowly lowering himself to the floor. There is nothing cute or self-conscious in any of this. The acting is intense and without artifice. The anthropomorphism is right for the Odyssey. The Cyclop's cave rises on tip-toe for him because even it must serve him, or else. Odysseus' sailors are as one with their oars. "Poor theatre" may be understood, as Grotow- ski explains, as a response to the unbeatable competition film and television provide for the means of conventional theatre. Our "poor theatre" may be further understood as an ex- pression of our youth culture, not so much in content, as in technique and form. It is inter- ested in sensation not significance, and in that which is physical and communal. The emphasis is on being, rather than on be- coming; on the moment rather than on causal, linear development. In place of the representa- tion of development we are coming to appreciate the representation of discontinuity and trans- formation. The choice of the Odyssey is in keep- ing with the general shift in emphasis. The journey home holds the episodes together but it is the episodes in themselves that are of pri- mary importance. Odysseus is the only character who appears throughout and his character does not develop. The episodic nature of the story, coupled with the small cast, necessitates numer- ous rapid changes in roles played by the other actors. And the story itself is about magical transformations: Circe turns the sailors into pigs; Odysseus returns home disguised as an old beggar and then reveals himself.</page></plain_text>
