<plain_text><page sequence="1">Contemporary African Art," hosted by the Heard Museum and Arizona State University and featuring art historians, artists, and musi- cians, brought a number of noted scholars to Phoenix. "That's ugly. It's beautiful work, but it's ugly," one visitor was overheard to say. While she may not have fully understood the object, at least she was looking at it. In this sense, the exhibition fulfilled its stated purpose, "to cre- ate in Phoenix a greater awareness of the visual arts of Africa." Lee Ann Wilson Arizona State University ASEN: IRON ALTARS OF THE FON PEOPLE OF BENIN Emory University Museum of Art and Archaeology, Atlanta, Georgia October 2-December 21, 1985 As the first in a series dedicated to "The Hu- man Condition," the newly established Emory University Museum of Art and Archaeology presented a special exhibition on asen, the metal commemorative sculptures of the Fon of Benin. Curated by Dr. Edna G. Bay of the Graduate Institute of the Liberal Arts at Emory, the exhibition of thirty-nine sculptures was based on the collection of William Arnett of Atlanta. In addition, there were three nine- teenth-century royal asen from the collection of the Historical Museum of Abomey, repre- senting the first loan to an American institu- tion by the government of the People's Repub- lic of Benin. "We are born with death," says a Fon pro- verb. The Fon believe that the living and the dead of every lineage are interdependent. As Frere Lucien writes,"...relations between the living and dead are numerous, close and...vital. For the living and dead have mutual need for each other: the living, in order to obtain aid and protection, to succeed in life in the midst of the dangers and hostile forces that surround them-these relationships to them are a means to have access to a world of higher powers and to remedy their own powerlessness-the dead, in order to be honored, and by that to be able to conduct their existence in the other world in peace and also to prolong their life in this world, through the lives of their descendants" ("A propos du culte des ancetres," Bulletin de l'Enseigenement Superieur du Benin, no. 8, pp. 63-87). Asen are richly varied visual praise poems that speak to this interdependence. According to the Fon, "An asen is a calabash on which one offers food to the dead." "An asen is an iron object to which you invite the presence of the spirit of a dead person." "Asen repre- sent our desire to venerate our fathers, our mothers, our influential elders, our ancestors." A typical asen consists of a pointed iron or steel stake topped with a hollow metal cone or series of ribs that supports a circular plat- form. On the platform is a tableau commemo- rating the person for whose spirit the asen is intended. The platform surfaces are decorated with human, animal, and plant figures in beaten iron, cast brass, or repousse, along with 9 occasional objects carved in wood, bits of bone, pieces of cloth, bottle caps, coins, and other found objects. The total height of an asen may vary from approximately 60 to 180 centi- meters, royal ones being taller and narrower than more recent twentieth-century ones. Visible on many asen in the Arnett collection were frequently occurring symbolic motifs such as the sacred snake/rainbow, Dan Aido-huedo, associated with the most powerful of the an- cestors; the cross derived from the Christian symbol, representing Mawu, the creator-god of the Fon pantheon; and the closed calabash, reminder of descendants' obligations to ances- tral figures and symbol of the Fon cosmos. Some asen suggested genre scenes associated with the life of the person memorialized. In one, six figures moved forward across the sur- face, caught in snapshot vividness, their dress illustrating in precise detail the ceremonial costuming of the followers of Heviosso. the god of thunder. Yet others incuded seemingly bizarre juxtapositions of elements whose sym- bolic meanings were in fact visual puns that reinforced messages of filial piety and pledged the support of the living for the dead. One, for example, displayed a lower leg and foot next to a large yam, a favorite staple food in the region. The Fon words for foot (afo) and yam (te, tevi) taken together suggest the phrase "N do fo te, " meaning both "I am wholly up- right," "I am totally ready," as well as "I am wholly sincere" or "wholly pure." Thus the person who offers the asen underlines his own moral and physical strength as he pledges to do all that he can on behalf of the remembered ancestor. The five sections of the exhibition were de- signed to explore the manufacture, meaning, cultural context, and stylistic variations of asen dating from the late nineteenth century to the present. Field research by the curator provided new data on the symbolism of the tableaux. Photos illustrating the manufacturing process augmented the section dealing with smiths and their symbolic signatures on the cone- shaped understructure of asen. Regional varia- tions were highlighted by the inclusion of T several elaborate wrought-iron examples from Ouidah. Finally, a reconstruction of an asen shrine helped viewers understand the function of aseni in communicating wvith the dead. This small but unique exhibition brought to light objects that are relatively little known to students of African art and increased our ap- preciation for Fon arts. It is scheduled to travel to the Grinter Galleries, University of Florida, Gainesville, February 17-March 21.

Poling Emnory University Muselum of Art and Archaeology research notes THIE MASK OF AIA The publication of Francois Neyt's stimulating comparative essay on Igala, Idoma, and Tiv sculpture (The Art of the Benue: To the Roots of Tradition, 1985) raises important issues concer- ning the historical relationship between Idoma and Igala art. I would like to add another piece of evidence to this discussion, which I un- covered during fieldwork in southern Idoma in 1978 and which typifies the complexity of the Idoma-Igala relationship. The masks of Agila and Igwumale, two southern Idoma kingdoms bordering northeast Igbo country and about 150 kilometers south- east of Idah, the Igala capital, are radically dif- ferent from those of other Idoma districts in that they are rarely carved from wood. With one or two exceptions they are either raffia or elaborate appliqued textiles that appear peri- odically to reincarnate ancestors (Kasfir in Cole &amp; Aniakor, Igbo Arts: Communlity and Cosmos, 1984). But there is one carved mask, known as Ekwaja (eklwl-Aja, "spirit of Aja"), which is owned by the Efopfu and Osiroko royal lineages of Agila and which poses an interest- ing puzzle concerning its origin. Decidedly 83 trEI_rI</page><page sequence="2">unlike other Idoma carved masks in style and iconography, Ekwaja also bears no close re- semblance to any Igala mask I have seen, in- cluding those associated with the Ata. In ad- dition it is quite unlike those in use in nearby Igbo communities. The royal line in Agila claims descent from Igala, thus legitimizing its right to rule. To rein- force this claim, which is partly historical and partly a mythical charter, a number of symbols are employed that are said to derive from Idah. One such symbol is Ekwaja, a carved and blackened female mask dressed in solid red (probably formerly ododo but now commercial) cloth and holding two brass bells, of European type but identified locally with Idah. The coif- fure of twin cones (seen not in Agila but fur- ther south) is ringed by a woven fillet into which are placed three red feathers. Prominent protruding ears are pierced by pendant ear- rings of brown glass beads, worn by all royals in Agila and also identified with Idah. The corners of the small open mouth are accen- tuated with "cat's whisker" scars (not seen in Agila today), and vertical keloids mark the forehead from hairline to the bridge of the nose. The eyes are of a cowry shape never seen in Idoma anthropomorphic masks. The pro- portions of the face are much broader than those of Idoma face masks, and more im- portant, it is not painted white but black. If there were any doubt as to the mask's gender, this is made very explicit by its owners and reinforced in performance. When Ekwaja enters the village playground, she sits motion- less until a woman spectator calls, "Oo-hoo- hoo! How beautiful you are!" She then rises and dances slowly to a complex drumbeat that differs markedly from that of other Agila mas- querades. Her title, ekwataida (ekwu-Ata-Ida), "mask of the king of Idah," makes clear her royal association. Her measured, careful stance and movement pattern reinforce this persona. The Agila people say that she impersonates Aja, the beautiful first wife of one of the Atas of Idah. The only scholar to have mentioned Ek- waja was R.G. Armstrong (Peoples of the Niger- Benue Confluence, 1955), who speculated that Aja might possibly be identified with the legendary first female Ata of Idah, rendered by Clifford as Ejaunu (i.e., Eja=Aja). But John Boston (The Igala Kingdolm, 1968) transcribes this as Ebelejonu, (i.e., Ebele-ejonu), which is linguistically too far removed to be a real possibility. Nonetheless, given the frequent claim that candidates for the kingship of Agila formerly traveled to Idah for their investiture,or at least to receive the beads of office and other regalia, the evidence of oral tradition reinforces a possi- ble Igala origin. Furthermore, the mask's style, while not close to any of the reported Igala ex- amples, bears a greater family resemblance to Igala masks than to Idoma or Igbo ones (e.g., the Egwu Ata masks in Neyt, pp. 40-42). The most perplexing aspect of this is that there appear to be no contemporary counterparts of Ekwaja in Igala kingdom itself. This does not preclude the possibility of an Igala origin, for there is a tendency for masquerades to "go to the bush" when political expediency dictates. It is therefore possible that Ekwaja is a mas- querade that once existed in Igalaland but now lives on in southern Idoma as a historical rem- nant. The alternative seems to be that it is, and always was, a local masquerade found only in Agila and invented for the express purpose of validating the royal house's cherished connec- tion to Idah. If that were so, we might expect that it would be executed in a style closer to the Idoma norm. I would be very interested in the reactions of other scholars to these spe- culations, particularly anyone who has worked in Igala. Sidney Littlefield Kasfir Middlebury College books Continued from page 27 Nebel's lithographs (1836) and Garcia Cubas's illustrations (1876) depicting the hybrid dress of the indigenous populations during this era. This section of the text features some especially well-chosen illustrations, including a number of notable pieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among these are some fine Maya textiles donated by the explorer Maudslay. These two chapters form the valuable core of the book. Many anthropologists, art histori- ans, and archaeologists who will use this vol- ume are most familiar with the archaeological past discussed in Part I and the ethnographic present of Part III. Part II successfully fills in the gaps and links the two. The text of Costumes of Mexico is divided almost equally between pre-twentieth-century and twentieth-century material. The four chap- ters of "Part III: Twentieth-Century Mexico" constitute exactly half the book. They are "Fibres, Spinning and Dyeing," "Weaving, Embroidery and Other Decorative Techniqu- es," "Contemporary Male Dress," and "Con- temporary Female Dress." Sayer seems most authoritative in the first two of these chapters, which provide an outstanding introduction to materials and techniques. She discusses with equal facility both indigenous skills and the myriad innovations to the native textile artist's repertory. The last two chapters survey male and female costume throughout Mexico. Here, the level of discourse and cursory treatment of a large body of material is best suited for a general, nonscholarly audience. Paradoxical- ly, it is these readers who may be most con- fused by these chapters, however. When the author moves from the Tarahumara and Hui- chol to the Tzeltal, Totonac, Huave, and Yuca- tec Maya in one paragraph (p.191), the reader who lacks prior familiarity with these ethnic groups and their geographic settings may have some trouble keeping up. In these two chap- ters, Sayer discusses a lot of clothing that is not illustrated, and she does not refer the reader to illustrations in other books, as is customary. This limits their value. Moreover, these two chapters do not define regional dif- ferences well, nor do they elucidate individual versus village style within regions. Yet many books published in Mexico have focused end- lessly on regional costume differences with- out providing the adequate overview and historical dimension that Sayer successfully achieves. The author sums up the volume in a brief (7 pp.) but eloquent conclusion about accul- turative forces and reasons for the gradual abandonment of traditional garb in many pue- blos. This is followed by three well-illustrated appendixes on the backstrap loom, weaving techniques, and embroidery stitches. A useful glossary of Hispanic, Indian, and weaving terms is provided as well. The volume is handsomely illustrated with numerous line drawings and photos, including a full thirty-six pages of high quality color plates. On one of the maps, the state of Chia- 84 EKWAJA MASK.
