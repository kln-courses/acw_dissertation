Department of Antiquities Work on the pyramid plateau was continued in 1937-38 in two sectors. In the first, around the valley temple of Khafre, seven Old Kingdom mastabas were discovered. One was that of Queen Ka-usert. It was a great structure, 19 meters long, 13 meters wide, and 4 meters high, partly cut in the rock and built of masonry above. The six others belonged to officials and functionaries of the palace. There were found also eight steles of Thutmose IV representing the king before various deities honored in the region of the Sphinx. Along the south wall of Khafre's funerary temple a series of Old Kingdom brick structures consisting of chambers surrounded by walls 2.5 meters thick was uncovered. To the east of these were discovered the traces of a brick temple with walls 2.5 meters thick, plastered on the inside. This temple seems to have been converted later into habitations, for the walls of chambers found in the court had been built over the bases of pillars. The clearing of the wall built by Thutmose IV to protect the Sphinx was completed. The wall was about 2.15 meters thick. The north-south road parallel to the valley temple and the Sphinx temple was further cleared and shown to be 3 meters wide. Among the vases and fragments of statues found in this vicinity, the most striking was the lower part of a diorite statue of Khafre. During this campaign, also, a large portion of a road 9 meters wide, running south along the west wall of the valley temple, was discovered. Channels cut in large granite and limestone blocks for conveying rain water from the gar- 95</page><page sequence="2">96 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES goyles of the temple roof were part of the road. Hereabouts were discovered commemorative steles on which the Sphinx was represented. In the second sector, southeast of Khafre's funerary temple, two large rock- cut tombs were unearthed. In the funerary chamber of one was a granite sarcophagus. In the other was a limestone sarcophagus around which were scattered bowls and limestone models of plates. In a pit near these tombs was found a head 30 centimeters high of a black-granite statue of a man. From a Department of Antiquities release sent by E.

Department of Antiquities After trial digging at this site near ZaqdzIq had brought to light large red-granite blocks bearing inscriptions of the Saite period, excavations were begun in October, 1937. The blocks were found to have come from within a mud-brick construction. One limestone and several red- and black- granite sarcophagi were uncovered. All had been plundered and some were broken to pieces. Some were inscribed inside with religious scenes and texts. On one were the cartouches of Nectanebo I. All were rough outside, and traces of plaster indicated that they may have been covered with limestone. A little of the limestone paving of the inclined plane down which the sar- cophagi had been lowered still remained. Portions of the walls, entrance, and pavement of the limestone chapel which had housed them were discovered. On a higher level on the north, south, and west sides of the inclosure wall were found small rectangular mud-brick chambers with vaulted roofs. These contained the skeletons of bulls lying in various positions, some of them still untouched. One of the chambers contained a number of copper implements and three small silver rods, some of them apparently used in the embalming process. This seems to have been the burial place of the sacred bull worshiped as Pa-ka-wer at Horbeit, 3 kilometers northwest of the site. Pa-ka-wer, Lord of Horbeit, is frequently mentioned and depicted as mummified on the sar- cophagi. From a Department of Antiquities release sent by E.

L'Institut Frangais du Caire The excavations north of Medinet Habu, discontinued in 1935, were re- sumed in January, 1937. Although a new temple of Ramses IV is yet to be excavated, the appendages to it were partially cleared. Certain of these ap- pendages had been built upon the foundations of the previously discovered northern "anonymous" temple. In the pavement of the latter were found re- used blocks of Ramses II. Hence, it was built between the reigns of Ramses II and Ramses IV. The discovery of the Ramses IV temple also facilitates the dating of the enlargement of the temple of Amenhotep, son of Hapu, for the inclosure wall of the latter was built upon the Ramses IV ruins. The great basin in the forecourt of the temple of Amenhotep, son of Hapu, was emptied. It had been dug through a rocky stratum 2 meters thick and into the underlying sand down to the lowest water level. It was walled with great sandstone blocks in receding courses up to the highest water level and with bricks from that point to the top. Before the doorway of the second pylon of the temple a double stairway ascended to a platform surrounding the basin. From the north side of the platform another stairway descended sharply to the water. The basin had not been used all the time that the cult of Amenhotep, son of Hapu, was celebrated in his temple. The bottom was allowed to fill up at the end of the Ramesside period, and a round well was dug at the bottom of the stairway probably in the Twenty-first Dynasty. Several interesting objects from the reign of Amenhotep III were found in the debris in the basin. Among them were a black-granite head of Amenhotep III, a stele of Amenhotep, son of Hapu, and a small bas-relief of the renowned sculptor Ipuky. Revue d'egyptologie, III (1938), 99 ff.

The archeological work centered around Hureidha in the Wady Amd, a branch of the Wady Hadhramaut. The remains of a large irrigation system were surveyed. The source of the water was the monsoon summer rain. A temple was excavated which measures 17 by 20 meters and is situated on a raised platform capping a natural eminence. More than fifty inscriptions were found which have been handed over to Professor Ryckmans of Louvain. In one of the dedicatory inscriptions the temple is referred to by the name of Madabfim, and it was devoted to the worship of the moon- god, whose name occurs on all the inscriptions so far examined by Professor Ryckmans. There are also many tombs in artificial caves. Twelve complete skulls have been preserved from what may be an ossuary. The pottery proves that all these constructions are from about the same time, and the date, though uncertain, is probably within the last few centuries before the Christian Era. Miss G.

Goerres Gesellschaft and Islamic Department, Staatlichen Museen, Berlin On March 1, 1937, the third campaign at Khirbet Minyeh on the Sea of Galilee was begun under the leadership of O. Puttrich-Reignard. The first ex- pedition in 1932 by A. E. Mader uncovered a castle-like layout with nine turrets and a huge entrance gate at the east. There was some difference of opinion as to its origin, Mader thinking it Roman and others Byzantine or Islamic. The important result of the last excavation was the discovery of a mosque and, closely joined to it, a magnificent palace. The mosque, which may be considered one of the oldest religious buildings of the Islamic world, was in entire length and breadth 13.10 by 19.42 meters. O.

Lachish (Tell ed-Duweir). Wellcome-Marston Archaeological Research Expedi- tion to the Near East As suggested in last year's report, it is now established that the great shaft at the southeast corner was never completely finished or put into use. The base of the shaft was uneven, showing where blocks had still to be cut out, and in the northwest angle a bosse of hard limestone had been left, and some natural resemblance to a human head had been increased by the crude carving of the Jewish masons. Ample evidence for two destructions by fire within a short period is avail- able inside the city. The palace-fort was destroyed during the first attack (by the Babylonians in 597 B.c.), and during the short time which intervened before the final destruction (588 B.c.) some roughly constructed houses had been built up against the palace wall. On the charred floors of these shacks two ostraca were found; one is dated "in the ninth [year]" (cf. Jer. 39:1). Under this row of rooms were the palace steps, built of soft limestone. They had replaced an earlier flight (in use 600-700 B.c.), on the top remaining riser of which a schoolboy's scribblings were found, including the first five letters of the Hebrew-Phoenician alphabet. Part of the inner city gate of the same period, with its stone threshold, has been exposed and is comparable in plan to the late gate at Megiddo. Another ostracon, in the same script as the Lachish Letters, is apparently a list of names followed by numerals, and came from the fallen debris below the southwest corner of the mound. Close by in wrecked tombs of the Nine- teenth Dynasty, fragments of pottery "slipper" coffins, with lids molded to represent human features, were recovered, and the reconstruction of the lower part of one coffin revealed part of the first hieroglyphic inscription from</page><page sequence="6">100 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Lachish-probably the work of a local scribe more familiar with hieratic than with formal hieroglyphs. Fragments of an anthropomorphic vase show a man with non-Semitic features and a small moustache. Below the northeast corner of the mound, further tombs and some early Bronze Age cave dwellings have been excavated. The latter showed the marks of stone adzes used to enlarge the natural cavities. A large cave had been a stable in the Iron Age and a potter's workshop in the Late Bronze period; un- baked sherds, pebbles for burnishing, lumps of red and yellow ocher, and pivots for the wheel illustrate the methods of the potter's craft during the most prosperous era of the city. The potter's stock in trade was stored in an adjoining cave and consisted chiefly of bowls-similar types were found in quantities in the last phase of the Eighteenth-Nineteenth Dynasty temple. The excavation of the temple and the fosse below it is now complete. The earliest levels produced a large polychrome vase, decorated with two ibex, an ibis, and a tunny fish in metopes (ca. 1550 B.c.) associated with a gigantic cooking pot, a brazier, and some "red on black" Cypriote sherds, besides many Middle Bronze Age bowls. The expedition will not work at Lachish this coming year, but will proceed with publication in London. Submitted by C. H. Inge.

The results will be interpreted in a forthcom-</page><page sequence="7">THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGICAL REPORT 101 ing article in BASOR and detailed in Part III of Explorations in Eastern Pales- tine, now being written. Excerpt from News Letter, No. 6, of the American Schools of Oriental Research, dated August 28, 1938, by Nelson Glueck. Es-Salt De Vaux and Benoit in July and August, 1937, made a careful examination of the region around es-Salt in Transjordan, from the Wady Zerka south to the northern limit of Glueck's survey of eastern Palestine. The whole area is ap- proximately 25 kilometers square. During the course of the expedition they ex- amined about sixty sites. Not a single Nabatean sherd was recovered in the area, a fact which established the northern frontier of Nabatea in Transjordan (the Nabatean territories of the Hauran and of Jebel Druze being excepted) as being a little above Madaba. Likewise not a single sherd was recovered which can be dated between the middle of Bronze II and the end of Bronze III (approximately between the eighteenth and the thirteenth century). The first important occupation of the region dates from the end of Bronze I and increases greatly at the beginning of Bronze II. The only true tells belong to this period (Tell edh-Dhahab on the east, Tell Hejaj, Tell Safut, and Reshuni). After an interruption of five or six centuries they were reoccupied at the beginning of the Iron Age, and some other sites came into being, espe- cially in the neighborhood of Salt, and in the Beqa. Occupation was intense during the whole of Iron I, diminished during Iron II, and was resumed during the Hellenistic period. There is, then, a second notable rupture in the occu- pation. Not only is the presence of Iron II often indiscernible but at that time several sites were abandoned definitely for a neighboring position. There are thus the twin sites of Tulul-edh-Dhahab, of Tell Hejaj-Sebeihi, of Reshuni- Sihan, of Khirbet Jazzier-Khirbet Suq, of Tell Safut-Safut. The density of the occupation in the Hellenistic period became still greater during the Roman and Byzantine periods. Under the Arabs, almost all the sites continued to be inhabited. But in the Ottoman epoch, with the excep- tion of Salt (which was, until the war, the principal town of Transjordan), the region was scarcely inhabited and was turned over to the Beduin. R. P. R. de Vaux, "Exploration de la region de Salt," RB, July, 1938, pp. 398-425 (illus.). Ezion-Geber (Tell el-Kheleifeh). American Schools of Oriental Research The excavations up to the present reveal five stages of occupation. The first seems to be built on virgin soil, though there may have been an earlier Ezion-Geber situated more to the east, which would be the city referred to in Exodus. Ezion-Geber I, the stratum in which the first refinery appears, is a well-built site and probably belongs to the early part of the Early Iron Age. Ia represents a period in which extensive repairs were made on the refining plant. The same method of flues was used, but new walls were built within the structure.</page><page sequence="8">102 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES II reveals a great change in the methods of refining. The flues were plugged, and new partition walls were built with another type of brick, and the whole plastered over. There was a great deal of activity in this period. It is possible that David, when he conquered Edom, destroyed Ezion-Geber, and that Solomon resurrected its business. A great deal of the pottery at Tell el-Kheleifeh belongs to the tenth century, which was the period of greatest activity in the mining and smelting sites of the Arabah. It is not known when the city was finally abandoned. III is to be dated about the eighth century. A new town was built, the remains of which are well preserved. Industry and commerce returned. IV is really only the second phase of III and is to be dated about the sev- enth century. Its history is unknown, but, when finally destroyed, the site was abandoned forever. Later the Nabateans, to control the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, built a large seaport at Aila, east of Tell el-Kheleifeh. The excavations indicate that all the strata were damaged or entirely de- stroyed by fire. The Ezion-Geber pottery has definite affinities with both the pottery of Early Iron Palestine and that of Early Iron Transjordan, though much of it can be easily distinguished from both. Particularly striking are the large quantities of crude, hand-made, friable, smoke-blackened pots, many of which were built up on a mat, and most of which have various simple types of horn and ledge handles, or combinations of both. But, when such pottery was found in conjunction with pottery which could only be Early Iron Age, it was necessary to come to the conclusion that the peculiar ledge handles of Tell el- Kheleifeh belonged to a type of Early Iron Age pottery hitherto unknown in Palestine and Transjordan. The forms and decoration of much of the finer pottery, however, do not fit exactly into any known category. The closest resemblance on the whole is with the Early Iron Age pottery of Edom. One room, which is thought to have been a store of some kind, perhaps a pottery shop, produced a large amount of fine pottery. Every jug and dish in the room had either a potter's mark on the handle or a stamped seal inscription in characters related to the familiar Phoenician-Hebrew alphabet. The central position of Ezion-Geber, on the great trade route from Arabia to Palestine, is illustrated by the discovery of an early South Arabian inscrip- tion to which a fairly exact date can be given (eighth century B.C.). The in- scription, consisting of an alif and a ?ad, was incised on a large broken jar which was found on the floor of a room in level III. The excavations have also yielded a small jug, found in an incompletely excavated room from periods III-IV. On it are six letters which probably compose the first Edomite in- scription ever discovered. The first three letters, reading from right to left, are lamedh, cayin, and mim, while the sixth is a resh or a nun. The others are questionable. One seal impression has been cleaned, and Glueck's provisional translation is: "Belonging to Qos'nl, servant of the King."</page><page sequence="9">THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGICAL REPORT 103 Nelson Glueck, "Solomon's Seaport in Ezion-Geber," Asia, October, 1938, pp. 591-95; "The First Campaign at Tell el Kheleifeh (Ezion-Geber)," BASOR, October, 1938, pp. 3-17; "King Solomon's Naval Base at Ezion-Geber," ILN, July 30, 1938, p. 212; "Ezion- Geber, Solomon's Naval Base on the Red Sea," Biblical Archaeologist, September, 1938, pp. 13-16.

Oriental Institute, University of Chicago During the month of June, 1938, the Oriental Institute's Syrian Expedi- tion made sondages on two coastal sites located about 45 kilometers north of Tripoli. M. Maurice Dunand suggested the sites and gave much appreciated aid and encouragement. The first mound, Tabbat al-Hammim, is located on the beach by Mantar village, and has been subject to dune action. With limited time and equip- ment, it was impossible to cut through the more than 4 meters depth of blown sand on the top of the mound; hence the excavated materials come from the wind-blown slopes or farther inland. These parts yielded (1) Hellenistic, (2) late Hellenic, (3) Phoenician (eighth-ninth centuries B.C.), with Syrian pottery in part strongly affected by the motifs called "Cypriote," and (4) end of Chalcolithic-Early Bronze, with sufficient pottery of known types to make the recognition possible. Probably to be associated with either the Hellen- istic or the late Hellenic periods was an L-shaped breakwater and landing dock, built of large dressed masonry units. The second mound tested, Tell Simiriyan, is some 4.5 kilometers inland, east of Tabbat al-Hammam. It proved to have been occupied throughout the Bronze Age, and, although not large, gave indications of a fairly rich Late Bronze settlement. Dunand, among others, would locate ancient Simyra on one of these two mounds. The sondages indicate no mid-Late Bronze occupation for Tabbat al-Hamm.m. Tell Simiriy~n could have been Simyra in the Bronze Age, in which case the city would have been some distance back from the sea, and has left a rather small mound. Then the Iron Age people would have moved to the probable site of the harbor of Bronze Age Simyra. In such a sense, the sondages would rather favor Dunand's recognition. Submitted by Robert J. Braidwood. (Chagar Bazar). British Museum and British School of Archaeology in Iraq Mallowan has completed his work at this site.

(El Mina, Sueidia) Excavations were carried on at this small mound on the delta of the Orontes River in the spring of 1936 and again in 1937. Ten levels or strata were dis- tinguished, dating from 800 B.C. down to shortly before 300 B.C. The river has destroyed all earlier evidences. The construction of the buildings, which were chiefly of mud-brick, shows that this was not a residential town but a port with warehouses and shops. The whole complex of buildings seems to prove a planned site, with straight streets and rectangular blocks of buildings. Probably the merchants worked here, but lived at Sabouni, an ancient site about 3 miles upstream from el- Mina, though some of the common laborers would live here. The city (Sabouni and el-Mina) was probably founded by the Greeks and existed until about the third century B.c. The date of its extinction may coincide with the foundation of the great port of Seleucia, founded by Seleucus Nikator in 301 B.C. Woolley would identify el-Mina with the ancient city of Posidium, which has hitherto been identified with Basit, farther to the south. C. L.

It was sacked and burned but later rebuilt, and survived until about 2000 B.C. Beneath one wing of the palace was a tower or platform some five hundred years older, with a hoard of treasure buried under the foundation. M. E. L.

The remains of the mound date from the Chalcolithic age, with parallels, at Aligar and Alaca Hilyiik, to Hellenistic times. While Hittite pottery is found, the Phrygian age seems to be the most important period in the history of this mound and offers significant new materials. Apparently a local chief built his fortress here. A great variety of pottery was found. Interesting scenes of fighting animals and a few human figures on clay plaques (Phrygian) were found in the palace. Mosaic ornamentation was also used. Work will continue next season.

The small shrine showed four earlier levels of building, all dated within the Early Dynastic period. To the north of this structure another sanctuary was discovered and called the Long Shrine. To the right of its elaborate mud-brick altar a headless male statue was found. Within the altar were additional examples of Early Dynastic statuary, a female figure, a bull, and a bearded cow. Across the courtway from the Long Shrine still another shrine was identified, likewise with statuary remains. Work will be continued next season in this area. During this season the massive city wall was investigated and traced at the west end of the mound. A gate leading to the temple oval was located, but excavation here had not been completed at the close of the season. Cf. previous AJSL report and BASOR, No. 71 (October, 1938), pp. 18-20.

University of Pennsylvania and American School of Oriental Research in Baghdad The short 1938 campaign, under the direction of Charles Bache, continued excavations in the northeastern section of the mound into Level XVII, in which a round house, a tholos type of building similar to the Arpachiyah structure, was found. Levels XVII, XVIII, and XIX belong to the DUbaid period but show an admixture of Samarra wares with a few sherds pointing to the Eastern Highland Zone. Two new types of pottery vessels were dis- covered in these levels. In Level XVIII a large number of burials, sunk from the level above, were found. Grave equipment included a paint palette and a child's rattle. The pottery of Level XIX showed the introduction of light-brown, un- painted, thick-walled jars and bowls. This ware may be transitional between the earlier IHalef epoch and the ,Ubaid period, which apparently began in Level XIX and continued for eight levels to and including Level XII. The Tepe Gawra sequence is the most complete record of this period of Mesopo- tamian prehistory yet recorded. Level XX belongs to the Tell I IalMf period as indicated by typical pottery finds. Another tholos also was uncovered here. The season ended before work in this level was completed. Cf. previous AJSL report and BASOR, No. 71 (October, 1938), pp. 20-23; a general survey on Tepe Gawra, including this new material, by E. A. Speiser appears in Asia, September, 1938, pp. 536-43. (Al- Ubaid). Oriental Institute, University of Chicago In January, 1937, P. Delougaz and Seton Lloyd spent a few days investi- gating the temple platform at al DUbaid in order to discover whether there existed an architectural relationship with the Khaf jeh oval temple. They succeeded in establishing a similar oval wall at al-{Ubaid which surrounded the temple platform uncovered by the previous excavations. The entrance leading through the oval wall to the platform was likewise discovered. Small finds, including seals, pottery, and clay cones, indicate that the site was inhabited down into the Early Dynastic age. Iraq, V, Part I (spring, 1938), 1-11 (illus.).

American Institute of Iranian Art and Archaeology The staff of the Persepolis Expedition explored the northern part of Luris- tan in May and June, 1938. With a caravan of eighty animals the expedition crossed the ranges between Kharsin and the northern Seimarreh River, testing spots of archeological interest. In the plain of Quh-e-Dasht the expedition found a sanctuary of the Assyrian Empire period. The results of the excavation were highly gratifying. There were hundreds of bronze pins ranging from simple specimens to highly elaborate objects with intricate "Gilgamesh scenes." Many bronze idols of animals and human beings, figurines of frit, about two hundred cylinder seals, ornamented bronze plaques, and further interesting objects occurred in the debris and in the very walls of the sanctuary. The ruins are situated at the foot of the mountain spur of Sorkh-e-Dom(-e-Lur). Burials of the Bronze Culture of Luristan were finally found at Khatun Ban in the valley of the Badavar River, in the province of Delfan. Weapons and vessels of bronze occurred in the stone cists; however, the expedition failed to uncover bronzes pertaining to the Horse Culture of Luristan. Submitted by Erich F.

The excavations of the last three years on the Persepolis terrace determined the treasury of the Achaemenian kings. The excavations of spring, 1938, continued the work in this complex, and its last corner is now being uncovered. The treasury covers the southeastern part of the terrace, between the harem and the foot of the hill to the east. In 1938 again, great numbers of broken stone vessels, royal tableware, many vessels with the inscription of Xerxes, were uncovered. There were a few more tablets, such as those previ- ously found in the treasury archives. Further fragments of vessels of ala- baster and granite from Egypt and Assur occurred in one of the huge storage halls of the treasury. The excavations of other parts of the Persepolis terrace will continue in spring, 1939. Submitted by Erich F.

One of the metal statues, measuring nearly 2 meters in height, remains largely intact. The head, which is a separate unit, may have been made in another place by another artist, very possibly a foreigner. A metal statuette, without a head, is also illustrated, as well as two stone heads. The discovery is probably the most important find of Parthian material ever made in Iran.

Hackin has now appeared on this expedition, which was previously announced in AJSL reports. Important work was accom- plished at Kapisi (now Begram) about forty-five miles north of Kabul, where pottery and bronze objects dated to the first four centuries of the Christian Era were found. To the east of Begram, in the rocky Koh-i-Pahlavan, Buddhist remains were uncovered. In the valley of Fondukistan, midway between Kabul and Bamiyan, more Buddhist remains, possibly of the sixth or seventh centuries A.D., were investigated. Connections with the earlier and later Near East are repeatedly noted in the report, and good plates offer some of the interesting materials. Cf.

Three cultural horizons, two of them well defined, were</page><page sequence="17">THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGICAL REPORT 111 identified. The upper stratum, 4 meters deep, belongs to the early Iron Age and dates to the middle of the first millennium B.C. Among the important art objects were primitive stylized figures of animals, especially sheep. The pottery included lamps in the form of ox heads, with bases shaped like two- headed rams, and vessels with effigies of rams and other animals on the handles. This site had been inhabited by a semi-settled population engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Many charred grains of wheat and barley as well as stones of the semi-wild Mongolian peach were found. Re- mains of primitive irrigation were also observed. Bones of domesticated animals included Ovis, Bos, Equus, Sus, Canis, and Camelus, and of wild ani- mals Equus onager, Canis vulpes, and Gazella subguttarosa. The dwellings were huts or dugouts. The highest level of Kaunchi Tepe represents the earliest type of fortified settlement in central Asia. The middle stratum represents an unfortified hunter-shepherd's settlement of the Bronze Age. The inventory consisted principally of bone objects: hoes, handles of implements, and spearheads and arrowheads. Many unworked bones of Bos, Equus, Ovis, and Cervus elaphus were found. In shallow pits below a tumulus foundation were flexed burials. The lowest stratum yielded interesting round-bottomed pottery, with textile impressions on the insides of the vessels. In the same region Grigoriev's expedition investigated the gorodishches at Ashimbai Tepe and Shuralisai. These date later than those of Kaunchi Tepe. Tali Barzu gorodischche, near Samarkand, was also excavated. This site, occupied by a castle, yielded materials dating from the sixth century B.C. to the eighth century A.D. The lowest strata appeared to be contemporaneous with the upper level of Kaunchi Tepe and with the Bronze Age strata from Anau. The next contained oenochoae and terra cotta figurines showing Hellenistic traits. Above lay strata revealing Buddhistic influence. A stratum representing the period from the fourth to the seventh century A.D. yielded a pottery figurine bearing motifs of Sasanian silver work. Coins with Sogdian legends dated the uppermost stratum at the beginning of the eighth century. Architectural remains were present in each stratum. The sun-baked brick structures displayed the principal characteristics of Mesopotamian archi- tecture, including the platform, the absence of wooden mold for the arch in vaulting, and the embrasure-like ventilators. Agriculture was based on artificial irrigation throughout the period of occupation. Crops and grapes were cultivated. The Khorezm Expedition (S. I. Tolstov, leader) worked in the triangle formed by the right bank of the Amu, the Sultan-Ulia Dagh range, and the river northeast of Turt-Kul. Preliminary explorations near Shabbaz verified the story from tenth-century Arabic sources that KiAth, the ancient capital of Khorezm, was washed away by the Amu. Excavations were conducted in the ruins of a fortified residence, locally known as Fil, the name also given by al-</page><page sequence="18">112 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Biruni and other Arabic chroniclers to the residence of the pre-Moslem shahs of Khorezm. Work was concentrated on the area between the ruins of Giuldursun fortress and the eastern foothills of Sultan-Ulia Dagh. In ancient times this region was intensively irrigated by a network of canals feeding a system of oases. Two ancient oases were discovered. The first, abandoned about the eighth century A.D., was 1 kilometer wide and 5 kilometers long. Berkut Kala fortress was located in the center, and at its foot were the remains of com- mercial and manufacturing settlements. Two fortifications guarded the north and south ends of the oasis. The entire area was occupied by small fortified farms of local peasants. Approximately sixty farms were examined, although only one was excavated. Resting on a massive clay foundation, in the center of a ring of dwellings and service structures, was a tower, approxi- mately 4 meters high, which served as a food and water cache and was used as a shelter in case of attack. Its nearest parallel is found in the similar towers of the Caucasus. This building plan is also followed in the larger castles of the Khorezm grandees. Two tenth- or eleventh-century houses, one with seven rooms, the other with four, were excavated near Narindzhan-baba. Twenty-eight tombs, some Moslem and a few non-Moslem, were uncovered. Some of the skeletons (probably eighth or ninth century) were dismembered. Extremely well-preserved organic remains (leather, wood, reeds, feathers, and seeds of cultivated plants, etc.) furnished valuable evidence for the char- acter of the inhabitants' everyday life. Coins of pre-Moslem periods, many bronze arrowheads of Scythian type, iron arrowheads, buckles, beads, and other objects (all fifth-eighth century) came to light. Excavations at Giuldur- sun oasis (where Kavat Kaly fortress is located) revealed dwellings and service structures dating from the tenth to the twelfth century. About two hundred coins (from the beginning of the Christian Era to the fourteenth century A.D.) and Scythian arrowheads were unearthed. Of particular interest among the finds of this expedition are one hundred and fifty pre-Moslem coins, which are new to science. They bear the effigies of a series of Khorezm shahs, and the legends are in the hitherto unknown Khorezm alphabet. During 1937 the Kazakhstan Expedition of the Institute of the History of Material Culture (A. A. Jessen, leader) continued the survey of ancient mining and metallurgy. The expedition traversed a distance of fifteen hundred kilometers through the Kolba-Narym Mountains. Ancient beds of tin were discovered. It was established that tin mining began in the first millennium B.C. Rock-paintings of the style of Pazyryk burials were found, and the ruins of a Buddhist temple and a late Djungarian fortification at Ablankit were studied. An archeological map of the region was prepared. Report by Dr. Henry Field, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, and Eugene Prostov, Iowa State College Library, Ames, Iowa.
