<plain_text><page sequence="1">Corpus Signorum Imperii Romani. Great Britain I, I. Corbridge, Hadrian's Wall East of the North Tyne. By E. J. Phillips. Oxford University Press, 1977. PP. 135, 95 pls. Price: ?22.50. ISBN o 19 725954 5. The international programme for publication of the Corpus of Sculpture of the Roman World is a mammoth undertaking, and such creatures move slowly. Austrian and German parts of the Corpus have gradually been heaving into sight since 1967, and there have been fascicules on Roman sculpture in Poland and on the British Museum's Cyrenaica collection. The volume here reviewed is the first which deals with the stone sculpture from Roman Britain. There are three main parts to the work: I, Corbridge, accounting for just over half the total of 355 items catalogued; II, Hadrian's Wall east of the North Tyne; and III, comprising 20 unprovenanced stones in the Museum of Antiquities at Newcastle. Within each part, the material is arranged according to its subject: Deities (Graeco-Roman, Oriental, Romano-Celtic); Funerary Monuments; Building Records; Altars to Unknown Deities; Unidentified Anthropomorphic Figures; Miscellaneous Animals; Miscellaneous Sculptures. There is a photograph of each item, save where a piece is now lost and no earlier drawing exists to be reproduced. The photographs are mostly the author's, well-lit and well-printed: such few exceptions as nos. 3 I (identified as a head of Minerva), 39 and 40 (Victories)</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 443 are lumps of stone which would defy any photographer's skill. The catalogue entries are admirably thorough, following the format established as standard for the Corpus. Professor Harrison, in his Foreword, is fully justified in expressing gratitude 'for this exemplary study which will serve as a model for other Romano-British fascicules'. Its value will be felt particularly in that at last we have the rich Corbridge collection published as a whole. The site accounts for 41 of the 51 previously unpublished items which I have counted in the volume, and these are not all trunkless legs of stone of such little intrinsic importance as to excuse their previous neglect. There is, for example, a relief of three Matres (no. 63), as well as two more from Halton Chesters (nos. 240 and 24 I), and there are several male and female heads, of which nos. I 19 and 129 are of some quality. Previously, publication and illustration of many of the Corbridge pieces has been inconveniently dispersed in Forster and Knowles' annual excavation reports; Richmond, of course, collected the most significant of them together for discussion in his important paper in Arch. Ael.4 (1943), and some of them have received further individual attention elsewhere, notably from Toynbee. The overall view of the collection which is now given to us emphasizes the contrast between the sustained Romanitas which inspired the Corbridge sculpture (exemplified by the Wolf and Twins pediment and reliefs of Dioscuri and Genii), and the immense variety in the standards of its execution, at times vital and inventive, at others falling well short of mediocrity. The book also constitutes an important work of scholarship extending beyond the considerable labour involved in the preparation of a sound basic catalogue. It contains much more detailed dis- cussion of individual items than has been the practice in many of the other CSIR fascicules, all but one of which are considerably slimmer. The discussion contains much that is new; as one example, the gravestone of Regina from South Shields (no. 247) is well known for its Palmyrene inscription and decorative features. Phillips here calls attention to other features which are not typically Palmyrene, but western; and he adduces new evidence for a date in the second half of the second rather than in the third century. It is on matters of date, however, that one might venture a note of criticism. Few items have been found in a well-stratified and closely dated archaeological context. Apart from inscriptions datable on internal evidence, most pieces, as Phillips himself says, 'manifest no readily datable peculiarities of style' and are essentially undatable, other than as Roman. It might be thought preferable to admit it, and thus distinguish them from the cases where there is positive evidence on the point, rather than to offer '2nd or 3rd cent. A.D.' on the basis of the circumstantial knowledge that the site was then occupied and on the implicit supposition that little carving was done in the fourth century. It is perhaps a little disappointing that the Introduction is restricted to generalities about the Roman occupation of the area, epigraphical features and the constraints of the archaeological evidence. These remarks are discerning, and their judicious caution should well be borne in mind by those who will study the evidence so usefully made available to them in the pages which follow. One might, however, have wished for a more general commentary to bring together some of the illuminating insights offered in discussion of individual pieces. Admittedly, such a wish is motivated by greed; what we have contains much cause for satisfaction and congratulation. University of Kent at Canterbury T. F. C. BLAGG</page></plain_text>
