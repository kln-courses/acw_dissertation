<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sanctuary of Silence: The Priestly Torah and the Holiness School, by Israel Knohl. Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995. Pp. x + 246. $28.00. The present volume is a revision of Knohl's dissertation, which was completed under the supervision of Moshe Greenberg at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1988. The book investigates the "literary status and conceptual uniqueness" of the Holi- ness material in the Pentateuch (p. 6). Knohl argues that texts generally ascribed to "the Priestly traditions" actually reflect two separate and independent Priestly schools: the Priestly Torah (PT) and the Holiness School (HS). HS, written after PT, is responsible for (1) editing the legal scrolls of PT, (2) blending them with the non-priestly material, and (3) editing the whole of the Torah (p. 6). The argument has three parts: (1) the sep- aration of PT and HS (pp. 8-123), (2) a discussion of the distinctive theological and con- ceptual positions of PT and HS (pp. 124-98), and (3) a brief discussion of the origins of PT and HS (pp. 199-230). Knohl begins his investigation with an analysis of the Sabbath and festival instruc- tions in Leviticus 23 and related texts. This leads to a delineation of the distinctive lin- guisticfeatures of PT and HS (a tabular summary is located on pp. 108-10). Examples of specific HS formulations include first person address by God to the people, the phrase "an eternal law throughout your generations" (Excursus 1, pp. 46-55), laws that include both the Israelite citizen and the resident stranger, and ritual instructions grounded either in historical events or processes of nature. Knohl argues that both PT and HS reflect multiple historical layers and that HS edited earlier PT traditions. HS material, however, is not limited to the Holiness Code but is present, with the possible exception of Genesis, throughout the Pentateuch (a summary is located on pp. 104-6). HS editorial activity is characterized by transition passages, the blending of Priestly and non-Priestly language (HS draws on JE language), and marked affinities for the language of Ezekiel. HS completed the final editing of Exodus, Leviticus, and Num- bers, added the book of Deuteronomy, and, finally, edited the whole Torah book (p. 103). Following the separation of PT and HS, Knohl undertakes a descriptive analysis of the conceptual and theological dynamics of each (PT, pp. 124-64; HS, pp. 168-98). PT distinguishes between the "time of Genesis" and the "time of Moses." In Genesis, God addresses humanity directly and is depicted with anthropomorphic and personal lan- guage. God is concerned both with human needs and the well-being of the created order. Principles of justice and righteousness provide the universal and eternal law of creation.</page><page sequence="2">120 Journal of Biblical Literature Following the revelation of the divine name to Moses, however, PT shifts to an imper- sonal depiction of God. God commands Israel to worship without any thought of blessing or reward so that worship is completely separated from human life and need. At the heart of the PT cult are the commandments concerning worship and the divine demand for holiness. For PT, holiness is a ritual category completely devoid of moral content. Guilt arises, not from particular sins, but when humans face the sublimity of God's holiness. Atonement is accomplished through the priestly enactment of the rituals and has a "technical-impersonal" nature that does not require a response from God. For Knohl, PT is an esoteric document produced by priestly circles concerned with knowledge of "higher things" (p. 157) and achieves a level of abstraction and loftiness unequaled in Judaism until its conflict with philosophical thought in the Middle Ages (p. 222). In contrast to PT, HS seeks to merge priestly and popular forms of religion. HS opens with the revelation of the divine name in Exod 6:2-3. It uses anthropomorphic language to depict God in direct contact with the nation and shows God personally involved in both blessing and punishment. HS believes that Israel is the recipient of a special covenant with Yahweh which is based on reciprocity and emphasizes both the nation's call to obedience and Yahweh's acts of blessing. A very important innovation of HS is the merging of cult and morality. HS believes that offenses against human beings constitute, at the same time, offenses against Yahweh. HS includes both the people and the land in the realm of holiness and ongoing obedience to the commandments of God provides the means for Israel to be holy. The third part of the argument seeks to determine the origins of PT and HS (pp. 199-224). Knohl surveys the content of the Holiness Code and argues that it was formu- lated as a response to (1) the incursion into Israel of idolatrous practices, especially Molech worship, (2) the development of economic and social polarization that resulted in the uprooting and enslavement of farmers, and (3) the detachment of morality from the cult. Drawing on texts located in prophetic books, especially Isaiah, and the histori- cal books, Knohl argues that the Holiness Code was written in Jerusalem between the years of 743 (after Ahaz's rise to power) and 701 BCE (p. 209). Its innovations are specif- ically reflected in the reforms of Hezekiah. The work of HS continues into the Babylo- nian exile and the return from exile with the final editing of the Torah book. PT came into existence between the construction of Solomon's temple and the reign of Ahaz and Hezekiah. The background for the rise of PT was the establishment of the "King's Temple" in Jerusalem and the creation of a closed, elitist Priestly class dependent on royal support (p. 221). Knohl's argument for two distinct "Priestly" schools is convincing, as is the sugges- tion that both PT and HS reflect multiple layers. The discussion of the theological dynamics of PT and HS is very suggestive, although one might question whether the PT "scrolls" actually provide enough information for such a precise reconstruction of PT's theological dynamics. Several of Knohl's examples of HS editing of PT materials are sug- gestive, although more extensive work is needed in this area. Finally, the arguments for the early date of PT, the eighth-century origin of HS, and the final HS editing of the Torah book are problematic. In part, the problems are inherent in the current status of the discipline: What counts as evidence in determining the date of pentateuchal tradi- tions? Knohl's arguments must be viewed, in part, as an effort to provide methodological direction for future work. In this regard, one would have expected more serious dia-</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 121 logue with recent works that argue for an exilic Yahwist and/or significant Deutero- nomic/Deuteronomistic editing of the Pentateuch. This is, however, an extremely important and stimulating work with implications not only for priestly studies but for pentateuchal studies in general. Frank H.
