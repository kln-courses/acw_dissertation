Revised December 2008) ABSTRACT This paper considers the imagery, social context and meaning of the rock art of Pedra do Feitiço, a farmer rock engraving site on the banks of the Zaire (Congo) River in northern Angola. The art is examined through the recordings and texts made by Captain ]. Tuckey in 1818. This information is supplemented with more than five centuries of historical reports relating to the indigenous beliefs and practices of this area. This knowledge is applied to the rock art so as to provide new understandings of the records of Tuckey anda reinterpretation of some of the images at this site. Keywords: Angola, rock art, African religion, oral tradition, historical records. INTRODUCTION Ancient rock art has often fascinated researchers because of the constant challenge that it represents, be it with the meaning of the images or the motivation of the artists who made it. Concerning the artists' motivation, the information ob- tained from some modern populations in Africa, America or Australia allows the identification of concepts about the social function that the authors of the paintings or engravings held in their society. On other continents, where the tradition of paint- ing on rock surfaces disappeared millennia ago, only hypothe- ses are possible. With regard to the meaning of the painted and the engraved figures, the situation is similar: in regions where the art is very ancient, extremely varied hypotheses have been formulated to try and understand one or many messages trans- mitted by the rock art. In regions where rock art is still made, it is possible to learn the meaning of some figures and scenes. Research into the meaning of ancient rock art has taken different routes depending on the places and the authors. In Europe, for example, the approach that Max Raphaël developed in the 1940s for Palaeolithic paintings is that "they initially tell us that Man represented the social unit of his group by repre- senting animals" because "of the prohibition (which was not absolute) to represent human beings" (Raphaël 1945). There- fore, according to Raphaël, the animals could represent groups of men or clans, and certain signs placed between these figures could represent an alliance between the animals. The concep- tions of Raphaël also led to a consideration of the painted walls as sets that must be read as a whole rather than as just a juxta- position of figures (Raphaël 1945). Other researchers subsequently developed hypotheses from Raphael's approach, adding an important role to the choice of the figures in relation to the topography of the painted or engraved galleries. The analysis of a vast sample of rock art sites allowed André Leroi-Gourhan to state that "the cave appears as a truly organized world" (Leroi-Gourhan 1964). From the analysis of the organization of the signs and animals, he confirmed the existence of a religious system: "it is impossible to imagine that the signs and the animals belonged to different religious systems", but rather "to a unique symbolic system" (ibid.). The analysis of rock art led to greater consider- ation of ancient religion: " . . .the Palaeolithic religion reached us through its figurative summit" (ibid.). Still in Europe, Marcel Otte, for example, saw Palaeolithic art as "religious art" and the structure of the figures as "the result of an exchange between the impact of a population deeply impregnated with the sacred and the infinite variety of natural cavities..." (Otte 1993). In Africa, many attempts to explain paintings and engrav- ings followed one another, often with limited success since the continent is large, the manifestations varied, and the time span of the artistic creation long1. One of the first missionaries to have seen cave paintings in the mountains of the Drakensberg, Thomas Arbousset, indicated in 1840 that the authors of the paintings were San people, whom he named in Sesotho as Moroa. He added that the aim of the painters was "to leave a trace of his primitive art so as to teach foreigners who visit these enchanting places that he himself knew" (Arbousset [1842] 2000). The first site that Arbousset visited was Majoé-a-Machou, a few days later he saw paintings at the site of Liphofung and commented: "in a cave of the high Maloti where the walls are covered with portraits of antelopes painted in black, in white and in red by Bushmen" (ibid.). From the beginning the authors of the cave paintings of this part of Africa have been identified as San. Later, a part of the meaning of the paintings was learnt from observations provided by San themselves. The best known case is that of Qing, the San guide of Joseph Millerd Orpen who, in 1873, explained, among other things, the function of the hybrid therianthropic characters part-man, part-animal, which are numerous on the painted rock walls of South Africa (Orpen 1874). For the San, the role of the paintings was connected with the values and beliefs of their people. Later, these same figures, the therianthropes, gave rise to varied theories about the inter- pretation of the rock art, some authors leaning toward shamanic practices, others studying San mythology so as to understand the deeper meanings of the rock art compositions2. In the article that I present here, I also endeavour to under- stand better the deeper meanings of rock art compositions. For this purpose, I use some old recordings from a farmer rock art site in the north of Angola, Pedra do Feitiço; information provided by Captain J. Tuckey, who published the first record- ings of the site; information on religious beliefs from this part of Angola, and artefacts kept in museums. THE SITE The site of Pedra do Feitiço lies in the north of Angola, on the south bank of the Zaire River (Fig. 1). The site was discovered and published at the beginning of the nineteenth century by an English seaman who prospected the area. In 1818, J. Tuckey reported the existence of figures</page><page sequence="2">52 South African Archaeological Bulletin 64 (189): 51-60, 2009 FIG. 1. Map of Angola. The circle shows the area of Pedra do Feitiço. engraved on a rock near a village called Noki. Later, Carlos Ervedosa (1980) published Tucke/s recordings in a book devoted to the archaeology of Angola3. Since 1996, 1 have published a book and several articles devoted to the rock art of Angola, including this site (e.g. Gutierrez 1996a,b, 1998, 2000, 2001b, 2002). According to Tuckey' s publication, the site of Pedra do Feitiço has two panels with many images, where human figures, animals, ships, litters, geometrical figures, and others difficult to interpret can be observed (Fig. 2). Human characters are present: some on litters (or palanquins), some holding these litters, some facing animals, others on a boat, and finally some showing protrusions from or additions to the head, supernu- merary arms, or arms likely wielding guns. Saurians, a snake, quadrupeds, a probable cetacean count among the recognizable animals, but many of the zoomorphic figures are difficult to identify. Some animals are shown in association with other animals, with humans, or on their own. Besides anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, there are also geometrical figures, such as squares, lozenges, double lozenges, and composite forms. Finally, a probable dugout canoe (or pirogue) and a possible sailing ship are engraved on the rock. Some figures appear to represent scenes or individuals in action: characters carrying a litter (Fig. 2: 20) seem to move towards the left with two individuals standing on the litter. Others seem to interact with animals, in one case presenting them with objects on a 'tray' as if as an offering (Fig. 2: 24). A group of individuals seem to speak to, salute or face another individual; one carries an object on his/her shoulders (a ploughing tool?) and an object in the hand near the head (Fig. 2: 8, 9). Among the engraved scenes it is common to find individuals together with animals. One of them seems to be armed with a rifle, facing a quadruped (Fig. 2: 18), and another appears to beat violently a creature that may be a cetacean (Fig. 2: 15). The engraved figures and their actions raise a series of interpretation difficulties. Our capacity to recognize, without ambiguity, any of the animals or geometrical forms is limited on the one hand by the quality of the graphic reproduction and, on the other hand, by the schematic nature of the artistry whereby it appears that exact replication of reality was not the goal. This raises the question: has the man or the woman who made these figures faithfully represented the natural form of the animals or has a social system influenced the way the subjects were represented? A part of the answer to this lies in the commentary that Tuckey published, because he indicates that these figures were made by a religious man from the area: a gangan. We shall come back to the other regional information collected by Tuckey, but first let us first look at these African priests or gangan. INFORMATION FROM OLD RECORDS In a book written by Filippo Pigafetta in 1591 based on information reported by Duarte Lopes, a Portuguese trader who lived in Africa, we learn of certain measures taken by the Congolese authorities after the king of Congo converted to</page><page sequence="3">South African Archaeological Bulletin 64 (189): 51-60, 20095 53 I- 4 ! I- 1 1 I 'Í</page><page sequence="4">54 South African Archaeological Bulletin 64 (189): 51-60, 2009 Christianity. Among these measures was the incineration of cult objects: "it is remarkable that in less than one month the idols were brought to the court, the devilries, the masks, and all the objects which were adored and held for gods" (Pigafetta 2002 [1591]). The gods in question seem to have been numerous "because everyone honoured the god whom he liked, without rule, nor restraint or reason of any sort"; their forms also seems to have been very varied: "many people venerated winged dragons that they set up in their own house", others "adored snakes of horrible appearance, or large goats, or leopards, or more monstrous animals". Living creatures seem to have been of particular significance to the Congolese as the authors go on to indicate that "these people choose grass snakes, snakes, animals, birds, grasses and trees as gods", and also that they make idols of them: "various figures made of wood and stone, representa- tions of the things enumerated above, painted or cut in wood, rock or any other material" (ibid.). Pigafetta is much less informative about the men who led the religion, he only indicates that the "pagans, [the mucicongo] also had their magicians, who deceived these ignorant people by making them believe that the idols could speak" (ibid.). He adds that these "magicians" played a part in the healing of diseases because "if they managed to heal, they would say that it was the work of the idols" but if the patient did not get better, it was explained as being because "the idols were irritated" (ibid.). Although quite generic, Pigafetta' s information records the existence of certain beliefs, the presence of statues to represent divinities, and the existence of priests who were in charge of religious practices that included the healing of diseases. More- over, living creatures seem to have been important in Congolese beliefs and sculptures. In a bulky work devoted to the history of the wars in Angola, Antonio de Oliveira de Cadornega reported, in 1626, on the existence of religious practices in Angola and in the kingdom of Congo. He indicated, for example, the existence of the worship of idols, without bothering to describe them, and he noted the existence of quicullos, which are the bones of certain ancestors that the inhabitants held "in great veneration" and to which offerings of food and alcohol were made: "the quicullos eat one thing and drink another" (Cadornega 1972). The Portuguese word feiticeiro (medicine-man) is often used to refer to the people in charge of the beliefs. Sometimes the king himself is called quimpaco "which in the Muxicongo language means medicine-man" (ibid.). Cadornega indicates that king Dom Affonso converted to Christianity and invited his people to destroy the idols, while Dom Garcia II is regarded as "quimpaco" or "feiticeiro" (ibid.). The medicine-men in question probably had powers, "with their devilries", to stop rain and to deflect rain showers and thunder. For rain ceremonies they used a fly whisk made with the tail of a horse or an ox. Details are also provided on the use of plants, but here too the devil is invoked as the author says that these plants are used "with the assistance of the devil". The plants would also have been used by the gangas or medicine- men to transform themselves into a lion, a leopard or other big cats4. Some creatures, such as lizards, are also mentioned, but their use is not well explained. The skin of one of these reptiles, stuffed with grass, is reported to have been used as a protection against the bite of savage beasts. This object was called xillos (ibid.). Cadornega' s information is important but there are no illustrations of the objects of worship and, other than the xillos, the 'idols' are seldom described. Another source of important information is the report of an ecclesiastic who lived in the north of Angola: Jérôme de Montesarchio, a priest, a Capuchin, and an Italian apostolic missionary. In 1648, he arrived at Soyo, in the north of present-day Angola but at that time in the king- dom of Congo, and stayed there for 20 years to convert the Afri- can populations to Christianity. On his way back to Europe in 1668, he wrote a report on his actions in the field, and died one year later, in 1669. His activities in Africa took place in the north of Angola, in the current province of Zaire, close to the rock art site that is the subject of this paper. The information that de Montesarchio provides on the regional religions is therefore important, although his fight to impose his religion makes his analyses very subjective, even pejorative, about the practices of others. As soon as he arrived, he fought concubinage and imposed the "marriage sacrament". He also baptized with a fire hose "more than a hundred souls" (Congolese). He heard confes- sions, although this activity was slightly more complex, as he did not speak the language and had to resort to a translator. As for the "souls" that he baptized, he said that they were "can- nibals accustomed to eating human flesh. They said that after their baptism they would not eat it any more". He moved from village to village and often the inhabitants offered him hospi- tality. He then discovered their houses and, to his surprise: "in the morning, looking around me, in the hut, there was a great amount of superstitious objects; I could not believe my eyes, and particularly one statuette. It was the house of a fa- mous medicine-man. I smashed all that to pieces". He de- stroyed all the objects that he found, sometimes with weapons, sometimes with fire. He said "I met many idols and supersti- tious objects that I burned, not without meeting some resis- tance. I burned, in particular, a big idol covered with a great quantity of superstitious symbols" (Fig. 3). Resistance is some- times mentioned in his report: "the owner of these idols, a nganga ngombo or medicine-man, was very irritated. To calm him down and humiliate him, I had him told that if he persisted in being irritated I would have him burn with his idols" (Bouveignes &amp; Cuvelier 1951). Figure 3 shows an nkisi, from the collection of the Museum of Tervuren in Belgium, which could correspond to the "idol covered with a great quantity of super- stitious symbols". Information about the objects that he destroyed is scant. He sometimes calls them biteke, sometimes nkisi, but without indicating the difference between the two terms. Close to the village of Batta he burned "chinpassi" , which are the objects used by a 'sect' whose members are known as nganganchita. He says that "their chinpassi was their god". Despite that, he burned sixty of them! The description of the objects is often absent from de Montesarchio' s narration. He talks about idols, or diabolic objects, but without describing them. I found only one descrip- tion. He says: "...close to a house in the open, I discovered an idol looking like a calf. I burned it. The owner was not happy. He showed it by standing in front of me with a bow armed with an arrow". In another village, he took and destroyed a drum, ngoma, which could be an instrument of a "medicine-man". He also talks about "medicine-men's instruments and rattles". These men are alternatively called nganga, medicine-men, and nganga-nsasi, without indicating the functions that these different names cover. In one case, he indicates that the nganga nsasi of the village of Npete "pretends to cause thunder with his diabolic art" and for this he uses idols5. The lack of descrip- tions of the idols in question does not prevent us from knowing that the regional beliefs had material supports, most probably statuettes made out of wood and objects made of other perish-</page><page sequence="5">South African Archaeological Bulletin 64 (189): 51-60, 20095 55 FIG. 3. Nkisi nsumbu (from Van Wing 1938). able materials, even musical instruments. Another source of information about this part of the country is a work published at the end of the seventeenth century by a Capuchin priest, Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi de Montecuccolo (1965 [1687]). The author tells, among other things, of the diffi- culties that European missionaries faced in establishing their religion in the kingdom of Congo and nearby areas, therefore close to the rock art site that concerns us here. The author approaches the description of African religions in a very pejo- rative way and systematically classifies the African men linked to the religion as " medicine-men" and the African divinities as " demons", "devilries" and the like. However, the information that he reports is important. He indicates, for example, that the European missionaries had difficulties eradicating the African religions and the people in charge: when "the medicine-men are expelled from an area, they take refuge in another, and there is always somebody to welcome them", and when they have no other solution, "they hide in the forest, always followed by supporters". Also, there are many people who come to see them "to obtain the healing of their illnesses with superstitious drugs" (ibid.). These multifunctional "medicine-men" were called nganga- itique, and, according to Cavazzi, they mimic "the authority of the minister of Satan". The author also indicates that the nganga practised his job with the assistance of statues "which are idols", some of them intended to heal diseases. When the nganga went to work, he was loaded with idols that he placed on the walls of the patient's house "like dolls hanged on the walls", and that the author saw personally. He adds that these statues were made out of wood and that they could have the appearance of a man or a woman, and that others looked like animals, monsters, or demons. It is also the nganga-itique who decided on the days for the solemn sacrifices, which were accomplished with "barbarous and indecent ceremonies". Although tinged with the prejudices of his time, Cavazzi indicates unambiguously that the nganga was the intermediary between the people and the idols. He also states that all nganga were not at the same level. The supreme chief, for example, was the quitome or quitombe, and was the object of special attention. Certain food was reserved for him and he was quite affluent. The second in the hierarchy was the ngombo, whose characteristic feature was to walk on his hands, with his legs in the air, "making extravagant, and in particular obscene, things" (ibid.). He had the power to predict the future and to heal certain diseases. Cavazzi tells about several nganga who had particular powers: the nganga ngochi was related to oracles, the nganga mpindi was concerned with atmospheric phenomena, such as bringing rain and managing thunder, the nganga muloco protected from death caused by lightning. An interesting nganga was the ntinu-à-maza (king of water). He did not put his idols in an altar like the majority of his fellow medicine-men, but hid them in riverbeds. To recover them he used a calabash that he threw into the water, invoking admiration among his faithful. He was also in charge of healing diseases. Although "idols", statues, and other "devilries" are often mentioned in the work of Cavazzi, the descriptions of the objects are scant. However, when he speaks of a healer called Ngazi, he indicates that this man used "four small idols, including a small bell and other trinkets". Elsewhere, he mentions fragments of wood "coarsely worked and painted, like statue sketches, those indeed are idols" (ibid.). From Cavazzi' s information we de- duce that a religious hierarchy still existed in the kingdom of Congo in the seventeenth century, that the roles of the nganga were multiple, and that African divinities were represented with wooden statues. MODERN INFORMATION To this information we can add the data provided three centuries later by Father Père Van Wing whose research was concentrated upon the religion of Bakongo (Van Wing 1938). Van Wing describes the principal forms of religion and magic in this part of Africa and allows us to gain a better understanding of some of the assertions in the ancient chronicles. Van Wing explains the function of the nganga and nkisi, 'the fetishes'. The nganga plays the role of a soothsayer and healer: he heals, he protects. He takes care of accidents caused by lightning and snake bites, both of which are punishments from God, Nzambi. But his functions do not stop there because he also makes the cult objects, the nkisi, to operate effectively. Van Wing indicates that an nkisi "is an artificial object allegedly inhabited by a spirit or a soul, a dead person who is under the domination of a man". Moreover, each nkisi has a function of its own. The manufacture of nkisi is a complex matter as, on the one hand, there is the object and, on the other, there is the content, 'the spirit'. Van Wing reports that the principal element in the manufacture is "clay taken from the bottom of a river or from a pond, the abode of the spirits of the dead". The author adds that the spirit who lives in the nkisi is "supposed to have been tombuka, taken out of the water by the ancestor of the nganga (medicine-man) who currently owns it". Water, rivers and clay are therefore fundamental elements in the regional beliefs. Van Wing also mentions that "water is the place of the spirits" and that clay "is the fundamental element of all nkisi, because it is with this that an nkisi is raised out of water". It is</page><page sequence="6">56 South African Archaeological Bulletin 64 (189): 51-60, 2009 FIG. 4. Nkisi Kapiangu (from Van Wing 1938). important to remember that the site of Pedra do Feitiço is on the edge of the river and that the engravings, according to Tuckey, "seem to have been formed with ashes and sand still wet" (op. cit.). Wing's information allows a better understanding of the use of the "sand" that was noted by Tuckey. About the functions of the nkisi, Van Wing indicates that there are nkisi "to obtain fecundity, to help the woman in labour, to support the cultures, fishing or hunting", but there are some which can "both heal the patient and communicate the disease to the author of the evil spell". This probably explains the use of the term 'diabolic' by the sixteenth and seventeenth century authors. In Tuckey's description, he talks about teaching and the "wages" of the nganga. Van Wing also makes notes about these matters; he says that the pupils of the nganga "compensate their teacher for the training they receive from him". The compensa- tion is "a basket of bananas, a hen, a goat, a gun and twenty-five francs" and, at this price, "the taboos of the fetish will be revealed to him". The training includes information on the taboos around each nkisi as well as the food interdicts that result from the possession of a statue. This received knowledge will allow the pupil to use effectively his nkisi. It is important to add that some nkisi may be statues with human shape where a spirit was 'incarnated'; in other cases an antelope horn, or another object, could be the seat of the spirit. The external shape may therefore be of secondary importance. However, Van Wing publishes illustrations of 'fetishes' that include some anthropomorphic statues, for example, kapiangu. I pub- lish here some illustrations by Van Wing, that illustrate fetishes in the collections of the Museum of Tervuren in Belgium (Fig.4)6. FIG. 5. Nkisi with nails. MUSEUM ARTEFACTS Besides these artefacts from Tervuren, there are also other objects that can help us to understand better the old texts with no illustration. These are other museum artefacts from this part of Africa that are directly connected with our subject. They are mostly artefacts collected close to the Atlantic coast in the Congo-Zaire-Angola area and are often classified under the name of nkisi. For some of these objects, the collectors wrote descriptions and I review some of them here. Among the objects collected in Africa by Father Constant Tastevin in 1930, later donated to the Musée de l'Homme and now at the Quai Branly Museum in Paris, there are short descriptions of some objects. For example, about a carved ivory point, Tastevin notes that the object was used "to contain powders: tobacco or magic drugs" and that it "had been taken from the owner because it is a fetish". There are also ivory statu- ettes, one of which "represents the queen of Ngoyo, driven out of her kingdom and forced to give birth in the bush, to the hero of the Hoyos' tribe, the first Ma N'goyo. The statuette was confiscated as a fetish by an indigenous catholic priest, the abbot Lourenço Mambuco, missionary in Cabinda7. Nails statuettes are also described. Iron nails were inserted to obtain "either the prosperity of one's own field or the sterility of one's enemy". Tastevin says that it is a human figure (with nails), but there are also animals with nails, some of which are known under the name of nkisi nkondi. Figure 5 shows a human figure with nails. It is of modern manufacture but corresponds closely to the descriptions of the old statuettes. Tastevin also describes a statuette made with black wood "wrapped with a fawn-coloured beast skin" that was used to "heal". Besides these recognizable figures there are also artefacts such as "a fetish made of a red fabric with big black and white feathers coming out of it". The object was "redoubtable because of the feathers" and its role was to be "the protector of the village"; it recalls the "diabolic objects" mentioned three</page><page sequence="7">South African Archaeological Bulletin 64 (189): 51-60, 20095 57 FIG. 6. Nkisi mbwa yamba (from Van Wing, 1938) and figure 26 from the rock art site. centuries earlier by de Montesarchio. The animals, snakes, lizards, dogs, leopards, tortoises, among others, belong to this vast ensemble of artefacts linked to regional beliefs. Dogs, for instance, are mentioned in Van Wing's text, where he includes the photograph of mbwa yamba that I reproduce here (Fig. 6). We know its role: "to protect from the sorcerers, the robbers, and the enemies that cover one with wounds and tears one's entrails. It is also used as a special remedy for internal wounds and diseases" (Van Wing 1938). The statue of this animal recalls figure 26 from the site Pedra de Feitiço (Fig. 6). In addition to these important references about artistic objects linked to religion, up to the beginning of the twentieth century the regional artists maintained the tradition of engraving various figures on pot lids. Those figures had a precise meaning for the populations of Cabinda, north of the site of Pedra de Feitiço (Martins 1969). The study of these stone and wooden objects assists us in interpreting the regional significance of the rock art and its context, allowing us to extrapolate some of the meanings of the rock art or, at least, to consider some possibilities. A series of figures that we find in the rock art are also frequently used on the wooden pot lids of Cabinda (Fig. 7). The litter, for example, was regarded as a symbol of power and, when it was carried by only one person, or when a crippled person was beside a litter transporting a healthy person, it may be the representation of social injustice (Gutierrez 1996). Litters are also often represented at the rock art site, where we see representations of people carried on this symbol of power. It is therefore possible that the rock art is a regional representation of power and, insofar as the rock was regarded as a place connected with local religion, that it refers to the power of the divinities (Fig. 8: 20). Another example of similarity between Cabinda pot lids and the rock art is the cap worn by some figures. In the tradition of Cabinda, the cap on the head was the representation "of the knowledge that one has within". It is probable that the figures wearing a cap in the rock art are also representations of men of knowledge or experience in the area of Noki. In addition to the comparisons that can be done with Cabinda, an attentive observation of some motifs, such as the presentation of a triangular object to a saurian (Fig. 2: 7-24) suggests that some aquatic animals may be the objects of a particular kind of worship. Moreover, the crocodile is often invested with important symbolism: it is a symbol of power, including aquatic power, and wealth (Faïk-Nzuji 1993). And it is shown five times on the rock at Pedra do Feitiço. There are strong possibilities that, in this area, a crucial role was attributed to the crocodile and that the figures on the rock are a graphic manifestation of this role. Complex signs, such as the double lozenge, for example, are also shown on the rock. In other parts of Africa, this sign represents the concept 'union' (male-female) or the concept 'fecundity', and even 'complementarity' (Faïk-Nzuji 1993). BACK TO THE ROCK ART SITE OF PEDRA DO FEITIÇO After this short review of information concerning the art and religion of this part of northern Angola, we can return to the rock art at Pedra do Feitiço and attempt to understand it in the light of this information and the facts reported by Tuckey. As mentioned above, regional oral information, collected during Tuckey's expedition at the beginning of the nineteenth century, reported the existence of a religious man, gangan or priest, in the area of Noki, close to the site of Pedra do Feitiço. An explanation of each engraved figure and its role in the local religion is, alas, not provided by Tuckey, even though he must have known this as he indicated that the figures had the names of a 'fetish'. Concerning the priests, the gangan, of northern Angola, all seems to indicate that their role went beyond the execution of the rock art, because they were also responsible for the training of the youth in the creation and understanding of the objects that held the names of the regional divinities, rather than 'fetishes' as they are called in the literature of the time. Tuckey's informants also reported that the rock art was consid- ered to be the special residence of simbi, the protective spirit of the river (Tuckey 1818). Moreover, Tuckey mentions that figures similar to those seen in the rock art were also made on other materials, like calabashes and stones8. CONCLUSION The rock art figures visible in the recording of the 'Stone of the Fetish' allow us to identify people, animals, geometrical forms9, ships and other figures that are difficult to interpret. The information collected by Tuckey indicates that the figures all had the name of a 'fetish' and that they were made by a gangan of the area. Indeed, the historical documentation shows that the gangan was an important character in the societies of this part of the continent, and that their functions were very varied and related to the protection of an individual or the entire village. In the case of the villagers, I discussed the com- ments of de Montesarchio' s and Cavazzi's which showed that all were concerned and felt attacked when the cult objects were broken or burned by Europeans. The gangan also played an important role in relation to the environment since he could control rain and thunder, and remove misfortunes. In his various functions the gangan needed sacred objects called, according to some informants, nkisi. As the sources indicate, these nkisi existed in 1590 (Pigafetta 2002 [1591]) and survived as recently as 1930 (Van Wing 1938), despite their destruction by people such as de Montesarchio and Cavazzi. Although the role of the Zaire-Congo River has to be taken into account in the choice of the site, it is possible that this</page><page sequence="8">58 South African Archaeological Bulletin 64 (189): 51-60, 2009 L'injustice sociale Le savoir La confiance Le danger Symbole du roi Symbole du féticheur FIG. 7. Figures engraved on wood, with their meaning, Cabinda (from Martins 1969). choice was also a measure to protect the gangan and Noki from the destructive campaigns of Europeans commissioned to Christianize this part of Africa. As important as the choice of the site, the figures engraved on the rock clearly show the will to display people in action, be it in the transport of litters, in relationship with other people, or in front of animals. The choice of the people involved is not arbitrary: they have distinctive marks, caps, or hats that, as mentioned above, often signify special knowledge. Among group activities, the transport of the litters also seems very important because at least four figures depict this action (Fig. 2: 1, 2, 20, 32) and, at least in two cases, (Fig. 2: 2, 32) the trans- ported 'object' does not seem to be a noble' as Tuckey claimed, but rather a small anthropomorphic figure, maybe an 'idol' of the ancient literature, or to be more precise, a cult object. This idea of cult is also based on the presence of figure 24 (from the site recording) which, as mentioned above, seems to show two people presenting an offering to a saurian. Other animals have strong symbolic connotations, for example the big snake (Fig. 2: 21), which, since 1590, was one of the Congolese gods (Pigafetta 2002 [1591]) and continued to be used as a symbolic object of power until the 1960s, since it appears at this date as a symbol of the king on Cabinda pot lids. This is also probably true of one of the quadrupeds (Fig. 2: 26) which I compared with the mbwa yamba, or big dog, not so much because of a certainty in the identification of the rock figure as a dog, but because of the visual similarity with sculpted mbwa yamba. Yet, even knowing the subject matter and</page><page sequence="9">South African Archaeological Bulletin 64 (189): 51-60, 20095 59 FIG. 8. Example of a litter (20) and probable offerings (24). ritual context does not automatically reveal the full meaning of the figure. In other words, when field investigations uncover the symbolism of some animals, here the dog, we realize that the levels of knowledge are complex and that much remains unknown. Thus, in the case of the rock art the simple identifica- tion of the zoomorphic figures is not sufficient to allow access to the social significance of the animals. This observation also applies to the other figures shown. Concerning the animals, I mentioned the presence of saurians in the rock art but also in the literature, in particular, in the evocation of the lizard by Cadornega: the xillos. The stuffed animal appears as an nkisi protecting against the bite of wild animals. As well as the animals, other nkisi, for example magabu (Fig. 9), may also have a protective role. In the case of the latter, it is about the protection of individuals against the leopard- man. To all these pieces of evidence, the name of the site must be added: 'Stone of the Fetish7. As I showed above, from the very start of the European presence in the area, the African beliefs and divinities were tainted by the word 'fetish7 (which has hidden and still hides a complex reality). However, by doing this and by using this word to describe cult objects, the beliefs of the men and women who practised them, a great part of the culture of this part of Africa, escapes our knowledge. The same phenomenon of loss of knowledge might affect rock art, if we continue to use the word 'fetish', with its former meaning, within the name of a rock bearing art that is related to the values and beliefs of the societies who lived on the banks of the river. So, it seems to me that the rock with its art was a place where images related to the regional divinities were made. One FIG. 9. Nkisi magabu (from Van Wing 1938) of the important divinities was simbi, the protective spirit of the river. Other divinities or intermediaries between men and the gods seem also to be represented, either being transported in litters, or being the objects of offerings. Lastly, the site of Pedra do Feitiço offers the rare chance to comprehend rock art using local oral tradition and historical literature. This tradition refers to the religion of the time and to the sacred role of the site. Recent studies seem to confirm the ancient narratives concerning religious beliefs and practices. Our knowledge of the significance of this rock art site is not exhaustive, but a part of its message has been unveiled. NOTES λ'η an attempt to classify the rock art of Angola, J. Desmond Clark placed the paintings and engravings of this part of Africa within a Central African schematic art group (Clark 1966). This classification did not account for the meaning of the painted or engraved figures of Angola but tried to define an overall tradition of art. In my opinion, this grouping made interpretation more complex as it joined together very different sites within one tradition whereby the schematic - and there- fore succinct, without gradation, geometrical and simplified - charac- ter of the figures was chosen as the defining factor. The rock art of Angola, however, shows such diversity in its use of figures and in its style, that such a generalist classification seems to me poorly suited to the rock art of this area. 2I do not tackle this question here, as the literature on the subject is already abundant, both in English and French. 3Northern Angola has never been the object of systematic archaeologi- cal research. There are two articles dated from 1890 where vague infor- mation on the existence of some 'Neolithic' materials can be found (Gutierrez 2001b). Sporadic research took place in the 1970s in the town Mbanza-Kongo, but with no follow-up, and then in the 1980s the exca- vation of four tumuli in a royal cemetery in Soyo provided evidence of</page><page sequence="10">60 South African Archaeological Bulletin 64 (189): 51-60, 2009 funerary practices linked to cremation (Abranches 1991; Souindoula 1992). However, this research bears no relation to the rock art site that I study in this article. 4We shall see later that one of the nkisi magabu's functions is to protect people against leopard-men. This is probably an instrument to make rain, a fly-whisk made with a horse or an ox tail, as mentioned by Cadornega. 6I thank Julien Volper, doctor in the history of African arts (University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne), who gave me permission to use his photo- graphs for this publication. 7Although the objects seem to retrace a part of the history of the Hoyos, in the 1930s the Europeans persist in speaking of 'fetishes' and confiscating them. Concordant information on African priests and the representation of idols on various materials is provided one century later by E. Callewaert (1905). 9In a book dedicated to Zambian rock art, Benjamin Smith tackles the study of painted rock art sites in the Kasama District, where a long tra- dition of painting geometrical figures is found (Smith 1997). The figures are painted either in red or in red and white, and the most common forms are: circles, parallel lines, filled circles, radiating circles, etc. The author proposes very interesting interpretations linked to weather divination and/or fertility. However, the figures of the Kasama District sites are different from the geometric figures of Pedra do Feitiço, in northern Angola, and if a link with the rock art of Angola is to be found it is most likely in the comparable geometric rock art sites in the south- ern part of the country (for instance Tchitundo-hulo).
