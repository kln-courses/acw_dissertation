<plain_text><page sequence="1">Teaching the Religiously Indifferent WILLIAM F. QUILLIAN, JR.* T HE teacher of religion faces a para- doxical situation today. On the one hand, he encounters in his students indifference and even professions of hostility toward religion; but, on the other hand, he finds all about him a concern for spiritual values. This concern is seen in the often in- articulate but real belief of many who fought the recent war that they were seeking to pre- serve values of justice, freedom, decency, and honesty. The critic of religion often testifies to his own concern for spiritual values when he inveighs against the seeming disregard for truth on the part of religion. From many quarters one finds the emerging insistence that the only hope for mankind is in an emphasis upon spiritual values. Toynbee's A Study of History gives a scholarly elaboration and de- fense of this idea. The concern of the teacher and counsellor of students is with the first side of this paradox, namely, the apparent indifference or hostility to religion. To prescribe a remedy without first diagnosing a condition is foolhardy. Therefore, our first task is to ask the dual question: Where is the cause of this religious indifference located, and what is the factor or what are the factors re- sponsible for it? Does the ultimate responsibility for the re- ligious indifference of college students rest upon the college, the home, the church, the com- munity, or upon a combination of these? One diagnosis which anyone connected in a re- sponsible way with the religious life of an in- stitution of higher learning is certain to have had thrust at him--sometimes as a pill whose coating of sugar is pretty thin--is that college destroys the religious faith of students. The temptation to condemn such a diagnosis as scapegoating by ministers and parents who have failed in their efforts is resisted only be- cause of the recognition that such a counter charge might be merely an attempt of the college educator himself to find a scapegoat. Instead, I shall venture an alternative explana- tion which changes the nature of this familiar criticism of higher education and in doing this may blunt slightly the point of the critic's spear. But the proffered explanation does not constitute a defense of the educator; in fact, it involves a criticism which calls attention to a situation that is perhaps still more difficult for him to meet by corrective measures. Close association with students leads to the conviction that very few who enter college with any kind of significant religious experience or convictions lose their religion because of the kind of instruction received, or because of the lack of it, or because of the influences that play upon them during their college career. The student who seems to have lost or seems about to lose a genuine religious commitment is usually the easiest one to help to find a firm foundation for his religion. The student who poses a really tough problem for the religious instructor or counsellor is the one who comes to college without a vital religious commit- ment; and the great majority of students are in this group, for in many instances where religion is professed it is largely a meaningless profession. What does this mean? Can the colleges lay the burden of responsibility upon the doorstep of the parents and the home church and the community from which their students come? This is a temptingly easy attitude to assume. But to seek such an easy "out" would mean that the colleges were thereby admitting that they have a negligible influence upon the so- ciety in the midst of which they exist, and this they will not do. These institutions are built upon a faith that it is possible to effect changes * Professor of Philosophy in Ohio Wesleyan Uni- versity.

Thus, we are brought to an answer to the earlier question: Can a college escape responsi- bility for the lack of religious interest and com- mitment on the part of its graduates by plac- ing the blame upon the home and community? The answer must be in the negative, because the failure of home and church and community may be attributed, at least in part, to the failure of the colleges. Contrary to the frequently voiced charge, courses in biology or psychology or in other fields have seldom done much harm to a stu- dent who enters college with a well-founded religious faith. Such extensions of a student's intellectual horizons will undoubtedly necessi- tate some re-thinking and reformulation of that person's religious convictions, but this should cause no greater disturbance than that which comes to a child when he learns that the cereal and bread which he eats were first of all tiny grains on tall stems in a field. The sin committed by the colleges is not so much one of commission by certain of the disciplines taught; it is, rather, the ineffectiveness of much religious instruction in the past. It is, indeed, a vicious circle. Students come to college with religious training that is inade- quate, and they return to their home com- munities little different-neither better off nor worse off so far as their religious life is con- cerned; and the process begins again as they become parents, teachers, and ministers. II Can this vicious circle be broken? For an answer, we turn to the second step in our diag- nosis, asking what factor or factors are responsi- ble for this religious indifference. Our analysis so far has tried to discover the locus of the cause; now we shall try to describe the nature of the cause. At least part of the explanation is found in the religious indifference which permeates so- ciety. It would be expecting almost too much of young people to think that they would grow up religiously literate and committed when their parents and their neighbors seem to have so little concern for things religious. And yet indifference on the part of parents and of society is only a secondary cause. There remains the deeper problem of accounting for this indifference in the student's social en- vironment and at the same time in the student himself. Pressing our inquiry this step further, we come to an explanation which should serve as a guide in teaching and counselling the stu- dent who professes indifference about religion. The heart of the problem is ignorance about the nature of religion, and the complementary fact that this gap is filled by false and inade- quate ideas about religion. No area of society is exempt from this criticism, not even the churches nor the professional religious leader. Of course, there are persons and institutions which are conspicuously different in this re- spect, but they are too few. III These false or inadequate conceptions are mainly of two kinds. The first are ideas about the nature of religion. The average person tends to identify religion with its external forms and its institutional expressions. Religion, for him, means the doing of certain things, and it never occurs to him that there may be nothing at all religious in such performances if they are not related to and expressions of some deep, per- sonal experience. It is the reciting of a creed or the utterance of a prayer, and, for him, these are simply so many words. It is attend- ance upon services of worship, and such at- tendance is, for him, simply a habit established in youth or a pleasant social experience which can be missed with even less sense of loss than would come from missing a session of a bridge club or of a civic luncheon club. If this be what religion means to a person, can anyone blame him for being indifferent? Or he may think of religion as being some esoteric ex- perience which some people claim to have had but which he knows he has never had and never will have so long as he remains in his right mind; he scorns the credulity of those who are so "deluded" as to think that a "psy-</page><page sequence="3">112 WILLIAM F. QUILLIAN, JR. chologically explainable" experience is an ex- perience of God. The second set of false or inadequate concep- tions which foster religious indifference is in the realm of religious metaphysics-ideas of God, of heaven, and of hell especially. Probably the most widely held idea of God is one which is crudely anthropomorphic. Hell and heaven are thought of as places with definite geographical locations and with physical characteristics arranged to give painful or pleasurable sensations respec- tively. Now such ideas, however incorrect, may be held by a person with a limited knowledge of the physical world without constituting a barrier to his religious faith. Indeed, the beliefs held by many of the world's greatest religious geniuses have had just such metaphysical frameworks. This has been possible because for them religion was far more than a metaphysical framework. But when a person thinks that the essence of religion is affirming certain beliefs about God and immortality, and then finds that his understanding of these beliefs con- flicts with his understanding of the physical universe, the outcome is well nigh inevitable. The religious beliefs are discarded. But science is not responsible for this; rather it is those persons and institutions which failed in his religious training. And the pity of it all is that often persons whose own ideas are quite differ- ent will, through laziness, fall into the use of the traditional terminology of religion without making clear just what these terms mean to them. The result is that inadequate and false images are stimulated in the mind that is still highly impressionable. Indifference about religion, then, seems due in large measure to the incorrect meanings usually suggested by terms such as religion, religious experience, God, etc. IV But now we turn back to that question which states the main issue of this discussion: Can the colleges do anything to dispel this indifference? Or, phrased differently, can religion be taught? The answer to this question depends largely upon one's definition of terms, and the reader is probably thinking it is high time that some explanation be given of what is meant by the term "religion" as used in this discussion. As implied in the references already made to this term, "religion" is thought of as having as its referrent an experience of an individual or of individuals. The religious experience is perhaps most adequately characterized as a response of one's whole being-thinking, feel- ing and acting-to that which he deems worthy of his highest loyalty and devotion. Central in such a definition is the idea of commitment. This emphasis appears in Reinhold Niebuhr's Hazen pamphlet on "The Contribution of Re- ligion to Cultural Unity." He explains that "The religious problem... is not a problem which can be solved in purely academic terms. It always contains a moral imperative. Men must seek to realize what they truly are; and they must seek to fulfill what they conceive to be the true meaning of their common existence. There is therefore a necessity of spiritual and moral commitment in every religious appre- hension of the meaning of life." Furthermore, an answer to the question, "Can religion be taught?" will depend upon what we mean by "teaching." If we mean im- parting factual information, then our answer must be in the negative, for, as the definition of religion just suggested indicates and as we have implied throughout this discussion, re- ligion is not primarily a matter of factual in- formation. It is possible to understand all the evidences for the existence of God, and yet not have one's life oriented to God. One may know all about the writing and compilation of the books of the Bible, but may never have shared the aspirations and convictions of the early leaders of the Hebrew and Christian religions. One of the greatest perils that confronts the student and the teacher is the peril of the academic mind, the tendency to treat subject matter content as an end in itself. But teaching, whether in the field of religion, science, history, mathematics, or any other field, may be thought of in a different sense. It may mean the attempt to efect significant changes in the thinking and the life orientation of the stu-</page><page sequence="4">TEACHING THE RELIGIOUSLY INDIFFERENT 113 dent. When teaching is understood in this sense, religion can be taught. How is this to be done? V The admonition, "begin with the student where he is," is familiar and sound pedagogical advice. Applied to the problem under discus- sion, this means that the first step in effectively teaching religion is helping the student to understand and to interpret rightly those re- ligiously significant experiences which are part of the fabric of his own life. This suggestion is based upon the conviction that God is always with us and constantly reveals Himself to us. From this conviction, it follows that those who claim to have no personal experience of Him simply have false ideas about what and where God is and how He manifest Himself to men. This view has been expressed by theologians of various schools of thought. For example, in Our Knowledge of God, John Baillie states that "the believer (often) finds God in experiences which the unbeliever would equally claim to have had, but which seem to him susceptible of a purely humanistic or naturalistic inter- pretation" (p. 53). H. N. Wieman expresses a similar thought in his Religious Experience and Scientific Method when he says, "to worship means to become wholly attentive to God, i.e. to subject oneself to that total mass of stimu- lation which is playing upon one all the time but to which one is not responsive save in worship" (p. 248). What are these experiences which are present to all persons but whose religious significance is not always recognized? Two of the most im- pressive are suggested in Kant's oft-quoted statement: "Two things fill me with awe, the starry heavens above and the moral law within." The latter of these is a most profitable starting point in trying to bring students to a conscious recognition of their own experience of God, for even the most skeptical will usually admit that there is some moral obligation or duty or some supreme good which he recog- nizes. The teacher or counsellor's next task, then, is to help the student to see that such an experience remains an enigma apart from a religious explanation of it. Let the student see that when men have spoken of their experience of God, they have often meant precisely the kind of experience which is familiar to him. In this way he may come to see with Von Hilgel that "everyone who believes fully in anything at all, be it the obligation to truth- fulness, in the more than utilitarian worth of his wife's or daughter's chastity, even in the more than empirical worth of natural science, believes that these things are part of a moral order and believes in the more than human character of this moral order."' One aspect of this initial step may be that of challenging the student to examine the ade- quacy of his own commitments. He should be led to ask himself if that or those things to which he gives his highest allegiance and de- votion qualify for such a high position. Thus, he may be led to distinguish between and to make a choice between true and false gods. Recent history should help him to see the dis- aster which befalls a people when they worship an inadequate god, such as a state or a race; such an illustration may help to give him per- spective in judging the adequacy of his own gods. As is evident, the starting point in this ap- proach to the teaching of religion is philosoph- ical. This seems to me necessary, for I cannot see how a person who is religiously indifferent because of the inadequate referrents which the usual vocabulary of religion have in his think- ing can be changed in his attitude toward re- ligion by being introduced to literature which uses this vocabulary. This does not mean that a course in the philosophy of religion must pre- cede a course in Bible. It does mean, however, that little religion, defined as a personal ex- perience, will be taught by a study of the Bible or of other religious literature unless the stu- dent has some understanding of the extent to which his own experiences are properly classi- fiable as religious. However, this philosophical approach to the teaching of religion can be only the starting point. There must next come the enriching of the student's religious experiences, and this will</page><page sequence="5">114 WILLIAM F. QUILLIAN, JR. be accomplished as he is brought into touch with others who have testified to their own re- ligious experience and commitment. Here the study of the Bible and of other great religious writings can help. In this connection I agree with Paul Ramsey when he states that "what is needed for the communication of the Chris- tian faith.., .is a literature which is nonmys- tical, nonpietistic, and nonmoralistic but which, at the same time, understands Christian truth as 'concerned knowledge'."2 Through acquaint- ance with such a body of literature, the stu- dent who has come to see that religion is a very real element in his life will find light thrown upon his own experiences. Increasingly wider areas of his experience may be given a re- ligious interpretation as he learns of the deeper meanings that others have found in similar experiences. To recapitulate, if religious indifference is to be overcome, the student must first have his false ideas of religion and of religious beliefs corrected. Then he must be led to see that cer- tain of his own experiences are at heart re- ligious experiences. And finally, these initial manifestations of conscious religious awareness should be nurtured and increased in depth and extent by introducing the student to the testi- mony given by others of their confrontations by God and of their responses. Much more could be said about the teaching of religion. It might be pointed out that the philosophical study of religion can help to re- move some of the hindrances to religious faith by showing that religious faith is intellectually respectable. Or it might be emphasized that religion cannot be taught effectively as long as the persons and institutions outwardly pro- fessing religion do not harmonize their be- haviour with their professions. As George A. Coe said several years ago in discussing "What Makes a College Christian,"3 it is not enough to ask about chapel, Bible classes, etc.; "It is at least as important to ask what wages the scrubwomen receive and how they are treated." In conclusion, let us return to the seeming paradox with which we began: the co-existence of religious indifference and the widespread concern for spiritual values. This discussion may have achieved two things: First, the recog- nition that the first part of this contradiction, namely, the indifference of students as well as of others, is due to an abysmal ignorance about religion; and second, the recognition that the widespread concern for spiritual values may become the point at which the vicious circle of religious indifference can begin to be broken. The teacher of religion faces no greater chal- lenge than that of religious indifference on the part of so many of his students, but the success- ful meeting of that challenge in even a single instance is one of the most rewarding expe- riences that can come to him.
