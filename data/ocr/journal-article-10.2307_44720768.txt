Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT The location of the pelvis in the seated automobile operator is critical for proper packaging and seat comfort design. The pelvis is the skeletal structure which contains the hip joint (H-point) and ischial tuberosity (D-point). The orientation of the pelvis largely determines the curvature in the low back which is supported by lumbar supports in the seat back. A methodology has been developed that uses on- board video and pressure measurement systems to locate the pelvis. This system has been used in a mid-sized vehicle on seated operators driving the vehicle on the highway. This paper describes the methodology and the location of the pelvis in seated automobile operators. INTRODUCTION The location of the pelvis in the seated automobile driver significantly affects the occupant's comfort, vehicle operation and safety. Specifically, three points on the pelvis are of great importance: H-point (hip joint location) D-point (ischial tuberosity) and ASIS (anterior superior iliac spine). H-point is important for vehicle packaging. D-point is important for comfort and safety of the occupant. ASIS interacts with the lap belt in restraining the occupant during a crash. In addition to the obvious significance of these three landmarks, the location of the pelvis, in general, largely defines the posture of the seated occupant. Seated posture is determined primarily by torso geometry. That is, the relationship between the chest and pelvis control the shape of the low back which is the primary determinant of slouched or erect seated posture. As a result, we can quantitatively describe posture when the position of the pelvis and chest are accurately measured. The pelvis is one of the most difficult body segments to measure in living subjects due to the amount of tissue overlaying it and privacy concerns when measuring that area of the body. This paper describes methods developed at the Ergonomics Research Laboratory for measuring pelvic position in the laboratory on a hard seat as well as in a seat buck or vehicle laboratory. This method uses non-invasive methods for locating H-point and D-point. Results from 102 subjects are summarized, describing five points measured on each subject's pelvis and one additional point (H-point) calculated from the measured data. Thus, a method for locating the pelvis in the seated automobile driver is demonstrated. METHODS LOCATING H-POINT FROM ANATOMICAL LANDMARKS. To locate the hip joint (H-point) of the human pelvis, we assume that the 3D location of the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) points and ischial tuberosity points are known. Figure 1 shows the left ASIS point (A), the right ASIS point (B), and the left ischial tuberosity (point I). Our goal is to determine the 3D coordinates of the H-point (H) based on the location of the ASIS points and ischial tuberosity points. Figure 1. The human pelvis and the landmarks used to estimate H-point. 498</page><page sequence="2">In the linear regression analysis, we established the relationship between ||A-I|| and ||A-P|| where || || is the Euclidean distance and P is the projection of H to the line AI. There is a strong relationship between ||A-I|| and ||A-P||. These results provide a method for calculating the 3D coordinates of the point P based on the ASIS and ischial tuberosity (I) points. Male and female pelves differ significantly in their shape below the pelvic inlet [2, 3]. As a result, we divided the pelves of the Reynolds, et al data base [1] into two groups based on gender and, for each group, a linear regression equation is derived between ||A-I|| and ||A-P|| for each group. Using the common notation for regression analysis [4], we let X = ||A-I|| and y = ||A-P||. Thus, l|A-P|| = ß II A-I|| + a (1) where A is the anterior superior iliac spine point, I is the ischial tuberosity point and P is the projection of the hip joint point to the line AI. The pelvis database [1] has 80 male and 85 female pelves, of which we used 73 male and 79 female pelves. The scatter diagram and linear fit results are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Scatter plots and regression lines of the projection length ||A-P|| against the length of the vector ||A-I|| (Female = top graph, Male = lower graph). The regression equations are y = 0.67 X -2 1 .25 (males) (2) y = 0.68 X -17.50 (females) (3) An analysis of variance was performed for each of the regression lines and the probabilities of the F value in the male and female regressions were significant at the 0.0001 levels. The r2 values for these linear relationships in the male and female pelves are 0.82 and 0.85, respectively. The regression equations relate the point P to the right anterior superior iliac spine point (Ar) and the ischial tuberosity point (I). The 3D coordinates of P can be computed using equations (2) or (3), depending on gender. Given the 3D coordinates of the left and right ischial tuberosity points (IL and IR), and the right anterior superior iliac spine point (Ar), as shown in Figure 3, we assume that the hip joint point H is coplanar with the points IL , IR and AR and the angle a (angle between ARIR and ARH) is known. The angle a can be determined from the pelvic data base and the mean and standard deviations for males and females are summarized in Table 1. Ar / °7 : H / I ! IL Ir D C Figure 3. Illustration of the relevant points for computing hip joint point (H). The procedure for computing the hip joint point is as follows: 1. Compute the 3D coordinates of the point P using equations (2) or (3), depending on the gender of the subject. 2. Let C be the intersection point of line segments ILIR and HP and D be the projection of the point AR on the line ILIR.

Finally, the 3D coordinate of the hip joint point H is computed. According to the definition of the point P, we have HP perpendicular to ARP. Therefore, 499</page><page sequence="3">I Ar - Hl = I Ar - P|| / cosa (6) Then the 3D coordinate of H can be computed from H = C + (l + ''H - P|| / ||P - C||)(P - C) (7) The above equations assume that the hip joint point H is coplanar with the points IL , IR and AR. This assumption is based on an analysis of the pelvis database. If the point P lies on the plane determined by the points IL , IR and AR, and the angle between the line ARH and the plane is 0, then the angle 0 can be determined from the pelvic data base [1]. Table 2 shows the mean and the standard deviation of 0 and a. Since the angle 0 is small, the assumption that H-point lies on the plane defined by IL , IR and AR can be assumed to be valid.

In our experiments with human subjects, the ischial tuberosity points were detected based on locating the peak pressure from pressure mats. However, since the ischial tuberosity is a curved surface approximately 7-8 cm in length, we do not know exactly to which point on the ischial tuberosity the peak pressure corresponds. Since locating the ischial tuberosity is a key component of our technique for calculating H-point, we investigated the effect of using different points on the ischial tuberosity and the corresponding error in locating H-point. Points #399 and #408 of the Reynolds, et al [1] data base were used (Figure 4). Point #408 is the most posterior point on the ischial tuberosity, and it lies midway along the curved surface of the ischial tuberosity. Point #399 is the most anterior point of the ischial tuberosity in the data base. We also used a point mid-way between points #399 and #408. These points provide a means of determining the accuracy of the method as well as the robustness of the approach in the cases where the inputs are not the exact points used in developing the regression equations. The error was estimated using the Euclidean distance between the calculated hip joint point and the true 3D coordinates of the hip joint point from the database. The results are summarized in Table 2. EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURES. Measuring anatomical landmarks on the pelvis of a driver operating a moving vehicle on the highway is a difficult task. In order to determine pelvic position in 3D space, at least three points on the pelvis must be measured. These three points are measured under difficult conditions but with sufficient accuracy to resolve points that can be used to define a local frame of reference. The most easily identifiable and accessible point is the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). This point is identifiable using a video based system for measuring landmarks of the seated vehicle operator [5]. The ischial tuberosities can be measured in the seated posture using a pressure mat system. The ischial tuberosities are pelvic structures through which body weight is transmitted in the seat posture, and therefore, these structures define peak pressures in the seat cushion. Figure 4.

Average and standard deviation of the mean error for locating H-point. We obtain multiple measurements of these three points on each driver in different environments. We measured each driver in the laboratory on a hard Spine Anthropometry Seat (SAS chair), in a seat buck, and in the vehicle laboratory [5]. The measurements of the pelvis in the laboratory SAS chair are the most accurate, and the seat buck and vehicle laboratory are the least accurate. In all measurement environments, however, equivalent landmarks are measured. Pressure mats are used to locate the peak pressures under the ischial tuberosities and the anterior superior iliac spine is measured either with a 3d electro-goniometer or video anthropometry [5]. 500</page><page sequence="4">Pressure Mąt System, Placing a pressure mat between a subject and a seat surface provides a means of locating and measuring the high pressure areas under the ischial tuberosities. Pressure mats were used to locate the contact area and measure the centroid of the high-pressure peaks under the ischial tuberosities of a seated subject. Two 112mm X 112mm mats (with 1.2mm X 1.2mm sensors on 2.5mm centers, lOpsi max pressure) were used on the SAS chair. In the vehicle laboratory, a pressure mat 381mm x 457mm with 5mm x 5mm square sensors on 10mm centers was used. 3D Electro-goniometer System. A six degree of freedom electro-goniometer capable of measuring the three- dimensional position of a point with an error less than 0.5mm was used to measure the location of the anatomical landmarks of subjects sitting in the SAS chair. Video Anthropometry. The video anthropometry system [5] is composed of four video cameras mounted in the seat buck and vehicle laboratory in standardized locations. The video cameras provide a means of measuring the three- dimensional position of any point that lies in the field of view of at least two cameras. Using this method, targets on a subject can be measured in a safe and noninvasive manner during actual highway driving. Images from the four cameras are multiplexed by a frame grabber board in an IBM compatible 486 computer. All camera images are collected in 0.28 seconds. A generalized stereo algorithm was utilized to develop the software for image analysis. When two or more cameras observe the same target, the three-dimensional coordinates can be calculated using direct linear transformation. Coordinate Systems. For the SAS, the origin was 145 mm behind the seat back and lay approximately in the mid-sagittal plane. The +Z axis was directed upward, perpendicular to the horizontal seat surface of the SAS. +X was defined in a forward direction and +Y was defined in the left lateral direction. Thus, a right-handed, orthogonal axis system was defined that corresponded tè the axes of the cardinal anatomical planes of the body (y.e. sagittal, frontal, and transverse). For the vehicle laboratory and seatbuck, the coordinate system origin was located at the right rear seat- track bolt, with +X parallel to the right seat-track, +Y pointing toward the left seat-track and +Z running perpendicular to the plane defined by the left and right seat-tracks. PELVIC MEASUREMENT PROCEDURES. One hundred and two subjects were measured with ages ranging from 25 to 76. From these subjects, forty were selected to drive a mid-size vehicle on three highway trips for a total of approximately fours driving. There were equal number of males and females distributed equally among five 10-year age groups with statures equally distributed above and below the average stature for the US population. After a subject arrived, the purpose and procedures of the experiment were explained and the subject signed an informed consent form approved by the MSU UCRIHS committee. All subjects wore biking shorts and a tank top. Shoes were removed for the SAS chair measurements. In the laboratory, the subject was asked to sit on the SAS chair so that there were two clearly defined peak pressures on the pressure mats. The output of the pressure mats was shown in real time on a computer monitor and subject position was adjusted until the high pressure areas created by the ischial tuberosities were visible. For some subjects the pressure readings were saturated beyond the range of the pressure mat, so a foam pad was placed over the pressure mats to reduce any potential for damage to the mats. Once the subject was positioned so that reliable pressure data were measured for their seated position, a seat belt was used to hold the pelvis in place. The seat belt was tightened and a wooden plate was pressed against the back of their pelvis to insure the pelvis was held fixed. The subject's feet were placed so that the tibia was perpendicular to the floor. Seat height was then adjusted so that the knee angle was at 105°. A shoulder support was placed in front of the subject's shoulders while the subject maintained a neutral upright posture. Subjects sat in five postures: 1 Erect, 1 Neutral and 3 Slumped. These postures represent the full range of positions for a subject in a driving posture. The three-dimensional coordinates were measured for points on the thigh, pelvis, chest and spine for each of the five postures. Five points were measured on each subject's pelvis and the greater trochanter of the femur was measured to provide additional information for our error analysis of H-point. One additional point (H- point) was calculated from the measured data. The positions of three pressure cells on the pressure mats were measured using the 3D electro-gonoiometer; thus the location of each pressure cell was mapped back to the SAS axis system. We assumed that the mat lies on the xy-plane, so the z value was the same for every point on the mat. A pressure mapping of a subject seated in the SAS is illustrated in Figure 5. The black crosses illustrate the location of the pressure peak. In these illustrations the dark areas indicate low pressure and bright areas indicate high pressure. Figure 5. Pressure maps of a subject seated in the Extended Posture. We assume that the ischial tuberosities are located in the peak pressure areas. However, inspection of the pressure images reveals that data from subjects seated on these mats have a high pressure plateau instead of a single point that could be defined as the peak. We therefore define the peak as the centroid of the largest closed region of high pressure values. Also in the laboratory, subjects were measured in a seat buck. We installed a video anthropometry system in the seat buck as in the vehicle laboratory [5] and also placed a pressure mat between the upholstery and foam. Each subject 501</page><page sequence="5">sat in the seat buck and we measured the position of the pelvis with video anthropometry and pressure as previously described. For those subjects who drove the vehicle laboratory, we took the same measurements while they were operating the vehicle on the highway. There were a minimum of fourteen measurements of pelvic landmarks used in the algorithm to calculate the position and orientation of the pelvis for each subject. PELVIS POSITION FROM MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS. We assumed that the pelvis is a rigid skeletal structure in the body and consequently any three non- collinear points on this structure can define its position. We used the right anterior superior iliac spine (RASIS) and the right (RISCH) and left (LISCH) ischial tuberosities. There are a minimum of fourteen measurement sets that describe the position of each subject's pelvis in the SAS chair, seat buck and vehicle laboratory. This set of data on each subject, therefore, defines a sample of sequential measurements of the rigid pelvic structure. An algorithm has been developed that minimizes variance in the estimation of the 3D coordinates of the three targets used to define the position of the pelvis in sequential measurements. We followed algorithms from computer vision in which tracking an object in space and time uses sequences of images in time. Filters have been developed that assist this process and we have adapted an extended Kaiman filter [6] for this purpose. In general, we have m sets of sequential measurements of a pelvis and for each measurement set z we obtain the three-dimensional coordinates of the three points, RASIS, RISCH and LISCH. The 3D coordinates are denoted in a local coordinate system 0¡ as x/7, x/2, and x;3 respectively. The transformation between different local coordinate system z and j can be expressed using the following formula: = R,jx,,k + T,j (g) Our goal is to improve the estimation of pelvis position based on the Xjj where z = 1 ,...,/w and j = 1,...,3. For the vehicle operator, we assume that the sequential measurements describe motion of the pelvis in the sagittal plane. That is, the pelvis slides over the seat surface plane and rotates about an axis passing through the RISCH and LISCH landmarks. The unkown quantities to minimize, thus, are the 2D coordinates of the local axis system origin, the translation velocity of this origin, the angle of a 2D position vector describing the orientation of the pelvis, and the angular velocity of this vector in the plane of motion. The state of these parameters is then completely characterized at time t by the following vector: x(0 = K(0^m(0,L,(0,&gt;'m(0,ct(0,ß(0,ä(0i(0]' If we assume that the evolution of the change of position and orientation of the pelvis is stable over time, then a recursive solution is possible [7,8]. Simulation of this method results in linear errors of approximately 4.0mm after 10 iterations and in angular errors of approximately 5-9° in the position and orientation of the pelvis. RESULTS RELIABILITY OF SAS PELVIC MEASUREMENTS. Five postures were measured for each subject, providing a means of comparing the relative positions of each pelvic landmark. Since the exact location of the landmarks are not known, the error will be estimated from the standard deviation of the change in length of the vector between the various landmarks. The most easily palpated landmark is the ASIS, thus the errors involving that vector are expected to be lower than vectors not containing that vector. The most difficult points to locate are the PSIS and SI, primarily due to the tissue overlying these points. Thus, it is expected that the measurement errors can be described by investigating the standard deviation of the relative length changes of the vector between SI and PSIS and the vector between PSIS and ASIS. We measured the location of the ischial tuberosities with pressure mats. However, the error in locating these points using this system is not known, thus we will estimate the error by investigating the standard deviation of the change in length of the vector between the two ischial tuberosities. Given a set of repeated 3-D measurements of two points in space, P, Q where P and Q are on a rigid body that is moving in space, one means of examining measurement errors is to determine the change in length of the vector r (where r = P-Q) If we denote r = ||r||, then for n measurements of P, Q, the standard deviation of r¡ (where i = l..n) is an estimate of the error. If there are several subjects, each having the points P, Q measured, then what is the overall error in measuring the points P, Q for all subjects? Let r¡ j be the jh measurement of subject z. The change of the measurement rfj with respect to the mean of the subject i is: su=nJ-rl (8) 1 tH&gt; where r- - *S'rĒ ¡ and mi is the number of measurements for subject z'. Due to different body sizes, the measurement r varies between individuals. s¡j is a relative measure so that it can remove this effect. The standard deviation of s¡ ¡ over all measurements indicates the measurement error (Table 3). The standard deviation of the s¡ values over n measurements is the same as that for r¡ , but the values for s¡ are independent of the subject and simply indicates measurement error (Table 3), since the effect of vector length has been removed. 502</page><page sequence="6">We will examine the standard deviation of the change in length of the following vectors (Figure 6): s, = change in length of the vector from SI to PSIS (i*!) relative to the average length of that vector over five measurements for each subject. s2 = change in length of the vector from PSIS to ASIS (r2) relative to the average length of that vector over five measurements for each subject. s3 = change in length of the vector from the left ischial tuberosity to ASIS (r3) relative to the average length of that vector over five measurements for each subject. s4 = change in length of the vector from the right ischial tuberosity to ASIS (r4) relative to the average length of that vector over five measurements for each subject. s5 = change in length of the vector from the left to the right ischial tuberosity (r5) relative to the average length of that vector over five measurements for each subject. s0 = change in the angle between the PSIS-ASIS- ischial tuberosity relative to the average angle between those points over five measurements for each subject (note: the angle is the projected angle between those points on the XZ plane (sagittal plane) as defined in the coordinate system for the SAS).

The analysis only includes the results from 34 subjects. Due to a change in protocol and technical difficulties a complete set of five pelvic measurements was only obtained on 34 subjects. Subject pelvic dimensions were compared to their equivalents in the database [1]. Specifically, the PSIS- ASIS distance, the left-right ischial tuberosity distance and the left- right ASIS distances are compared (Table 4). The dimensions were calculated as the Euclidean distance between landmarks. #399 [1] represented the ischial tuberosity (Figure 4). Since foam was placed over the mats, the distance from the ischial tuberosity to the ASIS was calculated after adjusting for foam thickness. Foam thickness was measured using a skinfold caliper to apply a known pressure while simultaneously measuring thickness. The calipers apply 10 gms/mm2 and are accurate to 0. 1mm. The foam thickness was calculated after the caliper pressure was applied for at least 1 min., to minimize the effect of creep in the foam thickness measurement. The pressure applied by the calipers is similar to the pressure under the ischial tuberosities and thus the foam thickness measured with this technique will be close to that of the foam as it was compressed by the subject.

DISCUSSION The position and orientation of pelvis in the seated automobile driver determines torso posture. Two important studies of the location of the pelvis [9,10] have been made in the last thirty-five years. However, in neither of these studies were the subjects measured in the motor vehicle while operating the vehicle on the highway. Three design and test tools have been developed which utilize Geoffrey's data [9]. These tools are H-Point Template (i.e. OSCAR), H-Point Machine and the adult crash test dummies. All of these tools define the location of H-Point (i.e. hip joint in the seated occupant) for packaging, seat design test and evaluation, and crash worthiness. As a result, the position and orientation of the pelvis has been highly integrated into the design and testing of the seated motor vehicle environment. The ability to measure the location and orientation of the pelvis in the seated operator while driving a motor vehicle is important for seat design, packaging and the design and position of a crash test dummy in the motor vehicle seat. Our research has developed a methodology that uses non-invasive measurements to calculate the position of the seated automobile driver. The data that define the location of the pelvis are based upon multiple measurements from the laboratory and in the motor vehicle. The redundant, sequential measurement system, however, is limited by the resolution of the instrumentation and measurement errors. In the SAS laboratory measurements, the error estimates for measuring anatomical landmarks on the human pelvis (Table 2) show that the largest errors occur between SI and PSIS. These landmarks are difficult to identify on most subjects due to the large amount of tissue overlying these points. The standard deviations between the ischial tuberosities and the right ASIS are the smallest, indicating that these measurements are the most reliable. To clarify the magnitude of these differences, the pressure mats used to locate the ischial tuberosities have a distance of 2.5mm between sensor cells. This inter-sensor distance is slightly smaller than the error estimate of 3.63 mm, the standard deviation in vector length between the two ischial tuberosities (s5 in Table 3). Thus, we conclude that the pressure mat is as reliable as human palpation for locating a bony anatomical landmark such as Point #408 to be used in the calculated location of H-point. In Table 3 the pelvic dimensions for the 102 subjects in the current study are compared to the dimensions from the pelvic data base [1]. The PSIS- ASIS length is larger for the current study than the equivalent length in the database. This difference is expected because there is considerable tissue overlying ASIS and PSIS, which adds to the vector length compared to a similar measurement taken over dry bone. In the Reynolds et al data base there are two points that were measured on the ischial tuberosity that correspond to the ischial tuberosity measurements in this study, and these points are #399 and #408 in Figure 6. The more anterior point, #399, in Reynolds et al [1] has a mean distance from its contralateral point of 79.5mm (males) and 97.5mm (females). Using #408 in the same study, the inter-ischial tuberosity distance is 120.3mm (males) and 135.5mm (females). The inter-ischial tuberosity distance measured in this study lies between these two. Thus the point being measured on the subjects' pelves lies between the anterior of the ischial tuberosity, #399, and the posterior point of the ischial tuberosity, #408. The average difference in the distance between the ischial tuberosity and the ASIS is 32.1mm for males and 25.9mm for females between the current study and the pelvic data base (Table 3). Tissue thickness under the ischial tuberosities accounts for 10- 15mm of the differences and palpation error on living subjects accounts for the remainder. For the PSIS-ASIS vector length the errors are on the order of 12- 13mm, an acceptable error range considering tissue deposits and palpation errors. An analysis of the ischial tuberosity motion over the five postures measured on the SAS chair reveals that the ischial tuberosity slid rearward and the pelvis rolled forward as the subjects slumped forward and rested their chest on the chest support. It is not likely that the centroid of the pressure mat corresponded to the same point on the ischial tuberosity for all five measurements. This apparent motion raises the question of the effect an erroneous point on the ischial tuberosity has on the estimated location of H-point. An analysis of the pelvic data base reveals that the regression model is fairly robust and that the error in calculating H-point is minimal (Table 4). The H-point calculation method was tested using the data from the pelvic database [1]. We conducted three tests to determine the ability of the regression equations to accurately predict H-point. In the first test, the 3D coordinates of the right ASIS point and the posterior point of the left and right ischial tuberosity were used as input. In the second test, we used the right ASIS point and the left and right anterior point of the ischial tuberosity points. In the last test, we used the right ASIS point and the left and right midpoints between posterior and anterior points of the respective ischial tuberosities. The same regression lines were used and the mean of a in Table 2 was used to compute the hip joint point. The results (Table 4) show that our method is accurate as well as robust. The H-point calculated using mid- points of the ischial tuberosities are fairly comparable with the posterior points and, for the females, it is even better than the posterior points. We believe this is because H is not exactly coplanar with the points A, IL and IR. H is slightly forward, near the plane determined by the point A and two mid-points on the ischial tuberosity. These results are important since, in the seated posture, subjects most likely are seated at some point between the anterior and posterior aspects of the ischial tuberosities. Other researchers have described various procedures for locating the hip joint. Andraicchi, et al [1 1] defined the hip joint to be 1.5cm distal to the midpoint of a line 504</page><page sequence="8">connecting the ASIS to the pubic symphysis. Tylkowski, et al [12] described the hip center in terms of a percentage of the inter-ASIS distance, with H-point located 11% medial to the ASIS, 12% inferior to the ASIS and 21% posterior to the ASIS. Bell, et al [13] described three methods for locating the hip joint center and used biplanar radiographs to determine their accuracy. They reported that a kinematic analysis of locating the hip center had an average error of 37.9mm, with errors ranging from 14mm to 63mm. The method described by Andracchi [11] had similar error ranges with an average error of 36.1mm and a range of 14.8mm to 44.0mm. The method described by Tylkowski [12] had average errors of 19mm and an error range of 4.9mm to 34.9mm. Others have modified the work of Tylkowski and co-workers. Manary, et al [14] used a modification of Tylkowski's method [12] to locate H-point and Seidel, et al [15] further improved this approach by examining 35 female and 30 male cadavers. They reported H-point to be located 14% of pelvic width medial to the ASIS, 34% of pelvic depth posterior and 79% of pelvic height inferior to the ASIS. The disadvantage of the above methods for locating H-point is the need to locate the pubic symphysis. This is a difficult area of the body to measure due to clothing and tissue overlying the area. In addition, many subjects would not feel comfortable with measurements taken at that area. The advantage of our method is the ease with which it can be adapted to the seated posture and the accuracy and robustness of the technique. REFERENCES 1. Reynolds, C. Snow and J.
