Imagine a world of abundance without pollution or war, where people live as long as they want and are able to hibernate through eras which do not interest them, choosing their own time and place to live. All this and more may become reality if the promoters of nanotech- nology are proved right. A rather more frightening sce- nario is presented by the author behind Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton, a former student of anthropology. His latest novel, Prey (2002), describes how a cloud of nanoro- bots develop into predators preying on humans. In real life, Prince Charles has recently joined the emerging nano- debate, irticulating his fears of nanotechnology's threat to kill life on earth (Rhodie 2003). Obviously 'nano' is becoming a new buzz word, but what is it about and is it of any interest to anthropology? Nanotechnology The word 'nano-' comes from the Greek nanos, meaning 'dwarf', and as a prefix means 'one-billionth' - in this case, to be precise, one billionth of a metre. If you take 1 millimetre and divide it by 1000 you get 1 micrometre: artefacts are mass-produced on this scale today. If you divide 1 micrometre by 1000 you get 1 nanometre. Objects measured in nanometres are on the scale of single mole- cules and atoms: a human hair, for example, is approxi- mately 10,000 nm thick. Below 10 nm is the quantum level, where matter starts to behave like waves and the world becomes notoriously unpredictable. Similarly, at the level of observable 'reality', where objects are measured in scales of millimetres and metres, the human sphere is affected by the unpredictability of cultural and emotion- ally coloured perceptions. In the middle, between the culturally chaotic world of humankind and the apparent chaos of the quantum world, extends the nanoworld, hidden for most of us but incor- ruptible and stable for the nanoscientists. It is a world without colours or invidualizing characteristics, since all atoms of a given kind are identical. Nanotechnology, engaging with the smallest existing stable matter, could take human creativity to its most sophisticated level - but in the process it might spell the end of nature. Anthropological interest in nanoscience emerges as part of a large body of anthropological literature on new tech- nology (see e.g. Downey 1998, Franklin 1998, Gusterson 1996, Harraway 1997, Helmreich 1998a, Knorr Cetina 1999, Rabinow 1996 and 1999, Strathern 1992b, Traweek 1988). However, perhaps because the nanotechnology rev- olution is yet to get under way, nanotechnology has not yet, as far as I know, attracted the interest of other anthro- pologists. In my own research, I am grappling with the implications this new technology has for human cultural life as conceived within anthropology. To understand how the emerging nanotechnology impacts human life, both inside and outside a scientific community, I have been con- ducting fieldwork at the Microtechnology Centre at Chalmers (MC2) in Gothenburg, recently renamed the Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience. With an area of 25,000 square metres and employing 200 researchers, this is one of the most modern university cleanroom laboratories in the world. The community of scientists engaged in nanoscience in Sweden is of interna- tional background, and like many scientists they argue that culture, ethnicity and gender are irrelevant to their science. Another aspect of my research relates to the differing expectations among scientists, on the one hand, and the general public, on the other, of what this new technology may bring in the near future. Since laypeople mainly learn about this technology from novelists like Michael Crichton, they associate nanoscience with minuscule robots and the like. To the scientists I study, however, the technology is more about new materials than about machines. Towards a new physics? As nanoscience develops it may change our worldview in the same way that quantum mechanics changed the world of the early 1900s, when the clockwork image of a stable Newtonian universe was replaced by a relativist and uncertain Einsteinian worldview. According to quantum physicist Erwin Schridinger, humans would never be able to experiment on single atoms or small molecules as they are not well-defined entities (Regis 1995). Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that quantum particles are sub- ject to a degree of uncertainty when measuring their ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 19 NO 6, DECEMBER 2003 3</page><page sequence="2">U m "TI,- i ?? ? n. ii"i  , l' '  . ...... . i " ...

But what will happen when the uncertain world turns out to be more certain than we have been led to believe? In 1980 the physicist Hans Dehmelt managed to trap a single atom for 10 months, proving Schr6dinger wrong. In an act of anthropomorphic jest, Dehmelt named the atom Astrid. Five years later the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) was invented, making it possible to have mechinical contact with single atoms. In 1989 IBM arranged 35 xenon atoms to spell out the company's logo, creating the world's smallest advertisement; in the process they proved that atoms can be positioned with precision (Peterson 1995) - although positioning the xenon atoms required cooling them to a temperature of a few degrees above absolute zero, making the procedure unsuitable for large-scale production (Merkle 1997). By 1990 there was plenty of evidence that prime matter like atoms could be manipulated and that the world of atoms was more stable than quantum physicists commonly imagined. The success of these experiments raises the question of whether the nanoscience era will usher in a new worldview based on the principle of stability. According to Mihail Roco of the US National Science Foundation, we now stand at the threshold of a new Renaissance. The scientists of the old Renaissance were holistically seeking knowl- edge in all fields (Roco &amp; Bainbridge 2002). In the same way, Roco suggests, nanoscience will become the meeting point for engineers, biologists, chemists and physicists, creating a new breed of scientists studying the most ele- mentary of nature's stable building blocks. The scientists of old discussed everything from poetry and philosophy to physics, while Roco's new Renaissance scientists seem principally to mix different natural sciences. Will the new Renaissance create new kinds of 'knowl- edge societies' run by experts? According to Knorr Cetina (1999), the most important holders of knowledge in the world are the scientific institutions, which produce epis- temic cultures, that is cultures that create and legitimize knowledge. Since societies and cultures are transformed and influenced by such communities of 'experts', it is important that anthropologists study these experts. If Roco is right, the most important epistemic culture of all, with the greatest impact on society, will soon be that of the nanoscientists. Sharon Traweek's description of high- energy physicists may be just as true for nanoscientists. The physicists' calling is awesome: memoirs and biog- raphies often present this corps d'dlite as unique, Promethean heroes of the search for truth. Traditionally the mysteries of the universe have been the province of theologians and priests. Physicists of course do not see themselves as writing the cosmology of some secular reli- gion: for them, religion is about belief rather than knowl- edge. But they do see their own profession as the revelation and custody of fundamental truth, and to a sur- prising degree Western culture confirms them in this priv- ileged role. 'They bring news of another world: hidden but stable, coherent, and incorruptible' (Traweek 1992: 2). From bulk technology to nanotechnology In 1986 Eric Drexler, the 'guru' of nanotechnology pub- lished the first non-technical book on nanotechnology, Engines of creation. Earlier in 1981 he published the first scientific paper on the subject. In his book he draws a dis- tinction between the bulk technology we have today, which is based on manipulating atoms in bulk, and nanotech- nology, which is based on manipulating individual atoms. To be able to manipulate matter at the atomic level, Drexler proposes the use of assemblers and replicators. Assemblers would be programmable molecular machines that could build virtually any molecular structure from Particles &gt; 0.5 pm diameter generated per minute from the human body: Action Ordinary clothes Clean room clothes Sitting, slight hand movements 500 000 15 000 Standing up 2 500 80 Walking slowly 5 (00 000 150 000 Running 10 000 0( 300 000 4 ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 19 NO 6, DECEMBER 2003</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 4.

An expensive airfiltration system dries the air before re-humidifying it, sending it through large vents surrounding the cleanroom. Special vibration reducing pillars support the structure.

Replicators are essential because if nanomachines are to be used efficiently in the human-scale world, the number required is exceedingly large. The ambition, therefore, is to build multi-purpose machines that are able both to replicate themselves and to assemble all kinds of molecules. Eric Drexler was, however, not the first to come up with the idea of manipulating single molecules and atoms. One of the more important events in the history of nanotech- nology occurred at the California Institute of Technology on 29 December 1959. The physicist Richard P. Feynman was to give an after-dinner talk at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society. The announced topic was 'There's plenty of room at the bottom'. In his speech he asked 'Why cannot we write the entire 24 volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica on the head of a pin?' According to Feynman, there was no question that there was enough room on the head of a pin to put all of Encyclopaedia Britannica there: there was not just enough room, but plenty of room at the bottom (Feynman 1960: 22-24). Towards the end of the talk he offered two prizes of US$1000 each. The first prize was to be awarded to the 'first guy who can take the information on the page of a book and put it on an area 1/25,000 smaller in linear scale [representing a font height of approximately 100nm] in such manner that it can be read by an electron micro- scope'. The second prize was for the first who could make an operating electric motor in a 1/64-inch cube, about 4 mm. He finished his speech by saying 'I do not expect that such prizes will have to wait very long for claimants' (Feynman 1960: 36). And he was right: already the following year an engi- neer named William H. McLellan built the motor (Regis 1995). However, the prize for reducing a page from a book was not claimed until 1985. This happened to be the first page of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities, which begins appropriately enough: 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness...' (Regis 1995). According to the promoters of nanotechnology, the shift from bulk technology to nanotechnology would be like moving from the age of foolishness, wasting large amounts of energy and creating pollution in the process, to an age of wisdom in which individual molecules are built to order, creating no waste and no pollution. The new tech- nology, it is suggested, will allow for the restoration of nature and an improvement in the human standard of living. In the view of Drexler and other promoters of nan- otechnology, the new science will lead to a new era'of abundance. The problem of pollution will not only be eliminated; with nanomachines it will also be possible to handle the damage done by bulk technology as assemblers will break down harmful materials into molecules and rebuild them as harmless or even useful materials (Drexler, Peterson &amp; Pergamit 1991). Solar energy will be cheap and effective with nanotechnology, creating enough energy for all. Even within the short-term perspective of 10 to 15 years, 'nanotechnology-based lighting advances have the potential to reduce world-wide consumption of energy by more than 10%, reflecting savings of $100 bil- lion dollars per year and a corresponding reduction of 200 million tons of carbon emissions' (Roco 2001a: 7). As nanomachines are small, a nanofactory will also be small and automated. Together with cheap energy, nanofactories will produce all kinds of products, from food to computers and cars, cheaply (Drexler 1990). Notwithstanding the allegedly gender-neutral position of science, nanoscience may come to have far-reaching consequences for men and women. Stefan Helmreich (1998b) suggests that some, mostly male, artificial life computer scientists seek to create artificial worlds out of 'frustration' at not being able to create 'naturally'. From this perspective nanoscience may be seen as the answer to male researchers' birth envy, since the new science could make women irrelevant as creators of new life. For the enthusiasts, nanotechnology will mean the end of poverty. The industrial world does not need to lower or change its standard of living: nanotechnology will solve our pollution and raw material problems. Nanoscience becomes a technique which will enable industrial society to continue without the collapse of nature. No wonder that politicians and policy-makers are so fond of the new tech- nology. In the view of the sceptics, nanoscience might never work. When the nanotechnology company Zyvex attempted to construct artefacts atom by atom it proved so difficult that they had to abandon the idea (Ashley 2002). The 1996 Nobel laureate in chemistry, Richard E. Smalley (2001), wrote an article in Scientific American with the telling subtitle 'How soon will we see the nanometer-scale robots envisaged by K. Eric Drexler and other molecular nanotechnologists? The simple answer is never'. According to Smalley there are at least two major prob- lems with molecular robots, fat fingers and sticky fingers. The fat finger problem is that self-replicating nanorobots will be too large to be able to manipulate single atoms and molecules. Smalley paraphrases Feynman's 'There's plenty of room at the bottom', commenting 'but there's not that much room' (2001:77). The sticky finger problem means that manipulated atoms will stick to the atom-sized robots. During my ongoing fieldwork among nanoscientists, I have found them to have a more 'sober' attitude towards the new technology. Many of them do not know who Drexler is and they do not follow the 'popular' debate on nanotechnology.

This chip helps medical scientists in their research, in some cases replacing a large lab, as it is possible to make full-scale analyses ofsamples on this miniaturized device. This technology is exciting as it combines physics and engineering, in the construction of the chip, with biology and chemistry in the experiments it is used for. .S0 one scientist he exclaimed 'But it doesn't work!' in refer- ence to assemblers and replicators, suggesting that nanoscience is still a long way from fulfilling the expecta- tions of its enthusiasts. I found a huge gap between laypeople's expectations of the new technology and the scientists' awareness of the problems involved in achieving them. A division arises between an ideal and a real technology, what might work and what really does work. Laypeople are not aware of the problems facing the new technology, as they are not able to follow the scien- tific discussion. The products created by nanoscientists today are inno- vative, but will not revolutionize the whole of society. They consist mostly of new materials rather than nanomachines. For example, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) might replace normal light bulbs. When tested in traffic lights in Stockholm, the new technology resulted in energy savings of up to 90 percent and a reduction in the cost of replacing bulbs. Another nanotechnological product - a self-cleaning window - was introduced in 2002. A special coating, 50 nm thick, reacts with sunlight to break down and loosen dirt particles. When water is applied to the window it washes the dirt away. The water is distributed evenly on the window, creating no 'drying spots'. A new world order? At a visit to Caltech on 21 January 2000, the then US pres- ident Bill Clinton declared that we have entered the nanoworld, and announced the National Nanotechnology Initiative. It is predicted that over the next 10-15 years annual worldwide industrial nano-production will increase to more than $1 trillion, requiring about two million nanoscientists worldwide (Rocko 2001b). Will the new technology lead to a new world order? There are at least three possible scenarios. The first scenario assumes the bonding of transnational capital with science and technology, creating a few large transnational corporations: this is the scenario described by Donna Harraway (1997) as New World Order, Inc. In this scenario nanotechnology will only be available to a few private entrepreneurs. One may remember that it was IBM, one of the world's largest corporations, who first arranged single atoms to form letters spelling out the cor- porate logo. The second scenario envisages nation-states using nano- technology to strengthen their competitive position. On the basis of current investment, the three dominant blocks would be the USA, Europe and Japan. The development of nanotechnology is expensive and few corporations are able to make the necessary long-term investment. However, nanoscientists themselves will continue to cir- culate in a global arena, changing their workplaces and exchanging their ideas all over the world. The third scenario is that everyone in the world becomes rich since it is possible to produce almost any product at low cost. The nation-states would no longer need to control and tax their populations, as the people would no longer be needed in produc- tion with nanomachines to do the work. Every country would be self-sufficient and there would be no reason for wars or large armies. Moreover, according to Drexler, the nanotechnology rev- L olution will free people to return to 'primitive ways of life' (1990: 235). Since governments no longer need the natural resources of their land, people will be free to lead a rural way of life. This scenario will lead to anarchy, a world without leaders or laws, in which the individual has control over his or her own life. Culture vs nature If nanoscience works and comes anything near to realizing its potential, the most drastic changes for humans would probably be those to life itself, since nanoscientists are cre- ating artefacts from prime matter. At this level there is no difference between living and dead matter: every mole- cule, including DNA, follows the same physical laws. The nuclear level of existence is thus where the artificial and natural meet: at this level there are no differences between a natural and an artificially built molecule. The body and machines are used as parallel metaphors for culture: bodies live, while machines work. According to Marilyn Strathern, bodies and machines may be used as metaphors for one another, one describing the natural order and the other the artificial. In the Western world, cul ture is described as an organic body with a will to act, while at the same time being represented, through a mechanical metaphor, as having a ratchet-like structure (Strathern 1992b). Some biologists are beginning to blur this symbolic dichotomy between the organic and the inor- ganic. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, for example, proclaims: 'We are the survival machines - robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish mole- cules known as genes' (quoted in Helmreich 1998b: 220). Nanotechnology may thus dissolve this fundamental dis- tinction between machine and body, dead and living matter. Eric Drexler uses the term biochauvinism to describe the belief that biological systems are superior to others and have a monopoly on self-reproduction and intelligence: a nanomachine that can replicate itself and use the sun for energy would be just as alive as a cell (Drexler 1990). Nature might not be perfect, but it is believed that humans, with the help of nanotechnology, might be able to 'correct' its imperfections. One such 'error' of nature is the aging and death of cells, causing the aging and death of humans. With the help of nanomachines cells could be repaired and new cells built, allowing humans to live for- ever. Also biostasis might be possible, enabling humans to sleep through years, even decades. This would pave the way for a certain kind of time travel, where people would choose the periods in which they want to live and those when they would like to be placed in biostasis, sleeping through 'boring' centuries (Drexler 1990). Just as the cloning debate today is asking questions about what kind of society we want to live in, the 'nano-debate' of tomorrow will ask what kind of world we want to create with the new technology. For example, what would it mean for our notion of kinship if we were able to meet our great-great-great-grandchildren? And would it be a breach of the incest taboo if you married one of them? According to Paul Rabinow public discourse, especially in the field of health, has shifted from sociobiology, engi- neering society according to scientific principles, to bioso- ciality, a culturization of the natural (Franklin 1995, Rabinow 1992). Nature is remade by humans and becomes artificial, a part of culture. Marilyn Strathern argues that a prevailing idea in our Western culture is that 'culture con- sumes nature' (1992a: 5). The expansion of culture replaces forests with houses, soil with asphalt and horses with cars; little by little nature disappears. With nanotech- nology all becomes artificial, as nanotechnology manipu- lates prime matter. Nature, matter not invented or culturized by humans, would cease to exist. So, even if there is plenty of room at the bottom, there might not be enough space for nature. * 6 ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 19 NO 6, DECEMBER 2003</page><page sequence="6">NANO-PURITY AND CLEANLINESS This advertisement by a Swedish company specializing in technologically advanced workwear, including cleanroom clothing, illustrates Mikael Johansson's article on the anthropology of nanotechnology in this issue (pp. 3-6). Juxtaposing modern scientific ideas about purity and cleanliness with the religious, the advertisement suggests that although nuns and nano-scientists wear similar clothing, their concerns are very different: while nuns may aspire to moral purity in their renunciatory vocation, to modern science they and their clothing are as polluting to the laboratory environment as all other animate beings. Mother Sabrina exchanges her nun's habit for scientifically engineered clothing and thus reduces particle emissions into the environment. Clothing as a symbol of moral purity is contrasted with that produced for the practical purpose of reducing environmental pollution in the workplace. The heart of nanotechnology research is the cleanroom where experimentation takes place. In the minute context of the nanometer scale, a sin- gle microscopic dust particle is gigantic, posing enormous risks to experiments. By far the most contaminating presence in a cleanroom are humans, who drop about 10,000 skin particles per minute, each 3,000-5,000 nanometres across. Humans must cover their bodies in pro- tective clothing, not to protect themselves from experiments, but to protect experiments from their own dirt. In such an environment human behaviour needs to be strictly controlled, includ- ing regulating food and drink intake and body movement. According to one cleanroom manual, people who tend to be nervous, bad-tempered or have resistant to authority should not work in a cleanroom as they are more likely to contami- nate the area. Cleanrooms are specially engi- neered to withstand vibration generated by out- side sources such as cars and inside sources such as machines. Visible light with a bandwidth of 400-800 nm needs to be strictly controlled with light filters as this can ruin experiments. The heavily regulated nano-lab is clearly dis- tinct from the cloister, but they are not without similarities and interesting inversions. Both deal with worlds invisible to the naked eye and are in one way or another deeply concerned with purity and regulating human behaviour. If the mysteries of the universe and ontological truths used to be the province of theologians and priests, natural scientists today see their vocation as revealing and acting as custodians of fundamental truth.
