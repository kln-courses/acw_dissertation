The feeling for beauty plays an important part in life. Painting, sculpture, music, and poetry, though offering no material advantages, have attracted to themselves a degree of skill, effort and labour hardly in- ferior to that given to industries obviously useful; and their successful exponents have received honour and rewards comparable to those of the great leader or statesman. Not only in work definitely undertaken from artistic impulse, but in all the products of his industry, in his choice of locality, in his dwelling, his clothes and his implements, man shows that he is affected by appearance, by something that causes him pleasure over and above the immediate utility of the object. If for the moment we can discard all the complicated intellectual processes that play so large and important a part in artistic enjoyment the pleasures of recognition, suggestion, association, stimulation of ideas, etc., we find that rhythmical movement, or a harmonious combination of colour or sound can by themselves give rise to a simple feeling of pleasure, that is in- stinctive and quite independent of any mental or intellectual apprecia- tion of the cause. That is to say that the basis of our pleasure in beautiful things is an emotional response to an appropriate combination of colour, sounds or rhythmical movement. It is generally an easy matter to trace the origin of our emotions from useful instincts developed in the struggle for existence; - love, fear, anger, curiosity, acquisitiveness, emulation and so on, have all ob- viously an important survival value and so became stereotyped into in- stincts; can we say that the aesthetic emotion also is derived from some instinctive feeling sufficiently useful to the organism to have been thus developed and perpetuated ? Or are we to regard the artistic sense as a secondary or derived product, having perhaps some social value; not a real factor in the struggle for existence, but an outlet for superfluous energy and leisure time, an apotheosis of the play instinct? The usual view indeed is to regard art as an adjunct to the serious business of survival, and yet its deep emotional influence, its soul affecting power seem to force upon us the conclusion that it too, as in love, hate, or fear, must draw its strength from some old instinct deeply planted and firmly fixed, as only the long fight for life has power to do; that it must be possible to trace back the aesthetic emotion to some instinctive neces-</page><page sequence="2">Felix Clay, The origin of the Aesthetic Emotion. 283 sary function or activity, that subsequently, when refined and raised into the ideal regions by the intellect, becomes the artistic spirit. There is no doubt that the question as to the part played by the artistic sense in the struggle for existence owes its obscurity far less to any inherent difficulty in the question than to the perplexities caused by attempts to reconcile the far-reaching and important influence of art with various theories and definitions based upon the assumption of its non- utilitarian character. It has been dinned into us that Art must be spelt with a capital "A" and isolated from all relation to practical life; that Art for Art's sake is the only true line; until we are ready to believe that the dignity and value of Art is somehow enhanced by divorcing it from all practi- cal considerations, and to accept the view that any work or performance which can be shown to have a utilitarian purpose or end must be con- sidered not a genuine work of Art. This is partly a revolt against the misuse of the word art to cover mere skill, and is so far useful; but to a much greater degree it is due to the attempt to base a theory of Art upon a priori principles deduced from general philosophical considera- tions. Beauty we are to believe is a semi-transcendental reality of which an ideal is formed, so to speak, in the mind, from hints and fragments of the beautiful actually perceived; this then becomes the criterion by which beautiful things are to be judged, by the degree with which they approximate to this ideal standard. Art then is naturally the outcome of man's love of, and desire for, the beautiful; thus it had and has no further function than to satisfy that desire. Theories of Art there are by the score but except upon the negation of the useful there is little agreement to be found among them. Beauty has of course been defined as perfect fitness, and certain theories lay stress upon the essential connection of utility with aesthetic pleasure; but no suggestion is made as to the practical value to the in- dividual of aesthetic sensibility in itself, as conferring an advantage in the life struggle. The psychology of the Art emotion is affected by the Art for Art's sake theory; although all the other feelings and emotions are traced to old and useful instincts, the aesthetic emotion is at once put on a diffe- rent plane, as for example by Ribot in his recent valuable study on The Psychology of the Emotions. "While all the emotions hitherto enumerated have their origin and their raison d'etre in the preservation of the individual as an individual or as a social being, the aesthetic feeling, as we know, differs from the rest by the fact that the activity which produces it aims not at the accomplishment of a vital or social function, but at the mere pleasure of exercising itself".</page><page sequence="3">284 Felix Clay, The origin of the Aesthetic Emotion. If we are content to accept art as the development and outcome of some such purposeless activity as play, cadit quaestio; it is indeed a vain task to look for it as an important, or as any factor in the struggle for existence. Whatever view we may hold as to the ultimate connection between art and utility, it is impossible to deny their close interdependence in the earlier forms of Art. In Architecture it is certainly difficult to say exactly where the line is to be drawn between a nice adaptation of means to end and the beginning of Art proper. Music, which at first sight seems of all the arts the furthest removed from any utilitarian taint, has at all events among primitive and savage tribes a decidedly practical side. As a means of ensuring accuracy of concerted move- ment, maintaining discipline, rousing warlike ardour, music has an impor- tant part to play. As Richard Wallaschek points out in his Primitive Music. "It is this fact of the absolute utility of music in the daily life of people in primitive times that made it develop so late into an indepen- dent art", and again "With primitive man music, and painting and sculpture probably as well, are not purely aesthetic occupations in the modern sense; they are most intimately bound up with practical life-preserving and life- continuing activities, and receive only gradually their present more ab- stract forms". In fact, the more we come to understand the meaning of the various performances of primitive races the more clearly it appears that there is a distinct purpose and object underlying what have been long considered merely aesthetic amusements. The early efforts at ornament, the drawings and pantomimic dances so long considered as the product of a super- flous activity wiling away its leisure hour, and so begetting Art, have now been clearly shown to have a purpose - far from play, they were done in deadly earnest, a matter of life and death; they were mystic signs and spells of supposed efficacy in averting some dangerous influ- ence, in keeping some powerful demon in useful subjection, or at all events in propitiating his anger, or they were ideograms to convey infor- mation; however instrinsically valueless, by their authors they were looked upon as useful to the point of necessity. Why did such performances or works at once take a form that in many cases has still an appeal to our aesthetic sense? Obviously primi- tive man having conceived gods and demons of like form with themselves naturally offered them things that they valued or found pleasing. The moment that rudimentary skill was devoted to making use of colour or sound or movement, with or without a conscious aim at expression, it</page><page sequence="4">Felix Clay, The origin of the Aesthetic Emotion. 285 at once took some rhythmical or harmonious combination; determined at once by the emotional response that it called forth, this would like any other sense be quickly improved by use - (rules of composition are of course, as is not always remembered, only a short description of success- ful result and theory lags slowly after practice). The only explanation possible for this, is to suppose that there is some innate natural desire or instinctive feeling for harmony and rhythm. A particular form, a certain combination of colour, a particular sequence of sounds is prefe- rable to another; there must be some pre-existing sense ready to like or dislike, to take pleasure in one appearance not in another. To what is this to be attributed? "Why we receive pleasure from some forms and not from others is no more to be asked or answered than why we like sugar and dislike wormwood." Ruskin having made this statement was satisfied with the explanation that it was the simple will of the deity that we should be so created. It is however sufficiently obvious that taste would be so developed as to find wholesome i. e. nutritive things pleasant, and to reject unwholesome -- can we find a similar reason for our pleasure in harmony? Grant Allen some thirty years ago in his Physiological Aesthetics traced clearly the connection between colour and sound and the organs of sensation, showing that the actual mechanism in the eye and ear by response to vibratory stimuli, falling upon it with suitable intervals for recovery, would give rise to pleasurable feelings; thus demonstrating an obvious and direct explanation, at all events one step further back, of our likes and dislikes, the pleasantness of concord and the unpleasantness of discord, though why they come to be there in those forms he does not pretend to suggest. Emotions of any kind are always accompanied by certain bodily changes, alterations in the rate of breathing, the circulation and in the various secretions. This is sufficiently obvious in the dry mouth and odd internal sensation of fear, and the quick heart beat of anger. It is indeed true to say that no emotion can exist without such physical effects by which we are aware of the emotion, though in many cases these involuntary physiological alterations are too slight to be consciously notic- ed; so with the aesthetic emotion, in the gasp of admiration when con- fronted with something of great beauty, in the deep thrill and the queer cutaneous shiver caused by music, we are actually aware of a physical sensation that precedes conscious appreciation. "I always know" William Morris is reported to have said "when a thing is good as I feel warm across here", passing his hand over his waistcoat. Just as appropriate objects presented to perception will arouse the emo- tions of love, fear, anger, desire for food, etc., so will a harmonious or rhyth- mical combination of colour, sounds or form arouse the aesthetic emotion. S. d. IMG. IX. 19</page><page sequence="5">286 Felix Clay, The origin of the Aesthetic Bmotion. We can trace in the animal kingdom a similar emotional response in the case at all events of the principal instinctive feelings, - can we find the aesthetic instinct there too? In such a quest it is of the utmost importance to avoid the tendency to any anthropomorphic interpretation of the actions of an animal, we must keep a clear distinction between aesthetic judgment and an instinctive emotional response to harmonious sound or colour. The intellectual factor, by which the simple physio- logical impulses are raised into the ideal instincts of the higher life, must be rigorously eliminated when tracing the germs of our complicated emo- tional feeling from the primitive animal instincts. It is clear from the brilliant plumage of birds, from the gambols and antics of animals, and the songs and cries, produced chiefly at the most emotional periods of their lives i. e. at the breeding season, that there is among animals a strongly felt influence in rhythmical movement, combinations of colours, etc., but it is not correct to deduce from the fact of the male bird being brightly coloured, a power of conscious selection upon aesthetic grounds in the female. Such a choice would involve a degree of mental power which we are not entitled to attribute to animals, nor must we use our own standard of beauty in considering whether a given animal or race has an aesthetic sense. A Hottentot finds his womankind beautiful how- ever repulsively ugly they are to us, male baboons with their (to us) hideous patches of blue and red, may rouse a thrill of aesthetic emotion as truly the same in kind as the beautiful (to us) combination of colour in the peacock's tail may do in the heart of the pea-hen. Of course the sexual instinct plays so large a part in the feeling for beauty that it is hardly possible to be sure when we have completely eliminated the far-reaching ramifications of this all potent instinct, for even if not direct- ly involved it still colours and influences the other emotions. What- ever part this plays it does not alter the fact of the emotional response to beauty of colour, form or sound, apart from any further considerations. Hirn, in a very able discussion of the whole question of second- ary sexual characteristics in his Origins of Art states very clearly the objections to the selection theory, suggesting finally that in addition to the advantages of bright colour for recognition, the bright points of co- lour and their shining lustre, accentuated by the rapid and rhythmical movements of the male bird would have a strong effect in arousing emo- tional excitement in the female, thus helping to overcome her reluctance or coyness. There is good ground for believing that the coyness and reluctance of the female is valuable for the preservation of purity of species; con- sequently all the means that helped a male of the right kind to over- come this would be valuable. Anything that aroused any emotion would</page><page sequence="6">Felix Clay, The origin of the Aesthetic Emotion. 287 be of great help, since as is well known the excitement of any one emo- tion tends to overflow, and awakening other feelings to enhance all the emotional life. The beauty of the contrasted colours, notes of the song, or graceful actions of the male must be considered as arousing an in- stinctive emotional response in the female (at the same time no doubt enhancing his own feelings), and the necessary union would follow, not because the female consciously selected one male as the most beautiful or the strongest, but because one particular male was so constituted as to colour etc. as to raise the female to the required pitch of emotional excitement sooner or more completely than another. This may sound like describing choice in a roundabout way, but it is essentially different; choice involves a rational process in which a conscious comparison is made, whereas in such a case as that of the bird it is as incorrect to call it selection, as it would be to say that a fly selects the appro- priate material upon which to deposit its egg; the right sort of food for the grub, and that only, arouses the train of feeling or emotion which ends in the deposit of the eggs. In connection with the unconscious nature of the effect of colours we should remember that the same phe- nomena of secondary sexual characteristics are found in many insects and certain fish. Given such instinctive deep seated emotional response to rhythmical movement, harmonious sound and colour, it is easy to see in what varied forms it would be made use of; the leader would stimu- late his men to acts of bravery by rhythmic movement, poetry and music, as well as would the lover sing to his mistress; since any emotion at once tends to inhibit the calculating reason in favour of impulsive action. We are now brought face to face with the question put in the early part of the article - why should emotional response to harmony or rhythm as such, whether in sound, colour or form, have a survival value ? Of all the factors that determined survival in the earliest stages of life suitability or adaptability to environment was the most important. An organism that drifted into unsuitable surroundings or whose environ- ment changed unfavourably, ceased to exist; but if in some among them a variation appeared by which that organism became more quickly aware that the surrounding conditions were beginning to be unfavourable and could thus use whatever activity or power they possessed to gain those more suitable, they would tend to survive. A quicker reaction to exter- nal stimulus, a slight change in chemical composition, a chance move- ment that happened to restore a harmonious interaction between the organism and the external world would by helping the individual tend to become stereotyped. Such useful activities would of course be blind, spontaneous, automatic; fixed by the process of selection by survival they would follow the stimulus as simply and surely as a chemical reac- 19*</page><page sequence="7">288 Felix Clay, The origin of the Aesthetic Emotion. tion, needing, however complicated, no conscious guidance. When how- ever in the process of development came consciousness and memory and with it the power of volition, it is obvious that dawning intelligence would be likely to interfere with activities often laborious and inconvenient, the immediate use and advantage of which was of course entirely unintelli- gible. A further influence seemed necessary to ensure the due carrying out of necessary instincts. If the due performance of function gave rise to an immediate feeling of pleasure, it would tend to be repeated for its own sake; this is sufficiently obvious in many of our instinctive pleasures. We fall in love without thinking of or perhaps desiring children, we continue to hunt though we have no need of the quarry. Thus through- out the long struggle for existence any actions which tended to render the environment more suitable to the organism having a survival value would be stereotyped into instincts, the due performance of which would give rise to pleasure, this pleasure would, by a commonplace of psycho- logy, be projected outwards and considered as a quality of the object with which it was connected. Obviously then, any object that had been made or was naturally adapted to produce a harmonious interaction with the organism would be as such pleasing or beautiful. Pleasing things, especially if also necessary, are of course sought for and desired, consequently we should get wishes or cravings for such har- monious interactions, thus harmony would come to be as it were the touchstone of value. If we are to realise how this would produce the feeling for and appreciation of beauty we must disabuse our minds of any transcendental ideal beauty, or the idea that there are abstract and immu- table laws of harmony and composition, which, could we find them, would enable us to produce a perfect and final beauty; nor should we wonder why nature is always right aesthetically, why flowers and birds and scenery are so full of beauty, the whole statement should be reversed - they are beautiful to us because we like them and they give us pleasure not that we like them because they are beautiful. Beauty is not a final perfect thing, but as our senses and intellect become more developed we shall, as we advance, be able to realise and to see a higher and a greater beauty. Our organs have been developed by, and formed to meet, the condi- tions of the environment and thus by one long effort to live in harmony with nature, and where harmony it is beauty. The law of the universe is balance, rhythmical action and reaction, systole and diastole. An organism developing on it and moulded by its conditions, must necessarily for itself be so formed as to respond to this law however concealed. It does not seem unreasonable to suppose that the instinctive pleasure in harmony is due to the impelling need for suitability to environment; and</page><page sequence="8">Felix Clay, The origin of the Aesthetic Emotion. 289 that to any organism the power of feeling the first sign however faint that it was out of touch with its surroundings, instead of merely proving it by living or dying, would have an inestimable value in the struggle for existence, so that such powers would be quickly increased and deve- loped. If we look at this unconscious craving which we may fairly call an instinct for conformity with nature, or more shortly for harmony in its widest sense, we see it expressed at first in unconscious discomfort the moment the conditions begin to be unsuitable, driving the organism to unceasing effort only relaxed if and when harmonious adjustment is again attained. When at last the intellect is developed the aim of the instinctive cravings will be definitely conceived, and the necessary effort concentrated to gain the desired result. Suitable and beautiful surroun- dings will be desired in order that all the perceptions may be har- monious. "Art" says G. Santeyana in The Life of Reason "is action which transcending the body renders the world a more congenial stimulus to the soul". If we take this pregnant definition from the ideal region to the practical, we may fairly say that the prototype of Art is activity devoted to making the environment more suitable to the organism in the physical material sense, such for example, as the caddice making his shell, the beaver his dam and the birds their nests, - in man these be- come the useful industries developing with the industrial arts. In the gradual process by which the primitive instincts are raised into the regions of the ideal, we see the same forms repeated but in a spiri- tual instead of a material sense. All the physical feelings, impulses, pleasures etc. have their counterpart in the intellectual life. Our brain can only conceive ideas based upon felt experiences but can carry them into an ideal world unhampered by time and space or refractory material, just as the abstract perfectness of mathematics is based upon observed physical phenomena. So in Art, the mind realising the felt beauty of things perceived and the power of rhythm can combine portions of the external world of colour form. or sound in novel combinations producing new and often more intense sensations of pleasure, but always guided and limited by the felt need of harmony. But this pleasure-sensation is of course only the basis or so to speak stimulus, and the result must be what the mind finds in it. The intellect, the higher reason must be satisfied and here we see the instinct demanding a life that shall be spiritually and mentally in accord with the meaning of the universe. Just as the other instincts and emotions are raised either to serve the highest aspirations of man or to serve for simple sensual gratification, so will the use of the aesthetic sense be what it is made. The old, very useful instinct of curiosity will drive one to listen at a keyhole, another</page><page sequence="9">290 Felix Clay, The origin of the Aesthetic Emotion. to spend a life of scientific research. We may use the emotional response to beauty of colour and sound merely as an added relish to the enjoy- ments of the lower senses, or we may add its stimulating suggestiveness to help the soul forward on its highest flights. Art in its best and fullest sense must help to meet the wants of the ideal instinct, it must tell us some hint of the relation of nature to man, for harmonious relation be- tween them is the unconscious goal of all our effort, for if we could read the meaning and end of the universe and put ourselves in real conform- ity with it we should have reached perfect happiness. Art indeed is the interpretation of environment. "No art", says Ruskin, "can be noble which is incapable of expressing thought". Beauty has been defined as truth. "Rien n'est beau que le vrai", says Boileau, and this is so far true that the recognition of truth in the intellectual sphere closely corresponds with the direct feeling of true relationship in the physical. We need not suppose that the artist must always have any conscious message or definite idea before him when he works, he feels a sense of the mystery of life, a meaning in things too subtle to formulate, a beauty, some suggestion of harmony, the emotional response to which spurs him to expression, he tries to let us feel it as he feels it and if he is successful he wakens old instinctive cravings and undefined longings, the emotions are touched, there grows a deeper mean- ing in life, a higher and wider sphere opens before us, the senses are quickened and under the spur we are able to combine portions of ex- perience in some new way and find a connection, a truth unthought of before. Just as a natural beauty may seem to have a message for us, so may a work of art appear to tell us much that the creator had not, and could not have had, in his mind, - it is we ourselves that have found the beauty or the idea within ourselves under the stimulus of the emotional excite- ment; so may. a child musician with a great natural gift of harmony bring a message to many of things that he cannot know. The richer the mind, the wider the experience, the deeper the stored impressions of the memory, so the greater the response to beauty when once the emotion has been touched and. the rich store of association tapped. A great work of art draws out the best that is in us, it gives a richer, fuller sense of life; it helps us on the way to self realisation as a vehicle for intui- tion of the world around us. So we ask our artists, since no one can yet show the way to a practical life free from disharmonies, at least to create an ideal world for us, in which we may catch a glimpse of pure and perfect harmony, a momentary resting place for the soul.</page></plain_text>
