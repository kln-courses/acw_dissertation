The aim of the paper is to protest against the confusion of the concepts of soul and self. The self, the I, is ignored by contemporary psychology. For this neglect of the self in psychology there are apparently two chief reasons: (I) the self is so constant a fact in introspection that one simply forgets to name it; (2) the traditional, historical confusion of the term 'self' with 'soul.' 'Self' is used in this paper to mean the object of observation expressed in the words, 'I am conscious of myself.' It is indefinable (being in a class by itself); but is not therefore necessarily elemental and indescribable. It is a persisting, perceiving, developing, unique, complex and related self. Whereas the con- cept 'self' is primarily psychological, 'soul' is, on the other hand, common in philosophies and is even pre-philosophical. There are three chief meanings for the term 'soul': (I) the biological or vitalistic, which makes soul equiva- lent to life; (2) the metaphysical or immaterialistic, which makes the soul equivalent to the not-body; (3) the psychological notion of a conscious being which perceives, feels and thinks. It is significant in tracing these three con- ceptions through the history of thought to find that from the earliest days men appear to have held this third view of the soul along with one or both of the others. Plato somewhat confusedly combined all three. Aristotle con- ceived the soul vitalistically and psychologically. Stoic, Judeo-Alexandrian, Neo-Platonic, Patristic and Scholastic thinkers handed down the triple con- ception, while emphasizing the immaterialistic view. Augustine emphasized the psychological conception by insisting that the soul knows itself; yet he held along with this the conventional view of the sopl, unreconciled to the other, although in juxtaposition. Descartes, by formulating the mechanistic con- ception of life, almost destroyed the biological pretensions of the soul; he still, 213</page><page sequence="2">214 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. however, allowed it a precarious seat in the pineal gland. Though never free from the immaterialistic view, he makes much use of the psychological con- ception. Locke, while still holding to the vitalistic concept, dismissed the immaterialistic, and gave over almost all concrete characters of the soul to the self. Modern thinkers, attacking the vitalistic and immaterialistic views, have dismissed the soul altogether-even the psychological conception. Owing to this historic confusion of self with the soul they have unwisely re- jected the directly experienced self, the basic fact of psychology. The remedy requires the reinstatement of the self in psychology and that the self shall take over all the psychological attributes of the soul. The term 'soul' shall hence- forth be dismissed or retained as a mere synonym for conscious self. MARIE T. COLLINS. Classic and Romantic Trends in Plato. J. LOEWENBERG. Harvard Theo- logical Review, X, 3, pp. 2I5-236. The problem of the One and the Many is the center of Plato's philosophy, for his chief speculative endeavor was the search for unity. Of unity he had two conceptions: a unity antagonistic to the many, and a unity compounded of the many. Hence his romantic trend appears in emphasizing the conflict between unity and multiplicity, while his classic trend consists in his teaching as to the reconciliation of the universal and the particular. As a romanticist, he considered the world of particulars to be, from one point of view, negative and grotesque, but from the philosophical point of view, symbolical or sug- gestive of a transcendent realm of unity. As a classicist, he presents the con- ception of a unity resulting from the harmonization of the One and the Many into an organic whole. Plato's two conceptions of unity promise to afford a basis for defining most of the problems connected with classicism and roman- ticism in art and in philosophy. ERNEST BRIDGES. Ritschl's Criterion of Religious Truth. EDGAR S. BRIGHTMAN. American Journal of Theology, XXI, 2, pp. 212-224. The study of Ritschlianism is rendered difficult by the belief that Ritschl's thought is a closely knit logical unity, and also by the belief that his central doctrine is that of the value-judgment. Both beliefs are misleading. In his Rechtfertigung und Versahnung, he lays much stress on values, but not so much as on other ideas, such as the community, revelation in Christ, and the Kingdom of God. He held that the business of the science of theology was to formulate the faith of the Christian community. The theologian must be a genuine member of the Christian community, and start with the presupposi- tion of the truth of the community's faith in Jesus Christ. His central doctrine was not a theory of values but an emphasis upon the norms and traditions of the religious community. He rejected the doctrine of the testimonium spirits sancti on the ground that the Spirit is never really given to the individual as such, but only to the individual as a member of the community. He rejected</page><page sequence="3">No. 2. ] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 215 metaphysics because it could never lead us to know the God revealed to the Christian community. He held that religion involved value-judgments, but these value-judgments were an affair of the community, a means of mutual understanding among Christians; they could not prove the truth of Chris- tianity to a Buddhist or a Mohammedan. Christianity did not derive its truth from its value; rather it was valuable because it was Christian. How- ever, Ritschl used other standards of truth besides the faith of the community. Thus he sometimes appeals to the individual's consciousness of ethical activity and spiritual dignity. At other times he appeals to immediate experience. He failed to correlate these three criteria. He over-emphasized the idea of the community, and failed to understand the immanence of God. He did not appreciate the evangelistic and missionary character of Christianity. At the same time, he has brought us the fruitful message that religious truth is pri- marily social. W. CURTIS SWABEY. Ritschl's Ulse of Value-Judgments. E. ALBERT COOK. American Journal of Theology, XXI, 4, pp. 545-553. Ritschl held that in religion we seek for a solution of the contradiction which man finds in himself as a part of the order of nature and as a spiritual being. Religion gives man mastery over, and superiority to, the order of nature. The basis of religious knowledge, of belief in the Christian God, is our belief in the infinite value of human personality, which we see ought to dominate the world, and the positive value realized when we believe that it does dominate the world. Theoretical knowledge cannot vindicate the conclusions of religious knowledge. Both materialism and idealism are one-sided and are ultimately based on an aberrant religious impulse. The theoretical reason, however, is obliged to recognize the reality of the spiritual life, and thus the validity of religious knowledge, which is, however, exclusively reached by the method of value-judgements. The divinity of Christ consists in his overcoming of the world, his patient endurance, his love of man, and his spiritual independence. In that overcoming of the world for himself, and in the power to overcome the world which we receive through faith in the principles of his life, and in that life as a manifestation of the eternal God who guarantees to us final superiority over the world, we recognize Christ's divinity. Ritschl is right in saying that we have no knowledge of God which leaves out of account man's spiritual nature. The strongest evidence of the existence of God is, as Ritschl says, man's experience of God's power, in man's attainment of mastery over the world. But this is not the only evidence; science and history also furnish evidence which can be interpreted in the light of religious truth. W. CURTIS SWABEY. What is a Dogma? EDOUARD LEROY. The Monist, XXVII, 4, PP. 481-523. The object of this article is to place suggestive solutions before those com- petent to render a decision. At present the real difficulty in questions of</page><page sequence="4">2i6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. dogma is with postulates and with the manner of approaching the investi- gation. Keeping this fact in mind, we must consider first four current objec- tions to the idea of dogma. (I) Dogmas are considered undemonstrable, whereas modern thought demands proof, especially of vital propositions. (2) Where indirect proofs have been given, these have appealed to authority and have had too much the character of attempts to impose external facts on the individual. But facts, to be assimilated, must be complements of previous knowledge. (3) Dogmas are ambiguous, reflecting both the context of anti- quated philosophical theories and certain anthropomorphic conceptions, and hence many accept them uncritically. (4) Dogmas seem to be unrelated to the ordinary body of knowledge and hence to efficient intellectual life. Thus they seem useless at a time when the value of truth is measured by its service- ability in vivifying knowledge. Such being the objections to the idea of dogma, there are some lessons to be drawn from them. In themselves the arguments are irrefutable, but it can be shown that the postulate on which they are based is erroneous. Indeed, dogmas are supposed to have scientific significance be- cause emphasis is placed on the intellectual and not on the practical and moral side of a dogma. We must, then, attempt to arrive at a satisfactory idea of dogma. In this attempt, examples of dogmas-such as those of the divine personality, the real presence, or the resurrection of Jesus-show us that the first function of dogmas is not the communication of certain theoretical bits of knowledge, for we can not render explicit the implications of the dogmas. Dogmas formulated to point out errors attack the fallacious doctrine only after placing themselves at its point of view. Hence they should be considered in terms of what they oppose; for, in themselves, they do not formulate truth and they can only be understood by reference to their historical origin. It is evident, then, that from a theoretical standpoint, the dogma has a negative meaning, yet its principal value is its positive meaning. There are important consequences of realizing that dogmas concern conduct rather than reflective knowledge. Such being the case, the examples of dogmas already indicated have significance. Furthermore, the objections stated are invalid, for in certain conditions where logic would be impossible, action can solve the problem; one may, in the realm of action, submit by act of free will to author- ity; dogmas are intelligible as regulations of conduct; and they have a self- evident relation to efficient life. Having seen the relation beween dogma and action, we can better understand that between dogma and thought. Dogmas, as guides to action, may be speculated on so long as speculation finds justifica- tion for rules. When theory attacks the dogma, however, the dogma stands as a condemnation of the theory and thus assumes a negative meaning. Dog- mas, then, are constant in their practical aspect but changeable in their theoretical. Hence, though the intellectualist conception of dogma presents unanswerable difficulties, a doctrine of the primacy of action does not, in permitting solution, deprive thought or dogma of its rights. MARJORIE S. HARRIS.</page><page sequence="5">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 2I7 La logique phenomenale. P. DUPONT. Rev. Ph., XLII, IO, PP. 297-324. It is possible to establish logic upon the basis of phenomenalism and the most pronounced subjectivism. For such a system there will be three degrees of certainty of knowledge: (I) that of phenomena given in sensation; (2) that of determinate scientific foreknowledge, of which the methodological prin- ciples are verified by past experience; (3) that of foreknowledge arrived at without such experientially confirmed rules of procedure. Scientific method is based on two fundamental inductive postulates: (I) that there are phenomena indissolubly connected in a determinate relation; (2) that there is an indis- soluble connection between two phenomena when inductive methods furnish no proof to contradict it. Any scientific law, or fact derived from such a law, has only such validity as these two postulates possess. These laws, as expres- sions of universal relations, are judgments. Each application of one of them to a particular case is likewise a judgment. Each judgment is the subsump- tion of concepts or objects of one class under those of another class. Thus the operations of these laws will proceed on the basis of deductive principles of classification. (I) When a multiplicity of objects is divided into two classes, each object is placed in one or the other, and will remain there under the exis- ting conditions. (2) When an object, or class, A, belongs to a class, a, and this class, a, belongs to a class, a', then the first object, or class, A, will also belong to this class, a'. The syllogism is an operation of these principles, and its conclusions will contain the residue of scientific doubt inherent in this method, provided it be more than the mere application of a law to a particular case under that law. The conclusion of a geometrical proposition is not merely an application of one law to a particular case, but of several, and necessitates a definite order of combination in order to achieve the desired result. The rules of formal deductive logic are the different applications of these two principles, in which concepts, propositions, and syllogisms are properly related and classi- fied. These postulates and principles have thus been applied and tested in past experience, but they must also be justified as adequate for future pro- cedure as well. This justification can come only through the uniform verifica- tion by experience of results previously deduced from their operation. Science can thus reduce philosophical doubt to a minimum through the unity of the whole, whereby the entire weight of verification will come to bear on the smallest possible number of fundamental postulates. Such a science will prove its value by the richness and precision of its results. Every scientific hypothesis which is verified in experience will confirm all science, since all science rests on the same two inductive postulates and their applications. The accumulated evidence of centuries of scientific research establishes the validity of the procedure adopted in this research. Scientific laws are only ideally precise, and inability to apply them with quantitative exactness in experience does not detract from their value. That the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles is true, although this can never be exactly verified in experience. The connection which can be affirmed as existing between two phenomena is never rigid, at least it can not be affirmed as such. A. M. TOMFOHRDE.</page><page sequence="6">2i8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. Psychologie et logique de Destutt de Tracy. R. LENOIR. Rev. Ph., XLII, 12, PP. 527-556. During the latter half of the eighteenth century the revolution in science produced a great revolution in the thought of Europe. Among thinkers who believed in the possibility of a science of ideas and who at the same time had greater confidence in the objective value of science than the Criticists of Ger- many, the movement took the form of an attempt to establish by means of a more or less empirical analysis of knowledge a psychology of the intelligence and a new basis for logic. The tendency found its most complete expression in Destutt de Tracy. Trained in the Cartesianism of the Port-Royalists, de Tracy was also deeply influenced by Condillac and in lesser degree by the methods of La Place in astronomy and by the physiological studies of Cabanis and Pinel. The task he set himself was to develop an 'ideology' or science of ideas by analyzing thought as far as possible into its simple sensational ele- ments. Judgment to him was the faculty of perceiving relations between per- ceptions and ideas and of analyzing and combining them. It was a unique intellectual operation originating in bodily movement. Judgment was not subordinated to awareness of bodily activity, however, for these movements might be unperceived and relations might be established automatically. We pass many judgments without being aware that we have made them. A judg- ment of the difference between two ideas means that we feel an idea and feel in this idea the fact of its being different from another. By connecting judg- ment with the organism, analysis discovers logical diversity among minds. Judgment is analytic, comprehensive, existential and affirmative. If to judge is to feel a relation, it is a positive thing; for what could it be to feel a relation which did not exist? Aristotle's fundamental error was the belief that in general ideas lay the principles of all knowledge, whereas particular ideas are the source of knowledge. Logic cannot do its thinking independently of psychological reality. De Tracy interpreted Descartes's first truth in the sense: We are because we feel, or we think because we have perceptions. His theory rests on a preestablished harmony between reality and our chain of ideas, guaranteed by our certainty of our own perceptions and by the com- mon-sense belief that pure sensations are the same for everyone. Error in reasoning arises through the mobility of thought. The mutations of ideas make exact correspondence between memories and present perceptions im- possible. De Tracy did not himself see that he had reduced logic to a chapter in psychology; and that in his theory of judgment he had evolved a new theory of truth, making it subjective and practical, and implying the relativity of all science. He recognized the complexity and fusion of conscious processes, indicated the role which motor elements play in conscious activity, and pointed out the fact of the unconscious. He analyzed what we now call attitudes of mind, and his theory of judgment is in close accord with some of the most recent work on that subject. MARIE T. COLLINS.</page><page sequence="7">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 2I9 De la necessity d'une reforme dans lenseignement de la logique. L. ROUGIER. Rev. de Met., XXIV, 5, pp. 569-594. Logic is defined as the study of the processes employed by the human mind in seeking truth. Truth may consist in the agreement of our thoughts among themselves (formal truth), or in the agreement of our thoughts with the facts which they represent (empirical, intuitive truth). To these two kinds of truth correspond the two kinds of logic: formal deductive logic and practical induc- tive logic. Formal logic concerns itself with guaranteeing the coherence of our judgments among themselves without regard to their empirical verity; it requires of its objects only logical existence or non-contradiction. Given a certain number of notions and non-contradictory propositions, formal logic undertakes to deduce from them new notions involving necessary existence and new propositions necessarily true, provided that the first notions and first propositions be supposed true. Inductive logic concerns itself with establish- ing agreement between the material of our judgments and the facts on which they bear. It may be described as the study of laws or rules which enable us to make predictions which can later be tested by ex- perience. Corresponding to these two sorts of truth are the two kinds of sciences: formal sciences and sciences of nature. The object as studied in the formal sciences is the product of a free creation of the scientific mind, which posits by convention a system of non-contradictory notions and first propositions, and deduces from these by means of rules of formal logic an unlimited sequence of new notions and propositions. Although this choice of a system of indefinable first propositions is said to be conventional, by this is not meant that it is arbitrary. It is conventional only in the sense that there may be an infinity of equivalent systems to solicit the scientist's attention. The object studied by the natural sciences exists prior to the mind of the scientist, imposes itself from without, and to it the scientist must submit passively. This paper deals with formal logic. M. Rowgier is contending mainly against certain Aristotelian idola fori noticeable in the logic taught in the schools. These errors are due for the most part to an identification of reasoning with the syllogism. The consequences of this mistake are that, since the syllogism only goes from the general to the particular, mathematical demonstrations (which almost always go from the general to the general or from the specific to the general) have to be explained by extra-logical processes, such as intuitive apprehension through simple inspection of the figures or through such operations as reversal, rotation and translation. For any adequate logic whatever, alongside deductive reasoning, we must imagine an inverse inductive reasoning, going from the particular to the general, and also reasoning by analogy, which goes from particular to particular. The erroneous identification of reasoning with the syllogism has given rise to false ideas of deduction, of demonstration, of the practical appli- cation of mathematics and the distinctions between the natural and the formal sciences. Alongside the syllogism other elementary types of inference must be reestablished; along with the logic of classes and propositions must come the</page><page sequence="8">220 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. logic of relations; along with the nominal definitions by genus and specific dif- ference, other types of definitions, either explicit or implicit, of classes, relations or of functions. Since reasoning does not proceed exclusively from the gen- eral to the particular, we can recognize that the Baconian induction is a genuinely hypothetical generalization from a single empirical or intuitive in- stance. In reasoning by analogy we can admit an association of ideas through resemblance or a syllogism from a synthetic major premise. Furthermore, the opposition between reasoning and demonstration will be done away with, and it will become possible to reconcile the necessity of the theorem established with the fact of novelty and general acceptance. MARIE T. COLLINS. Pour le progress de la mectaphysique. CHARLES DUNAN. Rev. de Met., XXIV, 5, pp. 489-5 I 5. Philosophy seeks the ultimate unity of all things. Neither common sense nor science can take its place, for both of these lack the one system, the con- sistency, and unity that philosophy requires. Common sense and science are means of adaptation of man to his environment; but philosophy does not seek means of adaptation, it seeks to understand; it seeks the absolute. The Greek philosophers had established a true foundation for philosophy, but the first centuries of Christianity lost the Greek spirit, and with it the Greek temper of philosophy. In its place arose, first mysticism, then the rule of common sense, and in the present era the dominance of science. Modern philosophy has no true metaphysics; it has left metaphysics for science. But we must have a metaphysics to serve as a basis for morality, and as a key to the essence of nature. The apparent metaphysics that we now have, though highly re- spected, is not believed. It cannot be believed, for the different systems are individual creations of individual minds. Since there is only one 'nature' there can be only one metaphysics. The system that we are seeking cannot be manufactured; it must be found, and found only in nature. We must, there- fore, go to experience. However, the experience that metaphysics is based upon is totally different from that upon which science rests. The experience upon which metaphysics is based is that of perception, reflection, the formation of opinions, and their correction by further experience. A number of thinkers experimenting with this method as applied to the same problems, should one day establish certain fundamental principles upon which all would agree. Such an agreement would have power and truth. This was the method of the Greek philosophers, and through it they discovered a great part of metaphysics. Metaphysics is the science of 'being,' and can be the result only of thought; i. e., it must be a priori. To discover the true metaphysics we must have a clear conception of 'reason,'-something different from mere 'understanding,' with which we have confused it. Undertanding may serve the purposes of science, for science deals only with existence, i. e., with the world of phe- nomena. Metaphysics deals with being, and'being is the idea of the absolute who thinks it. Kant had pretended that nature posited a number of problems</page><page sequence="9">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 22I transcending reason, and he threw them into the pit of unknowables. Such a di- vision of nature, however, is not possible. Nature is one, everywhere harmo- nious with itself. Reason is not one of the elements of nature; it is nature itself in its noumenal being. It is then an incontestable truth that all is rational; that the reason of things and the things themselves proceed from a universal and absolute reason. This reason created all natural beings, but manifests itself only in man. Since reason can function in us only through body, it is limited and imperfect in its results. Yet there is no mystery hidden from the eyes of man that is not penetrable, for reason is always with us. We should endeavor to see more clearly and to come into a closer and closer communion with absolute truth. JULIUS COHEN. The Meaning of " The Universe" (2). C. E. HOOPER. Mind, N. S., XXIV, I03, PP. 273-290. In the first part of this paper, which appeared in the April number of Mind, 'the Universe' was defined as meaning "the totality of real thought-objects considered under four related aspects ": Space, Time, Natural Characters, and Natural Causation. This concluding part of the article deals with the finite, separable contents of the universe. These contents are classified as of eight kinds: entities, materials, events, processes, features, qualities, magnitudes and actual relations. While all may be denominated contents of the universe (under the aspect of Natural Characters), only the entities may be said to form true constituents (under the aspects of Space, Time, and Cause). En- tities possess qualities of their own, enter into relations, and by and through them all, processes and events take place. There is no genuine logical incon- sistency between the view expressed in the first part of this paper, i. e., that the universe is a necessary unity of various complementary modes related to human thought, and the view expressed in the latter part, i. e., that the uni- verse is "a collective unity of relatively enduring, integrating and disinte- grating things." While it is legitimate to contemplate the universe through combining the data of the natural sciences, no new knowledge in these fields can invalidate the world of changing, concrete things. There is, however, an inevitable conflict of sentiments and values according as we regard the universe abstractly as a group of eternal types and modes or as a group of relatively transient individuals. The position here maintained is broadly monistic, though compatible with a relational dualism. It attempts to show a double duality in the universe through the aspects of Space and Time being joined to those of Character and Causation. Human reason exercises its proper func- tion in perceiving these distinctions and further in discriminating with regard to what is logically consistent, scientifically true, ethically, politically, aes- thetically and practically valuable. The question as to whether man will ever be able to trace a great orthogenic principle or soul in the universe remains unanswered. MARIE T. COLLINS.</page><page sequence="10">222 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. Luther's Place in Modern Theology. JOHN WRIGHT BUCKHAM. American Journal of Theology, XXI, 4, PP. 485-5II. Luther was a theologian as well as a hero and a reformer. As a theologian he was fully equipped, having a knowledge of Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and being conversant with the Fathers, especially Augustine. Although he had some appreciation of scholasticism, he was blind to what was best in it; Aristotle was to him only a blind heathen, and he knew little of Aquinas. He left no closed system of theology; his thought was outspoken, open-hearted, free and incon- sistent. The fundamental feature of Luther's theological thought was its Christo-centric character. In this it contrasts with Calvinism on the one hand and Catholicism on the other. The doctrine of justification by faith has too often been understood in a formal way. Luther desired relief from the bur- den of sin, some one to whom to turn for peace of mind and redeeming strength, and these he found in Jesus Christ. " True faith," said Luther, " is a sure trust and confidence in the heart, and a firm consent whereby Christ is apprehended." Christ was to Luther much what he was to Paul. Luther's relation to Christ contained a deep element of mysticism. Thus he teaches that by faith the soul is united to Christ as the bride to the bridegroom. By this mystery Christ and the soul become one flesh. His doctrine of justification by faith seems to have arisen from his mystical experience of Christ. The bond be- tween persons, although the most unquestionable of all things, is by its very nature mystical, too deep and real to be fully understood. Luther's mystical relation to Christ was of this sort. This bond between the individual and Christ he called faith, and its effect, justification. These are symbols of a reality too great for formulation. Another fundamental characteristic of Luther's theology is its experimental character, its basis in experience. This was the basis of his estimate of the Bible; he saw the intrinsic superiority and inner splendor of the Bible. Since he was guided by a sense of value he treated certain books of the Bible with a degree of freedom. His theology was also marked by ethical integrity. Faith was for him the first and highest good work. This was not because he disparaged conduct but because he wished to get at the inner motive which lies behind conduct. A weaker side of his thought was his supernaturalism and his belief in the devil. He also held to the doctrine of a corrupt and depraved human nature. He was a thorough- going determinist and likened the will to an ass: "The human will is like a beast of burden. If God mounts it, it wishes and goes as he will; if Satan mounts it, it wishes and goes as he will. Nor can it choose the rider it would prefer, nor betake itself to him, but it is the riders who contend for its posses- sion." Luther's thinking was also limited by his individualism. His greatest insight was his recognition of the power of the gospel to hallow and transform life in all its instincts and activities; that is, that the mission of faith in Christ is to release and to reconstruct human life. The new conception of faith in Christ which we find in Luther means the death of dogma, the universalizing of Christianity, and a reunited Church whose foundation will be Christian experience centering in Christ.

Bacon is "the exponent and the prophet of the modern spirit." In the con- cept of 'modern' we include the ideas "of progress, of control, of utility and of responsibility." Bacon has pointed out the necessity of turning from the con- sideration of the ideas of antiquity, especially the Platonic conception of the world as static, to the attempt to make progress through discovery. He has shown that this progress should be given direction through method. Whatever we say about Bacon's use of the inductive method matters little, for his im- portant contribution was the insistence on methodological control, on control by mind. He has indicated that this mental control should so direct progress that it would operate for human welfare. He has made clear that the ability for such control imposes on us great responsibility which we cannot shift. Man's duty is to use his mind for the advancement of what is worth while. MARJORIE S. HARRIS. Laphilosophiefran~aiseenAmerique. W. RILEY. Rev.Ph.,XLII,pp.393-428. The influence of French philosophy in America may be described by applying Comte's law of the three stages. In the first stage, the theological stage, repre- sented by the Puritans, the French influence was that of Voltaire, and was destructive in effect. In the metaphysical stage, the period of transcenden- talism and deism, the French influences were Cousin, Constant and Jouffroy. The positivistic period shows the less definite influence of Comte. The Dictionnaire of Voltaire was influential although it was proscribed by the colleges. Many other French thinkers had an important influence, e. g., Buffon, whose Epoques de la nature nourished the thought of American Deists; Cabanis, whose materialism affected Jefferson; Condorcet, whose Progres de l'esprit humain was printed in Maryland; and Volney, whose Ruines ou Revo- lutions des Empires excited much popular interest. French naturalism gave -way to spiritualism and transcendentalism, however, under the influence of Maine de Biran and Cousin, and these new influences were felt in America. Cousin was important in introducing German idealism into America, and thus contributed to the transcendentalist movement. Transcendentalism was a reaction against the teachings of Locke and the Scotch school. Cousin's doctrine of an immediate rational intuition of the divine was congenial to the transcendentalists. The eclectic system met with opposition on all sides, but was defended by Caleb Henry and George Ripley. It was severely criticised by Francis Bowen. Emerson studied Cousin, but was not greatly impressed by him, finding him too systematic. Eclecticism was unpopular because the Americans were men of parties and despised 'mugwumps.' W.
