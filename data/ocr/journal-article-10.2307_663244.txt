<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology of Santa Marta, Colombia. The Tairona Culture. Part II, Section 2: Objects of Pottery. J. ALDEN MASON.With an appendix on ceramic technology by Donald Horton. (Anthropological Series, Field Museum of Natural History, Volume XX, Number 3, pp. 275-418. Chicago, 1939.) Dr Mason concludes his description of archaeological materials from the Santa Marta region with this section of the objects of pottery. Most of the material con- sidered was collected for the Field Museum by the author, but a survey was made of all known archaeological objects from this region in other collections in order to make the report as comprehensive as possible. The pottery complex is described as a chronological unit since no stratigraphic excavation has been undertaken and there is no apparent seriation or other suggestion of the presence of different horizons. Nearly all of the vessels described fall into two types, red ware and black ware. The red ware has a coarse paste and the shapes tend to be large and relatively simple. The black vessels are smaller with a paste of fine texture. More complex and varied forms are included in the latter ware, among them the characteristic ollas with annular bases and flying birds in relief decorating the shoulders.

Annular bases predominate with round bottomed forms also present; the round bases are more common in the red ware. Tetrapods and effigies occur only in the black ware, while the few shoe-shaped vessels noted are restricted to the red. Both wares were used extensively for mortuary purposes. Painted pottery is known from one site only and eight of the nine examples are from one grave. It is regarded as an importation. Ocarinas are plentiful and characteristic. Many of them are impressive from an artistic standpoint, particularly the anthropomorphic types with elaborate head-dresses. Small and beautifully carved effigy vessels resting on a four-legged bench are also distinctive. Figurines, spindle whorls, and tripod supports are either absent or extremely rare. The technological analysis by Donald Horton supports the megascopic obser- vations in most cases. The black and red types are classified as local wares. The fine-textured black type lacks any aplastic admixture, while the coarser red wart is tempered with sand. The painted pottery does not differ materially from the black local pottery but analysis of a similar painted sherd from outside of the Tairona area shows that its compostion is almost identical and may indicate a possible source for the Santa Marta specimens. Other aberrant sherds proved to be markedly different from the local wares in composition and texture. Conclusions and comparisons are reserved for Part III of the series, not yet published. The location of the region close to the Isthmus at the end of the High- lands should make the synthesis of exceptional interest. From a descriptive point of view the publication is very satisfactory. The unusually complete analysis and full illustration will be valuable for comparative study. Detailed reports of this quality from strategic areas are perhaps the most important need of South American archaeology at the present time. ALBERT C. SPAULDING COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
