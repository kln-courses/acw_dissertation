PATRONS OF SHAMAN IC POWER La Venta's supernatural entities in light of Mixe beliefs Carolyn E. Tate Department of Art, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX 79409-2081, USA Abstract This article takes two new approaches to the "enigmas" of La Venta. First, it examines the form of the site in relation to the region from which the La Ventans procured their stone: primarily, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. La Venta's north-south axis pointed to the nearest high mountain south of the site. The bar-and-four-dots design on the Mosaic Pavements corresponded to the duality of the female earth and its four-directional maize plants crossed by the east-west path of the male sun. The Massive Offerings, previously interpreted as effigies of seas, are noted to be on the north of the ceremonial court and to correspond to the ocean a few kilometers north of the site. Second, this paper augments the current understanding of the ideological or spiritual motivations for the design and construction of La Venta's Massive Offerings and Mosaic Pavements by looking through the lens of contemporary Mixe ritual practice and shamanic cosmology. The Mixe are probably the linguistic descendants of the Gulf Coast Olmecs. Using these two lines of analysis, the paper advances several related proposals. It argues that the La Ventans planned Complexes A and C (the designations for the ceremonial court containing the Massive Offerings and other deposits and for the big mound) to replicate the topography of the region important to La Venta as a source of materials and food and, by extension, of knowledge. It specifically correlates the Massive Offerings, Mosaic Pavements, and almond-eyed supernaturals on stelae at the foot of Mound C to the principal "supernatural reality configurations" of the contemporary Mixe. Furthermore, it contextualizes the problem of shamanism by arguing that these supernaturals were not "gods" but sources of shamanic power and that the many buried offerings at La Venta are best seen as similar to aspects of Mixe ritual, which they call "work of the earth." Finally, the paper reconsiders the existence of "gods" among the Olmecs, concluding that a more appropriate way to express their notions of the sacred is that they conceived supernaturals as meta-cosmological or meta-meteorological forces. WHY IS LA VENTA STILL SO ENIGMATIC? In a popular book, America's First Civilization, of 1968, Michael Coe remarked: Digging below the surface of an adobe platform, the 1955 ex pedition found one of the three pavement masks of La Venta. Each mask is a stylized face of the Olmec were-jaguar made up of nearly 500 blocks of serpentine. For all the artistry and labor that went into them, the masks were buried almost immediately after completion. Why, no one knows. The feats of constructing La Venta have intrigued scholars since Frans Blom and Oliver La Farge reported the site in 1926 (Blom and La Farge 1926). About 900 B.C., the La Ventans literally moved mountains. The site's makers hauled and piled many baskets of earth to make a mound that today measures about 30 in high (Fig ure 1). From about 128 km away, they hauled huge basalt boul ders, from which to carve colossal heads, and nearly 100 other sculptures. Most of these depict men claiming supernatural author ity or negotiating political networks. Some of the most unusual features of La Venta lay buried in large pits, one of which was 19 X 20 m wide and nearly 4 m deep. In the pits resided cut ser pentine blocks carried from a mountain on the other side of the continent (Williams and Heizer 1965). Their modern discoverers called these deposits of serpentine "Massive Offerings" (Figure 2) and determined that about every hundred years, as a preliminary act to each major construction phase, the La Ventans created such a deposit (Drucker 1955:125). Above three of the Massive Offer ings, the La Ventans laid an uppermost layer of blocks to form a large north-south bar flanked by two elements each on the east and west sides and a larger one, with the same sideways-E shape, on the north. Archaeologists called these designs "Mosaic Pave ments" and "were-jaguar masks," as in the quotation above. After their burial, packed in layers of multicolored clays and accompa nied by skillfully crafted stone celts and mirrors, the Massive Of ferings and Mosaic Pavements were never seen but only known to exist. In fact, as complements to the earth forms and stone mon uments that were visible to all, the La Ventans devoted equal labor to obtaining and crafting the components of the ceremonial city that they concealed. Clearly, a powerful ideology motivated the construction of the big mound and a Massive Offering in each of the ceremonial court's four phases. While the shape of each Massive Offering is distinct, each consisted of a broad, deep array of green blocks situated un der or adjacent to other skillfully crafted objects, especially celts. Such a pattern suggests a high degree of consistency in conceptual intent for over approximately 500 years. This ideology, underly ing these and other La Venta sculptures, has remained elusive de spite many advances in the study of La Venta's economic and subsistence bases (Rust and Sharer 1988), its temporal position in 169</page><page sequence="2">170 Tate Figure I.

La Venta's Massive Offerings. Drawing by Richard Cavallin-Cosma, 1997 (after Drucker et al. 1959], the span of Olmec cultures (mostly 800-400 B.C.; Rust and Ley den 1994), and multifaceted data gathered from excavations (Drucker 1952; Druckeretal. 1959; González Lauck 1988, 1989, 1994, 1996; Heizer, Drucker, and Graham 1968; Heizer, Graham, andNapton 1968; Pina Chán 1982). Despite the acknowledged im portance of La Venta as an example of early ceremonial city plan ning, as one of the few places in which a wide variety of portable sculpture has been found in situ, and for its unusual Massive Of ferings, no study has contextualized La Venta's two- and three dimensional symbol systems relative to an ethnology of the Gulf Coast Olmec's linguistic descendants. Also, although it has been known that the La Ventans procured the stones from a wide ranging region, primarily to the south and west, where the visible mountains reside, no one has compared the design of Complex A to the topography of this region. This paper addresses La Venta's more "enigmatic" features by pursuing these two new lines of analysis. It advances several re lated proposals. It argues that the La Ventans planned Complexes A and C (the designations for the ceremonial court containing the Massive Offerings and other deposits and for the big mound) to replicate the topography of the region important to La Venta as a source of materials and food and, by extension, of knowledge. It specifically correlates the Massive Offerings, Mosaic Pavements, and almond-eyed supernaturals on stelae at the foot of Mound C to the principal "supernatural reality configurations" of the con temporary Mixe, probable linguistic descendants of the Olmecs. Furthermore, it contextualizes the problem of shamanism by ar guing that these supernaturals were not "gods" but sources of sha manic power and that the many buried offerings at La Venta are best seen as similar to aspects of Mixe ritual, which they call "work of the earth." Although these interpretations build on the previous work of several scholars, I do not follow the custom of critically evaluating that work at the outset because I wish to present these new lines of evidence on a relatively clean slate. After doing this, however, the paper will turn to a reconsideration of the existence of "gods" among the Olmecs. Since I anticipate considerable resistance to the use of twentieth century Mixe beliefs as an analogy to their ancestors, I defend this approach with a caveat about the nature of interpretation. Even when their subject is as contiguous as the nineteenth century, his torians acknowledge the "obstinate otherness of the past" (Schama 1998). As historian Simon Schama (1998:40) pointed out, "All his tory is a negotiation between familiarity and strangeness," be tween reason and imagination. Any effort to rationalize the unfamiliar activities of prehistoric peoples obviously employs a great deal of imaginative reading-between-the-lines of modern ar chaeological description and of being cognizant of patterns in the built environment where they are not expected. The art historical interpretations this paper advances cannot be conclusively proven. They rest in my assumptions regarding the prevalent ideology of Middle Formative "Olmec" peoples. My predilection allows for ideology and for spiritual pursuits as possible concerns for at least some individuals, while not discounting that many were likely driven by the desires to obtain wealth and manipulate people and circumstances. By and large, however, the pervasiveness of shamanic cosmological constructions in Middle Formative Meso america suggests that people accepted some variation of the magic cosmic worldview that usually accompanies the cosmology of a</page><page sequence="4">172 Tate Roca Partida sT I •-OtT Cerro El Vigfa ,N n A » citics &gt;'&lt; sites A sources of stone l I . 0 kilometers 80 _ Chinameca ▲ / m / ILa Venta Arroyo Pesquero San Lorenzo • Villahermosa Figure 3.

For the La Venta people, the physical world pos sessed animate spirits in its topographical and meteorological fea tures as well as in plants and animals. Negotiation with these spirits at times demanded an expert, a person who knew them first-hand through mystical journeys, a shaman. This paper attempts to en liven the mute offerings placed by the La Ventans with the sha manic practices of their distant descendants, the Mixe. I hope such an effort may be considered a respectful poetic narrative that elu cidates some very powerful, very ancient visual forms. LA VENTA AS A MODEL OF THE ISTHMUS Geographically, La Venta occupies a long, narrow salt dome amid freshwater swampland and lies between two rivers near the Bay of Campeche (Figure 3). This high ground seems to have been se lected for its north-south extent, because an axis oriented 8° west of north dominated the placement and shape of most visible struc tures of La Venta as well as the offerings buried deep under the surface below many layers of carefully sorted colored clays (Fig ure 4). In the ceremonial court (Complex A), visible constructions were located symmetrically around this axis, as were many hidden ones. Thus, one artistic principle governing the site's design was bilateral symmetry, above and below ground. Rare in most art, sym metry usually represents the stable nature of the sacred, as in a mandala or a seated pharaoh. Among the Maya, frontal (symmet rical) representations occur only as faces of various supernatural powers, such as the witz, or sacred ancestral mountain, and among the Aztec, frontal (symmetrical) imagery "is reserved in Postclas sic two-dimensional imagery for those deities who are related to the female earth goddess Tlaltecuhtli " (Klein 1977:172). Only Complexes A and C exhibit symmetry at La Venta, although the other platforms conform to the established orientation. The three colossal heads just north of Complex A along the axis enhance the axial symmetry, as do three large sculptures on or near the axis in the vicinity of Structure D-7 at the southern end of the main area of the site (González Lauck 1996).1 Thus, the central axis and the symmetry created around it, in Complexes A and C, suggest, as most archaeologists have suspected, that this is the sacred, or cer emonial, area of the site. A possible correlation between, the cer 1 In a recent paper, Tate and Bendersky (1999) identified these as mon umental fetus effigies.</page><page sequence="5">Patrons of shamanic power 173 Colossal Heads o o o Massive Offerings = MO ^ Mosaic Pavements = MP Mound A-2 /' MO Ph2 MO Ph2 MO Ph4 MO I'll* Figure 4.

Ph, phases as signed in Drucker et al. (1959:121-125). emonial court and a female earth supernatural will be explored further below. Many people have wondered how the La Ventans selected the orientation of 8° west of north. A recent interpretation of this roughly north-south axis considers possible astronomical observations among the people of La Venta, specifically that the Milky Way arches north to south over La Venta on the night of the second annual solar zenith passage in the tropics, August 13 at La Venta's latitude. Freidel and Scheie showed that the ancient Maya viewed the movements of the Milky Way and certain constellations on that night as a sort of annual celestial dramatic performance of the creation of the cosmos and chose this night in 3114 B.C. as the beginning the present creation. At dawn, the constellation the Maya call the "Three Stones of Creation," which we see as part of Orion, appeared at its zenith. These "Three Stones of Creation" may be represented by the three Massive Offerings under La Venta's cer emonial court. According to this theory, the north-south axis marks La Venta as the Place of Creation each August 13 (Freidel et al. 1993:97; Reilly 1994b). A problem with Freidel and Scheie's hy pothesis is that it is synchronic. The Massive Offerings were not built as a set of three, although the La Ventans may have placed Massive Offering 3 (the 19- X 20- X 2-m layer offering under the north end of the sunken court) at the inception of Phase III to cre ate a triadic arrangement with those deposited under the southeast and southwest platforms at the inception of Phase II (Drucker et al. 1959:125). Also, since the Milky Way's orientation changes con stantly as observed from earth, this is a fairly arbitrary correspon dence. Peoples throughout the world, however, have used celestial archetypes, frequently associated with male sky deities, in design ing ceremonial cities (Eliade 1959:6-11). Perhaps a terrestrial fea ture specified the precise orientation of the axis as 8° west of north. Almost 100 km to the south, but clearly visible from Mound C, rises a 1,219-m-high mountain, at 17°14" north and just east of the 94th meridian in the foothills of the Sierra Madre del Sur. La Venta is just west of the same meridian. The site's central axis definitely points to this peak. This alluring mountain was certainly known to the La Ventans, because they imported some metamorphic rocks from this region (Williams and Heizer 1965). Possibly, Mound C, at the south of the ceremonial court, replicates this very mountain to the south of the site. Located on the Tabasco-Chiapas-Oaxaca border, this area is not well known today. Curiously, most maps of the Gulf Coast Olmec region situate La Venta at the eastern ex treme of the graphic, omitting the area south of the site. La Venta's north-south axis points our attention to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a region with which the La Ventans, definitely, were familiar (Figure 3). I propose that Complexes A and C con ceptually replicate the Isthmus. The La Ventans explored the plains and mountains to the south and brought back significant portions of the landscape. Journeying through these regions posed formi dable challenges to the La Ventans in terms of negotiating with its inhabitants (human and supernatural) and of physically accumu lating hundreds of tons of imported stone. As Mary Helms (1993) has shown, travel and the acquisition of stone functioned as skills similar to or even more important than crafting of stone sculptures in many ancient societies. La Ventans accumulated stone for mon umental and portable sculpture from a significantly larger region and from farther south than did the people of San Lorenzo or other Gulf Coast Olmec cities. Allowing that reciprocal trade relation ships existed among the La Ventans and other Isthmian groups, who may have been Mixe-Zoquean speakers, as suggested by Lowe et al. (1982), does not explain why the La Ventans felt compelled to import great quantities of stone from distant places for depos iting in a sacred court. As they explored the physical space and the cultural cognitive realms of the Isthmus, they imitated, on a small scale, the topography of their known world. This idea builds on Kent Reilly's (1994b:204-213) suggestion that if Complex C, the mound, represented a mountain or volcano, as proposed by Robert Heizer (1968:20), then the La Venta archi tects completed a conceptual cosmogram by digging huge pits for the deposition of green serpentine blocks (the Massive Offerings) that represented the waters of the Underworld. (The mound likely represented a mountain despite Rebecca González Lauck's</page><page sequence="6">174 Tate EREMONIAL COURT LA VENTA. DETAIL OF THE SOUTH-EAST with MASSIVE OFFERING Figure 5.

[1990:51] confirmation that it was, in fact, a stepped pyramid, be cause of the shamanic notion that pyramids are effigies of moun tains.) I concur with Reilly but add that the mountain and sea effigies also reflect the specific topography of the region with which the people of La Venta negotiated as they obtained the materials used to build their ceremonial center as a ritual diagram of the vertical and horizontal known worlds. About 6 miles to the north of the site, and visible from the summit of Mound C, lies the Gulf of Mexico, where the watery underworld intersects the realm of hu mans. To the south, the first major peak (1,243 m) is approxi mately 100 km away and along a continuation of La Venta's central axis. The active volcano, El Chichón, or La Union, approximately 1,615 m high, rises about 122 km to the southeast of La Venta. Another peak, nearly the same height as El Chichón, is about the same distance to the southwest, such that the three form a triangle of visible mountains. The three Mosaic Pavements also form a sub terranean triangle in Complex A. Also visible after rainfall and in the atmospherically clearer months of December and January is the range of 20 peaks, Cerro Zempoaltepec, that forms part of the current Mixe homeland. Metamorphic rocks, such as schists, andes ites, and diorites, used for some monumental sculptures came from these visible mountains. The serpentines used to create the Mas sive Offerings and Mosaic Pavements are thought to originate from the flanks of the highest mountain on the Isthmus, the 2,621-m peak near Niltepec (Williams and Heizer 1965:12), which was not visible from La Venta. Stones used at La Venta were assembled from a vast region: from Roca Partida on the northwest and Cerro Cintepec in the west; from the mountain range near Niltepec, 225 km across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the south; and from Vol cano El Chichón in the east (Williams and Heizer 1965:12). The built environment of La Venta demonstrates the inhabitants' intimate knowledge of face of this terrain. In this way, the construction of the prominent Mound C and the hidden Massive Offerings and Mosaic Pavements in Complex A create a dialogue with celestial (some times invisible) and terrestrial (sometimes invisible) archetypes. Furthermore, the much-debated "bar-and-four-dots" design, the central component of the Mosaic Pavements, forms another aspect of this Isthmian diagram. It provides a buried indicator of the visi ble axis (Figure 5). As La Ventans oriented the three mosaic pave ments, their central bars precisely parallel the north-south orientation of the city. The four elements, or dots, surrounding the central bar are distributed at the intercardinal points, or where the sun rises and sets on the solstices. Many Mesoamerican peoples2 organize space by the solstitial sunrise and set points on the horizon,3 as do the Mixe, 2 The ancient Maya; certain Olmec groups such as the people atTeopan tecuanitlan who spoke Otomanguean languages, as did the Zapotees of Oaxaca; and the contemporary Maya and Mixe all organize space accord ing to solsticial rise and set points. 3 Elsie Parsons (1936) suggested that the bar-and-four-dots repre sented the world quarters or four corners of the earth. I modify her obser vation by referring specifically to the solsticial sunrise and set points, marked by the Olmec at other sites, such as by the monoliths at Teopantecuani tlan's sunken court (Martínez Donjuán 1995).</page><page sequence="7">Patrons of shamanic power 175 ^ [w.

Examples of bar-and-four dots designs: [a] celts from La Venta Offering 1942-C; [b] "rollout" of de sign from a cylinder vessel from House 16, Area B, San Jose Mogote (after Mar cus 1989:173]. who associate these points with the "corners" of the earth, and the cardinal directions that alternate with them relate to unvarying lo cations in time and space (Lipp 1991:30). Several authors have investigated the bar-and-four-dots motif with different, yet related, results (Figure 6). Based on its juxta position with some "were-jaguar" images, Coe (1965:757-762) saw it as the stylized version of the "were-jaguar" face. Elizabeth Ben son (1971:29) proposed that it functioned as a place sign for La Venta. To David Joralemon (1976:45-52), it represented God I, the "Olmec Dragon," which signified the earth and its fertility. To better understand how it worked at La Venta, it is helpful to ex amine how it functioned at another site. This design decorated ce ramic vessels at the Zapotee site of San José Mogote, where its use preceded La Venta's pavements by several hundred years. There, the bar-and-four-dots motif surrounded by clefts is one of several designs interpreted as representing the earth. It was found exclu sively in the north quadrant of the site; the south quadrant was unexcavated. Burials in the east and west quadrants of the site con tained pottery decorated predominantly with a so-called fire serpent, or avian supernatural, interpreted as representing the sky (Marcus 1989:169-173; Pyne 1976). As at La Venta, the bar-and four-dots "earth" motif correlated with the north and south direc tions. The avian or "sky" design at San José Mogote compares to the four "dots" in the Mosaic Pavement designs, which indicate solstitial rising and setting extremes and, by extension, the celes tial path of the sun across the sky. These configurations suggest that both groups conceived of the north-south directions as the terrestrial axis and the east-west as a celestial one, such that, at San José Mogote, the two combine to create a basic cosmogram of the earth surface traversed by the sun. Returning to a consideration of La Venta, Reilly (1994b:204 213) convincingly argued that the Massive Offerings, Mosaic Pave ments, and Mound C diagramed a three-layer shamanic cosmogram. He (1994a passim) observed that the design of the Mosaic Pave ments incorporated three elements (Figure 7). On the north, the double merlon (or sideways-E) symbolized the entrance to the Un derworld. He agreed with Joralemon (1976:52) and Benson (1971:29) that the central bar-and-four-dots referred to the "Olmec Dragon," the symbol of earth and fertility, and to the place of La Venta. Following a suggestion by Rosemary Joyce, Reilly (1994a: 134) proposed that the fringed diamonds on the south of the Mosaic Pavements represented Nymphaea ampia, the water lily. According to Reilly (1994a: 134), the three Mosaic Pavements formed complex symbols for the portal from the terrestrial realm to the underworld. In their location above the Massive Offerings, they functioned as symbols of an animate, fertile La Venta earth. The Maya, according to Reilly, used the water lily-festooned croc odile floating on the watery surface of the underworld to represent the earth. He pointed out that, above each Mosaic Pavement, the La Ventans placed a cruciform cache of celts and a mirror, which created an effigy of the world tree growing from the surface of the watery underworld (Figure 5). Below the Massive Offerings were effigies of the underworld seas, which rested on a foundation of blood (a red cinnabar layer). Together with the mountain effigy (Mound C), these elements symbolized the vertical strata of the shamanic cosmos: the underworld, earth, and sky linked by the world tree. Brian Stross (1994) recently suggested another accretion of meaning for the bar-and-four-dots—that this quincunx stands for the spirits of the developmental phases of maize. In Late Preclas sic and Early Classic Maya iconography, a series of symbols rep resented personifications of four developmental stages of the maize plant: a seed, a sprout, a spike or flower, and the jilote, an im mature but edible ear. Their makers distributed these symbols around a central point or a central image of the ruler as a mature, fruiting maize plant. Stross pointed out that ritual offerings of smoke and drink by shamans occur in a quincunx as the shaman turns to the four directions, and, similarly, the milpa is measured and planted in a quincunx. One of several examples he gave of maize planting came from Tenejapa, a highland Maya commu nity in Mexico, where one begins with a center hole and uses a planting stick (just under 2 m in length) to measure the appro priate distance for four more holes in the corners, resulting in a quincunx created with a bar (Berlin et al. 1974:126). In the Olmec corpus, a quincunx of four maize seeds distributed in four direc tions around a maize plant appeared on a small, light greenish gray, roughly square stone plaque from the Ahuelican vicinity, Guerrero, now in the Dallas Museum of Art (Figure 8). Seen from these multiple perspectives, the bar-and-four-dots in La Ven ta's Mosaic Pavements functioned as the earth (the bar in a north south axis), with holes for planting maize indicated in the foyr directions, which also defined the rising and setting points of the sun and suggested its celestial paths. Stross (1994:28) also noted that Late Preclassic Maya fash ioned two of the sets of maize-cycle symbols as carved jade heads, found in caches at Nohmul and Cerros, arranged in a quincunx</page><page sequence="8">176 Tate cleft / fontanelle / north / access to sea / Higiny bar / surface of earth / La Venta island / Naswin stepped dots / solstitial sunrise and sunset points / holes for maize seed / maize seed fringed diamonds / vegetation Figure 7.

The principal headband represented on Olmec individuals has four seeds, each slightly different, flanking a central element Figure 8. Stone plaque reportedly from Ahuelican, Guerrero [Dallas Mu seum of Art 1968.33], Drawing by Carolyn E. Tate. (Figure 9). Reilly (1994b), Stross (1994), and Karl Taube (1996) proposed that this headband marked the wearer as the axis mundi, related to the maize plant. Stross (1994) and Taube (1996:42) fur ther proposed that the four seeds, distinctly shaped on some im ages, represented four phases of maize growth. Thus, according to a near consensus of contemporary opinion, the headband referred simultaneously to the process of maize germination and develop ment. to the maize plant and headband wearer as the central axis, and to the ritual pattern followed in planting seeds in the four di rections. Another significance for this headband, in the context of Mixe religious belief and ritual, is suggested below. Extending the cosmogram from the vertical to the horizontal dimension, I propose that the Mosaic Pavement design also re ferred to the surface of local earth in the context of the Isthmian topogram developed at La Venta. Immediately to the south of the city were riverine estuaries and swamps choked with water lilies (in Yucatec, ixim ha', or water lily, literally translates as "water maize," indicating an association between maize and waterlilies [Stross 1994]; unfortunately, terms for water lily in proto-Mixe Zoquean are not known). To the north, of course, lies the Gulf of Mexico. The Mosaic Pavements diagramed the local terrain: the north-south site stretching toward the visible sea and mountain and surrounded by water lily-filled swamps, planted with maize and acted upon by the path of the sun. To recapitulate, in each phase of Complex A, La Ventans con structed an effigy of the sea to the north with serpentines from the southernmost, mountainous part of the Isthmus of Tehuante pec. In Phases II and IV, they surfaced the sea effigy with an earth-surface/maize planting and growth/central vertical axis and solstitial directional diagram. Both Massive Offerings and Mo saic Pavements were set in the unusual colored clays local to the area, possibly to provide a "home" for the foreign materials.

These architectural sculptures comprised the triple levels of the general shamanic cosmos and created a diagram of the Isthmian terrain. MIXE SUPERNATURAL REALITY CONFIGURATIONS AND LA VENTA'S ABSTRACT COSMOGRAM In an article that contributed substantially to the approach the fol lowing part of this article takes, Joyce Marcus (1989:149) pointed</page><page sequence="10">178 Tate out that, in reconstructing elements of Formative period "reli gion" (or its ideological symbol system), an analysis should be specific to an area because ideological distinctions existed in the many regions of Mesoamerica and should "associate the occu pants with a culture and language." It is generally accepted that the Gulf Coast Olmecs spoke an ancestral language of the Mixe Zoquean family and not a Mayan language, as had been proposed previously (Campbell and Kaufman 1976). However, questions re main regarding whether Gulf Coast Olmecs spoke languages from the Mixean or Zoquean branch (see Stross 1994:12). Here I ex plore artistic evidence relating La Venta to the Mixean branch. Ap proximately 76,000 speakers of Mixean, a language of the once widespread Mixe-Zoquean language family, live today in the re mote rugged mountains of northeastern Oaxaca, where they mi grated after the Aztecs displaced them. Early populations of Mixe Zoquean speakers probably extended throughout the Isthmus, from the current mountainous homeland to the Izapa area and north to La Venta. Although a number of anthropologists have published studies on the Mixe,4 none has focused on the pre-Hispanic sub strate of their religious and medical practices until the publication of a volume by Frank Lipp (1991), which drew upon ethnographic fieldwork in numerous villages and focused on these cultural do mains considered important by the Mixe themselves. Today, the Mixe practice Roman Catholicism, although they have amalgamated it with indigenous beliefs that were kept alive in their relatively remote region. In contemporary practice, each individ ual "selects and emphasizes particular religious themes of the to tal symbolic complex"(Lipp 1991:24). But ethnographer Lipp drew together accounts from many communities to create a serviceable generalization regarding the indigenous component of religious beliefs. Among the contemporary Mixe, the numinous beings, which Lipp (1991:25) calls "greater-than-human reality configurations," manifest as either male-female pairs or female pairs. Poh 'Ene-, who possesses both male and female characteristics, is considered generally male, embodying the wind and thunder. The most im portant supernatural reality configuration consists of an earth related female dyad called Na-s w i-ñ. Manifestations of human life, growth, seas, lakes, rivers and fishing are related to another female dyad called Higin-y. Yu:k (a male-female pair considered male), a mute anthropomorphic being, functions as owner of the animals. These are the most important of several such beings. The Mixe consider the earth's surface, Na-s w i-ñ, as "all knowing of human affairs and the maternal repository of primor dial wisdom" and call her Mother Earth or, in terms of the 260 day calendar, One World. They associate her with the direction north and the color dark green. She lives and from her issue trees, Figure 10. La Venta Monument 6. Drawing by Carolyn E.

As Lipp (1991:30-31) described her: "The world and all it encompasses—trees, water, forests, mountains—is to the Mixe alive, and since it gives them their entire sustenance, they cannot exist without her." She is the witness of all and speaks only truth, so communications from her are never disputed (Hoogshagen 1966). I propose that Na-s w i-ñ descends from the concept represented in La Venta's Mosaic Pavements (Figure 5). The bar-and-four-dots represented the earth surface as crossed and fertilized by the sun and as the womb of maize vegetation.5 The four "flowers" to the south of the quincunx may also have indicated vegetation, specifically La Venta's swampy plants. The pavements were made of greenstone and were in the north rela tive to the mountain/pyramid. The crocodilian Olmec Dragon, or God I, seems to have been a zoomorphic antecedent to the concept of Na-s w i-ñ (Figure 10). Although only a few "Olmec Dragon" images are conjoined with the bar-and-four-dots design, Joralemon (1976:37) related the two, calling the "Olmec Dragon" a crocodilian associated with earth, water, agricultural fertility, and sprouting vegetation. He assumed the "Dragon" was male. As Reilly (1991:161-162) pointed out, a crocodilian-vegetation complex of imagery is properly on the left side of complex cosmological compositions, such as the Young Lord and the petroglyphs at Chalcatzingo. I was unable to find a source on the Mixe that indicated explicitly whether the Mixe con ceive of gender in relation to self-referential direction. To some degree, gender factors into a division of labor and the use of ritual space. For example, in the cemetery at Ixcatlan, males and fe males are buried on opposing sides. Relative to the point of view of the most important spot or "head" of the cemetery, where the prominent fiscal lies, the females are disposed to his left (Lipp 1991:6). The Mayas of Chamula consider left as the female side of 4 In researching his 1945 monograph on the Mixe, Ralph Beals (1945) attempted to elicit information regarding "pagan" or "non-Catholic" prac tices but apparently met with resistance. He worked primarily in Ayotla, a town where considerable interaction with the Ladino community had oc curred. His chapters on religious beliefs possess the quality of a travelogue to some shrines and ritual performances in the region. Carrasco et al. (1961) documented the persistence and use of the 260-day calendar (in two forms) in four Mixe towns, each of which had experienced varying degrees of interaction with Ladino economic and ideological systems in the period between 1920 and 1955, when the data were gathered. Later, Carrasco (1966) published an article outlining Mixe public ritual performances during the installation of municipal authorities. He situated them in the context of ancestor worship ceremonies and the veneration of the idol embodying the atmospheric phenomena of lightning, rain, and wind. Nahmad's (1965, 1989) work mostly deals with the political, technological, and social issues fac ing the Mixe today. 5 This powerful supernatural reality configuration regulates human be havior in the agricultural fields and countryside, both of which are sacred to her. Entering the agricultural field, one honors its sacred nature by wear ing clean clothes. Likewise, returning home, one washes hands and feet before entering. In the countryside, the Mixe must control their anger and sexual desire lest they arouse the wrath of Na-s w i-ñ, who can penalize a family for years for wrongful actions.</page><page sequence="11">Patrons of shamanic power 179 a being (Gossen 1974:41), and the consistent associations of this symbolic complex on the left side of compositions may indicate a similar belief among the Olmec. The other Mixe female supernatural, Higin-y, meaning "life," is the supernatural water spirit. Lipp (1991:32) relates that she "en genders the woman with life" and "conveys the child to the fam ily." As Tahin Nirkopk, "Queen where the water springs forth," she reigns over springs, rivers, and streams. Those involved in fish ing revere her and practice austerities in order to fish safely. Her spirit exists in the veins of the male member, a notion that helps demonstrate that gender complementarity is the ideal state for sa cred things among the Mixe, as it is among the Maya (Tarn and Prechtel 1986; Tedlock 1993). Whereas Na-s w i-ñ gives form to terrestrial aspects of the earth, Higin-y rules over bodies of water. If a similar dual concept of feminine supernatural reality configurations existed at La Venta, then the Massive Offerings of tons of green serpentine deposited into pits as large as 21 X 22 m (Reilly's [1994a] underworld seas) probably related to a water supernatural, such as Higin-y who con trolled the riverine and marine resources on which La Ventans de pended heavily (Figure 2). Higin-y has a strong relationship with the day sign Huginy, meaning "fontanelle" (Lipp 1991:68). The La Ventans probably conceived of springs, rivers, streams, etc., as female and represented this concept with the cleft, the opening between the human and supernatural realms, which can appear on any supernatural being or important parts of the human body.6 A cleft also appears on the northernmost edge of the Mosaic Pave ments.7 Reading these from north to south, the cleft (fontanelle/ Higiny) is closest to the actual sea/Higin-y (Gulf of Mexico). The bar stands for the surface of the earth/island/Na-s w i-ñ and the four stepped dots for clefts, where the sun rises and sets/holes where maize was planted/and seeds of (banded?) maize. The four fringed diamonds in the south must refer to the vegetation (including wa ter lilies and maize-of-four-directions) growing on the earth surface/ Na-s w i-ñ. MAKING OFFERINGS TO THE EARTH SURFACE SUPERNATURAL The Mixe call their vast assemblage of ritual procedures Na-s w i-ñmituni, or "work of the earth." Vastly simplified here, their rit ual practice involves creating a sacred space by placing offerings of pine bundles, each with a significant numerical count, and other items on the earth (Figure 11). In the dual-phase rituals, first res inous pine bundles are burned with other offerings to establish an exchange of sacred energy between the petitioners and Na-s w i-ñ. After this sacrifice, they offer some "green" pine bundles with other objects for the well-being and forgiveness of the earth and as ad eggs ^(70 candles 40 unbound pine stick bundles III 1111 I M I K11M11 Ifti III HI VIII 111 »1111 til H R 0 000 0000 eS8s ^ cross hole -^§P" road gun eggs 000 Figure II.

Sometimes, the pine bun dles represent a pine tree and, sometimes (when in conjunction with circular pine wreaths), the Mixe refer to them as the "male member" (Lipp 1991:81-88). The offering of numerically specific bundles of pine boughs and leaves may signal the persistence of the practice of placing many skillfully crafted greenstone celts above Massive Offerings and Mosaic Pavements at La Venta. In the Formative period, hard jade and greenstones, imported from distant places and crafted into celts shaped like corn ears or male members, seem to have been among the most valuable material offerings that could be made. Over each Massive Offering, the La Ventans deposited such celts in two kinds of arrangements. One consisted of numbers of celts laid in layers (Figure 12). Above each Mosaic Pavement, they placed a cruciform arrangement of celts, which Reilly (1994a) interpreted as the world tree and cosmic axis and Taube (1996:54) interpreted as maize cobs and sky-bearing axes (Figure 5). If La Venta's celt offerings functioned like Mixe pine bundles, they do refer to the world axis, maize, and male energy. Placed over ef figies of the female earth and sea, they engaged the powerful interaction among these sacred, animate realms. The Massive Of ferings themselves, the depositions of which initiated each con struction phase in the ceremonial court, probably functioned as their name indicates, as offerings to or places of ritual for Higin-y 6 The cleft has been interpreted as "the symbol of contact between di vinity and man by way of the crown or pineal gland" (Covarrubias 1946); as a signifier of "jaguar power" used to protect various parts of the body (Benson 1971); and as the portal in the earth to the Otherworld (Freidel et al. 1993:429, n. 21). Except for the reference to "jaguar power," these seem to be largely reasonable interpretations. 7 In a similar interpretation, Peter T. Furst (1981:150-159) also noted the relationship between the cleft head of the almond-eyed supernatural to a female terrestrial or subterranean-water supernatural. His argument was based on contextualized representations of V-shaped clefts in Mixtee co dices and the beliefs of Nahuat speakers in the Sierra de Puebla. He also saw the biological origin of this cleft as being the head of a feline toad, representing an Aztec Earth Goddess. I think the Olmecs substituted lo cally important creatures with specific features (such as clefts) for local representations of supernatural concepts and beings.</page><page sequence="12">180 Tate Figure 12.

THUNDER AND EARTH SURFACE SUPERNATURALS AS PATRONS OF SHAMANS Contemporary Mixe shamans possess at least one patron or guard ian spirit who is a "bodily presentation of God." They acquire their patron by petition coupled with a hallucinogenic vision or dreams. The patron "appears to both male and female curers as a well dressed woman or girl-child" or in "the guise of a serpent. She is regarded as a white thunder-being" (Lipp 1991:150). Although se lection, training, and initiation of shamans occur according to no set rule, Lipp (1991:150-153) sees two general patterns. Some sha mans receive a mandate from Na-s w i-ñ to undertake training. Being called by Na-§ w i-ñ while under the influence of halluci nogenic mushrooms inaugurates a pattern of training, by means of visions, that can result in curing accomplished through knowledge of medicinal plants and through clairvoyance. The other pattern involves a kindling of spiritual yearning in a series of dreams, in which Dios appears and shows the initiate words and designs that contain the wisdom of the universe. In a later dream, 'Ene- ap pears and teaches the initiate how to cure through laying on of hands and divination by using kernels of maize. 'Ene- is an an thropomorphic being of male and female gender but who appears primarily as male and rides the clouds in the form of thunder, caus ing lightning and winds to generate rain for the nourishment of maize and other crops. When he dons a special cape, rain falls, so the Mixe see him as a source of rain and, by extension, a spirit of maize. For this reason, maize seeds are sacred to him. This fertil izing spirit has the calendar name of 1/1 Turn Hukpi, or "One Root." 'Ene- is a shape-shifter: he can assume the form of serpent and eagle, and his "potencies" and "offspring" become poisonous snakes and jaguars (Lipp 1991:28-29). Thus, the two supernatural sum mon initiates and provide distinct forms of training and expertise. 'Ene- may descend from that represented by the ubiquitous, an thropomorphic, almond-eyed "Olmec supernatural," or "were jaguar." In the past, both human and nonhuman images have been referred to as "were-jaguars," but in this paper I refer to the as sortment of representations that have almond-shaped eyes, the down-turned upper lip, and a 1:2 head:body ratio (the head is about as large as the body or the rest of the piece; Figure 13). These proportions differentiate a representation of a supernatural from one of a human, and I have proposed elsewhere that the 1:2 pro portional ratio refers to that of a human embryo, as a symbol of the "seed" state of human life (Tate and Bendersky 1999). The Olmec supernatural most often appeared as ritual objects such as the large "votive" axes, on plaques worn on the headdress or chest, or occasionally as wearable masks. To the basic framework the Olmecs sometimes added a four-seed headband and accordion fold earflaps, eagle crests (Reilly 1995) over the eyes ("flame eye brows") and serpent or jaguar fangs. All these attributes correspond to the guises of 'Ene-. To learn and exchange ritual information, the Mixe shaman ini tiate travels to other villages (Lipp 1991:151-152). Such an ex change in the Formative period probably took the form of sharing the supernatural designs that were subsequently incised on "art" ob jects. Many Olmec objects such as masks, celts, and figures bear in cised designs of 'Ene-, including his mouthpiece and the Na-s w i-ñ headband, or cleft elements and sprouts (Figure 14). The Mixe prac tice of traveling shamans provides a practical explanation for the spread of Olmec ideology. Probably, shamans also exchanged the methods of disciplining the body through the standing and seated meditation postures that are the subjects of portable Olmec human figures (Tate 1998). In addition to shamanic designs revealed in dreams and visions and techniques for meditation, ancient exchanges probably involved unworked precious materials as well as crafted objects that encoded spiritual and political ideology. DEITIES OR PATRONS OF SHAMANIC POWER? The underlying assumption that Olmec civilization worshiped de ities has been criticized by Anatole Pohorilenko (1977), Tatiana Proskouriakoff (1978), Joyce Marcus (1989), and others. As Mar cus (1989:153) pointed out, when the Spanish quizzed the sixteenth century Zapotees about their gods, they responded with the names of former and contemporary rulers, the names of royal ancestors, and expressions addressed to supernatural forces. A basic problem of previous studies, which have tried to deter mine the biological nature of the were-jaguar, dragon, avian, rep tilian, and saurian creatures, is that they did not define the terms "deity" and "god," nor did they explain how such beings would be perceived in Formative-period society. Encyclopedias and dictio naries of religion, gods, and mythology demonstrate little unifor mity on the issue of defining "deity" or "god." A viable definition</page><page sequence="13">Patrons of shamanic power 181 Figure 13. Three "votive axes": [a] axe reportedly from Tabasco (private collection; height = 26 cm), thunder supernatural plus serpent fangs; (b) axe reportedly from the Mixtee region, Oaxaca [Museo Nacional de Antropología; height = 22 cm), thunder supernatural plus eagle crests; (c) axe reportedly from Veracruz (National Museum of the American Indian, Smithsonian Institution; height = 30 cm], thunder supernatural plus headband and jaguar fangs. Drawings by Carolyn E. Tate. of "deity" indicates that the term represents the human struggle at its highest. It denotes a character of divine excellence, which can be shared by many creatures. As a term, it is more abstract than "god," which was originally a proper name of the one God of the Theists. Historian of religion Raimundo Pannikar (1987) sees many hori zons of a deity: absolute consciousness, supreme being, creator of the world, and the location of the divine. In practice, cultures con ceive of several kinds of deities: meta-cosmological, in which as pects of nature are invested with divinity; meta-anthropological, in which the human being is perfected; and meta-ontological, in which the ultimate reality lies beyond the limitations of the mind and ma terial world in a blissful state of consciousness (Pannikar 1987:274 275). Based on the prevalence in Mesoamerica of rain, lightning, wind, water, and earth spirits, as well as spiritual forces in moun tains, and those that control game, crops, and human souls, and the absence of portrayals of any human beings as divine exemplars of morality (with the possible exception of Maya rulers), it seems best that we consider the Olmec situation in light of the meta-cosmological model. The concept of power inherent in aspects of nature falls closer to shamanism than any theism, and "deity" and "god" are not em ployed in the discourse of shamanic studies. If one looks for mon umental representations of purported "deities" at specific sites, one finds very few, a topic to be developed elsewhere. According to these definitions, no evidence supports the notion of a pantheon of dei ties in the Formative period. Instead, there seems to have been po tent super-normal entities associated with natural phenomena, which may have been petitioned by some individuals as patrons of spiri tual and political power. However, in Olmec studies, some scholars still operate with the concept that such a pantheon existed, as first proposed by Michael Coe (1968:111-114). He based it on an analysis of the five non human graphic images distributed on the shoulders and knees of the Lord of Las Limas and on the infantile figure held in the lap of the seated figure (Figure 14). In relating the incised images to the Aztec deities (Xipe, Lord of Spring and regeneration; Death God; Fire God; and Feathered Serpent/Wind God), he made the assump tion that "gods" existed in the Formative period. Following the jaguar-human mating hypothesis advanced by Matthew Stirling (1955) in reference to three partial sculptures, Coe (1968:111) pro posed that "the great god of the Olmec was the werejaguar [s/c], a combination of feline features with those of a human baby, which is believed to be an early form of the Rain God." Whitney Davis (1978) presented persuasive iconographic arguments that, be cause the supposedly copulating humans were clothed and similar confrontational poses on reliefs at Chalcatzingo clearly did not de pict copulation, the theory that were-jaguars resulted from a woman-jaguar union should be discarded. Nevertheless, the term "were-jaguar" is still used to describe various beings, as, for ex ample, in the catalogue for the exhibition Olmec Art of Ancient Mexico (Benson and de al Fuente 1996:170, 178, 211). Inspired by Coe's work, David Joralemon (1971, 1976) ana lyzed most of the known incised and relief images and created ten categories of representations, which he called "deities," and later streamlined to six categories. These early efforts endeavored to reconstruct a pantheon of male beings with fixed identities or do mains. However, after several attempts at refining the categories, the purported deities slipped from one category to another. There seems to be a few physical "frameworks" and numerous "extras" that modify each image of a supernatural. This slipperiness ap pears to be inherent in the identity and function of the images in Olmec art, so an appropriate ideological or religious model should allow for overlapping and shifting of identities.</page><page sequence="14">182 Tate Figure 14. Las Limas Monument 1. Drawing by Carolyn E. Tate. The "greater-than-human reality configurations" of the Mixe pro vide such a model. The Mixe conceive of several "powerful au tonomous entities" residing in thunder, rain, wind, and maize; in the earth's surface and sexual relations; in springs and rivers and human birth; and in mountains and animal spirit companions. These are gendered and can assume various forms (Lipp 1991:26-27). Most Mixe make offerings to these beings and recognize their do minion over all aspects of creation. The supernatural beings are accessible through dreams and hallucinogenic visions. A seeker may ask specific supernatural for instruction in realms of esoteric knowledge, and, in providing it, the supernatural being functions as a patron of shamanic power. In the most recent version of his taxonomy of deities, Jorale mon (1996) divided the almond-eyed supernaturals into two cat</page><page sequence="15">Patrons of shamanic power 183 egories: those wearing the four-nub headband and those without, calling the former the rain deity and the latter the "enigmatic were jaguar." He did not comment on Reilly's (1994c:255) proposal, with which I concur, that the four-seed headband worn by humans and the almond-eyed supernatural corresponds to the bar-and-four dots and translated into wearable regalia (Figure 9). Although the headband supernatural is the most distinctive of the almond-eyed supernaturals, I think it referred to both earth and rain supernatu rals. The almond-eyed supernatural may have a cleft head, with or without maize sprouting from it. Like the headband, this refers to a combination of female potencies (earth-maize and water spirits) that supplement the thunder-rain-maize power of the supernatu ral being. In the last and fullest "reading" of the Mosaic Pavement (see above), I pointed out that the cleft evokes Higin-y and the bar plus the four seeds, or directions, evokes Na-s w i-ñ. If Stross (1994:25), Reilly (1994c:255), and Taube (1996:43-44) are cor rect that the headband is a wearable form of the bar-and-four-dots, the Mixe analogy would make the four-seed headband an emblem of Na-ii w i-ñ as the dynamic processes of plant growth in the sur face of the earth (Figure 13). When the almond-eyed supernatural wears the headband, both earth and thunder/rain potencies patron ize the owner of the object, on which they appear. The almond eyed supernatural headdress plaques, masks, or pendants would refer to 'Ene- as a source of shamanic power for the wearer. Many localities probably represented their local version of 'Ene- in var ious ways, with or without the headband, or clefts, or sprouts, or with other zoomorphic features, on the votive axes (such as the Kunz axe in the American Museum of Natural History), which func tioned in ritual. In fact, several scholars (Covarrubias 1957:58-63; Coe 1965:752; Joralemon 1971:90) have intuited connections between the almond-eyed supernatural and a rain deity. What most fail to remark is that the supernatural form described above appears on regalia. They are not representations of independent deities but are on plaques worn by individuals whose very regalia indicated their powerful position (Figure 15). These symbols functioned as emblems of the sources of power for the shaman who earned the right to wear them. They represented that shaman's Patron of Shamanic Power: spirits analogous to 'Ene- (the almond-eyed su pernatural with assorted zoomorphic potencies), Na-s w i-ñ (a bar and-four-dots or headband), and Higin-y (the clefts). The almond-eyed supernatural and the four-seed headband have been subjects of an extensive recent analysis by Karl Taube (1996), who interpreted the almond-eyed supernatural as the Olmec Maize Deity and the headband elements as "cleft maize ear celts." He allowed that Fields (1991), Reilly (1994b: 181—182), and Marcus (1989:172-173), all of whom have discussed this set of imagery, did not refer to the almond-eyed supernatural or the sprouting im agery as a maize or any other deity (Taube 1996:42), and added that Joyce Marcus (1989) suggested that maize growing out of cleft heads represented the earth from which the maize sprouts. Her con cept fits better with the ethnographic framework of the Mixe than does Taube's of maize as a deity. The Mixe cultivate five varieties of maize in a range of colors and textures and serviceable in the different growing conditions available. Certain townships per form spiritual practices during the planting and harvesting peri ods. During planting times, a farming couple may observe sexual abstinence for a specific number of days, sacrifice fowl, and make Figure IS.

During the harvest period, ritual observances are lengthier. Farmers offer drops of mescal, in thanks to Earth, and perform a complex ceremony. Someone digs a hole near an embankment. Two maize stalks are shaped into a cross and set up near the hole. A matting of greenery supports offerings of maize ears, votive candles, lighted cigarettes, drops of mescal, and the blood of a sacrificed fowl, all of which are placed in the cleft in Na-s w i-ñ, accompanied by this prayer: God and Earth where the maize grows and beans climb, I ask par don for burning and cultivating land where I have planted yel low, black, while corn, beans, and squash. Lord Thunder, the winds of the north and south, listen and take care of what I have planted so that, with your help, I will harvest in abundance. I offer this turkey to you, Lord Thunder ['Ene-], south wind, north wind. I hope in you that my harvest is abundant and that it suffices for my daily needs. Mountains, fields, and highest peaks, all the pow erful of the earth, you who agree to give each of your offspring what they need, do not take amiss and favor my harvest. God, Earth, forgive me [Lipp 1991:20-22]. The Mixe respect and revere maize but do not consider it a deity. In this oration, after the Christian God, Earth and Thunder are the powerful supernatural forces. At La Venta, and probably else where in the Formative period, earth, water, and thunder were also the spiritual potencies in the forms of the horizontal, sprouting head band, fontanelle-like clefts, and the almond-eyed supernatural. Earth and thunder also functioned as patrons of shamans. LA VENTA'S REPRESENTATION OF PATRONS OF SHAMANIC POWER These two sources of shamanic power were portrayed in the group of figures in the standing meditation pose (Tate 1996) that formed the well-known La Venta Offering Four, buried in a hole in the em bankment flanking the sacred, female ceremonial court. (Note the similarity with the Mixe harvest ritual.) Two celts, each split in an cient times, accompanied the group of figures (Figure 16). Reilly (1994b:346, 374) reconstructed the celt designs. One shows 'Ene wearing the headband that represents Na-s w i-ñ, from which sprouts a plant also marked with her design. The other shows a figure in the dream flight related to the experience of shamans called by 'Ene-. Taube (1996:48) considered the Arroyo Pesquero figurine (Fig ure 15), in the collection of Dumbarton Oaks, as representing an impersonator of the Olmec Maize Deity. As an example of how the Mixe-based interpretations work with familiar iconographic elements, I offer an alternative explanation. The La Ventans prob ably used the spring site about 16 km south of the ceremonial cen ter as a sacred offering place where they might contact Na-s w i-ñ and Higin-y. At Arroyo Pesquero (also known in the literature as Río Pesquero and Las Choapas) in the 1960s and 1970s, villagers found a cache of some 30 stone masks, dozens of celts, the Arroyo Pesquero figurine, and other items. The figure sits in a meditation posture (Tate 1998) and wears the four-seed headband. A plaque of 'Ene- adorns the extension of the headdress. On the reverse of the extension is Na-s w i-ñ's design. The headdress or rear of the head is deeply cleft with four grooves, likely referring to Higin-y (one of her names is Higin-y Four Rivers; these might indicate rivers in the surface of the earth; Lipp 1991:32). The figure wears a special cape, which could be for making rain (as is 'Ene-'s cape), decorated with bird-head designs near the shoulders and with plants on the bottom rear. In the profile view of the figure can be seen Figure 16. Reilly's reconstruction of celts from La Venta Offering Four: (a) earth and thunder [Na-s w i-ñ and 'Ene-] regalia on supernatural form and (b) flying figure relating to shamans called by thunder ['Ene-]. Draw ing by Carolyn E. Tate (after Reilly 1994b:346, 374]. bird heads incised on the side of the headband. Cleft elements, possibly seeds, decorate the feet and earflaps and from the top of the figure emerge the triple sprouts indicating maize and beans (Scheie 1995). Intensive labor went into the production of this in credibly detailed figure before it was offered to Higin-y in the spring at Arroyo Pesquero. One wonders if the shaman who acquired both 'Ene- and Na-s w i-ñ as his patrons gave thanks by crafting or commissioning this piece. Taube (1996:50) also interpreted the stelae at the southern foot of La Venta's Mound C as images of the maize deity and the shamanic central axis. Following the Mixe analogy outlined here, however, on Monuments 25/26, 27, 88, and 89, the almond-eyed supernatural represented 'Ene- (note the 1:2 head:body ratio). On two monuments, 'Ene- wears the Na-s w i-ñ headband (the upper portions of the other two stelae are missing). One, Monu ment 88, shows a trace of a headband. The double-merlon, or sideways-E, above the headband also occurs on the Mosaic Pave ment design, reiterating the image's association with Na-s w i-ñ. Along with Rebecca Gonzáles Lauck (personal communication 1998), I think that the placement of the monuments at the site, although not planned during a single era, exhibits intentional pat terns. Regarding the images of these earth, water, and thunder supernaturals in Complexes A and C, 'Ene- appears in the south, associated with the Mound, and Na-s w i-ñ and Higin-y appear primarily in the north. Rebecca Gonzáles Lauck (1997:91) wrote that the six stelae at the foot of Mound C acted as "sentinels and</page><page sequence="17">Patrons of shamanic power 185 Figure 17.

Tate. witnesses of historic scenes; guardians, perhaps, of a possible fu nerary precinct." Interestingly, Na-s w i-ñ witnesses human ac tivities, providing the assurance of truth and wisdom. Four of these stelae represented 'Ene- with Na-s w i-fl's regalia. Farther north, within the courtyards, the Massive Offerings and Mosaic Pavements were hidden within the earth, the sacred ground in which the La Ventans placed skillfully crafted offerings. Most of the offerings consisted of plain stone celts, which, as Taube (1996:50) suggested, represent the conceptual set of maize cobs, trees, and world axis. The Na-s w i-ñ design decorated some celts, whereas shamans incised the image of 'Ene- with cleft and sprout on another (Figure 12). Some celts formed a cross design and others created a layered offering, both configurations reminiscent of the maize-stalk cross erected by contemporary Mixe at the har vest ritual, in which maize cobs and other precious items are cached in a hole in the earth. ETHNOGRAPHIC AND TOPOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATIONS OF LA VENTA Those acknowledged travelers, the La Ventans, observed and me morialized the features of the landscape they traversed, from the northern to the southern seas across the mountains and on the flanks of volcanoes. This paper suggests that the La Ventans deliberately selected the strip of north-south high ground for their ceremonial center because they could establish a central axis oriented toward the nearest high mountain on the southern horizon. Along that axis, they replicated the major features of their world, the Isthmus, whether that realm was defined conceptually, politically, or in terms of trade. To the north they made huge effigies of the sea; along the central axis, they placed earth designs; and in the south, they built a miniature mountain, establishing a sky-earth-underworld sha manic cosmogram and a simplified diagram of the Isthmus. This paper augments the current understanding of the ideo logical or spiritual motivations for the design and construction of La Venta's Massive Offerings and Mosaic Pavements by looking through the lens of contemporary Mixe ritual practice and sha manic cosmology. Despite the passage of millennia, the correspon dences in ritual practice astonish. The Sea, Earth, and Rain/Thunder supernaturals represented as the Massive Offerings, Mosaic Pave ments, and the almond-eyed supernatural parallel the three potent supernatural entities among the Mixe. The spiritual dimensions of Higin-y, Na-s w i-ñ, and 'Ene- reveal a rich tapestry of associations with Olmec life. Great Lady Four Rivers' (Higin-y) day is One Fon tanelle, and her name signifies "life." She controls water for people and other supernaturals as well as the rivers and sea and their fish. Human sexual intimacy is her doing, and she conveys the child to its mother's womb. Due to their dependence on marine resources, the La Ventans probably held in especially high esteem their female sea, water, and life supernatural, initiating each construction phase in the ceremonial court with an effigy of her. Na-s w i-ñ, the Earth, One World, the source of wisdom, knowledge and truth, today ranks next to Dios in importance among the Mixe. The concept of the earth surface female, the land that yields maize and is fertilized by the sun and human ritual, seems to have been of paramount importance at La Venta. The sprouting, four-directional earth symbol, the bar and four seeds, appeared on the Mosaic Pavements, one of which was worn by use. It also appeared as a revealed shamanic design incised on celts and as the headband signifying earth as a source of sha manic power. For the Mixe, 'Ene-, Thunder, One Root, is an an thropomorphic character who is the rain-producing, shape-shifting shaman. A multiplicity of 'Ene- exists, some of whom live in the earth and control forms of wealth, others who guard the mountains. He can also assume forms of animals. The Olmec almond-eyed supernat ural also appeared in many forms (hence Joralemon's (1971) initial 12 slippery categories of deities); is associated by nearly all schol ars with rain and maize; and guarded mountains, such as Mound C, or sacred caves, such as on Chalcatzingo Relief 1 or even the sacred courtyard at Teopantecuanitlan, where there were four almond eyed supernaturals.</page><page sequence="18">186 Tate The correspondences between Mixe and Olmec ritual practices are, I think, even more remarkable. Bundles of green pine leaves signifying world trees and maize arranged in numerically specific sets on an earth altar to thank the earth and petition her for life's necessities echo the ancient Olmec practice of crafting green celts representative of maize and the world tree. Mixe acts of deposit ing layers of maize cobs into the earth on a living green container and erecting crosses of maize stalks conceptually parallels the La Ventans' caches of greenstone celts in layers and cross forms. Ac tual ritual practice among the Mixe today is extremely complex, and I have simplified it to show basic parallels. Obviously, further work should be done on studying the Mixe in terms of their con temporary issues and for the ways in which their beliefs may illu minate those of their ancestors. Finally, the Mixe provide a compelling example of how soci eties conceive meta-cosmological and meta-anthropological su pernatural beings. Each entity influences an aspect of topography (bodies of water, earth surface, mountains, and caves), aspects of economic activities (fishing, maize agriculture, hunting), and as pects of human relationships and well-being (sexuality; truthful ness, disputes, reverence and gratitude; courage). Each relates to color, time and space, winds and weather. I would not be surprised if each also corresponded to celestial bodies. I think La Venta's supernaturals meant much the same to its inhabitants. In this shamanic-ethnographic model. La Venta's north-south axis pointed to the nearest high mountain south of the site. It also cor responded to the duality of the female earth crossed by the east west path of the male sun. With its effigies of seas and mountain, the site set up a dialogue with the topography of the area we call the Isth mus of Tehuantepec. Below the northerly, hidden, ceremonial court, the deposition of the massive greenstone offerings topped by the mo saic pavements created an effigy of the female powers of the seas and the earth surface with its vegetation. This earth-surface entity was a potent source of shamanic power, and shamans meditated on her and placed their own images in her generative womb. La Ventans cached hundreds of crafted objects within Mother Earth, including figurines representing humans in spiritual activities, and stone celts symbolizing world trees, maize cobs, and the male member, to thank and fertilize her in a sacred, private, ritual space. These objects re sulted from difficult travels, astute trades, shamanic knowledge, and artistic skills and embodied wealth, knowledge, and spiritual aware ness (Helms 1993). Although the lack of representations of women in stone sculpture implies that women did not play political roles in Olmec society, the, literally, massive offerings or sacrifices to the fe male earth and water supernaturals demonstrate that women's power was spiritually perceptible. The invisible, generative, feminine space was as intensively designed and constructed as the visible, politi cal, masculine architectural forms. La Venta is a primordial example of a sacred creation—an altar below and above the ground—that does not depend on the con sciousness of the spectator (because the most sacred parts cannot be seen) but on the knowledge or awareness of the participants. The sculptures of men, made of basalt and placed on the surface, con figured the political world, and the images of female supernaturals and highly crafted, precious offerings made to them form an ab stract array invisible to the eye but with a powerful hold on the mind. RESUMEN Este artículo sigue dos enfoques nuevos para resolver los "enigmas" de La Venta. Primero, examina la forma del sitio arqueológico con relación a la región de la que provienen las piedras que los nativos utilizaban: fundamentalmente, el Istmo de Tehuantepec. El eje norte-sur de La Venta apuntaba hacia una alta montaña cercana al sur del sitio. El diseño de barra y cuatro puntos en los Pavimientos de Mosaico correspondían a la dualidad de la madre tierra y sus plantas de maíz en cuatro direcciones, cruzada por el camino este-oeste del padre sol. Las Ofrendas Masivas previamente interpretadas como efigies de mares, que están al norte del espacio ceremonial, corresponden al océano que está a unos pocos kilómetros al norte del sitio. Segundo, esta monografía aumenta el cono cimiento actual de las motivaciones ideológicas o espirituales del diseño y construcción de las Ofrendas Masivas y Pavimientos de Mosaico de La Venta, al observar el fenómeno a través de la práctica ritual mixe con temporáneo y la cosmología chamánica. Los mixes son probablemente los descendientes lingüísticas de los olmecas de la Costa del Golfo. Usando estas dos líneas de análisis, la investigación propone varias tesis reía cionadas. Sostiene que los habitantes de La Venta planearon los Comple jos A y C (las designaciones de las plazas ceremoniales que contienen los Ofrendas Masivas, otros depósitos, y el gran montículo) para imitar la topografía de una región importante para La Venta, como proveedora de materiales y comida, y por extensión, de conocimiento. Correlaciona es pecíficamente las Ofrendas Masivas, los Pavimientos Mosaicos, y los for mas sobrenaturales de ojos almendrados sobre las estelas al pie del Montículo C, con las "configuraciones de una realidad sobrenatural" de los mixes contemporáneos. Aun más, contextualiza el problema del cha manismo al proponer que estos seres sobrenaturales no eran "dioses", pero fuentes de poder chamánico, y que los varios ofrecimientos enterra dos en La Venta tienen mas sentido si se los relaciona con aspectos sim ilares del ritual mixe, que ellos llaman "trabajos de la tierra". Finalmente, este trabajo concluye que una manera mas apropiada de expresar sus no ciones de lo sagrado es que los seres sobrenaturales eran concebidos como fuerzas meta-cosmológicas o meta-meteorológicas. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS During 6 years of planning for an exhibition of Olmec art to be held at the Dallas Museum of Art and the National Gallery in Washington (later sep arated into two exhibitions, one at the Art Museum, Princeton University, and the other at the National Gallery), Kent Reilly and I jointly developed the awareness that images of Olmec supernaturals occur primarily in their art as regalia. This led to our suggestion that the almond-eyed supernatural functioned as a patron of shamans, which underlies entries in the exhibi tion catalogue. The Olmec World: Ritual and Rulership. Subsequently, I explored how this proposition fit with the present-day ritual beliefs and practices of the Mixe, developed the proposal that the Massive Offerings and Mosaic Pavements correspond closely to Mixe female water and earth supernaturals, and wrote the first version of this paper, presented in a ses sion chaired by Cynthia Kristan-Graham on interpreting prehistoric archi tectural spaces at the College Art Association Annual Meeting, New York, 1997. Another version comparing ritual spaces considered female at La Venta and at Maya sites was presented at the Segunda Mesa Redonda de Palenque, also in 1997.1 thank the many colleagues at these meetings who voiced interest in and support for the analogy with the Mixe. More spe cifically, I greatly appreciate the comments, especially those that helped me clarify these ideas, by the reviewers: Flora Clancy, David C. Grove, Annabeth Headrick, Brian Stross, and an anonymous one.</page><page sequence="19">Patrons of shamanic power 187 REFERENCES Beals, Ralph L. 1945 Ethnology of the Western Mixe.
