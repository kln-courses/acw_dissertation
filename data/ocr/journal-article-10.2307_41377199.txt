<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wrinkles in technological progress WHY THINGS BITE BACK: NEW TECHNOLOGY AND THE REVENGE EFFECT by Edward Tenner Fourth Estate, ¿18.99, 346 pages, ISBN 1 83702 476 1 Edward Tenner has spent much of his career working among physical scientists. He should really know better than to invoke anthropomorphism in his title and in his stated pur- pose to explore 'the tendency of the world around us to get even'. But right now, it is easy to fall for this. We feed cattle with the bonemeal of other cattle and reap our reward in BSE. We transport oil in ever larger tankers which duly go aground, giving rise to ever greater disasters. Viruses mutate as if to outwit agents created to combat them. And as a Lon- don bicyclist, I observe that some of the worst driving is per- petrated by those driving a brand of car celebrated for its safety. There is cause and unintended effect but no revenge. Some of the fallacies and non sequiturs of this rather pernic- ious book are conveniently laid out in the publicity material that draws our attention to familiar domestic frustrations: 'Because of increased security measures, the person most likely to break into your car or home is you yourself.' Would you wish it any other way? 44 'Push button phones have led to increasingly long telephone numbers. Then, when you do get through, how often have you been confronted by voice mail asking for more numbers and leading to further delays?' Yes, this is irritating but it is less delaying than the pre-elec- tronic alternative. Aren't 'phone numbers getting longer because of demand for new lines? 'Cash machine queues are mysteriously longer in the evenings than those at tellers' windows used to be during banking hours.' Perhaps because there are fewer machines than tellers' win- dows and a natural concentration of people using them dur- ing a short convenient evening time slot. 'Electronic call waiting systems mean the caller can be left dangling indefinitely at the caller's expense.' So hang up! What Tenner melodramatically calls revenge effects are in reality no more than wrinkles in technological progress. The distillation of his argument is that we are not progressing as fast as we sometimes think. Big deal. If this were all, then we could cast Tenner's book aside, grateful for being made aware of the publishing industry's revenge effect: to publish books by 'scholars' that appear to address matters of importance but whose argument turns out to be built on sand. But there is a serious point struggling to be made, which is that designers need to make greater allowance for humans' irrational belief in, and reaction to, machines and technology. In his paranoia, Tenner does occasionally cry wolf when there is at least a cub of a problem. An electronic calculator doesn't go wrong often but if it does, you may not even realise it. I have long been struck by the shortcomings of roadside thermometers: because these are digital, we jpesume they are accurate, yet frequendy they are way off. Cföcks are little better: analogue mechanical clocks can be more reliable than digital electronic ones, yet we allow a generous margin of error when reading the former but presume total accuracy of the latter because they are 'precise' numbers which appear on the read-out. A new machine may reduce a risk - Tenner cites dialysis reducing the risk of kidney failure - but also bring new ones in the potential human error of its operators. Redress in these circumstances comes through the gross mechanism of liability legislation. For remedy, we must ask that manufacturers and designers make a greater part of their job the guessing of possible failures. Tenner's moral is that we must do more to anticipate the secondary effects of new technologies. But this may be impossible when, as he himself writes, 'it is part of the nature of radically new ideas that they are not the kind of ideas we thought they would be'.
