An analysis of the conversations reveal the topics and this information can be used to plan effective learning before, during, and after the field trip. If teachers use the attributes of animals that children spontaneously comment upon as the base for their curriculum work, more efficient learning about structures, behaviors, and categorization of animals could occur, because it would be constructed on the childrens' spontaneous observations. 29</page><page sequence="2">Introduction The school outing is very much a part of the school tradition and visits to collections of live animals, whether they be wildlife parks, zoos, farms, or other types of collection, are still a very popular and relevant place to visit for elementary school children. School visits to a zoo have definite educational aims and objectives (Marshdoyle, Bowman, &amp; MuDins, 1 98 1 ). The area of the curriculum upon which the visit is focused may not be biological, and some visits are arranged for the purpose of studying other subject areas, such as math or liberal arts (Tunnicliffe, 1994). It is known what attributes of animals children use to distinguish features on classroom exercises (Lucas, Linke, &amp; Sedgwick, 1979; Tamir &amp; Sever, 1980; Trowbridge &amp; Mintzes, 1985, Sherwood, 1986; Mintzes, 1 989; Sherwood, Rallis &amp; Stone, 1 989), it appears that movement is the prime feature for recognizing an animal as such (Bell, 1 98 1 ; Bell &amp; Barker, 1 982) and that locomotory organs are one of the parts of the body referred to most often by children. However, do the children focus on movement and locomotory organs when they look at live animals? Are there any other structures and behaviors about which they comment? The purpose of the study reported in this paper was to find out which parts of the body and behaviors of animals, observed in a zoo, that children noticed and commented. Furthermore, it was possible that there might be a pattern to these observations which could affect the way in which teachers could structure the work that they set their students to do before, during, and after the visit. Such a visit provides a number of learning opportunities that link with the science curriculum which contains specified statements against which the children are assessed. Typically such requirements include knowing how to group animals and recognition of major parts of the body. For example the National Curriculum for England and Wales in Science (Department of Education and Science, 1991) contains Statements of Attainment. The attainment statements are organized in ten levels which cover a child's legal entitlement to education from when they start school during the year in which they attain their fifth birthday to when they can leave at sixteen years of age. The students' progress to the next class at the end of each year 30</page><page sequence="3">irrespective of the level of attainment the child achieves in the standard assessment tasks (referred to as SATS) hence a teacher can have pupils of varying levels of attainment within the one class. At level 1 , pupils should: know that there is a wide variety of things, which includes humans. At level 2, the pupils should: be able to sort familiar living things into broad groups according to easily observed features. At level 3, children should: know that basic life processes common to humans and other animals; and know that human activity in the environment can affect changes in plants and animals. At Level 4, children should: be able to assign plants and animals to their major group using observable features have opportunities, through first hand observation. The program of study for Key Stage 1 , that for children of six and seven years, states that children should be aware of life forms which became extinct a long time ago and more recently. Over a period to time, pupils should take responsibility for the care of living things, maintaining their welfare by knowing about the needs and the care required for living things. Activities of a School Outing to the Zoo and the Curriculum Activities that promote childrens' learning in these relevant curriculum areas can be carried out to a greater or lesser extent in an animal collection. Teachers can: draw the attention of their pupil's to relevant features of the animals that they can observe and use for sorting animals into broad groups; point out the features used in allocating an animal to its scientific group such as the type of body covering; give the animal its scientific group and name, and ask children to point out the defining features. Looking at specific body parts and the behavior of animals are prerequisites for the process of categorization which is fundamental to an understanding of the variety of life. Therefore, it is useful to know what attributes the children notice and comment upon. However, the children come to the visit with knowledge accrued both in and out of school and with particular interests. I was interested to learn what children commented about spontaneously when looking at animals. 31</page><page sequence="4">The Project Dala was gathered in London Zoo during 1 991 - 1 992 (Tunniclifle, 1 993b). London Zoo has a wide variety of animals from all the classes of vertebrates and a large number the main invertebrate classes, so children's comments about a wide variety of living things could be heard The project collected the spontaneous conversations of the children and their accompanying adults by tape recording. Whether or not the groups listened to had been prepared for their visit, or were encountering the concepts presented in the zoo for the first time, is not known. This research project sought to establish, through ethnographic methodology, a description of what primary aged children and their accompanying adults talked about when looking at animal in zoos. The project set out to describe and explain what Cohen and Manion refer to as the "what is". The study also led the researcher to account for what Cohen and Manion (1989) describe as the "what has" occurred. I was concerned with providing descriptions of chiMren in their contexts. I accompanied children and their adults and &lt;aj»e recorded their conversations after receiving permission to uo so from the teacher in charge of the party. I stood behind the groups of children and their accompanying adult and moved with the group until they broke off from observing animals to be involved in some other activity, such as a classroom talk or lunch. The tape recordings were transcribed. Units of exchanges of conversations, defined as the "group conversation in front of any one exhibit from the beginning of the conversation until it ceased," were identified in the transcripts. An example of a unit of conversation is shown below. Bearded Lizards : Child: "There's one and there's one and there's one." Child II: "See that buffalo skull over there, thafs from America, and there's a light bulb, too." Teacher: "Can you sec the animals clearly?" Child: "No, they blend in." Teacher: "What do you call that?" Child: "Camouflage." 32</page><page sequence="5">Each topic of conversation was then coded according to a systemic network (Bliss, Ogborn, &amp; Martin, 1983); which had been worked out from pilot studies (Tunnidiffe, 1993a). A systemic network is a means of grouping or categorizing things. In this case conversations can be thought of as parsimonious representations of the data. As long as they preserve the relationships between categories in such a way that comparisons can be made between groups. The network can be regarded as the sets of boxes into which the researcher puts each part of the conversation. At one extreme of the continuum of categorizing the conversations, are highly specific items, while at the other end is the main descriptor, in this case "children's comments." The numbers at the right of the figure label the most specific level of table categorization. There were 74 categories in thisnetwork. Abar, indicates that an attribute may be either/or but not a member of both categories, while a bracket," { ", indicates one of a number of categories which an animal may have. Each conversation unit was categorized with the appropriate number from the networks. Hence i he above conversation was represented in the following way. Seven year-old Children at the Bearded Lizards 71/20/ 71/20 /71/20 Child: There's one and there's one and there's one. 50/ 74/ 55/ 18/ 40/ 20/ 16/ Child II: See that buffalo skull over there, thafs from America, and there's a 17 light bulb, too. 13/ 69/ 23 Teacher Can you see the animals dearly? 31 20/ 31 Child: No, they blend in. 13 Teacher What do you call that? 31 Child: Camouflage. 33</page><page sequence="6">The data was entered into a Minitab statistics package (Minitab Ine,. 1991), with a *1* scored in each category of topic which was observed in a conversation unit.

The re-marker disagreed with 5 instances of coding but also omitted 29 possibilities in the categories of structures, behavior, and exhibit comments. The proportion of categories consistently classified is represented by 'p.' 34</page><page sequence="7">p = 434-29-5/434 = 400/434 = 92% This represents a high coefficient for categoric coding. A better index of classification consistency is provided by Cohen's kappa coefficient which corrects p for the proportion of elements that would be consistently classified by both raten purely by chance. However, since the categorization presented here involves 74 categories, the difference between p and k is likely to be very small, so that in most cases, p will be an appropriate index of classification consistency. The content of the tapes were transcribed and then coded according to a systemic network which is a type of analysis that changed qualitative into quantifiable data. The results of this process were entered into a worksheet of a statistics package and counts of the categories made. Results The results provided a measure of the content of the conversations. However, the content of the conversations about body parts and those about behaviors fell into four categories. The main results are shown in Table 1 . Both the content and frequency of comments could reflect the age of the speaker because interest in a particular aspect of animals could decrease or increase with the child's development. 35</page><page sequence="8">Table 1 Results of Analysis of Conversations of School Groups at the Zoo Categories of Conversations Conversations Total n*459 No. P Body parts e.g. head, tail, sense organs 280 61 Behaviors e.g. feeding, moving, position in exhibit 301 66 Names, Comments using a name or comparing the animal to something else e.g. a toy 401 87 Finding out what is in the exhibits 289 63 Management/social statements 354 77 Affective attitudes including anthropomorphic statements 193 42 Emotive attitudes e.g. I like, I hate... 143 31 Other exhibit comments e.g. rock, tree 227 SO Table 2 Number of conversations which contained a reference to the categories listed (not mutually exclusive) Structure« Zoo results P total Pbody o = 459 total conversations part n = 280 n = 459 conversations (total conversations (n - 280) which refer to body parts) Cephalization 77 17 28 Morphisms 237 52 85 Unfamiliar 32 7 11 Disrupters 57 12 20 36</page><page sequence="9">Table 3 Main Categories of Behavior Commented on in the Museum and Zoo Behaviors Number of conversations Pof P of behavior at Zoo Live Animals 0x459 total conversations n = 301 (total conversations conversations comments referring to behaviors n=459 n-301 Locomotory movement 130 28 43 Positions in enclosure 177 39 59 Feeding 54 11 18 Attention "pullers" 115 25 38 The percentage of comments in each category was established as a value of the total number of conversations and of the total for the superordinate category, behavior or body parts, so that the importance of the individual categories within the total of comments bout body parts or behavior, could be clearly seen. Discussion Just over half of the conversations recorded and analyzed belonged to groups of children without an aduh but the results show that the children in these groups commented about the same topics as did the adult and children groups, the presence or absence of an adult did not appear to affect the content of the conversations. The data shows that 63% of the conversations of all primary school groups and 6 1 % of the groups with children only contain dialogue which is "accessing" the exhibits, in other words "looking for something to watch and talk about." What is still unknown, however is the extent to which children and their accompanying adults "access" animal specimens that are not exhibited to the same extent, 37</page><page sequence="10">in a farm for example, as are those of a zoo. Furthermore, we do not know the responses of children to animal specimens in the field nor to non-animal exhibits in a different type of institution, such as a cultural museum. This area of "exhibit access" invites further research into the initial behavior of visitors at exhibits. The visitors express their feelings about the animals (emotive attitudes) and make comments about the animals in terms of their relationship to people e.g. "Is it dangerous (to me)" and explaining the behavior and conditions in which the animal lives (affective attitudes). However, under one third of the conversations that were transcribed contained at least one comment of an emotive nature regarding the animals. This is contrary to the popularly held view among zoo educators and school teachers that school children of the elementary age group focus their observations, and hence their comments, around the emotional response to animals, particularly in terms of "like" and "dislike" noises, and comment, e.g. "Urg", and "I don't like that." It is interesting that the greatest proportion of comments in any category that did occur, at least once in the conversational segments, were related to names. This suggests that the priority of these groups was to label the specimen in some way, and hence categorize the animal, thus, setting the specimen within a context which contains meaning for the participants, even if it be non- scientific. Anthropomorphism is the term used to describe the interpretation the structure and function of other animals in human terms. It is not surprising the groups of elementary students interpret the animals' behavior from an anthropomorphic stance. What is surprising is that the adults with the children follow this practice. We do not know whether this reflects the normal interpretation of animals employed by adults with an everyday understanding of zoology, or whether it is the adults' response to the level of the childrens' interpretation. The groups spontaneously commented about the dimensions of the animals, the body shapes, the size and numbers of individuals. As many 85% of all conversations about body parts had a reference to this 38</page><page sequence="11">category of dimensions or morphisms. This suggests that the animal is viewed, initially at least, as a whole entity, followed with a seeking of expression in the manner that we humans look to the face of the person with whom we are seeking to communicate. Following these observations the children and their accompanying adults appear to be particularly drawn, sufficient to comment, to the disrupters, the parts of the body like tails that disrupt the body outline, and then to unfamiliar structures, such as blue bottoms of the owl-faced monkeys, a line of spikes, like those possessed by some species of iguana, or the brightly colored faces of mandrills. It is not surprising that a variety of types of movement attract comments, locomotion, or lack of it, causing children to question the "aliveness" of the animals, feeding movements or unusual movements, such as excretion or fighting that catch the eye, are movements that engender comments. What is surprising is that the behavior of the animal, in relation to its position in the enclosure, elicits so many comments, although this behavior is important in establishing the location of the animal for further observation. Particular aspects of the comments of the groups will be discussed. Recognizing the Environment Created for the Animais Once they have focused in on the exhibit 50%, of all conversations, and 47% of children's only conversations, were comments about the features of the exhibit other than the animal specimens. These comments were related to the exhibit "furniture", the setting, the trees, the rocks and children subsequently use this descriptive information to provide a set of references for the location of the animal. All exhibits are designed by people and impose certain constraints and the similarity of the proportions of conversations about the exhibits, other than the animals, could be a result of the animal being presented as an exhibit, rather than in its indigenous habitat. Furthermore, the exhibit created in the zoo is simulated for the animal and, while it may not resemble an authentic habitat, it is often reminiscent of human environments. Such similarities are identified by the children. In the following example of conversations at the Lion Terraces a two-year old child uses "exhibit access" dialogue, as he searches for the 39</page><page sequence="12">lion. Child: "Look at the Lion! Look at the lion. It's under the bed." The child pointed out an animal and added a description of something in the exhibit to help locate the animal. Familiar terminology was used to describe the artifact. Two children in a group of two-year old children in the Aquarium made the following comments as they searched the exhibit: Child I: "Oh! Look at that water! Where are the Fish? I can't see them." Child II: "There they're, at the back, they are brown." Comments About the Parts and Behavior of the Animals An analysis of content of the conversations show that the visitors to the zoo comment about the bodies of the animals in four main categories: cephalization or the front end (head and sense organs); morphisms or the body dimensions, shape, size, and color; unfamiliar bits e.g. horns, excretory and reproductive organs; disrupters which break the pattern of familiarity e.g. tails, legs. The comments about the behavior of animals also divide into four categories: movement; position in the enclosure; feeding; attention seekers, these are activities which occur when the visitor is looking e.g. excretion, play. 40</page><page sequence="13">Table 4 Comments about Body Parts Category of Comments about Body Parts Examples oí Conversations 1 .

It must have had a lot to drink."; Child II: "What is the other one doing?"; Child III: "Treading in the wee!"; Child I: "It's covering it up with sand." All the groups commented about the same aspects of the animals in the same amounts suggesting that all visitors make comments about similar topics hen looking at animals Furthermore, these results suggest that there is an "exhibit looking syndrome." Certain aspects of an exhibit are commented upon by all the visitors, simply because the animal is exhibited and the display or enclosure is part of what the visitor expects to look at. 42</page><page sequence="15">Explaining Observations Once children begin to look at an animal, they notice body parts and behaviors. The shape and the size of the animal within the context in which it is observed is important to the children. Markham (1989) observes that young children categorize by using a single criterion such as shape. This group of observations is the most predominate among elementary children. Furthermore, children notice and comment about the head end of the animal as if they seek response from the animal in the way that human encounters look at the face and seek nonverbal communication. Children explain their observations with reference to humans, particularly the self. Children use human beings as their reference point in their explanations about other animals until they are about ten years old (Carey, 1985). But in everyday situations adults tend to use this type of explanation too. Anthropomorphism is the term used to describe the interpretation the structure and functions of other animals in human terms. Children frequently use anthropomorphic explanations and 43 (18%) of children-only conversations referred to animals in this way. The following conversations that is between grade 1 children, looking at the gorillas, illustrates the type of comments made by visitors: Child I: "It's showing its teeth." Child 11: "Miss Wicks, look! Their hands are like ours." Child III : "There's a baby one. " Child IV: "Their hands look like ours." The grade 5 (eleven year old) children featured in the following conversations were looking at the gorilla, and interpreting his behavior in anthropomorphic terms: Child I: "I think he's feeling ill." Child II: "He sits so still he is bored." Child I: "Oh look at that one!" -and they moved on. The results of this study have implications for teachers in their preparation of the field trip and the advance organization of tasks and preparatory work. 43</page><page sequence="16">Preparing for the Visit Now that the topics that children spontaneously comment about have been identified. Teachers can design their programs for the field trip using the information as a starting point of activities, as a base line upon which to construct the stages of concept development. This will lead the children to the curriculum goal of knowledge and understanding of topics. There are various tasks which can be worked at in school, before the visit, that will help the children gain the maximum benefit from being able to make these first-hand observations about the structures and behaviors of animals. The following points should be borne in mind when planning an educationally-effective visit to a zoo. It is important that the children know where they are going and what they will be expected to do. Such orientation can be achieved by providing the children with maps, photos, slides, or a video before the visit, so their energy is not taken up on the day in finding their way around. Discuss the timetable of the day with the children before they visit so they know when they will have lunch and visit the gift shop. Explain the learning tasks that will be excepted of the children on their visit. Plan to study aspects of the animal which the children are more likely to notice such as: communication; sense oigans, their positions and function; foods eaten. This can be worked out by the type of mouth of the animal, and other position of its eyes and the type an position of teeth; and body parts which are adapted to the animals' natural habitat, e.g. camel's feet for walking on sand; streamlined body of the seal for swimming. For Kindeigarten students plan to look at body shapes, sizes of animals in relation to a standard or work on body coverings, which could include textures and color and function, as well as seasonal changes. Brief the other adults that accompany the group about the aims and objectives of the visit. Provide these adults with background information, so that they can both point out attributes to the children and develop observations further. Science is not common sense and the adults who accompany children on school outings need to know 44</page><page sequence="17">the science ideas that are the learning objectives of the visit They need to be able to "nudge" children toward them, moving them from their everyday knowledge. Brief the adults on the names which you would like the children to use. Bear in mind the names which the children are likely to use spontaneously. Children's spontaneous comments about animals as exhibits reveal an awareness of the features that are used to group animals. The visits, which are arranged so that children are able to look at animals, can form a central part of the children's work for parts of the curriculum. The visit can be used to introduce the topic, to consolidate the work followed in school, or to assess the children's understanding at the end of a topic. Whatever the emphasis is, the children wall be gaining experience from observing other living things and may be so interested that they pursue further scientific studies. References Bell, B. (1981).
