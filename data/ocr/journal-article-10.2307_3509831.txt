<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL CONTEXTS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE SOCIAL CONTEXTS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE1 RODNEY STARK Survey Research Center University of California, Berkeley The classic works on religious expe- rience were all written from a psychological point of view. Whether the phenomenon was considered "normal" or "abnormal", to the degree that an effort was made to explain the occurrence of religious expe- riences, primary attention was paid to var- ious aspects of the human psyche. Such terms as "auto-eroticism", "hysteria", "neurasthenia", "instincts", "guilt", "path- ological unhappiness" and "querulous mel- ancholy," characterize the variables used and the rhetoric in which they were cast.2 To a lesser extent these writers also credited certain individual statuses such as "insecurity of natural goods,"3 age, and sex as affecting the propensity for religious experience. I do not mean to suggest that such so- cial-psychological qualities of individuals are unimportant for an understanding of religious experience; yet it seems obvious that the most significant single cause of felt encounters with the divine was over- looked by these early psychologists. If we adopt a cross-cultural view of human affairs for a moment, it is apparent that the vast majority of instances when human beings have thought themselves confronted with supernatural agencies occurred in so- cial situations where, far from being un- usual, such experiences were considered normal. Indeed, in many such situations failure to manifest religious experience would be deemed atypical, perhaps even bizarre. The early psychologists regarded religious experience as problematic or even unusual on the basis of their conceptions of what was customary in modern societies. Had such a social science enterprise sprung up among the Indians of the Southwest, for instance, the question would probably have been posed in a rather different way: Why do some persons fail to undergo re- ligious experiences? The point I am trying to emphasize is that some social situations are structured to produce religious experiences among par- ticipants. In such circumstances it is as irrelevant to seek the causes of such be- havior in purely individual terms as it would be to search for a personality syn- drome to account for the fact that Roman Catholics typically genuflect when passing in front of an altar. The primary causes for such normative behavior are understood to be located in the social environment, not to be an additive outcome of unre- lated individually motivated actions. Basic Assumption Challenged All this is elementary. But I am pro- posing a somewhat more radical criticism of the psychological explanations of re- ligious experience than merely to point out that such theories break down when applied cross-culturally. I mean to chal- lenge the basic assumption that religious experience is problematic and is primarily</page><page sequence="2">18 THE REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH an individually motivated act in our so- ciety. Such an assumption, it seems to me, is predicated on a simplistic view of our modern society as homogeneous and on a corresponding failure to perceive the great tangle of sub-groups and sub-cultures which make an "American Society" some thing of a fiction unless it is defined with a good deal of sophistication. By ignoring the complex social character of the modern societies, these psychologists applied a rhetoric of abnormality to religious exper- ience prematurely, that is, without first distinguishing persons for whom such be- havior could be considered "unusual" from those for whom such behavior must be classed as "normal" (i.e., norm governed), Certain of the conservative and funda- mentalist denominations and sects in Amer- ica have well-organzied and institution- alized mechanisms for generating and chan- nelling religious experiences, particularly of the salvational variety. Anyone who has attended a revival meeting has observed a social situation where definitions concern- ing the appropriateness and character of particular varieties of religious experience are fostered and maintained, and where persons present are subjected to great pressure and inducement to conform to these normative expectations and consum- mate an encounter with a divine agency. Consider, for example, the collective na- ture of religious experiences among the mountain folk of Tennessee in this account by H. L. Mencken: [after a long harangue by a revival preacher and some witnessing by var- ious members on the efficacy of the Holy Ghost, the group began to sing hymns] . .. Suddenly a change of mood began to make itself felt. The last hymn ran longer than the others, and drop- ped gradually into a monotonous, unin- telligible chant. The leader beat time with his book. The faithful broke out with exultations. . . . At a signal the faithful crowded up to the bench [on which a young girl lay repentant for having "bobbed" her hair] and began to pray-not in unison, but each for himself. At another they all fell on their knees, their arms over the peni- tent.... Suddenly [the leader] rose to his feet, threw back his head and be- gan to speak in the tongues - blub- blub-blub, gurgle-gurgle-gurgle. His voice rose to a higher register. The cli- max was a shrill, inarticulate squawk, like that of a man throttled. He fell headlong across the pyramid of suppli- cants. From the squirming and jabbering mass a young woman gradually de- tached herself. . . . Her head jerked back, the veins of her neck swelled, and her fists went to her throat as if she were fighting for breath. She bent backward until she was like a half a hoop. Then she suddenly snapped forward . . . Presently her whole body began to be convulsed-great throes that began at the shoulders and ended at the hips. She would leap to her feet, thrust her arms in air, and then hurl herself upon the heap . . . [Her behavior] seemed to be contagious too, for soon a second penitent, also female, joined the first, and then came a third, and a fourth, and a fifth ... [one of these] was bounding all over the place . . . Every time her head came up a stream of hosannas would issue out of it. Once she collided with a dark, undersized, brother, hitherto silent and stolid. Contact with her set him off as if he had been kicked by a mule. He leaped into the air, threw back his head, and began to gargle as if with a mouthful of BB shot. Then he loosed one tremendous sten- torian sentence in the tongues, and collapsed.4 From the point of view of sedate middle- class churches and of Mencken's urban readers, such goings-on were a source of mirth or disgust, to be called bizarre, strange, foolish, and somewhat demented. But this is not the case viewed from the perspective of these backwoods partici- pants. To them, Mencken, who lurked in the shadows smoking a cigar, was the "abnormal" man. Not only is religious experience appro- priate in some contexts, but some groups</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL CONTEXTS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 19 foster and maintain norms concerning re- ligious experiences which members will seek and undergo in private. Considering the existence of such social situations in contemporary America, it seems likely that for some persons religious experience is not problematic but simply conformity to the norms of relatively stable social groups. For this reason, a search for the sources of religious experience must begin with an examination of the prevalence and effects of such social settings. By discovering how much religious experience is accounted for by compliance to norms, we will be in a position to search for the factors which elicit such behavior among persons in social contexts where religious expe- riences are indeed problematic or even re- garded as deviant. Furthermore, we can then seek to explain why persons join or remain in groups which sanction religious experiences. Types of Religious Experience In a previous paper," I have developed a detailed series of types for classifying religious experience, which was defined as some sense of contact with a supernatural agency. Four general types of religious experience were postulated: I) The Confirming Type: The human actor simply notes (feels, senses, etc.) the existence or presence of the supernatural actor, but the supernatural is not perceived as specifically acknowledging the human actor. 2) The Responsive Type: Mutual pres- ence is acknowledged, the supernatural ac- tor is believed to specifically note (respond to) the presence of the human actor. 3) The Ecstatic Type: The awareness of mutual presence is replaced by an af- fective relationship akin to love or friend- ship. 4) The Revelational Type: The human actor perceives himself as becoming a con- fidant of and/or a fellow participant in action with the supernatural actor. Within each of these types several sub- types were specified. Of these, only two subvarieties of the Responsive Type need concern us in the present paper. These subtypes are: a) The Salvational: being acknowledged as especially virtuous, "chosen", "elect", or "saved" by the divine actor. b) The Sanctioning: experiencing the displeasure of the supernatural actor; to be chastised or punished by the super- natural. The primary feature of this conceptual scheme is order. The underlying assump- tion on which the types were developed was that religious experience is a system- atically progressive phenomenon; that the diverse instances when men believe they have encountered the divine follow a pat- terned sequence. This development was likened to the pattern through which nor- mal interpersonal relations build up along a continuum of increasing intimacy. It was recognized that such development could be arrested anywhere along the way; but however much men may differ in the degree of intimacy they experience with supernatural agencies, they start at the same place and move along the same route. As was pointed out in the earlier paper, this ordering of religious experiences into a series of generic intervals along a dimen- sion of intimacy coincides with the order suggested by several other criteria, in- cluding the normative definitions attached to the various types by both religious and secular standards. Nevertheless, the case for this order must rest primarily on sta- tistical grounds. If religious experience is a unidimensional phenomenon in the man- ner specified, then the relative frequency with which the various types occur in the population must decrease from the less to the more intimate varieties. Similarly, men who have experienced more intimate types should have undergone the less intimate. Furthermore, the relative frequency of the types should decrease within the experience of individuals. That is, men who period- ically undergo several varieties of reli- gious experience should manifest the less intimate more often than the more inti- mate. They should also experience the less intimate prior to ever experiencing the</page><page sequence="4">20 THE REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH more intimate. Of these various tests of the postulated order, the last two cannot be assessed in the data at hand.6 Since respondents were not asked to date the first occasion of any particular religious encounter the case will have to rest on the relative frequency of types within the sample and by determining that persons who report more intimate experiences also report the less intimate varieties. The data we shall examine to determine whether or not such an assumption of order is war- ranted will also enable us to get some estimate of how common religious expe- rience is among Christian church members in contemporary America. Quality of the Data Before proceeding to this examination, several remarks must be made about the quality and form of the data. The ma- terials available on religious experience in this study are of two sorts. Several struc- tured questions asked respondents whether or not they had undergone various kinds of religious experiences. In addition, an open-end question sought voluntary re- ports of religious experience, some of which were quoted in the earlier paper. The open- end data are rich in detail, but are badly incomplete. Although they are probably reliable as far as they go, there is no way of knowing what additional experiences were omitted from these reports since the space provided was limited and respondents were not asked for a complete recounting of all incidents. Thus, many who wrote about being saved may also have had con- firming or ecstatic experiences, for ex- ample, which were omitted. In examining the questionnaires, many instances were discovered when experiences acknowledged in the structured items were not mentioned in the free response. Indeed, unless re- spondents have been attempting to be de- finitive and also shared our definition of what should be considered a religious ex- perience, there is no reason to expect the open-end responses to provide adequate data. For these reasons, the open-end data seem best suited to provide qualitative ma- terials on religious experience, and are of little use for quantitative purposes. The structured items, on the other hand, avoid this incompleteness, but are inade- quate in another way. For the varieties of religious experience to which they were directed, the structured items required re- spondents to indicate whether or not they had ever undergone such an encounter with the supernatural. These items pro- vide a basis for classifying all respondents. But not all of the types of religious ex- perience postulated were explored by struc- tured items. No items were included which tap the Ecstatic or the Revelational. One reason for these omissions, aside from the fact that the lack of a clear con- ceptual scheme made the choice of items somewhat fortuitous, was that it was little imagined how frequently modern Christians would report religious experiences. Items aimed at the more complex and intimate types of religious encounters seemed, then, as too extreme to be credible. Given these limits on both kinds of data, the burden of the analysis will have to rest on the structured items. Our quest for the social situational roots of religious experiences will be limited to the Confirming and Re- sponsive varieties. The question of the frequency of the types of religious expe- rience may now be taken up. Confirming Experiences One structured item in the question- naire is a strightforward inquiry about Confirming experiences-an awareness of the presence of divinity. Respondents were asked whether they had ever, as adults, had "A feeling that [they] were some- how in the presence of God."' Looking at the data in Table I we may see how commonly American Christians have undergone Confirming experiences. Forty-five per cent of the Protestants and forty-three per cent of the Roman Catholics reported they were "sure" they had ex- perienced such a feeling of divine presence. Additionally, twenty-eight per cent of the Protestants and twenty-three per cent of the Roman Catholics thought they'd had such an encounter. Overall, more than two- thirds of the Christian church members</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL CONTEXTS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 21 TABLE 1 CONFIRMING EXPERIENCES AMONG CHRISTIAN CHURCH MEMBERS Confirming "A feeling that you were somehow in the presence of God" Per cent who responded: Protestants Roman Catholics "Yes, I'm sure I have" ------------------------ 45 43 "Yes, I think that I have" -----------------------28 23 "No" ---------_---------- --------------- ------------------------------------------ 20 25 Did not answer ---------------------------------------------- ------- 7 9 100% 100% N= (2,326) (545) in this sample at least thought they'd had a Confirming experience, and nearly half were certain of it. The absolute frequency of even this least intimate variety of religious expe- rience seems something of a surprise. There are few cues in the culture which would lead an observer to predict so high a rate of supernaturalism in what seems to be an increasingly modern, scientific, and sec- ularized society. For example, characters in contemporary literature rarely undergo such encounters with the divine; and when they do, it is usually clear that they are odd people, old-fashioned, simple demented, and the like. Furthermore, a recent Gallup survey of a national sample of Americans found only twenty per cent felt they had undergone a religious experience of some variety.7 Of these, most were of the Con- firming variety. The great discrepancy be- tween Gallup's findings and those we are now examining must be in large part pro- duced by differences in the populations sampled. While about one-fifth of the general population reports divine encoun- ters, these proportions increase greatly among a population drawn entirely from members of Christian churches. This dif- ferential strongly suggests that having such an encounter is intimately connected with participation in religious situations. I shall shortly take up this question in detail; TABLE 2 RESPONSIVE EXPERIENCES AMONG CHRISTIAN CHURCH MEMBERS Protestants Roman Catholics Responsive (Salvational) "A sense of being saved in Christ."

For all that religious experiences may be strange, they are not unusual. Indeed, most of the persons in our sample at least thought they might have undergone a Confirming encounter with the Divine. Responsive Experiences I have earlier postulated that Confirm- ing experiences are more common than Re- sponsive experiences. The data in Table 2 support this assumption. Responsive exper- iences of both the Salvational and Sanc- tioning variety were considerably less of- ten reported than were Confirming expe- rience. Furthermore, the data reveal some interesting contrasts between Protestants and Roman Catholics. To seek an experience affirming one's salvation is a much more familiar part of the rhetoric of Protestantism than of Catholicism. This difference in emphasis is reflected in the data. Thirty-seven per cent of the Protestants were certain they'd had "A sense of being saved in Christ," while only twenty-six per cent of the Roman Catholics were certain they'd done so. An additional twenty-three per cent of the Protestants and twenty-two per cent of the Catholics thought they'd had such a sense of salvation. Looking at the second item in the table, Sanctioning experiences, the Catholics seem much more consistent than the Protestants. Many fewer Protestants were sure they'd had a "Feeling of being punished by God for something you had done," than reported a Salvational experience. Catholics re- ported Sanctioning experiences virtually as frequently as they reported the Salvation- al. Hence, while thirty-seven per cent of the Protestants were certain they'd had a Salvational experience, only sixteen per cent were sure they'd been Sanctioned. The same comparison among Catholics is twenty-six versus twenty-three per cent. These contrasts seem to match differences in the conceptions of God held by Protes- tants and Catholics. For many Protestants God seems endlessly benevolent-indeed, many Protestants believe in heaven, but deny there is a hell8-while the Catholic God is more often depicted as the judge who punishes as well as rewards. Simi- larly, virtually all Catholics in this sample who believed there was a heaven also be- lieved in hell. In any event, either sub- type of Responsive experience, as expected, is less frequently reported than are Con- firming experiences. Table 3 gives further statistical support for the proposed order- ing of the types. Of those persons who were sure they'd had a Salvational expe- rience, eighty-one per cent were certain they'd undergone a confirming experience, and an additional fifteen per cent thought that they had done so. Thus, TABLE 3 VIRTUALLY ALL WHO REPORTED A SALVATIONAL EXPERIENCE REPORTED A CONFIRMING EXPERIENCE* Since you have been an adult have you ever had ... A sense of being saved in Christ?

Seen in reverse, however, many who reported a Confirming experience did not also report a Salvational experience (only sixty-six per cent were certain they'd had one). These findings increase the confidence which may be placed in the hypothesis that the mani- festation of the more intimate types of re- ligious experience presupposes previous en- counters of a less intimate variety. Aside from theoretical considerations, this confirmation is methodologically for- tunate. For implicit in the discussion of the ordering of types was the expectation that religious experience has a cumula- tive or scalar quality; that encounters with the supernatural follow a developmental sequence along a single dimension. These data display this hypothesized scalar char- acter. Index of Religious Experience Given this outcome, we may briefly dis- cuss the summary measure, or index, of re- ligious experience that will serve as the basis for analysis in the remainder of this paper. The three items discussed above were used to classify respondents through a simple indexing procedure. In the sub- sequent analysis, initially the index was used in its original form, ranging respond- ents from a score of zero (earned by an- swering "No" to all three questions) to six (earned by answering "Yes, I'm sure I have" to all three). These tables re- vealed that all the relationships were iso- tropic-no matter what cutting points were chosen to collapse the index the direction of relationship was unchanged-hence, the index was collapsed into three categories for ease in presentation. The first cate- gory, High, contains all respondents who at least answered "Yes, I think that I have," to all three questions (combining scores of 3 through 6). The Medium cate- gory contains persons who thought they might have had one or two of these ex- periences (scores of i or 2). The None group includes only persons who were certain that they had not had any of these experiences. We may now return to the question raised at the beginning of this paper: To what extent are religious experiences nor- mal, that is, the product of compliance to the norms of social contexts?

While twenty-four per cent of the Congre- gationalists are classified as high on the index of religious experience, seventy-six per cent of the Missouri Synod Lutherans, ninety-four per cent of those in Sects, and ninety-seven per cent of the Southern Bap- tists scored high. Religious experience in- creases systematically from the more liberal groups on the top of the table to the more fundamentalist groups on the bottom. Overall, these data indicate that while religious experience tends to be uncommon or at least problematic among members of the more liberal denominations, the overwhelming majority of fundamentalists believe they have encountered some super- natural agency. These rather impressive differences reflect contrasts in the degree to which religious experience is explicitly sanctioned and fostered by the various re- ligious bodies. Such activity is regarded as somewhat unseemly in the more liberal denominations, while it is highly esteemed and encouraged by their more conservative brethren. But let us push these findings further. One important way in which these denom- inations differ is the degree to which they constitute quasi-primary groups. The more liberal bodies resemble occasional audi- ences of focused crowds, while the more conservative groups tend to resemble moral communities in the Durkheimian sense of the word. That is, the conservative re- spondents not only attach great importance to their church membership, as indeed the liberals do too, but their congregation serves as a primary source of informal social relations. For example, only twenty-nine per cent of the Congregationalists and thirty-eight per cent of the Episcopalians reported that more than one of their five best friends were members of their church congregation, while sixty-three per cent of the Southern Baptists and eighty-one per cent of those who belong to sects have more than one of their best friends in their congregation. Indeed, forty-five per cent of those in sects report that 4 or more of their 5 best friends belong to their congregation. Influence of Social Integration What can such differences in the nature of one's informal social ties to a religious community tell us about the social charac- ter of religious experience? Let us examine the relationship between denomination and religious experience with these friendship bonds controlled in Table 5. First of all, we can observe a mild specification. Among persons who have 4 or all of their 5 best friends in their congregation, denom- inational differences are moderately re- duced. Furthermore, the joint effect of social integration and denomination ac- counts for somewhat more of the variance in religious experience: from one hundred per cent of the Southern Baptists who have 4 or more friends in the congregation down to eighteen per cent of the Congregation- alists who have i or none of their 5 best friends in the congregation. Friendship seems to matter in all groups, but much more so in the liberal groups. But there is an even more significant finding to be read in this table. Among the liberal denominations, religious expe- rience tends to be concentrated among a minority subgroup which constitutes a so- cially integrated community of believers existing within the loose context of the audience-like, unintegrated majority of the congregation. Thus, within the liberal churches there are groups of members who resemble fundamentalists, both by virtue of their reliance on the church as a primary source of friendship and by their propen- sity for religious experiences. Hence, even in denominations where religious experien- ces are somewhat unlikely or at least problematic, such behavior tends to be a social phenomenon-the property of an in- tegrated subculture. Among the funda- mentalists, however, where the congrega- tions are in general highly bound by friend- ship ties and where religious experience is</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL CONTEXTS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 25 TABLE 5 DENOMINATION, FRIENDSHIP TIES, AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE PER CENT HIGH ON INDEX OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE Number of person's 5 best friends Denomination who are members of his congregation 0-1 2-3 4-5 Congregational ---------------------------------------- 18% (84) 40% (25) - %(10) Methodist --------------------------.------------- 36 (200) 49 (94) 52 (29) Protestant Episcopal ---------------------------------.45 (214) 53 (88) 76 (33) Presbyterian -------------------41 (239) 57 (113) 78 (49) Lutheran - --------57 (88) 83 (35) 80 (19) Disciples of Christ ---------------------------------- 61 (18) - (13) - (8) American Baptist -------------------......--------- 70 (53) 71 (38) 88 (24) Lutheran-Missouri Synod --- -------68 (60) 90 (31) - (7) Sects ------------- -------81 (36) 94 (78) 94 (91) Southern Baptists ---------------- 92 (25) 100 (24) 100 (19) Roman Catholics _--------------------------. . 55 (213) 57 (113) 65 (90) - Cells with less than 15 cases were not percentaged. the norm, persons who are not enmeshed in a friendship network within their con- gregation nevertheless report a high pro- portion of religious experience. This find- ing suggests that when the group in gen- eral offers marked support for religious experience, such behavior can be induced in the absence of significant affective bonds, simply through general exposure to the prevailing religious climate. The unintegrated members of the liberal bodies also tend to conform to the prevailing re- ligious climate by not undergoing religious experiences. These relationships were not affected by sex, social class, education or age, although each was modestly related to religious ex- perience. Role of Theology While these findings seem quite reveal- ing, they leave a good deal unanswered. For example, why is religious experience encouraged in some of these denominations and not in others? Obviously the mere names, Baptist, Congregational, etc., do not in themselves mean much. What is it then that distinguishes these religious bodies? When asked, churchmen have gen- erally said the primary differences among these groups are theological. In the past, social scientists have been somewhat re- luctant to accept such an answer and to thereby credit theology with any great causal importance. They have been in- clined instead to concentrate on such cleav- ages as social class, ethnicity, and the like. Indeed, social scientists have typically re- garded theological disputes among the de- nominations as rhetorical "superstructures" produced by and obscuring the "real" rea- sons, such as class, behind their conflicts.9 Thus, theology has been left to languish as a perpetual dependent variable, always a consequence, never a cause. Recently, we have been rediscovering what should always have been obvious: that religious beliefs have important im- plications for the ways men evaluate, re- spond to, and act upon, the world. In so intimately religious a matter as feeling in contact with some supernatural agency, theology ought to play a crucial role. Clearly, such behavior presupposes that persons have some conception of an active supernatural. These denominations differ greatly in the degree to which they are committed to traditional conceptions of Christianity, including belief in an anthropomorphic God with whom one may communicate.'0 To what extent, then, are denominational dif- ferences in religious experience a function</page><page sequence="10">26 THE REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH TABLE 6 DENOMINATION, RELIGIOUS ORTHODOXY, AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIE~CE (Per Cent High on Index of Religious Experience) High Medium .

If theology does play an important role in generating religious experience, then we would expect the denominational differences to be re- duced among groups sharing in a similar belief system. The Index of Religious Orthodoxy, em- ployed in Table 611 is based on questions concerning belief in a personal God, be- lief in the divinity of Jesus, belief in Bibli- cal miracles, and belief in the Devil. Each of these items posits a conception of an active supernatural realm. Turning to the data in Table 6, we see that theology does significantly interpret the relationship between denomination and religious experience. In all theological groupings, the relationships shown in Table 4 are reduced by nearly half. For example, among those high on the belief index, sixty- three per cent of the Methodists are high on religious experience, as compared with one hundred per cent of those Southern Baptists who are high on belief. This is a thirty-seven percentage-point difference, rather smaller than the fifty-seven points separating these groups in Table 4. Among persons medium on belief, forty-seven per cent of the Congregationalists and eighty- four per cent of those in Sects scored high on religious experience. This thirty-seven percentage-point difference is also mark- edly smaller than the 70 points between them in Table 4. Similar reductions oc- curred among those low on the belief index. Nevertheless, sizable denominational dif- ferences remain. This should be no sur- prise. For even though theology important- ly interprets the denomination-experience relationship, we ought to expect this link- age to be highly limited by social context. That is, an ideology appropriate for war- ranting religious experience ought to in fact generate such divine encounters most frequently when it is the prevailing, normal outlook of a social group; and the impact of such a theology ought to be muted when it is held by persons embedded in a social situation where their religious be- liefs are somewhat deviant and where re- ligious experience is itself problematic. We have considered the fact that reli- gious experience in the liberal bodies was concentrated in a subgroup for whom the church functioned as a basic source of the social relations. The majority of the mem- bers of these congregations, who do not draw their friends mostly from the church and who thus resemble members of audi- ences rather than moral communities, exhi- bit little propensity for religious experience.</page><page sequence="11">SOCIAL CONTEXTS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 27 To this finding we may now add the infor- mation that in the liberal churches it is par- ticularly those persons for whom the con- gregation is a primary group who not only are inclined towards religious experience but are also those who hold orthodox be- liefs concerning the supernatural. Thus, one could say that there are sects within these churches--amid the liberal and loose- ly integrated Protestant bodies are en- cysted subcultures of fundamentalist be- lievers, united by affective bonds, and for whom religious experiences are relatively common. It seems plausible to suppose that in these subcultures a system of norms en- couraging religious experience is main- tained. In short, we can regard a good por- tion of the religious experience that oc- curs even among members of liberal de- nominations as basically a social phe- nomenon. Conclusion It is now clear that the reservations raised at the beginning of this paper about the danger of prematurely considering re- ligious experience in terms of individual, rather than social, behavior were justified. The data indicate that a good portion of religious experience can be attributed to norm compliance within enduring social situations. To have applied an individu- ally oriented conception of causality with- out having first extracted those for whom this behavior is "normal" would have simply clouded the findings, and perhaps obscured actual individual effects. As indicated earlier, it is hardly our in- tention to deny the relevance of indivi- dual factors in motivating religious expe- rience. Psychiatric and other social-psy- chological theories may indeed prove use- ful in extending our understanding of this variety of human behavior, but only when applied in appropriate instances. Many persons may well undergo felt encounters with supernatural beings because they are caught in some disintegrating psychic con- flict, as Leon Salzman has suggested,12 but clearly such a state cannot be reason- ably attributed to the majority of persons participating in some stable social context. Hence, the social context within which a person engages in religious experiences must be examined before it is possible to assess the meaning of his act or assess his indi- vidual motivation. Only in relation to a man's context can we know whether his behavior classifies him as the most docile conformist or as a strange deviant. EXPLANATORY NOTES 1. This is publication A 42 in the series of the Survey Research Center, University of California, Berkeley. A shorter version of this paper was read at the annual meet- ings of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, 1964. 2. The three major works on religious experience are: James H. Leuba, The Psy- chology of Religious Mysticism, New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company, Inc., 1925; Edwin Diller Starbuck, The Psychology of Religion, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1899 and, of course, William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience, New York: Mentor Books, 1958, first published in 1902. 3.

The study is based on a random sample of the church member population of four metropolitan counties in Northern California. The data were collected through use of a self-administered questionnaire. Seventy-two per cent of the Protestants and 53 per cent of the Roman Catholics in the original sample responded. A study of non-respondents revealed bias in re- turns were negligible. Details of sampling procedures and data collection methods will appear in a volume on religion and anti-Semitism by Charles Y. Glock and the author scheduled for Fall publication.

American Institute of Public Opin- ion, poll of April, 1962. 8. See: Rodney Stark and Charles Y. Glock, "The 'New Denominationalism' " in this issue of the Review. 9. The classic work in this tradition was, however, by a theologian, H. Richard Nie- buhr. See his The Social Sources of De- nominationalism, New York: Henry Holt, 1929. I do not mean to deny the import- ance of non-theological factors in religious schism and conflict. However, these have too often been seen as sufficient conditions, when it seems clear enough that they are merely necessary. Granted that Luther would simply have been an obscure monk punished for disobedience had the social and political conditions conducive to a re- organization of German states independent of papal control not been present. But it must not be forgotten that the German princes would have been hard pressed to reject papal authority lacking the new source of non-papal religious legitimacy which Luther provided them. 10.
