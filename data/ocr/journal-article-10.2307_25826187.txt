<plain_text><page sequence="1">284 THE EXCHANGE Tne Cat's MeOW DAVID L. BERQUAM Jean Peters, R. R. Bowker Company, New York, New York, appears to have located the short story described by Frances G. Hoenigswald (RQ 18, No.l, Fall 1978). There is a short story by Roald Dahl, "Edward the Conqueror," in which a woman character (not a former concert pianist but **. . .a compe tent pianist and a genuine music lover ... ") believes a cat that has wandered into her yard to be a reincarnation of Franz Liszt. Other de tails of this story are different from those de scribed by Ms. Hoenigswald, but the story did appear in the New Yorker (October 31, 1953, p.28-36) according to An Index to Literature in the New Yorker. It later appeared in Kiss, Kiss, a collection of Dahl's short stories. It is mar velous and perhaps the work Ms. Hoenigswald's parents recall. Elaine Leppert, Boise (Idaho) Public Library, and Frances Bell, Dallas (Texas) Public Library, also identified kkEdward the Conqueror" as the item in question. Another query from Ms. Hoenigswald concerned the dates of National Cat Week. Responses from "Exchange" readers indicate that the dates are some what flexible; National Cat Week (now Cat Week International) has been cele brated early in November for some years. Lois Horowitz, University of California, San Diego, comments: I checked the San Diego Union Index and found two articles on National Cat Week. In 1957, the celebration began on Friday, Novem Tricky questions, notes on unusual information sources, general comments concerning reference problems and their solutions are wanted for "The Exchange." Send contributions to Dr. David Ber quam, Carlson Library, University of Toledo, 2801 W. Bancroft St., Toledo, OH 43606. ber 1; in 1960, on Sunday, November 6. I can't explain the inconsistency in dates of observa tion. Susan Biedler, Lycoming College Li brary, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, found the 1978 dates (November 5-11) in a "List of Special Promotional Days, Weeks and Months" published by Network Rates and Data (May 10, 1978, p.74). Other sources for this information include Chase's Calendar of Annual Events (for years be fore 1977) and the sponsors of the occa sion, the American Feline Society, Inc., with headquarters in New York City. Thanks to those who contributed so lutions, including Theda Upson, Richmond (Washington) Public Library, and Helen M. Amestoy, Angelo M. Iacobini Library, Lake wood, California. OPPOSITE EXTREMES The trenchant critique printed below is the object of a search by David Peele, Col lege of Staten Island (New York) Library. This book tells all about penguins. In fact, it tells more about penguins than I really wanted to know. Mr. Peele writes that "this is one of those stories everybody knows about a little girl who was asked to review a book. Can any 'Exchange' readers trace the origin of this anecdote? I've tried every quotation book we have under 'penguins' and 'birds' without success, but what if the word was 'dolphins' or some other species? The in quirer in our library was 99 percent sure it was penguins. What I need is the exact wording and original source of the story." Jim Doyle, Macomb Community Col lege, Warren, Michigan, hopes to learn the origin of this familiar line:</page><page sequence="2">SPRING 1979 RQ 285 Curiosity killed the cat; satisfaction brought it back! He would also appreciate any titles "Ex change" readers might recommend on the subject of undercrofts. Norval White's The Architectural Book (p.318) describes an undercroft as "a vaulted or timbered cel lar, under a church, useful for live activi ties, as opposed to a crypt, similar in structure and placement, which is a con tainer for the dead." In other sources, the term crypt seems to designate any under croft used for burial. Finally, the poem about water and wine (RQ 18, No.l, Fall 1978) sought by Natalie Fogel of Ossining (New York) Public Li brary may be "The Two Glasses" by Ella Wheeler Wilcox (1850-1919). Although the line "a cup of water, a glass of wine" does not appear in the text, the content and moral tone of the piece closely ap proximate Fogel's description. Another word of caution: Wilcox published more than twenty volumes of verse; hence it seems likely that certain themes received repeated consideration, if only inadver tently. "The Two Glasses" appears in Hazel Freeman's Best Loved Poems of the American People. Here is part of a ver sion submitted to RQ by Lelia B. Saun ders, Arlington County (Virginia) Librar ies. There sat two glasses filled to the brim, On a rich man's table, rim to rim; One was ruddy and red as blood, And one as clear as the crystal flood. Said the glass of wine to the paler brother: "Let us tell the tales of the past to each other; I can tell of banquet and revel and mirth, And the proudest and grandest souls on earth Fell under my touch as though struck by blight, Where I was king, for I ruled in might; From the heads of kings I have torn the crown, From the heights of fame I have hurled men down: I have blasted many an honored name; 1 have taken virtue and given shame . . . Ho! Ho! pale brother," laughed the wine, "Can you boast of deeds as great as mine?" Said the water glass: "I cannot boast Of a king dethroned or a murdered host; But I can tell of a heart once sad, By my crystal drops made light and glad; Of thirsts I've quenched, of brows I've laved, Of hands I have cooled, and souls I have saved . . ." And so forth. FINE TUNING From the William Patterson College Li brary, Wayne, New Jersey, Grace Wallace shares with "The Exchange" the tech niques of a successful search she suspects could nevertheless be improved. "As you see we finally found the necessary infor mation but in a round-about way. Perhaps 'Exchange' readers have some step-saving suggestions." A student had a textbook that contained the lines: "A man is known by the books he reads, by the company he keeps, by the praise he gives . . . ." The book attributed the quotation to Ralph Waldo Emerson but gave no further information. The student wanted the full quota tion and the title of the work in which it ap peared. We began by checking standard quotation sources under the key words ''company," "man," and "books," but could find nothing. We then searched a concordance of Emerson's poetry and an index to his essays and lectures, to no avail. We called a Reference Consortium and they checked several other Emerson concordances without success. They did find 14 other refer ences to "man is known . . ." in The Macmil lan Home Book of Proverbs and concluded that Emerson was not the author of the lines. At this point, we had two choices: believe that the textbook was correct and keep on looking or that it was mistaken and give up. We opted for one last try?we would follow the "pro verb" clue provided by the Consortium. We finally located the quotation in The Diction ary of American Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases 1820-1880 (p.233) under the key word "man." The bibliography referred us to the Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson. We have a set of Emerson's journals but not the edition cited in the dictionary. We located a library with the proper edition and were told that the lines were written on June 30, 1880. This ena bled us to find them in our set. Thus ended the "Great Emerson Quota tion Hunt." NEWSPEAK Gilbert Lorenz, The Heuristics Idea, Urbana, Illinois, is trying "to develop the idea of problem-solving as a general disci pline and I wish to introduce the word problemology as the study of problems</page><page sequence="3">286 SPRING 1979 RQ and problem solving." He asks, "Has this word ever appeared in any published work?" "Shouldn't we have a word which at tributes animal characteristics to inanimate objects?" This query (RQ 17, No.l, Fall 1977) prompted several replies from "Ex change" readers, all of whom suggested that animalize or other words already in our dictionaries could easily serve that purpose. Thomas J. Blauvelt, North Coun try Reference and Research Resources Council, Canton, New York, writes, I believe that we have at least two words that could be used to ascribe the characteristics of an animal to inanimate objects. The first is animalize: to represent in animal form. The second is zoomorphism: the use of animal forms in art or symbolism. The latter word is probably better for the intended use since its construction and sound imitate anthropomorph ism, and it does not have the pejorative conno tation of animalism (preoccupation with the satisfaction of physical desires). David Isaacson, Western Michigan Uni versity, Kalamazoo, also recommends animalize, citing Webster s Third New In ternational Dictionary, which gives as a first definition of the word: "to represent in animal form." Taken as a whole, the Dictionary entry emphasizes animalization of the human or divine, but it does not preclude a similar attribution to inanimate things. Isaacson concludes, kT don't see any reason for not using the word in other contexts, nor for coining a new word when an already existing one would seem to do the trick." THE GOLDEN STAIR Clues continue to accumulate about a poem mailed to "The Exchange" by Jean O. Smith (RQ 16, No.3, Spring 1977). Several possible sources have been iden tified, but Muriel Nelson, Anoka (Min nesota) Public Library, has submitted a version closest to the original. Perhaps it will jog someone's memory! According to Nelson, "The poem is one that I remem ber from about my junior high school days; it was one of those things that made the rounds with everyone copying it into their notebooks." I had a heart and it was true, But now it's gone from me to you. Take care of it as I have done, For you have two and I have none. When I get to Heaven and you're not there, I'll write your name on the golden stair, To let the angels know and see How my darling I love thee. If you're not there on Judgement Day I'll know you went the other way. I'll give the angels back their wings, Their golden harp, and other things. And to show what I would do, I'd even go to Hell for you. BIBLIOGRAPHY Chase, William Derby. Chase's Calendar of Annual Events. Flint, Michigan: Apple Tree Press, 1978. Dahl, Roald. Kiss, Kiss.
