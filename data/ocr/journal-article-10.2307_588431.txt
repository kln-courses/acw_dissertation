<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANOMIE AND DEVIATION- A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR EMPIRICAL STUDIES Gordon Rose* SINCE MERTON REPRINTED his well known essay on 'Social Structure and Anomie' in Social Theory and Social Structure a good deal of work has been done both in elaborating the theory and in trying to test it out. A recent volume (Clinard, et al., I964) not only surveys the existing work very competently, but adds some new evidence and a comment by Merton upon what he emphasizes is the developing theory of anomie. In his article Merton refers to some discrepancies between socio- logists in their interpretation of the term 'anomie', and he is wise to do so as a glance through a number of sociological texts will show. R. M. Williams (1951, pp. 53-7), for instance, quotes the Mertonian cultural goals-structural limitations analysis as one type only of anomie, and refers to 'cultural apathy with respect to standards of conduct'; which seems to imply withdrawal. He also, however, refers to conflict situa- tions in general. Johnson (1961, pp. 557-8) emphasizes ambivalency of attachment to norms, and it is not clear whether he means conflicting norms or individual reaction against accepted norms. He adds that there is also some widely effective structural defect, although he mainly emphasizes the conflict aspect, saying that anomie can be due to role conflict. Bell (1961, pp. 190-I) refers to 'the lack of goals or the over- emphasis on goal attainment'. It is usual to equate anomie with 'normlessness', but Bierstedt (1957, p. I77), taking a very literal view of normlessness, points out that 'A situation of complete normlessness, or anomie, would be intolerable, and no normless or anomic society could long endure'. Cohen (1959), using the analogy of a game the rules of which may not be observed, also seems to equate anomie with complete breakdown. Parsons (1937, p. 291) refers at one point to it as 'a polar type' (though polarities and continua are often confused in Parsons), * B.Sc.(Econ.), B.Litt., Ph.D., Reader in Social Administration, University of Man- chester. c 29</page><page sequence="2">GORDON ROSE and Rex neatly avoids the danger by referring to 'perfect anomie', as the opposite of 'perfect co-operation' (196 r, p. 54). Some confusion has arisen because of differences in the use of the original Durkheim conception. The original statement of anomie in The Division of Labour refers primarily to a breakdown of the regulatory mechanisms to which the term 'normlessness' might well refer. In Suicide, however, Durkheim is dealing with what might be described as special cases of anomie: where either the ends outstrip the means, as in prosperity; or the ends remain the same and the means are severely restricted, as in depression. It would not be profitable to enter into a textual argument as to how Durkheim intended these to be related, but Durkheim I (Division of Labour) is not quite the same as Durkheim II (Suicide), and a good deal depends upon the emphasis given by a particular writer. THE MEANING OF ANOMIE It is important to be clear what one is talking about. It is very easy to confuse the causes of anomie and the results of anomie with the meaning of anomie itself. In this article I shall discuss the meaning of the term first, then Merton's contribution to causation and various criticisms and some other points of view; and then the question of results, or adaptations. Merton has made a very clear distinction between social and in- dividual anomie and the latter has subsequently been called 'anomia'. In terms of theoretical analysis the distinction is justified. Anomie refers to a situation in which norms lose their validity to some degree, i.e. where there is uncertainty about the right way to behave in a social situation in the light of what can be expected of others. The first thing to note about the sociological concept of anomie is that it is --sociological. Anomie refers to a property of a social system, not to the state of mind of this or that individual within the system. It refers to a breakdown of social standards governing behaviour and so also signifies little social cohesion. When a high degree of anomie has set in, the rules governing con- duct have lost their savor and their force. Above all else, they are deprived of legitimacy. They do not comprise a social order in which men can con- fidently put their trust. For there is no longer a widely shared sense within the social system, large or small, of what goes and what does not go, of what is justly allowed by way of behaviour and of what is justly prohibited, of what may be legitimately expected of people in the course of social interaction. There is nothing obscure or mysterious about these abstractions. For example, a degree of anomie has set in among the masses of New Yorkers who throng the subways when they can no longer be confident that, in the main, they can take their rides in reasonable security if not in sybaritic comfort, but rather find themselves in fear that they may be violently attacked by some of their fellow passengers. A degree of anomie has set in when men and women 30</page><page sequence="3">ANOMIE AND DEVIATION hesitate to frequent parks once set aside for the public convenience for fear that they will be assaulted rather than refreshed in these surroundings. A degree of anomie obtains when social relations are hesitantly entered into in the reality-based fear of being double-crossed, of being taken in, of being deceived by partners to the relationship. And a degree of anomie obtains when men withdraw their allegiance from a structure of social stratification which requires that they accept a permanent disadvantage in the quest for the good things of life, when they reject the social arrangements which keep what they regard as their legitimate aspirations from becoming reasonable expectations, when for many abilities can find no outlet worth the effort. In a word, the degree of anomie in a social system is indicated by the extent to which there is a lack of consensus on norms judged to be legitimate, with its attendant uncertainty and insecurity in social relations. For if norms are not shared, then one cannot know what to expect of the other, and this is a social condition admirably suited for producing insecure relations with others. (Merton, 1964, pp. 226-7.) This is not quite as clear as it sounds, since a good deal depends upon the degree to which this legitimacy loss is incurred. None of us are entirely certain about the actions of others, and there is little point in a term which covers almost every situation in which one finds oneself. The intention is clearly that there needs to be such a degree of legitimacy loss that one must face up to the possibility of behaviour change, e.g. not riding on the subway at night. Secondly the types of norms involved are of considerable importance. As Durkheim points out there is a state of chronic anomie in the sphere of business, but he might well have said this about any transaction in which the actor is unable through lack of knowledge to predict the actions of others. It may be that the norms here limit the range of uncertainty (e.g. Robinson may disagree with me, but he will not cut my throat), but even these may go if there is great distrust and unpre- dictability. Third, the range of behaviour covered may be of consider- able importance. It may well be that too narrow a definition is unwise since the particular situation may be avoided, e.g. one can travel by bus rather than on the subway. Norms should therefore here be interpreted rather in terms of a complex of norms covering a range of behaviour. On the other hand, too wide a definition produces a concept of norm- lessness which is far too vague to be of any use to the empirical worker. Fourth, it is surely important that the legitimacy loss must lead to a degree of unhappiness. Many people like uncertainty, businessmen and diplomatists particularly, and can live happily with the minimum of norm legitimacy in certain areas. This point emphasizes the previous one that the type of norm is important. It may be that we are trespassing in making these points, upon the adaptations to anomie, but I do not think so. Anomie, as I use the term, is a loss of norm legitimacy sufficient to cause avoidance behaviour. In my view the term is defective in failing to indicate clearly what it means, and it 31</page><page sequence="4">GORDON ROSE has in any case been so loosely used as to become debased,1 and I would prefer the term legitimacy loss as a shorthand for the above phrase. I propose to use it below except where it is necessary to refer to other people's work. As stated above the division between anomie and anomia is theoretic- ally justified, but difficult to maintain in practice because any attempt to study them involves looking at what are in effect different aspects of the individual personality. The definition above implies 'unhappiness' which refers to an emotional state, whereas the most important term, 'loss of norm legitimacy', refers to values and ethical judgments. It is probably true that one can distinguish to some extent a feeling-state of being 'lost', but it is not very easy to define and measure and even more difficult to link with particular causes. It may, for instance, derive largely from poverty, or from pathological personality. I shall discuss Srole's anomia scale later. A definition involving norms must necessarily also imply a definition of the area of the social system to which they refer, geographical as well as in terms of strata, or institutions. This I call 'the referent area'. The referent area is the area of the social system from which the norms referred to are derived. This may be geographical and usually has some geographical element, but its basis is those ways of thinking which have arisen through imbibing the ideas and opinions of significant others, of groups, or from other sources such as the mass media. There may well be cross strata referents as in Merton (1957) and Cohen (1955). The referent area is grossly neglected in most social surveys, and this may be very dangerous. Questions are often interpreted, as experienced field workers know, in the light of a frame of reference which is unexpected by the questioner, and the answers may therefore be misleading. There may well be an important difference between the immediate referent areas (e.g. the gang, in which status management is of major importance (Short, 1964, p. 121)) and the wider referent areas from which come the 'middle class' imperatives favoured by Merton and Cohen. CAUSES OF LEGITIMACY LOSS Under this heading we first of all need to consider some generalities. Merton's description quoted above refers to a condition of weakened norms. It is common to refer to a situation in which there is a good deal of legitimacy loss of 'respectable' norms as anomic, and this may be due to their weakness. It may also, however, be due to unresolved conflict between norms; a situation where both respectable and deviant norms exist, and it is not clear to which the subject should adhere. This is the situation envisaged by Kobrin (1951), and the fact that the majority of deviant adolescents do not remain so in adulthood gives great colour to this suggestion. Ganging often accentuates the conflict, and the greater 32</page><page sequence="5">ANOMIE AND DEVIATION the structuring of the gang the more there is the likelihood of an apparent break with 'respectable' society. In this connection we must avoid thinking in what might be described as an anthropomorphic way. It does not follow that because intellectual, middle class sociologists tend to resolve conflicting value systems that everyone does so. Most people, and particularly those in the lower lower class, do not think conceptually with any ease and may not recognize the need to reconcile opposing ideas or behaviour, or may rationalize inconsistent behaviour with stereotyped phrases (see Bernstein, 1958, 1961). It is, therefore, possible to hold apparently irreconcilable views and to act sometimes upon one principle and sometimes on another without causing distress to oneself or others. A further situation, suggested by Cohen (1959, P- 48I), is where knowledge of norms is imperfect. This is a common condition of adolescence, as anyone who has ever tried to talk to youth club members or boys in correctional institutions will appreciate. We, therefore, distinguish three types of situation related to norms: very weak norms where the accent is on the strength of attachment; norm conflict, where the norms are strong but conflicting, leading to uncertainty in their legitimacy; and norm ignorance, where the uncer- tainty is simply due to imperfect knowledge. This analysis has a bearing upon the usual equation anomie = norm- lessness. This is in a sense true, but it depends very much what one means by normlessness, and since in some situations the norms may be very strong (in the Merton thesis, one suspects), it is misleading to use this without qualification. Both the concepts of anomie and normless- ness are derived from Durkheim I, but they are much too generalized to be helpful, and need qualification both in the sense of what is said above, and in the light of Durkheim II. MERTON, AND THE CULTURAL/STRUCTURAL APPROACH Clinard summarizes the criticisms of the Mertonian thesis under a number of headings: (I) It is claimed that the theory conceives of an atomistic and individual- istic actor who selects adaptations to the social system, and in so doing fails to stress the importance of interactions with others, who serve as reference groups for the actor. The actions of significant others affect the response and adaptation of the actor. (2) The deviant act is seen as an abrupt change from the strain of anomie to deviance, rather than as an event which has been built up through the interactional process. (3) Many deviant acts can be explained as part of role expectations rather than disjunctions between goals and means. (4) The dichotomy of cultural goals and institutional means, basic to anomie theory, may be so artificial as to have little meaning, since both are so linked in reality. (5) It is difficult to identify a set of values or cultural goals which could be considered universal in most modern, complex, 33</page><page sequence="6">GORDON ROSE industrial societies. The ends sought grow out of multivalue claims made on individuals participating in diverse groups. (6) The concept of anomie best explains deviant behaviour in societies where status is achieved; a different explanation may be needed where status is ascribed. (7) There is doubt that deviant behaviour is disproportionately more common in the lower class as the theory of anomie maintains. More studies of the incidence and pre- valence of deviant behaviour are needed before what is assumed by theory can be stated as fact. (8) Even if it is assumed that there is a higher rate of deviation in the lower class, there is the further question of why the bulk of the lower class uses conformity to achieve prescribed goals. (9) The theory stresses the importance of position in the social structure and ability to reach cultural goals. Such factors as subcultures, urbanization, and, especially, the role of group or collective adaptations are not normally taken into account. Short has pointed out in his paper that among lower class gang boys, middle class values are appreciated, but status is linked with more immediate on- going processes rather than ultimate ends. (Io) At the level of social control an important theoretical problem in explaining deviation is how deviant behaviour originates and how certain deviations lead to symbolic reorganiza- tion at the level of self-regarding attitudes and roles while others do not. The societal elements isolating and reacting to deviants are largely disregarded. (1i ) Finally, the adaptation of retreatism has been challenged, particularly as an explanation of drug addiction, as lacking precision and as an over- simplification of the process of self-evaluation. (Clinard, et al., 1964, pp. 55-6.) It is not, of course, surprising that a general hypothesis, briefly expressed, should fail to explain everything, and the assumption that it should, which underlies these criticisms, is misconceived. The real problem is not that Merton does not explain everything, but in the inability of his framework to be both wide enough and specific enough to generate a range of testable hypotheses. In saying this I do not under- estimate the great service which both Merton and Cohen have done to this part of the subject by stimulating a number of studies which have already produced extremely useful results, particularly those of J. F. Short, Jr. (1963 (a) and (b); 1964; Short, Tennyson and Howard, 1963; Gordon, et al., 1963). As Short points out, however, both of these theorists, though much more down to earth than many, are difficult to operationalize and the results of the studies made show far greater complexities than are theoretically allowed for. The attraction of Merton's hypothesis is not so much the cultural/ structural opposition, ingenious as this is. It lies on the one hand in the choice of the goal, and on the other in the possibility of explaining a rise in the incidence of deviation in a period of prosperity; something which follows directly from Durkheim II upon which the article is based. The choice of the material success goal, which is associated with prop- erty, may have some effect on the form of the deviation which results from its non-attainment, but the real point is the development of frustration due to blockage. The cultural/structural hypothesis, though 34</page><page sequence="7">ANOMIE AND DEVIATION developed some time beforehand is, however, surely a special case of 'relative deprivation' (Merton, I957, ch. 8), and the deviation- producing phenomenon is the development of frustration within the framework of relative deprivation. This means that the structure of the field of reference2 is of great importance, and one of the difficulties of the field studies has been in deciding what is meant by 'success' or by Cohen's 'middle class status' (Gordon, et al., 1963, p. I 13). The tendency has been to define this in educational and occupational terms and to try to assess whether the group studied aspires to a higher status than their reasonable expectations. Short, for instance, compares occupational and educational aspirations and expectations and uses the discrepancy as a measure of what he calls 'position discontent'. This may be a measure of aspiration; it may also be a measure of the proportion of the upwardly mobile in the population studied. A similar comparison (mothers' aspirations for the school child, as against his achievements and abilities, and teachers' ratings) has been used by Douglas (1964). The proportion may well be low in Short's gang sample, but it surely cannot be main- tained as Merton does (1957, p. I72) that it is enough for 'an appreci- able minority' of the lower social strata to show a blockage. These may as well be the people who are unsettled because of success through the educational/occupational ladder as through failure; and success may be measured by them in much less distant terms than those suggested by Merton. Short's work shows that much greater emphasis needs to be placed upon the frame of reference of the boy, and this is confirmed by Gold for both boy and family (1963, ch. 7). It is clear that what we are dealing with is relative deprivation within the frame of reference set by the limited terms in which the actor sees his world. This does not exclude the success motif, of course, but it also does not mean that it is of primary importance; indeed this appears not to be the case. Results which tend to favour the supremacy of the thesis are either, like Spergel (1964), based upon dubious samples, or depend like Palmore and Ham- mond (1963) and Mizruchi (1964) upon somewhat devious argument. A much more soundly based study by Kleiner and Parker (1963) demonstrates a relation between frustration and mental illness. This is interesting evidence, but does not explore very deeply relations between frustration (here occupationally defined) and other social factors such as vertical mobility. I do not propose to deal with all the points raised by Clinard. In particular, (6) above is not very relevant (except in so far as age related lower class behaviour might be described as ascribed); (7) depends upon a series of factual studies; and (io) is a question of process needing separate study. Role expectations (3) are important, but much of what I say here in terms of norms could be rewritten in terms of role expectations. They are a corollary of Merton's and my own definitions 35</page><page sequence="8">GORDON ROSE of anomie, both of which are concerned with what one expects of others; whereas role expectations are what others expect of the actor. An analysis starting from this basis would thus represent the reverse of the coin. In the present context, however, we start from anomie since this has played a central role in the controversies. For the rest, the reader will see that they are taken up in different forms in various parts of this article. FRUSTRATION AND WORKING CLASS CULTURE Short leans towards a cultural hypothesis rather than towards the Merton type of frustration thesis. Presumably Miller (1958) is at present engaged in developing at length his 'focal concerns', but it is clear that a frame of reference which is seen largely in working class terms provides a wide range of possibilities both for frustration and for acculturation theories (the English material has recently been ably summarized in Klein, 1964). In so far that there are middle class referents they are likely to refer to the upwardly mobile. The 'privatized' worker (Gold- thorpe and Lockwood 1963) or the 'respectable' worker (Stacey, 1960; Kuper, 1953) provides standards which are much more likely to be points of reference for the working class itself. Attitudes towards aggres- sion, and property and excitement seeking, are of considerable import- ance, as Miller points out, and while we do not have any English studies covering these points very clearly, there are distinct echoes of Miller in The Social Background of Delinquency (Sprott, et al., 1954). The cultural/structural analysis is, of course, based upon Durkheim's Suicide, and, as pointed out previously, one of its major attractions is its relevance to the present-day scene. It is no accident that Merton's essay remained unhonoured and unsung until it was reprinted in his Social Theory and Social Structure in 1957. Cloward and Ohlin (I960, ch. 3) are able to dispose neatly of opposing hypotheses by showing that they fail on various points of explanation, but, so would Merton if he had not been given such a comprehensive and extended treatment by his two disciples; the other propositions stated are much less well worked out. The cultural hypothesis would need to assume considerable changes in the culture, the reaction of adolescents to it, or police attitudes to arrest in order to encompass the rise in crime since the war. On the other hand it seems equally surprising that the emphasis on the success goal in the 192O's and 1930's in the U.S. and the even greater educational block- ages did not produce higher crime rates than the post-war figures. And no convincing theory has been put forward to explain the recent extreme rapidity of the increase in a number of countries. Little (1965) has recently made an analysis of the relevant figures which supports the indication in the high first offender success rates that a considerable proportion of the increase is in a more wide-spread but not persistent 36</page><page sequence="9">ANOMIE AND DEVIATION criminality. This provides backing for the contagion and cumulation theory put forward by Wilkins (1964), but there seems to be no indica- tion why a critical point was reached in England about 1956 after a decline over several previous years, nor what factors are likely to stop the cumulation before it engulfs the nation. The underlying criticism of a simple frustration or cultural theory is, however, that it is simple. It is difficult to believe that any of the hypotheses which have been put forward are as overriding as their pro- genitors seem to think. The real answers, as Short's work shows, are liable to be exceedingly complex, and to have elements of all hypo- theses. In this caucus race no doubt everybody will win, and, as in the original, everyone ought to have a prize. There is far too little work upon which to base any clear analysis at present but some things seem very important: I. The nature of the internal structure of what is loosely referred to as 'the working class' by all the American contributors to this field is of considerable importance. The referents are probably based much more upon working class culture than middle class culture, and may vary according to stratum. It is Kobrin's view (1951) that there is a persisting opposition of conventional and deviation producing forces in which the latter seem to be stronger in adolescence, but the former eventually succeed in early manhood. This is referred to above as strong norm conflict. Miller has not yet produced anything upon the balance of these forces, and only refers to those likely to produce trouble. Much of the work, however, which is cast in terms of middle class norms may well refer to the conventional or 'respectable' working class norm, and measures of the degree to which such attitudes are held are in fact measures of norm conflict which may or may not relate to a situation of relative deprivation. 2. The understanding of relative deprivation and the degree to which it is present depends upon knowledge of the norms of working class culture. 3. A particularly difficult problem is the degree to which norms are internalized, since it is not impossible for conventional ideas to be accompanied by anti-social behaviour, without reconciliation within the individual. Internalization depends partly upon culturally con- trolled ability to cope with concepts, partly on levels of intelligence and partly upon the degree to which behaviour is dominated by irrational elements stemming from abnormalities of personality. The strength of their combined effect probably grows as one moves down the strata. 4. It should not necessarily be assumed that the goals concerned are community goals. As pointed out above, it is not in practice possible to separate community and individual and it is thus, on the operational level, neither sensible nor practicable to think in terms of a purely sociological analysis. Standards set for the individual by himself and 37</page><page sequence="10">GORDON ROSE only distantly related to community pressures may often enough dominate his thinking, and may lead to behaviour which cannot be accounted for by analysis of the social system in which he lives. It should perhaps be added that the situation in America does not necessarily have a counterpart elsewhere. The American scene is dominated by mass poverty and serious minority problems. This may make the relative deprivation of poverty in plenty more acute, but it is also likely to curtail the referent area of those who experience it. The fact of rising discontent does not necessarily imply adherence to a remote economic success goal, or indeed to any specific institutional blockage, but to an increased belief that hardship and rejection can and ought to be lessened. In England, on the other hand, while the possibility of relative deprivation remains, there is little poverty and the minority problem is not serious. If relative deprivation is operating it must be of a different nature, but it is again unlikely to be related to distant goals. The pattern of criminality in England is also relevant, and rather more is known about it than in America or indeed in most countries. There appears to be a large and an increasing number of first offenders the large majority of whom do not re-appear in the courts. On the other hand the persistent offender seems to be more often a highly maladjusted personality than a happily adapted professional criminal. The general picture is of widespread law breaking of a minor character, of which the police pick up probably a not very large percentage; minor but effective punishment on detection; and then a gradual concentration upon a stage army of repeated offenders. It may be that these are the failures and there are successful criminals who rarely get caught, but it is at least sensible to suppose (as Erickson and Empey, 1963, show for a U.S. sample) that repeated offending heightens the probability of capture. The amount of group violence, incidentally, seems to be much exag- gerated in both England and the U.S., but the general level of violence seems higher in the U.S. ADAPTATIONS We have now to consider the question of resolution of the strains due to legitimacy loss. It is surely somewhat odd that in speaking of 'the modes of adaptation' Merton implies that an adaptation must take place, and his well known little table seems to suggest that a position of rest is reached by most people. If a state of anomie continues then presumably it must be maintained by those who are on the way to an adaptation which will remove this unpleasant condition, or there is a continued imperfect adaptation, or both. Merton's table therefore should surely take into account the degree of adaptation attained, the assumption being that most people do not solve the problem. It seems 38</page><page sequence="11">ANOMIE AND DEVIATION fairly clear, however, that he means us to assume that these are general directions of adaptation rather than the end state-railway lines rather than stations. If, however, these are not positions of rest there remains a balance of adherence to respectable and deviant norms (although this may not be true in the case of ritualism where there is no deviant element-but ritualism does not seem very important to Merton's argument (is it uncharitable to suggest that its existence grew out of the way the table is constructed?)). It is precisely this balance with which Kobrin is concerned in the article mentioned above, with which Sutherland is concerned in working out the principle of differential association (Sutherland and Cressey, I953), and of which one half only is found in Miller.3 Secondly, if Merton's 'modes of adaptation' were in fact end-states they would become goals in themselves. For if anomie is an uncom- fortable state of imbalance, then the goal is to arrive at some situation in which the balance is resolved. Thus innovatory, group-supported criminality is a solution to a problem which gives satisfaction, and releases frustrations. But Merton's modes are not equal in satisfaction of frustration; conformity and ritualism seem the most satisfactory, the others are likely to lead to community reactions, which may or may not affect the actor's behaviour. Thus by taking the routes of innovation, and probably retreatism, the norm conflicts are likely to remain strong since respectability is constantly reinforced; this is true whether or not the original loss of legitimacy was of the norm conflict type. This may help to maintain the balance of adherence. Merton's modes are, however, closely related to his general thesis and ought not to be used out of context; i.e. they are concerned only with the relation between cultural goals and institutionalized means. It would seem important, however, to attempt to establish the basis of his analysis by examining not so much whether working class goals are concerned with material success, but whether in fact there are any aspirations which are unrealistic, in terms of the working class life style, and how strongly these are held. If recent work has cast some doubt on the success goal, it does not invalidate the general concept of relative deprivation. SOME HYPOTHESES Theories ought to lead to testable hypotheses, but they are often not very easy to operationalize. No attempt has been made here to produce a theory-it is doubtful if there is as yet enough evidence to do so-nor indeed to do more than give some indications about the truth or other- wise of theories already put forward. What has been suggested are a number of concepts which are the parts of a theory which someone is 39</page><page sequence="12">GORDON ROSE eventually going to put together. In this final section, these are discussed in operational terms. It is obviously not possible in a short article to do more than indicate the lines upon which one might proceed, and this is done briefly. There follow some testable hypotheses using the concepts as described. Legitimacy loss If the major constituent of anomie as suggested above is uncertainty in predicting the reactions of others, it ought to be measurable in terms of expectations of others' behaviour. Studies of adolescents are likely to show a great deal of this kind of uncertainty merely because this is a characteristic of adolescence. The procedure involves either putting hypothetical cases to the persons interviewed, questioning them on specific situations which they are likely to encounter in real life, or observing them in interaction situations-or all three. Srole (1956) has proposed an anomia scale which is supposed to measure the individual feeling-state which is associated with anomie. It comprises four main components: feelings that authority no longer cares for the individual's needs; seeing the social order as futile and unpredictable; feelings that everything is getting worse; and an aliena- tion from norms making life seem meaningless. It has most recently been used in an altered form by Mizruchi (1964, pp. 161-2) and pre- viously by Bell (i957), but the original testing of the scale seems to have been sketchy and it is difficult to believe that 5 agree/disagree statements are likely to describe anything but the vaguest of feel- ings. Srole does not suggest that the scale measures anomie, which is a social phenomenon, and Mizruchi emphasizes that he is using the scale as an 'index to social structural strain and not as a means for the under- standing of personality dynamics'. Actually Srole's scale seems to be associated with class differences, and, if it means anything, seems to show that there is more general discontent as one goes down the class scale (Roberts and Rokeach, 1956; Srole, 1956(a), 1956(b); Bell, 1957; Meir and Bell, 1959). Whether this has any relation to anomie is unclear. It may be more closely related to the distribution of some types of abnormal personality in the population. The concept of anomie has, however, been exhaustively examined by the Survey Research Centre of the University of California (McClosky and Schaar, 1965). An anomie scale of nine items was administered in conjunction with a large number of other scales covering cognitive factors, emotional factors and substantive beliefs and attitudes. This large scale and complex operation gave results which showed that anomic feelings 'result when socialization and the learning of the norms are impeded' (p. 39) either by lack of ability to comprehend, or by an excess in the individual personality of anxiety, hostility and other 40</page><page sequence="13">ANOMIE AND DEVIATION similar traits which tend to distort the perception of reality. The holding of extreme or deviant views has the same effect. A 'status frustration' scale when partialled out of the correlations between anomie and various personality traits made little difference, and this is evidence against the frustration hypotheses. While the higher relationship found by Srole and others between anomie and low levels of educational achievement was confirmed, the major determinants were personality variables and this finding may well derive from the greater proportion of people with deviant personalities, including all degrees of mental disturbance, in the lower levels of the population. Anomie emerges as another way of describing a variety of dissatisfac- tions which might arrive from all sorts of causes, social and psycho- logical. This does not mean that frustration theories are entirely dis- counted, but the suggestion is that they play a minor part in the genesis of the condition. This raises the question of whether anomie remains a useful concept. It is so imprecise and general that it might well be better to abandon it. In my own definition of 'legitimacy loss', for instance, it might well be much more important to develop measures of reliance on actions of others in relation to specific areas of behaviour than to study a generalized discontent which might arise from many causes. Norm weakness, and norm conflict These are measured by the strength of adherence of subjects to state- ments indicative of various norms, and the relation between this and their behaviour. Short (Gordon et al., I963) uses what he calls 'semantic differential images'. These are descriptive of various orientations, e.g. someone who works for good grades at school, shares his money with his friends, or has good connections to avoid trouble with the law. They are rated on seven point scales embodying a variety of 'good-bad' polarities. The main areas covered are: dominant goal activity, leisure activity, and ethical orientation, but the method could obviously be used very widely. The evaluation scales could be adapted to show strength of attachment to particular statements. In these terms norm weakness implies general lack of strength of attachment, norm conflict reasonably strong attachments to conflicting statements, although both really need corroboration in behaviour. Stratification within the working class It seems clear from recent work that there are reasonably well defined strata within the English working class (Kuper, 1953; Mitchell, et al., 1954; Stacey, 96o0; Goldthorpe and Lockwood, i963; Klein, I964). The nature of the measurements, other than informed observation, which could distinguish these strata is less clear. The usual occupational/ educational indices no doubt roughly define the differences, but there is no necessary relation between husband's job and cultural differences 41</page><page sequence="14">GORDON ROSE in child rearing, and it may be impossible to distinguish between a large group all of whom left school at fifteen. There is an area here upon which work needs to be done. Luckily, it is not always necessary to define strata to carry out studies in the present context, but it is certainly difficult to say what is meant by a deviation from the norm if we do not know what the norms are! RELATIVE DEPRIVATION AND REFERENT AREAS We have referred above to the importance of both of these concepts, and have noted the distinction between the immediate and the wider referent area. This is essential because of the danger that the wider referent area may contain referents which do not have very much effect upon behaviour though they may be expressed in answers to questions. The actual referent may be a variety of things: an individual, a group, a status level, a norm, a goal, a value, even a fantasy of the way other people behave-or a combination of these. The reality of the con- sequent deprivation need have no relationship to the validity of the referent. The practical problems here are first of all in establishing the referent; in discovering where it resides (we tend to assume a great deal about what 'middle class' or 'respectable' norms are), in establishing the fact of deprivation, and in estimating its intensity. The procedures of Short's referred to above are applicable here also-indeed, study of norms in the terms outlined is a special case of studies of referents and relative deprivation. The procedures used in The American Soldier (Stouffer, et al., 1949) in validating attitude questionnaires and hold- ing responses constant to compare them with others has the advantage over Short of assuring reliability of scales. The difficulty in all these approaches, however, is in establishing the real validity of statements or questions, i.e. what they mean in relation to the life style and reference points of the individual replying. This one can only do, usually, by comparing replies, but there is much scope forjoining observational and deep interview techniques with the answers to questionnaires to establish the validity and nature of frames of reference. Abnormality This is an exceedingly difficult concept to measure. In this context, however, it is the departure from role expectations which counts, and a group or several individual opinions that a person is both unreliable and bizarre, or at least extremely strange in his actions, is enough for an identification of borderline mental illness. The identification of less pathological behaviour deviations can only be made by hindsight by studying the behaviour concerned. There is so much doubt, however, about identification of psychopaths that only extreme cases are clearly identifiable. 42</page><page sequence="15">ANOMIE AND DEVIATION We now come to the hypotheses. They are not a programme of research; such a programme might take years, and engage unobtainably large resources. They merely attempt to suggest some operationally testable lines of advance as alternatives to the present rather general hypotheses which now hold the field, on the assumption that the 'middle range' is a large area, and the lower quartile is a more appropriate place to start from. Hypothesis I: Legitimacy loss is more frequently found and is more acute in the ordinary than the respectable working class strata and highest in the rough stratum. The indications we have are that this is true. Hypothesis 2: Some legitimacy loss is due to norm weakness and some to norm conflict. This is a test of the concepts to see if they are true. Hypothesis 3: Norm weakness is highest in the lowest of the three working class strata, norm conflict is highest in the middle stratum. The assumption here is that the 'rough' stratum is more disorganized and suffers more from withdrawal and the effects of individual abnormality than the 'ordinary' stratum, which is fully exposed to the pressures of respectability. Hypothesis 4: The immediate referent area is more likely to affect behaviour than the wider referent area. This seems very likely and we have evidence for it. Hypothesis 5: Relative deprivation is strongest when measured in terms of the immediate referent area, and weaker when measured in terms of the wider referent area. This also seems very likely. Hypothesis 6: Relative deprivation is stronger in relation to material success goals than in relation to status maintenance. This is derived from Merton and Short. Hypothesis 7: Persistent crime is significantly more often related to norm weakness than norm conflict. Hypothesis 8: Transient crime (i.e. a pattern of one only or a few offences and then no more), and adolescent peak crime are significantly more often related to norm conflict than norm weakness. Hypothesis g: In the referent areas designated by Miller as 'focal concerns' norm conflict is weaker than in relation to material success goals. This derives from Miller and Merton. 43</page><page sequence="16">44 GORDON ROSE Hypothesis ro: The incidence of individual and family withdrawal and abnormality is highest in the 'rough' stratum and is significantly related to a high incidence and persistent criminality and weak norms. This is related to Sprott, Marsh and Emerson's unpublished study of lower class cultures (1964). I do not pretend that these are exhaustive, nor do I pretend that these concepts are easy to measure reliably and to handle, but they do offer some opportunity of starting out with a series of detailed points to test, and the eventual possibility of combining them into a theory which will bring us nearer to some real knowledge of the causes of deviation.

NOTES 1A totally indefensible use is that by Lander (I954) in which he identifies a factor with anomie because it has high loadings on delinquency, high percentage of non-whites, and low owner occupation. 2 Not the reference group, there may well be significant individuals, or self- images. 3 In a recent article Cohen (1965) lays stress on the interactive aspects of adapta- tion and the effect upon the availability of legitimate and illegitimate oppor- tunities as a result of the continuing re- lationship of ego (the person making the adaptation) and alter (those with whom he is interacting). Merton's analysis is too static, the parts of his system too discrete. D</page></plain_text>
