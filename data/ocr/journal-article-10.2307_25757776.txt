<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ambiguity of Evil Among the Nahua of the Sierra (Mexico) Italo Signorini and Alessandro Lupo Universita di Roma 'La Sapienza' In the present article we describe how a Mexican Indian group dealt with the idea of evil that the Europeans nearly five centuries ago introduced with Christianity, how the Indians made the idea their own and adapted it to their conceptual system. This process of syncretic mixing and adapting took in many of the con cepts and figures of Catholic thought, including good and evil in their respective manifestations (divinities, supernatural beings, spiritual powers and human feel ings). Good and evil, however, were not conceived as ethical absolutes clearly opposed one to the other, but as contingent realities, in which the positive or negative assessment of an act depends on the context in which the action was performed. And this was in accord with prehispanic religious ideas, which in this case successfully resisted the acculturation process. The ambiguity resulting from the rejection of a sharp dualism between good and evil is examined by way of some of the forms in which evil is manifested. Its iconography is important for an understanding of how evil is conceived and how the perpetrators of evil deeds are considered. By way of the divine figures that surround God (including a divine form of the earth itself), even the inclinations of God and the actions that arise from them display the ambivalent attitudes typical of the divinities of the prehispanic pantheon. We consider in particular the figure of the nahual ('sorcerer'), in whom all the ambiguity of the relationship between good and evil is clearly manifest in his ability to perform magic to the harm or benefit of his neighbor. In the latter case, the nahual deals with a person's illness as the effect of ill will, be the source human or not. Significantly enough, the instruments used for healing action are the same as those used to do harm. The reasoning is that the way to cure the victim of a spell is to strike the one responsible for sending it; and the cure employs the same means that person used. The 'ethical' difference between the two actions resides in the just cause supporting one action and missing in the other.

The Sierra was already isolated in the precolumbian period because of the dif ficult terrain and few roads, and it became more so after the Conquest as a result of changing trade routes and drastic depopulation in the major epidemics of the sixteenth century (Garcia Martinez 1987:113-115, 137-139). The demographic, economic, and political marginality of the region had obvious repercussions on the pace and manner of acculturation, which from the middle of the sixteenth century until practically the beginning of the present century was almost exclu sively under the aegis of missionaries, first the Franciscans and Augustinians and then the lay clergy. There were very few lay colonists until the second half of the nineteenth cen tury, so there was a minimum of the osmotic assimilation of European culture that was fostered elsewhere by frequent informal contact between the Spaniards and the indigenous population. The local population was subjected to the ener getic but discontinuous teaching efforts of the clergy, who often in their catechis tic work settled for acceptance of a surface orthodoxy, so that the Indians in the privacy of their own domestic and working life were able to preserve the basics of their own cosmology and religious system, which they freely adapted to the teachings of the missionaries. Thus what Carrasco (1975) calls a 'double religious system' also evolved among the Nahua of the Sierra. On the one hand, there was public religious life, mono polistically managed by Catholic priests who, since they came from geographical and cultural areas that were very distant from those of their parishioners, were unaware of, or underrated, the distinct conceptual world the Indians carried with them. On the other hand, private daily religious practice was managed personally by the Indians (or at most delegated to indigenous ritual specialists: healers, seers, tiemperos, etc.), and it was inspired by the same fundamentally utilitarian needs that had been successfully met by the autochtonous magico religious conceptual system until the arrival of the Spaniards. Moreover the clergy themselves, in hopes of facilitating and hastening evange lization, consciously exploited the many similarities between 'pagan' religion and Christianity and were responsible for a kind of 'guided' syncretism. This is what happened with such sacraments as baptism and confession, the commemoration of the dead, and the attribution of a patron saint to each community, all elements with exact counterparts in the prehispanic religious system (see Aguirre Beltran 1986; Nutini 1988). Sheltered by their own language and in the privacy of their domestic life, the Indians were left fairly free to interpret and develop the figures, rites, and 82</page><page sequence="3">values of their new faith in Christ; and they continued spontaneously along their syncretic path. They ascribed to Jesus and the saints qualities and spheres of influence that had belonged to the gods of the old pantheon, and they conferred inappropriate meanings on the mystery of the Eucharist and the blood-stained symbols of Christian sacrifice. They ended by professing a new syncretic re ligion - albeit indistinguishable on the surface from Catholicism - the distinct features of which are original and different from the simple addition of Christian and precolumbian elements. The process of syncretism was particularly keen with regard to those symbols, institutions, and beliefs that were most parallel to begin with. A good exam ple is the figure of the Christian Devil. In colonial Mexico the Devil took on many features of certain prehispanic divinities connected with darkness and the netherworld. For the missionaries all the figures of the 'pagan' pantheon were personifications of the Devil, but some had features that made identification more striking. Such was the case of Mictlantecuhtli ('lord of the region of the dead'), the skeletal sovereign of the ultimate chthonic home of the dead in the cold regions of the north. And it was even truer of Tezcatlipoca, the omnipo tent god of the night sky, the capricious arbiter of human destiny and protean patron of magicians, to whom countless human sacrifices were made, and who shared with the Old World Devil a limp, his leg having been devoured by an earth monster (Nicholson 1971:412; Soustelle 1940:29). Evil and its agents Evil, in the sense of the ensemble of negative forces that threaten man's physical and spiritual well-being, is called amo cuaii ('not good,' pi. amo cualime) in Nahuatl. It is fair to say that it corresponds to our sense of evil in an abstract general way, and the expression is used in this sense in common parlance. But it also applies to a set of telescopically arrayed extra-human entities that 'repeat' the source of their negative essence in a kind of descending hierarchy of danger and operational range. The prime manifestation of the amo cuali is the Devil, the utmost condensa tion of wicked possibilities and potential. The Nahua conversion to Catholicism centuries ago and the syncretic processes it triggered have set the Devil at the head of a vast army, a host including beings that were part of the prehispanic picture, others from Spanish folk culture, and still others from the canonical representations of medieval Catholicism. But they do not correspond exactly to the amo cuaJi, although people tend to confuse them just because the Devil has become the symbol, and hence the privileged 'form,' of evil. In line with the orientation of syncretic processes in the Sierra of Puebla for the historical reasons already mentioned, it was the amo cuali who absorbed the Devil, and not vice versa, although the Devil is the iconic manifestation par excellence that subsumes and covers a host of other more specific manifestations of evil. 83</page><page sequence="4">His first essence is that of invisible, ungraspable and all-pervasive air in motion: the amo cuaii, and hence the Devil, is ehecat ('wind,5 pi. ehecame), and so are the spirits that emanate from him (water and earth spirits, the spirits of those who 'died before their time,' and the familiar spirits of witches who function as human operatives in his service). Metonymically ehecat is also applied to the state of illness their action provokes, and it has a vast range of clinical manifestations. The breath of the amo cuaii may circulate in the human world in a pure state, not condensed in its specific emanations, and it is the element that constantly threatens to transform people from creatures of God into servants of the Evil One. The breath of the amo cuaii insinuates itself into people surreptitiously, helped by the imperfection and vulnerability of the bodily shell with which men are endowed. The human body serves as the temporary receptacle of the immortal soul, but it is also the most serious threat to the soul's eternal salvation because of the earthly 'appetites' to which it is subject. These appetites clash with the reality of an extremely poor and socially and politically subaltern peasant world that offers men a disproportionately 'limited' amount of goods, to use Foster's term (1965), in terms of their demand, and they unleash what is absolutely the most evil feeling - envy, rich and compelling on the level of sin and dangerous on the level of the community. The Nahua view of the matter is exactly the same as that of prehispanic times, a view that is shared by all the other Mesoamerican groups. It is also in perfect accord with the Mediterranean view of evil and its roots. It should come as no surprise, then, that the idea of envy as the first mediated cause of evil is so firmly rooted in present day indigenous society. One informant summarizes the matter very clearly: 'Where does the nahualot ("witchcraft") come from? It comes from some envy. And what is envy? How does it work, where does it come from? From the fact that this neighbour has much money... Envy is the amo cuaii; well, bad intentions'. Before going into detail, however, one attribute of evil requires special notice: evil is 'cold,' and this attribute extends to all of its manifestations. Evil is opposed to good in a general and almost Manichaean fashion. Good is life, dynamism, health, all elements marked by the opposite quality of 'warmth.' Indeed life - and it is clear that this goes back to prehispanic concepts - is the product of the flow of forces of heat and light that give life to the cosmos and are condensed in the individual in the flow of blood (Lopez Austin 1984). Red is its color par excellence, it is the color and as such it represents movement and life. Here too it is opposed - a constant that seems to be universal - to the two 'non colors' at the ends of the spectrum, black and white, and their 'not being' marks death, the subterranean, and the incorporeal, this last drawing with it, more or less consciously (particularly in Christian thought), the idea of purity and the immaculate. The ehecat is icy in its impalpable movement, like any being that directly or indirectly comes from the chthonic depths, the place of the dead whom the earth 84</page><page sequence="5">devours: ghosts, spirits of wells and springs, spirits of woods and caves. The hell of the wicked was accepted with the Christian eschatological view, but it did not keep the 'heat' it has in the Christian horizon: no hell fire2 or brimstone Devil. Instead it corresponds with the coldly hostile, 'northern' next world of the prehispanic Nahua tradition represented by the Mictlan ('region of the dead') (see Soustelle 1940:53). If the cosmos is conceived of as dominated by the bipolarity of heat and cold, animals involved with water, shadow, and earth3 are cold by homeopathic effect, but they do not necessarily have the evil character that structurally links the cold pole to the amo cuaJi and its most varied manifestations. While this is generally true, there are, however, some emblematic exceptions, the most interesting of which is the turkey. Unlike other animals, the turkey derives its 'cold' quality not from its relation to those elements of creation that carry and transmit the cold but directly from the forces of evil. The turkey is the sacrificial animal used in healing rituals addressed to the ehecat. The whole turkey, or just its heart, is offered to the chthonic (and 'diabolical') entities believed to have introduced the ehecat into the sick person's body to draw their appetite away from the vital forces of man (Signorini &amp; Lupo 1989:152-157). The turkey is often offered at the entrance to a cave, which is considered the point at which the diabolical creatures emerge from the lower depths. It is the turkey's connection with witchcraft and sorcery that makes it 'cold' - chickens and hens being 'hot' - and it is this contagion that also gives it a demonic quality, which is also expressed in the fact that it is one of the animals that witches can turn into to commit their evil deeds.4 Moreover in the prehispanic period the turkey, depicted as Chalchiuhto tollin ('precious turkey'), was the 'commonest theophanic form' of Tezcatlipoca (Nicholson 1971:412), the omnipotent dark patron of magicians. Going back to the entities in which the amo cuali takes form, generally known as ehecame, in an earlier work (Signorini &amp; Lupo 1989:138) the following division was made:5 ENCOUNTERS WITH EHECAME Type of encounter Penetration Type of ehecat INVOLUNTARY Wandering souls CASUAL VOLUNTARY Lords of places, Dead before their time PROVOKED * VOLUNTARY Demons (amo cualime), Damned souls, Projections of witches (nahuaime, sing, nahuai) DIAGRAM I 85</page><page sequence="6">The categories of ehecame that can penetrate and sicken people can be classified by their attitude to man, according to the following diagram: TYPES OF EHECAME HOSTILE INDIFFERENT Non-human (Lords of places, Demons) Human Spirits of the damned Projections of witches (nahualme) People dead before their time Wandering Souls DIAGRAM II These two diagrams show that entities which because of constitutional wickedness can provoke ehecat may be subdivided into human and non-human, but for our present purposes, what is relevant is whether or not they can be used as operative instruments of evil will. So we shall ignore lords of places, which take offensive action only when their sphere of influence is accidentally invaded. Likewise we shall pass over the 'dead before their time,' those who died before the time set for them by divine will and who must wander through this world until their time is due, for they do not attack out of personal wickedness or because they are manipulated by someone, but only because they seek a corporeal shell in which to consume the time they still must remain on earth (see Signorini &amp;; Lupo 1989: 49-51). Instead we shall consider witches (nahualme) and the 'spirits' they use as weapons. Nahual6 is the name applied to one who, by way of an innate gift or acquired knowledge, possesses and exercises magic aggression for purposes of evil. Beyond the classic subdivision of Evans-Pritchard (1937) between witches and sorcerers, the heuristic value of which remains unaltered, the Nahua include in the category of nahuaime both those who have acquired their powers through study and act through the power of word and gesture (sorcerers) and those who have innate powers, which they can apply magically without acquiring 'skill,' and exploit the qualities that their evil nature possesses (witches). The latter are, however, slaves to this evil nature, and this sets them irre versibly on the side of evil. But neither can the former elude negative ethi cal judgement, because of their willingness to act as instruments in the service of wicked feelings and desires (although the attitude to them is one of partial and unconfessed acquittal, because their 'professional needs' are acknowledged). What is particularly inadmissible - in a world that, for all its heterodoxy, has 86</page><page sequence="7">been Christian for five centuries - is the very use of magic, since it grants men dominion over their earthly destiny, that of others, and the forces of nature, dominion that goes far beyond what God allotted them in His plan, and tempts them to forget God by inebriating them with power and fulfilling their desires. There is, however, another element that helps to make the two categories one: while it is true that a sorcerer acts on the 'technical' knowledge he has acquired, it is also true that his will and capacity to learn, and the performance of evil that derives from this, are ascribed to a predisposition of his soul that automatically aligns him with the witch. Among the Nahua this predisposition is ascribed - in a harmonious synthesis of Mediterranean and Mesoamerican beliefs - to the accident of having been fated to be born at a particular hour on a particular day.7 Elsewhere we have noted that 'in Santiago a person can be a witch without being a sorcerer, but not a sorcerer without being somehow a witch' (Signorini &amp; Lupo 1989:102). Nevertheless, as in any context in which there is a belief in magic, it is always objectively possible (even for ethnologists) to identify the existence of sorcerers, but for witches the field of knowledge is part of the sphere of myth. That evil is considered something wanted by God, that it is part of His precise plan, as destiny established from the moment of birth reveals, does not arouse in the Nahua the same doubts and logical perplexities that have surrounded the theory of free choice in Christian thought. It does, however, mean that among the Nahua witches and sorcerers are somehow 'understood,' if not absolved. They are thought of and treated as part of the dangers that the world offers as the necessary and natural counterpart of what it presents to man that is beautiful, good, and happy. They are on the dark side of the same reality. The dark side gives meaning to its opposite and allows it to be: an archaic logic, with something universal about it, that makes pain, death, the undoing of the flesh a necessary element of rebirth and life. The nahuaime are thus linked to the chthonic depths, the powers below, the kingdom of the dead. And that is where Christianity sites the Devil, the incarnation of evil, God's enemy and opposite, so the nahuaJme necessarily ended by being linked to him, revealing, however, all the ambiguity of that forced localization. It should not be forgotten that the naJiuaJ, as its very name shows, is in a direct line of descent from the prehispanic nahuaJJi.8 The spirit entities of human beings To understand the wicked projections of the nahua], and hence their iconographic representation among the Nahua, brief mention is required of what they explain about the spiritual forces of the individual. Adapting the felicitous term in troduced by Lopez Austin (1984), 'entitades an/micas,' there are three 'spirit entities' that each person has. One, yoJo ('heart'), presides over human vitality 87</page><page sequence="8">and is infused in people when they are still in the womb. With Christianization it has blended with the immortal soul, which leaves the body on death, as did its prehispanic equivalent (the yoi/a). For our present purposes this spirit entity has no relevance. But the other two, the tonal (pi. tonaime) and the ecahuil (pi. ecahuilme), are extremely pertinent. While they have distinct features and qualities, they are so closely interrelated as to constitute two poles of a single ensemble, and it is extremely hard to consider them separately. The tonal - southern influence on the thought of the eastern Nahua is fully evident here9 - is the alter ego, a person's animal double, to which it is bound by a relationship of 'co-essence,' as described by Hermitte (1970) in discussing the Tzotzil Maya: a single existence sub specie two separate lives conducted in different shapes in different spheres that preclude any encounter with one's double. On the other hand, except for those glimpses of events at a spiritual level' (Pitt-Rivers 1970:190) occasionally offered by dreams, a person may be indissolubly linked to his alter ego by co essence without ever meeting it, in the sense that he does not know to what species his counterpart belongs nor the life spaces in which it lives and acts. Depending on what are considered the specific characteristics of the species to which it belongs, a man's tonal determines his nature, the inclinations of his spirit, and his physical and spiritual strength. Thus, for example, someone with a jaguar tonal will be aggressive and wicked, a deer will be shy, and so on. Our passionate or immoral acts, which lead us to violate the rules of community life, are thus due to the momentary dominance of the animal part of the binomial individual-tonal. An informant had this to say on the matter: Sometimes we dare to do many things: killing, stealing ... Why? Because that is how our tonai is, an animal. Because some animals are beasts, they force us to do bad things. But it is the animals that go for the tonaime that force us. There are some tonaime who, because of the dangerousness that experience or folk imagination attributes to their animal species, are believed to bestow a nature that is constitutionally (and hence potentially forever) inclined to evil. These include the jaguar, the nahuiyaque ('four-nostril') snake (Bothrops atrox), the owl, the turkey, and the black dog. It comes as no surprise then that these are the classic alter egos of the nahuaJme. The same features that the nahuaJ has of aggressiveness, perfidy, and proximity to night and darkness are variously distributed in these animals. Turning to the ecahuil, it represents the spiritual channel that actually ve hicles the mystic link between a physical person and the external zoomorphic spirit entity represented by the tonai. The ecahuil reflects within the individual the features of his animal companion, or, if you like, it is the animal companion within the individual. While the ecahuil is an extension of the tonal, it is ethe real and does not take on animal features. Rather, it has an anthropomorphic appearance reproducing that of the individual who contains it. And its visible 88</page><page sequence="9">manifestation is the shadow cast by the body, which is also where its name comes from (ecahuil means 'shadow'). In effect the ecahuil endows a person with the vital energy it draws from the tonal. This is why its traumatic separation from the body, for example, through fright, leads to illness and death. Untraumatic or 'physiological' separation occurs normally when the ecahuiJ leaves the sleeping body and transmits to the sleeper the events in which the tonal is engaged in his wanderings. We have already remarked that the instant of birth is important in terms of the strength that the tonal and the ecahuiJ will have in the future course of a person's life and hence the role and relative prestige he will have in the social context. What is of interest here is that nahuaime are believed to be born on Tuesday or Friday. According to a belief that is clearly inspired by Christian folk symbols, these are the days that the Devil's presence is most active, so people that destiny has brought into the world on those two days will have a decidedly sturdy ecahuiJ matched by a wicked tonal. What distinguishes the nahual is not just the fact of a 'strong' spirit force with negative connotation but, even more, the gift of knowing, unlike ordinary people, who his10 tonal is and of using it to his own evil ends by transferring his ecahuil into it. In this respect, the nahual of the Sierra is like his prehispanic highland counterpart (the nahualli; see note 8), as we know him from the literature of the early colonial period (see Lopez Austin 1984,1:424-430). He is also believed capable of total 'lycanthropic' transformation - local folklore is full of examples; but what distinguishes the activity of the Sierra nahual is his ability to project his inner self into his external animal self. Thus there is an inversion of the ecahuil's dislocation (here equivalent to an individual's ability to perceive and act) from one pole to the other of his co-essence, while the corporeal identity of the possessor is unchanged. This allows the nahual a mimetic defense, in the sense that his body is present and visible somewhere other than where the misdeed is committed and this always gives him an alibi. By Christian reflection, it is the ontological contiguity of the Evil One that permits the ecahuil to move outside the body and do harm to others. If the matter were considered from the two positions of the medieval church, the Augustinian and the Thomistic, in regard to witchcraft, as mentioned by several authors (cf. Caro Baroja 1964:43-44, 79-80), it would be legitimate to say that the idea of the nahual's transformation does not exactly fit either. According to St. Augustine, it was impossible for a witch to undergo a real physical trans formation, but it was rather the Devil who induced a special dreamlike state in which individuals deludedly believed they were transformed. St. Thomas, instead, held that transformation through powers given by the Devil implied abandonment of one's own corporeal identity to take on that of another being, often in animal form. This conception of witchcraft was responsible for the per secutory attitude of witch hunting in the Catholic world and, even longer, until the Enlightenment, in the Protestant world. 89</page><page sequence="10">Evil and the divinity In an essay on the Maya of Chiapas, Pitt-Rivers (1971:13-14) says: 4a distinction entre le bien qui provient de la divinite et le mal qui est son contraire ne s'opere qu'au niveau des evenements terrestres ou la motivation des individus est en cause.' Thinking about the Nahua situation, here too evil is not an absolute ethical category but case by case takes form in subjective experiences and the practice of those who do evil. Moreover, it is God himself who allows evil to exist and provides the qualities for doing it: if we think of the nahua], his destiny is determined ab initio, even though the resultant alliance with the amo cuali is always an act of sinful will. In this regard, the Nahua say that 'being a nahual is a gift... an authorization from God.' God Himself, in certain of His manifestations through which Nahua mono latry11 is expressed, not only allows the existence of Evil but ends up as its direct arteflcer. For example, one of His principal manifestations, the Earth as giver of life, which is identified with the Trinity,12 should merely receive and 'digest' the bodies of the dead, but instead it takes advantage of any spirit entity that may occasionally fall to it (we have seen that a fright may result in loss of the ecahuil) and take it prematurely. Occasionally it may even use its emanations to provoke the detachment of the spirit entity from the body. The divinity thus proves to be subject to appetites as well and to have lacks that only human beings can satisfy by way of sacrifice even of themselves. In short, in a cosmology in which the endowment of powers circulating through the universe is 'limited,' as the goods available to humans are limited, the divinity too has to compete to satisfy his needs: gods and men alike try to take from each other and keep the maximum quantity of vital energy (see Signorini &amp; Lupo 1989:73, 88; Lupo 1990). This also reflects a system of thought that has maintained a close link with the panorama of ideas dominant in the prehispanic period, in which good and evil as antithetical entities and as absolute qualities of superhuman figures did not exist. The dualism, however imperfect, that can be seen today is the fruit of the influence of Christian thought. Moreover the term cuali ('good') is not based on an abstract ethical category but on a utilitarian kind of assessment, which is evident in the fact that the word cuaii probably derives from cua ('to eat, to bite'), so its original meaning would have been 'eatable,' as Simeon suggests in his dictionary (1981:399). While the figures of the magic-religious imagination of the Nahua of the Sierra are generally arrayed in opposite camps corresponding to the Christian di chotomy represented by the two poles of God and the Devil, they still have within themselves the fundamental ambiguity that prehispanic divinities possessed. In the Mesoamerican religions of the post-classical period, it was believed that the life of man and the cosmos was regulated by an intricate alternation of propitious and unpropitious periods and events, due to the momentary prevalence of the 90</page><page sequence="11">positive or negative features that each divinity had mixed in him/her in an ambi guity of character that the iconography clearly illustrated. They were not good or bad in an absolute sense but propitious or unpropitious to man depending on the particular circumstances. Good and evil did not arise from each other, and hence they did not correspond in conceptual terms with the antithetical pair good/evil as it is structured by Christian thought, where evil is ontologically considered as detached from good and hence inferior. A purely formal parallel might be hazarded, that Mesoamerican religions are closer to Manichaean duality, where good is not absolutely superior to evil: light and dark are equal and independent and become mixed through the alternate advances and victories won by each. If, for example, we take the case of such fundamentally positive divinities as the rain god Tlaloc or the sun god Tonatiuh - supreme givers of life and vigor - their ambivalence is fully appreciable in their depictions, where they are shown as givers of the indispensable elements of water and heat as well as responsible for such excesses as drought and flood.13 The same is true today of several figures of the Christian pantheon. It is the case of John the Baptist, who is considered the beneficent giver of rain, because of his connection with the element of water, as well as the fearsome cause of floods. Or St. Ramos (imaginary creation of folk hagiography; see Lupo 1990), who is ascribed mastery of the winds, beneficent bearers of rain clouds but also fearsome destroyers of the harvest. Thus heaven 'ne s'oppose a aucun enfer, puisque le mal s'y fait autant que le bien' (Pitt-Rivers 1971:20). The same ambiguity can be seen in the figure of the nahuaJ, which is first connected with the powers of the netherworld. He is in the service of human passions and inspires fear, but he is also the one who has the skills to make himself a defender and whose profession allows him chances for life and pleasure that are denied to ordinary mortals. The practice of magic is morally reprehensible only when motivated by evil instincts and not when it is used to repel an undeserved attack or to redress an injustice, so that just cause condones the legitimate use of any weapon. The words of one healer, who is generally taken to be a nahuaJ, make any additional comment superfluous: Of course I help the sick, but if I liked money and they offered me a lot... Juana comes to me and says: 'Pedro doesn't love me any more, he isn't nice to me, he treats me bad, he beats me. Would you please help me. I want him to die, and I'll give you all you want'. Then Juana gives me a lot of money, and I am greedy for money, and I say: 'If you give me five hundred thousand pesos, I'll do it.' So then I begin to ask God: 'Lord, give me permission. I want to cast a spell on Pedro, I want to deliver him to the other to the Devil because he is treating Juana badly, very badly, he beats her and mistreats her and doesn't give her anything and chases after other women.' 91</page><page sequence="12">Notes 1. Nahua is the name usually given to speakers of the Nahuatl language, which belongs to the Uto-Aztecan family of languages. The dialect spoken in the Zacapoaxtla district, where the Missione Etnologica Italiana has been doing field work since 1980, includes the variation of the phoneme tl in t (hence, for example, the classical Nahuatl word for 'wind', ehecatl, becomes ehecat). The data used in this paper were collected by the authors in the village of Santiago Yancuictlalpan during the years 1984, 1985 and 1986. 2. It is the souls in Purgatory who are in the flames, souls that are considered 'holy' in Mediterranean folk tradition and are beseeched because they are halfway to God, give heed to the living, and are 'domestically' friendly. The ethereal creatures who wander around the world, instead, are 'souls in pain,' the rejected souls of those who have died before their time and must spend more time on earth before they can ascend to Purgatory - 'their time is not yet consummated' - or they may be damned souls that the Evil One uses as pawns in his own game. 3. In Mesoamerica 'thermal' qualities are ascribed to all elements of reality; the clas sification is based on essentially symbolic associations (see Lopez Austin 1984: 303-318). 4. In the Tlaxcala region (Nutini and Roberts, n.d.) as well as in the Sierra (see Signorini &amp; Lupo 1989:101), it is believed that witches turn into turkeys to commit their evil deeds. 5. Our aim was to examine the pathological effects of encounters with ehecame de pending on whether they were accidental or provoked encounters. 6. From the verb rJanahua, which Andrews and Hassig (1984:246) define as 'to inter pose something (between self and public, skin and outer clothing, man and gods, and so forth).' Hence the meaning of nahual is not based on the extraordinary and evil quality of deeds performed but originally on the transformation it permits: nahual is ' "an entity that can be interposed," i.e., "a mask, a disguise; a sorcerer" ' (ibidem). 7. In southern Italy you become a witch if you are born 'at a certain point' on Christ mas Eve, though obviously no one knows what that point is. Likewise you will be ciaraulo, a dominator of snakes, if you are born at a certain moment on January 25, the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul (see Burdi n.d.). 8. For the Nahua of the highlands, the nahualli was generically a practitioner of magic capable of 'metamorphosis.' In the acute analysis of Lopez Austin (1984, 1:424; II: 294), he would project one of his spirit components and introduce it into other beings and then act through them. He did not have a definite moral connotation, although his nature was seen as essentially wicked: 'The nahualli ... at night he frightens men and sucks the blood of children' (Sahagun 1985:555). 9. Foster (1944) showed that the idea of an animal companion to whom a man's life is indissolubly bound (now known as 'tonalism') was alien to the people of the central highlands. The belief arose in the southern regions of Mesoamerica and spread during the colonial period, facilitated by certain features of the religious thought of the peoples of central Mexico, chief of which was the use of a ritual calendar (in which the signs were largely zoomorphic) to decide the name and destiny of individuals (both called tonalli) (see Signorini &amp; Lupo 1989:41-44). 10. In Nahua thought, nahualme can be men or women, but most persons reputed to be nahualme are men. 92</page><page sequence="13">11. By 'monolatry' we mean a religion centered on the 'idea that there is a supernatural being who is primus inter pares,' as per Nutini (1988:9). In the syncretic Catholi cism practiced in the Sierra of Puebla, the monolatric pantheon is composed of God, Jesus Christ (the sun), the Trinity (the earth, see below) the Virgin Mary (the moon) and the saints (each connected with specific natural phenomena). 12. We have discussed elsewhere (Signorini k Lupo 1989:226-228; Lupo 1990) the associations that led the Nahua to fuse the Christian Trinity with the prehispanic dual earth deity: the term 'Holy Trinity' is now applied to the divine couple (male and female) which rules over anything that occurs on or under the earth's surface; as in Aztec times, the Earth-Trinity is still 'at one and the same time the great womb and tomb of all life' (Nicholson 1971:422). 13. See, for example, the depictions of the four Tlaloque in the Codex Borgia (1980, Pis. 27-28), or those of the sun in the Codex Borbonicus (1985, PI. 16 and passim).
