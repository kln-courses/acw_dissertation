His boldly asymmetrical model for these candlesticks was recorded in three drawings that were then engraved by Gabriel Huquier and pub- lished in Dousieme livre des oeuvres deJ. A. Meissonnier, Livre de chandeliers de sculpture en argent (1728; pls. 73-75). The design became widely popular and was often exe- cuted in gilt bronze. Examples of the highest quality, such as the present pair, were probably supervised by Meissonnier himself. 700 - 1900 The model was also made in silver. It was used for a three-branch candelabra, part of a famous silver service acquired by the duke of Kingston in I737, which is now in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris.

Their pis- tols, unlike those made elsewhere in Britain, were constructed entirely from metal, usually steel, and were engraved and often silver- inlaid with geometric and foliate ornament of Celtic inspiration. This pair, signed by the renowned gunmaker Campbell, of Doune, Perthshire, is a classic example of the type. Among the defining features are the scrolled "ram's-horn" butts, button-shaped triggers (without trigger guards) and prickers (to clean the touchhole), decorative pierced rosettes behind the head of the cock, and belt hooks mounted on the side opposite the locks. Our pistols are also noteworthy for their American association. The grips are inlaid with silver plaques inscribed "Abrm B. Embury / New York 1830," identifying them as having belonged to a member of a distin- guished New York family. The pistols' unusually crisp condition testifies to their preservation as treasured heirlooms for almost two centuries.

(24. x _r8.7 cm) Gift of Mrs. Charles Wrightsman, 2000zooo 200ooo0.7 Born in Geneva and largely self-taught, Liotard spent a great part of his life traveling, capturing the likenesses of Europe's upper classes with a steady and penetrating eye. His portraits, typically executed in chalk or pastel, exhibit a quasi-scientific clarity of observation more suggestive of Enlightenment curiosity than of Rococo artifice. In the present sheet attention is focused on the face, where a soft network of hatching in red and black chalk gently marks the topography of the sitter's features as revealed by the fall of light. The thoughtful yet formal pose, with eyes gazing evenly into the distance, conveys a calm authority. The identity of this handsome and self-assured man cannot be stated with certainty, though a tradition within the previous owner's records identified him as a member of the Andre family, bankers in Geneva and Paris. 33</page><page sequence="3">FranSois-Andre Vincent French, 1746-1816 Study for "Boreas Abducting Oreithyia" Ca. 1782 Red, black, and white chalk, with stumping 20 x 51/8 in. (50.8 x 39.I cm) Inscribed (lower right, in pen and brown ink): fait par Vincent, membre de l'institut Purchase, David T. Schiff Gift, and Harry G. Sperling and Louis V. Bell Funds, zooo 2000.37 This forceful sheet is a study for the central pose of Vincent's reception piece, the paint- ing he submitted to the Academie Royale in 1782 in order to gain the post of academician (Musee du Louvre, Paris; on deposit in Chambery). The abduction is described in Ovid's Metamorphoses (6.682-707). Boreas, the north wind, enamored of the maiden Oreithyia, daughter of King Erechtheus of Athens, becomes angry when his gentle entreaties fail and decides to resort instead to his characteristic brute force. The subject was a common one among Rococo artists; it had been treated by Boucher, Deshays, Natoire, and Pierre, among others. Vincent, however, was alone in evoking the stormy atmosphere and violence found in Ovid's version of the story. Using the trois crayons technique (which combines red, white, and black chalk), Vincent set forth the dramatic contrast he envisioned for the painting. The figures are drawn essen- tially in red chalk, with highlights in white that suggest a stark, milky light falling on Oreithyia; stumping in black chalk indicates shadow and the dark sky beyond. The detail of Oreithyia's left hand, emblematic of her resistance, is studied in the lower part of the sheet with great clarity, as if it were carved in marble. PS Pierre-Paul Prud'hon French, I758-1823 Andromache andAstyanax Ca. 1798 Pen and gray ink, with brush and brown wash, over traces of black chalk, on laidpaper I 34 x 85/8 in. (29.8 x 21.9 cm) Harry G. Sperling Fund, 1999 9999.348 Prud'hon depicted Andromache several times, perhaps most notably in the Metro- politan's painting Andromache and Astyanax (acc. no. 25.IO.I4), which was unfinished at the time of his death but completed soon afterward by his student Boisfremont. The Museum's new drawing was probably among the earliest of Prud'hon's treatments of the scene in which the heroine of Racine's drama (based on Greek legend) discovers in her young son's face the visage of her dead spouse, Hector. At that moment she declares, "C'est toi, cher epoux, que j'embrasse" (It is you, dear husband, whom I embrace). Although he is better known for works in black and white chalk, in this instance Prud'hon drew in pen and ink. He prepared the drawing to be engraved as an illustration for Didot's lavish edition of Racine, pub- lished between I803 and I805. Prud'hon proudly displayed the sheet at the Salon of 1798 but lost the Didot commission none- theless to the painter Girodet, largely owing to the intervention of the Neoclassicist master David, who vigorously promoted the interests of his own students.

Other sketches by Gericault now in the Mus&amp;e du Louvre, Paris, and the Mus&amp;e Bonnat, Bayonne, show tiny figures dragging boats and are probably connected with this project. Two more drawings, in the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Mus&amp;e des Beaux-Arts, Dijon, are also related.

(4.9 x 43.8 cm) Wrightsman Fund, ooo2000 2000.5I Friedrich is universally acclaimed as Germany's greatest Romantic painter, but his pictures are rarely seen outside his native country. This fine canvas, executed at midcareer, is the first of his works to enter the Museum's col- lection. It is the second of three memorable paintings that show pensive figures contem- plating the rising moon; the other variants are at Dresden and Berlin. In this version Friedrich depicted him- self-wearing the old-fashioned garb adopted by those opposed to Metternich's policies- with his favorite student, August Heinrich (I794-I822), who had recently died while on his way to Italy. It is thought that Friedrich painted this picture in remembrance of their evening walks together in the mountains outside Dresden. In the vast literature on Friedrich, the fir, the gnarled oak, and the rising moon have been given numerous interpretations, rooted in Christianity or, alternatively, in paganism.

(25.2 x 35.7 cm) Purchase, Jennifer and Joseph Duke and Lila Acheson Wallace Gifts, 1999 2000.I3 The Forest of Fontainebleau-forty thousand acres crisscrossed by footpaths and dotted with ancient oaks and anthropomorphic boulders-attracted a new generation of painters in the second quarter of the nine- teenth century. Corot, Daubigny, Theodore Rousseau, and others found in the light- dappled woods south of Paris both a spiritual antidote for the tensions of modern urban life and a perfect subject for exploring the physical and expressive properties of their medium, free of academic strictures. Working alongside these pre-Impressionist painters and testing the limits of another medium was Le Gray, a young artist who had recently traded in his paint box and easel for a camera and tripod. In this early work, a unique print for- merly in the famed Jammes collection, Paris, Le Gray sought to convey the sensuous expe- rience of the sylvan interior. Rather than providing an inventory of precise details, Le Gray's waxed paper negative (a process he invented) translated the observable world into a painterly evocation of light, texture, and atmosphere. Here, the lacy network of branches, patches of lichen, and sparkling vegetation are woven into a tapestry of allover patterning-like a Jackson Pollock paint- ing-which merges solid and void, substance and shadow.

(129.5 cm) Purchase, Clara Mertens Bequest, in memory of Andre Mertens, I999 I999.307a, b In I787, five years after Porthaux went into business, the composer and renowned bas- soonist of his time, Etienne Ozi, furthered the maker's career by recommending his instruments in an instruction book entitled Methode nouvelle et raisonnee pour le basson. This example features six keys, including a speaker key, which came into use soon after I800 to facilitate the "speaking" of the high- est notes. Its bearing arrangement is unusual in that the keys are tucked over an oblong socket in the wood instead of having metal capsules. The bassoon was acquired with its original extra wing joint (for lower pitch) and original bocal (curved metal tube), as well as two boxes of period reeds. The survival of such a complete set in its original case is rare. Porthaux's bassoon foreshadowed what later in the nineteenth century came to be called the French, as opposed to the German, bassoon, featuring a colorful, slender, and slightly nasal sound; long tenons; characteris- tic key flaps; and a particular turning profile of the bell section. HH Doreck arrived in Mannheim in 1821 from Brunn, Austria. A label in the traveling case of our cup states that he established a work- shop as goldsmith and jeweler in the town's center, at "No. 5 / in der breiten Strasse." Here, the master took a simple Neoclassical barrel form and enlivened it with a playful contrast of decorative details and surface effects, such as the light-catching gadroons. The perfectly preserved cup may have been a present to a physician, as indicated by the applied reliefs of Hygeia, the Greek goddess of health, and her father, Asclepius, the god of medicine and healing. It is part of a long evolution of presentation cups from ancient times to the sport and racing trophies of today.

As the name indicates, it was designed to play solos. It represents the first French version of the valve horn, invented by Heinrich Stolzel in Germany in I814. In 1827 Antoine worked with Pierre-Joseph- Emile Meifred, horn player for the Theatre Italien and the Opera in Paris, to improve the German model. None of the early examples have survived, but the cor Meifred, as this horn was also dubbed in France, continued to be manufactured there as late as the I85os. The horn was executed in "high pitch," which was just beginning to be superseded by the "low pitch" standard of 435 hertz-soon universal. Thus the instrument was little played and has remained in excellent condi- tion. Antoine, who in I825 had become pro- prietor of the renowned instrument-making firm of Jean Hilaire Halari-Aste, signed the horn on the bell "HALARI-ANTOINE BREVETE RUE MAZARINE A PARIS.

Here, he vies with his Neoclassical contemporaries in painting by presenting a tender vignette, using hints of costume and posture to define the generations: the burly man at right, in a fashionable high collar, has dismounted, still wearing his spurs, to be greeted by his wife, their four children, and an older man-his father or hers, or perhaps a tutor. Bewigged and taking a pinch of snuff, the latter adheres to a bygone style of life, which Renaud, a die- hard royalist, surely savored. The modeling of wax in relief on a slate ground had been a preliminary technique of medalists since the Renaissance, but Renaud used it as an end in itself, confident that the pleasing contrasts of color and tex- ture achieved in this miniature would cause it to be framed and treasured as a keepsake.

Rorimer, by exchange, and funds from various donors, zooo 2000.I44a, b In the mid-Victorian era there was great interest in the decorative styles of the six- teenth century, which is reflected in many fields and even in women's fashions. The leading firm of Mintons made copies of the rare sixteenth-century French court ceramics then known as "Henri II" ware. Such copies were first produced by Leon Arnoux, the factory's French art director. In the late i86os Toft, a member of a line of prominent seventeenth-century potters, turned out exact reproductions at Mintons of sixteenth- century models, with dark clay ornament inlaid on a white body-the equivalent of niello on silver-and also larger, original works. The latter, very much to contempo- rary taste in form, utilized a second technique practiced at the "Henri II" workshop, now almost universally recognized as having been at Saint-Porchaire, a village in Poitou. This second technique consisted of paint- ing on the surface of the white body with colored stains, which were then given bril- liance by a clear lead glaze. While the shape of this potpourri is orientalizing, the symmet- rical decoration is taken with little adaptation from Saint-Porchaire originals, including the repeated H around the foot, a reference to the king found on numerous pieces of the earlier period.

Here, in a radical de- parture both from his own manner and from the prevailing taste of the period, he let the suavely curved profiles speak for themselves, emphasizing them through the use of a single allover trellis and flower-head pattern, adjusted in scale and rhythm to each change of surface. Combining traditional and new techniques, Froment-Meurice introduced both chromatic and textural variety through chasing, engraving, and electroplated gilding in two colors-yellow and greenish white gold-on a ground that had been partly polished and partly acid etched. Froment-Meurice frequently repeated his models, and this ensemble is one of three known versions. It was perhaps an experimen- tal design made for stock, as the unidentified cipher set into the handle is of a different color gold; this suggests that the cipher was inserted at the time of purchase.

I89 By about 1832 new production methods and a broad range of new colors enabled Berlin's porcelain factory to create objects of excep- tional size and brilliance. Even so, tables made entirely of porcelain are rare, and this is 40</page><page sequence="10">the only Berlin example known to survive. The monochromatic pedestal, its refined gild- ing simulating metalwork, is composed of porcelain sections slipped over a thin metal rod and provides stately support for the daz- zling polychromy of the top. Within a central medallion Apollo drives his chariot amid the constellations, a scene framed by signs of the zodiac. Encircling this are two luxuriant wreaths, the inner of fruits and vegetables and the outer of glossy leaves alive with dart- ing insects. The entire table may have been designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel (I78I-184I), the versatile architect who created both furniture and porcelain for the Berlin factory. The impetus for such virtuoso pieces came from the Prussian king Frederick William III, whose patronage of the royal manufactory was extensive. We are not cer- tain that he commissioned this table, but on June I, I835, it was recorded as a gift from him to Grand Duchess Helena Pavlovna of Russia (I807-I873).

Here, Boudin takes her at her word, devoting a scrap of board to capturing the effect of her voluminous skirts billowing in the gusts of the Norman shore. Boudin achieved success with his scenes of fashionably dressed families taking the air at Trouville and other beach resorts, and apart from Empress Eugenie, no woman would have aroused more interest on the beach than Princess Metternich. A close friend of the empress, she became the face of fashion in Second Empire Paris. According to the acid- tongued Goncourt brothers, she was ubiqui- tous: "Her, always her! In the street, at the Casino, at Trouville, at Deauville, on foot, in a carriage, on the beach, at children's parties, at balls for important people, always and everywhere, this monster ... who has only the elegance that she can buy from the dressmaker for one hundred thousand francs a year."

Besides, Corot modeled every tree trunk with the same devotion and love as if it were a figure." 42</page><page sequence="12">Perhaps it would be better to say that Corot painted people with the same devotion as he gave to trees, for in his figures one also finds the quiet absorption and unaffected grace- what the French critics called naivete-with which he imbued his landscapes. Although Corot had always made figure studies, at the end of his life he painted a large number of genre scenes destined for eager collectors. His friends recalled that he looked forward to them as a refreshing holiday from rou- tine. Here, the girl closely resembles Emma Dobigny, who later became one of his favorite models. Like most of Corot's figure paintings, this work was not exhibited during his life. The title, which directs our attention to what might lie beyond the wall, was probably assigned later, perhaps by the first owner, Corot's stu- dent George Camus. Corot gave the picture to Camus in February 1864, when Dobigny would have been thirteen years old. Edouard Manet French, I832-I883 The "Kearsarge" at Boulogne 1864 Oil on canvas 3278 X 39/8 in.

The Federal corvette Kearsarge sank the Confederate ship Alabama near Cherbourg on June 19, 1864. Manet, a former sailor, was captivated by the reports in the Parisian press and rushed a painting of the battle (now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art) to a dealer's window. A few weeks later, during his habitual summer vacation at Boulogne, Manet was keen to see the victori- ous ship, which was being provisioned and repaired. He wrote a friend: "The Kearsage [sic] was anchored at Boulogne last Sunday. I went to have a look. I had got it about right. So then I painted her as she looked on the water. Judge for yourself." This picture is the result. It is the first in a series of seascapes that would profoundly affect the course of French painting. Here, Manet introduced several pictorial devices- the bird's-eye perspective, the reduction of sea and sky to flat, flaglike bands of color, and the boats' inky silhouettes-borrowed from Japanese woodblock prints, an art form that had only recently come to his attention. Monet quickly followed suit. Soon French critics would identify the founding of Impressionism with the assimilation of Japanese art into contemporary painting.

(8I.6 x 60 cm) The Walter H. and Leonore Annenberg Collection, Partial Gift of Walter H. and Leonore Annenberg, zooo 2000.93.1 Standing before the couple's rented house in Argenteuil, a short distance by train from Paris, Camille Monet (1847-1879) is little more than an accessory to a splendid mass of hollyhocks. Monet's love of gardening, fully expressed in. later life at his house and ponds at Giverny, became evident wherever the artist put down his roots. In summer 1874 he had rented the house shown here before con- struction was completed; hollyhocks planted at the end of that summer would not bloom in force until June or July 1876. This painting and related canvases thus commemorate the garden's first full flowering. Historians have determined that in front of his modest house, painted pink with green shutters, Monet installed a large central flower bed circled by a path. Gladioli, more hollyhocks, and underplantings of nasturtiums and geraniums filled the interstices of the rectangular plot. This audacious canvas displays the Impressionist technique that Monet had only recently perfected. In contrast to the fluid, Corot-like brushwork of his early pictures made at Argenteuil, here the paint is applied in dabs and licks, the entire surface animated by flickering light and bright local color. It was precisely this technique that Seurat systematized into pointillism. GT Claude Monet French, I840-1926 Jean Monet on His Hobby Horse 1872 Oil on canvas 23 4 X 283/4 in. (59. x 73 cm) Gift of Sara Lee Corporation, zooo 2000.I95 As a French journalist opined in the i86os, "Everyone in the middle class wants to have his little house with trees, roses, dahlias, his big or little garden, his rural argentea mediocritas." Previously the middle class had consisted of urban apartment dwellers and rural gentry, but the development of railroads under Louis-Philippe and their expansion under Napoleon III made possible a hitherto unknown suburban mode. This new phe- nomenon is perfectly illustrated by the life and work of Monet, who adopted bourgeois manners and aspirations long before he could afford them. Accordingly, Monet made his life in Argenteuil, an agreeable suburb of Paris, the stuff of his art. In this famous portrait of his five-year-old son, Jean (I867-I913), he was sure to display the boy's expensive tricycle and chic clothing, but his primary aim was to capture a likeness. He painted him with the deep-set-almost world-weary-eyes that his mother, Camille, also possessed. Here, Monet did not lavish his usual attention on brush- work, allowing the white canvas primer to show in the highlights, and he used a restrained and sophisticated harmony of tan, green, and red. This may be Monet's most ingratiating picture, but it is no less intelligent for all that.

For most of his career he was absorbed in the study of cozy interiors and the atmo- sphere exuded by their patterned wallpapers, drapes, and upholstery. Friends and family, who posed passively for the artist, were pictured in equilibrium with their household furnishings; bathed in indoor light, they often appear to dissolve into the decorative materials of their rooms. Domestic intimacy thus became a sonorous theme in Vuillard's art, as it and its converse, domestic estrangement, were in the plays of Ibsen and Strindberg, for which he designed stage sets and playbills. Into his own life, GT drama arrived in the rosy form of his sister's newborn baby. Little Annette can be seen here: the pink spot at the center of a nest of eiderdown and familial affection. CI Degas remained faithful to racing scenes throughout his long career, but he stepped up their production in the I88os. As with dancers in his ballet compositions, he manipu- lated a cast of horses and jockeys from one picture to the next, enlarging them, reversing them, or reducing them to fit the background. Indeed, all of the figures in this picture can be found in earlier works, and some of the poses have pedigrees even more distinguished than the horses' own: the prancing mount and rider at the center of the composition derive from Benozzo Gozzoli's Journey of the Magi (I459), which Degas copied in Florence in I859. But this work is quite unusual in one respect: Degas made it with pastel on a plain, unvarnished wood panel. With skillful econ- omy of means, he allowed the wood to color the sky and distant landscape-the suggestion of a village in Normandy-and to provide a warm undertone for the turf in the foreground. 46 \ . tw.

(25.4 x 17.8 cm) Signed (lower left, in pen and ink): G. Courbet; inscribed and dated (top, in pen and ink): Les Federes ala Conciergerie I871 Gift of Guy Wildenstein, 1999 1999.25I The intensity of Courbet's political views landed him in prison in I871. As a leading dissident of the liberal Paris Commune, he was held responsible for the destruction of the Vendome column and was locked up in the stables of Versailles. Later, he was sen- tenced to six months at the prison of Sainte- Pelagie in Paris. To judge from an attached inscription, Courbet must have been at Versailles when he made this drawing of fellow jailed Communards; he sent it to the magazine L 'autographe, where it was published. The artist evidently wished to emphasize that among those held under dreadful, terrifying conditions were juveniles, some scarcely more than infants. Courbet's gritty illustration shows a graffiti-marked prison cell in which a boy, slumped on the stone floor, and a child crying on a bed direct their hopes toward the barred window. With so few drawings to his name, Courbet remains an elusive draftsman. Although the Museum owns twenty-six of his paintings, this is only our second drawing. Very differ- ent in function and appearance from the academic study of a nude male in the Robert Lehman Collection (acc. no. 1975.1.589), this work gives vent to the artist's anger and mis- ery when he was only months away from exile in Switzerland. cI Taxile Maximin Doat French, 1851-1938 Bottle Sevres (Doat atelier), ca. 1902 Stoneware and hard-paste porcelain H. 92 in. (24.1 cm) Signed: TDOAT [with interlocking T and D] Sevres Bequest of Robert Louis Isaacson, 1998 1999.179a, b Doat was among the earliest ceramists to use pate-sur-pate, the technique of creating translucent low-relief compositions from lay- ers of porcelain slip. First produced at Sevres in 1849, it became a central feature of Doat's work, both at the national manufactory, where he was employed from 1877 to 1905, and in his own atelier nearby, the Villa Kaolin. Uninterested in the current fashion for japonisme, Doat chose allegorical or whimsical subjects, frequently setting them as plaques on a stoneware body, the sheen of the porcelain contrasting effectively with the rougher texture of the ground. On this bottle two oblong plaques depict children picking grapes and apples, while a wineglass and cider jug are seen in medallions below the handles. As if to emphasize the peasant-flask character of the model, the plaques have been attached to the body by porcelain thongs. This is one of three known examples of the model; one, now in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris, was exhibited in 1902 with the title "Champagne et Normandie." CLC 47</page></plain_text>
