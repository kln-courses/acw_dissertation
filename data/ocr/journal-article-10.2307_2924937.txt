Mr. Nolte calls his book a "partisan" study of Jeffers-"a passionate defense of the last great narrative poet of our time." The book is always challenging, often illuminating, sometimes irritating, but never dull. Per-</page><page sequence="2">I26 American Literature haps this is to be expected of any good book about Jeffers, but it may also result from an uncertainty of intention. "I shall concern myself very little with critics," Mr. Nolte writes, "or with influences; I shall be concerned almost solely with the meaning of various of Jeffers's poems." But in the process he attacks many critics, describes Jeffers's meaning by contrast with writers who have influenced him (especially Neitzsche), and seldom defines this meaning in direct, logical terms. Take, for instance, his title phrase, "The Romantic Agony." We all know vaguely what this means, but Mr. Nolte never clearly defines it, nor even mentions Mario Praz, or his excellent book of that title. Rather, he describes various aspects of Neitzsche and others which he calls "ro- mantic," and shows how Jeffers shared some of these, but rejected others. Nevertheless he denounces those who have called Jeffers a "post-romantic," because Jeffers rejected the anthropomorphism which they shared. If I interpret him aright, Mr. Nolte argues that Jeffers shared the romantic agony,'" but not the "romantic" world-view of the earlier authors. His primary title, "Rock and Hawk," suggests the more concrete aspects of his book. He discusses most of Jeffers's best poems, both in terms of symbolic and of explicit meaning. His critical insights are often exciting, especially, for instance, his interpretation of the character of Onorio Vasquez, the dreamer, who appears in several narrative poems. No earlier critic has come to grips with the problem of Jeffers's wartime poems, particularly the masque, "The Bowl of Blood." Mr. Nolte shows how this attempt to "distance" the character of Hitler, so that he can be understood in historical terms, sometimes succeeds brilliantly. But when he scornfully dismisses the arguments of those who have called Jeffers a "protofascist" as "absurd," his partisanship shows. Back in I939 the late Newton Arvin so described Jeffers, and I took issue with him. After sev- eral letters and a fresh definition of terms, Arvin convinced me of the rea- sonableness of his arguments. Now I welcome the counter-statements of Mr. Nolte, but decry his name-calling. And if "The Bowl of Blood" suc- ceeds as a "masque," I believe that it fails as poetry because it is too prosy. A masque, after all, is a very artificial art-form; and as Mr. Nolte knows, Jeffers's poetry is at its best when it is most natural. Walnut Creek, California. FREDERIC I.
