This article brings to light the case of Brazil, where recently passed federal legislation has authorized research with in vitro human embryos. It focuses on the legislative debate in the Brazilian National Congress between 2003 and 2005 on the Biosafety Bill of Law, which cleared for hESC research a certain share of supernumerary and unviable human embryos frozen in the country's assisted reproduction clinics.The passing of this Bill triggered other public reactions, chiefly a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality in Brazil's Federal Supreme Court. This study adopts an anthropological perspective for describing and analyzing the chief arguments in both debates, in terms of how the notion of life' was deployed and negotiated by contending parties. If, on the one hand, the definition of life appeared firmly attached to a conception of both the in vitro embryo and the fetus as a human person, on the other a movement towards breaking down life along utilitarian lines was found when the potential beneficiaries of stem cell therapy came into the equation. In all cases, however, notions of life were negotiated from a hybrid continuum of (biological) facts and (religious, moral and juridical) values, and resonated in different ways with the idea of the individual as privileged mode of constructing personhood in the context of modern nation states.

In March 2005, after 17 months of heated public debate, the Brazilian National Congress passed a Bill regulating the use of human embryos in research. This piece of legislation, clearing for research a limited share of supernumerary in vitro embryos, was subsequently challenged in the Federal Supreme Court, and a final decision upholding the Law was issued in May 2008. Like other cases worldwide, the Brazilian hESC debate concerns the emergence of the human embryo as a new kind of entity in the public sphere, whose legal framing tends to operate along the lines of what Marilyn Strathern (1992) has termed a partitioned process, that is, on the murky interface between the natural and the social, in which '[biological] facts ... [become] simultaneously the ground for argument and the subject of interpretation' (p. 141). This study departs from the ways the notion of life appeared in discourses uttered a propos the two stages of the institutional debate in Brazil, as well as from its interplay with neighboring notions such as human, person, and subject/object. It analyzes documental and stenographic material from the Brazilian Congress' House and Senate as well as from the Federal Supreme Court. For both the Legislative and the Judiciary, the inquiry encompasses internal discussions as well as public hearings with experts. The analyses of such official forums were complemented by a review of press material covering the polemic.1 While passing through the Brazilian legislature starting in October 2003, the Biosafety Bill of Law, originally devised to regulate research and trade of genetically modified organisms, came to include an article establishing rules for the use of human embryos in stem cell research - as will be detailed below, this was a response to pressure from part of the scientific community fearful of possible restrictions to this kind of activity implicit in previous legislation. In its final version, the Fifth Article authorized, for purposes of research and therapy, the deployment of hESC harvested from non-viable in vitro embryos, or from frozen embryos stored in in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics for more than 3 years. In all cases, consent by the genitors was required, and research projects were to be submitted to the respective institutions' ethics committees. This outcome triggered manifold public reactions, the most prominent of which was a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality ( Agao Direta de Inconstitucionalidade (ADI)) in Brazil's Federal Supreme Court. This ADI was filed on 16 May 2005 by the then Attorney-General of the Republic Claudio Fonteles, who questioned the constitutionality of the Fifth Article on the grounds that it harmed fundamental guarantes: the right to life and the dignity of the human person. In both institutional arenas, opposing groups clustered, on the one hand, around Christian advocates of embryos' rights and, on the other, organized patient groups and scientists interested in pursuing hESC research. Even though the two sides employed different assumptions about when life begins, both claimed to be defending life itself: in one case, the right of embryos to life after conception, and in the other, the right of science to search for ways to preserve or improve ailing patients' lives and/or quality of life. In this highly contested battleground, where scientific authority alone was incapable of establishing definite ontological boundaries for its research objects - in fact, where the very notion of object (and therefore subject) was at stake - previously stable notions</page><page sequence="3">Cesarino and Luna 229 such as life, humanness, and personhood were subjected to myriad re-framings and re-deployments. In contrast to the British 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (HFEA), where some stabilization was eventually achieved based on scientific arguments (most prominently under the category 'pre-embryo') (Mulkay, 1997), in Brazil much of the ambiguity remained until the end. It is this unsteady terrain that the present study aims to map out and interpret in the case of the Brazilian Biosafety Bill, chiefly through the lenses of anthropological literature on personhood and modern individualism. Marcel Mauss's (1985) classic piece on 'the notion of person' inaugu- rated anthropological research on different modes of constructing personhood, among them the modern individual. Durkheim (1969) had already pointed to the historicity (and therefore specificity) of this idea, and Louis Dumont (1986) made of the indi- vidualistic revolution' in Europe the cornerstone of his analysis of Western modernity. More recently, Strathern (1988) has approached the subject from the standpoint of her ethnographic experience, with alternative notions of personhood in Melanesia - most famously, the 'dividual' person - and brought her insights about relations making up persons to bear on contemporary debates about the embryo's status and the new repro- ductive technologies (Strathern, 1992, 1999). From an anthropological perspective, thus, to discuss personhood in relation to the embryo debate is to probe into the ways the nature-culture divide is being itself carved out or bridged, and subject-object positions reshuffled. The 2003-2005 legislative debate The Biosafety Bill's original draft was completed by the Executive Branch in October 2003, during President Lula's first year in office. The events that had initially pushed for a new regulatory framework for biosafety had little to do with embryo research: the Bill was intended as a remedy for years of judicial deadlock concerning the legitimacy of the first commercial release license granted for a transgenic organism in Brazil, Monsanto 's Roundup Ready soybean. A swift and definite solution was badly needed: the transgenic soy was already being illegally smuggled from Argentina into Brazil, since at least 1998, and was rapidly spreading. The government draft was built upon the existing 1995 Biosafety Law, which included an article outlawing the 'production, storage or manipulation of human embryos destined to be used as available biological material' (Article 6). This provision, although periph- eral in the body of the biosafety legislation, served as a pretext for reviving a latent debate on hESC research in the Brazilian National Congress. Scientists were concerned that the enactment of this article would hinder research in the field, and then got together to lobby for its modification.2 The first reporter of the Bill and government leader in the Chamber of Deputies, Aldo Rebelo, was sympathetic to the appeals and removed the article alto- gether from his draft. However, by simply removing the ban, Rebelo did not specify what would be allowed, therefore leaving the door open to even more controversial practices such as human cloning. This prospect led to a temporary alliance between Catholics and Evangelicals in the National Congress, whose reaction to Rebelo 's draft was immediate. Evangelical Congressmen from various denominations were formally assembled in an influential legislative caucus in Congress, especially in its lower chamber.3 As for the Catholics,</page><page sequence="4">230 Social Studies of Science 41(2) even though the Church's top leadership in Brazil, the National Confederation of Brazilian Bishops (CNBB), did not fail to work behind the scenes to block embryo research, an informal group of a few dozen Catholic Congressmen coalesced in the Chamber of Deputies. Although not so numerous, votes by those aligned with the Catholic Church's official doctrine against the Fifth Article would ultimately prove more unitary and reliable than their Evangelical counterparts' more 'segmentary' voting behavior (Oro, 2005). Christian Congressmen's combative attitude towards the use of human embryos in stem cell research - the outgrowth of a stance crystallized by years of debate around abortion regulations4 - was fundamentally grounded in the thesis of the beginning of life at conception. The main scriptural reference cited in the legislative debates was Psalm 139:15-16: My frame was not hidden from you / when I was made in the secret place. / When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, / your eyes saw my unformed body. / All the days ordained for me / were written in your book / before one of them came to be. It is evident how this notion of universal predetermination is linked to the fertilization landmark, and even to earlier stages in the reproductive cycle. In particular, Christian Congressmen associated the phrase 'my unformed body' directly with the early embryo. Christians, however, not only based their arguments on doctrine, but also claimed that their stance expressed the will of the (Catholic) majority in Brazil. Although the biological counterpart of the religious argument, that is, the beginning of life at fertilization, was not especially privileged in Christian representatives' claims against the Fifth Article, it did appear in the House debates, especially after the Bill returned from the Senate to the Chamber of Deputies for a final vote in March 2005. Salvador Zimbaldi, one of the most vocal anti-hESC Congressmen, not only deployed the familiar life-at-fertilization argument, but also that of the embryo as universal ancestor (also see Franklin, 1999): When does life begin? Life begins exactly at the moment when the female and male gametes meet. From then on, there is life. Each of you, ladies and gentlemen, was once an embryo. In order to become what you are today, you have been through an embryonic moment. (2 March 2005) Taking advantage of their political and numerical clout in the lower chamber, these reli- gious groups were able to successfully strike a deal with the next Reporter of the Bill in the house, Rebelo's co-religionist Renildo Calheiros. Calheiros ended up reintroducing the original ban against any kind of embryo research into the deputies' final draft before it moved on to the Federal Senate. From that point on, the embryo research polemic became amplified in the Parliament and in the media, and slowly outgrew the initial concern with transgenics, to the extent that, a year and a half later, a Bill of Law that had been originally devised to solve the urgent Roundup Ready question left the National Congress as the law that cleared human embryos for research in Brazil! The insistence in</page><page sequence="5">Cesarino and Luna 23 1 keeping the two issues tied up in the same piece of legislation, however, had its own strategic logic: those pushing for the two biotechnologies reckoned that more permis- sive regulations for both stood a better chance of being passed if they ran together in the same Bill. Supporters of genetically modified organisms (GMO) soon realized that the fierce polemics involving embryo research tended to overshadow their own controversy in the public's view, whereas hESC research advocates benefited from the extreme urgency animating the legislative debate over a new rule for transgenics in Brazil. The pro-research lobby was mostly made up of scientists interested in experimenting with hESC, along with more or less organized patient groups, whose members suffered from illnesses and disabilities they believed were potentially treatable with the new therapy. After being overwhelmed by the Christian deputies, this interest group took advantage of the change in forum to gather forces in order to reverse that negative outcome. Their effort could not be timid: if the Bill was changed in the Senate, it would still have to return to the Chamber of Deputies for a final vote. Once in the Senate, the Bill was subjected to expert consultation on the issue of embryo research. Thus, a public hearing was called for on 2 June 2004, when a handful of scientists spoke to a large audience of Senators and other representatives. In contrast to the lingering dispute around the transgenics, a legislative solution for the embryo research polemic was achieved with relative celerity in the Senate. In the aftermath of the experts' hearing, the compromise that was to be ultimately incorporated in the final version of the Bill was successfully woven together by a core group of Senators. Given the relative ease with which Rebelo's draft excluding the embryo research ban had been overturned in the Chamber of Deputies, such smooth passage demands explana- tion. Various factors - not all of them discursive, for sure - certainly contributed to it, but it seems reasonable to suggest that the experts' participation was in fact central for changing hearts and minds in the Senate. Part of their influence had to do with a suc- cessful reshaping of the way the issue of 'life' was approached. Interestingly, no Christian 'expert' was invited to speak in the Senate hearing, even though the only participant condemning embryo research, Andre Soares, was a bioethics professor at a Catholic University and had ties with CNBB. As will be seen below, this would change when the matter moved on to the Federal Supreme Court. But at the time the Bill was going through Congress, the Christians' stance was mostly taken for granted as a clearly defined moral standing - and correspondingly bashed by many of their opponents in Congress as obscurantism and witch-hunt.5 In the words of one of the main mediators of the deal stricken around the Fifth Article, Senator Tiao Viana, 4 CNBB has a clear, well-structured and irremovable concept of life, [whereas] science struggles with various concepts' (Federal Senate, 6 October 2004). Given the acknowledged impossibility of a conceptual convergence between the con- tending parties, a pragmatic compromise was sought - which was why the proposal to use supernumerary embryos was so appealing. The persistent question raised by experts in the hearing was: if such embryos are inevitably headed to the 'trash can', why not re- channel them to the noble and humanistic ends of science? This idea was on the table from the beginning, but it was only taken seriously in the Senate, especially after the August public hearing. Most Senators grasped the opportunity of a middle-ground</page><page sequence="6">232 Social Studies of Science 41(2) solution - supposedly a provisional one that would allow them to avoid having to reach a consensus on the contentious question of the beginning of life. In order to incorporate scientific and moral legitimacy to their claims, however, experts did have to implicitly redefine 'life' to fit their pragmatic equation. Indeed, the four pro-hESC research scientists who spoke to the Senators avoided tack- ling directly the question of the embryo status, or when life begins. Instead, they strove to lay a ground of inevitability from which the pragmatic compromise could be reached. They did it, first, by convincing representatives that there was no feasible way to prevent the disposal of spare frozen embryos in Brazil's in IVF clinics. Second, that the underly- ing scientific uncertainty about the embryo's status was intractable, so that consensus about the beginning of life would be unattainable. And third, they struggled to narrow the debate's focus from the broader, metaphysical question of the beginning life to the more concrete (though only potential) benefits of hESC research. The latter included not only humanitarian motives, such as therapeutic possibilities to be made available for 'poorer Brazilians', but also more mundane economic benefits to be realized in the form of patents for national science, or more vaguely, as national progress and development. Underpinning the fait accompli of embryo disposal was a picture of assisted reproduc- tion in Brazil as a domain of lawlessness. At the time (and this still holds true today), the country had no specific federal regulations for assisted reproduction. Although the National Medical Council's Resolution bearing on the issue proscribed the disposal of human embryos, given the lack of enforceable legislation preventing it, many clinics reportedly resorted to such practice on a regular basis. Dr Drauzio Varella, an oncologist, writer, and well-known figure in the Brazilian media, assured his audience that 'there is no control of these leftover embryos. No one knows what happens to them.' Dr Marco Antonio Zago, a prominent medical scientist actively involved in science policy, also asserted that disposal was 'their inexorable destiny'. The question that followed, as expressed by Dr Patricia Pranke, a stem cell researcher at a public university, was: 'Why not give them a nobler destiny, that is, allow them to save other lives? It is Utopian to think that these embiyos will remain frozen forever.' The pragmatic proposal of 'recycling' embryos inevitably destined for the 'trash can', however, could not completely evade the metaphysical debate. Ultimately, it could only be legitimately sustained over a firm background of scientific uncertainty able to render obsolete the ontological issue of life's beginning. Again, Dr Pranke presented this reasoning clearly: 'Instead of discussing if [the embryo] has life or not, we should decide on an immediate problem: what to do with the embryos frozen in IVF clinics.' Accordingly, the experts' rhetorical efforts were focused in part on the impossibility of assigning a clear-cut, consensual moment for defining the beginning of life. Multiple biological landmarks were raised, all with different implications for embryo personhood (or the lack thereof). The argument that implantation in the uterus is a necessary condi- tion for further development - a requirement frozen embryos obviously lack - was often stressed. According to this reasoning, trapped in the tank, the unwanted in vitro embryo has its potential for life hampered, perhaps forever. From this perspective, life is a poten- tial that can only be actualized in the human uterus, and not in the Petri dish. Dr Pranke strongly insisted in this point, explaining that the blastocyst stage in which stem cells are</page><page sequence="7">Cesarino and Luna 233 harvested (4 or 5 days after fertilization) 4 is not the natural phase in which [the embryos] would be implanted in the womb'. She also explored legal contradictions such as the lawfulness, in Brazil, of contraceptive measures such as intra-uterine devices that prevent the implantation of the fertilized egg. Moreover, during the hearing, this emphasis on the extra-uteral character of the in vitro embryo was often accompanied by anthropomorphic arguments depriving it of personhood. The blastocyst was recurrently referred to as fca bunch of cells', and hESC research itself as a mere outgrowth of tissue culture techniques. Even the British category of the pre-embryo was deployed, although without much success. As will be seen below, in the Supreme Court arguments about the uterus would be further refined, and indeed they became pivotal for distinguishing between the embryo's potentiality and viability. Besides the uterus, other biological traits were explored, which related not so much to the embryo's viability, as to developmental changes challenging the fertilization thesis. Of these landmarks, possibly the one most often explored in the hearing was the develop- ment of the primitive streak on the 14th day. This is not surprising, given the strong analogies at that stage between the morphological and functional events and the attribute of individuality: when the primitive streak starts forming, the embryo can no longer split in two or fuse with another; the group of cells that form the fetus is separated from those that form the embryonic annexes. This also has been a strong line of argument in other debates about embryo research, such as the now paradigmatic British HFEA (Mulkay, 1997; Strathern, 1992). The Brazilian experts also extensively deployed the 'nervous system' criterion. Although this landmark is no more consensual among scientists - spanning from about 8 weeks, if the focus is on the appearance of the first nervous signals, up to 20 months, if stress is on the completion of the nervous system proper - it is used commonly in debates about the beginning of life (Kaufman and Morgan, 2005). This argument's persuasive appeal may be related to the fact that it directly mirrors brain death - in Brazil, a landmark already backed by law on organ transplants. In this case, the twin attributes of life and personhood are conditioned to the presence of a biological blueprint for a rational being. Reason, the metaphysical foundation of modern subjectivity, and the clinical criterion of consciousness thus appear conflated as a metaphysical-biological attribute defining both the beginning and end of life. Though they differ, all these lines of argument deployed by hESC research advocates coexisted with an underlying assumption that life is less of a bounded essence than a continuous flow. It was common in the hearing for a same expert to use two or more scientific theses for the beginning of life without any acknowledgment of self-contradiction. Some of them explicitly framed this assumption in terms of gradualism (Strathern, 1992). From their perspective, no matter which landmark is chosen, it will be an artificially (and therefore arbitrarily) discrete line imposed on a process that is naturally (and therefore necessarily) continuous. Whenever a biological argumentation expressed this assumption, it tended to be more explicitly coupled with moral positions. Dr May ana Zatz, a leading public advocate of hESC research in Brazil, provided an exemplary statement:</page><page sequence="8">234 Social Studies of Science 41(2) Many scientists think life has no beginning nor end, that life is a cycle. So ... if we keep the embryo frozen, ... if we don't use it, the cycle comes to a halt. If we use this embryo's cells to save a life, we'll be resuming the cycle of life. This kind of contention, pivotal to the ultimate success of the pragmatic compromise, is based on two assumptions about life that are worth underscoring. On the one hand, this portrayal of the biological cycle of life remarkably (and perhaps strategically) fails to acknowledge death as part of that cycle. On the other hand, it defines life as something fundamentally interchangeable across individual organisms. An essentialist notion of life is thus broken down into a quality - vitality - that can be shared by, or transferred to and from, different living beings. This is where the connection with the potential benefits of stem cell therapy was most strongly and persuasively established. The roots of the idea of life as continuity in ontogenesis (that is, individual development) can be traced at least as far back as Aristotle's vitalism (Franklin, 1995). The underlying biological connectivity of all living beings, however, was only acknowledged by modern science with the advent of Darwin's theory of evolution, and further reinforced by tech- nological developments with hybrid cells and recombinant DNA (Landecker, 2007). HESC technology makes its way into this history as a productive - and, so it is hoped, profitable (Waldby, 2002) - way to transfer vitality from one type of living human entity (a blastocyst) to another (a patient). As was the case in the British debate (Strathern, 1992: 21), in Brazil there generally was no argument against treating the embryo as alive as well as human. The point was whether it was a life and a human person - an individual (that is, non-divisible) entity. In order to legitimate the transfer of stem cells - a generative source of vitality - from the early embryo to patients, any essentialist notion of life - either conceived in biological or moral terms - had to be fundamentally challenged. By advancing a gradualist notion of life and tapping into the lack of moral and scientific consensus about its beginning, Brazilian experts were therefore able to lend credence to the idea that blastocysts are interchangeable with patients. However, the fact that an inevitable outcome of stem cell harvesting was the death of the embryo also demanded a complementary argument about a hierarchy of degrees of humanness. In this case, a hybrid biological-moral scale was established in which potential patients ranked higher than blastocysts - and, less explicitly, where both ranked lower than the functionally able and structurally complete, healthy, and long-lived indi- vidual. In other words, the vitalities of embryos and patients were to be conflated in order to fulfill a norm , which is itself at once social and biological, cultural and natural (Canguilhem, 2000). This norm, again, had strong pragmatic and individualized appeal to the experts' audience of legislators and their constituencies. This is precisely what was explored by scientists in the hearing. Dr Pranke, for instance, showed the Senators a series of slides of blastocysts, chronically ill/disabled children, and healthy children, while asking: 'Can we compare the life of this [disabled] child with the life of this cell? ... Is there any connotation of human life in these cells? This is precisely the blastocyst, with which we wish to work. ' Interestingly, she wrapped up her lecture claiming to speak 'not as a scientist, but as a Brazilian citizen who believes in God. Jesus said: "I have come so that you have life in abundance." Does a child in a wheelchair have life in abundance? What hope does she have?'</page><page sequence="9">Cesarino and Luna 235 The possibilities expressed here of quantifying life ('life in abundance ... '), grading it, comparing it, ranking it, and finally transferring it, stand in sharp contrast with the Catholic Church's official doctrine of life as an absolute, unmovable gift. The other side of the coin of such de-essentialization of life is its affinity with the utilitarian reasoning underlying the presumed trade-off between blastocysts and patients. That the former ultimately became means and the latter, ends, implies that their relative subject positions were redefined from being stages in a continuous cycle of life, to being placed on different sides of an object/subject dichotomy: the early embryo was objectified and pushed to the realm of nature relative to the patients, who retained full subject status. Even though the argument for using supernumerary embryos aimed less at an ulti- mate legal definition of their status than at a provisional solution until more permanent legislation was passed, for some of those who held a more essentialist view on the subject, this argument carried eugenic overtones. For example, in the public hearing, claims that disabled people would have 'less of a life' were overtly contested by a senator who worked closely with such a constituency. Others echoed the slippery slope metaphor noted by Mulkay (1997: 148-149) for Britain. But for most, the pragmatic argument for using 'spare' embryos seemed to be a reasonable solution, given the incommensurability of the views held by the most interested parties. The utilitarian- pragmatic solution was therefore not regarded as impinging directly on the moral and ethical - and even the formal scientific - problem: it stood beyond them. The impact of the experts' arguments on the legislative fate of the Fifth Article cannot be underestimated. Their presentations were followed by statements by leading senators enthralled with the by now 'self-evident' solution furnished by their guest speakers. They were able, virtually in one stroke, to provide legislators with a safe rationale for the hith- erto anguished contradiction between acknowledging life in the embryo and yet allowing it to be sacrificed as a research object. Senator Helio Costa epitomized the general feel- ing in the Senate in the aftermath of the hearing when he declared that in all his time as a Senator he had, never had an opportunity to be so enlightened, to learn so much from sources as trustworthy, important, conscious and knowledgeable. . . . This meeting was absolutely formidable in solving the problem . I admit to Dr Andre [Soares, bioethics professor at the Rio de Janeiro Catholic University] that I'm a practicing Catholic, with a very powerful faith. But, as I saw those pictures, Dr Mayana [Zatz, genetics professor at the University of Sao Paulo], of those children that could be helped ... by using these embryos that, as you all said, are inevitably headed on to the trash can, even if I understand that life begins with conception, I'll make an exception : I'll say that this life that was just fecundated, that has just started, starts not only being useful , but is able to show love and save a life which is already enjoying the daily beauties of our world. So, congratulations to all of you. I'm absolutely convinced of the need to go on with research, (emphases added) Christian representatives, on the other hand, ended up divided. Most Evangelical depu- ties eventually backed up the Senate's version of the Fifth Article after it returned to the lower chamber for a final vote. Even for some of them who acknowledged the embryo as life, the decision followed a lesser-of-evils logic: 'The Bible says, "To each day its own</page><page sequence="10">236 Social Studies of Science 41(2) evil", and today's evil is to vote the issue of the frozen embryos' (Senator Magno Malta, 15 September 2004). As for the Catholics, the hESC debate demonstrated how dissociated the Catholic Church's official stance is from the views of ordinary Catholics - in this case, representa- tives who were not aligned with the Vatican's pro-life doctrine. Among the many nominal Catholics who voted for the Fifth Article, different rationalizations were presented: some stressed the classic liberal imperative that State and Church must be kept separate; others framed science's alleviation of human suffering as a mandate from God; a few were content with ascertaining their belief through the assiduous fulfillment of Catholic rituals, such as attending Mass or confessing; and still others explored the Bible's inter- pretive open-endedness on the issue of life, such as when the first reporter of the Bill in the Senate, Osmar Dias, declared, 'I'm a Catholic [but] here I'm not contradicting any biblical principle because I've read in the Bible that we should protect life, and life in this case means to provide the conditions so that cells which are not yet life can be used for research that can save lives' (10 August 2004). Ultimately, the Catholic Church, in backstage negotiations with core Senators, begrudgingly accepted the use of unviable and/or unwanted spare embryos as long as it was done after a certain minimum period of freezing, which was eventually established at 3 years. This timeframe was reportedly included in order to prevent the emergence of what some referred to as an 'embryo industry' , or the mass production of in vitro embryos to feed the hESC research pipeline. The Bill also included other safeguards: consent from both genitors was needed in each case, the commercialization of such material was criminalized, and therapeutic cloning was excluded as an option. Even if, as noted above, Christian Congressmen's anti-hESC research stance did not heavily rely on biological arguments, some of them did disparage the contradictions and ambiguities underlying their opponents' relativization of life. This was, for instance, the tone of Representative Salvador Zimbaldi's ironic remarks during the March 2005 final vote. He said that the last reporter of the Bill in the Chamber of Deputies, Darcisio Perondi, had shown 'utter ignorance about the subject when he says "pre embryo". Alas, there's no pre embryo! Either it's an embryo or it's not; either the woman is pregnant, or she is not!' (2 March 2005). Others such as radical Senator Heloisa Helena went even further in denouncing what she saw as deceitful purposes lurking behind the debate's pragmatic focus: It's very easy, in the stem cell debate, to ask, what are we to do? Use the embryo or throw it away? Let's acknowledge that we are making a debate about the conception of life! . . . That's why this issue should've been addressed within the Assisted Reproduction Bill. ... Many hypocrites have taken advantage of the suffering of a mother who has her child marked by nature or by an accident to defend the transgenics! (6 October 2004) Indeed, the final votes on the Fifth Article were marked by considerable hype about the hoped-for therapeutic benefits of hESC research, as if they lay waiting just around the corner. On the other hand, the Bill's compromise did not fully satisfy either side of the debate; most Brazilian representatives went on to approve the Fifth Article under the assumption that it would be a temporary rule, until a more satisfactory one would</page><page sequence="11">Cesarino and Luna 237 be devised following a broader and lengthier public debate on embryo research and assisted reproduction. However, given the long backlog and snail's pace of legislation in Brazil, it is unlikely that such definitive regulation will come about at any time soon. The unlikelihood of a resolution in the Legislative might be one of the reasons for the importance assumed by the embryo debate once it reached the Federal Supreme Court. As we shall see, the high court, unlike the National Congress with its pragmatic bent, treated the conceptual question of the embryo's legal-biological-moral status as being at the very heart of the debates. The Supreme Court debate The ADI challenged the Fifth Article on the grounds that it violated constitutional protections of the right to life and the dignity of the person. Acceding to a suggestion by the claimant, on 20 April 2007 the ADI reporting judge, Justice Carlos Britto, opened a hearing for consulting with experts - the first public hearing ever to be held at the Brazilian Supreme Court. After two of the 1 1 justices had issued their opinions on 5 March 5 2008, the session was suspended due to a request for examination by Justice Menezes Direito (identified by the press as linked to the Catholic Church). The Court reconvened on 28 and 29 May, when the justices finally ruled in a six to five vote to uphold the constitutionality of the Fifth Article. Of the five justices who voted to restrict the Law, three (Justices Menezes Direito, Ricardo Lewandowski, and Eros Grau) accepted the petition's thesis of the violation of the right to life, whereas two (Justices Cezar Peluso and Gilmar Mendes) recommended the establishment of spe- cific bodies for overseeing research and therapy, or the assignment of these functions to existing bodies. The original petition and the public hearing in the Federal Supreme Court The petition's central thesis, that 'human life happens at and from fertilization on ' (p. 2), was based upon various 'scientific' statements quoted from scientists' personal declarations, scientific papers, and a book titled Vida: o Primeiro Direito da Cidadania [Life: The First Citizenship Right], published by CNBB's Family Pastoral.6 In it, Dr Dernival Brandao put forth the allegedly scientific argument that 4 the embryo is the human being in the early phase of life', adding 'that after fertilization there is a new, independent human being is not a metaphysical hypothesis; it is experimental evidence. ... The embryo is not a "potential person".' For the petition's authors, therefore, the embryo is an individual life autonomously developing from the moment of fertilization. The petition further underscored the autonomy of in vitro embryos while minimizing the maternal role in development, as shown in a statement by Dr Dalton Ramos: In this new life all information (the 'genetic code') needed so that the embryo knows how to develop is already included. No one else, not even the mother, will interfere in this process whereby the new being unfolds. The mother, through her body, will provide this new life with an appropriate environment (the uterus) and the nutrients it needs. But it is the embryo that both</page><page sequence="12">238 Social Studies of Science 41(2) manages and executes the construction. Therefore, the embryo does not 'belong to' the mother; it has a life of its own. The embryo is 4 in' the mother, who shelters it out of love. (p. 4) The assertion of the embryo's genetic individuality by reference to DNA and the reduction of the pregnant woman to the role of 'appropriate environment' and source of 'nutrients' are recurrent in the Catholic Church's religious documents. Professor Damian Garcia-Olmo presented advances in adult stem cell research as more promising than their embryonic counterpart. He also highlighted risks involved in the latter, such as tumors, rejection, and the need for immunosuppressant therapy. His conclusion asserted that the Fifth Article is 'inobservant of the inviolability of the right to life, since the human embryo is human life, and undermines the chief foundation of the democratic constitutional State, rooted as it is in the protection of the dignity of the human person' (p. 11). After demanding that the article be dismissed as unconstitutional, the petition requested a public hearing, and suggested experts for consultation. The petition and its justification therefore explicitly invoked biological evidence to support the case for the embryo as a person. Juridical questions, in contrast, were presented synthetically. A final passage stressed uniqueness and autonomy as defining features of the zygote as an individual: 'The zygote, made up of a single cell ... is itself capable, as an embryonic human being, of forming all tissues by means of differentiation and self-renewal; it is therefore a unique and irreproducible human being' (p. 10s). However, while biological arguments for defining life prevailed in the public hearing, the justices did not reproduce the argumentative strategy of reducing the juridical to a minimum while emphasizing natural foundations. The public hearing's avowed purpose was to gather data to furnish the justices with an operational definition of life consistent with the Constitution. Twenty-two experts appeared, all from biomedical fields, except for an anthropologist specializing in bioeth- ics. They assembled in two even blocs: one aligned with the Attorney-General of the Republic's Office and the CNBB (which officially appeared as interested party from the beginning), and the other with the defendants: the National Congress, the President of the Republic, and amid curiae (friends of the Court). Echoing their colleagues in the Senate hearing, pro-research experts deployed a more relativistic discourse about the embryo's status, and expressed greater concern with the dynamics of research and its consequences (for example, scientific backwardness and dependency, as well as harm to patients if research is curtailed). Once again, the stronghold of the opponents was the sacredness of life - most often displaced from the realm of metaphysics to that of nature by the same biologizing language found in the petition (Franklin, 1991). The justices' opinions: Rejecting the debate on the beginning of life The ADI was an occasion for comprehensively discussing the Biosafety Law's juridical aspects, but the present analysis will be limited to the issue of the beginning of life. Although this question bore directly upon the original petition's main thesis, not all justices engaged with it. Three justices entirely dismissed the ADI, and a fourth accepted it with additions to the Biosafety Law.</page><page sequence="13">Cesarino and Luna 239 According to Chief Justice Ellen Gracie, the Supreme Court's role was not to establish concepts, such as the beginning of life, that are not already written in the Federal Constitution: 'We are not an Academy of Sciences.' However, she did make reference to the abovementioned 14-day landmark, adopted by the British legislature as the threshold for permitting research on in vitro embryos. Chief Justice Gracie drew on the so-called utilitarian argument to argue that the use of supernumerary embryos in hESC research was indeed a 'nobler' destination than being discarded. The unlikelihood that the 'pre- embryos' covered by the Fifth Article would be used for reproduction (improbable, at best, for unviable embryos, and unlikely for the others) would, in her view, curb claims about right-to-life violations. Justice Carmen Lucia Rocha dismissed a juridical definition of the beginning of life as a pre-condition for state protection of the rights of embryos and the fetuses. The constitutional principle of human dignity would extend beyond the narrowly defined person, reaching all those endowed with humanity. This would be the case of embryos and deceased persons: even if they do not fulfill the conditions for legal personhood, they are nonetheless protected by law. She denied, however, that the Fifth Article violated the right to life, inasmuch as embryos do not attain life unless they are implanted in the uterus. To her, to discard 'embryonic stem cells' [sic] in the trash can would be an undig- nified destiny, whereas the Law allows for dignifying the embryonic stem cell by turning it 'into live matter, even though it is not itself alive'. Justice Rocha saw blocking hESC research as a constraint 'to the right to a dignifying life, to health, and to freedom of research and of being informed'. In her view, the freedom of human substance is no greater than the freedom of those who originated it. This idea contradicted the attribution of personhood to the embryo, here pictured as 'human substance'. Finally, she avoided the term 'genitors' included in the Law. Justice Joaquim Barbosa also held in check the question whether the Supreme Court should aim for an answer to the beginning of life. According to his opinion, which uniquely diverged from the prevailing biologizing discourse, no biological moment would itself be sufficient to close the question. Instead, the task ahead would be to verify whether the legal exception to the right to life is legitimate or not. The right to life and the protection of this right are, in his view, two aspects of a same right, which in itself is not absolute. He asserted that there are differential degrees of protection to human life, corresponding to various stages of the life cycle (fertilization, pregnancy, birth, development, and death), and contrasted the protection of the rights of the embryo to those of patients with unbeat- able conditions. Justice Barbosa also prioritized the possibility that collective benefits would result from preserving the right to life broadly conceived, that is, encompassing society as a whole. He stressed the need for rigorous oversight for research with human subjects, whether embryos, fetuses, children, adults, or elders. In sum, Justice Barbosa presented a typology of human beings based on the life cycle, where differential degrees of protection dovetailed with a corresponding ranking of the human condition. Similarly, Justice Gilmar Mendes did not find it necessary to discuss landmarks for the beginning and end of human life as grounds for juridical protection. He conceded that there is no universally acceptable answer to this question from science, religion, philoso- phy, or popular culture. To him, that there is no morally correct and universally acceptable</page><page sequence="14">240 Social Studies of Science 41(2) answer followed from the abortion, euthanasia, and embryo research debates. Finally, he asserted that life can be protected by law even when it lacks the legal status of a subject of rights. His conditional opinion proposed that decisions for approving and authorizing research projects should be delegated to an ethics committee under the umbrella of the Ministry of Health. Relativizing the beginning of life Four justices (Carlos Britto, Marco Aurelio Mello, Celso de Mello, and Cezar Peluso) discussed the beginning of life without accepting the thesis that fertilization is the inau- gural moment of human life and personhood. For Justice Britto, the beginning of human life would coincide with the moment of fertilization; however, based on the Brazilian legal system, he distinguished between the beginning of life and the reality that 'constitutes the physical or natural person'. He mentioned the Civil Code, which states that civil personality begins with live birth, but also that the law protects the rights of the unborn following conception. In his view, personality would be a prerogative for someone 'who is a person in a biographic ', rather than 'biologic', dimension. In this regard, Justice Britto drew on American legal philoso- pher Ronald Dworkin's notion of proportional legal protection: 'the Law protects dif- ferentially each stage of a human being's biological development ' (emphasis added). In contrast to the petition and its supporters at the hearing, he affirmed that embryo, fetus, and human person are not overlapping stages; therefore, there could be no 'embryonic human person, only an embryo of [a] human person'. The human person would be the outcome, and not the origin, of such metamorphosis. His approach therefore stood in stark contrast with the idea of potentiality, which was often embraced by embryo research opponents, especially those who spoke at the Court's public hearing. Justice Britto further differentiated between the harvesting of stem cells from lab embryos and the interruption of pregnancy. Since there is no ongoing pregnancy and the in vitro embryo is not susceptible to reproductive progression, he argued, laws crimi- nalizing abortion do not apply. In addition, he compared brain death to the early embryo's lack of nervous structures, and concluded that, without the brain, there can be no potential human person. Thus, in the context of the Biosafety Law the embryo would be a 'vegetative life which predates the brain'. Based on the constitutional right for 'free expression of scientific activity', he asserted that to prevent science from restoring people's full life would amount to help omission (an offense in the Brazilian Penal Code). Rather than disrespect towards the embryo, its use in research would mean caring for those who suffer. Justice Britto therefore opposed biography to biology in constitutional law, echoing Waldby 's (2002) distinction between the embryo as biography and as raw biologic vitality. The brain or its precursors appeared again as an embodied index of human rationality, and therefore of personhood. Justice Marco Aurelio Mello expressed a similarly relativistic perspective on the beginning of life. He listed different possible landmarks: conception, attachment of the embryo to the uterus, formation of the fetus' individual characteristics, quickening,</page><page sequence="15">Cesarino and Luna 24 1 viability, and birth. As argued by Conklin and Morgan (1996), developmental landmarks such as these appear to undergird modern constructions of personhood. Justice M.A. Mello also detached embryo research from abortion legislation. He alluded to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that 'viability' - the chance of survival outside the womb - marked the limit for legal abortion. In that case, he recalled, this precedent made debate irrelevant about the constitutionality of hESC research vis-a-vis the supposed violation of the right to life. In the Brazilian Biosafety Law, viability would not be at stake, since that law covered only non-viable in vitro embryos, or those frozen for more than 3 years which would never develop either due to the long freezing time or to a decision by 'those who provided the material'. He also mentioned the controversial quality of the constitutional protection of life, as indicated by the legal exceptions of therapeutic abortion and abortion in the case of rape. Also referring to the Brazilian Civil Code, he argued that legal personality and the associated rights depend on live birth. In IVF, there would be no biological unity underlying embryo development within the womb. Justice M.A. Mello further contended that gamete providers could not be forced to give birth to all embryos - that would turn the woman into an 'incubator', a violation of constitutional stipulations on family planning; moreover, he remarked that no law forces parents to donate organs in order to save their children. Justice M.A. Mello also criticized opponents of embryo research for their willingness to let the material be discarded rather than used for saving lives, and affirmed that restoring life to the diseased accords with principles of solidarity and personal dignity. From the perspective of equal treatment, this prohibition would harm those who are not able to seek treatment elsewhere. He therefore chose to preserve the hope encouraged by this Law. Justice Celso de Mello suggested that the controversy should be appraised from the perspective of human rights. He did not question 'the sacredness and inviolability of the right to life', and underscored 'the postulation of the dignity of the human person' as a 'generative value' of the constitutional order. But, given the constitutional principle of the laic (secular) State, the Supreme Court should not, in his view, solve controversies from a religious perspective. His opinion upheld the stance of a Brazilian Academy of Science's Work Group according to which the 'beginning of individual life' was a 'phil- osophical and moral' question embodying the relativity of all kinds of landmarks. According to this view, the diversity of theories defining the beginning of life would allow for searching for the one that is best adapted to the public interest and to the prin- ciple of human dignity. He mentioned the Brazilian Transplant Law, which prescribes brain death as the final landmark for life, and argued that hESC are harvested at a moment when there is 'neither personhood nor potential human being'. Justice C. de Mello further denied any 'ontological equivalence, at a normative level, between the embryo ... and the person already born'. Accordingly, the state may ponder the right to life 'in the face of situations that antagonize this right', that is, in circum- stances that oppose the interests of people bearing serious illnesses that one day may be overcome by hESC research. Finally, he appealed to the rhetoric of hope (Mulkay, 1993) by mentioning millions of suffering Brazilians who would have the right to the pursuit of happiness and to a dignified life.</page><page sequence="16">242 Social Studies of Science 41(2) Justice Peluso 's opinion was the only one to sustain the thesis that life is absent in frozen embryos. He began probing the matter of the different degrees of constitutional protection granted to those endowed with actual and full life for those embryos. He iden- tified humanness in both, but attributed life only to the former. According to him, the frozen embryo would share with the adult the requisites for constitutional protection of human dignity only to a rudimentary degree. From this, he pursued two lines of reason- ing: the embryo is (still) not a person; in the frozen or unusable embryo there is no actual life. He conceded that the embryo embodies attributes of humanity and shares the ' bio- logical nature ' and the 4 legal and moral dignity of the human being' (emphases added), but disagreed with its characterization as a person. Accordingly, the complexity of the person as an organism and a subject of rights could not be reduced to the biological aspects of 'its bare wholeness or genetic perfection'. Justice Peluso criticized two arguments according to which the blastocyst is the 'moral equivalent of a person': the first argument was that blastocysts and persons have identical genetic qualities, and are therefore entitled to the same moral dignity; and the second was that blastocysts have the potential to become persons. He denied that DNA alone would be enough to make the blastocyst equivalent to a human being, as the pres- ence of neurons would be a requisite for moral personhood. The potentiality thesis implies an aptitude for autonomous development without external intervention - an argument that is refuted by the need to transfer the embryo to the uterus. To him, then, the potentiality of the zygote would not be enough to define it as pre-birth life, nor to claim for it the juridical-ethical status of a person. Furthermore, Peluso identified life in the 'capacity for autogenic movement', the causal principle of which is the moving being itself. Frozen embryos, he argued, are suspended at an early stage, and lack the power to autonomously promote the biological events that bring unity to the life-cycle 'which individualizes human subjectivity'. The ADI's thesis about embryo development would therefore not apply to frozen embryos. Its perspective would depreciate 'the biological function and accompanying legal- normative condition . . . played by the woman's uterus'. Only 'life inside the womb', he argued, has 'constitutional value'. The implantation of the embryo, as precondition for development, would thus be the criterion for the beginning of life and the 'dignity of the human person'. The beginning of life at fertilization as a fact In contrast to most of their peers, three justices subscribed to the petition's view that both life and human personhood begin at fertilization. Besides proposing specific restrictions on embryo research and assisted reproduction, they limited the harvesting of stem cells to unviable embryos: those that had spontaneously halted cell division for more than 24 hours. For others, they approved techniques that would retrieve only one cell without damaging the embryo. Justice Menezes Direito wrote a technical opinion in which he recapitulated scientific methods of assisted reproduction and embryo culture, and reviewed the Supreme Court debate itself. He referred to the research advocates' thesis as a philosophical discourse on the embryo's intermediary status, which lends idealized support for an analogy with</page><page sequence="17">Cesarino and Luna 243 death that denies the embryo's personhood while also acknowledging its dignity. Justice Direito further criticized what he saw as an inadequate interpretation of Kant, to the effect that rationality is the foundation of the human condition. He went on to argue that, while death reduces human dignity, and while the embryo lacks rational capacity, the latter should be entitled to protection on the grounds of its future rational condition. Justice Direito challenged his peers to take a stand on the beginning of life. He criti- cized the metamorphose model Justice Britto adopted to distinguish the status of the embryo from that of a foil person, and put forward the alternative concept of potentiality. Accordingly, the embryo's potential life would justify its entitlement to protection. He also countered the view that life without personhood would not be human life: to him, personhood is an attribute of life, and not the other way round. He affirmed that the embryo's life is based on its genetic makeup, uniqueness, and capacity for autonomous development. The acknowledgement of 'human nature' or 'quality of human life' would not be enough; for him, one should seek in the Constitution 4 the guarantee of the invio- lability of the right to life and the dignity of the person.' He further proposed controls for IVF and pre-implantation diagnosis procedures, as well as restricting hESC research to procedures that do not require destruction of embryos. Similarly, he denounced the absence of a federal rule for in vitro fertilization and other activities that, in his view, would present risks to the human species such as genetic screening, the commercializa- tion of gametes and embryos, production of embryos exclusively for research, among others. Finally, Justice Direito suggested a centralized, federal oversight authority for human embryo research and assisted reproduction. Justice Ricardo Lewandowski's opinion had several points in common with Direito's. He referred to hESC as 'destroying a living organism which unfolded from the fertiliza- tion of human gametes'. He denounced the nefarious consequences of science when arguing that embryo research could jeopardize the human species. Accordingly, he defended the imposition of strict ethical and juridical limits to science in order to prevent people from being turned into things. Justice Lewandowski defended the constitutional status of international human rights treaties and of an international bioethics and human rights declaration (the 1969 Costa Rica Pact) signed by Brazil in 2002 according to which life begins at conception. The right to life, he concluded, should be protected from the point of conception, whether in vitro or in uterus. Justice Lewandowski argued that differentiating the treatment of embryos according to their freezing stage would run counter to the 'non-discrimination axiom' (according to which legal equality is violated when unequal treatment is seen as deriving from arbitrary motives). He stood against the 'pragmatism' of letting genitors decide whether to allow embryos to be used for research. Recalling cases of birth of long-time frozen embryos, Justice Lewandowski claimed that whenever there is potential for life, embryos should be implanted either in the mother or in non- fertile women, and that clinics should pay the cost of freezing. Finally, he proposed the adoption of supernumerary embryos. Justice Eros Grau gave a synthetic opinion, starting with a criticism of the confusion between scientific reason and faith in Science - for him, a kind of religious fanaticism. Based on the Brazilian Civil Code, he argued that if the yet-to-be-born are the subject of rights, logic demands that their personhood be acknowledged. Since for him human dignity predates birth, 'all beings susceptible to acquiring rights are persons': embryos would be</page><page sequence="18">244 Social Studies of Science 4/(2) part of an ongoing life process, and the uterus would be the home for that life. Justice Grau further asserted the need to establish limits for research and therapy, in order to avoid a 'precedent' for abortion. Finally, he differentiated between the destruction of life in abortion, and the construction of life in stem cell research. To sum up, then, contrary to the initial framing of the ADI some justices rejected the debate about the beginning of life. Most justices who supported the Fifth Article also argued that the embryos covered by the Law are not persons, that is, subjects with full rights. Taking this further, Justice Peluso argued that an embryo isolated in the laboratory is not a form of life at all. Two of the justices who regarded the Law as partly unconstitutional were especially concerned with the debate on when life beings, but so were others who were favorable toward it, such as the reporting justice, Carlos Britto. In the justices' opinions, therefore, the two key issues of the beginning of life and of the embryo's personhood status did not always overlap. Contrary to the biologizing trends prevalent in bioethics discourse, which were repli- cated in both the petition and the public hearing, most of the justices were moderate in the way they deployed biological concepts and arguments when addressing life and defining personhood. However, a lack of familiarity with such biological vocabularies may have led some of them to confuse the in vitro embryo, which is the source of stem cells, with the cells harvested from this embryo. Such confusion was expressed, for instance, in talk of 'implantation of embryonic stem cells'. The modern conception of the person as a sovereign individual, found both in the scientists' expositions in the public hearing and in the STF justices' opinions, was deployed in discourses by different justices both when they attributed personhood to the embryo, and when they denied it by claiming that embryos lacked certain attributes such as autonomy and viability. But, except for Justice Peluso, who dwelt at length on the conceptualization of life as autogenic movement, notions of 'life' and 'living' appeared quite vaguely and intuitively in most opinions. Several of the justices who supported the Fifth Article explicitly separated embryo research from the practice of abortion, but some of them referred to the two circum- stances in which Brazilian laws prohibit abortion to argue against a supposedly absolute legal protection of life. Justice Marco Aurelio Mello noted that US abortion legislation must have contributed to the elevation of the embryo's status as an issue for that coun- try's Supreme Court. The question remains whether the legalization of abortion would pave the way for laws defining the embryo's status. As indicated above, in contrast to the British HFEA, the Brazilian Biosafety Law did not define the embryo's status. This fact remained unchanged after the Supreme Court ruling. The relatively recent passage of abortion legislation had been on the horizon of various national legislative debates on human embryo research, as indicated for instance by scholarship on the British (Franklin, 1999; Mulkay, 1997), Dutch (Kirejczyk, 1999) and Israeli (Prainsack, 2006) cases, but the specter of (passed or defeated) abortion legislation appears to pervade almost all such debates (Gottweis et al., 2009). When questioning the embryo's developmental autonomy - the thesis of the original petition - some justices, such as Peluso, underscored the role of the uterus to the point of attributing agency to it. Justice Britto 's expression, '[t]he sentimental picture of the embryo in the uterus' wall', revealed an emphasis on the mother-child attachment for the constitution of personhood. This physical/sentimental attachment was copiously insisted</page><page sequence="19">Cesarino and Luna 245 upon as a fact not present in IVF embryos, and seemed to indicate a more relational criterion than other landmarks such as the primitive streak and the appearance of the nervous system. However, as Strathern (1992: 123) has perceptively argued with respect to the British debate, even in the mutual constitution of genetics (a given genetic program) and epigenetics (the embryo's interaction with the environment), the terms themselves - embryo and environment - are still seen as pre-existing the relation. In this sense, even the relativization of embryo autonomy in its relation to the mother would operate within the individualist configuration shared by both sides of the debate. Although religious values did seem to underlie the Supreme Court debate, the justices made strenuous efforts to avoid reference to them. Even when acknowledging the existence of religious values, many justices either insisted on the scientific character of their conceptualization of the embryo and embryonic stem cells, or emphasized legal- technical reasoning. Justice Grau was alone in mentioning the religious values from his personal upbringing, but still he promised a technical response. Justice Rocha expressed her religious values in a secular and nationalistic way when declaring that 'Brazil is my religion' and 'the Constitution is my Bible', thus echoing Durkheim's (2001) idea of religious values being transposed into laic national expression. Justice Peluso, in con- trast, used religious idioms to denounce 'supposedly scientific conceptions and rational attitudes' as being themselves intermingled with 'a passionate adherence to religious beliefs'. The effects of secularization thus appear to cut across the entire spectrum of the debate. The laic character of the modern public sphere often demands that religious values take a secular form; still, as shown by some of the justices' opinions, they are expressed as a defense of transcendental values. Justice Britto asserted that the 'sacred' in religion corresponds to the 'inviolable' in Law. Going beyond the national law, three justices (Britto, Rocha and Lewandowski) referred to UNESCO's declaration on the human genome, which proposed the intangibility of the human genetic patrimony. Such notions of sacred life in the embryo hark back to Durkheim's (1969; 2001: 140-142) perspective on the power of magical objects and on the individual as a cult object in modern societies. Later on, human biological nature was sacralized, as seen in the genome declaration and in laws protecting the embryo. It seems therefore that the 'life' at stake in the justices' opinions was not that of bio- politics and biocapital - these would be more closely related to scientific activity and biotechnology (Gottweis et al., 2009; Waldby, 2002). Rather, the interpretation of life as a juridical good presented by the justices echoed the religious language of life as a gift from God (Franklin, 1995). In this regard, it is worth recalling a passage by Dworkin (1994: 15) quoted by Justice Rocha: 'If the great battles over abortion and euthanasia are really about the intrinsic, cosmic value of a human life , as I claim they are, then those battles have at least a quasi-religious nature'. Conclusion As a peripheral activity, both in terms of the international distribution of stem cell research and of its relative weight in the domestic biomedical establishment (Luna, 2007b), hESC research and its regulation in Brazil seem relatively disconnected from the global socio-technical-financial loop recently described by Gottweis et al. (2009). Even though the passing of the Biosafety Law has prompted modest but steady public funding</page><page sequence="20">246 Social Studies of Science 41(2) for hESC research, in contrast to its human adult or non-human embryonic counterparts, this branch of regenerative medicine is still budding in Brazil.7 As a domestic issue, however, the controversy over the Fifth Article touched upon sensitive areas of public interest, sparking the struggles over the question of life dis- cussed in this paper. A comparison between the two phases of the debate shows that Congressmen were in general more sensitive to practical issues such as intellectual prop- erty, economic development, autonomy of national science, and guaranteeing therapeutic benefits for Brazilian citizens. As seen above, the eventual compromise crystallized in the Fifth Article was mostly pragmatic, while the question of the embryo's status tended to be altogether avoided. Relatively speaking, Supreme Court justices were more attuned to transcendent issues, whether framed in biological, juridical, or metaphysical terms. The Catholic Church's more visible presence in the Judiciary reinforces this point, as well as the fact that most of the justices did, to a greater or lesser degree, approach conceptual issues on life's inception. But these trends were not absolute. Even the Justices who sup- ported the ADI paid attention to hESC benefits and advocated some way of using embryos without killing them, while members of Congress expressed concern for embryo life when rationalizing their final vote on the Fifth Article. Human ESC research opponents' definition of 'life' turned on the attribution of human personhood to both the in vitro embryo and the fetus, thus expressing metaphysical assumptions grounded in religious views about life as a sacred gift from God. The notion of life as a juridical good, the interdict or sacred in Law, is heir to this religious view. But interestingly, even the Catholics felt a need to ground their juridical and legislative argu- ments in biology, in order to secure public legitimacy. Therefore, all discourses were underpinned by a conception of human nature oscillating between biological language and metaphysical conceptions of 'natural law' stemming from theology and human rights. A second kind of discourse avoided the conceptual debate altogether to adopt a more relativistic stance towards the embryo's status, while at the same time de-essentializing 'life' and breaking it down into relative parts potentially manageable by means of a utili- tarian, risk-benefit logic according to which the life worth protecting was that of patients. This perspective tended to cast the embryo as an ensemble of cells, alive only in terms of its raw biological processes. Opposing claims, on the other hand, emphasized the dan- gers arising from the commoditization of human life. Thus, while some sought to equate the biological definition of the embryo with legal and political personhood by referring to an absolute landmark (fertilization), their opponents strove to explore the ambiva- lences and/or refer to the multiplicity of possible biological landmarks. The first formu- lation resonates more readily with a privileged notion of individual personhood operating in the context of modern nation-states, consistent with much of the anthropological lit- erature on the subject (Dumont, 1986; Durkheim, 1969; Mauss, 1985). However, even in the ultimate trade-off between blastocysts and patients, the background social-biological norm of the individual in its consummate form - healthy, complete, and functional - also loomed large. Although these different perspectives on life tended to be more or less discernable in one or the other advocacy group, discourses and actors did not entirely overlap, but showed important ambivalences and slippages. Moreover, in all cases their deployment of the idea of life tended to slide through neighboring notions such as 'person' and</page><page sequence="21">Cesarino and Luna 247 'human', making evident the blurry frontiers between the biological and the social, since the a-historical biological body became the modern foundation for prescriptions about the social order (Laqueur, 1992). But if, on the one hand, the hegemonic representation of personhood as individuality (Dumont, 1986) was indeed pervasive in the debates, the practical enactment of those debates also rendered such broad assumptions about a pre-given, bounded individuality deeply problematic. As Strathern (1988) has argued, persons are the outcome of rela- tions (and not the other way round), and in modern culture such relations tend to be coupled with processes of 'domaining' (that is, of distinguishing entities by assigning them to discrete domains). Indeed, as Strathern indicates and our data corroborate, in the case of the new reproductive technologies this is most evident on two fronts: where the individual meets society (the question of personhood), and where it meets nature (the question of humanity). For the first dichotomy, Strathern (1999: 195) has argued that in Euro- American cosmologies 4 the person can be thought of both as an individual entity and as an entity enmeshed in social relationships' - the latter being especially 'reproduced through kinship'. This ambivalence seems manifest especially in the case of gametes and embryos, which tend to be individualized rather than being seen to share the personhood of the body from which they originated: 'in Euro- American convention a body taken apart is neither divided nor duplicated: it is more likely to be thought of as mutilated' (Strathern, 1992: 156). This further echoes the fabrication of kinship rela- tions identified by Franklin (1999) for the British debate; something similar could be said of the Brazilian Law's use of the notion of 'genitors' (rather than, for instance, 'parents' or 'providers of biological material'). On the other hand, the embryo controversy points to the nodal role the idea of the individual - as simultaneously part of nature and culture - has played in the emergence of the modern divide between facts and values (Dumont, 1986: 290-292). Tim Ingold (2002) perhaps best explores the tension inherent in humanity's character as both a bio- logical taxon {Homo sapiens) and a moral condition (mankind). In practice, this irresolv- able ambivalence - whether 'human nature' is to be understood fundamentally in moral or biological terms - overlaps and articulates with the question of personhood in multiple ways; thus the difficulties involved in reaching a consensus about the embryo's status as a (non)person. In the case of human embryonic stem cells, this is further complicated by the involvement of a significant number of subjects - the potential beneficiaries of therapy - whose lives also have to be taken into account. If the embryo is thus better conceptualized not as a bounded entity but as an 'in- between' (subject and object, natural and social) being, its shifting status can be captured from the perspective of its embeddedness in surrounding socio-technical net- works. Brazilian scholars Novaes and Salem (1998) disclosed the expanding web of relations surrounding the in vitro embryo, from kinship to the medico-scientific com- plex. In the case of hESC, this network is further enlarged to include powerful global actors such as the health industry and venture capital (Gottweis et al., 2009). In the legislative construction and subsequent legal challenging of the Biosafety Law's fifth article, various networks were found. On the one hand, representatives of religious groups (particularly the Catholic Church) who sought to protect the embryos were joined by part of the scientific community, such as the experts who supported the ADI</page><page sequence="22">248 Social Studies of Science 41(2) in the Supreme Court's public hearing. On the other side were scientists eager to advance hESC research, potential beneficiaries of therapy, various jurists and other networks such as feminists who hoped for greater flexibility and broader scope for legal abortion in Brazil. The Brazilian Legislature and Judiciary played a pivotal role in regulating the relationships among the components of these networks, which also included the providers of gametes. From this network perspective, the problem of personhood can also be regarded as a matter of alternating subject-object positions. Thus, even if the question of when life begins was not answered by Congress or the Supreme Court, the legal permission for using some of the frozen embryos as research objects can be seen as effectively denying their status as subjects of rights.8 The subject-object relation between persons and things was explored by Strathern (1988) with respect to Euro- American culture's notions of pos- session, which resonate with the tension between an all-encompassing State tutelage over the embryo and the Brazilian Law's referral of the decision about research donation to the 'genitors'. Moreover, in the case in point here, besides the juridical aspect, this relation also includes an epistemological facet whereby knowing subject is set apart from know- able object, and a therapeutic one whereby recipients of care are distinguished from thera- peutic artifacts. In each case, hESC advocates strove to push the early embryo to the latter, 'object' pole. Public debates on embryo research therefore pose vexed questions about the very boundaries of humanness. Brazilian representatives and justices have not really bid for a definite answer and, in contrast to their British colleagues, for example, they ended up retaining in the legal framework some of the ambiguities inherent to the controversy. The question of how to incorporate the obvious lack of a fixed classificatory space for such entities into stable regulatory systems, while bound to be answered differently, is shared by all legal-scientific communities confronted with the challenging task of devising an enduring ethical framework for embryo research. Notes 1. A more extensive analysis of the empirical data can be found in Cesarino (2006) for the National Congress, and in Luna (2007a, 2008) for the Federal Supreme Court. 2. For a few years, laboratories in Brazilian public universities had been developing therapeutic research with adult stem cells with outstanding outcomes in some areas, such as various cardi- opathies and hepatic cirrhosis. However, in 2003 work with embryonic cells was still incipient. Since in Brazil there was no specific law regulating embryological research, the new Bill was seen as an opportunity to secure legal backing for pursuing research in this recently opened biotechnological frontier. 3 . Although such aggressive politicization of religion is more typical of neo-Pentecostal groups, the Evangelical Caucus' leadership ranged from traditional denominations such as the Assembly of God to neo-Pentecostal exponents such as the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. 4. Brazilian legislation, enacted in 1940, defines abortion as a crime, except in the case of rape or medical threat to the mother's life. 5. Similar accusations were highlighted by Mulkay (1997) in his analysis of the British debate, including the seemingly omnipresent reference to the case of Galileo.</page><page sequence="23">Cesarino and Luna 249 6. Of the authors included in this book, five were invited to the expert hearing. 7. Some advances have been quick to materialize, though: for instance, the derivation of the first Brazilian hESC line from surplus embryos in October 2008 (Leite, 2009). Private funding, on the other hand, has been partly held off by Brazil's federal legislation, which is unfriendly to the patenting of human parts and their derivates such as cell lines. 8. Nor was this an absolute, universal ascription: the Brazilian legislation only included those embryos that were already frozen on 24 March 2005, the day the Biosafety Law was enacted.
