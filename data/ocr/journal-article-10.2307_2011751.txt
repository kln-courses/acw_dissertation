CHIABRA. -Considerations suggested by Titchener's 'Manual of Laboratory Practise,' Vol. II., and by Aliotta's 'La Misura in psicologia sperimentale.' Can mental phenomena be measured? Herbert's attempt to apply mathematical formuhle to mental phenomena was a total failure chiefly because his mathematical construction was not based on experience. Empirical psychology and physiology are distinct and separate fields, and quantitative experimental psychology based on the presumption that the psychical fact is, as such, a quantity is a scientific aberration. La Gnoseologia di Tertulliano nei suoi rapporti colla filosofia antica (pp. 209-228): G.

They are therefore urged thereto by a force or effort, the direct and indirect result of a conscious- ness and a will existing somewhere, though beyond our power to trace, which force we term gravity." Schopenhauer attributed the discovery of gravity to Hooke rather than to Newton. Rassegna Bibliografica. Notizie e Pubblicazioni. Sommari delle Riviste Straniere. Harvard Psychological Studies.
