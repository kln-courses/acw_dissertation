FRAZER, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. 2 vols. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1890. Pp. xiii., 409; ii., 407. These remarkable (and very handsome) volumes deal with a special question that has laid hold of the author in the course of an extended general inquiry into primitive superstition and religion. The question is of the rule of priestly succession at the wooded sanctuary of Diana by the Lake of Nemi (Aricia), on the Alban Hills. A runaway slave, the priest gained his post only by slaying his predecessor, after first plucking a bough, called golden, from the sacred tree of the grove. Without parallel in the historic times of classical antiquity, the strange usage remained in force down to the days of the empire. Mr. Frazer seeks to shed light upon it from every possible quarter-classical legend, customs of savagery, past and present, or of extinct civilisations, and notably (after the late W. Mannhardt) the still existing superstitions of peasant folk: With reference as well to the killing as to the bough- plucking, he is led into much general consideration of primitive animism ; the main outcome of which is to magnify the import of tree- (or plant-) worship for early religion, and, indeed, to make out this tQ have consisted of nothing, or little, else. That he has sometimes exaggerated, he is himself inclined to suspect ;4but the forcing of the argument, e.g., in the interpretation of particular myths, classical or other, may still not be without its use in insuring sufficient recognition for this element in the beginnings of religion. In view of all the multitudinous evidence brought to bear, the hilling of the successive priests is explained as a survival of the primitive idea that the spirit of vegetation, incarnated for the time in each, could only thus be preserved in full freshness and vigour. The golden bough is identified with the evergreen mistletoe, taken 4s em- bodying the life or spirit of the sacred oak more especially during its winter-sleep; and the plucking by the aspirant to the priestly office has thus a significance obviously contributing to that of the decisive killing. Detailed statement of the chains of evidence involved is not here at- tempted, much less any critical estimate of them ; but perusal of the " Study " leaves the impression of its being a model of its kind-and the kind one which has now become eminently suited to advance the ob- jective science of human nature. Its record of human perversities of dawning judgment, so many of them fiercely cruel in their effects, may leave the reader also with curious thoughts of the painful paths along which man has had slowly to stumble upward from his former estate.

Some exception could be taken to the author's scheme of " Science or Philosophy " on p. 4, even for the limited purpose of the lectures; but, once he is under weigh, the strong human interest of his treatment is well maintained to the close. Four divisions -are liade-of "The Be- ginnings of Political Science " (chiefly in Aristotle); " The Middle Ages and the Renaissance " (made to cover Hobbes); "The Eighteenth Century and the Social Contract " (from Locke to the protesting Burke); " Modern Theories of Sovereignty and Legislation " (from Bentham on). An Introduction to Social Philosophy. By JOHN S. MACKENZIE, M.A., Glas., B.A., Cantab., Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Assistant Lecturer in Philosophy at the Owen's College, Manchester; formerly examiner in Philosophy in the University of Glasgow. Glasgow: James MacLehose &amp; Sons. Pp. xi. 390. This volume contains the substance of the Shaw Fellowship Lectures delivered at the University of Edinburgh in January, 1889. It is an attempt to apply philosophical principles to the treatment of social questions, and is divided into, seven chapters. Ch. i. on "The Scope of Social Philosophy" contains a discussion of the place of social philosophy among other studies; the relations, in particular, to Ethics, Politics, and Economics are defined. Ch. ii. is on " The Social Problem," and contains a statement of those social questions to which it is at the present time most important that philosophical principles should be applied. Oh. iii. is on " The Social Organism," being a discussion of the sense in which it can be truly maintained that society is an organic whole. In ch. iv., which is on " The Social Aim," various possible views of the ultimate aim of social life are considered, and an attempt is made to define the aim with reference to the organic view of society. Ch. v. is on " The Social Ideal," to which the aim defined in the preceding chapter naturally leads; various one-sided ideals are criticised. In ch. vi., which is on "The Elements of Social Progress," the nature of the ideal is worked out more in detail, with special reference to the problems suggested in ch. ii. Ch. vii. contains a " Summary and Conclusion ". The general philosophical point of view is that of the Post-Kantian Idealism. (1) General Metaphysics. By JOHN RICKABY, S.J. (2) Psychology. By MICHAEL MAHER, S.J. (" Manuals of Catholic Philosophy.") London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1890. Pp. xi., 398; xvi., 569. Former Manuals of this Series have been noticed at greater or less length in MIND xiv., 140, 271, 290, and 425. Both of the present volumes are specially marked by, the effort to bring the Scholastic tradition into -relation with modern thought and research. As to the upholding of the tradition there is of course no mistake; modern thought being viewed in a general way as " the adversary" or "the enemy ". This view finds expression, with definite special application, at the opening of bk. ii. of Father Rickaby's General Mietaphysics. " The opponents whom we shall seek to encounter will be mainly our English Empiricists, because they represent the most natural aberra- tions of British intellect; whereas other aberrations are of an imported character, being borrowed especially from Hegel". At the same time the, disposition to make every concession that can be made without damage to the Scholastic structure is equally evident. " To represent the Scholastics of the present time as men all ignorant of experimental science would be as inaccurate as to represent them as all clinging, without abatement, to the old multiplicity of essential forms in all their</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 569 abundance. One point on which they are unanimous is, that the soul is not indeed the body, but the essential form of the human body; few would deny a similar office to a vital principle in the mere animals: very many affirm the like for vegetable life: and below this point the dissidents begin to multiply." Again, it is frequently and emphati- cally pointed out that by the Aristotelian Scholastics at least " essences are not supposed to be known a priori and to lead deductively to physical science, btut they are inferred a posteriori". On the other hand, science will never be able to dispense with the term : "essence ". "No Physics without Metaphysics." The method of "General Meta- physics " as here set forth is to proceed downwards from Being as quite undetermined or "transcendental" to Being as determined by highly general characters. Being (Ens Essentiae) is defined as an existible, or "that which does or may exist, whether it exist or not "; existence being "the actuality of an essence ". After Essence and Existence have been defined, the three Attributes of Being, namely, Unity, Truth and Goodness, have to be demonstrated. Next, Being is considered in its determinations as actual and possible, necessary and contingent, infinite and finite. This concludes bk. i. (pp. 1-220). Bk. ii. (pp. 221-385) deals with determinations of Being borrowed from the Aristotelian categories, considering it as substantial and accidental, as active in opposition to passive, as relative in opposition to absolute, as spatial and temporal. Substance and Causality are dealt with in an interesting way; an attempt being made to show that the conception of substance as substratum is not necessary to scholasticism; that it is sufficient for the Scholastic to be allowed to define it as " a Being existing per se ". Thus defined, even Hume-whose "vagaries on the question of sub- stance " have to be disposed of-is found to allow it occasionally, as for example when he says in express terms that he believes in the existence of substance as that which exists by itself, though he does go on to apply this to " perceptions ". The influence of modern work on the Neo-Scholastic Psychology, as might be expected, goes deeper than its influence on the Metaphysics; though the structure is in appearance maintained intact in both volumes. Father Maher's joining of old with new in his Psychology is very skilful; and sometimes the highly systematised character of the Scholastic doctrine gives him a certain advantage in face of modern psychological classifications with their more tentative character. The author is often able to go to a considerable length in the assimilation of modern ideas. "As all mental processes," he says at p. 15, "even the most purely spiritual acts of intellect and volition, are probably accompanied or conditioned by cerebral changes, too much labour cannot be devoted to the study of the constitution, structure and working of the organism." This, however, is somewhat qualified, if it is not quite contradicted, in another passage. "By describing the activity of intellect as spiritual or inorganic, the Scholastics implied that it is a function of the mind alone; that unlike sentiency it is not exerted by means of any organ. It seems to us incontestable that when properly understood this is the true doctrine " (p. 245)..- Perhaps formal contradiction is escaped when it is said that the intellectual activity of the " supra-organic or spiritual faculty" "depends extrinsically or per accidets on the organic faculties"; that " intellectual cognition always involves self-action on the part of the mind, but the conditions of such self-action are posited by impressions in the inferior recipient faculties" (pp. 247, 248). The Faculty-doctrine is, of course, maintained without wavering; the scheme adopted by the author being the "double division of faculties, on the one hand, into</page><page sequence="4">570 NEW BOOKS. sensuous and rational, and on the other into cognitive and appetitive " The phenomena of feeling (pleasure and pain) are not to be assigned to a special faculty, buLt are "reducible either to aspects of cognitive energies or modes of appetency ". Rejection of the modern tripartite division of mind is a note of Scholasticism. " Natural Dualism" is of course upheld; but the author seems disposed to adopt rather the form of it that makes perception of the body come first, and then perception of the external world; this last arising only in consequence of associa- tions and mediate inferences. The divisions of the work are :-" Intro- duction" (pp. 1-40): Book i. "Empirical or Phenomenal Psychology" (pp. 41-437); Book ii. "Rational Psychology " (pp. 439-545). to which is appended a Supplementary Chapter on "Animal Psychology " (pp. 546- 558). Under "Empirical Psychology," first " Sensuous Life" is dealt with (pt. i., pp. 41-230), and then " Rational Life" (pt. ii., pp. 231-437). Association, of which a pretty full account is given in connexion with Menmory, comes wholly within the first part (c. x., pp. 181-215). The faculties from which the two kinds of life-the sensual and the rational -proceed, are "two classes of faculties of essentiallv distinct grades". Sense apprehends the " suchness," the phenomenal qualities, but not the being, the " isness " of things. To cognise Being the intellectual faculty, the Rational or Spiritual activity of the mind, is required. Empirical Psychology is incomplete without Rational Psychology, which is strictly a philosophical science; its aim being to demonstrate the simplicity, spirituality, &amp;c., of the soul. In bk. ii., accordingly, recent theories concerning the soul, especially the "double-aspect" theory with its opposition to the Scholastic dualism, are dealt with. There is a slip when it is said that the school which, in one form or another, defends this theory, "is at least unanimous-however illogical-in teaching that bodily states, at all events, determine changes in our mental states" (p. 471); but this is exceptional. The historical and controversial parts all through the volume are in general very careful and well managed. In the "Rational Psychology" the old garment becomes more con- spicuous than in the other division, and the new cloth correspondingly less so; but even here there is an effort to assimilate as well as to controvert modern ideas. A serious attempt is made, for example, to show how the doctrine of an evolution of man's physical organism from that of a mere animal may be held consistently with the Catholic doctrine of the soul. In a chapter on Cerebral Localisation (which comes within Book ii.) and in the supplement on Animal Psychology, there is some incisive criticism on the want of conclusiveness in many of the results of modern research. Induction and Deduction: A Historical and Critical Sketch of successive philosophical conceptions respecting the relations between Inductive and Deductive Thought. And other Essays. By CONSTANCE C. W. NADEN. Edited by R. LEWINS, M.D. London: Bickers and Son, 1890. Pp. xxv., 202. The author of these essays died in 1888, aged 30, at the beginning of what promised to be a career of much eager activity, practical as well as intellectual. She had a poetic gift which has not failed of recognition, and, having had her mind turned also to philosophy while she was yet a girl, engaged afterwards in various studies, scientific and other. Her chief essay (pp. 1-100), giving name to this volume, was written (at the age of 29) for a college-prize at Birmingham. It displays, with superior powers of expression, a good understanding of the essential implication of Induction and Deduction with one another. On the historical side, it</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS. 571 is weak; with no sufficient continuity in the development, and the information at many points only elementary. The author appears to more advantage in one or two other of the essays, as a sympathetic yet withal independent critic of Mr. Spencer's ethical and sociological views. The chief philosophical stimulus came to her from Dr. R. Lewins, who issues the memorial volume. From him she accepted, under the name of " Hylo-Idealism," a doctrine that seeks to combine a thoroughgoing Protagorean subjectivism, amounting to solipsism, with a dogmatic materialism; and she was prepared to follow him, at least some way, in the use of a peculiar terminology (with words like " asself," " autosism," &amp;c.) which he appears to find needful. Two of the shorter papers expound something of this Hylo-Idealism, with more warmth than illumination. Hypnotism. By ALBERT MOLL (of Berlin). (" The Contemporary Science Series.") London: Walter Scott, 1890. Pp. xii., 410. This is a translation of a second and enlarged edition of a German book which made its first appearance last year. It is very rarely that it does not read as if it had been written in English-a fortunate effect of the unnamed translator's work which is doubtless in no small measure due to a simplicity (in general) of style very refreshing to come across in a German author. In point of matter, there is no less occasion for favourable judgment. The two main chapters, " The Symptoms of Hypnosis " (pp. 53-191) and " The Theory of Hypnotism " (pp. 218-72), give (the one) more comprehensive information and (the other) a more carefully and soberly thought-out view of the perplexing subject than can easily be met with elsewhere. Special recognition should also be made of the good sense that marks the author's treatment of "The Medical Aspects of Hypnotism" (pp. 290-333). Besides some helpful recommendation of other books, there are two excellent Indexes of Contents and Names, the latter giving, with many significant dates, a remarkably full list of those who have contributed early or late to the advance of hypnotic science. Altogether, the book is one to be com- mended to the psychological reader. The Psychology of thie Belief in Objective Existence. Part i. " Objectsiva capable of Presentation." By JULIUS PIKLER, Doctor of Political Sciences, Lecturer on Philosophy of Law in the Royal University of Budapest, &amp;c. London: Williams and Norgate, 1890. Pp. 118. This essay, written by a Hungarian author in English as well as worked out upon the traditional lines of English psychology, has for postscript the Discussion-note which appeared in the last No. of MIND, challenging the reply now made to it above, p. 545, by Mr. Stout. The essay itself, quite apart from the circumstances of interest attaching to its authorship, is no common piece of work, and will here receive the more detailed notice which it deserves. For the present it is broken off with promise of a Second Part, in which similar account will be given of the various classes of " Qbjectiva incapable of Presentation". A Protest against Agnosticism. The Rationale or Philosophy of Belief. By P. F. FITZGERALD. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Triibner &amp; Co., 1890. Pp. viii., 155. The present volume, while it is somewhat more condensed and orderly in exposition than the author's Treatise on the Principle of Sufficient Reason (see MIND xii. 614), is similarly illustrated by the results</page><page sequence="6">572 NEW BOOKS. of. very varied reading. Beneath the profusion of philosophical and poetical quotations there is a distinctive vein of thought. The ideas with which the author is preoccupied are, as before, the notion of the possibility of attaining, logically as well as mystically, a knowledge of absolute Being, and at the same time the conviction that distinctions of personality are of permanent significance. The reconciliation is found in the idea thus expressed: "It is wholeness of Being through union with its counterpartal soul for which each human spirit, even though it may be unconsciously, yearns. This is the lesson of reflective reason ". Thte Colours of Animals, their Meaning and Use, especially considered in the case of Insects. By EDWARD BAGNALL POULTON, M.A., F.R.S., &amp;C. With Chromo-lithographic Frontispiece and Sixty-six Figuires in Text. (" International Scientific Series," vol. lxviii.) London: Kegan Paul, Trench, TrUbner &amp; Co., 1890. Pp. xv., 360. Mr. Poulton has here given a very interesting account of the pheno- mena of colour in animals. His method has been, not to attempt even a general description of all the phenomena-which, of course, would not have been possible within the limits-but to illustrate principles by examples, chosen especially from Insects, and more particularly from the single order, Lepidoptera; the material having been provided to a very considerable extent by his own researches. The greater part of the book seeks to explain Protective and Aggressive Resemblance, Warning Colours, Mimicry, and the related facts, by the accepted principles of Natural Selection. In this part, it may be noted, as a point of psycho- logical interest, that insect-eating animals (such as lizards) are found to "learn by experience ". The most controversial chapters of the book- and, at the same time, those that come most within the province of the psychologist-are chaps. xv. and xvi. (" Colours Produced by Courtship," " Other Theories of Sexual Colouring'). Here Mr. Poulton appears as a v.ery strong supporter of Darwin's view as to the existence, among higher animals, of Sexual Selection, or " female preference based on Desthetic considerations ". This last point, it may be noted, is really the contro- verted point. Mr. Wallace, for example, admits a kind of " sexual selection," but a selection of the male for his greater "activity," or " surplus vitality,"' or some such non-oesthetic reason; beauty in animals (and plants) being, frequently at any rate, a result simply of organic laws of growth. Thus, without the admission of oesthetically determined sexual selection, it would be quite possible to accept Mr. Poulton's view that "the tendency towards the development of higher forms of beauty is rigorously kept in check by natural selection. Remove the check or render it less exacting, and the tendency at once manifests itself." The decisive question is, whether there are sufficient positive grounds for supposing a strictly aesthetic selection. Some of Mr. Poulton's argu- ments rest on a rather unquestioning anthropomorphism; as, for example, when he speaks of " an insect's sense of what is beautiful," or when he contends that "our standards of beauty have been largely created for us by insects thou gh, of course, we may find in the end that this is the only possible way of putting it. Is there any method by which it can be shown experimentally that, in some particular instances, the cause of the sexual selection that must be admitted to take place can be nothing short of oesthetic preference ? Counsels and Maxims: being the Second Part of ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER'S Aphorismen zur Lebensweisheit. Translated by T. BAILEY SAUNDERS, M.A. London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1890. Pp. 162. For convenience of publication, Mr. Saunders has divided his transla-</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 573 tion of Schopenhauer's Aphorismen zur Lebensweisheit into two parts. The first part, entitled The Wisdom of Life, was noted in MIND, No. 59, p. 421. In the present volume, with its new title, a new series of chapters has been begun, "for the sake of appearances," though there is no such division in the original. The merits of the translation are sustained to the end. On Sameness and Identity. A Psychological Study: Being a contribu- tion to the foundations of a Theory of Knowledge. By GEORGGE STUART FULLERTON. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. Pp. 156. Prof. Fullerton has once before set himself the task of clearing up a difficuilt fundamental conception of philosophy (see MIND xii. 468). The problem of infinity, dealt with in his former essay, reappears at the end of the present monograph; the question dealt with in the penultimate section being that of infinite divisibility, which, is solved in accordance with Berkeleyan principles. Realism (in its modern sense) is discussed in the section immediately preceding, and is dismissed as involving con- fusions of different mieanings of the word " sameness ". As may be seen from the nature of these final disquisitions, the metaphysical bearings of the abstract discriminations between senses of the term are not for- gotten. The discriminations themselves are very careful; seven senses of the word "sameness " being distinguished. Following upon the de- finitions of these senses, there are sections containing the application of them to " self" and "not-self," whether regarded as phenomenal or noumenal. Part i. (pp. 5-66), containing the abstract discussion of " The Kinds of Sameness," is followed by an " Historical and Critical " part ii. (pp. 67-153), dealing with the senses of the term as employed in philo- sophical arguments from Heraclitus to the present time. The author does not propose any rigid limitation of the term " sameness " in philo- sophy to one particular sense. " The word," he would rather conclude, " has many meanings, and we can hardly say that any one of them is illegitimate. It is merely illegitimate to confound them." " Identity " he looks upon as a kind of limiting conception. The common notion which unites all the kinds of sameness is the notion of similarity. When the dissimilar elements have diminished to zero, then there is "identity ". The word is somewhat loosely used, but it may be stated generally that " men use the word identity to mark certain kinds of same- ness in which there is little or no consciousness of duality, and they are not inclined to use it to mark sameness in which things are recognised as similar but clearly distinct ". The discussion of the sameness of the formal elements in consciousness (sec. 17) may be specially noted. The result is that if two successive occurrences of a material element--say, a, colour-sensation-are only similar and not numerically the same, this is also the case with two successive occurrences of a formal element-say, " the consciousness of triangularity ". " To say that the formal element is not a thing, but an activity, does not alter the position. If an activity is enough of a thing to be talked about and distinguished from other things, we may surely recognise an aptivity in consciousness yesterday as numerically different from an activity in consciousness to-day." [The author desires that the words " be recognised as resembling " be substi- tuted for " resemble " on p. 12, line 13, and p. 49, line 30; and " second" for " fourth " on p. 68, line 24.] ,ltude sur Fran9ois Bacon suivie du Rapport A, l'Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques sur le Concours ouvert pour le Prix Bordin.</page><page sequence="8">574 NEW BOOKS. Par J. BARTHELEMY ST. HILAIRE, Membre de l'Institut, S6nateur. *Paris: F. Alcan, 1890. Pp. vii., 203. M. Barthelemy St. Hilaire's study of Bacon extends over pp. 1-109. The rest of the volume contains his report on the four memoirs sent in for the Bordin prize offered by the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. In the study, perhaps greater stress is laid on Bacon's defects as a thinker than on his merits; but almost always the right view seems to be taken as to what is the nature of his merits and defects. His literary style, the author allows, cannot be overpraised. " The true glory of Bacon" is rightly assigned in his own phrase, when he describes himself as the"trumpeter" of the experimental method. He did not discover the method; nor was he the first to formulate the process of induction, this having been done by Aristotle. Metaphysics he on the one side sacrificed to theology, on the other side subordinated to science. He failed therefore to attain to the philosophical position of Aristotle, whom he cast aside. " In recommending the experimental method with so much constancy and energetic conviction, he certainly propagated it; he caused its utility to be better appreciated by those who were employ- .ing it without sufficiently reflecting on it. But that is not precisely a scientific influence " (p. 152). So far as real originality of scientific thought is concerned, he was surpassed by his predecessor and namesake Roger Bacon. Me'taphysique et Psychologie. Par. TH. FLOURNOY, Docteur en Medecine, Privat-docent de Philosophie A l'Universite de Geneve. Geneve: H. Georg, 1890. Pp. vii., 135. A very good statement of the parallelism of mental and physiological processes from the scientific point of view; the author's aim being to distinguish clearly the psychophysical position of the experimental ,psychologist from every metaphysical doctrine as to the relation between mind and body. He first shows how the "principle of parallelism or concomitance " has now become a " constitutive axiom " of physiological psychology; and then proceeds to explain how he finds it possible to make reserves in favour even of metaphysical free-will (for example) with- out giving up the principle as a postulate of all strictly scientific investiga- tion. . Personally he inclines to a doctrine which he describes as " agnos- tic Moralism " and places on the groumd of Kant's distinction between phenomenal determination and nouimenal freedom ; but what he is chiefly anxious to show is the possibility and necessity of setting physiological psychology free from all metaphysical implications. Psychology as a positive science must follow the example of other sciences by ignoring the philosophic difficulties at its base. It must make no attempt to explain why mental aiid physical phenomena are concomitant, but must simply accept them as being so. The two sets of phenomena being irreducible for science, a scientific " principle of dualism or heterogeneity " is to be recognised beside the principle of parallelism or concomitance. While it affirms that all psychical processes are accompanied by some physical process, the axiom of concomitance does not affirm that, conversely, all physical processes are accompanied by some internal psychical process. This may or may not be so, but it is a metaphysical completion of the scientific doctrine, and, as such, positive psychology has no interest in it. If psychology, to become a positive science, must become as far as possible ph5ysiological, physiology, on the other side, is in no way bound to become psychological. Its progress, on the contrary, consists in more and more complete explanation of its special facts by the objective sciences that precede it.</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 575 Psychologie de l'Apperception et 1echerches expe'rimentales sur l'A ttention: Essai de Psychologie physiologique. Par GEORGEs DWELSHAUVERS, Docteur en Philosophie et Lettres. Bruxelles: E. Guyot, 1890. Pp. xi., 179. This essay submitted as a " these d'agregation" to the faculty of philosophy and letters in the University of Brussels has a double interest. First, in point of content. Besides recording at length (pp. 61-104) a protracted series of origiAal experiments on the effect which a warning signal, at different intervals, has upon the reaction called forth by a definite stimulus, it affords a comprehensive view of the work that has been done, especially by or under the lead of Prof. Wundt, towards a psychophysical theory of Attention. It was at Leipsic that the author, last year, made his experiments, and the report of them is concurrently given in the latest No. of the Phil. Studien (see below, p. 587). Though they were cut short prematurely, Prof. Wundt considers them, so far as they go, of substantial value ; and more eager acceptance of the experimental method in psychology there could not be than is proclaimed (and justified) through all the rest of the essay. The other interest attaching to the thesis arises from its rejection by the Brussels faculty, at the instance of Prof. Tiberghien, who for so many years has upheld the standard of philosophic rationalism (in the spirit of Krause). The author's enthusiastic advocacy of the newer psychological methods and hopefulness of philosophical reform to come from them have thrown the aged thinker into consternation. Having joined in sending the young Belgian student to Leipsic for instruction in the experimental method, he now starts back in horror at the revolutionary aspirations disclosed by the ardent neophyte. How, he asks in accents of mournful reproach, how can he go on defending, in his academic chair, the cause of human liberty against the clerical party, if " Reason," which nerves his arm, is henceforth, within the walls of the free Brussels University, to be spoken of as subordinate to "Experience" ? It is, altogether, a very curious little correspondence that is here printed as Appendix to the essay-curious because the " liberal " Brussels professor would use against the Catholic party precisely the same weapon which, everywhere else (and doubtless also in Brussels itself), that party likes to brandish in the face of those whom it considers its philosophic foes. For the rest, it strikes one as a little surprising that only now upon this ocoasion such an academic declaration should be launched in the country which Prof. Delboeuf of Liege (no weak-kneed "liberal ") has for so long kept well to the front of the psychophysical movement.

Verona: Donato Tedeschi e Figlio, 1890. Pp. 83. The author has already set forth in outline the reasons for giving Sociology a place among the sciences (see MIND xiv. 298). He now proceeds to inquire whether the existence of a Philosophy of Law is compatibla with the definite constitution of socio- logy and with the principles of positive or scientific philosophy generally. His conclusion is that in spite of the tendency of an ill- understood Naturalism to deny that there can be any properly philoso- phical treatment-going beyond the scientific treatment-of social facts, the philosophy of law, as of other departments of social life, must retain its place among the philosophies of the practical arts as conceived by Mill. In virtue of its " critical"' function, philosophy has to examine</page><page sequence="10">576 NEW BOOKS. tlhe first principles of all sciences, whether natural or social, and the ends of all practical arts. Again, the conception of philosophy as universal " synthesis" requires that every special science having social phenomena for its subject-matter should be brought under the conception according to which all the elements of social life are viewed as factors of a general human evolution. Tonpsychologie. Von CARL STUMPF, Professor der Philosophie an der Universitat zu Miinchen. Zweiter Band. Leipzig: S. Hirzel, 1890. Pp. xii., 582. Prof. Stumpf (who has in the interval passed from Prague to Munich) here continues the very important work which he began in 1883; see MIND ix., 161, 593. Occupied in his first volume with the judgment of successive tones, he does not in the second get beyond our consciousness of simultaneous tones, apart from any question of properly musical apprehension. This is still deferred to a third and a fourth volume, to follow as soon as he may be able to compass them-but not, he thinks, very soon-in the midst of his general philosophical duty. If he may -thus seem to have bestowed an excessive amount of time and space upon the bare material elements of music, it is not to be forgotten that his subject is Tone-psychology, as a whole, and that he makes this the occasion for enlarging upon questions of general psychological principle. This he did to excellent purpose and effect in his previous volume, and the same procedure is now maintained. The two volumes, having together a certain completeness by themselves, are here by a happy thought pro- vided with a good Index. Critical Notice (of the new volume) will follow.

Professor fur allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft an der Universitiit zu Berlin. Zweite vermehrte und verbesserte Auflage. Erster Teil. Berlin: F. Duimmler, 1890. Pp. xvi., 374. Here Dr. Steinthal publishes pt. i. of a second edition of his History of the Science of Language among the Greeks and Romans, first pub- lished in 1863. The alterations, though affecting this part to some extent, are, he tells us, not so extensive as in the second part now in the press. In the first edition the work appeared in a single volume. It is now divided so that the contents of the first volume belong essen- tially to logic, those of the second to empirical grammar. This is in accordance with the historical circuLmstance, dwelt on by the author, that the dialectical investigation of speech by the Greek philosophers preceded the. elaboration of a "true grammar" by the philologists of Alexandria. The Introduction (pp. 1-40) describes the germs of grammar in those peoples that can be said to have arrived at any grammatical consciousness. Only two-the Indians and the Greeks-of themselves and without external stimulus developed anything amounting to a real grammar; the Indian grammarians having been, as the author seeks to show, in the most favourable position for grammatical analysis. In the rest of the volume, Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics (with whom the dialectical analysis of language in antiquity is regarded as having reached its termination) are dealt with. Sittliches Sein und Sittliches Werden. Grundlinien eines Systems der Ethik. Von THEOBALD ZIEGLER. Zweite ulnveranderte Auflage. Strassburg: Karl J. Truibner, 1890. Pp. ix., 151.</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 577 Five Lectures (" Problem and Method of Ethics.-Historical Survey," "The Origin of Morality," " The Nature of Morality," " Duty and Virtue," " Goods and Highest Good"), now published with additions and remarks, and indexes of names and subjects. The author begins by showing that ethics has not to create morality; it is first a descriptive science. Under the rule of custom men had long practised morality before they began to theorise upon it. Description of actual good con- duct has to be followed in the second place by statement of its grounds. Since conflicts arise between rivalt-social authorities, ethical science has next to become " critical". Its most important problem is to find a, criterion of action. Finally, it cannot avoid becoming "c speculative- metaphysical ". Besides conflict of authorities, there is an opposition between authority generally and freedom-between the social customs in which morality has its origin and the conscience of the individual. This opposition also comes within the competence Qf ethical science. As to the criterion, the author's general results are these. " The wel- fare of all, as it is the rule and the principle, so also it is the end of all ethics, the highest good itself." " When I do with consciousness what objectively corresponds to the principle of welfare, then I am also sub- jectively a morally good man." The argument is illustrated by appro- priate references to current topics of social morality. Ein Collegiurm Logicum im XVI. Jahrhundert. Mittheilungen aus einer Handschrift der k. Universitatsbibliothek in Tiibingen. Von Dr. CHRISTOPH SIGWART. Freiburg i. B.: J. C. B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1890. Pp. 42. Prof. Sigwart of Tiibingen here gives representative extracts, of peculiar interest, from a transcript preserved in the university library there, of the lectures on Aristotle's Prior Analytics delivered 1565-7 by Jacob Schegk. Schegk had been professor of medicine at Tuibingen from 1553, and being renowned as an Aristotelian expositor was further charged from 1561 with the duty of lecturing, as-professor of philosophy, on the Organon, in place of one Mendlin (Maentlin) under whom the philosophical reputation of the university had died away. Mendlin, it appears, would not at once retire, and it was not till 1564 that Schegk's logical prelections began. Such was his reputation that they were then attended not only by students but also by several of his professorial colleagues; one of whom, the well known scholar Martin Crusius, was the note-taker or for the most part full and accurate reporter whose MS. has -been preserved. The lectures in 1564, presumably, began with the earlier treatises of the Organon. Crusius's MS. takes up the exposition in Nov. 1565 with the Prior Analytics, to which Schegk devoted as many as 174 lecture-hours-117 to bk. i. and 57 to bk. ii.-spread over nearly two full years, before passing without pause to the Posterior Analytics. It was thus a very elaborate course of which the main part has by Crusius's exemplary diligence been preserved, and of which Prof. Sigwart has now with admirable care and all necessary elucidation given these specimens. Very curious and instructive they are in many ways. We see in Schegk a really vigorous and able teacher, master of his text; which at timeshe expounds word for word before digesting the doctrine into dictation-paragraphs and adding illustrations, while at other times he counts upon his hearers' being able at once to follow his 'free exposition of the easier passages. Nothing has ever been put in print which brings us so directly face to face with the best academic work of the closing middle age. Crusius's transcript is all the more valuable because it embodies also the occasional colloquial remarks in 37</page><page sequence="12">578 NEW BOOKS. German (or Latin) which the lecturer would let fall in the midst of his regular (Latin) exposition. These in general are meant the better to drive home his meaning, but sometimes they are of much human interest, as when, getting confused over a logical example at the end of an hour, Schegk breaks off: " Gras emendabo, ich habe mich selbst geirrt da ". Another time, he has this: " Non potui praeterire haec hactenus, etiamsi jam non potuistis omnia forte intelligere; tamen, cum acceperitis mea commentaria, intelligetis. Ichv kans nit qmit einem traechter eingiessen." And here is the epilogue to that part of the course which Crusius gives us: " Gras incipiemus ipsa posteriora Analytica. Nihil, nisi forte necesse erit, dictabo. Ideo emite vobis eorum commentaria, Tybingae [Sigwart has to correct this to Basel, as the true place of publication of Schegk's commentary on the Post. An.] impressa. Sparet das gaelt ein waenigi, et emite illum librum." Interspersed are jottings by Crusius, from which much is to be learned about the distribution of the academic sessions and the holidays that divided or interrupted them. We have also the sanitary condition of Tiibingen brought before us in the fact that from 30th October, 1566 the lectures had to be given at Esslingen, on account of plague which did not permit of return to the university-seat so long as the Prior Analytics held out (and indeed for some weeks longer-four- teen months altogether). The (second) wife, the six-year-old " dulcissima filiola," and the aged mother of -Crusius, as he tells us, all fell victims to the pest in its first weeks. Nine months afterwards the lonely professor consoled himself with a third wife at Esslingen, and over the marriage lost Schegk's lectures between 12th and 16th August, but was able to fill them in from the notes of another hearer. Prof. Sigwart's labour upon the MS. deserves very warm acknowledgement. Die Geschichtsphilosophie Hegels und der Hegelianer bis'auf Marx und Hart- mann. Ein kritischer Versuch von Dr. PAUL BARTH. Leipzig: 0. R. Reisland, 1890. Pp. 149. A very thorough study of the " philosophy of history " of Hegel and his successors (so far as they have adhered to Hegelian principles). Under his general title the author deals not only with the philosophy of history strictly so called, but also with the history of religion, art and philosophy. His aim is to show the error of Hartmann's remark that only the form, not the content, of the Hegelian philosophy is antiquated. His method is to bring the results of modern positive inquiry in all the fields dealt with into comparison with the deduction, by Hegel or his successors, of the course of history from the principles of ' dialectic'. A particularly full refutation (pp. 40-61) is given of the doctrine of Marx that all other social activities are determined by the economical constitution of society; the independence (in a great measure) of political, legal, religious and philosophical development being established by reference to the work of historical investigators. Marx's doctrine is found to have been deter- mined in form by the influence of the Hegelian philosophy. Its real merit is in taking into account the reaction of economical structure on society as a whole. Its defect, due to its Hegelian origin, is in making economical factors determine everything. In content it is the opposite of Hegel's own view, which- makes " the idea " omnipotent; but this is equally erroneous. The employment of the Hegelian method leads only to distortion of the facts, which always have to be introduced surrepti- tiously. The " secret of the Hegelian dialectic " is simply the confusion of contrary with contradictory opposition. It is only by this confusion that Hegel and his disciples can bring positive facts within their dialectical process at all. Dr. Barth's book has been written not without a view to</page><page sequence="13">NEW BOOKS. 579 recent developments of Hegelianism in England and America, of which he shows full knowledge; as he does also of those modern English (as well as French and German) inquirers into the early history of institu- tions whose progressive results he would oppose to the illusory combina- tions of the Hegelians. Die ethische Bewegung in der Religion. Von STANTON COIT, Ph. D. (Berlin), Sprecher der South Place Ethischen Gesellschaft in London. Vom Verfasser durchgesehene Uebersetzunog von GEORG VON GIAYCKI. Leipzig: 0. R. Reisland, 1890. Pp. 227. This translation by Prof. v. Gi2ycki of Dr. Coit's addresses delivered to the South Place Ethical Society reads very well in German. One may wonder, however, that the collection has not been previously published in English, as doubtless the separate addresses have been. The idea running through them all is expressed in the title-" The Ethical Movement in Religion ". They are all marked by an enthusiasm for social reform, together with a belief in the supreme importance of the inner moral life both in itself and as the starting-point of everything to be done for improving the external ordering of things. Morality, conceived in this way, is not put forward as a competitor with existing religions, but as capable -of allianoe with them, and yet as having an independent life of its own, which is only not called " religious " because religion implies, over and above exalted ethical feeling, submission to some Power, whether external or immanent-and this is not an essential part of morality. Theoretical agreement as to the basis of ethics is to be looked forward to as a distant end, but it is not to be sought first of all. The aim for the present must be to attain practical agreement as to conduct ; in the confidence that theoretical agreement will come afterwards as morality gradually penetrates all religions and displaces ideas inconsistent with devotion to ethical culture as the supreme interest of life both for the individual and for society. Kurzgefasste Logik u. Psychologie. Von Dr. K. KROMAN, ord. Professor der Philosophie an der Universitat zu Kopenhagen. Nach der zweiten Auflage des Originals unter Mitwirkung des Verfassers ins Deutsche iibersetzt von F. BENDIXEN. Kopenhagen: J. Frimodt; Leipzig: 0. R. Reisland, 1890. Pp. xii., 389. This manual by the Danish author of Unsere Naturerkenntniss (see MIND ix. 160) has some exceptional qualities that call for more notice than they can receive on the present occasion. We will the m6re endeavour to return to it in MIND because the author's earlier work failed, through various circunmstances, to get here anything like the amount of httention due to its great freshness and vigour of treatment. Fortunately, his main epistemological positions get restatement in the present (more elementary) book, which, after being favourably received in its native Denmark, is now, in effective German translation, made accessible to a far wider public. The conjunction of Logic and Psycho- logy, in that order, is, though not without a certain reason (of which more later), still somewhat artificially made. The author, however, in both divisions pursues so independent a course and writes so suggestively that he is to be judged much more by the matter of each than upon any consideration of mere external form. Two things are noted by himself as specially significant in his psychological section--a hostile criticism, from his distinctively scientific point of view, of the current two-aspect theory of mind and body, and his rejection of ' Association by Similarity'. This latter is a topic to which, -from different sides, also other Danish</page><page sequence="14">580 NEW BOOKS. psychologists, notably Hoffding and A. Lehmann, have given special attention. Die Gesetze und Elemente des wissenschaftlichen Denkens. Ein Lehrbuch der Erkenntnisstheorie in Grundziigen, von Dr. G. HEYMANS, Privat- docent der Philosophie an der Universitat zu Leiden. Erster Band. "Allgemeiner Theil und Theorie des mathematischen Denkens." Leiden: S. C. van Doesburgh, 1890. Pp. 270. This is the first volume of a text-book of Theory of Knowledge and treatise on Method. It is divided into an Introduction (pp. 1-42), a General Part on Formal Logic (pp. 45-121), and a Special Part on the Mathematical Sciences; those dealt with at present being Arithmetic (pp. 125-166), Geometry (pp. 167-258) and Kinematics (pp. 259-270). Theory of Knowledge, in the author's view, is a " psychology of thought ". We have to find, in the first place, what elements of knowledge are experientially given. These being found insufficient to constitute actual knowledge, we have next to determine what subjective data are added by the mind. The most convenient objects of this investigation are the sciences; scientific knowledge being more readily submitted to exact analysis and synthesis than the knowledge of common life, though this also involves the same elements. Accordingly we discover in science the " universal human " causes of certitude; and the psychological ascertain- nient of those causes is at the same time the justification of the elements contributed by the mind to knowledge. Dealing with formal logic, the author opposes to the " empiristic theory " of Mill and to the " geome- trical theory" of Lange and others the view that "logical laws are not laws of things, but exclusively laws of thought ". In his treatment of geometry, he seeks to place the Kantian attribution of geometrical knowledge to " subjective factors " on a psychological foundation by the more precise determination of those factors ; here following Riehl, whose "Ihypothesis" that geometry is to be explained from the date of the " sense of motion " he accepts as at least " very probable ". Der Optimismus und Pessimismus in der jiidischen Religionsphilosophie. Eine Studie iuber die Behandlung der Theodicee in derselben bis auf Maimonides. Von Dr. H. GOITEIN. Berlin: Mayer &amp; Muller, 1890. Pp. viii., 112. A very interesting and instructive account of the treatment of the problem of evil in Jewish religion and philosophy. Dr. Goitein's " study " is divided into a first part dealing with " Theodicy in the Biblical and Talmudic Scriptures" (pp. 1-34) and a second part dealing with " Theodicy in the Jewish philosophy of the Middle Ages " (pp. 35-111). The medieval philosophers whose doctrines are expounded are (1) Saadja, (2) Joseph ibn' Zaddik, (3) Jehuda Halevi, (4) Abraham ibn Daud, (5) Moses Maimonides. Neither Jewish philosophy nor religion, the author seeks to establish against Schopenhauer, is unifotsmly optimistic. In reality the characteristic attitude of Judaism, manifest at a very early stage and finally affirming itself after all the influences from ancient philosophy, Christian gnosticism, &amp;c., undergone by Jewish thinkers, is optimism in " view of the world " together with pessimism in " view of life ". Pessimism as regards life in the present is overcome by a "trans- cendent optimism" having reference either to life on earth in the future (as with the prophets) or to a future life of the individual (as with p'hilosophers influenced by Greek thought). The problem of an " im- manent theodicy," or justification of the evils of life as part of a provi- dential government of the world, is constantly attempted by the Jewish</page><page sequence="15">NEW BOOKS. 581 philosophers, but receives no satisfactory solution. The only tenable position for the religious as for the philosophical consciousness is in the end renunciation of every theodicy that is not " transcendent ". This renunciation is common to the Jewish religious consciousness and to the Kantian philosophy. Glacuben oder Wissen? Eine Untersuchung Uber die menschliche Geisteseinheit auf biologischer Grumdlage. Von Prof. Dr. KARL FIsCHER, Gymnasialdirektor. Gotha: F. A. Perthes, 1890. Pp. 60. Setting out from a consideration of man's biological predispositions as compared with those of animals, the author concludes that only by the act of will involved in belief could man have become what he is. Purely " objective " knowledge, knowledge without emotion, is diametri- cally opposed to hiuman nature. The "autonomy of science" is a fiction. Science, in reality, rests on an "unlscientific " foundation of feeling and belief. The division imagined between religious belief and scientific knowledge, therefore, does not exist. Science and religion, when philosophically examined, are seen to have similar grounds. Neither of them is ". presuppositionless ". Belief in general arises from a feeling of " dependence," from which human nature in vain strives to emancipate itself. This being recognised, there is nothing to hinder us from conceiving the sciences, whether of nature or man, together with a religion based in revelation, as forming a single system without any break or opposition of its parts. Independence. Stanzas by G. TH. MEJDELL. Christiania: A. Cammer. meyer, 1890. Pp. 46. This daintily printed collection of sentences or thoughts (rather than " stanzas ") is concerned with an old theme, but has an originality of its own. The theme is the old one of each man's duty to rise above external circumstances and live his own life-to become and be himself. It is turned over by the Norwegian author in a threefold series of reflexions; to find the most suitable expression for which he began four years ago, at the mature age of 35, to teach himself English. Thus he describes his " opuscule " as " an experiment-to corroboration of a theory: its gospel is autodidacticism and itself an offshoot of autodidacticism ". With a purely literary knowledge of English, his expression is, in general, very quaint; but it is a quaintness that has curious charm and force, and there is always masculine thought behind. Take one or two sentences for illustration at random:-" It has become the vogue to sing the praise of childhood as the happy age. The children of the nineteenth century will sparely join in this hallelujah, knowing at once too much and too little to do cherubs ".".. " Lawbound is the universe from infinity of beginning to infinity of end--infinity not the oppositeness of the finite but the finite's consummation, and chance the infinite compound of finite causes" . . . . " The drip, drip, dreariness of steady application is nothing to the bore. But to bectr boredom and no bore be-is the blend of parts that conquers the, world." (Italics not the author's.) Readers of sentences or clauses like these will "sparely" refrain from wishing to know more of such an " autodidact THE following NEW EDITIONs have been received: The Methods of Ethics.

[A fourth edition in sixteen years from its original publication testifies both to the standard character of this work and to the abiding English interest in at least ethical speculation. Alterations are now made in the way of inserted addition, to meet criticisms by Dr. Martinea.u, Prof. Fowler, Mr. Rashdall and Prof. v. Giiycki, and in the way of substitu- tion, to deal with Dr. Martineau's ethical theory in its later-published final form. The positions taken up by Prof. Sidgwick on the topics involved in these alterations have, at one time or another, had prior statement in the pages of MIND. By compression or omission of other matter, with occasional shifting of digressions from text to foot-notes, room has been found for the alterations without adding a single page to the length of the third edition. The apparent extension, pp. 506-22, is taken up with a very serviceable Index made by Miss Jones of Girton College. With this, added to the analysis of the whole main argument, given from the first in such excellent form under the head of " Contents," readers have all the help they could desire to effective use of the now celebrated book.] Character as seen in Body and Parentage.
