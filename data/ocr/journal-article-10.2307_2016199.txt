Again without the information contained in the dedicatory letter to J. E. Spingarn one would recognize it to be a collection of separate papers strung together on the thread of a common theme. Its nine chapters deal- ing with varied aspects of language are quite clearly so many essays. And these prove to be uneven in scope, in interest, and in plausi- bility. The book, however, as a whole is provocative. Its erudition is devoid of pomposity and it is speculative in the best sense of that word-filled with tentative though far-reaching suggestions as to the psychological implications of language-as to its meaning for culture and for the life of nations. At the outset a distinction between language and mere conversa- tion is asserted. " The difference between language and conversation is that the former is unthinkable without a plurality as well as a community of persons. A single person, in however many parts and situations he may express himself, can never produce language, only conversation" (p. 14). Later on the author has much to say about these language communities, the essay on this subject being much the longest in the collection. That the genus has many species is in- dicated by the following observation: "Not every language com- munity is at the same time a community of peoples. A language can bring men together in a hundred different kinds of communities. Latin, to begin with, was the language of the Latin race. In the course of time it became the language of the Roman state, then the language of the Catholic church, and finally the paper language of scholars" (p. 120). As to the origin of tongues with their characteristic differences, Professor Vossler is emphatic that not environmental nor even ethnic factors but uge; must be held responsible. "In the light of modern science no one dares to believe that climate and the nature of the soil have any influence on the speech of man. Nor has it ever been proved that there is a necessary connection between races and their language forms" (p. 81). And yet the bond between the ways of thought and action of peoples and the language forms which they evolve is an intimate one. It is now clear, we are told, "how each race fashions its own Weltanschauung, or rather the potentialities of a Weltanschauung; how by their language and through their language nations unfold their spiritual characters into living rela- tionships and interactions; and how there rests in the lap of each language a kind of predestination, a gentle urge to this or that way of thinking" (p. 131). The language that they speak becomes, more- over, to nations an important symbol of their national integrity.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 355 "Tolerance of national languages is a . . . later, tenderer form of human culture . . . if I throttle my neighbour's mother tongue in order to impose my own on him, what excuse can I have except that of conceit, which is made no better by the fact that it is a national conceit? For my neighbour's language is his inner eye, his form of thought, with all its potentialities of expression, his spiritual child- hood and future" (p. 132). It is therefore to the credit of the ancient Romans that "they never made war on the languages of the countries conquered by them" (p. 118). But languages, because they have their being in use and because they must reflect living, changing thought, are not static, which means inevitably that they become increasingly differentiated. Even knowledge and interests shared by different peoples are variously reflected in their speech, fostering a continuous alteration of it con- forming to the individual genius of their race. "The characteristics of individual minds are not destroyed by common tasks and common competition, but are all the more emphasized, and instead of re- maining potential are forced into the light of achievement. That is why the differences between Italian and French, or between French and German, have become greater rather than smaller since the rise of the natural sciences. The essential differences in the structure of the sentence in the Romance and the Germanic languages, and between the order and the formation of words in French and Ger- man, as well as differences of accent, were less pronounced in the Middle Ages than they are now" (p. 204). Even borrowings are a manifestation of the ultimate individuality of each national speech. "I should like to believe," Professor Vossler observes, "that the creativeness of a people with regard to sentiment and feeling is better studied in its so-called loan and foreign words, than in its linguistic heritage" (pp. 185-186). This view is, of course, plausi- ble, inasmuch as in the case of deliberate importation of foreign terms there is scope for the exercise of conscious volition controlled by national taste. That it is, however, in the last analysis the genius of the language itself that determines its growth is the view of the author. "In every national language there is an aesthetic will, a master builder. We do not attribute this force to a language, or invent it; it is the linguistic, individual unity of the language it- self" (p. 137). Language as thus conceived is, so to speak, itself the artist. But it is also an art, subject to the laws by which all art must be evaluated. It may be compared with architecture. "In language as in architecture all meaningful ornamentation has a utilitarian function. The more closely ornament and structure are interwoven, the more style a language will have" (p. 136). Of all the sections of the book the most interesting is the fourth</page><page sequence="4">356 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY chapter dealing with "New Forms of Thought in Vulgar Latin." Its purpose is to demonstrate the interplay between a changing language form and a changing intellectual orientation. A most fascinating series of speculations is what we are here treated to- speculations which with all their daring appear for the most part plausible. The first item of change discussed is that of word order. The simpler and more straight-forward structure characteristic of vulgar Latin is interpreted as evidence of a more objective attitude, a shift from the ego-centric to the altro-centric point of view. "In high Latin, the word order shows that the mental and spiritual interests of the speaker take first place, in Vulgar Latin those of the listener" (p. 54). "When the speaker of Vulgar Latin begins to attune his sentences to the ear of his listener rather than to his own natural inclination he begins to forsake the naive ego-centricity, individual- ism, and anthropomorphism of the classics. In his language he gradually develops the capacity for brushing aside the atmosphere of his personal feelings and entering that of others" (p. 55). A further indication of this postulated shift toward greater ob- jectivity is seen in the gradual decay of the passive form. The substitution of active for passive was a symptom of recovery from anthropomorphism, inasmuch as it was by means of the passive that states of suffering and feeling were attributed to the inanimate. Furthermore the scope and meaning of the active voice became altered as the passive voice fell into disuse. "It becomes wider, more neutral, and, as it were, more soulless. For natural events, for psychic experience, for emotional suffering and for purposive action there is only one verbal genus" (p. 56). But if new mental attitudes affected linguistic forms, these in turn were a provocation to further changes of mental orientation- "a stimulus towards a new way of looking at things. " Like the passive voice, the modal forms-supine, gerundive, and future participle-were instruments of superstition. "They all ex- press an immanent destiny, a natural fate, which is at work in the processes of the universe, in human activity, in organic life, and in events as such" (p. 59). It was only natural, then, that they too should have fallen into disuse. The widening of the domain of the indicative mood is similarly explicable. For example the use of the indicative in place of the subjunctive after quod is taken as evidence that "the interconnections of things and events were no longer felt anthropomorphically and mystically" (p. 71). It becomes ap- propriate to employ the indicative in dependent clauses because "To say or to believe something does not mean that it exists" (p. 70). That the future tense should have gone the way of these other</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 357 classical forms is to be accounted for quite simply as the result of popular tendencies. "There is hardly a language in which it [the future tense] is regularly used by the common people" (p. 61), and the reason is that the purely temporal conception of the future was always weak, the natural man's attitude being one of willing, wish- ing, hoping, and fearing. Whether the undeniable fact of the "corruption" of classic Latin warrants all the psychological implications which Professor Vossler postulates must be left to the decision of the reader. Certainly without a complete reading of this chapter the passage with which it concludes must appear unduly confident and rather wildly specu- lative. "The Latin of the common people," we are told, "moves and aspires from anthropomorphic, deterministic, intellectualistic forms of thought towards dualistic, concrete, practical, voluntaristic forms. From the mythical, pantheistic conception of the world it proceeds to the symbolic, the deeper, more psychic conception and presentation, thereby paving a way through language to the thought of the Middle Ages and of Christianity. Indeed, it is the road on which the Latin peoples progressed from antique to Christian ways of thinking" (p. 75). That the entire volume, and this chapter in particular, merits careful reading is in any case the opinion of the present reviewer. HELEN Huss PARKHTURST. BARNARD COLLEGE.</page></plain_text>
