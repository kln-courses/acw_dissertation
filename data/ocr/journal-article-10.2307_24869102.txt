In 2000, at the age of twenty-three, Nishida made a dramatic debut at the prestigious "Asahi Ceramic Competition" (Asahi togeiten). He was awarded the Incentive Prize, which is presented to the most promising young artist represented at the exhibition. Within three years, Nishida had garnered the bronze prize at the "1st World Ceramic Biennale" in Korea (2001); the Grand Prix at the "6th International Ceramics Competition" in Mino, Gifu Prefecture (2002); and the Grand Prix at Faenza, Italy, the premier international award for ceramic artists (2003). In 2005, the avant-garde artist took time away from his own production and traveled to Indonesia with two Japanese colleagues. The men were intent on working with local communities to preserve the perbot, the traditional and distinctive angled potter's wheel, and to strengthen the local ceramics industry. An electric kiln explosion in Java brought a sudden and shocking end to Nishida's life and promising career. &lt; fig. i.

Zetsu No. 8, detail of a porcelain fin projecting from central section (8c). Photo © 2014 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston The Zetsu Series Nishida's artistic reputation centered on fourteen challenging ceramic sculptures in a series entitled Zetsu (Finality), created from 2000 through 2005, the years following his graduation from Kyoto Seika University until the time of his death.1 These works are "heroic" fabrications of raw clay and glaze transformed in the intense heat of the kiln. Cleaved and manipulated after they had been fired, the subsequent excavations cut through the jagged, glassy surfaces of the massive cooled forms to reveal fins and tubes, which are sometimes embedded, sometimes free-floating. Nishida said of the series that they are "independent entities that come from the fusion of a natural and a human process of creation."2 Zetsu No. 2 (2002) now stands at the entrance to the Museum of Modern Ceramic Art in Gifu (fig. 2). The piece that secured the Grand Prix at the Ceramics Competition in Mino, Zetsu No. 2, has a rough outer surface of lavalike striations in white glaze. The geode-shaped form has been cracked open, and more luscious globs of luminous glaze ooze around sharp-edged glass projections and chalky molded porcelain fins. Although seemingly an exercise in contrasting shiny and matte-white surfaces, tinges of cobalt emerge, much in the same way that compressed snow makes glaciers appear blue. Zetsu No. 14 (2005), which had been on view at the Museum of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka, dramatically thrusts into the surrounding space (fig. 3). It appears at once like a monumental heart with multiple porcelain aortas or a turbine with pipes writhing through the thick glaze interior. Yet, the hard surface of the sculpture freezes the energy in time. Seven works from the Zetsu series are currently in collections in the United States. Five of them are small-scale pieces in private American collections; one was fabricated as part of Zetsu No. 14, then made into an independent work when Nishida took the larger piece from the kiln and finished the surface. Zetsu No. 5 (2001) was acquired by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in 2009 (fig. 4). In that sculpture, the tapered molded fins arc up from a metamorphic base; they are cushioned with a bed of rose-colored, unfired glaze. Zetsu No. 8 (2003) in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is the largest and most ambitious of the works in Nishida's series (fig. 5). Although the sculpture is displayed in three sections, each on its own pedestal, they are parts of a whole that was formed and fired as a massive rectangle of glaze and porcelain, together weighing just over thirteen hundred and sixty kilograms (three thousand pounds). The Creation of Zetsu No. 8 For Nishida, the creation of the Zetsu series at Kyoto Seika University was an exhausting physical endeavor. Images in his family's possession show the former rugby player constructing the Boston Zetsu, using the unorthodox methods that he employed throughout the series. Nishida first built a containment structure of refractory brick and iron plates to fill the entire space within IMPRESSIONS 35 87 &lt; TOP LEFT fig. 3. Nishida Jun. Zetsu No. 14. Japan.

That "container" was then packed with a solid mass of dry potassium-feldspar glaze powder into which he implanted a set of semicircular, precast porcelain fins, similar to those seen in the Minneapolis Zetsu No. 5. Nishida thus used glaze as the body of his sculpture, rather than simply as a decora tive skin. He applied it dry and not as a slurry The white porcelain fins, which constitute a relatively small percentage of the total object, were inserted "green," or without an initial biscuit firing (fig. 6). Days after the firing, Nishida and two assistants climbed inside the kiln to remove the supporting iron and brick walls with power tools, freeing the white glaze. They continued to remove the wall of bricks to reveal the surface (figs. 7, 8). However, several fire bricks remained enveloped in the sculpture, subsumed by the molten glaze; others were used later to support and balance the form (fig. 9). Once the piece was hoisted off the base (or car) of the kiln, Nishida cleaved the form into three sections (fig. 10). First, the rectangle was bisected, forming the largest section where the vertical fins project from the top. The iron base plate was left in place under this section. The remaining half was then split lengthwise, cutting the porcelain fins into a maze of interlocking, but now separated, parts. By fracturing his pieces and revealing their interiors, Nishida applies a fundamentally different attitude to the ceramic process. He continues to sculpt his works even after they are fired: cutting them open, scooping out glaze powder around the porcelain fins revealed in the core. It is not just the fired surfaces that interest him, but the changes that occur in the ceramic body itself. The fractured sculpture reveals a cross section of temperature effects from the vitrified exterior to the still powdery, unfired core, visible as differences in color, density and texture (fig. 11). fig. 7.

Courtesy Nishida Jun family The fired exterior, with walls of solid glaze of over twenty-five centimeters (ten inches) and porcelain fins slumped over and collapsed onto the roof, shows a variety of effects from the extreme heat of the kiln. Both the porcelain and glaze are deeply cracked from expansion and contraction during firing and cooling; the glaze ranges from glassy and smooth with molten swirls, to matte and flaky with coral-like platelets where it interacted with the brick walls. The pure white of the piece is broken up by surprising spots of color (pink, green and blue)—unintentional but surely welcome impurities in the glaze. Streaks of iron black also run up from the bottom of the piece, where particles of iron were carried into the glaze from the steel base plate during firing. The interior of Zetsu No. 8 was untouched by the heat, leaving a fifty centimeter (twenty-inch) core of unfired, pink feldspar glaze powder partially hollowed out to reveal the fractured continuation of the 88 HYKIN AND MORSE ; CERAMIC SCULPTURE OF NISHIDA JUN fig. 7.

Despite its inherent fragility, the powdery glaze defies gravity, hanging down like stalactites from the roof of the large section, while walls of powder support the weight of the porcelain fins (fig. 13). The Zetsu Series and Its Place in Contemporary Japanese Ceramics The monumentality of the Nishida Zetsu series and its complete freedom from any utilitarian prototype places the works at the forefront of long standing attempts by postwar Japanese ceramic artists to break with functionality and to create sculptural objects. Inspired by the works of Pablo Picasso and Isamu Noguchi, the Sodeisha group, founded by Yagi Kazuo (19x8-1979) in 1946, advocated the creation of works in clay that were not vessels; they strove to produce objets d'art, which in Japanese have been termed obuje (fig. 14). Although the immediate postwar generation articulated a distinction between potters, like Yagi, who made nonfunctional obuje, and sculptors who used clay for terracottas or ceramic sculpture, within the last ten years, the ceramics world has been increasingly insistent upon the identification of contemporary work as "sculpture."3 However, many of the avant-garde artists who have graduated from university art programs, still ground their 90 HYKIN AND MORSE : CERAMIC SCULPTURE OF NISHIDA JUN fig.

At first glance, the raw ceramic sculptures of the Kyoto artist Akiyama Yo (b. 1953) appear completely divorced from conventional ways of manipulating clay A closer examination of works such as Untitled MV-101, from the Metavoid series, reveals that they were first fashioned on a potter's wheel and fragments of thrown-forms are found throughout his works (fig. 15). The bright pastel colors and anthropomorphic shapes of Shigematsu Ayumi (b. 1958), who creates erotically charged objects, are very distant from those of traditional works, yet the objects still are based on the idea that a vessel has an interior and exterior. In defining the salient characteristics of ceramics as a distinct art form, the scholar Todate Kazuko has argued that ceramics, unlike sculpture, are formed from the outside, leaving an empty interior space.

He does not "throw," nor do the exteriors of his Zetsu series alone provide the visual interest; in Zetsu No. 8, there is a hollow interior, but also the structural porcelain skeleton. Yet, Nishida's works are ultimately deeply tied to the ceramic process. Through the powerful interaction of porcelain, glaze and kiln fire, they achieve that which Noguchi originally aspired to: the "purification of their human scent by superhuman 'time.'"5 The Zetsu series audaciously re-creates geologic time. His works, Nishida stated, "are created in much the same way as the Earth forges rocks."6 The Conservation Challenges In pushing the limits of ceramic technology, Nishida's Zetsu series brings with it a host of challenges for conservation and display—from the philosophical and aesthetic to ones dealing with physical health, safety and structural stability. These issues, amplified by the scale of the Boston piece, apply to the entire series. The treatment of Zetsu No. 8 closely followed the methods used by conservators treating Zetsu No. 5 in Minneapolis, as well 92 HYK1N AND MORSE = CERAMIC SCULPTURE OF NISHIDA JUN fig. 14. Yagi Kazuo.

Damages to the Minneapolis piece were limited to the unfired areas, while the MFA's larger group also had extensive cracks and repairs in the fired sections. None of the conservators attempted to consolidate the loose powder. For Zetsu No. 8, the greatest physical danger comes from the heavy, fired glaze walls, which are riddled with firing cracks and fissures. The cracks range from 2.5 centimeters (an inch or so) wide to a fine craquelure, all intersecting and penetrating the work. The ceiling weight of the largest section (8c) is of particular concern, as there is little to prevent its collapse. A second concern is the potential for the outward movement of the side walls, made convex by the outward forces that built up during the firing. Nishida viewed his work as "living and changing," yet, he made numerous repairs to stabilize an object with synthetic adhesives that yellowed or became opaque and crystalline over time. Earlier conservation work in Japan focused on reducing such adhesive staining and discoloration, and this work was continued at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (figs. 16,17). The insoluble adhesives, some gummy and some brittle, were swelled with solvent gels and painstakingly picked from the surface with scalpels. Where areas remained unstable, a conservation-grade adhesive was applied, either by injecting dilute solutions with a syringe or in thicker solutions bulked with inert glass microballoons to stabilize larger openings. Different issues were faced in approaching the porcelain fins. Sections of the unfired kaolin were detached when the sculpture arrived at the MFA: the two heavy fins that are shown balancing within the hollow of the IMPRESSIONS 35 93 fig. 15. Akiyama Yô.

Photo © 2014 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston largest section (8c, see fig. 11) and a fragment from another section (8a), which had broken off before shipment. Much of the unfired porcelain, heavy and lacking cohesion, is cracked and hangs unsupported in space, particularly on the right section (8b, see fig. 13). Where unfired, the kaolin is extremely matte and porous, its appearance marred by the absorption of dirt and yellowed oils from handling. As with the glaze walls, some of the fins had been previously repaired, presumably by the artist, and photographs of an earlier installation confirm that some large sections have been lost. It was possible to clean the surfaces carefully and repair the detached fragments; however, the softness of the kaolin made removal of much of the darkened adhesives nearly impossible (figs. 18,19). The appearance was improved by overfilling the repairs with the same conservation-grade adhesive fill material used on the fired glaze. Unstable gaps were also repaired with fills left slightly recessed, so they do not read as pristine surfaces. Perhaps the most obvious concern is the unfired glaze powder at the center of the sculpture: light-pink aluminum feldspar in thick walls, ranging in density from loose powder to cakelike and compact. On open display in an extremely busy museum, the angular particles would create an inhalation hazard, could be readily damaged by handling and would be impossible to clean. Various methods of conserving the powder were considered, including full-scale consolidation; however, there was a risk that such methods would cause changes in color or gloss, would be irreversible and might not be effective in the long term. Treatment of the loose powder included careful dusting and securing detached sections of dense feldspar with adhesive— otherwise, the powder remains loose and unbound. Even after conservation treatment, Zetsu No. 8 remains tenuously fragile due to the structural instabilities inherent in the object (in the conservator's vocabulary, "inherent vice"). In the artist's embrace of the power of nature, he also accepted entropy; the sculpture stands in opposition to basic physical forces such as gravity, mass and cohesion. 94 HYKIN AND MORSE : CERAMIC SCULPTURE OF NISHIDA JUN fig. 16.

Despite the challenges of conservation and display, Nishida's Zetsu No. 8 is a major monument in the history of contemporary Japanese ceramics. It is not a vessel, nor is it a work that communicates its power through its surface alone. By revealing the interior, Nishida makes his viewer intensely aware of the process of ceramics—part plan, part chance. The work is sculptural, but its strength is wholly dependent on the firing process. The Zetsu series marks the start of a unique ceramic vision that was tragically cut short. © 1.
