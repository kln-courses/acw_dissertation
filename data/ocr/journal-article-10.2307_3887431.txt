<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO TYPES OF IRON-SMELTING FURNACES ON ZIWA FARM (INYANGA) F. 0. BERNHARD On Ziwa Farm, which is adjoining the Van Niekerk Ruins in the Inyanga District, twenty-two remains of iron-smelting furnaces have been found to date. Others, earlier ones, must have existed, as iron slag deposits are found at various places, mostly in the vicinity of Ziwa Culture sites. The shape of these earliest furnaces is unknown but, from the few remains of tuyeres, whose 'bore' is much smaller than those of later sites, one may assume that their over-all size was also slightly smaller. From the still existing furnaces it is apparent that two distinctive types were in use by the Bantu- speaking inhabitants. The earlier beehive-shaped type (A-type) was replaced by the oval-shaped furnace (B-type), of which some fairly recent and undamaged structures still exist. As the process of iron-smelting was associated with many taboos, most of the furnaces are sited in isolated, sometimes almost inaccessible, places (Summers, 1958, p. 101). In most cases they are found singly, but one site on the farm contains three B-type furnaces, one of which was also used as a forge, each surrounded by its circular stone wall, while another stone circle encloses two A-type furnaces built next to each other. On one of these one can recognize the mutilated remains of a female figurine of the kind to be described below. Both A- and B-type have the circular stone wall in common. This has an inner diameter of ? 4 metres, an average height of 80 cm. and a width of up to 90 cm. The ? 60 cm. wide entrance into the circle invariably lies opposite the furnace mouth. Through lack of any evidence of post-holes, either on the stone wall or just outside of it, it is impossible to say whether the structures were also protected by a roof or not. It is known, though, that the furnaces of the BaouI6 in the Congo are roofed over by a grass cover on poles (Summers, 1958, p. 122; Cline, 1937, p. 85). A-type furnaces are generally in the shape of a SECTION (1: 20) PLAN -18 cn.-P B-TYPE T *- 84 c m.- 6() cm . - b~~~~~~~~~~~12 cm, 0 a1 3 'C11 . 120~fl cm. T H. T.". TH.~~~~~~~~~~h &lt;-60 cmn.- T.

(Plan and section as shown in sketch.) The vent on top is circular. The internal base of the furnace is saucer-shaped and clay-lined. B-type furnaces are altogether different in shape; the simpler ones are unadorned, oval structures with a tuyere hole through each side on the long axis. At ground level, below the oval vent, is in all cases a circular hole of ? 40 cm. depth (Summers, 1958, pp. 61, 119). The more elaborate B-type furnaces, of which I know three, have in front, on either side of the orifice, a leg jutting forth at an angle which causes the whole structure to resemble the lower part of a female torso. This is very much in keeping with the traditional association of iron-smelting with life-giving and procreation (Cooke, 1959). The two furnaces shown in the photographs represent both the A- and B-type, but they also show that a particular tradition in decorating the furnaces with the figurine of a naked woman existed on Ziwa Farm. The undamaged clay figurine of the B furnace shows a woman in the act of giving birth to a child. The moulding of the head seems not to have worried the sculptor unduly, but the lower parts are very realistically formed. The whole figurine conforms in every detail to the description of childbirth among the Mashona as given by Dr. M. Gelfand (1956). The figure is wholly naked with the exception of a string or a very thin girdle around the loins. This appears to represent a 'mukonde', a string of red, white and black beads of 'magical properties' which is still worn by women in the remoter parts of the country while giving birth to a child. As the B-type furnaces appear to be of late date and are, most likely, the work of the Wanyama who still live in the district, it is of great interest to find the remains of absolutely identical figurines also on A-types. While the technique of smelting may have changed and a different type of furnace come into use, the fashion of moulding this little figure was retained. Referring to the furnaces shown in the two photo- graphs, we can see, in the over-all anthropomorphic shape of the furnace and the moulded figure in the case of the B-type, two instances of magic influencing the smelting. In the A-type the figure is also present, but here a second symbolical addition may be represented by the monolith with part of its top chipped off which stands immediately besides the bellows-worker's seat at the rear of the furnace. What medium was used as flux in the smelting process on Ziwa could not be established. No lime- stone occurs in the vicinity. The iron ore seems to have been carried over a considerable distance, as the nearest source is on the eastern side of the Nyamaropa Reserve, about 10 miles from Ziwa. REFERENCES SUMMERS, R. 1958.
