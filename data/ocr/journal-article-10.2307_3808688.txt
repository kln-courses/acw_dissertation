<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wildlife Drawings. By Charles W. Schwartz. Ed- ited by Michael McIntosh. Missouri Department of Conservation, Jefferson City, Mo. 1980. 122pp. $12.00. This book offers excellent black-and-white draw- ings by an outstanding artist who is also an accom- plished wildlife biologist. He writes about his sub- jects as though they were old friends, and they doubtless are, and about his art as though it were alive-and it is. John Madson's Introduction puts the biologist- artist-cinematographer into perspective and makes you feel as though you had just shaken hands with Charlie Schwartz. The Editor's Note adds to the personal vitae of the artist and his wife, Libby, and also presents the rationale for publishing this vol- ume. The book is 303 x 405 mm, with the spine on the short side. It is an awkward size for library use, but then this book should not be filed away. More read- ers will pick it up from a coffee table and enjoy it than will retrieve it from a library shelf. The phys- ical make-up and lay out are good and the binding is canvaslike maroon cloth. The dust jacket is plain with a drawing of a coyote head and the title and author's name tastefully arranged on off-white pa- per. Repeated on the title page is the dust jacket motif. The end sheets are blank. In the book proper, the upper half of the left-hand page is usually given to an introductory sketch for the full page drawing opposite. Below the sketch on the right is CW's text on the insight into the biology portrayed in the drawing or to the relation- ship of the artist to his subject. In these vignettes the reader sees this biologist-artist as the excep- tional person he really is: easy-going, relaxed, alive to the world around him, with an attitude toward his art that could only have evolved through mutual rapport with his wild subjects. In the narrative, the artist often tells why he used a certain medium or implement; why he selected the subject or the background; and in 1 instance, how the camera is used by an artist. Incidentally, his skill with a lens rivals that of his pen or pencil. The text is sprinkled with CW-isms, like, "when I was a kid..." or speaking of small animals, "These little fellas .. ." Being unpretentious and his own man is CW's hallmark. In my opinion the first requisite to greatness for an artist is draftsmanship. Here CW excels. No art- ist I am aware of, except perhaps Harold Wiberg of Sweden, is as skillful with a pencil, and to choose between them would be difficult. In pen and ink CW ranks with F. L. Jaques. Where watercolor wash is used on several drawings (e.g., plates 8, 12, 62, and 82), they are not enhanced (say I). Because the artist is also a biologist and behav- iorist, his drawings are not sterile portraits. Each tells a story in the life of the animal; each is ana- tomically correct, ecologically profound, and often whimsical. The facial features of his animals portray the mood of the action and are not anthropomorphic caricatures. In all there are 166 individual sketches or drawings. On occasion the sketches show how the drawings developed from the idea to the final product-fascinating and informative. Geese and deer are special favorites of CW. He is critical only of waterfowl artists who paint ducks regardless of anatomical inaccuracy in the context of the action portrayed. This is a superb collection of CW's drawings. There is no doubt in my mind that this book will become a collector's item. The price is ridiculously low for this exceptional book. Need I say more?- Robert A.
