<plain_text><page sequence="1">Julie Taymor From Jacques Lecoq to The Lion King an interview by Richard Schechner On 19 March 1998 I interviewed Julie Taymor in her studio in Manhattan. At that time, Taymor's production of The Lion King was (and still is) enor- mously successful on Broadway. Taymor's career has spanned continents, ven- ues, and media from Indonesia to off-off-Broadway, from Japan to the New York Shakespeare Festival, from stage to television to film. In fact, when we met, she was busy planning her film of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus. The idea for the film grew out of her 1994 stage version. Shot in Rome and Croatia in 1998 and 1999, the film features Anthony Hopkins as Titus and Jes- sica Lange as Tamora. It is scheduled to open in late 1999. In the interview, Taymor discussed the whole range of her career-with a focus on her work with masks, puppets, and performing objects. SCHECHNER: What connection is there between your earlier work-the stuff with Herbert Blau, the years you spent in Indonesia-and work like The Lion King, The Green Bird, Fool's Fire, Oedipus, and Titus Andronicus? Some people just leave their early work behind. TAYMOR: No, no, not at all. Quite the opposite. The things that I learned when I was in Lecoq's mime school in Paris at age 16 which had to do with mask work, and then the ideographing work with Herbert Blau have stayed with me. I wasn't interested in being a mime-but I was very intrigued with the use of masks and how the body became a mask. The work at Lecoq's was about getting disciplined with the body. It wasn't just mime. It was work with the neutral mask, character masks, abstract masks. SCHECHNER: When you say you got connected to your body-I want to explore that because one of the absolutely extraordinary things about The Lion King--and about your mask work in general-is the dialogue that takes place between the mask carrier and the mask itself. TAYMOR: Really what Lecoq is about is that the body is a complete re- source you can use to express anything, including emotions-which we're used to doing as actors. But it's not about "acting" sad. What is it about "sad" that makes the body hard or soft? What rhythm does "sadness" have? So your The Drama Review 43, 3 (T163), Fall 1999. Copyright ? 1999 Julie Taymor. 36</page><page sequence="2">Julie Taymor 37 body becomes a tool. Your body's like paintbrushes. It's completely non-characterological at first. You start with the neutral mask. But then there were other ones that I found really inspiring and interest- ing. How and when can we be a fat person or a thin person? How do we get rid of what we ordinarily are? What is it about a thin person, what is it about angularity, what is it that makes someone feel thin? You should be able to transform your body. That part of Lecoq's work was amazing to me. Then there was a woman, Madame Citron [Renie Citron, a teacher at Ecole Jacques Lecoq in the early '70s], who introduced me to puppetry, which was also very great because I wasn't really interested in puppets as an art form then. I had played with them as a kid like any kid, but that was it. Madame Citron animated objects, so it was really about mime, about understanding shape, form, and substance. What is air? What is it to be air? What is it to be lead, to be heavy? Ice? What happens to a thing when something acts upon it? I might want to use a concrete image like a dripping faucet. [Taymor's voice imitates the pace and pitch of a dripping faucet:] To [pause] be [pause] a [pause] drip [pause] ing [pause] fau [pause] cet. What does that make youfeel? When Madame Citron would use a broom, you'd think about the shape of a broom and what it does, and you'd make it come alive. So we'd have dia- logues between bottles and brooms and balloons. It was wonderful. You'd start to really see-to anthro- pomorphize these things. 1. Julie Taymor as Tamsen Donner in The Donner Party (1974). (Photo cour- tesy ofJulie Taymor) SCHECHNER: Yeah. I'm smiling because you say "broom" and I'm imme- diately thrown back to- TAYMOR: To Disney! SCHECHNER and TAYMOR: Fantasia! "The Sorcerer's Apprentice!" TAYMOR: Well, what is animation? It's that you can really put life into in- animate objects. And that's the magic of puppetry. You know it's dead and therefore you're giving it a soul, a life. SCHECHNER: But how can you say that's not characterological? TAYMOR: It's anthropomorphic. But the stuff with the masks that were ab- stract wasn't about playing human characters. SCHECHNER: But what about playing an emotion? TAYMOR: First, it was just those abstract masks that were rounded, say. Then it was about having the body-purely abstractly-create the same sense of roundness. And when you do that, you feel a certain way. When you put a costume on a person, it makes them feel a certain way. So this is pushing that further. Forcing a person to get into a concrete exterior form helps them get out of themselves. That's one of the things about masks. Another thing we did with Lecoq before the masks-remember, I was only 16 at the time-was acting out concepts. Let's say you wanted to act out a landscape with your body. We would create a concept of the landscape.

When I did Titus Andronicus, for the first four or five days I didn't have the actors work on characters. I say, "Okay, let's really look at the themes of the piece, and whether it's violence, racism, blah, blah, blah." And then in an extremely ab- stract way, I have the actors create ideographs. What I find from those things, whether it's for them or for me, is a visual style for the show that I can use and work in. It also helps them understand. And, it brings the actors together without too much competition: who's the star, who's this, who's that? In- stead, all of a sudden we're all saying, "Why are we doing this piece?" In Titus it got out some pretty intense concepts. SCHECHNER: What exactly do you mean by "ideograph"? TAYMOR: An ideograph is an essence, an abstraction. It's boiling it right down to the most essential two, three brush strokes. SCHECHNER: Can you give me an example from one of your pieces? TAYMOR: The best example I can give is from The Transposed Heads, which is a piece about friendship.

I use it all the time because it's the one that people can get. It takes two people, it's not just a static image. It has a beginning, middle, and end. They came forward and stood with their feet next to each other. Let's do it together because I can't really explain it as well as I can do it. So, we stand next to each other like this, and then the arms are held up. Put your feet next to mine. And they did this very well. And then you go back until you are totally balanced, like this. Now they worked this out-you can let go now-they went like, "Hi, Joe!" "Hi, Bob!" They came in and did a kind of handshake, and then they went into this thing. And what the audi- ence sees is what? They see a heart, number one. So this ideograph was a tri- angle or a heart, depending on how you shape it. But it's also a handshake, it's got that "real" gesture, too. And it's also about balance. If I think, "Fuck you," and give one little push, you're gonna tip over! So in one beautiful, little, sculptural, kinetic move... It's not just naturalism, which we don't need in the theatre, but it's familiar enough to an audience that they'll believe it. It can operate in a naturalistic world, but heighten that naturalism to the point where it adds another layer. Now I was blown away when I saw the actors do it. You know, this was not my idea; this was the actors' idea. As a director I</page><page sequence="5">40 Richard Schechner i_-~ii~ i.ii-jii- 2. Angela (Diane D'Aquila), the love of King Deramo, designed by Taymor for her production of The King Stag (1984). (Photo by Kenneth Van Sickle) file it-knowing that this is going to be a motif. Every time Nanda and Shridaman meet, that's their concept. An ideograph is like a musical motif. And it's the actors' own unique, characterological relationship or thing. So that's one example of an ideograph, very simply, and how it operates both on an abstract and a characterological level. SCHECHNER: Now this is totally different. You said you were studying at Lecoq's when you were I6? Was it summer? Were you taken out of school? Were you living in Paris? TAYMOR: I graduated high school early and I'd been in a theatre workshop in Boston with Barbara Linden and Julie Portman. I grew up in the 1960s do- ing Living Theatre kind of stuff, creating theatre from scratch, from ideas- and I didn't feel I had any training. I knew at that time I was good in</page><page sequence="6">Julie Taymor 41 movement, I knew I wanted some physical discipline. I was too young for Lecoq's but I got enough out of it. I mean, he usually didn't take people that young. I was there for a year. If I were older I probably would have done the two-year course, but I went to college instead after one year, to Oberlin. SCHECHNER: Where you met Herbert Blau. What was the connection be- tween the Lecoq work and what you did with Blau? TAYMOR: Well, the connection is that Blau, working in the way of Grotowski and Peter Brook, was really also interested in abstraction. In get- ting to this kind of-he might have called them ideographs-that probably came from Blau. What I loved about working with Blau was he was so heady. And I was so physical and visual. In Paris I was in mime school, I didn't have to talk. I hardly spoke French, I was very quiet. Then all of a sudden with Blau, I had to do two hours of solo verbal improvisation! So he really got that out of us-me, Bill Irwin, Mike O'Connor. First year we were about 15, then it went down, for The Donner Party, to seven. And I was the physical, vi- sual person in that company. I designed, I came up with the square dance for The Donnor Party. SCHECHNER: That was your idea? A great idea. I still remember that danc- ing after all these years. TAYMOR: Blau was extremely good at pulling us into places where we weren't used to going. SCHECHNER: Now let's shift venue-to Indonesia. Did you study wayang kulit? TAYMOR: You know, I studied it before I went, in Seattle at the American Society for Eastern Arts, but I didn't go to Indonesia to study traditional arts. I went to observe. This happened a little bit due to Peter Schumann. He said I should just watch and don't assign myself to a mentor. You know I worked with Bread and Puppet one summer at Goddard. Peter saw I could sculpt. So at night I would go into the barn and sculpt, and he'd come over and give me some guidance. And then I said, "Well, I'm gonna do this. What do you suggest? Who should I be with?" And he said, "Don't do, just watch." I think he sensed there were a lot of Bread and Puppet look-a-likes and he didn't think that was so hot. Peter felt if you had your own vision it should show. Don't hook on. Don't go study bunraku and then do bunraku. He told me that if I had the opportunity to travel, I should just travel, take my time, and just watch. "Just watch." That stuck with me. I studied Japanese shadow puppetry a teeny bit here and there, but I had planned to go to Indonesia only for three months. I ended up staying a long time, but that was because I started to create my own work there. SCHECHNER: Teatr Loh, right? TAYMOR: Yeah, but that didn't happen right away. SCHECHNER: And you had the car accident, came back to the USA, and went back again to Indonesia, right? TAYMOR: I had a couple of accidents. And I was there for four years, from around 1974 to 1978-I can't remember the exact years. SCHECHNER: All in Java, or-? TAYMOR: The first two years in Java and the second two years in Bali. But I didn't start Teatr Loh until I'd been there two years. I'm sure the ideograph stuff was in there at that time. It's with me always.</page><page sequence="7">42 Richard Schechner 7- ?~P i .kgX' Z? ;_.ij f .,~ t r: E:' a.i?,," *:" ~:i ~i :" ?? :::: :: : ::-t::_ sy-,: i"i ri, ,i: :\.::::_ ( ';.

Plates 3 and 4 are the drawing and realization of Hop-Frog, the king. Plates 4 and 5 show a lady of the court. (Drawings by Julie Taymor. Photos courtesy of Julie Taymor) I'll give you another example from The Lion King. As the director I hadn't hired the designer yet, but I had to come up with the concept. My deal with Disney had three parts, the first being conceptual. If we all agreed on the con- cept I'd go to the next part. That suited me just fine because the last thing I wanted was to be enmeshed in something that I couldn't stand behind. Disney felt the same way. The ideograph for The Lion King was the circle. The circle of life. This sym- bol is the actual, most simple way of talking about The Lion King. It's the big- gest song. It's obvious. So before Richard Hudson was hired [as set designer], I already was thinking about wheels and circles. And how whatever Pride Rock was I would never do the jutting Pride Rock from the movie. I knew it had to be abstract. You had the sun, then you had the first puppet I conceived, the Gazelle Wheel. The Gazelle Wheel represents the entire concept. You know what I'm talking about? The wheels with the gazelles that leap? With one per- son moving across the stage you get eight or nine leaping gazelles. Which is a miniature, too. So you get the long-shot and the close-up. I brought the min- iature to Michael Eisner [of Disney] and I said, okay, in traditional puppet the- atre, there is a black-masking or something that hides the wheels, and you see these little gazelles going like that. The puppeteer is hidden. But let's just get rid of the masking. Because when you get rid of the masking, then even though the mechanics are apparent, the whole effect is more magical. And this is where theatre has a power over film and television. This is absolutely where its magic works. It's not because it's an illusion and we don't know how it's done. It's because we know exactly how it's done. On top of that, this little Gazelle Wheel is the circle of life. So then over and over again, with the audi- ence conscious or not, I'm reinforcing this idea of the wheel.</page><page sequence="8">Julie Taymor 43 ~:~$~ ?*.'i -L~n f :::"-:: ::;:. 6-i i: ::i:- " i j :_.::: :r ::a : : ::::: : : ::: ::::: :--ai:i -ii : : :::: --i-9i -i'ii-iiiiiiii ::::::-: .::::::: ::: iii:i: :::,:::: :::::: ::::r :: ?i-i -::::: :::j::: .. :. ::: ,i-i : ~i-iiiii':-ii SCHECHNER: Did Eisner immediately go for it? TAYMOR: Completely. He said, "Got it!" I knew then that I could do the masks on the heads. I could show the process. There are places where the mechanics are hidden, but they're not very important places. You don't see the machinery under the floor for Pride Rock, but pretty much everything else is visible. SCHECHNER: One of the things I like very much in The Lion King is the tension between what you see, what you imagine, and what you know. I've forgotten the name of the actor, but you know, the guy who plays Zazu- TAYMOR: Geoff Hoyle. SCHECHNER: He's very special. When I first saw him, I said to myself, OK, I'm going to watch him and not his puppet. But that was impossible. I kept slipping into watching the puppet. TAYMOR: It's because he puts his energy into the puppet. SCHECHNER: It was like the bunraku master puppeteer who is so good he doesn't have to wear a black cloth over his face. A double magic: you see the puppet and the puppeteer together. In that universe, God is visible. TAYMOR: I've been calling that the "double event" of The Lion King. It's not just the story that's being told. It's how it's being told. SCHECHNER: But you did that earlier, didn't you? TAYMOR: I first did it in The Green Bird where, even though the actor was all in black, I didn't put a mask on his face. I didn't want to hide his facial ex- pression because of the story-a prince transformed into a bird. So he wore black, but his costume was the costume of a prince. And he is the shadow of the bird. So the personality, the yearning to be a prince again, was always</page><page sequence="9">44 Richard Schechner there. I explored the dialectic between the puppet and the human character. So finally the bird flies away and the prince comes down; it's the same silhou- ette, only now he's got his human face and his green coat. In Juan Darien there's no speaking. There's no speaking in bunraku either, the speaking all comes from the side. The Green Bird is the first time where I had the puppeteer both visible and speaking, rather than the neutral puppeteer. SCHECHNER: The tension in The Lion King for me was in the danger that the performance might fail, that the dialectic would not hold. What makes it thrilling for a grown-up, is to see if they can all pull it off. TAYMOR: Right. Michael Eisner and the other producers, Tom Schu- macher and Peter Schneider, were very concerned in 1996 when I did my first prototypes with four characters. Michael Ovitz and the whole shebang of Disney people were there. Things weren't working like they were supposed to work. The main problem was we were working in daylight, we were ten feet away. The actors weren't secure enough to not upstage the puppets. Some of the actors were so nervous in front of this crowd that the puppets were dead. Dead. So everybody said, "Uh, you can't do it for the principal characters." And I said, "But you saw the Hyena and Pumbaa work." "Well we're frightened about it because you don't know where to look. The actor is more interesting than the puppet." So I said, "Well I agree with you. This didn't work." I knew that. But I also knew why it didn't work and I knew where it could go. See, a good thing about Disney is that they have money to do the next workshop. So I said, "Look, I hate puppets. I'm sick of them. I'm happy to do this with ac- tors, with makeup, Peking opera-style, kabuki. I don't give a shit. I've got nothing to prove. If that's the best way to tell the story, let's do it that way. But I don't think that's why you wanted to work with me." And they an- swered, "Well, you can do it for the chorus animals, but not the principals." So I said, "All right, what I'm gonna do-and this is as much for me as you, because this is the first opportunity I've had to spend the amount of money it takes to do this experiment-I'm gonna do two or three versions of each char- acter. I'll do full makeup and wig for Scar. And for Geoff Hoyle-we'd hired Geoff by then-I'll do it first with the bird and then without the bird. But we have to do it in the New Amsterdam, in a black environment, with all the lights, all the makeup, and full costumes. And you have to be 30 feet away." And that's what I did. A true experiment. And it worked. Michael Eisner said, "Let's do all the puppet stuff. Because it is definitely more risky, but the payoff is bigger." So that was it. And there were no more worries about it. SCHECHNER: Working with Disney gave you the freedom, the money, to really experiment? TAYMOR: Yeah. SCHECHNER: And once Eisner made the decision, did Disney stay out of it? TAYMOR: They stayed out of it. SCHECHNER: They didn't play producer? TAYMOR: Tom Schumacher was the producer. He was the one who asked me to do it. He was the head of the Olympic Arts Festival in L.A. before he went to Disney. Tom is really one of the best theatre producers I've ever worked with, if not the best. He knows theatre from all over the world, so he would sit there and he'd say, "Why don't you try an Awaji puppet?" Because of the Olympic Arts Festival, he's been all over the world. This is a guy who knew exactly one technique from another. And even though he's in Califor-</page><page sequence="10">Julie Taymor 45 nia, he was here in New York enough to say, "Do it Taymor style." What he meant by that was, "You don't need all that. Get it simpler." I was inter- ested-because we had the budget--in exploring high technologies. But what happened was that I came back to my beginnings. The most successful stuff is the stuff I've done my whole life, which didn't cost anything. Like the tears coming out of the eyes. Or the silk going into the water hole. Or the shadow puppets of the fish. Or the little mouse. You have that incredibly big, opening scene and the next thing you have is a little circle of light-just a hand-held light and a teeny little mouse that moves along the screen. SCHECHNER: And the birds, too. The flying birds. TAYMOR: Oh yeah, yeah. You mean the kites in act 2? SCHECHNER: Right. TAYMOR: Those are the things that I've done since I had no budgets. They have the power. In fact more power because they are so transparent, so simple. It is so pleasing to me to hear people say, "My child went home and picked up some fabric and a stick." Do you know what that's like for me? To see a child go home and run around with fabric and a stick instead of creating a bird on a computer where they're given the bluebird head and the bluebird wing, and they get the color. And that means that they haven't really understood air. They haven't understood that silk is gonna work better than velvet, you know? I think it's just shocking what's gonna happen.

The idea of sitting in front of a little box, minimizing life experience rather than making it greater. Why play on the internet when you can go outside and ride a bicycle? It doesn't have any air. I can't imagine having a child and having to fight over being outside or working on the computer. When I was at a tech/design conference two weeks ago, I insulted every- one. I started by saying, "Look at this stage. Look how ugly it is." It was filled with wires and computers. "Don't you guys even think about aesthetics? How unbearable this is?" Now I'm talking to a bunch of Microsoft guys. I mean these were the people who invented all this stuff. SCHECHNER: Right, there's something whacko about it. It's like the love- affair with the automobile. Everyone thought it was so great--you can go anywhere! But where the fuck do people go? To the mall, to the supermar- ket? The car didn't bring utopia, and neither will the microchip. I want to talk now about Oedipus and Titus Andronicus. They seem to be different from a lot of your other work in the sense that these are heavy, bloody tragedies. TAYMOR: Titus is meant to touch you, and to be emotional. SCHECHNER: Had you earlier done anything as heavy as this? TAYMOR: I did The Tempest. SCHECHNER: But The Tempest is a magic show. TAYMOR: Yes, but it's got such beautiful, deep themes in it. But you're right, it's nothing like Titus. Juan Darien is pretty dark in certain places. SCHECHNER: Yes, Juan Darie'n. But the way you did it was both dark and not. I mean, the very idea that the village was this-the scale was such that a person could literally embrace the village. TAYMOR: Right. I'm just saying that it goes to a point where the child is tortured to death and burned alive. I did Titus because Jeffrey Horowitz asked me to read it and I was shocked. I'd never been shocked by something I read before. And I thought, "Whoa! If I'm this shocked, how could someone have written this? And it's Shakespeare's first play-people think it's a bad play. I don't really know how I feel about this." People said, "Julie, you know you've done so many things with violence in them." I had. But I'd always stylized the violence. So this was one where I had to say, "You can't stylize this violence because then it becomes too pretty, too aesthetic." I don't like violence. I'm like any other normal person. But I think that the thing that drew me to Titus, and that still draws me, is that I've never seen any disserta- tion on violence as complete as Titus. Think of Braveheart or all those violent Hollywood movies. Or Richard III or Jacobean plays. What is it about Titus? You don't think about the violence in Richard III. It just happens and it goes. There's something else in Titus that gets to people, I guess because the vio- lence is so...gruesome. Cutting off hands, and tongues, and rape. It's not just smothering your wife with a pillow. SCHECHNER: Yes, the violence in Titus is celebrated. In Richard III he kills the kids because they threaten his claim to the throne. In Titus, there's a de- light in the torture. TAYMOR: By some characters. Yes, Shakespeare chose that aspect. Violence as war. Condoned violence. Ritual sacrifice. Then it has father-to-son vio- lence, which is the patriarch thing. Violence as an act of passion and anger, accepted because it was an irrational act of passion. Then violence as art,</page><page sequence="12">Julie Taymor 47 -: :': : "- ,~5~:":U"';:"~ ::: _iiii iPli: ::iliii- sii~ii :-iiii.i: Di ii :~:::':i~ ":' ::.. i:i:i:-:::::i::i 9. In Taymor's 1994 stage production of Titus Andronicus, Tamora (Melinda Mu/llins) and her lover Aaron the Moor (Harry Lennix) plot to kill Bassianus, the emperor's brother. (Photo by Kenneth Van Sickle) which is what Aaron does when he thinks about the art of violence. He's the one who's like the guy in Clockwork Orange-that kind of nihilistic violence, violence without meaning. And lust, and sex. Ultimately Titus killing his daughter, which is...Bosnia. Or whatever the latest outrage is. You can't live anymore. You've been raped by the enemy. Your life is over, you are dis- graced, you are condemned-so why live? SCHECHNER: Why did you want to do it? TAYMOR: I did it as a play because I found it just so compelling. I am so sick of stories like Pulp Fiction where you have a bunch of low-lifes being violent in a stereotypical low-life way. No real story. What I love about Titus is that you have a good man, a powerful man, your chief of state. You want him to be your president. But he behaves exactly the same as the worst of the worst. SCHECHNER: And as a movie. How will you translate it, both conceptually and physically into film? TAYMOR: In the theatre, my set designer Derek McLane and I took ancient Roman ruins and made photographic blow-ups on plastic and then we scratched it. So what you had was something grand, chintzy, and contempo- rary. I played with the Etruscan right up to the present. Costume is character, not period. I thought of Lavinia more as Grace Kelly, with the little gloves, a 1950s character. But Tamora is more like Visconti's 1930s film, The Damned.</page><page sequence="13">48 Richard Schechner She's androgynous. And Titus, he starts in black and he moves through grays to white, with a chefs hat. White, where the blood really shows. But, at a certain point when he's been completely reduced to being a pathetic old man, he's like Father Knows Best. This was Robert Stattel's idea. He said, "I feel like wearing a cardigan. You know, a frumpy cardigan sweater." Clothing became so much an emblem of status in society and what you think about yourself. I'm doing exactly the same thing in the film. SCHECHNER: You're mixing time periods? TAYMOR: Oh yeah. It's in two time periods-or maybe I should say we're creating our own time period. I can say I've never seen anything like it in film except maybe Road Warriors and Blade Runner. We're going to shoot in Rome using both the ancient Roman ruins-they have elements of modernity to them-and then we're going to use Mussolini's government center, which was modeled after the ancients. And we'll take these modern places, which have an incredible kind of minimalist power, and we'll put Roman cobble- stones down. And what we'll try to do, if we go into an ancient catacomb where they buried their dead, there might be-like in Mexico-a little photo of the character next to something that reminds you of him. In the theatre production I used the gold frame and red curtain which is symbolic of revenge dramas. I had the concept of "Penny Arcade Night- mares," all in gold and the red. In the film, the Colosseum has become the symbol. It's more cinematic. Everybody in the world knows that the Colos- seum is the original theatre of violence and cruelty. The film starts in a kitchen that could be in Sarajevo or Brooklyn. A child is watching TV. As the child's innocent play with his toy soldiers escalates into a palpably thunderous explosion of bombs, the boy falls through an Alice in Wonderland time warp, with the intervention of a Shakespearean clown, right into the Colosseum. Magically, his toy Roman soldiers have become armored flesh and blood, covered in layers of earth-Titus and his armies are returning from war with a triumphant march into the arena. The boy takes his part as Young Lucius, Titus's grandson, and it's through his eyes that the audience will witness this tale of revenge and compassion. lo.

TAYMOR: No studio! We're raising the money independently. If we can do it for 12 or 14 million, it will be a miracle- SCHECHNER: You mean you can have Hopkins in a film for that kind of budget?

But that's why she came right down to the front of the stage. The New Amsterdam was a vaudeville house and we learned that the sound is only really good at the front of the stage. SCHECHNER: This interview is going into an issue of TDR on puppets and performing objects. I wonder if you feel an affinity to American traditions of performing objects-stufflike the Macy's parade, the Disney and other theme parks. You talked about Asian arts. What about American popular arts? TAYMOR: I never liked those things. Not even as a kid. I think I always felt that that kind of thing was just goofy, literally. The roundness of everything-- the aesthetic of it-never appealed to me. When I was given marionettes as a child they were more like Czech marionettes. They weren't that four-fin- gered, big-eyed-I never liked the big-eyed types of things. Bread and Puppet was one of the first things I saw that really grabbed me, during the Vietnam War. It was that power of parade. I've never seen the Macy's parade. SCHECHNER: Over the last Io years or so, you've been making movies. Are you changing over from live performance to film? TAYMOR: Not really. I did two nonfeature films, which I enjoyed, Oedipus and Fool's Fire. And now TITUS. SCHECHNER: Do you have any theatre projects coming up? TAYMOR: Elliot [Goldenthal] and I are still working on Grendel, that's op- era. If Nigel Redden [the producer] can pull it off we'll do it in 2000. There's nothing more ridiculous than the amount of time we'll have spent to work on what will amount to a noncommercial eight performances. It's ridiculous!

TAYMOR: Not a lot of theatre producers. SCHECHNER: Why not, do you think? TAYMOR: I never had theatre producers run after me. Some people want to make more Broadway shows out of movies. But Elliot and I aren't going to do Batman: The Musical.</page><page sequence="16">Julie Taymor 51I SCHECHNER: It's interesting--plays from movies. Until recently it was the other way 'round. Now they think they already have name recognition and a proven box office. TAYMOR: And they own it. SCHECHNER: Right. They own it. TAYMOR: Name recognition definitely works. If The Lion King hadn't been a movie, there would be nothing like this. You've got children who know it. It's like the Mahabharata for our culture. These kids have it memorized. And they love it, and they say, "Mommy"-I get these stories all the time-they say, "Don't worry, Mommy. Simba's going to be okay." You know what I love about The Lion King? It's really theatre operating in its original sense, which is about family and society. It's doing exactly what theatre was born for--to reaffirm where we are as human beings in our envi- ronment. It's precisely to reestablish your connection with your family, to know what your hierarchy is. And to watch families come and go through that with their children is a very moving experience for me. SCHECHNER: Greek theatre was that- TAYMOR: And Shakespeare- SCHECHNER: Great popular theatre was always something like that. A ritual celebration, rather than "what's-going-to-happen-next?" TAYMOR: When I worked on the story of The Lion King I ultimately knew that this is a classic story. It doesn't have to be so absolutely amazing. What needs to be amazing is the telling of the story. The meaning comes in the tell- ing, not in the story itself. It's how you tell it. And everybody always talks 12.

By Eileen Blumenthal and Julie Taymor. NewYork: Harry N. Abrams, 1995; 208 pp.; illustrations. $49.50o cloth. JUL iEj_. TA T 101::ij:::::~:::i~: PT AYNi ~IJ TI 2IREn~~on : Julie Taymor's work is highly visual, lush even, saturated with color, pulsing with rhythmic movement. This large-format book shows Taymor as a visual theatre artist. Fifteen perfor- mances, from Way of Snow (1974) through Titus Andronicus (I994), are presented in photographs, drawings-often enough Taymor's working sketches-and brief processual and descriptive texts in which Taymor ex- plains the why and how of each work. Preceding this chronological march through Taymor's oeuvre is a 46-page biographical and analytic essay by Eileen Blumenthal. What the material reveals is the consistency of Taymor's vision. Some artists, like Picasso, change their styles and modes of presentation radically as they move through life; others, like Richard Foreman, remain very fixed. Taymor falls between these extremes. She varies her texts, media, and place in the production hierarchy-sometimes working as director-designer-adapter, sometimes just being in charge of the visuals, and often serving as both director and designer. She constructs her puppets, masks, and performing objects. But for all the changes, her basic style remains recognizably her own throughout. Blumenthal points out that Taymor's work: is not so much eclectic as it is cross-bred. She draws on an enormous pool of forms, genres, traditions. [...] Usually she assimilates disparate elements rather than leaving them in native dress. Only historians of European theater might notice how closely the stage arrangement in Taymor's design for a Passover Haggadah pageant resembles that of me- dieval Christian Passion plays. Only viewers familiar with Chinese the- about this crying. The most common statement is, "The giraffes came on and I burst into tears." From adults. You know, children don't say that. And you ask, "Why is that?" I remember having a disagreement with Richard Hudson over how to do the sunrise. I won because I'm the director. He wanted to use projected light, which of course you can do. But I said, "Then you might as well use a movie because a film clip can do it even realler." Then I said, "It's the beginning of the show. I can't do that. I've gotta establish the rules of the game at the beginning. I just want it to be flat, and I want it to be clearly pieces of silk, on the floor. So that when the audience looks at it, they go, 'Oh-it's just pieces of silk on flats going up and down.'" And the giraffes were the second thing I designed. I said, "Sure, I could hide those people in a costume with stilts." But then no one would feel anything. The fact that as a spectator you're very aware of the human being with the things strapped on, and you see the straps linking the actor to the stilts, that there's no attempt to mask the stilts and make them animal-like shapes-that's why people cry.</page><page sequence="18">Julie Taymor 53 ater would be likely to realize that the show's Red Sea of billowing cloth derives from a Peking Opera convention. Taymor's Juan Darien incorporates techniques from Japan, Indonesia, Czechoslovakia, and Western fairgrounds [...]. (7-8) Taymor is a theatre artist who emerges from a rigorous academic and adventurous intercultural background. As a teenager she trained in mime with Jacques Lecoq; as a college student at Oberlin she joined Herbert Blau's experimental group, Kraken. I saw Kraken perform The Donner Party at the Performing Garage in the early I970s. Taymor played various roles, human and animal, with a great physical intensity drawing fully on her mime training. But Blau's work was not only artis- tic. He demanded from his actors intellectual commitment. Taymor was well-prepared for her experiences in Indonesia later in the 1970s. Half a world away from the USA she learned first-hand how to form a theatre company; she experimented deeply with masks and puppets. Because of her great gifts as a costume designer and mask and puppet maker, Taymor found herself slotted as a "visual artist" in the theatre. But her ambitions were much broader. As success in one area opened up opportunities in others, Taymor was able to direct more often and to work across genres in theatre, television, opera, and film. Blumenthal's introduction follows Taymor's progression. There is not much deep analysis or attempt to locate Taymor within the whole spec- trum of modern American theatre. Taymor's enormous success in The Lion King takes place a few years after this book was published. But the seeds of that success are well noted. Taymor's own writing in the book sticks fairly close to the various grounds she stands on-narratively, the- atrically, technically. Taymor is not given to theorizing or comparing herself to others. To some degree Taymor is unique. Peter Schumann has kept strictly to his origins in the counter-culture. The Muppets are popular puppetry par excellence. Taymor has emerged from the avantgarde into the mainstream. What this excellent book shows most clearly is how Taymor has happily realized her ambition to be a direc- tor: the person who conceives and executes what happens onstage, whatever the medium. -Richard Schechner SCHECHNER: Earlier in your work, you were your own designer, weren't you? TAYMOR: You mean sets? Not always. SCHECHNER: Well, like in Juan Darien, who designed the village? TAYMOR: We codesigned the set, Skip [G.W. Mercier] and me. The actual look of the village is Skip's. My concept, his realization. SCHECHNER: And in The Lion King, you had a costumer? TAYMOR: No, I designed the costumes. The puppets and the masks are codesigned by Michael Curry and myself. I am the aesthetics director. I sculpted everything, I drew everything. He did the mechanics. Sometimes he did the visuals, but our balance together is really technical and aesthetic. Ri- chard Hudson did the sets. I gave him some basic concepts like the circles. I said to him, "You're a minimalist, that's perfect, because the puppets are</page><page sequence="19">54 Richard Schechner gonna be so rich. I need a minimal background." He's a white guy from En- gland born in Africa, spent his first 17 years there. Which brings me to the only other thing that I want to say about The Lion King, something particularly important to me. The production is very inter- esting when you think about race in America. For white people, The Lion King has nothing to do with race. It's beyond race. It transcends race. For black people, it's the opposite. It's all about race. SCHECHNER: How's that? TAYMOR: First of all, when you see the movie of The Lion King, unless you're an adult you have no idea that the voice of Mufasa [James Earl Jones] is an African American. In my production you see the actors in flesh and blood. Technically, the entire chorus is nonwhite-some of them look white, but they are of mixed race. You have a nonwhite cast onstage for the most part. And for a black child-black papers have written about this-the re- sponse from the black audience has been rewarding and moving. In American mainstream theatre, a black king is nowhere to be found. SCHECHNER: Right. TAYMOR: Never! To have Mufasa played by a black actor. In the movie, Matthew Broderick was Simba's voice. Okay, so we had a black father and a white son. Why didn't they cast a black actor to do the voice of Simba? I didn't intentionally have two light-skinned people playing those parts; they were the best actors for the roles. Our other Simba who's playing it now is very black. The black audience sees race onstage. Now I know my work isn't African, but Lebo's music [Lebo M] is African. The Lion King isn't about racism the way, say, Ragtime or so many other plays with black performers are. In this regard, The Lion King is totally refresh- ing--a kind of glimpse of the future. My friend Reg E. Kathay said, "This is like the next century." But no one in the white press ever talks about the race issue in The Lion King. I think one article in L.A. brought that up. SCHECHNER: But the black press talked about it? TAYMOR: Oh, yeah. SCHECHNER: Is the story itself an African story? 13. Giraffes (Timothy Hunter and Ashi K.

This is a Western story. What is very African about The Lion King is Lebo's music. The visuals, too, the textiles. And Garth Fagan's choreography. I picked Garth be- cause I wanted something real cross-cultural, very European and African, or American-European and African. I liked that Garth is a contemporary chore- ographer from Jamaica. He has the roots and he knows African idioms, but he's doing his own modern stuff. SCHECHNER: Anything else? TAYMOR: You know what, I'd love to make a film of my The Lion King. SCHECHNER: A film of a play based on a film? TAYMOR: It's different! First of all, the movie only had five songs. And the faces of the people are very compelling. We're not talking animation. SCHECHNER: But would Disney do that? TAYMOR: Not right now. They don't want to ruin the box office. And then I thought, maybe we could shoot it in Africa. But what I can't quite fig- ure out is this: the whole reason to stylize is because you're not in a real set- ting. So how do you do the Serengeti in the Serengeti? It would be fantastic to have the Serengeti, and then out of the ground, the land starts rising up, and there are the people. Or take a real cave and literally paint the cave with slashes like we did onstage. So that you stylize the natural. I mean, you liter- ally treat the land and maybe you color the grass. We could film from heli- copters, you know, or any angle. It could be amazing to try and figure this out. I don't even know what it would look like to have real giraffes moving by fake giraffes. I know it's completely the opposite of what it's supposed to be, and what its success is in the theatre, but there's something very compel- ling and interesting to me about having the real, and then having the stylized. It's a musical. I mean, it's not like you're pretending to be really real. Richard Schechner is TDR's Editor.
