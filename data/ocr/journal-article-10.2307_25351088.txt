<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science and Philosophy Sir,?In your issue of March 18th (p. 488) Professor H. E. Magee says: " If . . . it is conclusively shown that a particular biological process occurs in a way con trary to physico-chemical laws, the phenomenon should be regarded as a fact." The logic of his statement is as irrefutable as is that in the assumption : "If it is con clusively shown that epilepsy is due to green goblins in the Gasserian ganglion the phenomenon should be regarded as a fact." Following his line of reasoning the professor proceeds to divide the body into two sets of organs and tissues?those that function in accordance with chemical and physical laws, and those that function contrary to them?adding that " very many bodily functions fall into the latter category." He apparently justifies himself for this startling classification on the grounds that in the former the " how " of the functioning is known, in the latter it is not. -The physicist does not know the " how " of a falling apple ; all he does know is that the mutual approach of earth and apple is dependent upon an " attraction " between the two bodies that is directly proportional to their mass-product and inversely propor tional to the square of their distances apart. He does not, however, on that account segregate gravitation in a cate gory "contrary to physical laws" apart from other cosmic phenomena the " how " of which is known. In view of the indubitable fact that every biological dis covery has been arrived at from the mechanistic stand point, the mechanophobia of certain biologists is difficult to understand, unless, indeed, they too have fallen victims to that epidemic malady which has been affecting physical science during the last two decades, and which Professor</page><page sequence="2">586 April 1, 1933] CORRESPONDENCE r theBritis? L Medical Journal Schroedinger has called ' ' Umsturzbed?rfnis ' '?the mania for kicking against the established order of things. Whether in the days of the " rampant materialism " of the last century or in the days of the present century, with its no less rampant neo-vitalism, holism, emergence, entelechy, elan vital, puissance dormitive, and indeter minism, the guiding principle of all biological research has ever been mechanism. However mystic his trend outside the laboratory the biologist works on the assumption that the phenomenon confronting him is an effect of an imme diately antecedent cause, that the totality of phenomena constitute a cyclic cause-effect sequence ; in short, he knows that only with the mechanistic key can he hope to unlock the secrets of living matter. Yet, despite the fact that we owe all the * fruits of science to attacks on the unknown via the mechanistic approach, explanations of biological phenomena in terms of mechanism invariably at first arouse fierce opposition, though ultimately they are universally accepted. Professor Magee suggests that physiologists should rest satisfied with calling biological processes " physiological." Provided the tautology?for it amounts to that?is re stricted to biology qua biology, no exception need be taken to the expedient, but once the biologist enters the controversial field of epistemology it is imperative that he should show his colours, and this can only be done if the " old shibboleths " " mechanism " and " vitalism " are retained. The professor appears to find solace in the imperfections of knowledge and in the limitations imposed on human effort and inquiry, but, as Dean Inge once remarked, " Those who take refuge in gaps find them selves in ? tight place when the gaps begin to close." Ignorance of the modus operandi of a phenomenon is no excuse for anthropomorphism, and to seize on some few phenomena not as yet capable of being mapped out in the vast territory of the known and mechanically explainable, and to relegate them to some mystical realm outside and beyond the physico-chemical, is surely an exhibition of disloyalty to that principle of continuity which science has invariably found underlying all nature.?I am, etc., Charles M. Beadnell, Ringwood, Hants, Surgeon Rear-Admiral R.N. (ret.). March 25th. Sir,?In his letter in the Journal of March 18th (p. 488) Dr. H. E. Magee has stated our aim as the determination of the method by which any organism or tissue operates, and we must inevitably agree with him that if and when any biological process is conclusively shown to. occur in a way contrary to physico-chemical laws the phenomenon should be regarded as a fact. Obviously, even the most convinced mechanist must yield this agreement, if only in a theoretical or formal sense and qualified by the condition that the supernatural demonstration to which it refers is an absurdity. Dr. Magee states that very many bodily functions fall into the category of reactions con trary to physical and chemical laws ; from his context one presumes and hopes he really means that this contra diction is one not real and absolute, but apparent and temporary, and referring only to the contemporary state of physical knowledge. If this is so he is to be envied his rational detachment from the main controversial field ; if not, one is compelled instantly and almost without apology to defend the mechanist philosophy in relation to science. With Teufelsdr?ckh well may we ask, "What are the Laws of Nature? " Surely no process, physio logical or other, of whatever degree of complexity, can lead to denial, but only to confirmation. True determinism has been periodically hindered by the development of a self-satisfied and incomplete mechanism, or, in medicine, a premature iatro-chemistry or -physics, and the dignity of its philosophy has been frequently injured by false associations with the baser political, social, and scientific materialism of the last century, to which Dr. Magee refers. But the larger creed is one of endless inspiration, and its tenets have been expressed nowhere more satisfyingly than by Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell in his Herbert Spencer Lecture : " The theory known as Materialism assumes that the pheno mena of life are special cases of the phenomena o? matter, that is to say, that if we knew all the chemical and physical factors implicated in any living phenomenon, we could predict the result with the same certainty as when we know the factors in a lifeless material arrangement. . . . The magnitude which cells, tissues, and whole organisms can attain, the rate of their growth, their form, the deposition of skeletal excretions, the arrangement of leaves, the spirals of shells and of horns, the shape of eggs, the relation of form to mechanical efficiency, and a thousand other recurring details of structure require no vital principle to explain their existence. They are the inevitable consequences of mechanical conditions, driving life in defined and determined directions." Professor A. J. Clark, in his Lister Lecture, has drawn attention to the impression that the simpler the living system studied the more does its behaviour appear as inexplicable by the laws of physical chemistry as at present known. But surely such characters as specific reproduction, apparent purposive response, continuity of energy exchange, or even consciousness itself, may also be regarded as attributes of systems?in the lowest forms of life as in the higher?differing only quantita tively from simple physical ones in their gigantic com plexity and in the overwhelming intricacy of their associative and correlative mechanisms. The superficial resemblances between mechanism and predestination on the one hand, and between vitalism and free will on the other, may in this light disappear if we con ceive an organization on physical lines so colossal as to admit the possibility of its responding by alternative or selected and centrally controlled reactions to a single stimulus. " The house is there that men may live in it ; but it is also there because the builders have laid one stone on another." And the game of the study and interpretation of life is one which vitalist, holist, or entelechist must inevitably lose.?I am, etc., Edinburgh, March 21st. ALEXANDER HaddoW.</page></plain_text>
