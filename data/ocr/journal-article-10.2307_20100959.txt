Springer 2005 The beginning of modern Jewish historiography: Prague - A center on the periphery LOUISE HECHT* The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel E-mail: lhecht@h2. hum. huji. ac. il Abstract. This paper questions the well-established view that modern Jewish historical writing began in Germany about 1820, with the Wissenschaft des Juden tums. Following a summary of various scholarly discussions of this issue, attention shifts to Prague. Prague was a center of Jewish historical writing before the birth of Wissenschaft, and the historical narratives of three distinct Bohemian mask ilim, Peter Beer (1758-1838), Salomo L?wisohn (1789-1821), and Marcus Fischer (1788-1858) are shown to illustrate the options available to Jewish historians before institutionalized German historicism came to dominate the field. No less important, it becomes clear that scholars should treat Prague as a center of Jewish historical production, which they have not done in the past. When this paper (without its current subtitle) was first presented at a conference on German Jewish history, the Chair introduced it by pointing to the peripheral position of Prague within the whole of Ger man speaking Jewry. From a twentieth century viewpoint, there was truth in what he said. His statement seems less plausible though in historical perspective. What is it - thinking in geographic and linguis tic terms - that makes Prague, at the end of the eighteenth century, more peripheral then K?nigsberg? Yet few would associate K?nigsberg with "periphery." The question is even more puzzling when asked in the context of Jewish historiography, for, in fact, the Chair's comment reflects established scholarship's ambivalence toward new agendas. As opposed to the once common "German Jewry," the Chair's use of "German speaking Jewry" encourages broadening discourse and reflects current sensibilities to German cultural variety. By contrast, stressing * The paper was presented under the title "The Ramshak-Chronicle and the Beginning of Modern Jewish Historiography in Bohemia" at the conference " Toward Normality?" Patterns of Assimilation and Acculturation within German Speaking Jewry, organized by the Leo Baeck Institute in Cambridge (U.K.) in September 2001. I would like to thank the organizers and participants of the conference for the stimulating discussions and remarks. Moreover, I am especially grateful to Martin Wein for his inspiring comments on this paper. I am particularly indebted to my teacher Michael Silber for reading through several versions of the manuscript and offering his valuable advice.</page><page sequence="2">348 LOUISE HECHT the "marginal position" of Prague perpetuates the traditional narrative and reduces the value of novel contributions. Postmodernist concepts during recent decades have nevertheless in creased skepticism toward previous master narratives. In their recent book, J?dische Geschichtsschreibung heute, Michael Brenner and David N. Myers have specially emphasized this point;1 Myers stresses the outcome - self-reflection regarding the ideological premises of Jewish historiography2 - while Brenner focuses on the process itself.3 Brenner carefully describes how professionalizing and the disintegration of meta narratives caused by the crumbling of ideologies have led to a seemingly infinite fragmentation of historical narratives. Both Brenner and Mey ers feel that these developments have paved the way for a greater receptiveness toward hitherto ignored fields and rejected concepts in Jewish historiography. The influence of literary theory in particular, with its focus on the intrinsic qualities of the text, enables critically reviewing master narratives and encourages reappraisal of neglected sources. This paper seeks to challenge the well-established view that modern Jewish historiography began in Germany about 1820, with the Wis senschaft des Judentums. I will begin with a short summary of various scholarly discussions dealing with the emergence of modern Jewish his torical writing, with the goal of elucidating their underlying premises. Then, I will shift attention to Prague as a center of such writing before the advent of Wissenschaft. In the core of the paper, I will examine different historical narratives as used by three Bohemian maskilim in order to illustrate the many options available to Jewish historians be fore the methodological rigidity of institutionalized German historicism became dominate. Finally, I will suggest why Prague, too, should be considered a center of Jewish historical production. I. "The emergence of historical consciousness in modern Judaism," states Ismar Schorsch in a seminal paper in 1983, "comprises a fundamental change in mentality and epitomizes the dialectic process of Western ization that transformed medieval Ashkenazic Judaism." It was "an intellectual revolution" that translated "the ideas, institutions, and values of an ancient oriental religion into equivalent or related West ern categories."4 In addition to the Orientalism that resonates in this citation, Schorsch is building on the following assumptions: First, the formation of modern Judaism constituted a decisive and irrevocable</page><page sequence="3">MODERN JEWISH HISTORIOGRAPHY 349 break with traditional Jewish values; second, the break was brought about after 1820, by scholars of the Wissenschaft des Judentums-, and, third, that it was brought about through a developing "historical con sciousness," which was a product of the scholarly application of criti cal historical method, meaning that modern historiography and Wis senschaft were linked by an indissoluble tie. Schorsch's taxonomy of Wissenschaft ideology: the perception of time as a dynamic factor, a critical approach toward religiously relevant texts, equal treatment of Jewish and non-Jewish sources, scholarship as objective, and ab stract, conceptual thinking as opposed to the concrete, text-oriented exegesis of traditional Jewry, offers a potential register of the principal characteristics of modern Jewish historical writing.5 A year before the publication of Schorsch's paper, Yosef H. Yerushalmi publsihed his influential Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory.6 Like Schorsch, Yerushalmi linked the emergence of modern Jewish historiography to the Wissenschaft des Judentums, which he perceived as an unprecedented and sudden break: It should be manifest by now that [modern Jewish historio graphy] did not derive from prior historical writing or his torical thought. Nor was it a fruit of a gradual and organic evolution, as was the case with general modern historiography whose roots extend back to the Renaissance. Modern Jewish historiography began precipitously [... ].7 But contrary to Schorsch's optimism about this "intellectual revolu tion," Yerushalmi voiced "discontent."8 According to Yerushalmi, the uneasiness of Jewish historians arises from an unyielding conundrum. The scholarly investigation of the Jewish past, which Yerushalmi iden tifies with modernity, is intrinsically opposed to the collective memory of the Jewish people, which Yerushalmi links to traditional Jewish life and belief.9 Relying on the concepts of the French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs, Yerushalmi demonstrates the inherent distinction between collective memory and modern historiography. Whereas memory, which is primarily a design of the present, selects meaningful events from the past in order to foster Jewish identity, historical writing disregards the present as best it can and seeks to reconstruct the whole of Jewish history, including the parts that collective memory has deliberately banished. The subtext is clear. By stressing the different motives and strategies prompting the creation, or preservation, of memory and his tory, Yerushalmi is pointing to an irreconcilable opposition between tradition and modernity.</page><page sequence="4">350 LOUISE HECHT Amos Funkenstein sought to mitigate this strict dichotomy. In his "Collective Memory and Historical Consciousness," he argued that the impetus behind both collective memory and historiography was basi cally the same and reflected the same mentality.10 The work of the historian merely reproduces the mentality of his reference group, to which the historian him or herself naturally belongs. By stressing a particular narrative, the historian evidences the aspirations of his or her peer group. However, in order to avoid blurring the border between history and collective memory, Funkenstein introduced an additional interpretative element, namely "historical consciousness," which he de fined as "the degree of creative freedom in the use and interpretation of the contents of collective memory."11 Although traditional Jewry did not write history, it nevertheless demonstrated a well-developed historical consciousness, especially in halakhic interpretation. Such a perception of historical consciousness helps bridge the gap between modernity and tradition.12 A similar perception underlies Shmuel Feiner's book Haskalah and History, published in 1995. Schorsch and Funkenstein virtually ignore the Haskalah-movement, while Feiner specifically focuses on Haskalah's attitude toward the past, whose historiographie awareness he meticu lously scrutinizes. Yet like Yerushalmi, Feiner concludes that the mas kilim, as opposed to their non-Jewish counterparts, did not develop a modern theory of history.13 Feiner argues that the modern Jew ish historical consciousness developed along two distinct and unre lated tracks, namely, a discreetly maskil approach alongside that of the Wissenschaft.14 The maskilim's main effort was directed toward inner-Jewish reform, which is why they wrote in Hebrew. In addition, thanks to their autodidactic formation, the scholarly value of their work is limited. They failed to develop a true historiography, and their historical treatises were soon forgotten. Scholars from the circle of the Wissenschaft des Judentums channeled most of their energies toward the outside world. Consequently, they wrote in German with the intention of justifying the place of Jews and Judaism within modern nation-states. Likewise, they constructed comprehensive histories of the Jews, embracing the perceptions and methods of German idealism as well as German historicism.15 Whereas historiography remained the preserve of the Wissenschaft des Judentums, the concept of historical consciousness served Feiner to mediate between pre-critical scholarship and Wissenschaft and, ul timately, between tradition and modernity. However, Feiner, unlike Funkenstein, does not use this concept indiscriminately for a pre- Wis</page><page sequence="5">MODERN JEWISH HISTORIOGRAPHY 351 senschaft-aititude to the past. He applies it specifically to the Haskalah. At the same time, his "Nineteenth-Century Jewish Historiography: The Second Track," published in 1994, presents an interesting twist.16 In a deliberate attempt to free modern historiography from the dom inance of the Wissenschaft des Judentums, Feiner states that nine teenth century Jewish historiography "in reality encompassed at least three major tracks:" the "higher historiography" of the Wissenschaft des Judentums written in German, Eastern European maskilic (or "secondary") historiography written in Hebrew, and, finally, Orthodox historiography.17 By using the term historiography for both the traditional and mod ern approach to history, Feiner in some way blurs the line between the two. I do not mean to suggest that Feiner had changed his mind or completely revised his views within a single year; in fact, his views had not changed at all, which is indicated by his leaving linguistic and geographic distinctions intact: German versus Hebrew, and Germany as opposed to Eastern Europe. The apparent blurring seems rather to be a byproduct of his attempt to challenge the powerful master-narrative of the Wissenschaft des Judentums as the only legitimate representative of modern Jewish historical writing. The power of this master-narrative becomes especially obvious when detected in texts that seemingly try to avoid it. Reuven Michael's book entitled Jewish Historical Writing: From the Renaissance to the Modern Time18 at first seems to intimate the sort of continuity in Jewish histor ical writing which Yerushalmi denies. In fact, without explicitly saying so, Michael maintains a Yerushalmi-style dichotomy that does not trace the roots of modern Jewish historiography back to the Renaissance. Michael distinguishes between "historiography," which he discerns in both the Renaissance and in the Wissenschaft des Judentums,19 and the less essential "historical writings" of maskilim in the eighteenth century and at the beginning of the nineteenth. A different and rather original path was taken by Michael A. Meyer in "The Emergence of Modern Jewish Historiography," first published in 1988.20 Meyer points to the two-fold rationale in the modern con cern for history. It might "serve to liberate the Jew from tradition by historicizing it," but it might also "create a new attachment to the past by re-conceiving it as a model or anchorage for the present."21 Concentrating on the potential benefits of the study of history, Meyer creates a new paradigm that allows for a slightly different categoriza tion of historical writings and helps to dissolve the dichotomy between Haskalah and Wissenschaft des Judentums. In this context, it seems</page><page sequence="6">352 LOUISE HECHT noteworthy that Meyer conceives neither Haskalah nor Wissenschaft des Judentums as a sudden break or revolution. For him, the process toward the "modernization of European Jewry" was a gradual one. The studies just reviewed suggest a congruence between the views of their author on the formation of modern Judaism and their stance vis ?-vis the emergence of modern Jewish historiography. Those who regard modernity as a sudden break or revolution tend to deny the existence of modern historical writing before the advent of the Wissenschaft des Judentums altogether.22 Authors who consider the emergence of modernity as evolutionary, nevertheless, deem pre- Wissenschaft texts as second-rate historiography at best, with post-Hegelian German schol arship continuing to set the standards. This approach matches that of German historiography, in which eighteenth century historical writing until less than twenty years ago has often been rejected when judged by nineteenth century historiographical norms. In "The European Con text of Eighteenth-Century German Enlightenment Historiography,"23 Georg Iggers reassessed the achievements of eighteenth century histo riography by pointing to the University of G?ttingen as an important center for the development of historical research. G?ttingen histori ans and philologists such as Johann Christoph Gatterer, August Lud wig Schl?zer and Johann David Michaelis, Iggers writes, successfully combined Enlightenment and historicism and thus formed the link to nineteenth century historiography. Iggers goes on that scholars like Friedrich Meinecke, who sought to highlight the uniqueness of historical science produced in the nineteenth century, intentionally neglected this 24 group. ^ Bearing in mind all these attempts to decipher the nature of in cipient modern Jewish historical writing, I now turn to another cor pus of writings, which were produced in Prague at the end of the eighteenth century and in the early nineteenth. These writings have their own rationale and context, whose analysis, I hope, will allow us to reassess Jewish historical writing before Wissenschaft's advent. In particular, by disconnecting Jewish historiography from German idealism and historicism, as Iggers did for non-Jewish historiography, I wish to show that pre- Wissenschaft Jewish historical writing is of special interest, because it availed itself of a variety of options. Much as Ruth Kestenberg-Gladstein25 and Iveta Vondr?skov?,26 and in a certain sense, also Michael A. Meyer,27 Reuven Michael28 and Shmuel Feiner29 before me, I will challenge the predominance of the German narrative and the pride of place accorded Wissenschaft historical writ ing. This I will do by shifting the geographical focus; hence, my strong</page><page sequence="7">MODERN JEWISH HISTORIOGRAPHY 353 reservation about how terms like "periphery" and "center" are em ployed. One of the largest Jewish settlements until the second half of the nineteenth century and among the few cities West of Poland with a continuous Jewish population since the Middle Ages, Prague was a center for traditional Jewish learning. Additionally, at the turn of the nineteenth century, it had become an important center of Haskalah, attracting maskilim from all over the Habsburg Empire. As Michael Silber has convincingly argued, in the Habsburg context, it was Prague, not Berlin, that served as cultural model.30 It is no mere coincidence that the maskilim about to be discussed, Peter Beer, Salomo L?wisohn and Marcus Fischer, were born in differ ent places of the Habsburg Empire, eventually to migrate to Prague, where they spent a considerable, and often the formative, period of their lives. Contrary, furthermore, to the distinction Feiner has proposed between maskilim and Wissenschaft scholars, these maskilim received a formal education in secular subjects besides a traditional Jewish school ing. Their involvement in Jewish and non-Jewish spheres was balanced, they published in German, as well as Hebrew, and they certainly went beyond the limits of the maskilic approach to history to develop a veritably modern historiography, albeit on a different scholarly level that of Wissenschaft scholars. Unlike what most modern scholars have said, the different approach to history of maskilim and Wissenschaft scholars is on the whole paral leled by methodological differences between eighteenth and nineteenth century historiography in Germany.31 The Prague maskilim thus played no less important a role in the development of modern Jewish histori ography than did the G?ttingen historians Iggers discusses for modern German historical writing. Further, each of these maskilim intended to write a comprehensive history of the Jews. None of them succeeded. However, even contemplating a comprehensive "national history" was more than their Jewish and non-Jewish peers in Germany dared to envision, even after 1800.32 The truth, moreover, is that despite certain flaws that were the product of methodological inconsistency and a sometimes-dubious ap proach to sources, the scholarly limitations of the writers we are about to meet provide part of the attraction of their work. Written before the emergence of the Wissenschaft des Judentums and unlinked to Ger man idealism, their works are characterized by neither methodological rigidity nor diffidence toward creativity. The interest of these writers in geographical studies and their special concern for the periphery also testify to an awareness that environment and social structures consid</page><page sequence="8">354 LOUISE HECHT erably influence the past, an awareness that is rarely found in the texts of Wissenschaft scholars. In contrast, many qualities of the Prague Jewish writers can as well be found in German historiography of that time. The German historian Otto Dann has ascribed this open approach to history's being as yet unestablished as an academic discipline and, hence, free from limitation to a single method or canon.33 What is more, because of their varying agendas, some of the Jewish texts vibrate with insights that have been suppressed by the dominant narrative of Wissenschaft historiography. II. Peter Beer, the senior member of our group, was born around 1758 in Novy Bydzov, about 50 miles North-East of Prague.34 In his auto biography, he writes that he received a traditional Jewish education, but also studied German and Latin with his hometown priest. After some years as a private tutor in Hungary, he came to Vienna in the early 1780s, in order to complete his secular Bildung and to enroll in a teachers' seminary.35 Enthusiastic about the modern German-Jewish schools founded by Joseph II in the Habsburg Empire, Beer decided to dedicate his life to the education of "modern Jews." Besides becoming a teacher, Beer wrote textbooks on various Jewish subjects. In 1811, he was appointed as Morallehrer at Prague's prestigious German-Jewish school, where he taught until his death, in 1838. Like all maskilim, Beer assigned the Bible a pre-eminent role in Jewish education. His first book Toldot Israel, published in Prague in 1796,36 was meant, as the preface says, to prepare small boys for the Bible study in the heder.37 Toldot Israel contains historically relevant, narrative elements of the biblical account and covers the period from the creation to the return from the Babylonian Exile. The book was written in biblical Hebrew with a German translation printed with Hebrew letters, as was common in more conservative maskilic publi cations. The numerous exegetical and pedagogic footnotes in German sought to enlighten traditional teachers, as well as the student. Although Beer wanted to encourage language studies, the book substantially differs from Hebrew language readers compiled by other maskilim at this time.38 Other textbook authors stated explicitly that history was not their main concern. Toldot Israel presented itself as a history book meant to foster modern Jewish self-consciousness. Beer's purpose seems to have paralleled that of many popular historical jour nals that appeared in Germany in the second half of the eighteenth</page><page sequence="9">MODERN JEWISH HISTORIOGRAPHY 355 century, whose aim was to inform the enlightened bourgeoisie about its history in the hope of strengthening bourgeois self-conscious ness.39 The narrative of Toldot Israel seems to follow the biblical account closely, but Beer manages to make his point by slightly shifting the emphasis. Thanks to his maskilic Weltanschauung, he omitted tales about angels, miracles and other supernatural events, as well as de scriptions that might have encouraged an anthropomorphic view of God. The tendency to sanitize the biblical account and to adjust it to late-eighteenth century bourgeois moral standards is transparent. Accordingly, wherever possible, Beer excluded stories about polygamy, incest, adultery, slaughter, and fanaticism. He also chose the version among parallel biblical accounts that to him, at least, seemed most credible - or best suited his aims.40 He sought to turn history into a source of national identification. Albeit he never questions Divine Providence, the central protagonist of Toldot Israel is unmistakably the Jewish people. As a whole, Toldot Israel seems the epitome of the maskilic attitude toward history rather than the beginning of a new historiography. Yet, the book assumes a different meaning when read alongside its alleged continuation, Geschichte der Juden, written in German and published in Vienna in 1808.41 Geschichte der Juden, essentially covers the period of the Second Temple and is based on the account of Flavius Josephus.42 But the book is more than a German continuation of its predecessor. As the language shift from Hebrew to German indicates, Geschichte der Juden addresses a different audience. Toldot Israel aimed at en lightening traditional Jewry. In Geschichte der Juden, Beer turned to enlightened readers, Jews and non-Jews alike.43 Beer also strove to comply with the demands of critical scholarship and modern his toriography. But since he knew his methodological limitations,44 he decided to dress his venture as a textbook, so that he might convey his ideas and concepts of Jewish history without having to compete with better-trained non-Jewish colleagues.45 Beer first mentions his ambitious historiographie project in the in troduction: to write a modern history of the Jews from the beginnings up to his own times.46 Toldot Israel and Geschichte der Juden were then to be the first two volumes of a world-history.47 Notwithstanding, the two books' different approaches and outlooks Beer viewed them as part of a greater enterprise, which means that already by the first decade of the nineteenth century, he had planned to write the kind of comprehensive Jewish history the Wissenschaft scholar Isaak Markus</page><page sequence="10">356 LOUISE HECHT Jost would produce only about twenty years later. Instructively, many non-Jewish contemporaries judged Beer's historiographie enterprise fa vorably and encouraged him to persist.49 Wissenschaft scholars like Jost and Graetz condemned Beer's writings, which they called useless, while they berated Beer's lack of training and inability to observe the scholarly canons of Wissenschaft.50 Despite Beer's insistence that the two volumes be viewed together, the methodological and ideological shift between Toldot Israel and Geschichte der Juden is striking and shows Beer going beyond the lim its of maskilic historiography. A comparison of a passage that appears in both works (the period from Cyrus' rise to power to the end of the Second Temple period) is illustrative. Toldot Israel stresses that Divine Providence had ended the Babylonian exile and brought Cyrus to issue his decree allowing Jews to return to their homeland.51 Geschichte der Juden, simply reports "the facts," adding candidly that the majority of the people did not return to Eretz Israel: "They had gotten used to their homes in Babylon and were not inclined to trade the material happiness they enjoyed there for the uncertainty of Palestine."52 Beer's approach is entirely new. First, he has relinquished Provi dence as a motivating historical force, even if this left him with no explanation for why Cyrus allowed the Jews to return. Unlike in most maskilic historical writing, he granted events their autonomy, which also meant, most significantly, effectively renouncing Israel's theolog ical and historical mission. Second, the absence of such a mission is reflected in the fragmention of the Jews as a people; this is a leitmotiv in Geschichte der Juden. Toldot Israel presents the return to Jerusalem as a joint national venture. Geschichte der Juden admits to historical options. One part of the nation opted for national "rejuvenation," the others preferred the "luxury" of exilic life. Third, following the lead of Josephus, Beer depicts assimilation in positive terms - at least to the extent assimilation does not lead to polytheism or obvious violations of Jewish law. Having given up, it appears, on national redemption, the historical subject was now the individual Jew. Hence, Geschichte der Juden replaced the inwardly-turned narrative of Toldot Israel and substitutes, in its place, a new one that sought to interweave the thread of Jewish narrative with the historical fabric of the "nations." By doing precisely this, Beer created a genuine Jewish narrative, which announced - contrary to ages-old Christian theolog ically based claims - that even after the Second Temple period, the Jews did have an autonomous history. Yet the narrative was strongly influenced by his assimilationist Weltanschauung. For most Jewish his</page><page sequence="11">MODERN JEWISH HISTORIOGRAPHY 357 torians, the Bar Kokhba r?volt epitomizes national heroism.53 Beer portrayed it as the insanity of a fanatic that finally caused the depopu lation of Palestine, which he contrasted to an idealized life of "peaceful Jews" under Roman rule. In distinction to the prevailing historical view, he emphasized that up to the fifth century, Jews were equal to Roman citizens, enjoyed all civil rights, could occupy the highest positions in state-bureaucracy and in the army and, in addition, had their own religious leaders.54 With the destruction of the Temple, the political significance of Palestine for the history of the Jews faded, fi nally to end after the failure of the Bar Kokhba-revolt. The attachment to the country, the last factor that according to Beer's narrative united the Jews as a people, had ceased to exist. Precisely when the national history of the Jews came to an end, the history of Jewish individuals could begin. But Beer soon realized that such a secular, liberal narrative was not viable for a comprehensive Jewish history. Renouncing religious history and denying national features of the Jewish people would leave him without a common denominator for the history of the Diaspora. This common denominator he finally found in the notion of Judaism as a religious denomination, much as non-Jewish society was insist ing. For Beer, religion was the glue cementing divergent Jewish narra tives together, and, consequently, in his next major work, the so-called Sektengeschichte,55 Beer wrote not a history of the Jews, but one of Judaism. Whereas for Beer, Josephus embodied the model for cultural as similation, for another maskil he epitomized national heroism and the willingness to sacrifice himself for the sake of his people. Comparing Jeremiah and Josephus, both witnesses to the destruction of their respective Temples, Salomo L?wisohn claimed that those great men had sought to prevent the uprising of their people against an all powerful intruder out of patriotic commitment.56 L?wisohn, who tried to transform Josephus from the traitor he was so often viewed as into a national hero, was himself imbued with the spirit of 'romantic' Jewish nationalism. He was born in Mor, a town in Hungary, in 1789,57 where he received a traditional Jewish education, while he studied secular subjects in the town's monastery. In 1809, he came to Prague, where he continued his Jewish and general studies, befriended local maskilim, and, following this formative influence, started to publish on Hebrew language and poetry, as well as on historical topics. In 1815, he moved to Vienna and worked as a proofreader in the prestigious publishing</page><page sequence="12">358 LOUISE HECHT house of Anton Schmid, where he remained until his untimely death in 1821. L?wisohn dedicated the largest part of his work to Hebrew language and literature. However, even some of his Hebrew publications on lin guistics and biblical geography reveal genuine historic interest.58 His actual historical studies were written in German. In both languages, L?wisohn excelled in a vivid and poetic style. Like nearly all Prague maskilim, L?wisohn published a number of articles in the German jour nal Sulamith, the first in 1812.59 Continuing a maskilic tradition, the majority of these essays were short biographical sketches of Sephardic Jews60 like Ibn Ezra and Menasseh ben Israel,61 or of philosophers and grammarians, like Sa'adya Gaon and Elijah Levita.62 Even in those small sketches in which he embedded the biographies in historical con text, L?wisohn managed to convey his original view of Jewish history. His most remarkable piece, however, was a study about the history of North African Jews published in Sulamith in 1812.63 Justifying why he was drawn to such an exotic subject, L?wisohn summarized his concept of Jewish history as follows: [...] the scholar of Jewish history, who turns away from the smoking ruins of Jerusalem to pursue the destinies of her sons scattered all over the world, [... ] finds the chain's links harshly disintegrated, but in spite of the severe disintegration, they are firmly linked together to form one chain; he retrieves the exact picture, the same way of thinking, identical wishes, and hopes in the Israelite who lives at the far edge of blazing Africa as in his brother, [... ] who dwells on the strands of the Northern Sea. And when he seriously tries to understand this masterpiece of Providence, [... ] when he tries to figure the gradual development of the nation in its country - the universe - as a coherent process, he must primarily focus on places that hosted significant Jewish settlements even in ancient times and continue doing so even today.64 That is, even after the destruction of the Temple and the end of the Jewish state, the Jews constitute one nation with identical features, characteristics, and hopes. Since they excel in continuity and share a common nature, destiny, and goal, they may be the subject of a national historiography, and this is so despite their dispersion and lack of a com mon territory and state. L?wisohn's poetic description of the character and history of the Jewish people resonates with romantic concepts of the Volksgeist developed by Herder and Hegel.65 His ideas also resemble</page><page sequence="13">MODERN JEWISH HISTORIOGRAPHY 359 the conception of the German "cultural nation" (Kulturnation) current since the mid-eighteenth century, which effectively dissociate German nationalism from politics.66 In addition, his truly universal outlook - after the destruction of the Second Temple, the fatherland of the Jews encompasses the whole universe - matches current trends in English and German historiography.67 L?wisohn's views on the whole corre spond to those of the (pre-historicist) non-Jewish scholarship of his day,68 meaning that he diverges from a traditional Jewish outlook as much as from the usual maskilic agenda. The differences become even more obvious in the hundred-page long booklet published in 1820, an elaborate overview of Jewish history with the pretentious title Vorlesungen ?ber die neuere Geschichte der Juden.?9 The book, in fact, was a collection of the essays mentioned above that had already appeared in Sulamith (most of them without major changes70). To these essays, L?wisohn added seven new chap ters reflecting his particular interests. With two chapters on illustrious Marranos (chap. 10, 11) and biographies of Jewish sages at the court of Alfonso X (1252-1283, chap. 12), L?wisohn reflects the maskilic attraction to Sephardic Jewry. However, the otherwise wide range of his subjects again shows him going beyond normal maskilic concerns. The critical depiction of the Karaites (chap. 3), as well as his tribute to the learned traveling rabbis in the twelfth century (chap. 9), who, as opposed to former and later generations, were equally imbued with a thirst for knowledge and the "sacred love for their nation," firmly cuts against the grain of the maskilic agenda. The republished piece on the history of the Jews in North Africa (chap. 6) and a study on French Jewry from Roman times to the end of the Carolingian dynasty in the tenth century (chap. 2) are the only chapters of considerable scope. North African Jewry must have inspired L?wisohn because of its exotic flair. His interest in early French Jewry was no doubt a product of contemporary events in revolutionary France, especially Napoleon's convocation of the French Sanh?drin in 1807.71 As Reuben Michael rightly emphasized, L?wisohn's essays are pre sented in no chronological or logical order.72 Their concatenation seems merely coincidental, which Michael attributed to L?wisohn's unsys tematic approach. Yet, to me, the seeming chaotic structure reflects, instead, L?wisohn's ambivalence toward Jewish historiography. How ever confident he was that the study of Jewish history could contribute to one's general Bildung, L?wisohn considered the writing of a "formal, chronological history of the Jews" after the period covered by Josephus impossible because of a lack of sources.73 Yet, German historians, too,</page><page sequence="14">360 LOUISE HECHT at this time still doubted the feasibility of a German national history.74 On the other hand, L?wisohn defined the term ^neuere Geschichte" used in the book's title to identify his subject as the whole of Jewish history since the destruction of the Second Temple.75 He thus opposed the traditional Christian assertion that Jewish history ended in 70 C.E. and, like Beer, reclaimed the legitimacy of post-destruction Jewish history and its study. At the same time, though regarding formal histo riography as unfeasible, L?wisohn viewed his own work as preliminary "to reviving the dark and lifeless data" of Jewish history. He also seems to have been confident that readers would appreciate his efforts and, in this spirit, he promised to publish further volumes,76 a promise his untimely death in the following year prevented him from fulfilling. L?wisohn's only structured attempt to incorporate the discrete episodes of Jewish history into some kind of unified fabric consisted of an impressionistic eleven-page outline, which forms the Vorlesunger?s first chapter. Picking up the thread from Josephus, L?wisohn divided "the later history of the Jews" rather originally into six periods:77 The Bar Kokhbah revolt, the ascendance of Christianity and Islam (as offsprings of Judaism), the Crusades, the Expulsion from Spain, the rise of the Dutch Republic in the sixteenth century, and, finally, the "philosophic century" of Moses Mendelssohn and Emperor Joseph II. This periodization was informed by a "national Jewish narrative" which considered the unity and continuity of the Jewish people as fundamen tal. Since, according to L?wisohn's view, Jews were the only historical unit in existence with an unbroken continuity, Jewish history was vir tually synonymous with world history. Indeed, L?wisohn sought to credit the Jews for almost every major spiritual development possible, including not only monotheism, but also the Renaissance. Reversing the anti-Jewish polemic that Judaism was ossified and outdated by its successors, L?wisohn proclaimed the Jewish contribution to the progress of humanity. What is more, following his romantic inclination, L?wisohn regarded the ideas of progress and yearning for freedom, both of which he greatly cherished, as intrinsic Jewish traits.78 L?wisohn's writings evince little, if any, of the objective detachment, for which modern scholarship (imperfectly) strives. His descriptions of Jewish suffering are highly passionate. However, these sufferings were to be weighed against the Jewish people's spiritual achievements, as the numerous biographies of Jewish scholars found in Vorlesungen attest. Turning his back on contemporary discussions of "Jewish regenera tion," he deemed the Talmud, the invention of the bill of exchange, and Hebrew literature the Jewish people's main accomplishments.79</page><page sequence="15">MODERN JEWISH HISTORIOGRAPHY 361 L?wisohn's nationalistic inclinations may help explain why the later Jewish historian Heinrich Graetz's judged L?wisohn's work so favor ably.80 The Vorlesungen clearly demonstrate L?wisohn's original his torical insight. What he lacked were the tools (or, perhaps, the ad ditional years of life) to articulate a coherent national narrative that would integrate the discrete chapters of Jewish history. Marcus (Meir) Fischer is the only one of the three Prague mas kilim discussed here who has previously been regarded as an actual historian.81 Born in Vienna, in 1788, Fischer was an offspring of a rabbinic family originating from Prague. He received both a traditional, as well as a thorough secular education. About 1809, he moved from Vienna to Prague, where he became a clerk in the Bohemian Jewish tax administration. Fischer lived until 1858, but his many historical writings, both in Hebrew and German, stem from the early decades of the century. His first book, Qorot shnot qedem,82 published in 1812 with an approbation of the traditional rabbi Eleazer Fleckeles (1754 1826), is a Hebrew recapitulation of the mythological prehistory of the Roman Republic up to the fifth century B.C.E. according to Roman legends. Fischer dedicated further publications to post-biblical Jewish history. Like L?wisohn, he was especially attracted to the history of the Jews in North Africa,83 as well as to that of Marranos. Fischer was the first Jewish historian to exploit Uriel da Costa's autobiography.84 Like Beer and L?wisohn, Fischer published several articles in Sulamith,85 and like them, too, he planned to write a comprehensive history of the Jews. However, his ambitious plan failed for want of subscribers.86 Fischer viewed history as an independent subject, worthy of special scholarly interest. He considered it the duty of every nation to keep a record of its past that would serve as a source of national pride and identity, and he thought of himself as the reviver of what he considered long neglected Jewish historical writing. Like L?wisohn, he emphasized that the Jews did not stop being a nation after the destruction of the Temple. Nevertheless, detached from their native soil, their intellec tual powers faded, which shattered Jewish self-esteem and decreased emotional attachment to the nation.87 Fischer conceived Jewish life in exile as a chain of persecutions and expulsions, and this may explain his apologetic tone, especially in his German publications. In a short article, published in Sulamith in 1812, Fischer tried to demonstrate that whenever opportunity knocked, Jews excelled in all scholarly fields.88 This squares with his willingness to comply with the demands for Jewish regeneration as a pre-condition for emancipation.89 Yet, he did not flinch to portray Jews as brave</page><page sequence="16">362 LOUISE HECHT and noble-minded, drawn to agriculture and crafts, and imbued with a strong civic spirit. While L?wisohn revered the Arabs and their culture, Fischer chose a quote by Michaelis - "Die gr??ten und furchtbarsten Gegner Mahomeds und seiner Nachfolger waren die Juden [...]" (The Jews were the biggest and most frightening enemies of Mahomed and his successors) - as a motto for his book Toldot Yeshurun. His aim was to emphasize the common ground on which Judaism and Christianity faced Islam. Though well aware of the traditional tensions between Jews and non Jews, Fischer preferred to disregard conflict and, instead, to search out incidences of solidarity. Thus, reporting on the Jewish revolt against the Roman Emperor Trajan (98-117) in Cyrenaica, in 115 C.E., he claimed that the non-Jewish inhabitants enthusiastically supported the Jewish uprising. L?wisohn, when covering the same events, followed the classical source, the Roman History of Dio Cassius (68, 32), who considered the hostility of the local non-Jewish population to be the ultimate cause of the eventual Jewish defeat.90 Fischer's outlook on Jewish history was certainly less original than L?wisohn's. But he also did not allow imagination to fill in where classical sources left off. Yet there where times when he did resort to invention, and, in these cases, he did so without restraint. Lamenting, as did L?wisohn, the dearth of reliable sources for Jewish history in the post-biblical era,91 Fischer sought to resolve the problem through wholesale fabrication, and he forged a chronicle about the history of Bohemian Jewry from the thirteenth century to the middle of the eighteenth. Fischer claimed only "to have discovered" the so-called Ramshak-chromcle-, and from 1820 onwards, he placed fragments of his alleged German translation at the disposal of other historically-minded Bohemian maskilim like Peter Beer and Moses Wolf Jeitteles.92 Beer, the first one to use Fischer's forgery, cautiously quoted it as "an ancient Prague chronicle,"93 but only ten years later, it was being referred to as "annals, generally valued by Bohemian Jews."94 During the nineteenth century, it enjoyed an ever-rising prestige, testifying to the venerable history of Prague's Jewish community, its traditions, and rites. So great was this prestige, as well as the willingness to accept the chronicle's authenticity, that despite blatant inconsistencies, it took more than a hundred years for the forgery to be revealed. Yet Fischer was not the first at this time to strengthen the identity of his national reference-group by falsifying an ancient manuscript. That palm apparently goes to the Highland-Scots James und John Macpherson, who fabricated an ancient Scottish literary tradition in</page><page sequence="17">MODERN JEWISH HISTORIOGRAPHY 363 the 1760s. Medieval Czech manuscripts, too, were forged between 1816 and 1819, their authors being Fischer's Bohemian compatriots Vaclav Hanka (1791-1861) and Josef Linda (1789-1834), who were bent on demonstrating the cultural equality, or even superiority, of the politi cally oppressed Czechs.95 Similarly, Fischer sought to foster Bohemian Jewish identity through history. The construction of a coherent his tory dating to the thirteenth century certainly advanced Jewish self consciousness in the Bohemian lands. However, Fischer seems to have been pursuing an additional aim. Several pieces of the chronicle empha size the friendly relations between Jews and Czechs during the Hussite revolution. As early as 1800, the Hussites were being exploited by the Czech national movement as crucial in the emergence of a Czech na tional identity.96 Fischer's "chronicle" also claimed the existence of an independent Czech-Jewish community in Prague (alongside a German and a Sephardic one) in the Middle Ages. Fischer seems clearly to have been set on defusing the accusation made by some in the emerging Czech national movement that the Jews were a Germanizing element in Czech lands.97 Fischer was thus a forerunner of those Jewish intel lectuals who sought understanding between Czechs and Jews in the Vorraaerz-period.98 Despite appearances, rather than belying a scholarly approach to history, Fischer's forgery testifies to his deep historical concern: Like the Czechs, he believed that the legitimate right of a people for emanci pation had to be supported by historical evidence. Yet, contrary to the norm, Fischer's narrative did not develop as the saga of two competing national entities or of one entity oppressed by another. Rather, it rested on the touted solidarity of two disfranchised peoples and the hope for Jewish acculturation. As opposed to Beer's German-assimilationist and L?wisohn's Jewish-national narratives, Fischer opted for a Czech oriented retelling of Jewish history, stressing the ties that unite Czechs and Jews, as they struggled in common for emancipation. III. The solidarity or, rather, the parallel between the "national awakening" of Czechs and Jews in the Bohemian lands at the beginning of the nine teenth century forms the core of Ruth Kestenberg-Gladstein's theory about the national character of the Bohemian Haskalah movement.99 According to this eminent scholar of Czech-Jewish history, the mas kilim's "interest in history, and in particular in the history of their own nation," 10? was the best evidence of a rising "national consciousness"</page><page sequence="18">364 LOUISE HECHT among Bohemian Jews. Indeed, it seems plausible that the growing concern of Czech revivalists (obrozeni) for their own culture, language, and history, in distinction to the regnant German culture consider ably expanded the Jewish scope of action. Distinct from the essentially homogeneous culture of German lands, the multinational character of the Habsburg Empire, embracing, of course, that of the Czech lands, allowed for the formation of an independent cultural or even national Jewish identity, one expression of which might have been historical writing. However, similar national struggles in other parts of the Habsburg Empire did not give rise to Jewish historical writing, and, in the event, underlying Kestenberg-Gladstein's shortcut from "national conscious ness" to "interest in history" seems to be principally informed by her own Jewish-national concerns.101 More to the point, as has been demon strated above, the choice of a Jewish-national narrative by Bohemian maskilim when writing history was not one we should take for granted. In fact the option of an assimilationist narrative, oscillating between a German and Czech orientation, seems to have been more appealing. As an explanation for the emergence of Jewish historiography in Prague that complements that of Kestenberg-Gladstein I would propose that in Germany, Jewish enlightenment and emancipation were first discussed in philosophical terms and circles. Only after the emergence of roman ticism and German historicism, did this discussion move to the realm of history. That is, in the second half of the eighteenth century, German Jews adopted the regnant scholarly (i.e., philosophical) discourse as they critically revised their own tradition and cultural heritage. By contrast, there was hardly any public philosophical discussion of Jewish modernization, regeneration, or utility in the Habsburg Empire. Much as in Germany's Catholic regions, Enlightenment theory was subordi nated to political realities and events.102 Hence, the Toleranzpatent of Joseph II did not culminate a theoretical debate. It trigged it. This "state-imposed Enlightenment" forced Jews of all ideological camps to take stance on such crucial issues as communal autonomy, education, and military conscription. And as in the non-Jewish sector, Jewish re formers sought to promote their opinion through historical arguments. By drawing on historic texts, they aimed to prove that the proposed reforms did not gainsay tradition, but represented original practice.103 Opponents soon answered in kind, adopting historical discourse them selves to fight undesirable reforms. In this way, historical investigation was stimulated all the more.</page><page sequence="19">MODERN JEWISH HISTORIOGRAPHY 365 A precondition for fruitful historical discourse, however, or so I would venture, was a sufficiently large and heterogeneous Jewish community, harboring reforming, as well as conservative, elements to produce a variety of - historical - opinion. Prague's geographic position on the cross-road between East and West, its numerous and well-established Jewish community, its historical continuity, its reputation as a center of talmudic learning, as well as of Haskalah, turned it into the ideal breeding-ground for just such a discourse, which indeed emerged. Yet following the Hapsburg reforming paradigm of action preceding debate, Jewish history written in Prague was anchored in the pragmatic, as many of Beer's books and the contents of Fischer's forgery indicate. A significant part of the Ramshak-chromcle was bent on validating religious reforms or changes progressives were demanding, for example, the modification of burial rites, the lavish decoration of synagogues, or permission to eat rice on Passover.104 The writings of Prague maskilim neither touch philosophical issues nor do they conceptualize Jewish history theoretically, the same conceptualization which Schorsch has called essential for the development of modern Jewish scholarship. Accordingly, the scholars of the Wissenschaft des Judentums, who generously exploited the sources collected by the Prague maskilim, dismissed their writings, which, to their minds, did not conform to the strict criteria of German idealism and historicism, and which they viewed as amateurish exercises unworthy of further consideration. The result was that the Prague maskilim and their contribution to Jewish historiography were soon forgotten. Rather, as seen above, it was post Hegelian German scholarship that continued to set the standard for modern Jewish historical production, with pre- Wissenschaft forays into history considered second-rate at best. Here, I have tried to suggest a need for modifying this judgment. Jewish historical writing at Prague was pioneering, it invoked a re markable variety of methods and narrative, and its authors should not be classed simply as forerunners of Wissenschaft. Moreover, unlike the representatives of Wissenschaft, who limited themselves to a sin gle rigid method, Prague Jewish historians approached their material creatively, and their texts vibrate with intellectual freshness, many of whose insights the master narrative of Wissenschaft historiography later suppressed. In fact, it would not be out of place to suggest a similarity between the variety of methods and narratives the Prague maskilim employed and postmodern historiographical thinking. In turn, this similarity may help explain why, for some of us, these narratives</page><page sequence="20">366 LOUISE HECHT have retained their power and why they are capable of stimulating historical curiosity even today.

Contrary to Reuben Michael, who insists on objective detachment as a precon dition for modern scholarship and emphasizes L?wisohn's emotional involve ment with his subject (T?-iT? ,NT1D ,~IR1TT ,UD*1 ,TTI?m Jin"?), I consider personal involvement a distinctive feature of evolving national historiogra phy. Michael's further criticism that L?wisohn neither critically examined his sources nor made use of contemporary historical literature is more serious, al beit equally informed by his German historicist standards, whereas my point of reference is a more pluralistic pre-historicist scholarship of the late-eighteenth century. Since German historiography emerged in academic circles, the crit ical approach to sources was a more fundamental requirement than in other countries. A possible explanation for L?wisohn's disregard of contemporary historical literature might be the political focus of many of these writings; see Iggers, "The European Context of Eighteenth-Century German Enlightenment Historiography," 234-239. However, Michael agrees that L?wisohn produced a new type of historiography, even if he was not a "professional historian" (/LTPli T?-?T? ,?mn ,i?irr aid1?! ,-majrj). 69.

For the changes and how they were possibly motivated see Kestenberg-Glad stein, Neuere Geschichte der Juden in den b?hmischen L?ndern, 271, note 172. 71.

This becomes especially manifest in his description of the Bar Kokhbah revolt (ibid., 7) and the Jewish uprising against Trajan in the Cyrenaica (ibid., 57 59). The latter passage is, however, a softened version of his article published in Sulamith. There L?wisohn even claimed that the unbridled Jewish strive for freedom could have liberated the whole world from the Roman yoke, if the Jews had acted as a united and well coordinated nation; see L?wisohn, "?ber den Zustand der Juden in den L?ndern der Barbarei," Sulamith 4,1 (1812), 258. 79. L?wisohn, Vorlesungen, 14-17. 80. The doyen of Jewish historiography stated that L?wisohn succeeded to draw a fascinating picture of Jewish history and could have possibly achieved much in this field, had he not died an untimely death; see Graetz, Geschichte der Juden, vol. 11, 411. 81.

Fischer complained about the fact in an editorial of his Historisches Taschen buch, called "An das Publikum." During the late eighteenth and early nine teenth century, subscription was a widely used means to publish manuscripts, without depending on the mercy of publishers; see Paul Raabe, B?cherlust und Lesefreuden. Beitr?ge zur Geschichte des Buchwesens im 18. und fr?hen 19. Jahrhundert (Stuttgart, 1984). For special difficulties of Jewish writers, who wanted to publish their manuscripts, see Peter Beer, "Ueber Literatur der Israeliten in den k.k. Staaten, im letzten Decennio des 18. Jahrhunderts," Annalen der Literatur und Kunst in den ?sterreichischen Staaten 4, 1 (1805), April, 179-187; May, 218-224, June, 269-276. 87. Fischer, Historisches Taschenbuch, 12. 88.

Whereas Sor kin claims that Mendelssohn and other German maskilim were reluctant to make emancipation dependent upon regeneration, Bohemian mas kilim did not reject this connection; see David Sorkin, The Transformation of German Jewry 1780-1840 (New York/Oxford, 1987), 63-78. 90. 17-20 ATTl?P JlTtnil ,-|UPg; L?wisohn, Vorlesungen, 58. 91.

Kieval, Languages of Community: The Jewish Experience in the Czech Lands (Berkeley, 2000), 110-124. An ironic twist in the discussion about the "folk-lyric" of Ossian presents Herder's lucid but erroneous plea for the authenticity of the poetry; see Johann Gottfried Herder, "Auszug aus einem Briefwechsel ?ber O?ian und die Lieder alter V?lker," Von deutscher Art und Kunst (Stuttgart: Reclam, 1988), 7-62. Similarly, Goethe helped to popularize the Czech forgeries by translating several of Hanka's poems into German.</page><page sequence="27">MODERN JEWISH HISTORIOGRAPHY 373 96. For example by the works of Josef Dobrovsky (1753-1829) see Hugh LeCaine Agnew, Origins of the Czech National Renascence (Pittsburgh, 1993), 35-36, 112-113, 126. 97. A further evidence for this theory might be seen in Fischer's reverence for Michaelis. The latter stimulated the esteem for the Czech language as well as the academic foundation of Slavic studies by suggesting the venerable age of a Slavic Bible translation; see Anna M. Drabek, "Der Nationsbegriff in B?hmen an der Grenze von Aufkl?rung und 'nationaler Wiedergeburt'," in Moritz Cs?ky and Reinhard Hagelkrys, eds., Vaterlandsliebe und Gesamtstaatsidee im Osterreichischen 18.
