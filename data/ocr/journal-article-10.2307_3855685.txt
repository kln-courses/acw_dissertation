Architec- turally the tomb is interesting because it possesses the only surviving example at Thebes of a stone pylon at the entrance to the forecourt. This pylon gives the tomb, externally, an imposing appearance which is greatly enhanced by its lofty situation on the hillside. Similar stone pylons, as Seele suggests, undoubtedly occurred in other Theban tombs of the greater nobles. The tomb also possessed a tall brick pyramid, only the lower courses of which now survive. A representation of this pyramid occurs in one of the better-preserved scenes in the Broad Hall. In the section devoted to Tjanefer and his family Seele discusses in the first place the true status of the deceased and concludes that he probably was ultimately First Prophet of Amun, although he is given the title explicitly only once in the tomb. He is otherwise called Third Prophet of Amun or ej ed . Seele suggests that the stroke in the latter title may represent tpy. This suggestion seems sound, whether the stroke be taken as a variant writing of or as a cardinal number used with ordinal sense. There are other good reasons, given by Seele, to confirm that Tjanefer was First Prophet of Amun, not least among them being the size, position, and quality of his tomb. In an interesting discussion of the relations of Tjanefer and their interconnexions with the high-priestly families of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties, Seele concludes that Tjanefer probably flourished in the period from the later years of Ramesses II to the earlier part of the reign of Ramesses III. He was certainly a member of the priestly clan that did so much to weaken royal authority in the late New Kingdom, but in view of the difficulty Seele has in establishing precisely that Tjanefer was High Priest and the exact period when he exercised that office, we should be cautious about agreeing with h it is final paragraph:'Perhaps it is not too much to say that Tjanefer contributed as much as any single individual to undermining the pharaonic authority and eventually, in consequence, to the collapse of the Ramessids, from which Egypt never fully recovered'. T. G. H. JAMES Earliest Intellectual Man's Idea of the Cosmos. By SAMUEL A. B. MERCER, London, 1957. Pp. iV+ 122. 25S. Professor Mercer here discusses ideas current in ancient Egypt and Sumero-Babylonia (a term defended by him in his preface) about the cosmos. After an introductory chapter he deals with the 'background' and proceeds to discuss-I quote some of the headings-the gods; kings and men; the sky, the earth, water, air, trees, plants, and grain; astronomy; creation; death and the future world; the underworld; and the cosmos. His last chapter deals with calendars and general comparisons. Each exposition is divided between the two regions, but the sections dealing with Sumero-Babylonian matters are noticeably shorter; this, we are told, is 'because the same thing is often true of both Egypt and Sumero-Babylonia'. Professor Mercer states that he has 'used a minimum of references in the text, trying to make up for it by a comparatively full bibliography at the end of the book'. This makes a reviewer's task difficult, for there are many statements which appear to be questionable. For instance, in a discussion of what the Egyptians believed the shape of the e earth to be, it is said (p. 77; cf. 64 f.) that 'the earth to the Egyptians was a disk, personified, and represented as an outstretched man'. The latter part of this statement clearly refers to the familiar depiction of Geb, as in Bonnet, Bilderatlas: Agyptische Religion, fig. 2. One should, therefore, say 'god' rather than 'man', even though the figure is anthropomorphic. But what is the evidence that Geb here personifies and represents the earth as a disk? If the statement intends to relate the participles to 'earth' rather than 'disk', the question remains whether the Egyptians ever thought of the earth as a disk. None of the relevant hieroglyphs appears to suggest this. It is true that a common expression in Egyptian for the earth (which Mercer does not refer to) is snnt itn, 'what the sun goes round'; cf. snnt nbt itn 'all that the sun goes round'.' The most frequent writing, however, of this verb according to the Worterbuch is Q , where the determinative is oval rather than circular. Further, even if the action involved the describing of a circle, it would not follow that the object encircled was regarded as of that shape; it is possible, for example, to encircle a square. The Egyptians may, of course, have imagined the movement of the sun round the earth to be in a course above and below a flat object, in a two-dimensional pattern. If so, the shape of I For the two expressions see Wb. Iv, 490.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 123 the flat object, i.e. the earth, remains equally unclarified. In a well-known instance' Osiris is shown making a circle round the underworld (d;t), and his action is denoted in writing by the verb sni. Does this imply that the shape of the underworld was regarded as circular? I think not, for there is no suggestion of that elsewhere. Sethe in his Altdgyptische Vorstellungen vom Laufder Sonne (Sitzungsb., Berlin, 1928), 3 finds in P.Harris, 44, 4-5 an idea of the earth floating 'als eine Scheibe'2 on the waters of Nun. The relevant expression con- cerns the action of Ptah, who is said to have 'surrounded (phr) it (the earth) with Nun (and) the sea'. Whether phr here can be pressed to give this picture of the shape of the earth is extremely doubtful. On this as on other matters Mercer does not claim to present detailed evidence; and if he possesses it, the reader will be piqued to have to go without it. When it is stated (on p. 64) that 'as the ancients regarded the earth on which they lived, it looked round and flat but not a globe', the assumption seems reasonable since the contour of the horizon suggests roundness. Yet when the Egyptians represented the horizon, or parts of it, in hieroglyphs, they did not suggest this contour at all; for some reason it was only sections of a hilly or mountainous horizon that were selected for depiction in hieroglyphic form.3 J. GWYN GRIFFITHS An Ancient Egyptian Book of Hours. By RAYMOND O. FAULKNER, printed for the Griffith Institute by the University Press, Oxford, 1958. Pp. xi+41+60*. I plate. 2is. MIr. Faulkner here publishes with an introduction, translation, commentary, and transcription, the Ptolemaic religious text which he described in this Journal, 40 (I954), 34-39. The papyrus was presented by Sir Alan Gardiner to the British Museum where it bears the number 10569. The manuscript is tentatively dated to the third century B.C., and the internal evidence is said to point to a northern and probably a Memphite origin. Mr. Faulkner's presentation of the text shows his customary care and calligraphy. He believes that the title can be restored as 'To Osiris in all his names'. There are invocations to many deities in the text and it is suggested that 'all the multitudinous beings and objects invoked were regarded simply as manifestations of Osiris, in whom all divinity was deemed to be concentrated'. The most striking example of such an idea might be the allusion in i6, 3, if the restoration is right, to 'Osiris in [all his] names of Ptah', following several designations of Ptah. It is noticeable, however, that in the other cases where the expression 'Osiris in all his names' occurs, the context deals specifically with names of Osiris; see 6, 26; 13, 7; I5, I9. An expression like 'Osiris in the towns and nomes where his ka desires to be' (8, 24) might suggest that all the places mentioned are claimed for this god; but we find also 'Geb in every place where his ka desires to be' (20, 22), and the same words are used of Nephthys, Thoth, Anubis, Isis, Nut, and Horus. After one long list of gods and goddesses in various places, the invocation is closed with 'the [gods] and goddesses in whose places Osiris rests' (0o, 14). (Faulkner, p. 7, translates 'who accommodate Osiris in their places', taking it literally (n. on p. 30) as 'who make content'; but htp may well be singular and intransitive here, for its causative sense is not common, see Wb. IIi, I92. For the frequent use of htp with m of the seats of deities and cult-objects see Wb. III, 190.) Faulkner aptly suggests (p. 30) that the allusion is here 'to those deities who included a shrine to Osiris in their sacred precincts'. Such a gesture would point to the predominance of Osiris, but does not necessarily imply a process of Osirian pansyncretism. When fusion of gods is expressly indicated, as in the names Ptah-Sokar (3, 29; 6, 14; 15, 22), Osiris-Sepa (4, I; 6, 20), Osiris-Sokar (4, 3; 4, 7), Sokar-Osiris (7, 6), Osiris-Horus4 (8, 2), Osiris-Atum (8, 22), Apis- Atum-Horus (io, i6), Ptah-Osiris (I5, 24), Nut-Ope (19, 7), Nut-Rere (19, 8), Thoth-Atum (21, 22), I Bonnet, Bilderatlas, fig. I9; cf. R. T. Rundle Clark, Myth and Symbol in Ancient Egypt, pl. 14 and p. 249. 2 Cf. John A. Wilson in Before Philosophy (Pelican, 1949), 54, 'a flat platter with a corrugated rim'. 3 See Gardiner, Eg. Gramm., Sign-list, N 25-28. Sethe, op. cit. 9, n. i points out that 'horizon' is only a makeshift translation of iht. 'Hilly horizon of sunrise' (or, sometimes, 'of sunset') would be cumbersome, while 'Sonnenberg' excludes the sky element. 4 This should perhaps be read 'Osiris-Sepa', taking the falcon with outstretched wings as a substitute for the flying pintail duck which is normal in the writing of Sepa although it is not used, admittedly, in the other writings found in this text (4, i; 6, 20; 7, 7). At any rate Horus is not thus written in this text in any of the numerous instances.</page></plain_text>
