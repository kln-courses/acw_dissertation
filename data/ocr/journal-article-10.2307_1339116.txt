<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME 78 JANUARY 1965 NUMBER 3 L HARVARD LAW REVIEWV THE STOCKHOLDER'S RIGHT TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE SALE OF SHARES William D. Andrews * The classic case imposing liability for a sale of controlling shares of stock at a price not offered to other stockholders is Perlman v. Feld- mann. Professor Andrews, after examining other possible rationales for that case, proposes that whenever a controlling block of shares is sold, minority stockholders should be given an equal opportunity to sell on the same terms. He then analyzes the practical, economic, and theoretical bases for this rule, recognizes its qualifications, and discusses its bearing on certain related issues of corporate ownership. A STOCKHOLDER is ordinarily free to hold or sell his shares solely according to the dictates of his own interests as he conceives them. Further, he is free to determine for himself the price at which he will sell, and below which he will not. It follows, according to some, that a controlling stockholder can sell his shares at any price he is offered, whether or not the offer is made to other stockholders. There are only two qualifications: (i) the stockholder may not receive anything as consideration for the sale of control itself, apart from the stock, as when part of the consideration paid is identified as compensation for his resigna- tion as an officer or director or his participation in the election of successors nominated by the purchaser; 1 (2) the controlling stockholder must not act in such a way as deliberately or negli- gently to harm his corporation, as, for example, by delivering it into the hands of thieves,2 or, perhaps, by depriving it of a favor- able opportunity for corporate action.3 The scope of these quali- fications is uncertain; indeed, they may embrace the field if one * Assistant Professor of Law, Harvard Law School.

The problem can be approached by calling in question the gen- eral proposition that a stockholder is free to sell at a price not offered generally. I agree that a stockholder should be free to decide to sell or hold according to his own measure of his own interests. I agree further that he should be wholly free to deter- mine for himself the price at which he will sell, and below which he will hold his shares. But it does not follow that a controlling stockholder (or any other stockholder) is free to sell on terms not generally available to other stockholders. A stockholder can be given complete freedom of choice in deciding to sell or hold, and in fixing his price, but still be required to exercise that freedom within the realm of a market where all stockholders are guaran- teed an equal opportunity. Indeed, frequently the vitality of a free market, and the purposes that it serves, are enhanced rather than impaired by the prescription of minimal rules within which the participants must make and implement their choices. I propose to consider the sale-of-control problem from the point of view of the proposition that a controlling stockholder should not be free to sell, at least to an outsider, except pursuant to a purchase offer made equally available to other stockholders; or, put in the affirmative, that one of the rights of the minority stockholders I is to have an equal opportunity with all other stockholders to participate ratably in any sale of shares pursuant to a favorable offer for the purchase of controlling shares in their corporation.

Feldmann was president and chairman of the board of Newport Steel Corporation. He and members of his family, friends and associates owned 37 per cent of the outstand- ing stock. The rest was widely held and regularly traded over the counter. During the Korean emergency steel was in short supply, but reputable producers exercised restraint in raising their prices. In this situation Feldmann arranged for the sale of his and his associates' stock to Wilport Company, a syndicate of steel users organized to acquire control of a dependable source of supply. The price was $20 per share, almost twice the market price which never exceeded $I2, and more than the book value of $I7.03. Feldmann and his colleagues resigned as directors of Newport and elected Wilport's nominees. Thereafter Newport made sales of steel to Wilport's constituent companies at prevailing market prices. Perlman, a stockholder of Newport, brought a derivative suit against Feldmann and other selling stockholders, arguing that the power to control allocation of Newport's product was a corporate asset, and that part of the price the Feldmann group received for its stock was in reality a payment for conferring that power on Wilport.7 The suit was to recover that part of the price on behalf of the corporation, although to prevent Wilport from recovering part of its purchase price the plaintiffs suggested that the recovery be limited to 63 per cent of the control premium and be made payable directly to the outside stockholders rather than to the cor- poration. The district court held for the defendants, reasoning that con- trol, including the power over allocation of the corporate product, is not a corporate asset but "an additional factor of value attach- ing to the control block, which enures to the benefit of its owner and may be realized by him on its sale." 8 Furthermore, no harm to Newport was shown to be likely or to have happened, and the price, while high, was not unfair. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, held for the plaintiffs, and remanded the case for a determination of the value of the Feldmann stock "without the appurtenant control over the corporation's output of steel." 9 Two years later the district court determined the appropriate value to be $I4.67 7f 2I9 F.2d at I75. 8 I29 F.

He stated the plaintiff's argument that power to allocate steel was a corporate asset, but did not say he accepted it. Rather he stated in general terms, citing Indiana cases, that the controlling share- holders "stood in a fiduciary relationship to the corporation and to the minority stockholders as beneficiaries thereof." 11 That, he said, puts the burden on them to prove that there was no possi- bility of harm to the corporation from their sale of stock. This they cannot do, because there are ways in which Newport could have realized on the high demand for steel, even without raising prices. In the first place Newport could have used its position to demand advance payment from a customer before firmly accepting an order. Feldmann had had the corporation do this before, and other reputable producers had followed suit; indeed this form of financing improvements had become known in the industry as the Feldmann Plan. In the second place Newport could have utilized the market situation to cultivate patronage in the immediate area of its production facilities, where alone it could compete profitably when steel was more abundant. But the opinion ends with the suggestion that liability rests on the fact that the premium was, in the circumstances, a premium for the corporate product: "in a time of market shortage, where a call on a corporation's product commands an unusually large premium, in one form or another, we think it sound law that a fiduciary may not appropriate to himself the value of this premium." 12 Judge Swan dissented, asserting that control was an inseparable incident of the stock sold, for which the sellers were entitled to compensation unless there was a more concrete showing of harm to the corporation. In his opinion Feldmann was not "under any fiduciary duty as a stockholder not to sell the stock he con- trolled." 13 There are several interrelated theories on which Feldmann's liability can be predicated. 10 I54 F.

The Analogy of the Looting Cases The looting cases have most often involved investment com- panies. A purchaser buys a controlling block of stock at a pre- mium over value, whether that be taken as market value of the investment company's shares or the net asset value of its port- folio securities. As a condition of closing, the seller is to cause the purchaser and his nominees to be elected directors and officers. Then the purchaser utilizes his new place of power to steal from the corporation, selling portfolio securities and converting the proceeds to his personal use. The sellers have been held liable to the corporation for the amount of the premium and for the amount of the loss to the corporation, on a finding that circumstances were such as to put the seller on notice of the possibility of the looting that in fact occurred.14 Feldmann is said to fall in the same mold, except that the harm to the corporation, instead of the loss of cash and negotiable securities, is the loss of opportuni- ties for Feldmann Plan financing and generation of local pa- tronage.15 But there is a vast difference between the corporate losses in Feldmann and in the looting cases. The loss in the looting cases is one for which the purchaser, that is, the thief, would be held primarily liable if he were amenable to process and solvent enough to pay. The selling stockholder's liability for the loss is secondary, for facilitating, with notice, the purchaser's wrong- doing. There is nothing in Feldmann to suggest, however, that anything Wilport did or was likely to do after acquiring Feld- mann's stock was actionable.16 It is a nice question whether 14 Bosworth v.

I29 F. Supp. at I76.</page><page sequence="6">5IO HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 Wilport incurred any liability on account of the purchase itself, for paying the control premium to Feldmann instead of to the corporation or to all its stockholders pro rata; but if it did, that liability was secondary, for participating in Feldmann's wrong, not the primary liability of a looter for misconduct after the trans- fer of control is consummated. There is no reason why suit could not have been brought against Wilport if its acts of mismanage- ment were the gravamen of the plaintiffs' complaint. Putting aside the question of the purchaser's liability, there is a real question whether the sale of Feldmann's stock harmed the corporation at all by depriving it of any valuable opportunity. With respect to Feldmann Plan advances, the opinion seems to say that they could have been useful to Newport to supply funds to acquire needed additional facilities. If what is meant is simply that funds, however raised, could have been put to good economic use, it is hard to believe that Feldmann's sale of stock to Newport foreclosed the possibility of raising the funds. Customers ought to be more, not less, willing to advance funds for plant improve- ment, if they are also stockholders of the supplier corporation. If, as is perhaps more likely, it is just the interest-free character of the advances that should be regarded as adding a few points to the price of steel, then there is no showing that sale of the Feld- mann stock deprived Newport of the opportunity. If it were sufficiently common to require advance payment, then that would in effect be a term of the prevailing price which Wilport would be under a duty to pay in dealing with its new subsidiary."7 The matter of generating local patronage is even more prob- lematic. Here it is perfectly clear that Wilport's whole purpose in acquiring the Feldmann stock would have the effect of reducing Newport's sales to other customers. But there seems to have been no proof of the value of customer goodwill in steel, or whether it could be generated by sales in a period of short supply, or whether sales to local customers could reasonably be expected to produce business during future periods. And even if it could, the court gave no consideration to the offsetting possibility that ownership of a substantial block Qf its stock by a syndicate of steel users would provide surer customers in times of full supply. It is perfectly clear that under some circumstances stock owner- 17 Cf. I29 F. Supp. at I87.</page><page sequence="7">1965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 5II ship by a large customer can produce large profits for a firm in an industry with excess capacity.18 The court sought to avoid these difficulties by putting the burden of proof on Feldmann to show that harm to the corporation would not result from the sale of his stock. But calling it burden of proof will not hide the fact that liability predicated on the possibilities of corporate harm discussed in the court's opinion represents a substantial extension of the theory of the looting cases. Indeed, if the court's opinion on burden of proof is taken literally the operative effect is virtually to eliminate the need for any showing of either the likelihood or occurrence of harm to the corporation. Paradoxically, the strain on burden of proof might have been somewhat relieved by considering other possibilities of harm, not developed in the court's opinion. The most obvious possibility of harm was through the loss of an opportunity to capitalize on the market situation by a corporate sale of assets. If a syndicate of customers was willing to pay twice the going market price for 37 per cent of Newport's stock, it very likely would have been willing to pay something more than market for a larger per- centage, or all, of Newport's stock or assets; and sale of a corpo- ration's assets at a price significantly higher than the aggregate market value of its stock is at least presumptively an advan- tageous transaction. Indeed there was evidence that Feldmann had himself been negotiating, shortly before the sale of his stock, for a merger, which would, of course, have produced a prorata realization of proceeds for all of Newport's stockholders.19 Apparently no evidence was introduced in Perlman v. Feldmann to show whether a sale of assets would have been possible or desirable. But that should not prevent consideration of this 18 Feldmann so testified, and the district court found his testimony "highly plausible." Id. at I71, i86. See also Lebold v. Inland Steel Co., I36 F.2d 876 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 320 U.S. 787 (i943). In point of fact Wilport disposed of its Newport stock in I954, exchanging it for stock of Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Cor- poration. The exchange offer was made to all Newport stockholders and resulted in acquisition by Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott of 94.7% of Newport's stock. The exchange ratio was one share for 2.I with Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott selling around $22, thereby yielding Newport stockholders about $Io.5o per share.

Even without evi- dence the possibility of loss of an opportunity to sell assets or to merge is more substantial, and of greater magnitude to justify the recovery awarded, than the possibilities of harm discussed in the court's opinion. C. The Corporate Asset Theory Another interpretation of Feldmann would continue nominally to predicate liability on corporate injury, but would eliminate the need for separate proof as to the occurrence or likelihood of harm in any particular case by treating the transfer of controlling stock at a premium as being itself an injury to the corporation. This theory asserts that powers over corporate affairs are only to be exercised for the benefit of the corporation, and that it is there- fore a breach of fiduciary duty to the corporation if such powers are used or sold for private profit. The measure of recovery is the fiduciary's profit, or whatever he receives upon a sale of con- trol over and above the investment value of his shares. One way of stating this line of reasoning is to say that powers over corpo- rate affairs are powers in trust for the corporation. A convenient way to state the result is simply to assert that the power going with control is itself a corporate asset.20 The plaintiffs' theory in Feldmann echoes this line of argument, defining the corporate asset as the power to allocate steel, rather than control generally.2' 20 BERLE &amp; M1EANS, THE ,MODERN CORPORATION AND PRIVATE PROPERTY 243-44 (I932). 21 The district court concluded that the plaintiffs' argument hinged on the proposition that control was a corporate asset, and accordingly grounded its de- cision on the contrary position, that control powers are a "factor of value attach- ing to the control block, which enures to the benefit of its owner . . . ." I29 F. Supp. at i85. Other cases denying relief against sellers of controlling shares have used similar language. E.g., Tryon v. Smith, I9I Ore. I72, i8o, 229 P.2d 25I, 254 (I95i). See Jennings, supra note I5, at 23-26, 3i-38. In their brief on appeal the plaintiffs did not emphasize the corporate asset phraseology, but argued that Feld- mann must account for personal profits from "use of or traffic in the corporate powers, regardless of transfer of assets or injury to the corporation." Brief for Appellants, p. 34. Nevertheless, the court of appeals stated plaintiffs' position to be that power over the allocation of steel was a corporate asset; and plaintiffs' princi- pal argument was that the portion of Feldmann's sale price representing payment for that power inures to the corporation without separate proof of harm or loss of opportunity. Some writers have suggested that the holding in Feldmann may pro- vide authority for the doctrinal position that control is a corporate asset. Bayne, A Philosophy of Corporate Control, II2 U. PA. L. REV. 22, 50 (I963); Berle, supra</page><page sequence="9">I965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 513 There are, however, operative difficulties with the corporate asset theory. What happens, for example, after a corporation has received payment for the control acquired by a purchaser of its stock? Was Wilport free, after Feldmann accounted to his fellow stockholders, to resell the control stock at a premium? 22 Surely if control is initially a corporate asset in any accepted sense, it must now belong to Wilport who bought and paid for it. But then how does one know that control did not belong to Feld- mann rather than Newport before the sale to Wilport? Is it not likely that Feldmann has paid, one way or another, for his posi- tion of control? 23 This difficulty is largely implicit in the form of relief granted in Feldmann, whatever the theory on which it is predicated, since that relief involved paying the plaintiff stockholders for something without their selling their shares. The relief, in other words, creates two classes of stockholders: those (Perlman et al.) who have received payment for their control rights, and those (Wil- port) who have made payment. But the form of relief in Feld- mann was itself derived from the plaintiffs' variation of the cor- porate asset theory. Therefore the defect in the remedy, as well as the difficulty of knowing whether the control asset has passed in some other way from the corporation to the holder of con- trolling shares, can properly be attributed to the corporate asset theory.24 D. The Theory of Disguised Premium for the Corporate Product The opinion in Feldmann suggests another basis for liability, apart from any question of actual or imputed harm to the corpora- tion. The suggestion is contained in the declaration quoted above that "where a call on a corporation's product commands an un- note 15, at 122I; Jennings, supra note :5, at ii. The corporate asset theory has been advanced (citing Feldmann) and rejected in cases permitting voting stock to receive more than otherwise identical nonvoting stock in a recapitalization. See PP. 557-58 infra. 22 In fact, when Wilport sold, other stockholders were offered an opportunity to sell at the same price. See note i8 supra. But in effect that may have represented a premium sale by Wilport after all, since all shares except those sold by Wilport carried the right, ultimately, to share in the recovery against Feldmann. I54 F. Supp. at 446. 23 See pp. 534-36 infra. 24 See PP. 55o-56 infra.</page><page sequence="10">5I4 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:5o5 usually large premium, in one form or another, . . . a fiduciary may not appropriate to himself the value of this premium." 25 The premium Feldmann received for his stock was clearly, in the peculiar circumstances of the case, a form of payment of a higher price for steel. The court accepted, arguendo, Feldmann's argument that Newport could not ethically realize on the market situation through higher prices. But it does not follow that Feld- mann, a fiduciary for the corporation by all views, is then free to appropriate for himself the whole value of the premium a pur- chaser is willing to pay; "it ill becomes the defendants to disparage as unethical the market advantages from which they themselves reaped rich benefits." 26 All this suggests that the decision in Feldmann rests on the peculiarities of a market situation in which users were unable effectively to reflect their demand by bidding up the price of steel itself, but were able to reflect the same pres- sures in a bid for stock of a steel company.27 It seems to me that this is the soundest explanation of the rationale of Feldmann, and that the court's judgment is very deeply, and properly, influenced by the feeling that stockholders should share equally in the enjoyment of any profit resulting from a high demand for their corporation's product, whether or not the controlling stockholders' appropriation of the premium causes harm to the corporation in any traditional sense.28 But it is not clear to me that this explanation of the rationale of Feldmann does much to limit its applicability. Is a disguised premium for the corporate product basically different from a disguised pre- mium for the opportunity to be elected president, or to dispense patronage, or to become a supplier (instead of a customer) of the acquired corporation, or to deal with the corporation in any other capacity except that of stockholder as such? And to what extent is it possible to infer that any premium paid for a controlling 25 2I9 F.2d at I78. 26 Ibid. 27 See Manning, The Shareholder's Appraisal Remedy: An Essay for Frank Coker, 72 YALE L.J. 223, 225 (i962). But cf. Comment, supra note I5, at 732-33. 28Read literally, the opinion seems to make this an alternative to corporate harm as a ground for decision. Another possibility is that the two grounds are cumulative, so that the effect of Feldmann's receipt of a disguised premium for the corporate product is to shift the burden of proof to him on the issue of likelihood of resulting harm to the corporation. This interpretation might explain the ap- parent inconsistency with the looting cases on the question of burden of proof.</page><page sequence="11">I965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 5I5 block of shares is in reality a disguised premium for some oppor- tunity of this kind? E. The Stockholder's Right to Equal Opportunity in the Sale of Shares These questions suggest the possibility that Feldmann's lia- bility can be predicated simply on the fact that he sold at a price not offered or otherwise available to his fellow stockholders. The right violated, then, is simply the right of all stockholders to have an equal opportunity to participate ratably in a sale of stock pursuant to an offer to purchase controlling shares at a favorable price. Clearly enough, neither the plaintiffs' argument nor the court's opinion espouses this theory; and it has not been widely advanced elsewhere.29 However the form, if not the measure, of the relief granted in Feldmann - an accounting directly to non- participating stockholders - is consistent with this theory. And this theory would provide a basis for simplifying some of the problems presented under other interpretations of Feldmann, since it does not depend either on an assessment of the likelihood of corporate harm or on an appraisal of the value of control as such, or on the complementary notion of the investment value of shares shorn of the power of control. II. THE STOCKHOLDER'S RIGHT TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE SALE OF SHARES The rule to be considered can be stated thus: whenever a con- trolling stockholder sells his shares, every other holder of shares (of the same class) is entitled to have an equal opportunity to sell his shares, or a prorata part of them, on substantially the same terms. Or in terms of the correlative duty: before a con- trolling stockholder may sell his shares to an outsider he must assure his fellow stockholders an equal opportunity to sell their shares, or as high a proportion of theirs as he ultimately sells of 29 Jennings, supra note I5, at I, 29, suggests that liability might run directly to other stockholders, that it might arise from a sale of controlling shares without more, and that the seller's duty might be to arrange an opportunity for other stock- holders to sell on the same terms. But apparently the liability he suggests would still depend on proof that the sale price exceeded the investment value of the shares sold. Leech, supra note I5, at 8I5-I7, arrives by a different route at the con- clusion that a controlling stockholder's only safe course may be to arrange to have other stockholders offered an opportunity to sell on the same terms as he does.</page><page sequence="12">516 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 his own. There are qualifications in the application of the rule, to which I will return; 30 but for purposes of argument we can begin with this broad statement of it. Now let us look briefly at what the rule means. First, it neither compels nor prohibits a sale of stock at any particular price; it leaves a controlling stockholder wholly free to decide for himself the price above which he will sell and below which he will hold his shares. The rule only says that in executing his decision to sell, a controlling stockholder cannot sell pursuant to a purchase offer more favorable than any available to other stockholders. Second, the rule does not compel a prospective purchaser to make an open offer for all shares on the same terms. He can offer to purchase shares on the condition that he gets a certain proportion of the total. Or he can even make an offer to purchase 5I per cent of the shares, no more and no less. The only requirement is that his offer, whatever it may be, be made equally or proportionately available to all stockholders. Obviously if a purchaser offers to buy only 5I per cent of the shares, and the offer must be made equally available to all stockholders, no stockholder accepting the offer can count on selling all his shares. There are established mechanics for deal- ing with this situation. The purchaser makes a so-called tender offer, indicating the price at which he wants to buy and how many shares, and inviting all stockholders to tender their stock if they wish to sell at that price. If more shares are tendered than the purchaser is willing to take, then he purchases pro rata from each tendering stockholder. The device of a tender offer has been widely used when a purchaser wants to buy from the public; indeed the New York Stock Exchange Company Manual contains provisions dealing with tender offers, designed to ensure that such offers are made equally accessible to all stockholders.3' The asserted right would prevent just what happened in Feldmann: a private sale by a controlling stockholder at a price not available to other stockholders. But there are two modes of compliance with the rule: either the purchaser can extend his offer to all stockholders, or the seller can offer participation in the sale to his fellow stockholders. A sale is prevented from taking place only when the purchaser is unwilling to buy more than a specified percentage of the shares, and the seller will sell 30 See PP. 545-50 infra. 31 Nw YoRK STOCK EXCHANGE CoMPANY MANUAL at A-I79 (i 963).</page><page sequence="13">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 5I7 only if he can sell out completely. Indeed, even under these cir- cumstances it is an overstatement to say the rule would prevent a sale taking place, since the minority stockholders may consent to the sale. They may even sell to the purchaser at a lower price than what he pays the controlling stockholder, provided they are adequately informed of what is going on.32 Thus the rule only operates to prevent a sale when (i) the purchaser is unwilling to purchase more shares, (2) the seller insists on disposing of all his shares, and (3) the minority stockholders are unwilling to stay in the enterprise under the purchaser's control. A. Arguments I find it most useful to consider the arguments for and against the rule of equal opportunity successively from three viewpoints: the practical, the economic, and the theoretical. i. Practical Reasons. - (a). - There is a substantial danger that following a transfer of controlling shares corporate affairs may be conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the stockholders who have not had an opportunity to sell their shares. The corporation may be looted; it may just be badly run. Or the sale of controlling shares may operate to destroy a favorable opportunity for corporate action. Recent events con- firm that gross mismanagement may follow a sale of controlling shares.33 The equal opportunity rule does not deal directly with the prob- lem of mismanagement, which may occur even after a transfer of control complying with the rule; but enforcement of the rule will remove much of the incentive a purchaser can offer a con- trolling stockholder to sell on profitable terms. Indeed, in the case of a purchasing looter there is nothing in it for the purchaser unless he can buy less than all the shares; there is no profit in stealing from a solvent corporation if the thief owns all the stock.34 But the controlling stockholder will be loath to sell only part of his shares (except at a price that compensates him for all of his shares) if he expects the purchaser to destroy the value of what he keeps. The rule forces the controlling stock- holder to share equally with his fellow stockholders both the 32 See pp. 558-6i infra. 33 Barrons, Oct. 5, i964, p. 3; cf. Essex Universal Corp. v. Yates, 305 F.2d 572, 58i (2d Cir. i962) (Friendly, J., concurring). 34 Hill, supra note 15, at ggi.</page><page sequence="14">5I8 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 benefits of the price he receives for the shares he sells and the business risks incident to the shares he retains. This will tend strongly to discourage a sale of controlling shares when the risk of looting, or other harm to the corporation, is apparent; and it will provide the seller with a direct incentive to investigate and evaluate with care when the risks are not apparent, since his own financial interest continues to be at stake. Much of the significance of the rule of equal opportunity, how- ever, is that it does not depend upon proof of harm to the corpora- tion. If harm occurs, the rule eliminates the issue of whether the seller could reasonably have foreseen it. But the rule goes further by eliminating the occurrence of harm as a condition of liability. It may be argued that the mere possibility of harm is not a suf- ficient reason for imposing liability in cases when no actual harm occurred. In part the answer is that the kind of harm involved may be extremely difficult to prove or disprove. A transfer of control may have subtle effects that are hard to detect and harder to prove.35 Employees may leave; morale may suffer; a company may fail to get contracts for which it was being considered. The sort of losses discussed in Feldmann - those related to Feldmann Plan financing and the generation of local patronage - serve more to illustrate that a transfer of controlling shares is likely to have subtle effects, than to demonstrate that the Feldmann case is unique. The possibility or likelihood of subtle adverse effects underlies many of the preventive rules of fiduciary law. If the likely harm is difficult to prove, the question becomes one of balancing the gravity and likelihood of the possible harm against the costs of enforcing a preventive rule.36 Of course a transfer of control may have advantageous effects for a corporation and its stockholders - and these may be just as subtle as any adverse effects. Many sales of controlling shares come about because the selling stockholders are not doing as well with a business as a purchaser believes he can do; and the belief is often right. Often the sellers are members of a family that has simply run out of managerial talent or interest. If the rule of equal opportunity would prevent sales in this 35Essex Universal Corp. v.

Some writers have rejected on this ground any interpretation or extension of Feldmann that would eliminate the issue of harm to the corporation.37 For my own part I do not believe the rule of equal opportunity would have much tendency to discourage beneficial transactions. After all, if the purchaser is optimistic - and can convince his bankers to share his optimism - he should be willing to buy out everyone. If the seller is optimistic about the consequences of the transfer, he should be willing to retain some of his shares. If minority stockholders are optimistic, they should be willing to hold their shares. If the financial community is optimistic (in the case of a publicly held corporation), the market itself should offer the minority stockholders a chance to sell at a price that satisfies the rule. Thus, on the face of it the rule would only operate to pre- vent a sale when all four of these -the seller, the purchaser, the minority stockholders, and the financial community - take a pessimistic view of the transfer.38 (b). - One particular sort of corporate harm that may result from a transfer of controlling shares is the loss of a favorable opportunity for sale of the corporate assets or for a merger.39 The possibility of that sort of harm is virtually inherent in a transfer of controlling shares at a premium, and offers a strong reason for enforcing the rule of equal opportunity. It may be that in a particular case the likelihood of a merger or sale of assets with the person who purchased the stock can be dis- proven. But given a controlling stockholder eager or willing to liquidate his investment, it is virtually impossible to disprove the possibility that an opportunity to sell his shares at a premium operated to prevent the consummation of a sale of assets or merger with someone else. Even if no other potential purchaser is in the picture, it is not unlikely that the controlling stockholder would have found one, but for the opportunity to sell out his own shares directly. The point can be made somewhat differently by emphasizing 37Hill, supra note I5, at I02I-22; Katz, supra note I5, at 379-80; Comment, supra note I5, at 75I. 38 See pp. 522-37 infra for a closer analysis of the reasons why control shares may trade at a premium above minority shares. 39E.g., Commonwealth Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. v.

A merger or sale of assets involves corporate action that automatically produces equality of partici- pation by stockholders in the proceeds of the sale. The law should not offer an alternative in which the controlling stock- holder is enabled to engineer the transaction, without consent from the minority stockholders, to produce a disproportionate return for himself. The point has been made before in connection with cases of a sale of controlling shares involving more or less contempo- raneous sales by other stockholders to the same purchaser at a lower price.40 But it has been argued that this reasoning will not embrace a case like Feldmann, in which the purchaser did not acquire any shares except those of the controlling stockholder.4" Quite obviously, a sale of only the controlling shares does not appear as much like a sale of assets and liquidation of the corpora- tion as does a sale of all the shares. The most important differ- ence, however, is that if the purchaser buys only the controlling shares the minority stockholders have no chance to give or with- hold consent on any terms; this difference calls for more protection, not less. The difference, from another point of view, is essentially one of financing. The purchaser attains control of the corporation's business and assets equally whether he purchases all the shares or a smaller controlling block. When a purchaser buys less than all the shares, he is acquiring a business worth more than what he pays in cash, and is financing the difference by leaving the minority shares outstanding. We think of mortgage debts that way; if a person buys property subject to a mortgage and leaves the mortgage outstanding, we recognize that the mortgage pro- vides financing for the purchaser because it has the same effect, substantially, as a new loan with the proceeds of which the purchaser might have paid full value for the property. But stock provides financing just as much as a mortgage does. A purchaser who buys only part of the stock of an enterprise might have accomplished much the same net result by purchasing all the 40 DODD &amp; BAKER, Note on Problem of Equal Opportunity, Price or Realization, in CASES ON CORPORATIONS 570-79 (2d ed.

The other stockholders in the new corporation would then be viewed as providing equity financing for the acquisition. The chief difference then between a sale of assets, or of all the stock, and a sale of a controlling block of shares only, is that in the latter case the purchaser has had his acquisition partially financed, perhaps unwillingly, by the stockholders from whom he does not buy. That is no reason to give the minority stockholders less protection than if the purchaser gave them an opportunity to sell, even at a lower price. There are, of course, crucial differences between a mortgagee and a minority stockholder. A mortgagee has a dollar claim the amount of which is unaffected by a transfer of the mortgaged property; and he ordinarily has a continuing right to enforce that claim against the transferor. A minority stockholder's claim, on the other hand, is only to share with the controlling stockholder in the profits of the corporate enterprise. A transfer of controlling shares may therefore be objectionable to the minority stock- holder on several grounds not applicable to a mortgagee. The most important of these are (i) that the change in control is likely to have a significant effect on the amount of the profits in which he is thereafter entitled to share; and (2) that the transfer itself produces an element of profit to the old controlling stock- holder in which the minority stockholder is entitled to share. (c). - A somewhat broader way of putting the argument is even simpler: each stockholder is entitled to share proportion- ately in the profits of the enterprise; from the stockholder's point of view a sale of stock is one very important way of realiz- ing a profit on his investment; profits from stock sales ought to be regarded as profits of the enterprise subject to equal sharing among stockholders just as much as profits realized through corporate action. A minority stockholder must invest largely on the strength of the expectation that decisions will tend to be made for his bene- fit because of the general identity of interest between him and those in control. This identity of interest is qualified when con- trolling stockholders have an opportunity to profit by entering into dealings with their corporation; this is permitted because such transactions may be mutually profitable, and there is no way to enforce equality of interest beyond allowing judicial scrutiny of such transactions for fairness. It would be impossible</page><page sequence="18">522 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 to insist, for example, that a publicly held corporation offer all its stockholders a proportionate opportunity to serve in an execu- tive capacity. But when an opportunity arises for profit by selling shares, there is no such simple practical reason why it cannot be made equally available to all stockholders. The proceeds of a sale of shares will not go automatically to all stockholders, as in the case of a dividend or other corporate distribution, because some stockholders may elect not to sell. But this is voluntary; and in a sense it does not represent any departure from equality of profit realization since the stock- holder who elects not to sell can be viewed, in effect, as having realized the offered price for his shares and then having rein- vested it. The situation is analogous to the old-style optional stock dividend where the recipient had his choice of stock or cash; the fact that stockholders chose differently did not upset the equality of treatment required in connection with a corporate dividend.42 If it is important to have equal treatment of stockholders in direct transactions with the corporation -in the distribution of dividends, the counting of votes, and otherwise - it is also important to guarantee equality among stockholders in their re- lation to the market for the corporation's shares. That is all the rule of equal opportunity in the sale of shares seeks to do. 2. Economic Analysis. -The rule of equal opportunity pre- vents a purchaser, in a certain sense, from paying a premium for controlling shares. One way to evaluate the rule, therefore, is to examine the implications of the premium. Does the premium reflect factors that ought properly to enter into an evaluation of the controlling shares? Can the effects of different factors in producing a premium be separated from one another? 43 The assertion that a premium shows controlling shares to be worth more than noncontrolling shares has an important kernel of truth in it. But it needs to be analyzed in terms of the various reasons a purchaser might rationally have for paying a premium, in order to separate that kernel of truth from a considerable amount of chaff. (a). - We can begin with cases already discussed. Why were the purchasers in the looting cases, and in Feldmann, willing to pay a premium? In the looting cases the answer is simple - the 42 See Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. I89, 220 (I920) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) 43 See 219 F.2d at i8o (Swan, J., dissenting).</page><page sequence="19">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 523 premium represents payment for the opportunity to get into a po- sition where the purchaser can steal from the corporation. The courts have recognized this motive, and have relied heavily on the premium paid to reach the conclusion that the sellers had adequate notice of the purchaser's intentions. This reasoning is, of course, particularly persuasive in the case of an investment company where it is hard to imagine other reasons for paying a substantial premium over net asset value.44 It is so persuasive, indeed, that a selling stockholder may be held not only for the premium itself but also for the resulting corporate harm if he fails to draw the inference. Why was Wilport willing to pay a premium for Feldmann's stock? Again the answer is fairly obvious - because it was willing to pay something extra in order to acquire power to control New- port's sales of steel. And again the court recognized this per- fectly clearly when it spoke of the corporate product command- ing a premium in the form of a premium price for stock. Of course, the premium figures somewhat differently in the reasoning and disposition of Feldmann than it did in the looting cases. In the looting cases it is a sign of trouble, and only one measure of liability after trouble actually occurs. In Feldmann the premium is the sole measure, and operates to impose liability even without any very clear indication that trouble, in any conventional sense, actually resulted from the sale. But different as it is from the corporation's standpoint, for the purchaser the significance of the premium is much the same in Feldmann as in the looting cases. In both situations the pur- chaser is paying a premium for an opportunity to profit from his investment in some other way than through dividends and appre- ciation in the value of his stock. In both situations the pur- chaser plans to use his position of control to create additional relationships between himself and the corporation, for his own profit and benefit, and the premium represents payment for that additional expectation of return on his investment. The difference is that the additional relationship in the looting cases - that of embezzler to victim - clearly involves illegal behavior, while the 44 In Gerdes v. Reynolds, 28 N.Y.S.2d 622, 658 (Sup. Ct. I94I), the court made a considerable allowance for leverage because the investment company had debt securities outstanding; but it still found the premium enough to put the sellers on notice of the purchasers' bad intentions.</page><page sequence="20">524 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 additional relation in Feldmann -that of customer to supplier, purchasing at prevailing market prices -is perfectly lawful. I take the chief significance of Feldmann to be that it con- demns a premium paid for the expectation of profits from enter- ing into further relations with the corporation, without regard to the legality of those further relations, and without much regard to whether those further relations are harmful to the corporation in any traditional sense. The court said this quite explicitly when the further relationship is that of customer purchasing from the corporation - "where a call on a corporation's product com- mands an unusually large premium, in one form or another, . . . a fiduciary may not appropriate to himself the value of this premium." 4 But there is no particular reason to confine the rule to purchasers paying a premium in order to become cus- tomers. A premium may just as well be paid because the pur- chaser of controlling shares expects to profit by gaining an outlet for his own product, or employment for himself or his friends and relatives, or any number of other advantages.46 Clearly in any of those events if the purchaser had simply paid the controlling stockholder directly for creating the other relationships, without any purchase and sale of stock, the controlling stockholder would have to account to the corporation for that payment. And there is no reason why such a payment, any more than a premium for the corporate product, should be able to escape accounting simply by taking the form of a premium price for controlling shares. Of course, there is this difference between purchasing a part of the corporate product and entering other relationships: sales of the corporate product to outsiders will ordinarily fix the price at which the controlling stockholder should purchase, whereas in many other cases the requirement of fairness only operates to determine a rather broad range of terms within which the con- trolling stockholder should deal. As a consequence, even when it is known on what terms the purchaser of controlling shares pro- poses to deal, it may be impossible on the face of it to tell whether any part of his stock-purchase price represents a premium paid for the opportunity to deal on those terms. Take, for example, the case of a purchaser who proposes to make himself chief executive officer of his newly acquired corporation. Because it cannot be said whether his services will be worth more or less than the 45 2i9 F.2d at I78. 46 See Jennings, supra note I5, at I4-I9.</page><page sequence="21">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 525 salary for which he proposes to serve, it cannot be determined without further analysis whether indeed he is paying a premium for the opportunity to enter into an employment arrangement unduly favorable to himself. On the other hand the consequence of having available precise going prices for the corporate product has been to avoid the problem of disguised premiums in another way. If there is an established price for a corporation's product, the controlling stockholder can be made to pay that price; and knowing this a purchaser will generally not be willing to pay any substantial pre- mium for the chance to become a customer, since it is generally not a valuable privilege to be able to purchase a product at pre- vailing market prices.47 The Feldmann case is unique in that it involved a reasonably precise market price for the corporate product, but under rather artificial circumstances. Members of the purchasing syndicate were willing to play the game, paying the established price for Newport's product. But in this case the one clear thing was that the price established did not reflect the full amount the purchasers were willing to pay for a sure supply of steel. It might be impossible to say exactly what the purchasers would have paid, in an unrestrained market situation, for con- tracts that would have assured their requirements of steel, but clearly it would have been more than the prevailing market price. It was this premium for steel, forced by the peculiar circum- stances of the case to take the form of a premium price for stock, for which the court required Feldmann to account. As compared with other cases where the value to the purchaser of entering into extra-stockholder relations is not accurately gauged by some objective market figure -all of the cases, for instance, where the purchaser makes himself a paid executive employee of the acquired corporation - Feldmann is only unique for the rather graphic way it displays the relationship between what the corporation gets for its product (or pays for executive services) and what the controlling stockholder gets for his shares. In principle the case of a premium paid by a purchaser for the opportunity of making himself an executive employee, or of making a profit out of any other extra-stockholder relation- 47' 129 F. Supp. at i84.</page><page sequence="22">526 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 ship, is no different from that of a purchaser like Wilport who pays a premium in order to make himself a favored customer. (b). - The most important reason a purchaser might pay a premium for controlling shares, and one that has to be met squarely, is that an investment in controlling shares is a more promising, or at least a safer, investment than one in noncon- trolling shares for the simple reason that it will enable the in- vestor to implement what he believes to be the best policies in the management of his investment.48 Even though the minority stockholder receives exactly the same return per share as does the controlling stockholder, the controlling stockholder has the advantage of knowing that his judgment will prevail whenever there is a difference of view as to how the corporate business should be run. To be more concrete, a prospective purchaser may rationally take the position that he would be willing to pay a substantial price for stock in a corporation if he achieved control, but not a nickel otherwise, because he believes that his manage- ment of the corporation would turn it from a poor investment into a profitable one. The premium paid for control under these circumstances reflects an honest difference of investment ap- praisal, not an intention to realize on the investment through any relationship other than that of stockholder. Even absent any contemplated change in management, control increases the value of an investment by protecting it. The power to change the management, even while unexercised, protects the investor with control against an abrupt change by someone else and against a gradual deterioration of the incumbent manage- ment. Therefore, in a sense, controlling shares are inherently worth more than noncontrolling shares for reasons relating solely to investment value. When control is diffused, the same reason- ing establishes, to a lesser degree, that shares enabling their holder to participate in control are worth more than those that do not. This is the strongest part of any argument against a broad reading of Feldmann. It is the kernel of truth in the assertion that a premium paid for controlling shares only shows that con- trolling shares are inherently worth more than minority shares. It refutes any literal interpretation of the corporate asset theory by showing that control under some circumstances necessarily gives 48 See I 29 F. Supp. at I84.</page><page sequence="23">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 527 an element of value to some shares that it does not give to others. This point tends to explain the cases allowing voting stock to re- ceive more than otherwise identical nonvoting stock in a recapitali- zation.49 Indeed for my own part this point would require rejec- tion of the rule of equal opportunity in the sale of shares, if the rule would prevent a purchaser from acting on this reasoning. The market process would be emasculated if it were unable to re- flect honest differences of investment appraisal arising from a prospective change in management or control of the corporate business and affairs. The rule of equal opportunity does not, however, prevent a purchaser from offering more per share if he acquires control, than if he does not. The rule tends to operate automatically to distinguish between a premium paid for the opportunity of enter- ing into extra-stockholder relations, and one that reflects a change in investment appraisal resulting from a shift in control. This is one of the greatest advantages of the rule of equal opportunity over any corporate asset theory of control, and it needs to be set out and explored in some detail. The word "premium" is frequently used rather loosely. Ap- parently it refers to the excess of the price paid or offered for stock over some normal figure; but often the norm is not pre- cisely specified. It may be prevailing market value. In some cases other factors are considered to arrive at "true" or "intrinsic" value. The court in Feldmann directed the trial court on remand to ascertain the "value of defendant's stock without the appur- tenant control over the corporation's output of steel," and the district court gave heed to the whole range of factors traditionally considered in valuation proceedings. Professor Jennings has used the term "investment value" to refer to something like the figure sought in Feldmann, but stripped more generally of all the ap- purtenant perquisites of corporate control.50 In the present analysis we are not primarily interested in a premium in this sense of an excess over some independently de- termined norm. The focus of the rule of equal opportunity is on why a particular purchaser would pay more per share for some shares than for others. The rule does not prevent a purchaser of controlling shares from offering or paying a price far above the prevailing market, or any other independently determined figure " See pp. 557-58 infra. 50Jennings, supra note I5, at 4, 37; cf. Leech, supra note I5, at 8Ig-20 n.246.</page><page sequence="24">528 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 - it only requires that whatever he offers be offered to all stock- holders alike. To avoid the ambiguous connotations of the word "premium" let us shift to the term "differential." The points to be made are that the differential likely to represent payment for the opportunity to profit from extra-stockholder relations is different from the one that shows a change in investment appraisal associated with a shift in control, and that the rule of equal opportunity tends to impose a burden only with respect to the former. The argument can be made first in relatively abstract terms. Assume that the only factors that would cause a particular pur- chaser to pay more for some shares than for others are the two so far discussed: (a) that he wants to enter into some advantageous extra-stockholder relationship with the corporation, which he can only achieve by gaining control; and (b) that he views the cor- porate stock as a better (safer or more profitable or both) invest- ment if he is in control than if he is not. Assume further that the purchaser can be made to state the top price he would pay for any particular portion of the company's outstanding shares. On these assumptions, if in a particular case the purchaser is only actuated by the second factor - by a difference in invest- ment appraisal associated with his acquisition of control - then the only differential that will appear in his schedule of prices will be a differential between what he will pay per share if he does not achieve control, and what he will pay per share if he does achieve control. There will be no difference between his price per share for a bare controlling block, and his price per share for any larger amount. The return on his investment will be proportionate to the number of shares he owns; therefore he will be willing to pay in proportion to the number of shares he acquires; and his marginal price for supercontrol shares will be equal to what he would pay per share for a controlling block. For this purchaser, in this case, the rule of equal opportunity imposes no burden. The rule per- mits him to condition an offer to purchase at a particular price, on his achieving control. If he purchases a controlling block the rule only requires him to offer the same price per share for more shares, something he should be willing to do in any event. On the other hand, if a purchaser is willing to pay more per share for a barely controlling block of shares than for a larger block - still making the assumptions stated above - this would show that he is actuated in part at least by the first factor, by the</page><page sequence="25">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 529 intention or expectation of enjoying some profit or advantage from entering into some extra-stockholder relationship with his newly acquired corporation. The measure of his investment appraisal with himself in control is the marginal price per share he would pay for shares in excess of those required to achieve control. If he is willing to pay more than that marginal price, for any number of shares, he must be paying for something other than the invest- ment value of the shares. On the assumptions stated above, it must be an intention to derive a profit from some sort of extra- stockholder relationship. And that explanation fits the fact be- cause the profit to be derived from an extra-stockholder relation- ship will be no greater on account of the purchase of supercontrol shares; therefore if a purchaser were motivated by an intention to derive that sort of profit, one would expect him to offer more per share for a controlling block than for supercontrol shares. To put it in figures, suppose a purchaser is willing to pay $3 a share for a small lot of stock, $io a share for 50 + per cent of the corporation's stock, and only $9 a share for all the stock. The offer of $9 a share for all of the stock represents only a marginal price of $8 a share for the last 50 - per cent, since the purchaser is willing to pay $io for the first 50 + per cent. This pattern tends to indicate that the return that the purchaser expects the corpo- ration to produce for its stockholders as such, once he has taken control, justifies a price of $8 a share - while under present con- trol the stock is only worth $3. The purchaser's willingness to pay $io for 50 + per cent, or $9 for all the stock, on the other hand, tends to show that he expects some other return on his investment than the normal return of a stockholder -some element of re- turn that will not be increased through the purchase of more shares. The price he will pay for this element of return is repre- sented by the excess of his offer over $8 a share. In this case the amount is $2 ($io - $8) times 50 per cent of the number of shares outstanding, or $i ($9 - $8) times ioo per cent of the number of shares outstanding. The fact that this is a fixed dollar amount independent of the number of shares purchased is consistent with the assertion that it reflects an expectation of return through some extra-stockholder relationship, since that element of return does not increase with an increase in shareholdings beyond 50 + per cent. The rule of equal opportunity does of course impose a burden with respect to the sort of differential that reflects an intention</page><page sequence="26">530 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 to profit from some extra-stockholder relationship. The rule would tend to prevent the purchaser in the last paragraph from buying out the 50 + per cent stockholder at $io a share, something he would otherwise be willing to do, because if he did he would be re- quired to offer to buy all the stock at that price, which by hypothe- sis he is unwilling to do. The rule does not, however, prohibit a purchaser from paying something in anticipation of extra-stock- holder advantages. The purchaser in the last paragraph is in no way limited to $8 a share; he can offer $9 to everyone and the rule is satisfied even though $i of his purchase price is clearly payment for the expectation of extra-stockholder advantages. Or he can offer $io for 50 + per cent of the shares if the offer is made pro- portionately to everyone. The effect of the rule is not to prohibit a purchaser from paying for extra-stockholder advantages but only to require that, if he does, the payment be offered propor- tionately to all stockholders alike. This is exactly in accord with the outcome in Feldmann. The court there did not seek to bar Wilport from purchasing Newport steel; nor did it seek to make Feldmann return any part of the premium to Wilport; it only re- quired that the premium be divided equally among stockholders. The analysis given so far is admittedly abstract.5" In the real world there are other reasons why a purchaser might offer different prices for different shares, and it remains to examine these. But the present analysis is critically important for showing that a pure investment differential is not affected by the rule of equal oppor- tunity. It shows the possibility of separating the wheat from the chaff in the matter of control premiums, by the operation of a tolerably objective rule. Too often analysis has stopped either with the recognition that a premium may signal the intent to ex- ploit an opportunity not open to all stockholders, or with the un- analyzed assertion in one form or another, that the payment of a premium for controlling stock is perfectly legitimate, an assertion 51 But it is not, I think, too abstract. Consider the concrete case of a purchaser of controlling shares who claims he is paying a premium over market value solely because he expects to be able to run the business at a more profitable level than that on which the current market price is based. The seller is less sanguine about the chances of improving on current performance, and is concerned, for legal or other reasons, about the purchaser's real intentions. Is it not a fairly practical probe of his intentions to demand that he offer to buy from everyone? Refusal will not prove his intentions to be bad, but at least it will require a new explanation- he cannot assert that the corporation whose value is enhanced when he takes over will decline in value if he takes over too much.</page><page sequence="27">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 531 I take to reflect, at best, a recognition of the interrelation between control and investment value discussed under (b) above. Those who have recognized the latter point, one way or another, have generally concluded that the fact of a sale at a premium cannot be asserted as a basis of liability without some independent evidence of the likelihood of harm to the corporation. The importance of the present analysis is that it provides an escape from that con- clusion. (c). - What else, besides the hope of exploiting some extra- stockholder relationship, might account for a purchaser's willing- ness to pay more per share for controlling shares than for super- control shares? One answer is lack of funds; the purchaser just may not have the wherewithal to pay what he views as a fair price, or indeed, perhaps, any price, for additional shares, after he has paid for the controlling block. Of course lack of funds, in the simplest sense, is the common plight of businessmen; many forms of financial organization exist just to answer the promoter's need for other people's funds to carry out his business ideas. The purchaser of a controlling interest in a corporation, if he pays any premium for his shares, is in a way a promoter, speculating on the profitability of a new combination between his talents and the purchased company's property and business. If he has not sufficient funds of his own to meet a re- quirement that he bid for all the shares, the requirement does not exclude him from the market; it only requires him to arrange fi- nancing. The financing, of course, may take any of a variety of forms. If the purchaser can convince others to share his optimistic view of the corporation's future under his control, then it can take the form of a simple participation by those others in the purchase. One potential source of financing, in effect, is from the present minority stockholders themselves. If the purchaser can convince them that their stock will soon be worth the price he is paying for the controlling stockholder's shares, once the purchaser is in con- trol, then they will turn down his offer to buy their shares at that price and the effect will be the same as if he found someone else to make the purchase. In a sense the question is whether the minority stockholders should be given a choice whether or not to invest, at the same price as the purchaser, in the new enterprise resulting from the shift in control. Thus, even if a purchaser offering a favorable price for control-</page><page sequence="28">532 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 ling shares were unconditionally required to extend the same offer to all stockholders, the requirement could be defended as designed to assure that the price paid represents a bona fide investment ap- praisal of the enterprise. Proof of the bona fides of an investment appraisal requires that someone back it with cash; the question here is how broadly the bet has to be backed before the game will be played. Inevitably the prospective purchaser's investment ap- praisal of the corporation under his own control must be backed by sufficient funds to buy out the existing control group; the question is whether to require backing sufficient to offer the other stock- holders an equal opportunity to sell. Enforcement of the rule of equal opportunity, as indicated be- fore, leaves another opening for a purchaser who cannot pay for all the shares. Such a purchaser is free to limit his offer any way he wishes, provided whatever offer he does make is made equally available to all stockholders. People who argue against any ex- tension of Feldmann point out that sometimes minority stock- holders will benefit from a change in control to which they are not parties - perhaps by as much as the premium paid to the sellers of the controlling block.52 The rule of equal opportunity puts it up to the principals to demonstrate that this is a reasonable expecta- tion. The purchaser can prove that he thinks so by offering to buy everyone out at the same price. If the purchaser cannot or will not do that, the seller can prove that he has an optimistic view of the corporation's prospects by tendering his shares pursuant to an offer to purchase pro rata from all who tender, so that he takes his chance of continuing his investment under the new management to the same extent, proportionately, as his fellow stockholders. It is only if neither the purchaser nor the seller will give the minority any option that the minority stockholders are effectively enabled to prevent the sale of the controlling shares. I hasten to acknowledge that a controlling seller's willingness to sell all his shares at a price at which he would not sell less, does not prove that he expects harm to come to the corporation from the shift in control. On a partial sale, his remaining shares will be- come noncontrolling shares and subject to the risks of minority ownership, from which previously they were protected; and a seller might perfectly rationally, therefore, insist on something to compensate for that loss in value of his remaining investment. 52 Hill, supra note I:5, at i o i i.</page><page sequence="29">1965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 533 But this way of satisfying the rule is only an alternative to fall back on if the purchaser is unable otherwise to finance an offer for all the outstanding shares. Indeed, if a purchaser offers to buy less than all the shares, he is in effect seeking to have his purchase financed by the stockholders whose shares he does not purchase. Enforcement of equal opportunity in the sale of shares thus per- mits the controlling stockholder to compel his minority stockhold- ers to participate in the financing only to the same degree, pro- portionately, as he is willing to participate himself. This is the general and familiar, albeit implicit, measure of the controlling stockholder's power to involve his minority stockholders in new business risks through corporate action; it seems appropriate enough when the same result is to be achieved through a sale of shares. (d). - Another reason a purchaser may be unwilling to pay as much for other shares as for the controlling block is simply that he thinks the minority stockholders will sell for less. Assume that a majority of a corporation's shares are owned by a family group; management, consisting of part of the family group, is not strong; minority shares are publicly held and traded over the counter. Not infrequently the outside shares will trade at a considerable dis- count from even what current earnings would indicate to be a reasonable price. The family wants to get out - but at a price that more nearly represents at least current earning performance. A purchaser is found for the family shares who is perfectly willing to buy on the basis of current earnings since he feels that with his proposed management changes earnings will be even better. This price is nothing more than investment value as the purchaser ap- praises it. But why buy from the minority at that price? If even a comparatively few shares can be acquired at or near the present discounted market price, the purchaser's profit will be more than if he buys at the price he is paying for the controlling shares. This is perfectly good, sound business sense. Value is always a matter of what a purchaser will pay and a seller will demand. A rational purchaser will hardly ever offer or pay more than he thinks his seller will demand. But as an objection to the rule of equal opportunity in the sale of shares, this reason simply begs the question. It only says a purchaser may rationally decline to make an equal offer to everyone if he is permitted to discriminate; but whether he should be permitted to discriminate is the question at issue. Furthermore, it is circular in another way to object to</page><page sequence="30">534 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 the rule of equal opportunity on the basis of the fact that minority stockholders are frequently willing to sell for less than those in control. Just as a rational purchaser will offer no more than he thinks his seller will demand, a rational seller will not sell for less than he is offered. Outside stockholders would not sell for less, therefore, if the purchaser were compelled to offer them the same price as he pays for the controlling shares. It is of course true that requiring an equal offer to all stock- holders will take some of the profit o-ut of an acquisition, if the purchaser could otherwise have acquired some shares for less. I am doubtful that this element of profit is often a significant factor in determining whether or not to make a purchase. Some- times, indeed, a purchaser agrees to indemnify a seller of con- trolling shares, by purchasing from other stockholders at the same price if a cause of action is established against the seller under Feldmann. The reason the purchaser is willing to give the indem- nity is, at least in part, that the shares are worth, on an earning basis, what he is paying. It comes down to the proposition that he is willing to pay the same price for all the shares, but only if he must. Furthermore, if a case arises where the availability of outside shares at a lower price tips the balance of profitability on the whole deal, the equal opportunity requirement is not an absolute bar since it does not prevent the purchaser from buying first from the minority stockholders, provided he discloses to them that he is about to pay the control group more per share. In addition, it does not prevent him from contracting with either group first on a conditional basis in order to be sure he gets a control block of shares at a satisfactory average price. Thus the requirement of equal opportunity is not a bar, but more in the nature of a pro- cedural safeguard. It operates chiefly to strengthen the hands of the minority stockholders by preventing the principals from threatening to go forward without offering them anything for their shares.53 (e). One sometimes hears a purchaser say he will pay more for controlling shares because they are worth more to their seller than minority shares are to minority stockholders, for the wholly legitimate reasons set out under (b) above. The controlling stock- holder may even have paid more for his shares, directly or in- "' See PP. 558-6i infra.</page><page sequence="31">_9651 STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 535 directly, because of their control status. Indeed this is very likely so, though not demonstrably, in the common case in which the controlling group started an enterprise and then sold shares to out- siders without relinquishing control. Whatever the relation be- tween the original investment of the two groups it seems likely that the circumstance of control being locked in the inside group would be one factor entering into the determination, and that the effect of that circumstance, however great or small, would be to depress the price paid by the minority stockholders. This reason for paying a premium, however, is of a different order from any discussed above. Reasons (a) through (d) explain why a purchaser's self-interest might lead him to be willing to pay more for some shares than for others; they would cut against the rule only if they showed a kind of motivation on the part of purchasers that the law ought not to discourage. This reason, however, has nothing to do with why, in his own self-interest, a purchaser would pay more for some shares than for others. The answer to that question is still to be found under (d); it is in the purchaser's interest never to pay more than he has to pay for any- thing. This reason (e) attempts to deal directly with the ques- tion whether the law ought to require an equal offer to everyone. The trouble with reason (e) is that it proves too much. It is true that in a certain perfectly legitimate sense controlling shares have a higher investment value than noncontrolling shares. It is further true that sometimes the holders of controlling shares have in effect paid something for their protected position. But it does not follow that when the time comes to sell - to terminate the controlling stockholder's position of control - he is entitled to realize more for his investment, share for share, than are the mi- nority stockholders. Consider a sale of assets and liquidation. Clearly in that case inside and minority stockholders share alike; the insiders get no bonus to reflect the greater investment value of their holdings. The advantage the controlling insiders have with respect to a sale of assets and liquidation is that they can determine whether or not, and when and how, it will occur. But the limit on their ad- vantage is that whatever they arrange must be for the precisely proportionate benefit of all the stockholders. The increased value of their shares while the corporation continues in existence, there- fore, is something that is spent, in the very nature of the thing, in the implementation of the decision to sell and liquidate.</page><page sequence="32">536 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 The same can be said of a sale of controlling shares. The con- trolling stockholder's advantage is that he alone can determine whether there will be a sale based on a shift in control, and when, and at what price. Until he does decide to sell, the minority stock- holders may have no chance to sell at any price. It is a bootstrap argument to say that since the controlling stockholder's power to determine when and whether there will be a sale makes his shares worth more than others, he should be entitled to arrange the sale to secure for himself a higher price than others are offered. (f). - Finally, a purchaser might be willing to pay more for a controlling stockholder's shares than for other shares simply be- cause it costs more to do business with a multitude of minority stockholders than with one controlling stockholder. The additional costs of purchasing from other stockholders include cash expenses for preparing and delivering an offer, lawyers' fees, in some cases probably fees to a bank for acting as depository for tendered shares, and the expenses associated with arranging additional financing. An even more important element of cost, perhaps, is the delay and un- certainty involved in dealing with a large number of people in- stead of only one. It will take several weeks at least to know how many minority stockholders wish to sell out; a deal with the con- trolling stockholder alone can be worked out in a few days. I see no a priori basis for excluding this reason as one the market ought not to reflect; and yet enforcement of the rule of equal opportunity would prevent acting on it. The rule would therefore load the costs of dealing with minority stockholders onto the price of dealing with a controlling stockholder. This effect can be re- garded, in large measure, as representing the cost of enforcing the rule of equal opportunity, and the ultimate question to be asked is whether the benefits to be achieved are worth this cost. This idea may take different forms.54 It can be expressed, for example, from 54 One rather ingenious line of reasoning would seek to justify at least a modest premium over public market price by asserting that the purchaser wants a public market, that he declines to buy from the public because that would dry up the public market, and that the differential between his price for controlling shares and the market price for minority shares simply reflects the value to him of having a public market. From the seller's point of view the premium is justified, then, as a means of recovering the costs - underwriting discounts and expenses - incurred in initially establishing a public market. But if the existence of a public market en- hances the value of controlling shares, then the burden of establishing or main- taining such a market should be borne by the controlling stockholder, as it is when he sells shares to an underwriter at a discount from the public offering price. In the situation under discussion, the minority stockholders are being asked to bear</page><page sequence="33">x9651 STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 537 the viewpoint of the seller who may have incurred selling costs in finding a purchaser and negotiating a favorable price. The rule of equal opportunity prevents a controlling stockholder from recover- ing these costs by selling at a higher price than is offered to others who have not borne this expense. Again this effect must be re- garded as part of the cost of enforcing the rule, and weighed against the benefits to be achieved, in determining whether or not to adopt and enforce the rule. It is impossible to put precise dollar figures on these elements of cost. Before reaching any judgment I would ask a reader to consider the refinements and qualifications discussed in section B at pages 545-50 below, which indicate that existing market mech- anisms may operate in many cases to satisfy the rule. Also it should be noted that the rule never prevents the purchaser and controlling stockholder from negotiating their own deal in private, and from contracting on either a firm or conditional basis prior to any public offer or agreement. Furthermore, in assessing the net cost of adopting the approach urged here, one should weigh the considerable amount of legal uncertainty that already surrounds a purchase and sale of controlling shares under any other interpreta- tion of existing precedents. The rule of equal opportunity would eliminate, for example, the cost of litigating, as in Feldmann it- self, investment value shorn of particular elements of control.55 My own judgment is that the problems with which the rule would deal are sufficiently serious to warrant the cost of enforce- ment. Argument against the rule on the basis of costs is reminis- cent of objections to federal securities legislation.56 My guess is that, as with securities legislation, the costs would not seriously im- pair the transaction of business; and as in the case of most of the requirements of the federal securities laws, I think the costs are es- sentially just part of the price that must be paid for dealing with public stockholders. the burden of selling (if at all) at a discount from the price at which controlling shares are being bought. From the minority stockholders' point of view, it is im- possible to justify offering them less, by reference to the fact that they once paid more, than the price at which controlling stockholders sell. If in fact the existence of a public market operates to enhance the value of controlling shares, it is not unreasonable to require that any activity in the market for controlling shares be made to support the value of minority shares by requiring both, in effect, to be traded on a single market open to all stockholders alike. 5 See pp. 550-5I infra. 56 See generally i Loss, SECURITIES REGULATION 370-73 (2d ed.

Theoretical Considerations. - Some will object to the rule of equal opportunity, without even reaching the questions dis- cussed in the last section, on the ground that it is inconsistent with our accepted conceptual analysis of corporate relationships. A stockholder's rights are wholly derivative, so he is not injured in the absence of harm to the corporation. Or, viewed from the other end, a controlling stockholder's fiduciary duties run only to his corporation, not to his fellow stockholders directly. The whole attitude may be summed up by the assertion that shares of stock are personal property with which a stockholder can do as he wishes.57 This position is closely related to our concept of the corporation as a separate legal entity and a creature of the sovereign will.58 As such it is an entity unaffected by transfers in ownership of its shares.59 If the corporation is not directly affected by a transfer of its shares then other stockholders, whose only relation to the transfer is through the corporation, can hardly be injured thereby. One answer to this objection is simply to reject the separate entity notion as a true or useful description of corporate relation- ships.60 A corporation, like a partnership, is essentially nothing more or less than the people who make it up, associated for the operation of a common business enterprise. There are, to be sure, substantive differences between the law of corporations and the law of partnerships, but these are differences in the terms of association dictated by reasons of convenience and policy, not the consequences of any essential difference between the nature of a corporation and that of a partnership. In particular the rule of full and free transferability of shares is a term, not a condition, of corporate organization.6' It is part of the corporate authority structure that all the rights of a stockholder as such to participate in corporate decision making may be exercised by his assignee. On " See Gerdes v. Reynolds, 28 N.Y.S.2d 622, 649 (SuP. Ct. I941); Jennings, supra note 15, at 6. 58 Cf. Manning, supra note 27, for a brilliant analysis of the effect of that con- ception in producing the present erratic pattern of availability of the stockholder's appraisal remedy. 59 See, e.g., Old Dominion Copper Mining &amp; Smelting Co. v. Lewisohn, 210 U.S. 2o6, 2i6 (ig08) ("the [fundamental] conception that a corporation remains un- changed and unaffected in its identity by changes in its members"). 60 E.g., STEVENS, PRIVATE CORPORATIONS 45-46 (2d ed. I949). 61 See Tu-Vu Drive-In Corp. v. Ashkins, 6i Cal. 2d 288, 39I P.2d 828, 38 Cal. Rptr. 348 (i964), for an indication that it is even a term subject to alteration by simple majority vote.</page><page sequence="35">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 539 the other hand, it is simply part of the corporate benefit struc- ture that a stockholder is permitted to realize a profit on his in- vestment by selling on the market at whatever price an outsider will pay.62 If the right to profit by selling on the market is con- ceived as part of the corporate benefit structure, it is perfectly natural that the market should be regulated to whatever degree is required to assure stockholders an equal opportunity to participate. I am reluctant, however, to rest exclusively on outright rejec- tion of the concept of the corporation as a separate legal entity. Particularly in the case of a publicly held corporation the concept seems to express too much of the truth to be rejected out of hand. But the concept plays several roles, and I think careful analysis will show that its principal success relates to roles that do not im- pugn the approach of this article to the problem of sales of con- trolling shares. The central feature of corporate organization of business enter- prise is separation of the conduct of business affairs from the allocation of beneficial enjoyment of the profits. The conduct of business affairs is committed to a centralized management group. Business is organized mostly through contracts and property trans- fers carried out by authority of the corporate management in the name of the corporation itself. Ultimate beneficial enjoy- ment of the profits of the enterprise is organized, on the other hand, through ownership of shares of stock. Changes are effected on a wholly decentralized basis by individual stockholders transferring their shares in essentially the same manner as any other property. The most important role of the corporation as a separate legal entity is to provide a conceptual framework for this separate or- ganization of corporate business and beneficial ownership. The corporate entity serves as the focal point for organizing business transactions; as such it is conceived as being unaffected by stock transfers. On the other hand, the corporation serves as the object of stock ownership, through which beneficial enjoyment of busi- ness profits is organized; and in this capacity it is conceived as essentially unaffected by particular business transactions. 62 The court in Tu-Vu Drive-In Corp. v. Ashkins, 6i Cal. 2d 288, 39I P.2d 828, 38 Cal. Rptr. 348 (i964), intimated that a bylaw setting limits on the price for which a stockholder could sell would be invalid if adopted with less than unani- mous consent. Some lawyers will think the decision unrealistic insofar as it de- pends on the argument that a first-refusal type of bylaw restricts only the person to whom a stockholder may sell, not his price, since it is widely felt that in practice a first-refusal bylaw tends strongly to chill the bidding.</page><page sequence="36">540 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 This separation between business transactions and changes in beneficial ownership is only a partial, and rather formal, separa- tion. The stockholder's interest may be conceived formally as an interest in the corporation, unaffected by corporate business trans- actions, but it is perfectly clearly in substance an interest in the profits of the corporate business, vitally affected by such transac- tions. Without that substantive relationship stock ownership would be meaningless; and the function of corporate organization must be to assure that stock ownership does represent, ultimately, a decently protected interest in the profits of the corporate busi- ness. The separation is only partial in the other direction, too. Thus although immediate control over corporate affairs is unaffect- ed by ordinary stock market transactions, ultimate control is made to depend upon stock ownership. The purpose of corporate organization is not to isolate control of business management from stock ownership, or the benefits of stock ownership from the effect of business transactions, but to make the relationship between them such that attention can be directed to either without im- mediate concern for the details of the other. Our formal concep- tion of the corporation as a separate legal entity, essentially un- affected either by business transactions or stock transactions, serves well to emphasize the separation we make of immediate authority over the two. But separation of immediate authority is only part of the story, and to express the ultimate interrelationship of the two we should conceive of the corporation functionally as a focus of interaction between two related spheres of activity. It is this interaction -making it possible for a premium for the corporate product to take the form of a premium for the corporation's stock - with which Feldmann and the rule of equal opportunity are concerned. A second role the separate-entity concept has played is to pro- vide a means for describing and proscribing certain abuses of the corporate mechanism. If the function of corporate organization is to create transferable interests in the profits of its business, it is an abuse to permit diversion of profits from the stockholders through business transactions between the corporation and its officers or directors, on terms unduly favorable to the latter. We use the separate-entity concept to describe this sort of abuse with- out reference to the stockholders, by saying that an unfair trans- action with an insider injures the corporation itself. Directors</page><page sequence="37">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 54I and officers owe a fiduciary duty to the corporation, we say, to deal with it only on fair terms. There are four principal points to be made about this second use of the corporate-entity concept. First, this second use is quite different from the first. In the first use the corporate entity was something unaffected by changes in stock ownership or by business transactions, a purely formal concept serving as a focal point or vehicle for the organization of real interests of real people. In this second use the corporate entity is less formal; it is described as suffering injury, and as having interests of its own to be pro- tected -as being the one, indeed, for whose sake fiduciary obli- gations are imposed. We might call the corporate entity as it appears in this second use the anthropomorphic corporate entity, as opposed to the formal corporate entity involved in the first use. Second, like the formal entity, the anthropomorphic corporate entity provides a convenient framework for expressing a number of perfectly sound rules and policy decisions. These have mostly to do with remedies: an individual stockholder cannot sue in his own name for an injury to the corporation;63 relief is ordinarily awarded to the corporation, not to its stockholders individually;"' therefore, in the case of a transfer of shares between the date of the wrong complained of and the date relief is granted, it is the stockholders on the latter date, ordinarily, who share, indirectly, in the benefit derived from the recovery.65 Third, again as in the case of the formal concept, the anthro- pomorphic concept expresses only one side of the truth. In sub- stance the controversy over an injury to the corporation lies be- tween the accused officers or directors and the other stockholders. And for some purposes this view of the controversy supersedes the corporate injury concept: a volunteer stockholder is permitted to bring and maintain the suit for redress, albeit derivatively in the corporate name; 66 consent or acquiescence by all stockholders is a defense;67 in some states a stockholder who became such after the wrong complained of (except by operation of law) is not en- 63 Liken v.

Whatever its merits for describing unfair corporate transactions, those just are not the only kind of abuse of the corporate mechanism with which the law must deal. The clearest proof of this assertion lies in the history of our treatment of insiders' stock transactions conducted on the basis of inside information. It was originally argued, and occasionally held, that corporate insiders were under no fiduciary obligations with respect to their private stock transactions pre- cisely because such transactions did no harm to the corporation as distinct from its stockholders.70 Most courts finally either rejected this argument,7' or qualified the conclusion by ruling that special facts might give rise to a duty of disclosure before an insider could purchase shares.72 Nevertheless, in I934 the Congress found the problem serious enough to call for the harsh remedies and the crude rule of thumb of section i6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act.73 The courts have given that section a generous reception, even intimating that an analogous result might have been reached without legislation.74 And in a parallel development the courts have built a considerable edifice of protection against misuse of inside information in corporations not covered by section i6(b), all on the rather slender statutory base of section io(b) of the same statute.75 Most recently the Congress has vastly extended the coverage of section i6(b), by making it applicable to corpora- tions with substantial assets and a substantial number of stock- 68 Home Fire Ins.

Indeed, the transac- tion involved in Feldmann was itself made the subject of a suit under rule io(b) (5); and the court dismissed on the ground that protection under the rule extended only to sellers (or perhaps buyers) of securities, not to persons who never had a chance to sell.77 If Feldmann does not come within the market-regulatory provisions designed to deal with insider trading, because the com- plainants are neither buyers nor sellers, the result, if sound, so the argument goes, must depend on harm, or the possibility of harm to the corporation. But the insider trading and corporate transac- tion problems are not unrelated. Part of the reason an insider is subject to fiduciary duties in the purchase of stock is because of the equivalence in effect between a stock purchase and a purchase of assets from the corporation. Consider a 6o per cent stockholder buying out the owner of the other 40 per cent; the effect of pur- chasing the 40 per cent stock interest is much the same (putting aside tax consequences) as if the 6o per cent stockholder caused a corporate sale of assets to himself. In either case the substance of the transaction is that the majority stockholder is buying out the minority stockholder's interest. It is perfectly true that the insider's duty with respect to a stock purchase is defined differ- ently from his duty with respect to an asset purchase. With respect to a stock purchase his primary duty is one of disclosure of rele- vant information, while in the purchase of assets his duty is to deal fairly. But this difference reflects only the fact that the in- sider has authority to act for the minority stockholder in a cor- porate sale of assets, while the minority stockholder acts for him- self in a sale of his stock. The purpose of the duty in either case is to protect the minority stockholder against the same abuse namely liquidation of his investment at an unfair price. Other situations illustrate the inseparability of problems of fairness in stock transactions and in corporate transactions. What, 6 Act of Aug. 20, i964, Pub.

One court has dis- missed a complaint by a stockholder from whom shares were pur- chased by the corporation, on the ground that the management's fiduciary duty ran primarily, at least, to the corporation in a transaction between it and its stockholders.78 That result is ques- tionable; in any event the reasoning is specious. The judgment just has to be made, in such a case, on the basis of what will pro- mote fair dealing in corporate shares, rather than what will pro- tect the corporate interest as against its stockholders.79 The interrelationship between unfair corporate transactions and unfair stock transactions is probably focused as clearly as any- where in cases involving promoters' liability for secret profits. A corporation buys mining property from its promoters, at an in- flated value, before anyone else has purchased stock; thereafter stock is sold for cash to the public. The Supreme Court found no liability in such a situation, since the harm to the corporation oc- curred at a time when there were no stockholders eligible to com- plain.80 The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court imposed lia- bility, pointing out the substantial equivalence in result whatever the order of the transactions.8' The only significant difference is that having caused the corporation to acquire the mining proper- ties before issuing its stock to the public, the promoters could have validated the corporate acquisition of the mining property by full disclosure of the material facts, in connection with the stock issue, instead of by disinterested corporate action.82 The substantive effect of the sale of mining properties to the corporation together with the sale of shares to the public is to sell to the public a part interest (indirect) in the promoters' property. Such a transaction, to be binding, must either be accepted, with knowledge, by the stockholders buying in, or must be approved through disinterested corporate action. But the abuse - sale of an interest in property at an unfair price - is one and the same whether we think in terms 78 Gladstone v. Murray Co., 314 Mass. 584, 50 N.E.2d 958 (I943). " Cf. Wood v.

Feldmann itself is centrally concerned with another mode of interaction between corporate transactions and stock transactions - the interaction that occurs when imperfections or impurities in the markets in which a corporation deals cause demands in those markets to be reflected in the market for the corporation's stock, in a manner that gives some stockholders an opportunity to profit to the exclusion of their fellows. All this interaction between stock transactions and corporate transactions indicates to me the need to formulate some unified interpretation of the problem of fiduciary duties in the corporate context. Manifestly the separate-entity concept of the corporation offers no such prospect because it simply does not reach questions of fairness in stock transactions. On the other hand the functional concept of a corporation, as a focus of interaction between stock transactions and corporate transactions, does offer the possibility of a unified interpretation of fiduciary duties. The test of the scope of fiduciary duties from this standpoint is simply what is necessary to prevent any employ- ment of the corporate form that will destroy the equality of profit opportunity among stockholders on which the corporate relation is predicated. Any such employment of the corporate form is an abuse to be prohibited, whether the inequality of profit oppor- tunity presents itself as a chance to deal with the corporation or a chance to deal in the market for the corporation's stock. Feld- mann's liability is therefore properly predicated on the fact that he sold his stock at a price not available to other stockholders, without regard to whether he caused any harm to the corporation conceived as an entity separate and apart from its stockholders; and the rule of equal opportunity represents an exploration of the scope of the Feldmann ruling from this point of view. B. Qualifications As initially stated the rule of equal opportunity would require an offer to buy from minority stockholders any time there is a sale of controlling shares. And theoretically, from the point of view implicit in the rule, controlling stock is any stock for which a purchaser would be willing to pay more than he would pay for other shares. In practice, however, there are a number of situa- tions in which the reasons for the rule would not seem to require</page><page sequence="42">546 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 any affirmative offer to minority stockholders. Therefore, the initial broad statement can be qualified in several respects. i. When There Is an Established Market for a Corporation's Stock. - No affirmative offer to minority stockholders is required if they have an opportunity to sell on some established market at the same price as is paid for the controlling shares. This is not because the market is a reliable indicator of value proving that the sale of controlling shares was not at a premium, but rather because the market can be taken as performing the principals' duty for them. Indeed, the requirement of the rule of equal oppor- tunity can be viewed as a requirement to provide a market on which to sell; there is no need to do that if a market which meets the requirement already exists. Under what conditions can the market be regarded as satisfy- ing the requirements of the rule? What if the price at which con- trolling shares are sold is just slightly higher than the prevailing market? Or suppose it is higher than the bid price but no higher or even lower than the asked price. It will be urged, particularly if there is no dramatic accompanying change in management, that it ought at least to be open to the parties to show that the deviation from market represents only a saving in expenses such as broker- age commissions, or dealers' margins. These arguments are not without weight, although they appear to concern small differentials. I would be inclined to make the bid price the test, leaving it to each party to pay his own broker's commissions, if any. The harder question is the converse: Is it enough to avoid lia- bility that the sale is at or below the market price? And at what point in time is market price to be taken? It should be kept in mind that market price is significant not as an indicator of value in some abstract sense, but because the market itself provides minority stockholders an opportunity to sell at the market price. The minority stockholders ought to have an opportunity to sell at the same price, with knowledge, or an opportunity to know, of any significant changes in the conduct of the corporate business accompanying the transfer of controlling shares. Therefore, the mere fact that the sale price for a block of controlling shares is not above market should not offer a defense if the market falls soon after the transfer of control. The subsequent market decline operates to deny other stockholders any effective equal oppor- tunity in the sale of shares, whether the decline reflects an ad- verse reaction to the shift of control or just that the market was</page><page sequence="43">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 547 thin. Therefore, the test of whether the market operates to satisfy the rule is whether it goes to or stays at or above the sale price for the controlling shares long enough to give minority stockholders a reasonable chance to sell at or above that price, after learning of the transfer of control. What is a controlling block for purposes of the rule? 83 The reasons for the equal opportunity rule would seem to indicate that it is any block of shares carrying any power for which a pur- chaser might pay a premium.84 This definition suggests that any shares selling above the market should be regarded as controlling shares. For this purpose the relevant market price is that on the date of sale, not thereafter, and the critical figure is net cost to the purchaser. The converse, of course, is not true. Controlling shares may well sell at or below the market price on the date of sale, any premium for control being offset by the factor of blockage. When sale oc- curs at or below the market price, and the market price subse- quently drops below the sale price for the controlling shares, a court must simply make a judgment on all the facts whether an opportunity to participate in control was likely a significant factor affecting the sale. Whether there are changes in directors or management personnel accompanying the sale is perhaps the best touchstone for making this judgment.85 2. When There Is No Established Market for a Corporation's Stock. - The conclusion in the last section with respect to a cor- poration whose stock has an established market can be restated to indicate that an affirmative purchase offer must be made to other stockholders in connection with any sale of shares, unless the market makes a similar price available to other stockholders either on the date of sale or during some reasonable period thereafter. If this conclusion, stated this way, were applied in the case of a corporation whose stock has no established market, the effect 83The question of defining a control block usually arises in determining the legality of a change of directors. See pp. 556-57 infra. Compare Essex Universal Corp. v. Yates, 305 F.2d 572 (2d Cir. i962) (28.3% of stock in widely held corpo- ration said to be generally recognized as a controlling interest), with In re Caplan, 2o App. Div. 2d 30I, 246 N.Y.S.2d 9I3, aff'd mem., I4 N.Y.2d 679, i98 N.E.2d go8, 249 N.Y.S.2d 877 (i964) (W% of stock held not to be controlling interest). 84 Cf. Young v. Higbee, 324 U.S. 204 (I945) (preferred stockholders who had appealed in reorganization case required to account to other preferred stockholders for premium on sale of shares after appeal period had run out). 85 Cf. Leech, Transactions in Corporate Control, I04 U. PA. L. REV. 725, 808 (I956).</page><page sequence="44">548 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 would be to require all stock sales to be consummated pursuant to purchase offers communicated to all stockholders. The effect would be to require stockholders to maintain an orderly market for their corporation's stock, and to prohibit transactions outside of that market. Ideally that result has something to recommend it, but I think it would go too far. In the absence of an established market a seller of even a small lot of shares may have to invest a substantial amount of money and effort in the project of finding a purchaser. To require the purchaser's offer then to be communicated to all stockholders would be in effect to compel the seller to share with his fellow stockholders the return on this investment which he has made out of his own resources. This would be an undesirable result; it would tend to discourage otherwise useful selling efforts; and nothing in the reasons for the rule of equal opportunity re- quires it. Rejection of this conclusion can be rationalized, if necessary, by hypothesizing that other stockholders could have sold at the same price - if they had only made the same selling efforts, with the same luck.86 Application of the rule of equal opportunity to require an affirm- ative offer to purchase from minority stockholders, therefore, in the case of a corporation whose stock has no established market, will always depend upon a judgment as to whether the shares sold carry enough control to have any significant effect on the sale price. Again I suspect the question whether there are changes in directors or management personnel in connection with the sale of shares is the best touchstone, though not to be given conclusive effect, for making that judgment. 3. What Sort of Offer to Other Stockholders Will Satisfy the Rule. - Assuming an affirmative offer to purchase from minority stockholders is required, what sort of offer to such stockholders will satisfy the rule? The main problem concerns differences in the form of the consideration. Not uncommonly a corporate pur- chaser buys out a controlling stockholder for cash and then merges the acquired corporation into itself. Under what conditions, if any, should the merger proposal be considered to satisfy the re- 86 A controlling stockholder may also have selling costs, the fruits of which the rule of equal opportunity will force him to share with other stockholders. See pp. 536-37 supra. But a controlling stockholder could perhaps have arranged to have the selling costs borne by all stockholders through the corporation by negotiating for a corporate sale of assets instead of a personal sale of stock.</page><page sequence="45">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 549 quirement of an equal offer to other stockholders? The answer seems clearly to be if, but only if, the market price of the stock received on the merger is equal, for a reasonable length of time, to the cash price paid for the controlling shares. Again this con- clusion does not rest on any misapprehension that market value is the exclusive - or even a particularly good - measure of in- trinsic value. Rather it results from the fact that the market offers a cash alternative, and that the only thing that will match the controlling stockholder's receipt of cash for his shares is a reasonable opportunity for the minority stockholders to realize cash in the same amount. The problem is much harder when it comes up the other way- when the controlling stockholder receives stock or other securities for his shares and the other stockholders are offered only cash. Under certain circumstances receipt of stock may have significant tax advantages over receipt of cash. Furthermore, when the ac- quiring corporation's stock is not publicly traded, a particular stockholder may regard a chance to invest in the acquiring cor- poration as a very valuable opportunity. But there are substantial counterconsiderations. The acquiring corporation may take an interest in the identity of its stockholders and be unwilling to issue its shares to all the holders of shares of the acquired corporation. More particularly, the acquiring corporation may be unwilling to register under the Securities Act of I933 87 as would be required in order to make a general exchange offer if the acquired corpora- tion's stock is even moderately widely held. Moreover, it is impossible to secure absolute equality of oppor- tunity in all respects arising out of a transfer of shares. The con- trolling stockholder of the acquired corporation may, for example, be offered employment by the acquiring corporation; clearly that cannot be offered proportionately to all stockholders of the old corporation, and the other stockholders will have no right to ob- ject unless they can show that what appears as compensation for services is in reality additional compensation for the sale of cor- porate shares or assets.88 This is so even if the employment con- tract and the transfer of stock or assets are made conditional upon each other. Similarly, an exchange of stock for stock could be set up in the form of two cash sales, at the same cash price. If 87 48 Stat. 74, as amended, I5 U.S.C. ? 77a (I958). 88 Smith v. Good Music Station, Inc., 36 Del. Ch. 262, I29 A.2d 242 (Ch. I957). But cf. Stanton v. Hample, 272 Fed. 424 (gth Cir. I92I).</page><page sequence="46">550 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 that were done, then the purchase of shares in the acquiring cor- poration by the old controlling stockholder ought not to give the other stockholders any right to complain unless the price was un- fairly low. The fact that the transaction takes the form of an exchange instead of mutually interdependent cash sales should not alter that result. I would conclude therefore that a cash offer to other stockholders is enough even when the controlling stock- holder is given stock for his shares, provided the cash is equivalent to full fair value of the stock received by the controlling stock- holder.89 This discussion is only illustrative of the kinds of judgments to be made in complying with the rule of equal opportunity. Much more difficult questions will arise out of the fact that sales of controlling shares are often not straight cash sales or ex- changes of securities but involve other terms that cannot so easily be made equally applicable to other stockholders.90 Sup- pose, for example, that the selling stockholder gives warranties. It would surely be unfair to require a small minority stockholder to join in such a warranty without limitation. Can the minority stockholders be offered less for their shares on the ground that part of what the controlling stockholders receive is in considera- tion for their warranties? Or is it not better to achieve complete equality of treatment by putting a portion of every selling stock- holder's price in escrow to meet contingent liabilities? Without meaning to imply that the answers are easy, I would suggest that the test should be whether any particular discrimination in treatment between insiders and minority stockholders is some- thing that could be achieved lawfully in the setting of a corporate sale of assets. C. Remedies The one respect in which the decision in Perlman v. Feldmann is seriously deficient is that of the remedy sought and granted -an accounting for the amount of Feldmann's sale price that represented payment for the power to control allocation of the corporation's product. This remedy, derived from the corporate asset theory of control, required a lengthy trial, on remand, of 89Cf. Haverland v. Lane, 89 Wash. 557, I54 Pac. iii8 (I9I6). 90 See In re Caplan, 20 App. Div. 2d 30I, 246 N.Y.S.2d 9I3, aff'd mem., I4 N.Y. 2d 679, i98 N.E.2d 908, 249 N.Y.S.2d 877 (i964) (sale price partially conditional on future market price).</page><page sequence="47">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 55I the issue of what the Feldmann stock would have been worth "without the appurtenant control over the corporation's output of steel." 91 But more important, by paying minority stock- holders their share of the premium, without purchasing their shares, the remedy has the effect of dividing the stockholders into two classes: those who have paid (Wilport) and those who have been paid (Perlman et al.) for their share of the value of the corporate power in question.2 One of the great advantages of the rule of equal opportunity is that it presents the possibility of avoiding these problems by fashioning a better remedy in the nature of specific enforcement of the requirements of the rule itself. A minority stockholder not offered an opportunity to sell his shares at the same price as that received by the controlling stockholder could be given, by way of remedy, an opportunity to tender his shares and demand pay- ment of the same price as that received by the controlling stock- holder. This form of remedy would have the advantage of avoid- ing difficult and rather artificial valuation problems and of pre- serving equal status among stockholders, whoever they may be, after the remedy has been awarded. A number of questions remain in working out the details of such a remedy. Against whom should it be available, and for how long? For how many shares should the complaining stock- holder be entitled to receive payment? Is the matter an appro- priate one for a class action? What is the effect of an agreement between the buyer and seller of controlling shares by which either agrees to indemnify the other against any liability to minority stockholders resulting from the sale? I. - The questions for how many shares a complaining stock- holder can receive payment, and from whom, and the effect of an indemnification agreement, are closely interrelated and should be considered together. This is because the rule of equal op- portunity permits alternative modes of compliance. The rule would have been satisfied if the purchaser of the controlling block had offered to buy from all other stockholders at the same price. If a remedy were to be patterned chiefly after this mode of compliance, it would run primarily against the purchaser and would enable a complaining stockholder to tender and demand 91 2I9 F.2d at I78. 92 See p. 5I3 supra.</page><page sequence="48">552 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 payment for all his shares. On the other hand the rule could have been satisfied without the purchaser's offering to buy any more shares than he did, if the seller of controlling shares had offered other stockholders a chance to participate ratably in the sale. A remedy patterned after this mode of compliance would run primarily against the seller and would only entitle the plaintiff to receive payment for a proportional number of his shares. Following this pattern, the remedy should be granted in a class suit in which all eligible minority stockholders are notified and invited to tender their shares; the seller of controlling shares would then be compelled to take and pay for enough shares so that he and each tendering stockholder would end up holding the same fractional proportion of their holdings prior to the sale of controlling shares. I see no compelling reason why seller and purchaser should not both be liable to outside stockholders for a breach of the rule. It is within the power of either the seller or purchaser to compel compliance: they had to act together to violate the rule. Accordingly, whichever is primarily liable, the other party should be held secondarily liable if the first cannot be found. But who should be primarily liable? Which mode of compliance is to form the model for a remedy? Since the purchaser and seller acting together could have elected to satisfy the rule in either fashion, no reason is immediately apparent why they should not be permitted to choose between them as to the pattern for relief if liability is incurred for breach of the rule. This they can do by way of an indemnity agreement. Thus, if the seller agrees to indemnify the purchaser then the primary liability, if any is established, should run against the seller for a proportion- ate number of each complaining stockholder's shares. If the pur- chaser agrees to indemnify the seller, on the other hand, the primary remedy would lie against the purchaser for all of a complaining stockholder's shares. Note, however, what cannot be done by way of agreement be- tween the purchaser and seller. They cannot effectively agree that the remedy shall lie against the seller for only a part of each complainant's shares, but that the purchaser will then satisfy the seller's obligations. If this were permitted the effect of apply- ing the remedy would be to create a situation where the seller of controlling shares has still got rid of all his shares while other stockholders have sold only part of theirs, and this does not</page><page sequence="49">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 553 comply with the requirement of equal opportunity. In effect, an agreement by which the purchaser agrees to indemnify the seller against liability is part of the consideration offered for the seller's shares, and it must take a form that does not perpetuate the wrong as soon as it is carried out. In the absence of an agreement between the parties, who should be primarily liable, and for how much? Or should a complaining stockholder have a choice against whom to proceed? The more conservative answer is to grant a remedy primarily against the seller. This is more conservative both because it re- sults in a smaller measure of liability and because it is more in line with our nearest precedent, the Feldmann case. I would think a remedy primarily against the seller of controlling shares for a part only of each complainant's shares is the preferable choice. What ought to happen to the measure of liability when en- forcement is had against the party secondarily liable? Suppose the seller of controlling shares takes his price and runs. Is the purchaser's secondary liability only to do what the seller would have been obliged to do - to take and pay for a portion of each claimant's shares - or must he now, since the seller has suc- ceeded in disposing permanently of any interest in the corpora- tion, take all of a complainant's shares? If the purchaser has reason to expect a claim and acts in a manner that actively facilitates the seller's escape from liability, the effect is much the same as if there were an express agreement by the purchaser to assume liability. Therefore, as in the case of an express assump- tion of liability, the purchaser should be obliged to take and pay for all shares tendered. If, on the other hand, there is nothing to show that the purchaser was implicated in the seller's escape, it is perhaps enough to hold him to the liability the seller would have incurred or suffered. The problem may arise the other way around if there was an indemnity agreement. If the purchaser agreed to indemnify the seller, then his obligation would be to take and pay for all of a claimant's shares. But suppose the purchaser is unavailable or judgment-proof so that a claimant has to go against the seller: is the seller's obligation in this case to take and pay for all of a claimant's shares, as the purchaser would have to do if he were available and able, or only to take and pay for a part? Cannot the seller argue with considerable force that what has happened</page><page sequence="50">554 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 here is that the indemnity agreement has failed, and that this should do no more than put the seller back where he would have been without any indemnity agreement? 2. - For how long should a minority stockholder be able to proceed against either the seller or purchaser of controlling shares for a breach of the rule of equal opportunity? This ques- tion is, of course, a matter of considerable impact so long as we talk of a remedy in the form under discussion. In effect the remedy here gives a complainant a put covering some or all of his shares at a fixed price - that at which the controlling shares were sold. The length of time during which he can claim a remedy is the dura- tion of the put. Clearly the value of a put, and the burden it casts on the one who must honor it, are substantially increased as the duration of the put is lengthened. The answer to this question depends largely on the extent to which the remedy is intended to deter violations of the rule in the first place. Compliance with the rule requires only that out- side stockholders be given one chance to sell. The availability of any period during which minority shareholders can wait gives them an advantage as compared with the effect of initial compli- ance with the rule. For my own part I should think the primary purpose of a remedy here is simply to give the outside stock- holders their due, and that a relatively short period would satisfy this purpose. Even a short period will provide a considerable deterrent to violation of the rule. One vehicle for imposing a time limit is laches. Following the traditional statement of laches, a complainant will be barred unless he brings an action within a reasonable length of time after he learns, or should have learned, the facts on which it is based, if his delay would injure the defendant.93 This formula gives the necessary flexibility to take account of a variety of possible factors. A court may consider a shorter length of time reasonable if, for example, the parties to a sale of controlling shares have taken steps to bring all the facts to the immediate attention of outside stockholders, than if the information has only seeped out. A court can distinguish between a complainant who promptly demands payment for his shares, though he delays bringing suit, and one who forces the defendant to bear the risk of loss without the chance of gain, by saying nothing. A potential 93 2 POMEROY, EQUITY JURISPRUDENCE ? 4I9 (5th ed. Symons I941).</page><page sequence="51">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 555 defendant, on the other hand, ought to be able to cut the time quite short, at any time, by making an offer to purchase from out- side stockholders. Laches may not provide enough protection against market risks in some cases, because even if demand is made and suit is brought promptly, it may take time to determine whether the rule was violated. In a case of nonflagrant violation a court might therefore allow a defendant credit -presumably in the form of a reduction in the price at which he must purchase for any decline in value he can prove to have resulted from inter- vening factors not connected with the transfer of control.94 3. - Should an action to enforce the rule of equal opportunity be brought as a class action? And in any event when minority shares have been transferred, is the transferor or the transferee eligible to sue, or to share in a recovery, if some other shareholder is successful in maintaining a class action? It seems evident to me that relief ought to be awarded in a class action. The principal facts on which liability depends will be the same for each potential complaining stockholder so con- siderations of economy of judicial effort call for a class action. But more important, the very purpose of this rule is to assure equality of treatment, and that aim will be best served by award- ing relief in a class action. Indeed, practical considerations vir- tually require a class action when the defendant is the seller of controlling shares, since the measure of relief to each stockholder depends in part on how many seek relief. Moreover, corporate organization facilitates communication with all members of the class; and corporate stockholders already have the advantages and disadvantages of having litigation brought in their behalf by volunteer representatives in other contexts. The Feldmann case itself stands as a precedent in fact if not in name for the granting of relief in a class action. The choice between transferor and transferee of outside shares as eligible complainants is more difficult. It seems to me that most of the reasons that justify a transferee's indirect participation in the benefit of a recovery in a derivative suit will also justify permitting a transferee to participate in this situation. There is a good deal to commend the rule that one who purchases shares of stock acquires all the rights his seller had as a stockholder. 94 Cf. Securities Act of I933, ? ii(e), as amended, 48 Stat. 907 (I934), It U.S.C. ? 77k(e) (1958).</page><page sequence="52">556 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 A right to participate in relief under the rule of equal opportunity seems to me to be a right of a stockholder, even if it is not to be enforced by a derivative action in any traditional sense. More- over, if the remedy is to take the sole form of an opportunity to tender and receive payment for shares, then only the transferee of shares can utilize the remedy in any event. In the Feldmann case itself relief was awarded to the holders, at the time relief was granted, of all the shares outstanding on the date of Feld- mann's sale to Wilport except the shares that were the object of that sale.95 D. Related Questions Here I want to mention four questions concerning or related to a sale of controlling shares that are not directly covered by the rule, but on which the rule and its underlying reasons have some bearing. Two of these questions have been the subject of recent litigation. i. Validity of Director Elections and Contract Provisions Re- quiring Director Elections in Connection With a Transfer of Controlling Shares. - One recent case involved a seller of shares trying to avoid performance of a sale contract on the ground that the whole contract was void because of a provision requiring him to procure the resignation of the incumbent directors and the election, as their successors, of the purchaser's nominees.96 Another case involved an attack on the validity of an election, in a similar situation, after it was carried out.97 In both cases the shares sold were much less than a majority of the shares outstanding. The problem of contract clauses of this sort has been discussed and litigated over an extended period. It seems fairly well agreed that such a clause is valid and lawful if it appears as part of a contract for sale of a majority of a corporation's outstanding shares.98 If such a clause appeared, however, in a contract under which directors were selling insubstantial holdings at a significant premium over market value, it is generally assumed that a court would recognize the bribe.99 The problem concerns intermediate 95 154 F. Supp. at 446. 96 Essex Universal Corp. v. Yates, 305 F.2d 572 (2d Cir. i962). 9 In re Caplan, 20 App. Div. 2d 30I, 246 N.Y.S.2d 9I3, aff'd mem., I4 N.Y.2d 679, I98 N.E.2d 908, 249 N.Y.S.2d 877 (i964). 98 Essex Universal Corp. v.

REV. 986, 997-98 (I957).</page><page sequence="53">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 557 situations, and the tendency seems to be to hold that validity de- pends on whether the shares sold represented practical working control.'00 But this concept is not an easy one to apply. The rule of equal opportunity says nothing directly about the validity of such clauses, or of elections pursuant to such clauses, but acceptance of the rule would have some bearing on the prob- lem. I would be inclined to uphold such a clause, and the result- ing election, in any case where the rule of equal opportunity was complied with by an express offer, with adequate disclosure, to purchase shares from other stockholders. When a relatively small number of shares is transferred, it may seem unusual that they should carry control of the board of directors. But one cannot very practically compel the old directors to remain in office after selling their shares. And full compliance with the rule serves both to ensure that nothing in the price paid is a bribe and to give other stockholders a chance to get out if they wish. Under these circumstances there would seem to be no strong conflict of interest to prevent the old directors from exercising reasonable care in judging their successors' qualifica- tions. On the other hand, I would not conclude that the election is invalid whenever the rule is not complied with. When a clearly controlling block is sold I see little to be gained by unseating the purchaser's directors. None of the remedies proposed involves taking shares away from the purchaser, so he will succeed in electing his own directors in due course in any event. The ques- tion of what constitutes a controlling block will therefore remain to be determined in cases where the rule is not complied with, and someone attacks the validity of the election. 2. Disparate Treatment of Voting and Nonvoting Shares in a Recapitalization To Eliminate the Nonvoting Shares. - In a couple of cases since Feldmann, courts have approved recapitali- zations in which holders of voting common stock received more per share than did holders of otherwise identical nonvoting com- mon stock.'0' In both cases Feldmann was cited by complainants for the proposition that control was a corporate asset and was rejected by the court as a precedent for requiring equal treat- 100 Essex Universal Corp. v. Yates, 305 F.2d 572, 579 (2d Cir. I962). 101 Honigman v. Green Giant Co., 309 F.2d 667 (8th Cir. I962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 94I (I963); Manacher v. Reynolds, 39 Del. Ch. 40I, i65 A.2d 74I (Ch. 1960).</page><page sequence="54">558 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 ment. The equal opportunity rule provides a rationale for Feld- mann that is not inconsistent with the results in these cases. The problem of the relation of voting to nonvoting stock is a thorny one. Many of the reasons for the rule of equal oppor- tunity would seem to require that holders of nonvoting shares be given an equal opportunity to sell if the controlling insiders sell their voting stock. In particular, even within the context of a recapitalization rather than a sale to outsiders, the analogy to corporate action by way of sale of assets and subsequent liquida- tion would seem to call for equal treatment.'02 But the rule of equal opportunity presupposes fungible securities to be offered for sale. Voting and nonvoting stock are not fungible. And a voting stockholder does not enjoy his power of control by exercising it to bring about the recapitalization, as a controlling shareholder does when he brings about a sale to outsiders, because he gets nothing by way of change in investment from the transaction. Unless he is permitted some premium for relinquishing sole voting power, the owner of voting stock in a two-class situation would often have no reason to give it up. One may properly question whether the magnitude of the premium has not been too great in the cases where it has been allowed.'03 But I would not be inclined to insist on complete equality of treatment, as under the rule of equal opportunity, in the recapitalization situation. 3. A Sale of Controlling Shares Shortly After the Purchaser Has Acquired Other Shares for Less. -If a purchaser wishes to ac- quire all the stock of a corporation without paying everyone the same price per share as is demanded by the controlling stockholder for his shares, he may proceed by purchasing the minority shares first. If he has purchased all the minority shares before he con- cludes any agreement with the controlling stockholder, there is no violation of the rule of equal opportunity, since at no time does he make a purchase at a price not available to all stockholders. But should such a program result in liability? In point of fact a com- paratively large number of the litigated cases have involved varia- 102 Indeed, a corporate liquidation was involved (by way of merging into a subsidiary) in Manacher v. Reynolds; the recapitalization was a prelude to liquida- tion of a holding company. 103 In Manacher v. Reynolds the recapitalization alone was on a 3-to-I basis, making a 200% premium for voting power. But the control group had other shares in the enterprise and the net effect of the 3-to-I exchange was only to in- crease their participation in the surviving corporation from I4.2% to I7.4%.</page><page sequence="55">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 559 tions of this pattern, and several theories have been advanced and sometimes accepted as grounds for decision in this context. In particular, the theory of corporate action, based on the analogy to a sale of assets and subsequent liquidation, has been most often advanced with respect to cases involving contemporaneous pur- chase of all a corporation's shares.'04 There is one factor, however, that is not always identified in the opinions as crucial, but that may in fact be controlling. That is, in every case where relief has been awarded against a control- ling stockholder, on whatever theory, there was not an adequate disclosure to the minority stockholders of all that was going on.'05 The test of whether adequate disclosure is indeed the controlling stockholder's sole duty in this set of cases is to assume a situation clearly within the reach of one of the other theories. Assume a purchaser comes to the management of a steel corporation and offers to buy its plant for a specified price. The management, which holds a controlling block of stock, replies that the price is not high enough, names a higher price at which it will sell, and suggests that the purchaser may be able to buy out the minority at a lower price. The purchaser then offers a lower price to the minority stockholders, acquires their stock, and then purchases the manage- ment stock at the higher price. The net result is that management has sold at more than the specified price per share; the purchaser has acquired all the stock at an average equal to the specified price per share; and the outside stockholders have received less than the specified price per share for their stock. On any literal application of the corporate action doctrine the controlling stock- holder should be liable; the question is whether liability can be avoided if a complete disclosure is made to each minority stock- holder of the fact that the controlling stockholder is being offered a higher price. The fact that the minority stockholders, by selling with full knowledge of the facts, register their consent to the whole trans- action, is not alone a complete answer to the arguments for impos- ing liability. The issue is whether the controlling stockholder should be able to compel a minority stockholder to accept less than 104 See materials cited in note 40 supra. 105 See, e.g., Dunnett v. Arn, 7i F.2d 9I2 (ioth Cir. I934) (recovery granted only to stockholders who prove no knowledge of prior sale of controlling shares at higher price); Low v. Wheeler, 207 Cal. App. 2d 477, 24 Cal. Rptr. 538 (Dist. Ct. App. i962).</page><page sequence="56">560 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 his prorata share of the proceeds as a condition to being permitted to enjoy the benefits of any sale at all. To be more concrete, if the controlling stockholder is permitted to exact a higher price, even on the condition of full disclosure, the danger is that he will be encouraged to seek to do so. He may refuse an offer to purchase assets at a price he would otherwise have been delighted to receive, simply because he sees an opportunity to get even more at the ex- pense of his fellows; indeed the higher the offered price, the greater will be the pressure on the minority stockholders to accept a dis- count. Even if the purchaser's offered price is nearer a question- able level, the effect of permitting unequal realization may be to turn the controlling stockholder's negotiating efforts toward reduc- ing his fellow stockholders' selling price instead of raising the purchaser's offer. Another way of stating the problem is to note how difficult it is to formulate anything more than procedural protection in this area. Suppose we went beyond requiring full disclosure, and said a con- trolling stockholder cannot sell his shares for more than the minor- ity has been paid. If the minority, knowing everyone's position, was sufficiently anxious to sell out, it might organize the deal by purchasing from the controlling stockholder and reselling to the ultimate purchaser. Surely a rule whose sole purpose is to protect the minority should not be extended to prevent the minority from buying out the controlling shares. So in a sense the statement that a controlling stockholder cannot sell his shares for more than the minority has been paid or offered is still essentially procedural, permitting unequal realization but only if engineered, or insti- gated, or at least carried out, by the noncontrolling stockholders. The only rule that would completely outlaw unequal realization would be one by which the controlling stockholder could be compelled to sell (or consent to a corporate sale of assets that would equally liquidate his interest in the present business of the corporation) at a price determined without his consent.'06 But I have no stomach for that. If there is disagreement between stock- holders over a proposed item of corporate business, the normal rule provides for decision in accord with the will of the majority. Indeed, when the issue is whether or not to sell the corporate assets 106 Cf. Dravosburg Land Co. v. Scott, 340 Pa. 280, i6 A.2d 4I5 (I940) (direc- tor permitted to retain $40,000 received for parcel of land while corporation re- ceived $35,000 for larger adjacent parcel, where purchaser was only interested in the two parcels together).</page><page sequence="57">1965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 56I - to bring about a liquidation of all stockholders' interests in the present business - a direct stockholder vote is usually required and it is often more than a simple majority. We do not change the rule to permit the minority to force liquidation on the majority, except under most extreme circumstances. The problem is one of considerable difficulty. On the whole it seems to me to be the better course, at present at least, to permit unequal realization if there has been full disclosure to the minority stockholders who sell at a discount. 4. A Sale of Shares to a Purchaser Who Already Owns a Sub- stantial Stock Interest in the Corporation. -Throughout this article I have referred to a sale of controlling shares to an outsider - one who does not have any substantial stock interest in the corporation. Why has the statement of the rule been so limited, and should the limitation be retained? Application of the rule to a purchase by one who already holds a substantial number of shares would involve several differences in the situations to which the rule would apply. For one thing a very small block of shares might represent control when added to the holdings of an existing substantial stockholder. A sale of such shares ("swing shares") would not therefore bring about a shift in corporate control from seller to purchaser, but rather a shift from someone else to the purchaser, or from some kind of state of balance to the purchaser. Consider for example a case where A and B each own 40 per cent of the outstanding shares, C owns 15 per cent and D owns 5 per cent. If C sells his shares to A control will thereby come into A's hands; but it does not shift to A from C. Furthermore, in a situation of this sort, payment of a premium price is apt to result from a contest for control. That is, C is apt to get the highest price for his shares if A and B are both seeking to buy from him. This happens frequently, of course, in proxy contests where both sides seek to buy shares as well as to solicit votes from existing stockholders. If the rule of equal opportunity were applied to purchases by an existing stockholder, it would of course apply to sales of swing shares as well as sales of controlling shares. Hence, in the hypo- thetical given above, the rule would apply to C, and C would not be free to sell to A unless D, at least, was offered an equal price for his shares - or for part of them, if C, too, sold only part. But what about B? Must an offer also be made to B at the same price? What if B has himself been seeking to buy from C? If A is re-</page><page sequence="58">562 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:505 quired to make his offers for C's shares open to B on some basis - and vice versa - questions of timing become both crucial and quite complex. The substantive reason for excluding sales to insiders, how- ever, does not relate to these complexities, but to the calculus of reasons for paying a premium for control set forth above.107 There it was argued that none of the reasons why an outsider would pay substantially more per share for controlling shares than for supercontrol shares was such as to warrant any strong objection to a rule that would prohibit such discrimination. Part of the argument was that the investment-protective function of control would explain a substantial differential between what a person would pay for controlling shares and for noncontrolling shares but not between controlling shares and supercontrol shares. That part of the argument will not hold when the purchaser already owns a substantial number of shares, since one reason he may have to pay a premium for controlling shares (or swing shares) is to protect the investment he already has in the corporation - and that reason will not enter into his appraisal of additional shares beyond those needed to secure control. Consider again the hypothetical situation in which A and B each own 40 shares, C owns 15, and D owns 5; and A and B are at odds, each seeking to buy C's shares. Suppose A appraises his invest- ment at $ioo per share if he is in control and $90 if B is in control, a modest and wholly reasonable kind of differential. How much then would he rationally be willing to pay for C's shares? If B buys them, A will have 40 shares worth $90 per share, or a total investment worth $3,600. If A buys them he will have a total in- vestment of 55 shares worth $ioo per share, or a total investment worth $5,500. The difference, $I,900, is presumably what he can rationally afford to pay C. That makes a price per share of $I26.67, which is $26.67 more than the $ioo investment appraisal on which it is based, and which presumably reflects the top price he would be willing to pay D or B for more shares once he has gained control. This differential of $26.67 is here wholly explained in terms of investment appraisals without tending to indicate, as in the case of a sale to an outsider, any expectation of extraneous return. But is this purpose - the purpose to protect an existing invest- 107 See pp. 522-37 supra.</page><page sequence="59">i965] STOCKHOLDER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 563 ment by gaining or strengthening a position of control -one that justifies the creation of inequalities in market opportunity? The spectacle of a I5 per cent stockholder extracting a price wholly out of line with any rational appraisal of his own shares standing alone is not a pleasant one. Note that the price per share he may extract (or extort?) tends to vary inversely with the number of shares he holds, so long as it remains enough to give a purchaser control. Eleven shares, when A and B each own 40, would sell for more per share than I 5. The case of a contest for control among existing stockholders presents its own affirmative reasons, therefore, for insisting on an open auction. Reluctantly I must confess, however, that there is strong au- thority - though only by way of analogy - for recognition of an interest in protecting an existing investment as sufficient to justify unequal treatment of stockholders in the matter of selling their stock. I refer to the series of recent Delaware cases permitting a corporation to buy out a particular dissident stockholder at a price not offered to others, when the management believes in good faith that this is in the best interest of the corporation.'08 Cer- tainly, if an unequal offer to purchase out of corporate funds is permitted, it is hard to believe an unequal offer by the management to purchase out of personal funds would be proscribed. For my own part I find these Delaware cases disturbing. Given a clean slate, I would want to reexamine their results and then go on to inquire whether an open auction would not be a fair and useful device for dealing with intracorporate contests for control. But the considerations are sufficiently different from those in- volved in a sale to an outsider to make that another subject for another day. 108 Cheff v.
