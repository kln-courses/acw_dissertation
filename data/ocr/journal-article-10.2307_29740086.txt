<plain_text><page sequence="1">Inframundo: Juan Rulfo's Photographic Companion to El llano en llamas Howard M. Fraser College of William and Mary How do readers perceive literature, given the intricate linguistic process of encoding and decoding that occurs once the author places words on the printed page? It is evident that much of the "meaning" of this process, the affective value of literature, depends in large part on the visual interpretation of images and linguistic symbols. Especially during the past century, the advent of photography and cinema has served to expand the repertoire of visual stimuli in literature as well as to educate readers in the literary values of the visual media. We need only to consider the wealth of critical terms derived from the visual arts such as point of view, focus, flashback, and montage among others, to begin to appreciate the interrelationships of art forms. In this regard, numerous literary works seem to have been written to be viewed as well as to be read. Altamirano's novel, El Zarco (1888), illustrates the romantic treatment of violence and the search for justice in nineteenth-century Mexico with visual contrasts between light and darkness symbolizing the eternal struggle between good and evil. This treatment is so telling that it has inspired a series of splendid woodcuts that portray the 56</page><page sequence="2">Howard M. Fraser 57 richness of visual imagery and exoticism of the original text.i Azuela's Los de abajo (1915) is a series of vignettes of the Mexican Revolution with a vivid sense of photographic or even cinematographic framing and pacing.2 And Fuentes's La muerte de Artemio Cruz is a novelistic reworking of the film classic, "Citizen Kane," complete with filmic techniques and entire scenes adapted to fiction.3 When writers and photographers combine forces to document the world from their two perspectives, we as readers doubly profit from the experience, thanks to the illustration of the verbal images in photographs, and the captions for the illustrations in the written text. For example, the classic Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, the volume that James Agee and Walker Evans coauthored for the Farm Security Administration in the early forties, exposed in images and text the plight of sharecroppers during the Great Depression. In like fashion, when a single individual undertakes an expos?e in both photographs and text, it is a most fortuitous event. Such is the case of the Mexican novelist and photographer Juan Rulfo, whose Inframundo and El llano en llamas can be viewed as complementary manifestations of a single reality, that of rural Mexico at midcentury. In this study, I will show how the images of Mexico contained in Inframundo reveal the background of Rulfo's homeland and how they underly the visual qualities of his short-story collection, El llano en llamas. Inframundo* is a mass-produced edition of a commemorative volume entitled Juan Rulfo, homenaje nacional originally brought out by the Instituto de Bellas Artes in 1980. Although conceived as an homage to Rulfo the writer of fiction, the book most likely will be prized as a showcase of the author's photographic talent that is only now being recognized on the Mexican cultural scene. According to Luis Leal, photography was a lifetime hobby that "resulted in the publication of some photographs in magazines" and a series of photographs published in Rulfo's last book, El gallo de oro.5 One hundred photographs appear in Juan Rulfo, homenaje nacional, and Ediciones del Norte has republished most of these in both Spanish and English editions of Inframundo. In scenes of Jalisco, his birthplace and setting of his fiction, Rulfo's lens reveals "un M?xico inquietante ... el drama de su Jalisco y de la pobreza. "6 Although they were all taken during the decade and a half preceding the appearance of his two masterpieces, Pedro P?ramo (1955) and El llano en llamas (1953), the photographs published in Inframundo have not been arranged chronologically. The editors, nonetheless, juxtapose various sequences that carry out similar ideas, and for the purposes of this "exhibition" of Rulfo's works, I have chosen to present three principal thematic areas in Rulfo's photographic vision of Mexico: Structures; Landscapes; and Portraits. It should be noted that Rulfo's work here is not staged or posed in any sense. He eschews topical groupings and captions 1 Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, El Zarco the Bandit, tr. Mary Allt, wood engravings by Zelma Blakely (London: Folio Society, 1957). This edition depicts seven scenes from the novel. 2 For their brevity and visual precision, many scenes from Azuela's novel can be considered snapshots taken of the Revolution. Orlando G?mez Gil has remarked on the pictorial, photographic and even cinematographic quality of this classic in his Historia cr?tica de la literatura hispanoamericana (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1968), p. 597: "Permite que los personajes se vayan pintando a s? mismos con su actuaci?n. La galer?a de personajes parece arrancada a la realidad. La t?cnica novel?stica debe mucho a Zola en el determinismo y en la maestr?a para pintar el movimiento de las masas. La acci?n es r?pida, breve como en cinta cinematogr?fica." 3 Lanin A. Gyurko, "La muerte de Artemio Cruz and Citizen Kane: A Comparative Analysis," Carlos Fuentes: A Critical View, ed.

Fernando Ben?tez, "Conversaciones con Juan Rulfo," notes the relationship between Rulfo's photographic work and his fiction: "Cuando recorr?a el pa?s en otros a?os, le gustaba la fotograf?a. Sus fotos ? que hoy se publican ?, retienen el misterio de Pedro P?ramo o de El llano en llamas; mujeres enlutadas, campesinos, indios, ruinas, cielos borrascosos, campos resecos. Una poes?a de la desolaci?n y una humanidad concreta, expresa un mundo que est? m?s all? del paisaje y de sus gentes, construido en blanco y negro, con gran econom?a y nobleza. Lo que su ojo ve?a el escritor lo llevaba a las letras." (p. 4) 5 Luis Leal, Juan Rulfo (Boston: G.K.

Revista de literatura latinoamericana</page><page sequence="3">58 Inframundo: Juan Rulfo's Photographic Companion to El llano en llamas as a clue to his pictures' power and meaning, but rather he seeks the precise visual image and frequently the photographic moment that gives definition to Mexico and its people. STRUCTURES Inframundo opens with a series of photographs of buildings in ashes. These striking views (# ii, [3, "El incendio de Actip?n"]; # iii, [2, "Ex-hacienda de Actip?n]; # i)7 are appropriate depictions of the setting for El llano en llamas. The smoke emanating from the stately buildings indicates that there is a potentially violent story to be told here, something cataclysmic that has interrupted the order of things. The power of events has a life of its own as in photo # ii. Here, the flames of the llano and clouds of smoke dwarf the structure, and the aftermath of the catastrophe in # iii indicates the indifference of the natural surroundings to tragedy in its midst. Throughout this collection, Rulfo shows a profound fascination with old buildings, structures torn either by disaster as in photo # i or by time itself as in # v and # xxxviii. His sense of contrast is wonderfully displayed in # v as he focuses on a doorway and wall whose original function, to protect the house from the elements, is now lost. Light streams through the door and open roof and illuminates the rough texture of the adobe blocks and the weathered boards around the doorway showing how the divisions between inside and out, land and man-made structure, has been erased. One photograph (# lx) reveals the blurring of distinctions between the natural and man-made as a building's fa?ade displays an anthropomorphic quality of a human face. Crumbling structures are present in his fiction and underscore man's unrelenting struggle for survival against the elements and the sheer indifference of time itself. Reflecting this imagery of decay, one of Rulfo's stories depicts the disintegration of structures as a metaphor of the crumbling of institutions and of an entire way of life is "Luvina." In the story, as he prepares to spend his first night in the remote village of Luvina, the narrator selects a place for his family to sleep, a church in ruins:8 Aquella noche nos acomodamos para dormir en un rinc?n de la iglesia, detr?s del altar desmantelado. Hasta all? llegaba el viento aunque un poco menos fuerte. Lo estuvimos oyendo pasar por encima de nosotros, con sus largos aullidos; lo estuvimos oyendo entrar y salir por los huecos socavones de las puertas: golpeando con sus manos de aire las cruces del viacrucis: unas cruces grandes y duras hechas con palo de mezquite que colgaban de las paredes a todo lo largo de la iglesia, amarradas con alambres que rechinaban a cada sacudida del vento como si fuera un rechinar de dientes, (p. 90) In several of Rulfo's photos of buildings in decay, the land seems to reclaim territory taken from it, as once-human structures dissolve into the earth. Such is the case in # xxxiii [30, "Nicho de Atlihuetz?n, Tlax."], # viii [74, "Bardas tiradas a la calle"], and # liv [51, "Pecho de Angel"] in which the buildings crumble revealing how the wind has worked away at the walls and shape of the structure, and plant life slowly invades the man-made space as nature reclaims it. 7 There are significant differences between the Ediciones del Norte volume, Inframundo, and the Instituto de Bellas Artes compilation of photos entitled Juan Rulfo, homenaje nacional (M?xico, 1980) from which Inframundo is derived. Because photographs are entitled and unpaginated in Inframundo, references to them will be designated with small-case Roman numerals. However, whenever the pictures in Inframundo reproduce those in Juan Rulfo, homenaje nacional, the pagination and title from the Bellas Artes edition will accompany the Inframundo reference in brackets as in the first citation above, ii [3, "El incendio de Actip?n"]. Several photos are also reproduced in a section at the end of this article. This is indicated by a boldface Inframundo reference: # i. 8 All citations from El llano en llamas refer to the edition prepared by Hugo Rodriguez-Alcal? and Ray A. Verzasconi, (Enelewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. 1973). Chasqui ? Revista de literatura latinoamericana</page><page sequence="4">Howard M. Fraser 59 LANDSCAPE In Inframundo Rulfo expresses an adoration of the monumental in nature from lush forests (# xii, # xiv), and waterfalls (# xiii [18, "Cascada de Tulantango"]), to the high desert (# lxxxvii). In addition to these vistas depicting the breadth and depth of Mexico's landscape, Rulfo's photographs frequently express an interest in the angular and abstract, highlighting the resemblance between solid, man-made structures and natural forms. Note the interplay of light and dark in this view of a pyramid (# lxxii [23, "Pir?mide de Tenayuca, M?x."], and the juxtaposition of the massive indigenous structure (# vii) that seems to mimic the enormity and stability of a mountain (# vi [16, "Nevado de Colima"]). Much in the way Georgia O'Keefe's paintings depict the flatness of the New Mexican desert and the abstract quality of the objects found there, Rulfo can project a flat, abstract vision of the earth, as in his bird's-eye view of a mountain range with the barrenness of a lunar landscape (# xix [17, "Nevado de Tolum"]. Perhaps due to the aridity of his native region, Rulfo depicts the starkness of flora in his landscapes. Plants are cast in an almost pathetic, reverential pose, such as in the photograph of groping thistles rising from the desert floor (# xviii), a silhouette later mirrored in the skeletal profiles of dead trees (# lxviii [13, "Tiempo de verano"]; # lxx [12, "Tiempo de sequ?a"]). This view of the earth recurs in Rulfo's stories, as the theme of death is reflected in the landscape, such as the arid setting of "No oyes ladrar los perros" in which a man carries his dying son across the Jalisco desert and in "El hombre," a tale of revenge, in which a man pursues the murderer of his family through the angular landscape of skeletal trees: "El cielo estaba tranquilo all? arriba, quieto, trasluciendo sus nubes entre la silueta de los palos guajes, sin hojas. No era tiempo de hojas. Era ese tiempo seco y ro?oso de espinas y de espigas secas y silvestres." (p. 42) This hardness and unyielding texture of the land is frequently the cause of human tragedy such as in "Nos han dado la tierra." Campesinos trek across the desert to receive the piece of property guaranteed by land reform. But the story presents an ironic reversal of fate as their "promised land" becomes a hell on earth. This land is as hard as tepetate, cow's hide. The men's first glance at their territory sums up the inadequacy of the land to sustain life: "No, el llano no es cosa que sirva. No hay ni conejos ni p?jaros. No hay nada. A no ser unos cuantos huizaches trespeleques y una que otra manchita de zacate con las hojas enroscadas; a no ser eso, no hay nada." (p. 24) Multiple tragedies have a common stimulus in the infertility of the land in "Dues que no me maten." Because his fields are too parched for grazing, a farmer breaks through a fence and neglects to secure permission for his livestock to pasture on a neighbor's field. The offended neighbor kills a steer, which results in his own death in retribution for the slaughter. The story ends with a poetic justice that recalls the problem of parched land at the story's outset. The murderer, who has been on the run from his victim's family for over thirty years, has become a reclusive farmer who finally manages to till the soil and begin to grow corn. However, he unwittingly reveals his hideaway to his pursuers when they walk through his nascent cornfield and he unsuccessfully tries to scare them off. The tragedy that started with the hardness of the earth comes full circle as a kind of curse that follows the murderer: "Qui?n le iba a decir que volver?a aquel asunto tan viejo, tan rancio, tan enterrado como cre?a que estaba. Aquel asunto de cuando tuvo que matar a don Lupe." (p. 80) Notwithstanding the suggestions of mortality in Rulfo's landscape, his stark visions of the land are frequently counterbalanced by a sense of life rising from the most inhospitable surroundings such as the view of cacti flourishing in # xxi and the row of succulents that have the vital force of a military regiment in # Ixi [10, "Calle de Mitlas, Oax."]. Such a treatment serves as an introduction to Rulfo's belief, manifested in his portraits, that nature is redeemable, even from the harshest torments. Chasqui ? Revista de literatura latinoamericana</page><page sequence="5">60 Inframundo: Juan Rulfo's Photographic Companion to El llano en llamas PORTRAITS A recurring quality in Rulfo's portraits is an obliqueness of the pose, the indirect glance that reveals subjects, intent in their observation of events and oblivious to the camera (# lxxvi [40, "Desde el dintel de la puerta"]; # xxxi). Most of Rulfo's subjects seek anonimity in crowds (# xxvi), solitude (# lxxv, [42, "Desamparo"]), work (# lxvii [58, "Valle de Mezquital, Hgo."]; # lxix [63, "Mercado en Zacatepec, Oax."]) and their own clothing (# xl), thus reinforcing Octavio Paz's characterization of the Mexican reality as a masked one (# lxxxiii [80, "Todos para el S?bado de Gloria"]; # lxxxii [36, "Danza de moros y cristianos"]). However, there may be reasons for this masked quality that go beyond the Mexican's self-effacement discussed in El laberinto de la soledad. Rulfo's subjects are suspicious of the camera. They are curious but innocent observers of the photographer's observing them. (# lxxiii [71, "Ni?a ind?gena de El Chisme, Mixes Oax."]; # lxix [64, "Ind?gena de Totontepec, Mixes Oax."]; # xliii [69 "Anciana de Apan, Hgo."]; # lxxi ["Ind?gena de Cotzoc?n, Oax."]) His subjects are also self-conscious and distrust the photographer. These people want neither to be commercialized nor capitalized upon. They refuse to be transformed into a commodity. Their distrust recalls "Luvina" in which newcomers are not accepted into the bosom of the town until they have proved themselves worthy of trust. And this trust may take years to establish, if it is ever established at all. In a sense, the anonimity of Rulfo's subjects may be compared to that of the men, women and children from Walker Evans's and Dorothea Lange's photographs of sharecroppers taken during the Great Depression. But the Mexican's film reveals quite a different reality than the Americans'. While it can be said that Rulfo's subjects, like the inhabitants of the North American Dustbowl, are the poor, disenfranchised, holders of the worthless land, Rulfo's farmers, display a distrust of the camera unlike the Oakies in Evans and Lange. These characters from "Nos han dado la tierra," brought to life by Rulfo's art, merely acknowledge the presence of the camera without feeling the same complicity, the baring of their abject poverty to the photographer in the Walker Evans's classic Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. Rulfo's subjects attempt to create distance between themselves and the photographer in order to establish a dialectic between themselves as free individuals versus the photographer as their captor. They assert a dignity in their poverty and do not evoke raw pathos in their viewers. Some of Rulfo's most effective photos are of campesinos pausing in their daily work as they set the stage for their life's story (i.e. the barber in # lvii). There is an oral quality to Rulfo's subjects, reminiscent of the colloquial tone of titles from El llano en llamas, that the narrators deliver with a shrug of their shoulders: "Es que somos muy pobres," and "Nos han dado la tierra." The subject of # xvii [5, "Quedar? alguna esperanza"] draws strength from the desolation around him like the narrator of "Macario," who motionlessly waits for frogs to cross his path: "Ahora estoy junto a la alcantarilla esperando a que salgan las ranas. Y no ha salido ninguna en todo este rato que llevo platicando. Si tardan m?s en salir, puede suceder que me duerma, y luego ya no habr? modo de matarlas, y a mi madrina no le llegar? por ning?n lado el sue?o si las oye cantar, y se llenar? de coraje." (p. 22) The campesino in # xx [6, "En la tierra zapoteca"] contemplates the shabby land where he scratches out a living and can be considered a depiction of the narrator of "Nos han dado la tierra" who surveys his brittle soil: "No decimos lo que pensamos. Hace ya tiempo que se nos acabaron las ganas de hablar. Se nos acabaron con el calor. Uno platicar?a muy a gusto en otra parte, pero aqu? cuesta trabajo. Uno platica aqu? y las palabras se calientan en la boca con el calor de afuera, y se la resecan a uno en la lengua hasta que acaban con el resuello." (pp. 23-4) But for all their commonalities, Rulfo's fiction and photography do not complement each other perfectly. Perhaps better than his stories, which frequently end on a note of despair, Rulfo's photographs outline the theme of hope in the betterment of the human condition. The series of photographs of women tilling the fields (# xxii - xxv) for Chasqui ? Revista de literatura latinoamericana</page><page sequence="6">Howard M. Fraser 61 example, portrays the dignity of the poor and of their work and, ultimately, their pride. And so it is with the series of pictures of peasant musicians (# lxxvii - lxxx) that Rulfo included in his book El gallo de oro y otros textos para cine.9 Dated 1955, and shot in Oaxaca, they are reminiscent of the scenes in the Luis Bu?uePs film Los olvidados, which was shot during the same time as these photographs, that depicts a blind drummer who ekes out a living at the edge of the city peopled by an inappreciative and uncomprehending mob of dispossessed youths. In Rulfo's photographs, the musicians evoke the pathos of those trying to preserve culture on the fringes of civilization that is at the same time the frontier of a cultural desert. They must deal not only with their own poverty but also with the indifference of their sparse or nonexistent audience. What these musicians reveal to us is the value their preservation of culture holds for themselves if for no one else. They also show, like the guitarist in # Ixii, their contentment and sense of redemption in art through their dignity, solitude, and humility. And it is remarkable that salvation appears most often in his photographs, principally through the iconographie symbol of the cross. Although we might think that Rulfo focuses on death in his numerous pictures of graves, and on the degradation of humanity in his fiction, I feel that his interest in taking pictures of tombs belies the hope of resurrection or redemption through art, an interest that he reveals in several of his images. If we examine his photographs of crosses, we see a search for uncommon forms that can reveal an aesthetic sense that, in turn, displays a redeeming purpose to death. For example, # xlvii projects a most compelling contrast between the bright, light, almost filigree pattern of the wrought iron cross and death that anchors this almost playful structure to the earth. The highly ornamental crosses (# xxvii; # xlii [31, "Cruz de Tepeapulco, Hgo."]; # xxxix) and the grave sprouting lillies (# xlviii, similar to [34, "Alcatraces"]) give a sense of a life force operating through the stimulus of death. Not only a life force but a narrative force seems to operate in his photographs as well. Perhaps his most interesting narrative potential is in his photograph of three crosses atop a tomb (# xxxv [35, "Pante?n de Huamantla, Tlax."]). The setting, a precipice where graves have been placed, shows the harshness of the conditions that man lives by and the commanding natural beauty chosen for his burial. The sublime mixed with the commonplace is asserted in the composition of the crosses themselves. They are either tablelcgs, chair legs, or even a disassembled bedpost, common objects with which the deceased came in daily contact. The number of crosses suggests additional elements of a story yet to be told. Multiple graves can signify multiple deaths. The viewer ponders the implications of the possibilities in the common demise of a family in a massacre such as that in "El hombre," or of a struggle to the death in "La cuesta de las comadres." How Rulfo's graphic production should focus on the redemptive possibilities of life when his stories so frequently emphasize the tragic may be visualized in a sequence of photographs of stairways and clothes hung out to dry in Inframundo. Here, (# xlix, # 1, # li), the simplest of materials, wet clothes hanging in the sunny patio, symbolize cleansing and purification. It is perhaps the brilliant presence of light that inevitably allows us to interpret this work as a Dantesque ascent from the infernal elements of earthly existence, especially in # xlix. Rulfo deals with the theme of salvation, or more correctly the damnation of humanity, through lack of the most common necessities in various stories. In "Es que somos muy pobres," the family cow is washed away in a flood. From this simple event flow catastrophic consequences such as the loss of the dowry the cow represents, the impossibility of marriage, and the probable descent into prostitution of the young woman who, lacking a dowry, is now unacceptable as a mate. Salvation from torment is assured in the toads Macario must destroy in order to avoid the wrath of his madrina. And in "Diles que no me maten," although the murderer is not spared the death sentence, the executioner 9 Presentaci?n y notas de Jorge Ayala Blanco, (M?xico: Ediciones Era, 1980). Four photos in the series entitled "Los m?sicos" appear between pages 56-7. Three of these (# lxxviii, lxxix, lxxx) are reprinted in Inframundo. Chasqui ? Revista de literatura latinoamericana</page><page sequence="7">62 Inframundo: Juan Rulfo's Photographie Companion to El llano en llamas gives a rare demonstration of charity when he orders doses of chicha to lessen the pain of the firing squad. In conclusion, the photography of Juan Rulfo should be viewed in two contexts: as a photographic companion to his fiction as well as a document of mid-twentieth-century Mexico. As an illustration of stories from El llano en llamas, the graphic art of Inframundo provides a visual realization of the themes in his short stories that, in turn, can now serve as captions to the photographs. His pictures, stark, visual statements about contemporary Mexico, serve as excellent illustrations of the author's literary settings, characters and themes. In addition, as a documentary photographer, Rulfo joins the ranks of such masters of the genre as Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange. Rulfo captures the essence of the downtrodden, their innate dignity and pride, and he does so with a spirit of respect and curiosity in revealing their stories. The aesthetic value of Rulfo's work, then, lies in rendering visual images of his subjects and in revealing the narrative force of their underlying reality. In response to viewing his work, we as readers and spectators resemble the subjects in # lix: we are intrigued with deeper reality that lies beyond the frame on the page. And with Rulfo's aesthetic guidance in graphic and literary form, we have entr?e to this world. Chasqui ? Revista de literatura latinoamericana</page><page sequence="8">Howard M. Fraser 63 Chasqui ?
