<plain_text><page sequence="1">BLOOD AND SOIL IN ANNE MICHAELS'S FUGITIVE PIECES',I THE PASTORAL IN HOLOCAUST LITERATURE Donna Coffey The Nazi appropriation of Romanticism, pastoralism, and nature itself has constricted the poetic idiom available to the post-Holocaust writer. A key piece of Nazi ideology was the imagined connection between the Aryan race and the fields and forests of Germany, in contrast to the Nazi characterization of the urban and nomadic Jew who was severed from any connection to the land. Nineteenth-century Romantic writers drew on the pastoral tradition in their evocation of the innocence and purity of a folk at one with nature, and such idealized images of land and folk underlay the Nazi cult of Blut und Boden, blood and soil. The nostalgic images of rural life evoked in Nazi mythos are closely associated in literature with the tradition of the pastoral, a type of poetry rooted in ancient Greek depictions of shepherds living in harmony with nature in an ahistoricized golden age, and with its sister genre, the elegy. J. Clifton Spargo writes that the "the pastoral scene stands for a European tradition of poetry that had fostered the relationship between the land and the people only to be suddenly, perhaps permanently, interrupted by violence" and that "pastoral is a hypothesis of continuity, whether national, natural, or poetic, that quite possibly cannot survive the things done in its name or on its Ifo &lt; L MFS Modern Fiction Studies,Volume 53 number I, Spring 2007.

BLOOD AND SOIL IN ANNE MICHAELS'S FUGITIVE PIECESI I THE PASTORAL IN HOLOCAUST LITERATURE Donna Coffey</page><page sequence="2">28 Blood and Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces places" (225-26). Thus, if literature of the Holocaust engages with the pastoral at all, it tends to be anti-pastoral and mock-pastoral. Spargo, for instance, discusses the "mock-pastoral logic" of Randall Jarrell's poem "A Camp in the Prussian Forest" (227), arguing that the poem rejects a "pastoral bad conscience" that is predicated on the pastoral's "intention to maintain innocence against the hard fact[s]" of historical events, including genocide (231). However, in her novel Fugitive Pieces, Anne Michaels attempts to reinvent the pastoral in a way that forces it into collision with the events of the Holocaust. Her book reexamines the problematic re lationships between poetry and the Holocaust and between nature and the Holocaust. Rather than using pastoral motifs to create an imaginary golden world, Michaels creates a traumatic pastoral in which both nature and humans are victims and witnesses of catas trophe. She also seeks to redefine the terms of elegy, expanding it to the scope of a novel and altering it to accommodate the trauma of the Holocaust. Michaels is a Jewish Canadian author whose father emigrated from Russia after the Second World War. As one who is neither a survivor nor the child of a survivor (although her father's experiences during the Second World War are not known, and he was a Jewish emigrant who fled the wreckage of the war), Michaels is a latecomer to the tradition of Holocaust literature. She was best known for her poetry before the publication of Fugitive Pieces in 1996, and the novel blurs the boundaries between poetry and fiction. It has generated controversy because of the way that it aestheticizes the Shoah. Meira Cook argues, for instance, that the novel runs the risk of "unwittingly concealing] the decidedly unpoetic nature of genocide" through its "habitual mode of high lyricism" (16). Yet Susan Gubar argues that Fugitive Pieces is "a retort to Theodor Adorno's famous injunction" that to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric, and that the novel insists that "it is barbaric not to write and read literature" after the Holocaust (251). Gubar argues that the various empathie identifica tions in the novel model the ways in which "post-Holocaust proxy witnessing will attempt to keep memory of the Shoah alive during a period (soon to come) when there will be no survivors to attest for themselves" (271). The long first section of the novel is narrated by the poet Ja kob Beer, and the much shorter final section is narrated by Ben, an admirer of Jakob who retrieves his lost notebooks from Greece after Jakob's death. The second section, then, narrates the discovery of the first section. Jakob is a Polish Jew who was a young boy when his family was murdered by the Nazis. He survived by hiding in a wall and was rescued by a Greek geologist, Athos, who found him</page><page sequence="3">Coffey 29 while digging in the ruins of Biskupin. Athos raises Jakob as his own son, first in hiding on the Greek island of Zakynthos during the Nazi occupation of Greece, and then in Toronto, Canada, where he takes a university appointment. Athos is a "lyric geologist]" (209) whose poetic interpretations of geology, archaeology, and history shape Jakob's consciousness. Jakob becomes a writer who is plagued with grief and loneliness until, at the age of sixty, he meets and marries a younger woman named Michaela, with whom he lives in great happi ness in Athos's ancestral home on a Greek island. A prologue to the story explains that Jakob and Michaela were struck by a car in Athens and killed, while Ben's narration at the end of the novel reveals that Michaela was pregnant at the time of her death. The second narrator, Ben, is also a writer. His books on weather and biography and weather and war reflect an interest in natural di saster. He lives in Toronto and is the son of two Holocaust survivors who never talked about the past; Ben's marriage to his wife Naomi is threatened by his emotional disconnect from his parents and his jealousy of Naomi's closeness to them. Naomi's preoccupation with lullabies is painfully ironic as she herself remains childless. When Ben discovers after his parents' death that he had two older siblings who died in the Holocaust and that his mother had shared this story with Naomi but not with him, he separates from Naomi and goes to the Greek island of Idhra to search for the missing notebooks of Jakob Beer, whom he had met briefly and whose work he admired. Ben's narration is filled with quotations from Jakob's poetry. While having an affair with a woman named Petra in Greece, Ben discovers Jakob's notebooks and returns to Canada with the hope of reconcil ing with Naomi. The novel's title skillfully evokes several of the novel's major motifs. It points to the fragmentation present in the novel's lyrical, digressive, and dialogic structure. It evokes Petrarch's title Rime sparse, scattered rhymes, for his collection of poems, largely ele gies, to his beloved Laura. In the context of the elegy, it evokes the practice of spargamos, or tearing an animal to pieces, in the festival of the vegetation god Dionysus. Yet while Dionysus is supposed, like all vegetation gods, to be resurrected whole, Jakob's and Ben's dis membered family members and families can never be made whole again. The title also evokes the musical pieces performed or listened to by Bella, by Ben's father, and by Naomi. Indeed, Neal Bruss refers to the novel as a set of "fugal variations" (23), and the word "fugue" is contained in the word "fugitive," one a flight of beauty and the other a flight of fear. Paul Celan's famous Holocaust poem "Death Fugue" may also lurk in the background, and, indeed, Celan's poem also juxtaposes the "golden" ideal of German mythos with the reality of Jews forced to dig graves for themselves (63).</page><page sequence="4">30 Blood arid Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces "Pieces" also evokes archaeology and the discovery of frag ments of a people or culture. In the novel archaeology becomes a metaphor for the retrieval of history and of what has been hidden and buried. Athos, of course, is the primary source of archaeological metaphors in the novel. He discovers Jakob while digging for artifacts in Biskupin. Athos's discovery of Jakob parallels Ben's discovery of Jakob's notebooks, which the preface to the novel contextualizes as one of the "countless manuscripts" of Holocaust memory that were "deliberately hidden—buried in back gardens, tucked into walls and under floors—by those who did not live to retrieve them" (1). Jakob's notebooks must be "excavate[d]" by Ben as "archaeologist" (261). "Pieces" also points to Ben's other archaeological project, the retrieval of broken pieces of pottery along the banks of the Humber River, which many years earlier had flooded and destroyed his parents' home. The broken pottery seems to be an allusion to Czeslaw Milosz's poem "Song on Porcelain," in which Milosz uses images of pieces of porcelain by a river to suggest both the shattered possessions of Holocaust victims and the death of the pastoral tradition commonly portrayed on porcelain: "The masters' precious dream / Of roses, of mowers raking, / And shepherds on the lawn" (83). Michaels seems to deliberately allude to Milosz's poem as Ben describes collecting "broken dishes" and "china shards, small as mosaic tiles" (253), "a dinner plate—perhaps with the familiar and ever-popular blue willow pattern—stickfing] out of the bank horizontally like a shelf" (202). The "blue willow pattern" echoes Milosz's vision of a shattered pastoral and suggests that Michaels is self-conscious in her task of revising the pastoral in literature of the Holocaust. Fugitive Pieces raises many of the ethical issues surrounding the fictionalizing of the Holocaust. Daniel Schwarz asks in Imagining the Holocaust: "Is the concept of a 'fictive construct' disrespectful to the Holocaust, the events of which are all too true?" (3). Schwarz notes, like Gubar, that "as the survivors pass away ... the written and oral record they leave behind become necessarily the material for future imaginative reconstructions," and that "the artistic rendering of the Holocaust. . . will keep it alive in the imagination particularly as the memoirists dwindle" (23). Schwarz traces the evolution of Holocaust literature from memoir to extremely realistic fiction to fictions that experiment with myth, parable, fable, and fantasy. Yet he points out that even writers who depart from realism, like Art Spiegelman in Maus or Aharon Appelfeld in his parable-like short stories, often revert to documentary techniques and verisimilitude, what Schwarz calls "docufiction" (195). He argues that authors revert to documentary techniques because they are afraid that innovative or experimental "aesthetic decisions risk dishonoring the dead and trivializing the Holocaust" (36-37).</page><page sequence="5">Coffey 31 Fugitive Pieces meets Schwarz's definition of "docufiction," since it is a fictionalization of Holocaust memoir. The first section is supposed to be a lost manuscript of a child survivor, and the second section is supposed to be the memoir of a second-generation survivor. Yet Fugitive Pieces departs radically from "docufiction" in blending poetic language into the already blurred boundaries of memoir and fiction. Its lyric voice and engagement with the pastoral mark a divergence from earlier literature of the Holocaust. Fugitive Pieces and Elegy While all literature of the Holocaust is in a sense elegiac, the genre of elegy seems inadequate for a literature of the Holocaust, in which it is not just the death of one person that is mourned, but the death of six million in a genocide. The conventional structure of the elegy is based on processes of substitution, compensation, resurrec tion, and redemption. The ways in which elegy models psychological processes of mourning is analyzed by Peter Sacks in his classic study of the English elegy. Sacks correlates the structure of the elegy with a Freudian model of mourning based on "a withdrawal of affection from the lost object and a subsequent reattachment of affection to some substitute for that object" (6). The substituted object may be the regenerative powers of nature. In the pastoral, the mourner's grief is displaced onto nature. The central device in pastoral elegy is the pathetic fallacy, in which nature, personified and anthropomor phised, mourns in sympathy with the elegist and in which nature's cycle from autumn or winter to spring reflects both the resurrection of the deceased and the successful mourning of the elegist. Sacks locates the roots of elegy in rites surrounding the cult of Dionysus and other vegetation deities and in the pastoral eclogue initiated by the Greek poet Theocritus in his Idylls of the third century B.C. The basic structure of the elegy, suggests Sacks, is modeled on "rituals associated with the death and rebirth of vegetation gods" that entail a "passage through grief and darkness to consolation and renewal" (19, 20). Vegetation gods like Adonis, Thammuz, and Dionysus underwent a dismemberment followed by a resurrection. The Grail myth of the Fisher King who must be healed in order for the Waste Land to recover its fertility is a paradigmatic example of this type of myth. By identifying the deceased with the resurrected vegetation god, the elegist affirms the possibility of immortality for the deceased. Thus, the elegy traditionally contains symbols of fertility, sublimated images of sexual force and reproduction, and a reintegration of life and death through replacement of images of death and decay with images of regeneration.</page><page sequence="6">32 Blood and Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces Yet processes of consolation and sublimation seem neither de sirable nor possible in a literature of the Holocaust, and the pastoral element of the elegy seems especially jarring and inappropriate in the context of the Holocaust because the language and the mythos of the pastoral had been so thoroughly appropriated by the Nazis. Jahan Ramazani points out in his study of twentieth-century elegy that "fierce moral objections to the compensatory imagination [of the traditional elegy] belong to a post-Holocaust vision of history" (70). Holocaust elegies, argues Ramazani, "refuse the closure, rebirth and substitution traditional in the elegiac genre" (8). The traditional pastoral elegy departs from trauma in allowing a resolution that is not possible in trauma. As Saul Friedlander points out, no "mythical redemptive moment" is possible in telling the history of the Holocaust, and "the best of literature and art dealing with the Shoah [does not] offer any redemptive stance" or illusion of closure (255). The task of writers of Holocaust literature has been to find a way to adequately represent trauma. Dori Laub and Daniel Podell argue that the purpose of what they call the "art of trauma" is to "achieve a representation of that which defies representation" (992), but usually through an "indirect and dialogic" approach that can "come close to representing the emptiness at the core of trauma" (993). For Michael Rothberg, the type of literature that comes closest to representing trauma is what he calls "traumatic realism," in which a "commitment to documentation and realistic discourse" (99) is bal anced out by an awareness that the Holocaust is an event that can never be truly represented. Rothberg argues that "traumatic real ism" is characterized by an "unsettling of spatiotemporal boundaries" (165) and "maladies of time and space" (175). Rothberg's definition of "traumatic realism" draws on Cathy Caruth's theories about the belatedness of the experiencing of trauma. Caruth argues that trauma is characterized by a "temporal delay" in which "the traumatic experi ence is not experienced as it occurs, [but] ... is fully evident only in connection with another place, and in another time" (8-9). Rothberg points out that the phrase "after Auschwitz," associ ated with Adomo's injunction that "to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric," is what Mikhail Bakhtin calls a chronotype, or intertwin ing of time and space, with the "after" denoting temporality and the "Auschwitz" denoting space. Yet Rothberg argues that in the trauma of the Holocaust, there is no "after"; "progressive history's fundamental chronological articulation of 'before and after' runs aground at the site of murder" (21). Time becomes layered because the traumatic mo ment persists into the present. Rothberg describes the way in which Delbo's Auschwitz and After illustrates the "specificity of genocide as a disruption of time": "With the fixing of time, the past is at once</page><page sequence="7">Coffey 33 completely present, because trauma stops time, and completely dis tant, because such time is not susceptible to transformation" (167). Rothberg also discusses the "traumatization of space" in Delbo (172), citing examples of characters who are unable to return home or to find a new home because they carry Auschwitz within them, "deeply engraved" in memory, "unalterable, precise, but enveloped in the skin of memory" (Delbo 13). While Fugitive Pieces differs markedly from Rothberg's concept of "traumatic realism" in not sustaining the "commitment to documen tation and realistic discourse" cited by Rothberg, Michaels's invocation of the pastoral has some affinities with the traumatization of time and space elucidated by Rothberg. In some ways, the pastoral has always been traumatic. The temporal and spatial displacements of the pastoral manifest the repression, latency, and projection character istic of trauma. Pastoral is never written by people living in a golden age, in harmony with nature. It is written by people who attempt to recreate what they have lost. As Donald Worster notes, scholars have long remarked that the revival of classical pastoral poetry during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries indicated a longing to restore the harmony between human beings and nature that urban ization and industrialization were beginning to erase (9). If trauma creates an "empty circle," an "absence," or what Nadine Fresco calls the "vertiginous black hole", pastoral has also been, more often than not, predicated on an empty place (Laub 991, qtd. in Laub 992). However, while pastoral elegy has traditionally sought to fill the hole with new life, Michaels's traumatic pastoral attempts to keep the hole visible. Like the traumatic realism described by Rothberg, the traumatic pastoral that Michaels invents in Fugitive Pieces represents trauma through disruptions of time and space. Indeed, the title of one of the novel's chapters, "Vertical Time," epitomizes Rothberg's notion of Holocaust literature as a Bakhtinian chronotype, a layering of temporality. The fundamental metaphor in Fugitive Pieces is lay ers that are uncovered in an archaeological excavation of time and place. "Every moment is two moments," Jakob insists repeatedly in the novel (140,143). The phrase appears both in his melding of Bella and Alex and in his meditations on the death camps: "the painted clock in the Treblinka station will always read three o'clock. Just as on the platform the ghostly advice still floats: 'To the right, go to the right' in the eerie breeze. The bond of memory and history when they share time and space. Every moment is two moments" (161). This "duplicity of history" is enacted in the double structure of the novel; all of the chapter titles in Ben's section duplicate chapter titles from Jakob's section (161). Fugitive Pieces invokes elements of pastoral and elegy but does not attempt to recreate the compensatory function of elegy as Sacks</page><page sequence="8">34 Blood and Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces describes it. There are images of redemption, rebirth, and resurrec tion in the novel. Poetry, love, and nature do at times console the wounded characters. Yet if the underlying mythos of pastoral elegy is healing of the Waste Land through the resurrection of the wounded fertility god, Fugitive Pieces refuses this movement. Not only does Fugitive Pieces reject the elegy's conventional depictions of nature by portraying nature for the most part as a site of wounding and waste, but also the starkest refusal of the novel to recreate the compensa tory apparatus of the traditional elegy can be found in its imagery not of fertility but of infertility. Michaels employs a number of structural and thematic ele ments that link the novel to the elegy. The narration of the book is antiphonal, like the alternating shepherd songs of pastoral eclogue. While the first section functions as an elegy to Jakob's sister Bella, the second section functions as an elegy to Jakob himself. In Ben's section, he uses the conventional elegiac device of apostrophe, ad dressing Jakob as "you" throughout his narration. While Jakob does not repeatedly apostrophize Bella, he does make her the central figure of his memory and mourning, and he writes at the end of his notebooks: "I write these words for all of you. For Bella, for Alex, for Maurice and Irena, for Michaela" (191). Even though Bella and Jakob are the central persons being mourned, there are a number of oth ers, including Jakob's parents, his best friend Mones, Athos, Athos's brother, mother, and wife, Ben's parents, and Naomi's parents. Both Jakob and Ben review the life of the deceased and offer them encomium or praise. In both Jakob's and Ben's sections, fune real rituals are described. Before Athos and Jakob leave Zakynthos for Canada, Athos declares that "We must have a ceremony. For your parents, for the Jews of Crete, for all who have no one to recall their names" (75). Athos constructs a ceremony that he explains to Jakob is based on Greek rituals of mourning—their duties to the dead are "kathikonda" and the release it should bring to the dead is "anakoufisi" (76). The ritual includes throwing camomile and poppies into the sea, pouring fresh water on the waves that "the dead may drink," reading a passage from Seferis, eating a picnic by the sea that "the dead may not go hungry" (75), lighting a lamp, and singing a song for the dead. After Athos's death, Jakob decides that someday he will bring Athos's ashes to Zakynthos, to "land that remembers him" (188), echoing Athos's advice to Jakob after their ceremony for Jakob's parents to "try to be buried in land that will remember you" (76). Years later Jakob does return to Zakynthos with Athos's ashes and bury them under the stones of Athos's wrecked house. Also, after Athos's death, Jakob symbolically pours fresh water into the sea in their flat in Toronto, that "the dead may drink" (120-21).</page><page sequence="9">Coffey 35 Yet Jakob's true ritual for Athos is not the burying of the ashes, but the completion of Athos's book Bearing False Witness. And his true ritual of mourning for his parents is writing his poems; he dedicates Groundwork to Bella and his parents, and his notebooks center on his memories of Bella. Ben, on the other hand, is not comfortable with the work of mourning. He writes that there was "no energy of a narrative in my family, not even the fervour of an elegy" (204). His parents mourned in silence, never even telling him about his two older siblings who died in the Holocaust. Ben is angry at Naomi for saying kaddish for his parents and bringing flowers and prayer stones to their graves. Naomi in her one meeting with Jakob asks if it is foolish to keep bringing flowers to the graves of the dead. Jakob replies, "On the contrary. It seems right to keep bringing them something beauti ful now and then" (208). Naomi tells Ben, "The only thing that you can do for the dead is to sing to them. The hymn, the miroloy, the kaddish. In the ghettos, when a child died, the mother sang a lul laby" (241). Naomi says she would sing the song "Night" for Ben's parents because they heard Liuba Levitska sing it in the ghetto. For Jakob she would sing "Moorsoldaten." Naomi's lullabies and songs introduce Ben to the possibility of elegy, and his narration becomes his own elegy to Jakob but in a larger sense to his parents and to all Holocaust victims. Most of the references to Jewish rituals of mourning in the novel are connected with Naomi. It is ironic that Naomi says kaddish for Ben's parents, because kaddish is traditionally the duty of a son and is meant to be a "spiritual handclasp between the generations, one that connects two lifetimes" (Lamm 158). Kaddish connects not only son and father, but the mourner and all of the previous generations of Jews; Maurice Lamm suggests that the prayer originated as a con solation after the destruction of the first Temple and the subsequent exile of the Jews (154). Jakob writes in his section of the novel, "It's Hebrew tradition that forefathers are referred to as 'we,' not 'they.' 'When we were delivered out of Egypt..." This encourages empathy and a responsibility to the past but, more important, it collapses time. The Jew is forever leaving Egypt" (159). The kaddish prayer enacts just this type of verticality of time, as does Michaels in her novel. Yet Ben's inability to say kaddish for his parents, and his anger at Naomi for doing so, manifest the severing of the continuity of generations as a result of the Shoah. Indeed, this breakdown of family lines is evident as well in the way that Michaels presents motifs of infertility and the death of children, rather than the images of fertility traditionally associated with pastoral elegy. Naomi can no longer sing the lullabies that she</page><page sequence="10">36 Blood and Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces loves because no child comes to her. Ben writes that "all the humor has gone out of her longing" (238). Athos has no biological children, although Jakob is his adopted son. Ben's belated discovery of the short lives and death of his two older siblings, Hannah and Paul, reinforces the sense of a new generation cut off before it can begin. The revelation that Michaela was pregnant at the time of her death clinches the novel's motif of lost or unrealized children. We learn that Michaela planned to name the child after Jakob's lost sister: "If she's a girl: Bella. If he's a boy: Bela" (279). Jakob, although sixty years old, had expressed his longing that he and Michaela might conceive a child in the last pages of his notebook: "You, my son, Bela, living in an old city, your balcony overlooking medieval street-stones. Or you, Bella, my daughter, in your house overlooking a river; or on an island of white, blue, and green where the sea follows you every where. When it rains, think of us as you walk under dripping trees or through small rooms lit only by a storm" (195). Jakob imagines his children in a golden world, in the world he shared briefly with Michaela before their untimely deaths. But Jakob never knew that Michaela was pregnant; she had left him a note under the bed cov ers, discovered so many years later by Ben and Petra. The only children in the novel are Jakob's friends Maurice and Irena's children, whom Jakob says he loves "as he would have loved Bella's children" (174). Jakob recounts atone point that he remembers his mother "urging Bella not to reveal the secret ingredients of her honey cake ... not ever, except to her own daughter, God willing" (193). He also imagines the women of Zakynthos, when they went into hiding, telling their daughters their recipes for "baked quince, for poppyseed cake and ladhera" in case they did not survive to tell them later (40). And Ben recounts how his mother gives Naomi her recipe for honey cake (247-48). Yet there are no more daughters to whom to pass down these recipes. If there were a new Bella, Fugitive Pieces would offer the possibility of an elegiac consolation based on the continuing cycles of life. Michaels refuses to give us this consolation. Barbara Estrin, in an article on the motif of adoption in Fugitive Pieces and in Binjamin Wilkomirski's Fragments, offers a more positive perspective on the lack of biological children in Fugitive Pieces. Estrin argues that Athos's adoption of Jakob and other adoption motifs in the novel are Michaels's attempt to reject the Nazi "preoccupation with blood ties" that underlay Nazi racism and nationalism (276). Estrin argues that in Fugitive Pieces "biology is subverted" (288) and that Michaels "eliminates the racist and nationalistic blood ties of the essentialist family" (296). Estrin points to Athos's attempt in Bear ing False Witness to repudiate Himmler's SS-Ahnenerbe or Bureau</page><page sequence="11">Coffey 37 of Ancestral Inheritance, which was trying to create false German ancestors at Biskupin in order to fabricate evidence of an ancient advanced German culture (Estrin 289). If Nazi ideology was based on the interconnection of blood and soil, Estrin is correct in noting that Michaels severs this myth. Jakob and Athos form a genuine family, and Jakob inherits Athos's familial estate. Both men wander far from their ancestral lands. Other adoption motifs in the novel include Ben's adoption of Athos as surrogate father and Naomi's close relationship to Ben's parents. Estrin is, however, a little too glib in celebrating the role of adoption in the novel. Athos adopts Jakob because the rest of his family has been murdered. Their family is formed in the wake of terrible loss. Jakob's ties to his biological family do matter deeply, and he spends the rest of his life mourning them. Yet Estrin, and perhaps Michaels as well, challenge us to rethink the meaning of blood ties and what Estrin calls the "essentialist family" (296). If blood, like soil, becomes a mythologized and sanctified reason to kill, the fact that Athos and Jakob form human bonds that are not based on either blood or soil may be grounds for hope. Jakob writes that "even as my blood-past was drained from me, I understood that if I were strong enough to accept it, I was being offered a second history" (20). Gubar also notes the adoption theme in Fugitive Pieces and connects it to her analysis of empathie identifications in the novel. Gubar notes that the Holocaust "shattered the patriarchal commu nities of Europe's Jews" and that "[m]ale survivors . . . could never become the heirs of their fathers' places, properties, or positions" (251). Moreover, women's fertility during the Holocaust was destroyed by "[c]ompulsory abortion, routine targeting of pregnant women for death . . . [and] widespread amenorrhea." While Gubar notes that "Jewish men and women had a common stake in reestablishing bro ken genealogies in the postwar period", she sees the adoption motif in Fugitive Pieces as a way of making a substitution for what can not really be replaced (252). She argues that adoption in the novel functions as a metaphor for what Dominick LaCapra calls "empathie unsettlement," which "involves a kind of virtual experience through which one puts oneself in the other's position while recognizing the difference of that position and hence not taking the other's place" (Gubar 253, LaCapra 699). In larger terms, then, Gubar sees a parallel between adop tion and writing, both Michaels's writing as a "proxy-witness" to the Holocaust and the ghostwriting that figures in the novel. She sees Michaels's choice of male protagonists as an acknowledgement of the gap between her experiences and theirs. Gubar locates the ghost writing motif in Jakob's attempts to speak for his lost sister Bella, in</page><page sequence="12">38 Blobd and Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces Jakob's completion of Athos's book, in Ben's unearthing of Jakob's notebooks, and in Michaela and Naomi's roles both as archivists and as "witnesses of witnesses" with Jakob and of Ben's parents, respec tively. They are "repositories of memories not their own" (267). While Gubar does not mention the elegy as a genre, her analysis of adoption in the novel nicely demonstrates how Michaels alters the conventions of the elegy. The fertility motif of the elegy is transformed into an adoption motif. The regenerative cycles of nature are not working. Too much damage has been done. Yet in the midst of what continues to be a wasteland there is the possibility of an empathie identification that provides a different, more qualified and more sober, form of consolation. Nazi Pastoral and Michaels's Revised Pastoral Simon Schama, in Landscape and Memory, addresses the dis sonance between the pastoral tradition and the atrocities committed in seemingly pastoral landscapes. He recounts a visit to the forest at the border of Poland and Lithuania where his Jewish ancestors had made a living by cutting timber. He visits the Lithuanian town of Punsk, where he finds a Jewish graveyard in which the crumbling and unreadable tombstones were "becoming a geological layer" (36). He tells the story of the Nazi occupation of the Lithuanian forest of Bialowieza, which Goring had demanded be protected as a "heilger Hain," a sacred grove. Trees, elk, and bison were not to be disturbed, while the Jewish population was lined up in the groves and shot, dumped into mass graves. Master of the German Forests, Goring envisioned Bialowieza as the center of a vast protected forest zone. Schama writes: Two ideas of the primeval forest were at war in occupied Bialowieza. The goal of German terror, once Jews had been eliminated from the scenery, was to use violence ... to dissuade the local population from taking to the woods as partisans or aiding and abetting those who might already be there. The woods instead became their colony of death, a place of mass executions, dispatched close to the roadside perimeter of the dark forest.... Once its humans had been made docile, the forest could be prepared by dependable German foresters for its proper role as the Greater Reich's most splendid hunting ground. With its Polish-Lithuanian identity wiped out, it could be presented as a great, liv ing laboratory of purely Teutonic species: eagles, elks and wolves. (71)</page><page sequence="13">Coffey 39 Schama notes the dissonance of "landscapes picturesque and sub lime that had been chewed up by war and fertilized by the bones and blood of the unnumbered dead" (19). He characterizes his own book as an "excavation, beginning with the familiar, digging down through layers of memories and representations toward the primary bedrock, laid down centuries or even millennia ago" (17). He cites the work of artist Anselm Kiefer as a metaphor for his own endeavor. Kiefer's work is a "reinvention of traditional forms" of "landscape and history painting" (124), in which he layers and juxtaposes images of Germans forests with images of Nazi atrocity in order to "force together culturally acceptable elements of the German heroic and mythic tradition with its unacceptable historical consequences" (123). In many ways, Michaels in Fugitive Pieces undertakes the literary equivalent of Kiefer's project, although while Kiefer is a German at tempting to confront the sins of his nation, Michaels's work is written from the perspective of the victim. Michaels's engagement with the pastoral fantasies of the Nazis is signaled by her choice of Biskupin as the locus of the first scene of the novel. A key piece in the Nazi attempt to fabricate a glorious Germanic past, Biskupin was an archaeological site in Poland that the Nazis overran and destroyed in order to eradicate evidence that contradicted the theory concocted by the German Ahnenerbe (Bureau of Ancestral Inheritance) that the town was the site of an ancient Ger manic culture and hence proof of Germany's claim to Poland. Biskupin was the ultimate example of Blut und Boden, claiming soil, glorifying bloodlines, falsifying the past. The German fantasy of Biskupin was part of what Raymond Dominick refers to as the "backward-looking pastoralism" (91) of the Nazis and what Robert Pois describes as the Nazi attempt to "[s]ecure a sacred space/time, impervious to cruel historical forces" (151). There is an elegiac element within Nazism, a lament for lost times, an imagined Nordic past in which peasants lived in harmony with nature, before the ravages of modernization, technology, and the First World War. The "maladies of time and space" that Rothberg locates in traumatic realism are present in different form in the Nazi version of the pastoral. A potential critique of Fugitive Pieces is that in engaging with the pastoral fantasy of the Nazis, Michaels unconsciously replicates it, particularly in the character of Athos, the lyric scientist. Jeffrey Herf's term "reactionary modernism," which captures the combination of rational means with irrationalist ends in Nazism, might easily be ap plied to Athos. Like the Nazis, Athos combines what Herf identifies as the Nazi melding of "antimodernist, romantic, and irrationalist ideas" with "the most obvious manifestation of means-end rationality, that is, modern technology" (1). Pois's analysis of the Nazi "religion of na</page><page sequence="14">40 Blood and Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces ture" might also be brought to bear upon Athos's "lyric geology"; Pois argues that what "Hitler had done was to wed a putatively scientific view of the universe to a form of pantheistic mysticism presumably congruent with adherence to 'natural laws'" (39). There are some unsettling affinities between Athos's and Michaels's revised pastoral and the Nazi pastoral: a primitivist and escapist focus on the past; a potentially anti-humanist privileging of nature over the human; and a melding of the rational and irrational through infusing science with the language of sentiment, poetry, religion, myth, metaphor, and ideology. Yet the distinction between Nazi pastoral and Athos's and Michaels's revised pastoral hinges upon differing interpretations of the relationship between human beings and nature. Both Nazi ideology and Athos's "lyric geology" stage a blurring of boundaries between human and nature and science and emotion; both define human beings by an emotional relationship to the land and seem at times to question the implicit hierarchy within Western culture of human over nature. Both also ultimately reinscribe the hierarchy of human over nature, but in different ways. Nazi ideol ogy is simultaneously both anti-humanist and anthropocentric, while Athos's philosophy is simultaneously humanist and anthropomorphic. The Nazis ultimately turn both nature itself and dehumanized persons into objects subject to being manipulated and disposed of by the "fully human"; they empty humans of worth; they turn people into things. Athos, on the other hand, turns things into people; he infuses nature with human emotion and with worth as a way to amplify and mourn the suffering of humans. Recent debates about affinities between the Nazi Blood and Soil ideology and contemporary environmentalism have elucidated key points about the relationship between human and nature in Nazi philosophy and practice. As Schama shows in his portrayal of Bialow ieza, it is a painful and horrifying irony that the Nazis exhibited such reverence for nature at the same time that they completely devalued human life. Anna Bramwell, in her book Blood and Soil: Richard Wal ther Darré and Hitler's "Green Party" (1985) and in her article "Was This Man 'Father of the Greens'?," argues that the Nazi Blood and Soil ideology was one of the foundations of modern environmentalism and that Nazi Naturschutz, or nature protection, used arguments "similar to the arguments which are made by ecologists today" ("Was This Man" 12). Walther Darré, Hitler's Secretary of Agriculture, borrowed the phrase "Blood and Soil" from August Winnig and popularized it in his 1929 book A New Nobility from Blood and Soil. Darré believed in a "holistic trinity" of "peasant-nature-God" (12) and that "man could only live in a fulfilled and happy manner if he retained his link to the soil." He wanted to "abolish industrial society altogether, and replace it with a purely peasant society" (8).</page><page sequence="15">Coffey 41 Like Bramwell, Luc Ferry in The New Ecological Order argues that there is a continuity in the anti-humanism of Nazism and con temporary deep ecology: "in both cases, we are dealing with a same romantic and/or sentimental representation of the relationship be tween nature and culture, combined with a shared revalorization of the primitive state against that of (alleged) civilization" (93). Both privilege nature over culture, irrationality over rationality. Ferry sees this issue both within Nazism and within deep ecology as a split be tween French Enlightenment values and Romantic values, contending that Nazi ecology opposed "French, rationalist, humanist classicism, full of artifice, and the 'German' image of an original nature—primi tive, pure, virgin, authentic, and irrational, because accessible only through the paths of sentiment" (97). Yet Dominick refutes Bramwell's contention of an affinity be tween Nazism and today's Greens and argues that while Nazism and environmental protection contained significant areas of overlap, such as anti-modernism, the Nazis exhibited little actual concern for nature and used Naturschutz as a rationalization for their racist and expansionist ideologies. Dominick writes that the "blood and soil per spective was purely anthropocentric. From this point of view, Nature had value only as a source of vigor for Germany's national soul." In this version of "geographical determinism," "the German people, in particular the peasantry, had defined their character in interaction with the soil of the Fatherland" (87). The "blood" element signifies the Nazi emphasis on genetic inheritance and race. Conservation ist concern with preserving the purity of land and water coalesced with and became a metaphor for racist concern with conserving the purity of the race. Additionally, Dominick argues that when "Hitler invoked Nature, he did so to excuse the ruthless, competitive pursuit of racial or na tional self-interest" (90). Dominick argues that Hitler usually spoke of nature in the context of Social Darwinism, not nature protection. Hitler used nature as a veil for a might-makes-right philosophy and a rationalization for violence. Moreover, Dominick points out the "contradiction between backward-looking pastoralism that was so seductive to some Nazis and the world-conquering plans that were so central to Hitler's own views" (91). Under the Nazis, industrial ization proceeded at breakneck pace. Between 1932 and 1937, for instance, the number of vehicles produced in Germany quintupled and employment in that production quadrupled (Dominick 109). The Nazi regime also "undertook massive public works that threatened serious damage to the environment" (108). Indeed, Bramwell notes that Walther Darré became disillusioned with Hitler because he "had 'betrayed Blood and Soil ideas,' building Autobahnen instead" (11).</page><page sequence="16">42 Blood and Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces Most importantly, one of the Nazis' main uses of industrial technology was to invent more efficient means to kill people. Pois points out the irony of the fact that the Nazis viewed themselves as "life-affirming" in contrast to the "life-alien" Jews (44,45). Yet these "presumed bearers of life had to become purveyors of death" (59) and a "necrophilic fascination with death [was] absorbed into a puta tive religion of life" (150). The debates about Nazi environmentalism reveal the contradic tions inherent in Nazi ideology. While nature was idealized, it was ultimately reified and commodified. Everything was subservient to the anthropocentric drive for the supremacy of the Master Race. Nazi anti-humanism in practice was manifested not in defining all humans as less important than nature, but rather in defining some humans as on the level of nature and thus without rights and dispensable. Michaels directly addresses Nazi anti-humanism in Fugitive Pieces, with Jakob noting that "the German language annihilated metaphor, turning humans into objects" (143). He explains that "Non-Aryans were never to be referred to as human, but as 'figuren,' 'stücke,'—'dolls,' 'wood,' 'merchandise,' 'rags'" (165). Indeed, the word "pieces" in Michaels's title could be a translation of "stücke" and could symbolize the ways in which Jakob and other fugitives from Nazi genocide were dehumanized. It is clear that Athos does not share this type of anti-human ism. His rescue of Jakob attests to his regard for human life. Jakob describes Athos as one who "never confused objects and humans" (167). Moreover, Athos envisions his "lyric geology" as a vehicle for humanism and pacifism. He and his fellow scientist Griffith Taylor "discovered that they shared the same ideas about geography and pacifism, the belief that science must be used as a peace mea sure, what Taylor called his 'geopacifism.' Specifically, they spoke of Nazism's 'Nordic fetish' and anti-Semitism, and how geography could be used against the dangerous fabrications of politics" (82). Athos writes his book Bearing False Witness in order to bring atten tion to the Nazis' murder of his scientific colleagues at Biskupin and to expose the ways in which "Nazis abused archaeology to fabricate the past" (104). Yet there are times when Athos's neo-Romantic rhetoric calls to mind Ferry's indictment of deep ecology as sharing in the "romantic and/or sentimental representation of the relationship between nature and culture, combined with a shared revalorization of the primitive state against that of (alleged) civilization" (93). There are moments in the novel when Athos's consciousness of geological time becomes a kind of scientific pastoral that strangely blends an awareness of history with an evasion of history. In Toronto, for instance, Athos</page><page sequence="17">Coffey 43 and Jakob explore the city's hidden ravines, the sites of "dried-up rerouted rivers" (101), the "gouging and strafing [of] the land" caused by glaciation (102), ancient forests cut down, Iroquois settlements destroyed. Ironically, these excursions to the sites of destruction and erasure were "escapes to ideal landscapes; lakes and primeval forests so long gone that they could never be taken away from us" (102). Jakob describes Athos as "traipsing through vanished, impossibly tall Carboniferous forests" that "swayed one hundred feet above his head in a prehistoric autumn" (49). Jakob writes that to "go back a year or two was impossible, absurd. To go back millennia—ah! that was . . . nothing" (30) and that the "way Athos saw the world, every human was a newcomer" (103). At times, it seems as though geological time becomes a way for Athos to avoid thinking about the atrocities that have taken place during his own lifetime. For Athos, the prehistoric era functions as an alternative golden age. Athos's and Ben's comparisons between historical atrocity and natural disaster run the risk of effacing human agency and diminishing the significance of human suffering. An em phasis on geological time can make the Holocaust appear as a blip on the screen of history. Yet the sum of Athos's approach to suffering is more projection than evasion; he does not so much run away from suffering as see it everywhere. Ben calls Athos a "splendid anthropomorphist" and explains that he "believed that there's no thing that does not yearn" (209). Athos is a master of the pathetic fallacy, and in this sense he practices and expands the tradition of pastoral elegy. In Athos's "lyric geology" (209), the development of limestone is a "spiritual journey" (32). His relationship to place is emotional. He tells Jakob, "If you know one landscape well, you will look at ail other landscapes differently. And if you learn to love one place, sometimes you can learn to love another" (82). He proclaims, "What is a man . . . who has no landscape? Nothing but mirrors and tides" (86). The connection between Athos and a pastoral vision is implicit in his Greek identity and in the explicitly pastoral descriptions of his home islands Zakynthos and Idhra. While Athos is no shepherd, he is keenly attuned to the landscape of his idyllic homeland, with its grottos and groves, fountains and hills. Indeed, in Athos's ceremony for the deaths of Jakob's parents and the Jews of Crete, he explic itly invokes the language of pastoral elegy, stating, "The shepherds will not know to lament them, no prayers will be heard from distant fields amid the cries of sheep and goats" (76). These moments are emblematic of Athos's elegiac relationship to nature and to place. Athos lost his brother, his mother, and his wife Helen at a young age. Athos's best friend Kostas explains to Jakob that "[s]ometimes</page><page sequence="18">44 Blood and Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces Athos becomes very sad, you know, he can be sad for long months and there may be times when he will need you to take care of him" (78). Athos's description of his ritual he and his father performed for the deaths of his mother and brother is a pastoral elegy in min iature: "We visited the salt pans at Alykes, the currant vineyards in the shadow of the Vrachionas Mountains. I was alone with my father. We were inconsolable. We stood silent at the blue grotto and in the pine groves" (27). Athos's focus on natural disaster renders his version of the pastoral starkly different from the Nazi version. Athos's grief for the losses in his own life shapes his view of geology as "a narrative of catastrophe" and of "cataclysm" (48, 101). Jakob writes that Athos "often applied the geologic to the human, analyzing social change as he would a landscape; slow persuasion and catastrophe. Explo sions, seizures, floods, glaciation. He constructed his own historical topography" (119). Athos's fascination with the violent upheavals of the earth is a displacement for his own grief and is echoed in Ben's interest in natural disasters in the latter section of the novel. Jakob writes that Athos was "an expert in buried and abandoned places", such as Biskupin, flooded by the Gasawka river for a thousand years (49). Ben writes later in the novel that "aftermath fascinated me", and the same seems to be true for Athos (228). Another significant difference between Michaels's pastoral and the traditional pastoral is that rather than the vegetation imagery prominent in pastoral and elegy, Michaels's novel is dominated by imagery of soil. Michaels appropriates the centrality of soil as a Nazi image and redefines it in ways that undercut its nationalistic signifi cance and align it with victimization and suffering. Indeed, she some times mixes images of blood and soil in ways that turn Nazi glory into Holocaust horror. As a geologist, Athos is a student and professor of soil; his "private trinity" is "peat, limestone, and archaeological wood" (19). Jakob at the beginning of the novel is buried in the soil, and Ben's father, we find out at the end of the novel, tunneled through the soil with a spoon in order to escape a concentration camp. One of Jakob's books of poetry is entitled Groundwork. Athos uses the pathetic fallacy in speaking of soil. He tells Jakob, for instance, to "try to be buried in ground that will remember you" (76). He asserts that "[w]e long for place; but place itself longs. Hu man memory is encoded in air currents and river sediments" (53). But for Athos and Jakob, the earth is alternately "terra incognita" (136-137) and "terra nullius" (151), replicating the "empty circle," "absence," or "vertiginous black hole" that Laub and Podell associate with trauma. Indeed, holes in the earth are represented repeatedly in the novel, in references to natural disaster, to human destruction,</page><page sequence="19">Coffey 45 to archaeology, and to burial sites. Jakob describes his love for his family as an "unwashed root," a bulb like an eye, which is yanked out of "decay-fed soil" to leave an empty, eyeless socket and a "blind . . . earth," evoking images of Oedipus or Gloucester characteristic of tragedy rather than pastoral (206). In Michaels's ironic reclamation of blood and soil, her personified earth is a traumatized body, and bodies are described as being made of earth. Soil bleeds and blood silts. When Jakob as a child asks him "Athos, how big is the actual heart?" he replies, "Imagine the size and heaviness of a handful of earth" (113). Athos dies because "his arteries silted up like an old river. The heart is a fistful of earth" (117). For Athos, "rivers follo[w] the inconsistencies of land like tears fol lowing the imperfections on skin" (51), and for Jakob Zakynthos "juts like a bone from the skin of the sea" (17). Jakob describes the "faint breathing of rock, fifty thousand years old" (53). Conversely, bodies are equated with the land. When Jäkob meets Athos he emerges from the "[a]fterbirth of earth" (5) wearing a "mud mask" and has "peat-clogged ears"—he is like a "golem," made of clay (12). Athos employs the pathetic fallacy typical of pastoral elegy; his nature is personified and anthropomorphized and its suffering mirrors human suffering. Athos's version, however, is on a grander, more violent, and less reversible scale. While the pathetic fallacy might normally involve the sad song of a nightingale or the lowering clouds of an imminent storm, in Athos's traumatic pastoral a more typical event is an earthquake. Indeed, the epicenter of the idyllic Greek pastoral in the novel, Zakynthos, is struck by an earthquake a few years after Jakob and Athos leave for Canada, and most of the buildings, including Athos's home, are destroyed. We find out, in fact, that Zakynthos had already endured three earthquakes in the past century. Moreover, Zakynthos is the site of the massacre and drowning of Jews. There is no site that is immune from violence and harm. Athos's fascination with the exploration of Antarctica provides both an antithesis to the pastoral Greek setting and another narra tive of trauma, both for the explorers who perished there and for the land itself, "tectonically torn from an immense continent, from which Australia, India, Africa, Madagascar, and South America fractured, crumbled, strayed" (35).While for Athos geology itself is a narra tive of catastrophe and cataclysm, Athos and Jakob also note the ways in which human action lacerates the land. Jakob describes the "wounded landscape from Zakynthos to Athens," site of Nazi pillage and massacre, noting that "the landscape of the Peloponnesus had been injured and healed so many times, sorrow darkened the sunlit ground. All sorrow feels ancient. Wars, occupations, earthquakes;</page><page sequence="20">46 Blood and Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces fire and drought. I stood in the valleys and imagined the grief of the hills" (60). He also describes how the landscape of Europe has been "cut" and "penetrat[ed]" by the railway lines that brought Jews to death camps (51). Michaela's body is the only eroticized, rather than trauma tized, landscape in the novel; Jakob "roam[s] the surface of her," "explore[s]" her like a "territory," describes "the cave her hair makes" (180) and its "scents of fields and pines" (178), the "forests of bone in her wrists and feet" (181), "her breasts soft loam, hard, sore seeds" (183). Indeed, Jakob experiences his most positive connec tion to the earth and to nature with Michaela: "It is not on Idhra or on Zakynthos but among Michaela's birches that I feel for the first time safe above ground, earthed in a storm" (189). Athos's "cosmology" is also transferred via Jakob to Ben, whose lyric meteorology parallels Athos's "lyric geology." Ben is also an an thropomorphist who asserts that "nature remembers," trees "carry the memory of rainfall," "a forest shares a history which each tree remembers even after it has been felled" (211). Like Athos, Ben fo cuses on natural disaster. He writes about weather and biography and weather and war. His interests include tornados, hurricanes, storms, avalanches, lightning, and floods. The great flood of the Humber River during Hurricane Agnes in 1954, which destroys his parents' home, parallels both the ancient flooding of Biskupin and the earthquake on Zakynthos. Jakob's first chapter and Ben's first chapter are both called "The Drowned City." The traditional elegiac motif of river in both cases becomes a river that floods and wipes out cities. Michaels further revises the pastoral in Fugitive Pieces by pre senting forests not as sites of idyllic peace, but rather sites of self burial and of massacre. At the beginning of the novel, Jakob hides in the forest after the murder of his parents. For him, it is an experi ence of terror as he buries himself by day and imagines the forest at night as a monstrous body: "The night forest is incomprehensible: repulsive and endless, jutting bones and sticky hair, slime and jellied smells, shallow roots like ropy veins" (10). Jakob's forest experience is echoed in Ben's childhood attempt to replicate his father's experi ence of surviving after escape from a death camp. While on a family vacation, Ben forces himself to walk through the unfamiliar forest alone at night as a "test" (220). His forest, too, becomes a monstrous body: "the forest closed around me like a hag's embrace, all hair and hot breath, bristly skin and sharp fingernails" (22). The climax of the novel, simultaneous with Petra's exposure of Jakob's notebooks, is the revelation that Ben's father had escaped from a concentration camp by, along with others, digging a thirty meter long tunnel with spoons. Ben's narrative reveals the transfor mation of pastoral setting into mass grave:</page><page sequence="21">Coffey 47 Shortly before the war, my parents moved there from Warsaw. Nearby was a peaceful old forest. My parents used to go there for weekend picnics. In 1941, the Nazis removed the name of the forest from the map. Then, over three years, they killed in that little grove. Afterwards, the remaining Jews and Soviet prisoners were forced to reopen the seeping pits and cremate the eight thousand dead. They dug the bodies out of the ground. They put their bare hands not only into death, not only into the syrups and bacteria of the body, but into emotions, beliefs, confessions. One man's memories then another's, thousands whose lives it was their duties to imagine... . The workers were chained together. Secretly, for three months they also dug a tunnel over thirty metres long. On April 13, 1944, the prisoners carried out an escape. ... My father and the others had dug the tunnel with spoons. (279-80) The italics in the passage mark it as a quotation from Jakob, perhaps from Groundwork, in which, Ben tells us, Jakob "recount[s] the geol ogy of the mass graves, [and] it's as if we hear the earth speak" (209). Jakob writes in his notebooks that in "the holy ground of the mass graves, the earth blistered and spoke" (143). Describing the way that prisoners were made to dig up the mass graves, Jakob explains: [T]he dead entered them through their pores and were car ried through their bloodstreams to their brains and hearts. And through their blood into another generation. Their arms were into death up to the elbows, but not only into death—into music, into a memory of the way a husband or son leaned over his dinner, a wife's expression as she watched her child in the bath; into beliefs, mathematical formulas, dreams. As they felt another man's and another's blood-soaked hair, through their fingers, the diggers begged forgiveness. And those lost lives made molecular passage into their hands. How can one man take on the memories of even one other man, let alone five or ten or a thousand or ten thousand; how can they be sanctified each? (52) In Ben's and Jakob's passages about the mass graves, blood and soil receive the ultimate redefinition. The soil is literally soaked with blood, "the syrups and bacteria of the body." Blood ceases to be a metaphor for racial purity and becomes a physical manifestation of murder. The pastoral grove is revealed as the killing field that it was. The earth is lacerated with the "vertiginous black hole" of trauma. The images of the graves seem to encapsulate Michaels's con cept of writing Holocaust elegy. She envisions her task as putting</page><page sequence="22">48 Blood and Soil in Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces her own hands and arms into the graves, up to her elbows in death and memories, the blood of the victims seeping into her pores, into "another generation." Her challenge is: "how can they be sanctified each?" The image of putting one's hands into the graves concretizes Gubar's notion of "proxy-witnessing" and what LaCapra calls "empath ie unsettlement." Not only does Michaels become proxy-witness, but in her revision of the pastoral, the earth itself becomes proxy-witness. Michaels expands the idiom of Holocaust literature by redefining blood and soil and by refusing to accept Nazi appropriation and proprietor ship of the pastoral. In her novel-length elegy to the victims of the Holocaust, she does not pretend that the earth will suddenly bloom or even soon recover; rather she shows that within the wasteland acts of empathy and compassion enable the transmission of memory and the continuation of a necessary and proper mourning.
