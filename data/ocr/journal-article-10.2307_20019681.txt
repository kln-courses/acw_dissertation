PHILIP BARNES RUDOLF OTTO AND THE LIMITS OF RELIGIOUS DESCRIPTION In a recent study entitled 'Numinous Experience and Religious Language',1 Dr Leon Schlamm has endorsed Rudolf Otto's well known and much dis? cussed account of the relationship of religious experience to religious langu? age, and then used this position to criticize some highly influential voices in the continuing debate on the precise nature of mystical experience. The aim of this paper, in response to Schlamm, is to question the plausibility of Otto's account in The Idea of the Holy2 of the nature of religious knowledge and his closely related understanding of the relationship between religious experi? ence (or as he prefers, numinous experience) and religious language. By implication, this also calls into question Schlamm's use of Otto's position in his criticism of those writers on mysticism that he takes issue with, chiefly Steven Katz and those who propose an essentially Kantian interpretation of mysticism. However, for the most part I shall leave the contemporary debate on mysticism unaddressed, though my comments do have a bearing on it. If there is a wider target, it is chiefly those interpreters of religion, like Schlamm, who conceive of the relationship of religious experience (or the religious object itself) and religious language in essentially the same way as Otto. One thinks immediately here of Friedrich Schleiermacher,3 whom Otto admired greatly, and who stands in the same Liberal Protestant tradition.4 Also Karl Barth, who ironically, for all his strictures of Liberal Protestantism, actually propounded a view of the meaning and nature of religious language which is remarkably similar to the views of both Schleiermacher and Otto; at least at the beginning of his theological career, in his famous commentary on Romans', all that talk of God as 'the inexpressible' and 'the Wholly Other'.5 In addition one could mention those classical texts of Hinduism and 1 Religious Studies, xxvm (1992), pp. 533-51. 2 (London: Oxford University Press, 1950), the title of the original work in German is Das Heilige 'the Holy'. 3 The Christian Faith (Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1928), an English translation of the 2nd substantially revised edition of 1830; see Chap. 1, particularly pp. 3-31 and pp. 76-8. 4 See Otto's ' Introduction ' to Friedrich Schleiermacher, On Religion : Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1958) ; also Otto 'How Schleiermacher Rediscovered the Sensus Numinis', in Religious Essays (London: Oxford University Press, 1931), pp. 68-77. 5 (London: Oxford University Press, 1933), a translation of the 6th German edition (1918), see particularly pp. 36, 42, 49, 98, 141, 250, 331, 422 and 505. Initially Barth took Otto's The Idea of the Holy as supportive of his own ' dialectical ' or ' neo-orthodox ' theism, but on further reflection became critical of it.</page><page sequence="2">220 L. PHILIP BARNES Buddhism,6 which like many contemporary writers on mysticism (e.g. the late Deirdre Green7), conceive of mystical experience and the truth which it reveals as ' beyond the scope of discursive thought, language and empirical activity'.8 i I shall begin by providing a short summary of Otto's account of numinous experience and the relationship he believes to obtain between religious experience and its linguistic expression. This will clarify the view that I am criticising. According to Otto, experience of the holy, or as he more characteristically calls it, numinous experience, is 'the innermost essence of religion', and that which gives religion its distinctiveness. The holy has both a rational and a non-rational aspect or nature. The rational nature of the holy allows it to be described and classified, whereas its non-rational aspect, which Otto believes is the more basic and original, is beyond description and communication. At its deepest level the holy is 'ineffable' and 'inexpressible'. Thus experience of the holy is similarly beyond description and qualitatively unlike any other experience. Yet it constitutes the essential source of knowledge of the divine: numinous experience 'is a religious feeling providing a unique form of religious knowledge inaccessible to our ordinary rational understanding'.9 The holy may defy conceptual and rational analysis, but is nevertheless known to us in numinous encounter. Otto's account of the holy focuses (as the sub-title of his book indicates)10 on the relationship of the rational to the non-rational in religion, giving priority to the latter, in opposition to the prevailing religious apologetics of his day. His account of this relationship is also integrally bound up with an equally nuanced and controversial interpretation of the nature and function of religious language. For Otto, the truth of religion extends beyond the boundaries of language. There are religious truths too deep for words, in the sense that there are certain religious experiences which cannot be described, but which nevertheless convey knowledge of the holy. Religious experience is primarily a feeling which defies conceptual understanding and lies beyond the domain of discursive reason. Consequently, what is distinctive of religion cannot be adequately communicated by language. Even when we have said all that we can about religion, we still have not touched that which is most vital to it: experience of the holy. Thus religious language is chiefly evocative 6 See the relevant chapters of Walter T. Stace's collection of mystical texts, The Teaching of the Mystics (New York: New American Library, i960), pp. 30-101. 7 'St John of the Cross and Mystical "Unknowing"', Religious Studies, xxn (1986), pp. 29-40, particularly p. 30. 8 T.

The rational dimension of religious faith is parasitic upon a non-rational and non-verbal core. As Schlamm notes, ' [at] the heart of this collection of [Otto's] claims about numinous experience is an epistemo logical assumption about the distance separating religious language and experience'.11 And it is this epistemological assumption which Schlamm himself wishes to clarify and defend. From what I have said, it is clear that there are two central planks in Otto's interpretation of religion : (a) religious knowledge is essentially non conceptual in form; and (b) the parameters of religious experience and truth extend beyond the parameters of religious language. Both together, accord? ing to Otto, entail that what is most real in religion is beyond description and propositional expression. These closely related propositions are common to a number of writers on religion, past and present, of widely different theo? logical and religious persuasions ; provided we allow that different forms of religious experience can be substituted for numinous experience. For ex? ample, as is well known, Schleiermacher regarded ' a feeling of absolute dependence' (das schlechthinige Abh?ngigkeitsgef?hl) as the essence of religion and the type of experience which provided immediate knowledge of God. Schlamm and other contemporary writers want to say much the same thing as Otto, but this time with regard to mystical experience. In what follows I shall challenge the tenability of both (a) and (b), suggesting that neither is tenable in the light of a post-Wittgensteinian understanding of the nature of language and experience, and their relationship to reality. In doing this, I shall also draw attention to the largely apologetic motive which underscores Otto's interpretation of religion; a motive which is frequently overlooked, though not infrequently exploited, by commentators. ii According to Otto, although numinous experience is a genuine encounter with the holy, this encounter cannot be translated into speech : knowledge of the holy is 'inexpressible', beyond conceptual understanding and descrip? tion, and incapable of being grasped by the intellect in its cognitive or rational mode. For him, there seem to be two species of knowledge - immediate awareness, which is non-conceptual or pre-conceptual in form and rational (because conceptual) knowledge. He writes accordingly: Something may be profoundly and intimately known in feeling for the bliss it brings or the agitation it produces, and yet the understanding may find no concept for it. To know and to understand conceptually are two different things, and are often even mutually exclusive and contrasted. The mysterious obscurity of the numen is by no means tantamount to unknowableness.12 11 Schlamm, op. cit. p. 533. 12 Otto, op. cit. p. 135.</page><page sequence="4">222 L. PHILIP BARNES Before considering the plausibility of this distinction between non-concep? tual and conceptual forms of religious knowledge, let us pause briefly to note the apologetic use to which it is put by Otto; for carefully integrated into his account of the nature of religion is a defensive strategy to protect religious truth claims. That this is the motive behind Otto's distinction is made clear in a number of places - no more so than the one I shall quote in full, in a moment. But first I want to place the passage in context. It comes at the end of a chapter on ' Divination in Christianity Today ' - divination here is a technical term for that human faculty by which one 'genuinely' (Otto's word) recognizes the holy.13 Ironically, Otto is referring to the lack of epistemic force numinous experience has for those without such experience. Yet implicitly the point is being made that numinous experience has epi? stemic force for those who do have the experience. From this he goes on to conclude that the rational criticism of those who do not have the experience is of no relevance for those who have, and even more controversially still, and again implicitly, that the truth and proper content of religion entirely depends upon numinous experience (it is after all the essence of religion). Given that what is important in religion is non-rational it follows for Otto that rational apologetics cannot commend religion, and more importantly, rational criticism cannot effectively criticize religion. On this scheme of things, religious faith and commitment to the holy are compatible with extreme scepticism regarding the historical and literary sources of a particu? lar religion. This is the clear implication, as Otto himself notes. There can naturally be no defence of the worth and validity of... religious intuitions of pure feeling that will convince a person who is not prepared to take the religious consciousness itself for granted. Mere general argument, even moral demonstrations, are in this case useless, are indeed for obvious reasons impossible from the outset. On the one hand the criticisms and confutations attempted by such a person are unsound from the start. His weapons are far too short to touch his adversary, for the assailant is always standing right outside the arena ! But if these intuitions, these separate responses to the impress of the Gospel story and the central person to it - if these intuitions are immune from rational criticism, they are equally unaffected by the fluctuating results of biblical exegesis and the laboured justifications of historical apologetics. For they are possible without these, springing, as they do, from first? hand personal divination.1* From this it is quite clear that Otto is attempting to do much more than accurately describe religion. His intention is quite clearly to defend religion against criticism, and he does this by locating what is essential to religion beyond the domain of rational knowledge, by opposing religious intuitions of pure feeling to our normal categories of knowing. It is at this point that his distinction between non-conceptual and conceptual knowledge is most clearly seen for what it is: an apologetic device to safeguard the autonomy of religion and protect religious truth claims from rational criticism. 13 Otto, op. cit. p. 144. 14 Ibid. p. 174, Otto's emphasis.</page><page sequence="5">OTTO AND RELIGIOUS DESCRIPTION 223 But does it make sense to speak of what can be known, in Otto's case the numinous object, while maintaining that knowledge, in his case religious knowledge, is not conceptual knowledge? The plausibility of this position depends on the plausibility of Otto's distinction between non-conceptual knowledge and conceptual knowledge and his assigning of what is important in religion to the former rather than the latter. Of course he accepts that religion can be rationally criticised, but such criticism, because it is con? cerned with what is secondary, i.e. religion in its rational mode, does not detract from religion in its essential non-rational mode. Religious experience is a separate and distinctive moment in human experience and is, in prin? ciple, invulnerable to rational, or for that matter moral, criticism. But how secure is this distinction, and the immunity of religion from criticism which goes with it? Otto assumes that one can distinguish between feeling or awareness and thought, and that although both are categories of knowledge, only the latter is conceptual in form. Yet feeling for Otto has an object: in religious feeling this object is the holy. Thus one feels the holy, knows the holy, but one does not have conceptual knowledge of the holy. As he says the holy ' can be firmly grasped, thoroughly understood, and profoundly appreciated, purely in, with, and from the feeling itself'.15 He postulates the idea of a domain of experience, independent of the formative activity of the mind in applying concepts, in which there is direct contact with a reality which transcends the human self. In a moment of experience untouched by language the holy is revealed to the inner self. Can there be experience of an external object, as the holy is believed to be, an experience in which you learn something about the object (should it only be its existence), which does not involve conceptual understanding? Otto writes in places as if religious feelings can be isolated from religious concepts without loss of meaning. Rather I would suggest that if the feeling of the holy is intentional, then it cannot be specified apart from reference to its object, and thus it cannot be independent of thought. One difficulty for Otto is that religious experience cannot be specified without reference to the holy: ex? perience without reference to the holy is not religious experience. In addition, this reference to the holy also requires, or presupposes, that the feeling, the religious feeling, is the result of divine operation; without this judgement the experience again remains without religious import. (Of course there is no problem about having experience of x where you know nothing about x and learn nothing about x in the process, even x's existence.) To invoke the holy as the cause of experience/feeling is to employ concepts, and quite complex concepts at that, such as the concept of divine agency, the notion of an invisible, powerful, personal spirit, etc. The criteria for identifying religious experience include reference not only to concepts but also to a specific belief 15 Ibid. p. 34.</page><page sequence="6">224 L- PHILIP BARNES about how the experience is to be explained. Explanation and thus concep? tual understanding enter into experience from the outset. There is no privi? leged domain where religion can retreat to and remain immune from criti? cism, for once explanations are given and concepts used, it is appropriate to inquire of their appropriateness and adequacy. Another way of exposing Otto's mistaken account of religious knowledge as non-conceptual is to question his assumption that feelings are independent of thought and concepts. I have argued above that despite what he says, his analysis of numinous experience does require the subject of the experience to apply concepts, for it is only by their application that the experience is identified and classified as religious. But one can go further than this and question his general assumption that feelings are independent of language and conceptual understanding. According to Otto, unlike thought, feelings or emotions cannot be accurately conveyed to another in words, but can be known only by acquaintance ; for feelings to be known they must be experi? enced at first hand. At one point toward the beginning of The Idea of the Holy the reader ' is invited to direct his mind to a moment of deeply-felt religious experience, as little as possible qualified by other forms of consciousness. Whoever cannot do this, whoever knows no such moments in his experience, is required to read no further.'16 In the context of Otto's work as a whole his invitation here is again clearly apologetic, for he clearly believes that every? one has deeply felt moments of religious experience. But this is not the point I want to take up at present, rather I am interested in his understanding of feelings and emotions which this passage assumes and reveals ; namely that feelings - feeling of the holy - are, as it were, intensely private. One knows feelings only by acquaintance, as he says, those without the experience/feelings should 'read no further'. In other words, those without the feelings have no understanding at all of what the experience is like. But surely this fits uncomfortably with Otto's opinion, noted earlier, that numinous experience is ineffable or inexpressible : for what is the difference between having an experience which is inexpressible, and cannot be reported in speech, and not having the experience? The result of both is silence. In addition, how is this enjoined silence consistent with his quite full and detailed description of numinous experience?17 But overlooking this, let us just take what he says at face value. In any case he might contend that his description of a numinous experience is actually not descriptive but evocative. I don't think this defence is plausible but let us grant it for the sake of pursuing the argument. For Otto, words do not describe feelings but rather (in some unspecified sense) direct the hearer to the relevant part of his or her own experience. 16 Ibid. p. 8. 17 I have considered the ineffability thesis, i.e. the thesis that religious experience, or even the religious object itself, cannot be described in language, in 'Relativism, Ineffability and the Appeal to Experience: a Reply to the Myth Makers', Modern Theology vu (1990), pp. 101-14, particularly pp. 107-10.</page><page sequence="7">OTTO AND RELIGIOUS DESCRIPTION 225 Words serve as reminders of an experience once enjoyed or as signposts to enable one to discover an aspect of experience previously unattended to, but there all the same. The idea is of feelings and emotions which a particular individual has no language to express, but which still constitute knowledge for that individual. Emotions, as it were, are empty of conceptual meaning, and exist prior to and independently of conceptual understanding; they relate contingently to the language which may subsequently be used to express them. This picture of emotions as directly and intuitively known, and independent of cognitive assumptions, has been challenged by recent work in the philosophy of mind and language, work largely inspired by the philosophy of the 'later' Wittgenstein.18 According to Wittgenstein our feelings and emotions are parasitic on our acquisition of language, for it is in linguistic and conceptual terms that emotions are to be distinguished. Our use of'feeling' words presupposes an interpretative framework of meaning, conceptual and linguistic rules, a shared public world, and so on. It is only against this context that the vocabulary of feeling words are significant and gain a meaning. Once this conceptual content (and context) is recognized, it then raises the issue of whether emotions are appropriate or not to the situation. For example, if the object towards which an emotion is directed is found to be non-existent then the emotional response is in an important sense unjustified or unnecessary. Our assessment of emotions is parasitic upon our assessment of the world and the objects of the world. Against Otto, feelings do not provide independent, non-conceptual, (and sufficient) epistemic grounds for the existence of objects in the external world. He seems to assume that because one has a feeling (without conceptual content!), or emotions of a certain kind, that one is entitled to believe in a corresponding object in the real world, and not just in the imagination. But as I have already argued there are two problems here. In the first place our feelings come already clothed in conceptual dress, they are not immune from criticism and direct in the sense Otto believes. And secondly, feelings can be justified or unjustified, and once this is recognized an appropriate place must be given to reason and argument, so that real objects (by which I mean here objects existing externally and independently of the human self) can be distinguished from imaginary objects. in The second issue I indicated I would address is Otto's account of the relationship of religious truth to religious language, which I summarized under (b), namely, the parameters of religious experience and truth extend 18 See Philosophical Investigations (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1958), and On Certainty (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1967).</page><page sequence="8">226 L. PHILIP BARNES beyond the parameters of religious language. Much of what I have said above has a bearing on this, so we are not beginning from scratch. According to Otto, asking how religious language both functions and acquires its meaning is asking of the relation between the non-rational aspect of the holy and the rational. Religious language is the bridge from experience to description, from the non-rational to the rational. But how is this bridge erected and how does it function? Otto identifies two connections between religious experience, as felt, and its linguistic and conceptual expression : one based on the association of ideas, and related to the ineffability thesis; and the other, which is accorded a more subsidiary role, a Kantian type theory of schematization. O. R.Jones has argued that Otto's use of Kant here is quite foreign to Kant's original intention and not fully compatible with a Kantian epistemology.19 For these reasons I shall omit discussion of this later point and focus on the former. For Otto because numinous experience is non-conceptual there is no natural language to express it (hence his ineffability thesis). However, he does grant that some terms can function in an indirect manner to bring the experience into ' clearer consciousness ', while not actually describing it. Thus numinous experience cannot be described, but it can be evoked or aroused by analogous feelings, i.e. those natural feelings which most closely resemble numinous feelings. This Otto calls 'the law of the association of feelings'.20 I have no doubt that Otto is saying something valuable here, but again there is conceptual confusion. Certainly the descriptive technique of clarifying an experience by drawing parallels with other more familiar experiences is both helpful and illuminating. For example, Otto compares numinous feelings to the creeping feeling one experiences in the presence of a corpse;21 the former are different but not unlike the latter. The drawing of comparisons between one experience and another is common enough to be unproblematic and requires no special attention : it is a case of the more familiar (or, as in the example above, the potentially more familiar) being used to illuminate the unfamiliar. But what of the conceptual confusion I spoke of? Again it relates to Otto's understanding of the nature and function of language in general and religious language in particular. In Chapter vii of The Idea of the Holy, entitled 'Analogies and Associated Feelings ', Otto reflects on how one feeling can ' excite another and call it into consciousness... A feeling... can arouse its like in the mind ; and the presence of the one in my consciousness may be the occasion for my entertaining the other at the same time'.22 But his reflection here is not very deep, for his setting out of the comparison between numinous experience and other forms of experience is of course conceptual and linguistic. (The medium he uses to draw the comparison is literary.) Yet his general view of language is that 19 The Concept of Holiness (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1961), p. 127. 20 Otto, op. cit. pp. 42-9. 21 Ibid. pp. 14-19, and p. 119. 22 Ibid. p. 42.</page><page sequence="9">OTTO AND RELIGIOUS DESCRIPTION 227 feelings cannot be described (because they are non-conceptual, and this in turn is required because they are not expressible in the sense-terms, see below), similarly so with religious feelings. But in drawing the comparison he assumes that feelings, i.e. those natural (non-religious) feelings akin to nu? minous feelings, can be described : natural feelings must be capable of con? ceptual description, for how else is the comparison possible? Feelings must be able to be distinguished from each other in language if real communi? cation is to take place; and Otto assumes this is making his comparison! The second confusion is related to this. Otto writes as if words have a meaning only when that meaning can be specified in terms of sense experi? ence and properties. It is because of this that, for him, the content of'feeling' words, values, the holy, etc, cannot strictly be described, that is, because they are not reducible to sense impressions ; if they were they could be clearly expressed. In this respect his position is not unlike that of the logical posit ivists, who attempted to marry cognitive meaningfulness to empirical verifi ability. A. J. Ayer is typical of this school when he proposes that ' a statement is held to be literally meaningful if and only if it is either analytic or empirically verifiable'.23 On the basis of this, and further revised criteria, it was concluded that religious, and indeed moral, statements were factually empty, literally having no sense. Where Otto differs fundamentally from the positivists is that he believed, unlike them, in a realm of meaning beyond and outside experience as limited by this empiricist criterion. It was in this 'transcendent' realm that he located feelings, values, and of course the holy; and given that such 'realities' cannot be described in sense terms (and thus are according to him non-conceptual), Otto concluded that language was almost totally unsuited to expressing them. Basically such realities were beyond language, though none the less real.24 Otto certainly believed that essentially language cannot express religious meaning and value, and when he was prepared to compromise this by allowing a religious use of language he insisted that words were being used in an 'indirect', 'odd', and 'symbolic' way. Language is appropriate to describe (by way of one to one correspondence) objects, properties, and relationships in the world but when extended analogically and meta? phorically becomes unreliable and conceptually confused. When language is used beyond its natural realm (of sense impressions) its meaning becomes unclear - hence the numinous can be felt but not conceptually known. This account of the relationship between language, experience and reality is deeply flawed. While accepting that Otto does not limit knowledge to what is verified by sense experience, he does nevertheless use this principle to 23 Language, Truth and Logic (London: Gollancz, 1946), p. 9. 24 One is tempted to draw a comparison here with Wittgenstein's conclusion in the Tractatus (London : Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1953), 6.522, when he says that 'there are things which cannot be put into words'. By this Wittgenstein arguably meant such things as ethical values, aesthetics, and more contro? versially, religion.</page><page sequence="10">228 L. PHILIP BARNES distinguish what can be clearly said (and thus conceptual) from what cannot be said (thus non-rational or non-conceptual), or at least from what must forever remain unclearly expressed. Religious language is assigned to the latter. I have already argued that the distinction Otto draws between conceptual and non-conceptual knowledge is untenable, and it is now widely accepted that any attempt to define factual significance in terms of any of the commonly proposed empiricist criteria of meaning is unsatisfactory for both internal and external reasons.25 This leaves one final point: Otto's equation of conceptual and linguistic clarity with what is capable of literal expression, basically what can be expressed in sober, non-metaphorical prose, and his equation of what is unclear and confused with the language of metaphor, language and symbol. Again, for Otto, religion is expressed through the latter, and thus is expressed poorly and unclearly. I have a number of objections to this. First, although quite a number of modern theologians (e.g. Paul Tillich, Karl Barth, John Macquarrie) have contended that we cannot speak literally of God, the truth of this is beginning to be regarded as not at all obvious, once some simple misunderstandings are cleared away. William Alston has argued that much of the opposition to literal talk of God is based on a false association of what is literal with what is univocal or empirical. He perhaps has done more than an other philos? opher to rehabilitate the notion that certain predicates have a literal ap? plication to God, predicates like love, knowledge, powerful, and so on. For Alston, once it is recognized that words with a literal sense can be legitimately used in quite different linguistic contexts (i.e. once the link between 'literal' and 'univocal' is broken), then the way is open for a literal interpretation of many of the predicates we use of God. Our concepts of love, knowledge and power can be purified by eliminating all those features which pertain to embodiment, temporality and so forth, leaving a core of meaning which can be (literally) attributed to God.26 I shall leave the matter here. Secondly, and more importantly, it can even be granted that religious adherents and theologians do use words in an analogical or extended way, but this contra Otto, in itself, does not necessarily lead to confusion, ambi? guity, or loss of meaning. This point can be made in two ways. The first is to note that the equation of clarity with literality is really an unwarranted legacy of verificationism. Lurking at the back of this equation is the notion that there is an ideal descriptive (literal) form of language to which all other linguistic uses must conform in order to be meaningful and truth-stating. The logical positivists certainly thought of scientific language in this way (but see below). Again Wittgenstein's later philosophy has exposed the mistakenness of this. There is no ideal language, either scientific or otherwise, 25 See Richard Swinburne, The Coherence of Theism (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977), pp. 11?49. 26 See the relevant essays in Alston's Divine Nature and Human Language : Essays in Philosophical Theology (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1989) ; also relevant is Barry Miller, 'Analogy Sans Portrait: God talk as Literal but Non-anthropomorphic', Faith and Philosophy, vu (1990), 63-84.</page><page sequence="11">OTTO AND RELIGIOUS DESCRIPTION 229 which provides a blueprint for all meaningful and significant linguistic utterances. In the Investigations Wittgenstein introduces the notions of 'language games', 'forms of life', and the slogan 'meaning as use' to show the way language is a social phenomenon, imbedded in a particular social context, and to illustrate the legitimate variety of linguistic usage. Ordinary language, the thought forms within which we act and think, is filled with metaphor and symbol. Think of the explanatory activity of drawing a comparison, the question 'What is it like?'-literally to what can it be compared ? And a request for a comparison is a request for an analogy. The giving of an analogy makes things clearer (or at least it is intended to), rather than confuses. My second point is closely related to this, for it is to note the role analogy and metaphor play in the sciences. There was a time, not all that long ago, when philosophers of a positivist bent, compared religion unfavourably with science, on the basis, inter alia, that the former employed metaphorical and symbolic language, whereas the latter relied exclusively on a literal use of language. More recent studies of the language and methodology of science, however, have revealed that the scientific enterprise is not as patently objective, verifiable and literal as positivists once imagined. It is now widely recognized that symbols, metaphors, and extended meta? phors in the form of interpretative models play a significant role in scientific description and theorizing. The analogous employment of metaphors and models in science and theology has been noted and explored by a number of writers, most significantly by Ian Barbour,27 Sallie McFague28 and Janet Soskice.29 If'pure' science resorts to metaphor and analogy in the quest for clarity, then it would be churlish to conclude, as Otto does, that the religious use of metaphors tends to disguise and conceal, rather than reveal, religious truth. In this paper I have subjected to criticism Rudolf Otto's highly influential interpretation of religion, which has recently been endorsed by Leon Schlamm. I focused on two particular propositions : (a) religious knowledge is essentially non-conceptual in form; and (b) the parameters of religious experience and truth extend beyond the parameters of religious language. I have argued that neither of these propositions is tenable in the light of recent developments in the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of language. I have also suggested that Otto's intention in sharply distinguishing non conceptual religious awareness from our ordinary categories of knowing is inspired by the apologetic motive of protecting religion's autonomy, not just in the sense of insisting that there is a distinctively religious domain of 27 Myths, Models and Paradigms (London: SCM Press, 1974). 28 Metaphorical Theology: Models of God in Religious Language (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1982). 29 Metaphor and Religious Language (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985) ; also Richard Swinburne, op. cit., pp. 50-84, and idem., Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), pp. 39-51 ; and very recently Iris M.

PHILIP BARNES experience, but in the additional sense that religion, he believes, should be immune from rational criticism. Such a strategy is as misconceived as it is unsuccessful. Equally unsuccessful is Schlamm's attempt to use Otto's position to challenge that line of interpretation of mysticism associated with Stephen Katz, which teaches that mystical experience must necessarily and substantially conform to the particular religious allegiance of the mystic. That Katz's Kantian account of mysticism is deficient, I do not doubt, but it is deficient in ways inaccessible to those who follow Otto's interpretation of religion.30 Department of Philosophy and Politics, University of Ulster, Coleraine, Co.
