<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Proceedings of the Tenth International Congress of Philosophy. E. W. BETH, H. J. POS, Editors, and J. H. A. HOLLAK, Assistant Editor. Amster- dam, North-Holland Publishing Co., 1949. Fascicule 1 and 2. Pp. 1259. The Tenth International Congress, held in Amsterdam, August 11-18, 1948, was notable in many respects. The inaugural address by H. J. Pos begins with a tribute to Leonard Polak, who was to have presided at a pro- posed international congress at Groningen in 1941 which, however, was never held. Before that time the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands. Polak was first removed from the University of Groningen, then sent to a concentration camp, where he died in 1941. It was fitting and appropriate that the volumes of the Proceedings, when they appeared, should be dedicated to Leonard Polak, and that the readers should be reminded of the names of forty Polish philosophers, and countless other human beings, who had fallen victims of Nazism. As the strains of J. S. Bach's Concerto in D Minor for two violins were heard, philosophers were asked to remember this great leader, "of whom the Netherlands will be proud for centuries." In his inaugural address, Professor Pos emphasized the obligation of philosophers to follow reason not only in contemplation, system-building, and strictly scientific work, but in all departments of life, whether personal or social. If reason is the best guide in one field, it is the best guide in all others. Is it not inconsistent, for example, to be progressive in one's scien- tific work and conservative in practical matters? Does not such a man re- main incomplete? "There is nothing so difficult," Professor Pos reminds us, "as to be just toward those manifestations of reason which happen not to be one's own ... yet there ought to be no limitation to the power of reason." The Congress has welcomed all methods and shades of opinion. The regret remains that the Soviet Union did not see fit to participate, and that the Polish philosophers, though their papers appear in the Proceedings, were not able to appear in person at the Congress. Other nations of Eastern Europe were well represented. The theme of the Congress, "Man, Mankind, and Humanity," was not intended to exclude any type of philosophical research, but rather to include every variety. Professor Pos thanked UNESCO for its active cooperation and support, and the results of the UNESCO Conferences appear in the Proceedings. Although only English and French were official languages at the Con- gress, many papers are in German and one in Spanish. The judicious re- striction of the length of the reports, in most cases to two pages, permitted the inclusion of some 340 contributions. This procedure had obvious ad- 426</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 427 vantages, but leaves the reviewer in the lurch. Since the reports are very short, it seems unfair to criticize them; and since they are discrete and dis- connected, it seems unwise to compare them one with another. In this review therefore, many of these papers must be passed over in silence, but it should not be inferred that they are any the less important for that. It will not be possible even to list all the articles. We shall say something however about the different sessions of the Congress. Plenary Sessions. The first three papers explore the idea of man in three historical periods. K. Kerenyi (Tegna) in "Der Mensch in Griechischer Anschauung" follows Jiger in thinking that: "Other nations made gods, kings, spirits; the Greeks alone made men." The Greek idea of man is only to be understood historically, as bound to time and space, and to a par- ticular community. It was not the command of a god, nor the will to power, nor the prospect of eternal happiness, but the glory of completed mankind itself, which fired the Greek mind to excell all others and to achieve the best. The vivid sense of himself had its counterpart in a keen awareness of the non-human. The Greeks achieved solidarity, not with animals or gods, but with their own kind. History, which had evolved such a resplendent image of man, had also made the background dark. The greatest apostrophe to man in Sophocles is a warning of disaster ahead. A. Dempf (Vienna) in "Das Mittelalterliche Menschenbild," traces the conflict of ideas and in- stitutions in the middle ages, and shows how they eventuated in the sci- entific systematique of Albert and the ethical synthesis of Thomas, and in a hierarchy of values involving economic, social, and cultural planning. To him this outcome seems a confirmation of the newest Wissenssoziologie, which implies that "life powers" follow their own inner laws, and build their own institutions. By way of contrast, Antonio Banfi (Milan) in his "L'homme Copernicain," prefers a materialist approach. Adopting the his- torical view of Marx, he finds the basis of modern civilization in the affirmation and coherent development of productive classes, which create a progressive economy, politics and ethics, wherein new spiritual values obtain. The Plenary Sessions also contain two articles, by L. De Raeymaeker (Louvain) and Charles Werner (Geneva), which eloquently acclaim the importance of the Catholic religion, describe its influence on philosophy and the shortcomings of naturalism. Of special interest are the papers of B. Russell, P. Bernays, and K. R. Popper. Russell states five postulates which he holds are required to validate scientific method, and concludes: "I think, therefore, that we may be said to 'know' what is necessary for scientific inference, given that it fulfills the following conditions: (1) it is true, (2) we believe it, (3) it leads to no conclusions which experience confutes, (4) it is logically necessary if any occurrence or set of occurrences</page><page sequence="3">428 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH is ever to afford evidence of any other occurrence." He maintains that his five postulates, of which the most important one seems to be analogy, satisfy these conditions. In his "Die Erneuerung der rationalen Aufgabe," Bernays defends rationalist and mathematical methods in philosophy and the sciences, and answers objections. He praises Spinoza and Leibniz as pioneers of rationalism and calls for a renewal of their effort on a more modern level of circumspection, and criticizes contemporary irrationalism and empiricist excesses. The followers of Mach are said to overshoot their mark when they make perceptual content the real theme of science. The objections to rationalism are valid only against certain unfortunate forms, it has taken. In sharp contrast to many philosophers at Amsterdam, Popper took the view that historical "prophecies" are in no way necessary to the rational conduct of politics, and that historicism is "the relic of an ancient superstition." The trouble is that historicism fails to make a distinction between "scientific prediction" on the one hand, and "unconditional his- torical prophecies," on the other. The historical sciences can legitimately predict, but not prophesy. (The answer, which doubtless occurred to attend- ing philosophers, is that the difference, after all, is relative. Marx evidently did not deny that a solar catastrophe or a tidal wave on earth might negate a predicted crisis or revolution, and in point of fact Marxist predictions might seem to allow for contravening events which, however, are regarded as too improbable to upset calculations.) UNESCO Conferences. (1) Les fondements philosophiques de V'humanisme: John Dewey in his "Has philosophy a future?" (read by S. Hook) discusses one aspect of the present crisis in human affairs, the decline of democracy, and indicates the steps necessary for the reconstruction of philosophy. The bearing of science on the management of human affairs, he argues, "is technical rather than human in a moral sense." It is time to return to the old -conception that "the business of philosophy is intrinsically moral in the broadest sense." The present offers a supreme opportunity to philoso- phers. "If Galileo and his success could look in upon this gathering here today they would say 'It is for you to do for the very life of man what we did for the physical and physiological conditions of that life.' " H. Frere (Brussels) called upon non-believers and "intransigent positivists" to join religious philosophers in restoring in the world true human dignity, while Sv. Ranulf (Aarhus) maintained that Tdnnies's distinction between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft (and perhaps also Durkheim's distinction between mechanical and organic solidarity) unintentionally prepared the ground for fascism, so that there is a fascist threat wherever, as in France, England, and America, it has currency. Ranulf's contention was challenged in the discussion. As his contribution to the discussion of humanism, B. Stokvis (Leiden) argued that the cycle of aggression-collective guilt-</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 429 complex-aggression "invariably arises from the interaction between two different communities." Antisemitism is simply a special case. The only cure for it, he claimed, was to remove the collective guilt-complex. UNESCO Conference. (2) La liberty et son fondement: Ake Petzdll (Lund) recommended a psychological and phenomenological study of the re- sponsible ego presupposed by legal theory and practice, while A. E. Heath (Swansea) advocated a psychological, operational approach to the problem of freedom which would recognize plasticity and unpredictibility as the key ideas. The other papers in this session revolved around democracy, ideals, and peace. Mirko Novak (Brno) emphasized that ideals such as justice and democracy may unconsciously advance material ends, and adds that philosophers might serve science and humanity at the same time by making a sociological study of the reciprocal relations between the economic system of a society, and the ideals and morality it professes. Released from the bondage to intentions, anything but spiritual, which are now leading to a new catastrophe, a morally freer and purer humanity would emerge. UNESCO Conferences. (3) Les differentes conceptions de la democratic et leur fondements philosophiques: The paper of Narcyz Lubnicki (Lublin) adopted an ethics of sympathy, and defined democracy in terms of it, emphasizing equal opportunity and bonheur, brotherhood and cooperation, rather than free speech. A. Kolman (Prague) makes a forthright appeal to philosophers to unite on a program of humanism conceived in Marxist terms, underscoring progress, equality, peace, and anti-fascism. Differences of philosophical schools will soon fade into the background, if acknowledged progressive goals are relentlessly pursued. Paul Arthur Schilpp also pro- posed a program for philosophers. "In this tragic hour" they must help to extend intelligence or rationality to every sphere, and especially to those areas where blind nationalisms and supersensitivity to ideologies is leading the world to the brink. They must help men to realize "the basic unity of mankind," and "the ultimate dignity of man everywhere on this planet." If philosophers could agree to support these three principles, forces seeking to divide humanity would be discountenanced, and progressive tendencies abetted. In the partisan discussion that followed philosophers of both East and West could agree with Dr. Schilpp. The other paper of the panel was a compact sketch of an ethics of democracy by Marten Ten Hoor. One distinction of democracy, he points out, is that in it citizens are re- quired to make the maximum number of moral decisions. He regards the Kantian moral law (third statement) as "an acceptable epitome of the democratic virtues." Man, Mankind, and Humanity. The twenty-five papers in this section are difficult to characterize as a whole. Jos. Kral (Prague) distinguishes</page><page sequence="5">430 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH between the humanitism of Masaryk and various forms of humanism, in- cluding the integral humanism of Maritain, and Soviet humanism. Rap- prochement between these different conceptions can best be effected by taking humanitism as the point of departure, because it is essentially ethical, and makes fewer philosophical assumptions than do the particular human- isms. John Somerville points to the need of a new humanism which would sponsor peace and tolerate all ideologies which condemn war as policy. Sidney Hook advocated a naturalistic humanism. Other symposiasts took a different view, some emphasizing transcendence and supernatural sanc- tions. Others discussed ethical questions. L. Tatarkiewicz (Warsaw), for example, formulated twelve possible relations between morale and bonheur in ethical theory. East and West. The brief reports here deal with Chinese or Indian phi- losophy, sometimes in relation to Western thought. C. Mao expounds two basic principles of Confucianism, while H. H. Dubs shows the development of altruism in this philosophy. Thus Dubs points out that though love was always central in Confucian teaching, it was at first a graded love relating to relatives, but not to all men. Graded love was attacked by Mo-dz and defended by Mencius. Finally, however, universal altruism won out in Confucianism as in the West. A polemical well-documented article by T. M. P. Mahadevan (Madras), "The Place of Reason and Revelation in the Philosophy of an Early Advaitin," argues that "the prominent role assigned to reason in such an early thinker as Guadapada gives the direct lie to the unfounded criticism that philosophy in India is dogmatic and uncritical." B. L. Atreya (Benares) discusses the distinctive features of Indian philosophy. An ideal Indian philosophy, for example, must satisfy all claims of life, "intellectual, emotional, and active." Active? Through the dark ages of foreign rule the Bhagawagita and the Upanishads have "kept burning the torch of the will to be free." Man and Religion. Many aspects of religion are explored. Viscount Samuel in his "Decline of Religion" contends that the challenge to religion in the present period is: "If God is Love, why are there wars?" In attempt- ing to answer this question, philosophy can only go as far as reason permits, and appeals only to the learned. Religion, on the other hand, goes beyond reason and can influence the masses and therefore has a definite advantage. The thesis of the existentialist, M. Blondell (Aix-en-Provence), is in part that man confronted with the disparity between the concrete alternatives of finite ends and the one supreme destiny, cannot alone solve the problem, but must turn to religion. On this choice depends international order and justice. Metaphysics and General Ontology. M. Buber (Jerusalem), in "Zur Situation der Philosophie," agrees with Heidegger's view that truth is an inherent property of being, but rejects his extreme subjectivism. The path to truth</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 431 now leads irremediably through the perils of Vico's historical discovery and Kant's criticism, and through the toils of modern sociological analysis, all of which show the dependence of man's truth in one way or another. Lad. Rieger (Prague) distinguishes numerous historical views concerning time and eternity and their interrelations, while L. B. Geiger (Etiolles) discusses the unity of being and the peculiarities of "being" as a predicate. Risieri Frondizi (Caracas) maintains that the self is something over and above its experiences, and that it is functional and intentional rather than sub- stantial. Charles Hartshorne contends that there are "both necessary and contingent existential judgments," the former being expressible through categories alone; e.g., "something exists." This leads to a discussion of the ontological argument. General Theory of Values. Ethics. Esthetics. Philosophy of Law. Of the many diversely interesting papers in these four sections it will be possible to mention only a few. R. Jolivet (Lyon) states that the problem of a hierarchy of values is not purely psychological, but metaphysical and a priori. The a priori, however, is that of a reason which invents its own destiny according to an order immanent in it. M. Ossowska (Lodz) points out the difficulties involved in restricting value predicates to the type "good" and "beautiful." To admit all predicates expressing praise and blame, however, is also precarious, since then the line between value and descriptive judgments becomes obscured. Almost any predicate could, under some circumstances, express praise or blame. R. Ledrut (Toulouse) makes the existentialist point that since one only realizes value by pene- trating its significance, reflection on value is inevitably practical. D. J. McCracken (Birmingham) argues that value is not an empirical, but an a prior concept. In assessing the value of common sense and scientific evidence in ethics, A. C. Ewing concludes that the criterion of truth in ethics is not immediacy or coherence alone, but coherence between immediate cognitions, empirical as well as non-empirical. Gardner Williams finds three kinds of universality in morals: (1) An ultimate axiological principle applies to everyone, (2) From the individual's standpoint everything ought to help him because he needs it, and (3) "the truth about every particular good is, like all truth, absolutely universal." C. H. Waddington, the well-known British scientist, proposes that ethical validity be tested by the fulfillment of biological func- tion. He admits that the "functional criticism of ethical beliefs stands or falls by the legitimacy of the concept of biological organization," and illustrates what he means by a high degree of organization (with no teleo- logical reference) in a later article (p. 896). In his discussion of esthetic analysis, C. Lalo (Paris) makes the point that the work of art is not a thing since it owes its character to the forces of attraction and repulsion within the field of each enjoyer. Therefore point</page><page sequence="7">432 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH de dogmatisme, sinon relativists. A chacun sa beauty' comme sa verite. The art object is more a possibility than a reality. A polyphonic interplay of all methods is necessary in esthetics. Special praise is due to Gestalt theory for furnishing, free from metaphysics, fertile experimental ideas. H. S. Langfeld gives an interesting account of experimental esthetics in America today. The section on the philosophy of law includes a number of good reports. W. E. Hocking maintains that "interests" are no proper substitute for "rights," but that the concept of "rights" needs radical revision. In the first place, rights can claim public support whereas interests, in general, cannot. Moreover, I am not free to relinquish my right, for it is my duty as well as yours. But how are rights related to our psychological constitu- tion? Our central impulse, Hocking shrewdly surmises, is to make our lives effective, each in his own unique way and, correspondingly, there is only one natural right, i.e., "to fulfill one's task as member of an historical community," a task requiring unique abilities. From this theory it follows that "if a man fails to try to discover and to do his task, the ground of his claim of right ceases to exist: his right is conditioned on his duty." R. Sou6ek (Brno), in his "Quelques remarques sur la liberty," claims that liberty exists where restraining rules are self-imposed. There are differences among individuals and ideologies as to the rank of liberty in the hierarchy of values. At the present stage of human evolution the individualist con- ception is giving way to the collectivist in the economic sphere, but it is likely that freedom of thought will continue to be regarded as an essential attribute of human dignity. R. Haerdter (Freiburg i. Br.) in his "Demok- ratie und Menschenrechte" raises a similar question which, he says, faces all European peoples, namely: "How can the functions of states, pre- destined by masses and technique, be reconciled with man's deepened need for freedom?" Logic and General Methodology. The Conference began with a discussion as to whether indefinable numbers, Heisenberg' principle of indeterminacy, etc., have produced a "crisis of rationalism." J. Benda (Paris) held that the new developments do not threaten rationalism. The twenty-five papers cover a great variety of topics. K. Ajdukiewicz (Poznan), after preparatory definitions, concludes that adequate definitions of truth and denotation can be given only if one starts out with a metalanguage containing as its part the object-language, i.e., the semantic part; but not if one starts out with a purely syntactical metalanguage. This is true not only in semiotic but also, analogously, in epistemology. The probable mistake of idealist philosophers is that they begin with the language of syntax and construct on this basis a language which appears to be an object-language but isn't. "Using this quasi-object-language they show the truth of some proposi-</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS 433 tions (for instance: esse est percipi) which they think erroneously to be propositions of the object-language, whereas in this language they are evidently false." L. Rougier (Levallois) has a valuable report on indetermi- nate, undecidable and meaningless statements. Among other things, he argues that "pseudo-propositions," such as, "the life of the soul is localized in a dimension of space which is not extended," evidently have meaning for their auditors. If we feel a repugnance to assigning a meaning to them, it is because we refer them, not to scientific concepts, but to images sensibles. "This shows the completely subjective character of intuition." Like Rougier, H. Mehlberg (Wroclaw) discusses unverifiable hypotheses, ar- guing in particular that the tendency, since Comte, to dismiss unverifiable, empirical statements as senseless is mistaken, and that they are often quite useful. L. J. Russell distinguishes between propositions and proposals. With regard to the latter for example, people can conflict but not contradict one another. He suggests that such statements as the law of non-contra- diction and the theological principle that God helps to maintain justice in the world, which appear to be true-or-false statements, are really proposals (or partly so). If they can be so interpreted, we are relieved of the necessity of proving them, yet we can still disagree as to their advisability. L. Tar- tarkiewicz (Warsaw) classifies the sciences into nomological and typological, and criticizes Windelband and Rickert for failing to recognize the latter and for introducing "idiographic" sciences which do not exist. F. H. Hinemann (Oxford) contends that the distinction between truths of reason and of fact, though necessary, is not a true dichotomy, and insufficient as a basis for the theory of knowledge. K. Marc-Wogau (Upsala) discusses recent developments of sense-data theory, while J. Kotarbinska (Lod2) gives an account of the evolution of physicalism. B. Fogarasi (Budapest) explains the basic principle of dialectic which, he says, may be regarded as "the relativity of contradictions," except that absolute truth of course is not denied. J. H. Tummers (Steyl) considers the principle of excluded middle (and two other principles the ideas of which are not "fixed") in order to illustrate how such a universal principle is reached by abstraction from details which later become embarrassing, leading to a restriction of the universality. Symbolic Logic and Philosophy of Mathematics. This section is perhaps the most important in the Proceedings, but very little can be reported here. F. Gonseth (Zurich), in his "Les disciplines particulieres et la philosophic," argues, for example, that research in the foundations of mathematics assumes its full significance only within the framework of a general theory of knowledge, but the philosopher must remember both theory and practice, both theory of the world and theory of l'esprit. R. Apery (Paris) concludes that both the classical and intuitionist conceptions in mathematics are</page><page sequence="9">434 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH tenable, and that the mathematician is not obliged to choose between them. G. Alexits and E. Fenyo (Budapest), citing the work of Hilbert, Gbdel, Church, and Skolem, but also that of Brouwer and Heyting, argue that formalism has strict limits, and that it is only its calculated imprecision that creates the illusion that intuitionism is an improvement. They con- clude enthusiastically that in this field dialectical materialism is in a position to show the way. S. C. Kleene writes on intuitionistic logic, J. J. Iongh (Amsterdam), on "restricted forms of intuitionistic mathematics." L. Kalmar (Szeged) discusses unsolvable mathematical problems and con- tends, for example, that since Church's theorem "is a particular case of the (generally formulated) G6del-Rosser theorem," the former cannot show an absolute limit of our knowledge, as is asserted, unless the former does also. Actually, of course, they both point to the insufficiency of closed systems. J. Suranyi (Szeged) and W. Szmielew (Warsaw) both write on dif- ferent aspects of the decision problem. H. B. Curry suggests a new classi- fication of non-pragmatic semiotics. He assigns both syntactics and Car- nap's semantics to aletheutics, which involves truth conditions apart from "interpretation," whereas Tarski's semantics is put in a wholly different division called "hermeneutics," i.e., involving "interpretation," A. Grze- gorczyk (Cracovie) and Maria Kokoszynska (Wroclaw) also deal with semantic theory. The latter undertakes to formulate a sufficient condition for two languages to refer to the same objects. This is not an easy task when it is a question of the language of a science L and the language of its seman- tic metatheory M, since, she argues, "no expression of L can have the same meaning as its translation in M." The only means of deciding the question is to determine whether the two languages are isomorphic with respect to one or more classes of empirical situations E. There are two interesting papers from Helsinki, one by U. Saarnio on "the concept of hierarchy and the logical paradoxes" and one by G. H. Von Wright on confirmation, and there are several papers on induction and probability. Philosophy of Nature. In his observations on scientific method, S. Zawir- ski accepts Duhem's objection to the possibility of experimentum crusis and adds that the negative result of an experiment proves only that the logical product of the constituent propositions is false, not that the whole theory is so. He illustrates the alternatives left open by references to exam- ples from physical theory. L. de Broglie (Neuilly sur Seine) in his "L'es- pace et le temps dans la physique quantique" gives a masterly account of the modern developments of microphysics initiated by Planck and Bohr, which have upset the common-sense conception of space and time, and also that of classical mechanics. Bohr (1916) saw that microphysical reality could not be exactly described within the usual frame of space and time, and that it was necessary to abandon this frame, and also determinism,</page><page sequence="10">REVIEWS 435 on this level. On the other hand, the laws of probability which apply to the microphysical level are such that the frame of space and time "is found to 'emerge' for phenomena of the molar level and assumes a practically rigorous value for the description of our perceptions." De Broglie does not think that idealism is implied or any wavering from the customary realism of physicists. S. I. Dockx (Brussels) touches on some of the same ideas in his "L'evolution epistemologique de la science physique." Garrett Birk- hoff writes on hydrodynamical paradoxes, H. Reichenbach, on the philo- sophical analysis of quantum mechanics. This section which contains many worthwhile papers concludes with a discussion, by J. F. Busch, on the convergence and divergence of the ideas of Einstein and Bergson. Biophilosophy. Narcyz Lubnicki (Lublin) suggests that the argument between the vitalists and mechanists should be changed from an unverifi- able metaphysical question to an issue of practical procedure. For example: Can the complex A be reduced to x, y, and z? could be interpreted: Can A be only, or easily, produced from x, y, and z? L. L. Whyte (London) points out that reversible processes in biology (and physics), formerly regarded as most important, must now be regarded as special cases. Even homeo- stasis in the adult is really morphogenesis. "One-way processes are of a more general character than reversible processes, which represent ideal limiting cases that never actually occur." A deeper understanding of the former is therefore imperative. Whyte holds that the concept of formative process, i.e., decrease of spatial asymmetry in isolable processes, will clarify biologi- cal problems. P. B. Medawar (Birmingham) argues that the "quantifica- tion" of evolutionary theory quickly disposes of the usual objections to natural selection. G. Sommerhoff (Oxford) argues that purposive behavior in animals, as when a bird aims at a grain, is observable and can be formu- lated in purely objective, and if necessary, mathematical terms, without anthropomorphic implications. Using the bird-grain situation as illustra- tion, he presents an equation which expresses the "directive correlation" between beak movements and the positions of the grain, and allows for the variability characteristic of purposive behavior. Philosophical Problems of Psychology. Th. Erismann (Innsbruck) gives an interesting analysis of experiments on space perception in aveugle-ne', but without referring to the literature of the subject, while A. M. Van Den Berck describes lengthy experiments at Louvain to prove that the catego- ries, Reality, Substance, etc., "are prefigured in the visual domain." S. E. Toulmin (Cambridge) considers the logical status of psychoanalytic expla- nation. The analyst is interested in motives rather than causes, in what the patient thinks of himself rather than objective reports; he relies on one witness only and constructs his "causal history" from fictions as well as facts. This emphasis on "reasons for action" as opposed to "causes of ac-</page><page sequence="11">436 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH tion," far from destroying "free will," should help to reinstate it. This brief section covered a variety of topics. For example, J. Jorgensen commented on the problem of other peopk's minds, and V. Tardy (Prague) discussed personality and the unity of opposites. Philosophy of Language. L. Van Haecht (Brussels) gives a phenomeno- logical account of thought and language; intentionality is the essence of thought while language "est le me'diateur entre l'intention premiere et le verbe mental." G. R6vesz (Amsterdam) writes on the origin and prehistory of language, and J. Meyer (Bloemendaal) deals with language as a biologi- cal phenomenon. Philosophy of History. Historical causality is a matter which needs fur- ther investigation, according to K. Schmidt-Phiseldeck (Copenhagen). Journalists, even historians, often use "cause" in an intolerable sense: if they don't like kings, kings become the cause of all evil. But "causes are always numerous and never isolated." History is a conflict between hu- man will and natural necessity. Since men form history in objectifying it, the meaning of events is as important as their cause. B. Wolman (Tel- Aviv) suggests that instead of arguing whether historical laws are possible, the sensible thing is to search for regularities in history. These regularities are very complicated instances of biological laws. Fritz Kaufmann thinks Husserl's method of reduction provides a new method of evaluating our assets and engagements in the world. The historical world is the outcome of historical "sedimentation." The loyalty to earlier causes and decisions is as much a part of life as is the revolutionary part, which the existentialists exaggerate. The loyalty to the future, which is also a faithfulness to the past, can acquire an absolute meaning if-as with Conrad's characters- we hold ourselves open to "the claims of the present ... above all, to the needs of our fellow men." J. Otahalova-Popelova (Prague) explains why time is becoming the point of departure for the philosophy of history. There is a felt need to distinguish historical time with its periods, epochs, its essentially human development, from the time of mathematics, biology, and of mere chronology. Other reasons are given, including the existential- ists' doctrine that the essence of man is "existence in time." N. Baladi (Alexandria) discusses the relation of the past to liberty-how a man was and can be free, in spite of the past and because of it. Although he agrees. with Sartre that liberty is our project in the present aimed at the future, he insists that the past is really incorrigible (though a man may "break" with it), but also fragile, since "it is only a fragment of a life which has not yet said its last word." K. Lowith contrasts Classical philosophy of history with the Christian, and contends that the "modern mind" wavers uncer- tainly between the two. L. Cohen Rosenfield gives an account of Morris R. Cohen's Philosophy of History.</page><page sequence="12">REVIEWS 437 Philosophical Problems of Sociology and Ethnology. Herbert W. Schneider, in his "Social Ideals of American Naturalism," describes the intertwining of social ideals and politics with romantic conceptions of nature. The idea that nature is good and innocent was converted into the doctrine that "in America both man and nature are more innocent, young, virtuous, noble, and generous than in Europe." In the wake of the evolutionist view of na- ture, similarly, came Social Darwinism, loaded with politics, and Henry Adams's social pessimism based on the law of entrophy. Schneider calls attention in conclusion to a new naturalism in America, more modest and aware of actualities, conceiving man not as demiurge or as helpless ob- server, but as participant in nature's doings. G. A. Hahn (Toulouse) lays down the conditions of "depersonalization." Since we have a deep resistance to depersonalization, as shown by extreme individualism ("All the will to power of economic liberalism secretly obeys this 'desir du neant' "), ardent efforts of the individual to effect his own depersonalization are a precondi- tion of mental collectivism. Z. Rudy (Tel-Aviv), in his paper on the con- cept of the "mob" makes, inter alia, the much needed criticism that both the partisans and detractors of the "mob" have failed to distinguish it from "populace," "people," "class," and that their generalizations from special cases are unwarranted. J. A. Passmore (Sidney) urges positivists in social science to recognize and to pursue non-trivial theoretical problems. "The positivist needs a better understanding of his own position. Then he will see that it is not positivism but cowardice which leads him into trivi- alities." F. J. Conde Garcia (Madrid) holds that the three main meta- physical currents of the present time, positivism, pragmatism, and his- toricism, are all based on an interpretation of thought as "impression.)) The increasing neglect of the objective dimension of thought is, he thinks, very grave. Ideas have given way to ideology which since Napoleon has had a pejorative sense. Marx and Engels made this sense decisive. Thought, far from autonomous, was bound to social conditions. But this was not the last blow. The worst was the nihilist critique of intelligence by Nietzsche, Pareto, and others. Findikoglu Ziyaeddin Fahri (Istambul), in his "La sociologogie et la politique" gives an informative account of the develop- ment of scientific sociology in Turkey. The main opponent, which charged it with materialism and insisted upon its own a priori truths was, of course, idealistic philosophy. The latter, however, had no relation to the concrete events. Sociology was faced with the fact that apparently, as the historical materialists say, "all 'science' is a 'social product.' " He illustrates this thesis by nineteenth century examples, and justifies historical materialist analysis of such "hot" problems as "class," "democrary," and "commu- nism," in terms of the political needs of the time. The scientific sociology which is said to be gaining ground in Turkey would seem to be closer to Weber or Mannheim than to Marx.</page><page sequence="13">438 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH History of Philosophy. The forty-seven papers in this 160-page section are interesting, but too diverse and particular to be summarized briefly. We shall merely mention a few of them: A. Dempf (Vienna): "Philoso- phiegeschichte als Wissenssoziologie"; I. M. Bochenski (Fribourg, Suisse): "L'etat et les besoins de l'histoire de la logique formelle"; R. Modolfo (Tucuman): "Le sujet humain dans la philosophic antique"; W. Lutostaw- ski (Krakow): "Plato's Change of Mind"; A. M. De Vos (Louvain): "La 'vrai substance' d'apres la metaphysique d'Aristote"; M. Grabmann (Mu- nich): "Der Anteil Deutschlands am Aristotelismus des Mittelalters." There are papers on Ockham, Gassendi, Descartes, Pascal, Spinoza, Leib- niz, Butler, Hume, Fichte (and existentialism), Hegel, Bolzano, Renouvier, Nietzsche, Bolland, Bergson, Husserl, and Belinski by philosophers of many countries. The Appendix contains three important articles: L. Landgrebe: "Die Bedeutung der Phhnomenologischen Methode fur die Neubegrundung der Metaphysik"; Lad. Rieger: "Le travail comme base de la civilization"; L. E. J. Brouwer: "Consciousness, Philosophy, and Mathematics." There follows the Chronique du Congres, and by way of index, a list of all the speakers at the Congress, with page references. Judging by the Proceedings, the Tenth International Congress compares favorably with previous ones. Thirty nations were represented, and a great variety of viewpoints and methods. The numerous papers from east- ern Europe, and the diversity of topic and treatment they showed, added interest to the Congress. One had the impression that there were more dis- cussions of philosophical aspects of science and more scientifically oriented papers than ever before. The participation of noted scientists was also a favorable sign which, it is to be hoped, will become a precedent for the future. The effort apparent in many articles to extend scientific methods to vital, but highly difficult, areas of social science was notable. On the other hand, there were no jokes (or only four) in the whole Proceedings. Probably something should be done about that. In spite of the dearth of humor, however, and not withstanding the tension of the times, philoso- phers of many lands and persuasions held to their tolerance, devotion, and business-like equanimity.
