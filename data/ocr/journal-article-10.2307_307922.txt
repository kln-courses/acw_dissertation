<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNIVERSAL WAR "b" AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ZA UM: ABSTRACTION TOWARD A NEW PICTORIAL AND LITERARY REALISM Juliette R. Stapanian, Emory University Intensely intricate interrelationships among artistic disciplines highlight much of the experimentation in Russian arts of the early twentieth century. Perhaps the most distinctive and yet most elusive aspect of post-Symbolist painting and poetry of the avant-garde is the notion of zaum' or "trans- rationalism." Extending from the highly analytic as well as synthetic ration- ality of Cubism and Futurism, zaum' stretched towards a new, unfixed lan- guage celebrating the liberation of artistic language itself. This tendency often has been interpreted as demonstrating that zaum' is basically an abstract art. But abstract painting, by definition, involves few references to concrete reality or natural forms, so that a consistent independence from realism arises. In contrast, however, zaum' appears essentially an art of abstraction that actively engages the idioms of traditional realism in a vigorous polemic or dialectic from which a new realism emerges. This dis- tinction between the state of the abstract and the process of abstraction is fundamental to the elucidation of zaum' and becomes particularly clear in an interdisciplinary study of transrationalism in Russian painting and liter- ature. By employing the processes and mechanisms of abstraction, zaum' writers and painters create a dynamic art which draws variably upon the full semantic and formal range covered by the spectrum of conventional realism through the abstract. This concept does much to explain why zaum' suggests the abstract, although Futurists proclaimed zaum' an aesthetics of a new realism opposing the rarefied aesthetics of Symbolism and the cliched forms of 19th-century Realism. Likewise, the process of abstraction pro- vides insight into the changing frameworks of zaum', as reflected in the title of MaleviC's manifesto "From Cubism Toward Suprematism. A New Paint- erly Realism" (Ot kubizma k suprematizmu. Novyj livopisnyj realizm), first published in 1915. 18 SEEJ, Vol. 29, No. 1 (1985)</page><page sequence="2">Universal War "b" and the Development of Zaum' 19 While critics attacked the logic of transrationalism as gibberish or sense- less ravings, interpretations of zaum' are complicated further by variations in the opaque manifestos of its major theoreticians, the Futurists Velimir Xlebnikov and Aleksej Krucenyx. Nevertheless, repeated themes do emerge from these writings, such as their definition of transrational language as "not having definite meaning (not congealed)."' The founders insisted that zaum' provided a universal and free language containing "bits of crumbled- up worlds" that allow the artist fuller expression.2 The assertion that zaum' is "trans-sense" (as its Russian prefix za- designates) finds clarification in an interdisciplinary investigation, whereby the dynamics claimed by zaum' poets not only appear to be paralleled in the pictorial arts but also serve to demonstrate that in the zaum' modality, figurative and nonfigurative be- come mutually conducive rather than mutually exclusive. Except for its development by Kazimir Malevic into an aesthetics of Suprematism, pictorial zaum' has been little studied. Yet, given the call for artistic synthesis, joint consideration of pictorial and verbal zaum' would seem critical to a characterization of the concept of transrationalism in either medium. Just as zaum' poets like Krucenyx and Xlebnikov painted, painters like Malevic and Ol'ga Rozanova wrote "trans-sense" poetry. Interdisciplinary considerations appear particularly pertinent to the book Universal War (Vselenskaja vojna), where Krucenyx proclaims that "zaum' language ... extends a hand to zaum' painting."3 This work consists of two pages of transrational poetry followed by a portfolio of twelve collages probably done by Krucenyx under the influence of Rozanova.4 Scholars consistently refer to these collages as abstract. And yet, Krucenyx himself said, "they were born in the same way that zaum' language was" to form an art of "violent nonobjectiveness" (jaraja bespredmetnost').5 A study of the collages in Universal War must consider the ideas of zaum' painters against the background of Russian literary theory. In this way, the essentially abstractionist-realist rather than abstract nature of zaum' can be delineated. In 1913, Xlebnikov and Krucenyx distinguished two types of Futurist art: one written and viewed in a moment, a "sweeping away of cumbersome constructions" as in the art of Xlebnikov, Krucenyx and Rozanova; the other written and read "tautly" (tugo), with lots of rough spots, like the art of Majakovskij and Malevic.6 Rozanova and Malevic, representatives of the two styles, illustrated an edition of this manifesto which included various examples of avant-garde poems, such as Krucenyx's signature zaum' lyric "dyr bul gyl." Although earlier some Futurists had associated the transra- tional with the irrational,7 "The Word as Such" identifies Futurists (budet- Ijane) as "speech-creators" (redetvorcy) who use "chopped-up words, half- words, and their fantastical, clever combinations (zaum' language)-by this the greatest expressivity is achieved and by this precisely is distinguished the language of direct contemporaneity which has destroyed the former,</page><page sequence="3">20 Slavic and East European Journal congealed language."8 In this way, zaum' emerges to challenge the objective world and its traditional forms of communication. In the turn toward nonobjectivity, transformations of conventional lan- guage along with the breakup and reordering of old semantic "objectives" yielded a new realism, whereby the word or communicative unit could pro- ject its self-value, based in the syntax of its own physical form. These "self- sufficient" units in effect provoked traditional sign-referent representation so as to exceed the confines and predictability of the languages of conven- tional reason. In the distortion of conventional Russian, manipulation of word fragments, and attention to the semantics of sound and isolated let- ters, the obsolescent packaging of the old objectivism was called to task. By breaking up conventional idioms the artist could view the world anew, and language acquired a new immediacy whereby the sign or word became "broader than meaning."9 If Symbolism had claimed the word as less than its referent, and Acme- ism sought a new equivalency, zaum' posed a telegraphic language in which the word would straddle traditional semantic boundaries. A new precision resulted, as the antiquated distinctions among objects and between the phenomenal and noumenal realms were rejected in order to reveal the real- ity of modernism unfixed in old objects (i.e., nonobjective).0l This concept of language found parallels in "nonobjective" painting. Color, line, and form were no longer restricted to the forms of Realism or Symbolism, but themselves became objects in a reordered and extended world revealed by abstraction. Building upon Futurist emphasis on dynamism and Cubist attention to distortion, dissymetry, texture (faktura), and shift (svdig),"1 Krucenyx now declared zaum' an aesthetics of complete shift.12 It is this notion of shift-a movement from a previous or expected position or form-that provides a source for abstraction. In the experiments of the Russian avant-garde during the 1910s and 1920s, it is often impossible to distinguish actual points of transition from one movement into another or to speak of one discipline without consider- ation of another. A major feature of the Russian "art of the future" centers upon a strong proclivity toward the primitive. This was not a retrospective regression to the past; rather, the artist sought the living, generative roots of art. Neo-primitivism, which cut away the elegant but lifeless surface of civilized culture, allowed artists-redetvorcy to touch the living roots of art and pierce beyond the world of familiar forms into a realm of inherent logic or primal "intuition." Such emphasis on intuition, however, was not a license for arbitrariness but a call to acknowledge the inherent logic of art itself. Painters like Malevi6 felt an "intuitive reason" would replace "uncon- scious intuition," and Rozanova said that the new art made use of "creative calculation, a conscious, and motivated attitude-toward particular prob- lems" so that "only now, the painter creates his work in full awareness."13</page><page sequence="4">Universal War "Z" and the Development of Zaum' 21 Majakovskij once wrote that for Xlebnikov, a zaum' writer and neo- primitivist of the most visionary variety, a word "is a self-sufficient force which organizes the material of feelings and thoughts."'4 As such, Xleb- nikov explored the implications of word roots and, according to Maja- kovskij, had created a whole "periodic system of the word."'5 The unveiling of new elements in a resifting of materials became central to this poet's function. Not only did Xlebnikov explore the generative capacities of ver- bal roots, he created images energized from ancient sources. In contrast to Esperanto, formulated at the end of the nineteenth century as an interna- tional language based on word roots common to European languages, zaum' was promoted as a "universal language" (vselenskij jazyk) linked to word "molecules" and protoimages (praobraz).'6 Although much of verbal zaum' poetry is Russian or Indo-European specific, the elements of word, letter, sound-and their pictorial parallels form, color, and texture-became central to the aesthetic of transrationalism. As Krucenyx declared about the word: "We have cut apart the object! We have begun to see through the world.""7 The transrational confrontation of old realities with new realities came to underlie formulations of early alogical art and, later, of suprematist transrationalism. In the preface to Universal War Krucenyx acknowledges that, in addition to the zaum' painting of Rozanova, parallel work was being done by Malevic, who used the "rather meaningless term Suprematism" to describe his art. While these remarks reflect some rivalry between the "Isms" of the avant-garde, they also affirm the ideological coalescence of various major movements in the arts of the time.'8 Malevic's early connection with Cubo-Futurist poets and their development of zaum' proves extensive. While he traces the seeds of Suprematism to his art work for the play Victory Over the Sun (Pobeda nad solncem), his elaboration of that alogical "vision" arose from experiments in cubistic and neo-primitivistic styles. Moreover, in an overview of illustrations done for zaum' verse, neo- primitivist, cubo-futurist, suprematist, and combinations of these styles all appear. Krucenyx once referred to the highly original work of the painter Pavel Filonov as transrational,'9 and the anti-books by the poet-painter Varvara Stepanova, which were comprised of unconventional words splashed across "logical" texts taken from newspapers, were also executed in the name of zaum'.20 It appears then, that, rather than a fixed style of painting-which would negate rejection of "congealed" forms-zaum' is an artistic orientation which extrapolates from reordered reality so that con- ventional representational or semantic units turn upon themselves. The resulting displacement of traditional logic creates a tension that serves to maximize the expressive potential of form and to test the range of plasticity of the artistic medium used, whether verbal, musical, visual, or tactile.</page><page sequence="5">22 Slavic and East European Journal In his article "On Poetry," which included one of his zaum' poems,2' Malevic writes revealingly about the process of pictorial creation and the problem of abstraction from natural forms: Colours burn within the artist, his brain is afire, in him the radiance of nature, transformed in colour, bursts into flame; it ignites on contact with the internal apparatus. And his creativeness rises to its full height with a whole avalanche of colours, in order to go back into the real world and create a new form. But something unexpected happens. Reason, like a cooling-dome, turns the steam back into drops of water, and the rush of steam, which had taken the form of something else, becomes water again. Also the avalanche of formless, coloured masses retrieves those forms which had awoken it. The artist's brush begins to paint the same forest, sky, roots, skirts, etc.22 From the image of a painter trapped by the dictates of reason into the conventional "garments" of natural forms, Malevic proceeds to define the problem of the poet as still more estranged from original creative impulse, for the poet is forced to speak only "through clothes about clothes." Analo- gous to the natural forms through which reason has taught man to view nature, words have become "merely distinguishing signs and nothing more."23 The concepts of the then "Father" of Suprematism echo his ideas of six years earlier in a letter to M. Matjusin: "We have gone as far as the rejection of reason, but we have rejected reason because another kind of reason has grown in us, which in comparison to what we have rejected, can be called 'beyond reason,' (zaumnyj) which also has law, construction (kon- strukcija) and sense.... This reason has found Cubism as a means of expressing a thing."24 The continuity of Malevic's ideas through a six-year period attests to the fruitfulness of transrational aesthetics in a time when the painter's art as well as that of the Russian avant-garde in general underwent rapid and complex changes. More specifically, the progression of Malevi6 from his early "alogical" paintings to what he would call Suprematism involves a transition from alogical confrontation of simplified but still conventionally "recognizable" forms to a distillation of that vision such that fragments themselves become self-sufficient entities against a white void of infinity. On the back of one of his early pictorial "alogisms," Violin and Cow (1911), MaleviC wrote that "[t]he alogical collusion of two forms, the violin and the cow, illustrates the moment of struggle between logic, the natural law, bourgeois sense and prejudice."25 An untitled lithograph of a violin and cow appeared in 1919 in his "On New Systems in Art." Under the picture, the artist wrote of alogism as a way to free art from the "barrier to new subconscious movements" which had been placed by logic.26 Although he acknowledges that the cow and violin are positioned in a cubist construction, the shift in logic in this work distinguishes it from such rationally analytical works as his Woman with Water Pails and Knifegrinder. Rather than a geometrics of conven- tional space, break-up, and simultaneity of objective forms found in those</page><page sequence="6">Universal War "'" and the Development of Zaum' 23 two Cubo-Futurist studies, a heightened polemic with traditional concepts of the objective is established in Violin and Cow. The spectator not only confronts a combination of two seemingly unrelated objects (a cow and violin) without regard for comparative proportions or genre (the violin motif appears in still-lifes and the cow in pastoral landscapes), but the bizarre juxtaposition of the two motifs is underscored by their basically realistic depiction in contrast to the ambiguously fragmented space beyond. Yet a logic to the composition emerges when the pictorial elements are viewed as "self-sufficient" entities.27 Rather than a merely absurd imposi- tion of a cow upon a violin, the curved outline of the cow as form does recall the curvature of the violin. The dissonance of logic-the conflict that brings what one normally associates with a cow into contact with a violin- yields an energy, freed of formulaic restrictions, whereby the spectator is forced to revise his interpretive function between sign and referent. The symbolism of the cow and violin is displaced by the assertion of the forms themselves in a context opposed to naturalistic realism. Another "alogical" canvas, Englishman in Moscow (1914-15) (Illustration A), has been described as comprised of elements which do not "add up to a comprehensible totality."28 Rather than depending upon an outside system for interpretation, the notion of comprehensibility is shifted onto a logic defined by the composition itself. A boldly colorful array of widely varied images of unrelated dimension, the picture offers some unusual combina- tions: a huge signboard fish near points of bayonets, a candle posed before a sword, a church overwhelmed by a huge red spoon. Behind all this looms the torso of, presumably, the "Englishman" in a top hat. Words too join in the clutter, but the scatter is far from random. Although placed outside a "normal" context, it seems highly unlikely that the expression skakovoe obleestvo would hover purely accidentally over the shoulder of the Eng- lishman like an epaulette. It is also significant that the fragment gas ("hour") of the expression eastidnoe zatmenie ("partial eclipse") forms a base form which a clockhand-like arrow sweeps outward. The non-uniform depictions of the letters of "partial eclipse" are themselves, like the objects presented in the composition, integral to the visual impact of the work. But beyond decoration, the unexpected appearance of the phrase "partial eclipse" reflects a meaningful displacement rather than an arbitarary mis- placement of logic. "Eclipse," the assertion of one entity over another, serves as a verbal parallel to the partial obscuring of the face of the Eng- lishman by the "world" around him. Instead of a visual rationality "clothing reality in the full light of conventional reason," the artist takes a "partial" step beyond. Za-um' begins to emerge from za-tmenie. Just as zaum' poems were broken into expressive "word" units that guided intonation, rhythm, and semantic layering, so the visual zaum' of Malevic's alogisms offered a dynamic objectivism or realism of its own.</page><page sequence="7">24 Slavic and East European Journal The jump from an alogical confrontation of traditional objects and non- objective forms to a strictly Suprematist geometry in painting is significant. Despite the role of alogism in early literary zaum', Krucenyx too would later distinguish the transrational from alogic types. In Deklaracija zaum- nogo jazyka (1921) he defines three basic types of word formation: zaum', with an emphasis on music, texture, and the mystical; "the rational" (razumnoe), whose opposite is "the illogical" (bezumnoe); and "the aleatory" (naobumnoe), which includes such categories as the alogical and the acci- dental. Similar shifts in the relationships among "logics" occurred in the pictorial theories of painters like Malevic,29 as alogical distortions and dis- continuities from traditional art reached toward maximum. Yet, in spite of the disruption of conventional semantics, or the variety and size of "gaps" among and within normally distinguishable signs, a complete disengage- ment from meaning does not occur in zaum' art. Instead, by the process of abstraction, new compounds of association arise among the bits and pieces of reordered and expanded reality regenerated by the primordial ether of the living art form itself. The process of abstraction or nonobjectifying revealed that what had been considered visual components or verbal com- ponents were liberated entities, while previous objects were new compo- nents. The planes of color that earlier framed or enhanced "bits of crumbled-up worlds" came to the fore in a horizonless space of Suprematist realism. That this art of nonobjectivity draws upon the dynamics of abstraction rather than rigorously maintains the abstract is demonstrated by works which reflect the new world opened by the airplane and aerial perspective, such as House under Construction (1914-15); by compositions such as Soccer Match (1915), depicting modern concrete reality by uncon- ventional representation; by Malevic's geometric interpretations of the phenomenon of magnetic attraction; and to a certain degree, by his "plan- etary" constructions (planity). Moreover, like Krucenyx, Malevic found emotion and a new mysticism to be central to the new realism.30 In his famous black square against a white ground, he said that quadrilateral served to indicate feeling; and white, the infinity that surrounds it. Discord within Suprematist circles offers further insight into the nature of zaum' aesthetics. In 1919 Ivan Kljun, a former follower of the Suprema- tism of Malevic, wrote, "In Color Art the colored area lives and moves, affording color the utmost force of intensity. And the congealed, motion- less forms of suprematism do not display a new art but reveal the face of a corpse with its eyes fixed and dead."3' The geometric forms of Malevic had become, according to Kljun, a new fixed language which could be perceived as a direct threat to the specific notion of "uncongealed language" central to Krucenyx's concept of zaum'. Kljun's own response to the dilemma came in experiments such as his composition of 1924 in which he shifts from opaque color and the rather definite outline of Malevic to what has been called "Kljun's distorted forms, transparency of color and shimmering out-</page><page sequence="8">Universal War "b" and the Development of Zaum' 25 line" which seem "almost to offer a critique of Suprematism as originally conceived."32 The problem of maintaining transrationalism's unpredictability, vitality, dynamism, and expressive variation was early addressed by Rozanova, whom Kljun greatly admired.33 "There is nothing more awful in the World than repetition, uniformity. Uniformity is the apotheosis of banality. There is nothing more awful in the World than an artist's immutable Face, by which his friends and old buyers recognize him at exhibitions-this accursed mask that shuts off his view of the future . ."34 Rozanova carefully studied the Suprematism of Malevic, but at the time of Universal War she sought new direction by combining elements of Constructivist celebration of materials. The early importance of the process of abstraction35 for Rozanova becomes clear in an article written in 1913: The art of Painting is the decomposition of nature's ready-made images into the distinctive properties of the common material found within them and the creation of different images by means of the interrelation of these properties ... The world is a piece of raw material-for the unreceptive soul it is the back of a mirror, but for reflective souls it is a mirror of images appearing continually.36 (Italics mine, JRS.) Rozanova delineates three steps in the creative act: "1. Intuitive principle. 2. Individual transformation of the visible. 3. Abstract creation."37 For Rozanova, art appears a constructive process initiated in the intuitive con- sciousness to include the abstraction of form from the decomposition of natural images. These ideas closely parallel those of Krucenyx about zaum' poetry. Rozanova collaborated frequently with her husband Krucenyx, and their joint publications clearly credit both of them. Yet, although the Universal War collages of paper and fabric mounted primarily on a ground of blue are regularly attributed to Rozanova in recent catalogues, the only "author" actually acknowledged in the credits of the work is Krucenyx. He too was a painter, and the zaum' artist Kirill Zdanevic attests to Krucenyx's skill spe- cifically in color collage. Whether or not, in addition to his poetry, Kruce- nyx alone did the art work for Universal War, Rozanova's influence on the pictorial art work is readily apparent. In particular, her earlier designs for Krucenyx's War (Vojna)-compelling arrangements of geometric forms- appear older relatives of the Universal War collages.38 Rozanova long exhib- ited interest in papier colle and collage. For the cover of another Krucenyx work, Zaumnaja gniga (1916), she glued a white button to the image of a lopsided, red heart.39 A common scholarly interpretation of Universal War suggests that the collages have no clear relationship to the poetic text (see appendix for text): "In spite of the titles borrowed from the subject of the texts, there are no apparent references to the contents in the artwork, unless we are to trans- pose the themes of the battle and explosions of war into formal compressive</page><page sequence="9">26 Slavic and East European Journal and tensile stresses." The combination of cutout pieces of paper and fabric glued on a blue paper ground represents "very free formations which at times recall Dadaist fortuitousness."40 A close comparison of the collages with the poems, however, suggests that many of their features are neither arbitrary in form nor totally non- representational. In many instances, they are direct illustrations of the verse titles and their style reflects the abstractionist debate of zaum' of the time. Not only do the collages mix geometricized forms like Malevic's with highly irregular forms of a transrational primitivism, but the white ground of Malevic is dropped in favor of blue (except in two collages, including the sole one with only regularized shapes, "Heavy Artillery"). Malevic's use of white to displace the dictatorship of the blue sky offered an infinite space into which the artist would hurl "the semaphore of color."41 In Universal War the trope of the blue sky too is coopted by the new semaphores. Like the incorporation of traditional mythic figures in the poetic text, the use of blue offers a challenge to the "azure mists" associated with Russian symbolist painting. The fluid irregularity of forms in the Universal War collages suggests a style different from that of Malevic, which Krucenyx had called compact (tugo) in contrast to Rozanova's, and his own. Kruce- nyx's idea of zaum' as including "pieces of crumbled-up worlds" in the liq- uid of "uncongealed" language42 emerges pictorially in the collages as shapes of colored paper floating in an unmodulated blue (or white) space. Construction with color was a major concern of Rozanova,43 and paper cutting intrigued many painters of the time, including Matisse. In Universal War, the translucence of the glued forms replaces the transparent planes of earlier Cubism and offers a color mix in the area of overlap among color planes. Because each collage was done by hand, each portfolio is slightly different, and the freedom of the collages to be moved in the portfolio for- mat with a turning or reshuffling of pages enhances the tactility and dyna- mism of the art work as object. In contrast to the harsh texture expected for the theme of war, the artist employs the most fragile tissue paper and fabric as a medium. At the same time that the edge of the paper cut-outs offers a three-dimensional element replacing the traditional role of painted line in a picture, the fineness of the translucent paper minimizes sculptural dimension. Among the collages, the vibrant colors defining irregularly shaped planes are often placed on an energizing diagonal against an ambiguous ground space, thus suggesting the infinity of the universe. The unpretentious, almost child-like forms seem weightless in the horizonless ground, and some of the shapes, such as the brown conical form, are repeated throughout the set of collages. While the Italian Futurist Carra felt the inverted cone was the natural form of an explosion, this shape is also that of a bullet or shell. The frequent recurrence of energetic spikes or jagged shapes further characterizes the tissue shapes. Although such images</page><page sequence="10">Universal War "b" and the Development of Zaum' 27 relate meaningfully to the poems as a whole, much can be learned by first considering a few of the collages and their links to particular poems and titles. The book begins with the statement "Universal War will take place in 1985." The line of standard Russian refers to a shift toward the future and employs a date from Xlebnikov's predictions based on "laws" of history. Like Xlebnikov's mathematical extrapolations from patterns supposedly underlying historical development, the simplified images of the collages reflect abstraction from primal image "roots" devoid of details that have trapped objects in time by identifying them historically. Through the freed "universal language" of zaum', the Futurist finds voice for the concept "universal war." After the introduction, the literary text of the book consists of twelve poems on two pages. Because the poems are numbered consecutively as twelve "pages" (listy), the page references imply ties to the accompanying portfolio of twelve collages. Variation of normal pagination to designate illustration results, for unlike the poems, the collages are not clearly sequenced because of their portfolio format. (As a result, discrepancies in catalogue labeling of reproductions of individual collages arise among recent publications.) Like the collages, all the poems are very concise. Some only consist of a title. Verse lines are irregular, often with single words (especially nouns) serving as lines. Whereas the provocative titles are all in standard Russian, the poems present vibrant sound textures in series involv- ing Russian words, distorted and devised Russian, or evocative, isolated sounds. Grammar or the linkage of word units also mixes conventional and nonconventional Russian, as the stark syntax used to display the sparse verbal units acts to parallel the sense of broad space in the collages among the colored forms. Color and form repetition serve as analogues to sound repetition throughout the poems. Identification with specifically Russian futurism (budetljanin instead of futurist) opens the group of poems, the first of which is entitled "Battle of the Futurist with the Ocean" (Bitva budetljanina s okeanom). The ocean, an earthly cosmos, is followed by the word for a bird, deurka (a little pine finch), centered in the first verse line. A sweet image for a war theme, the bird is then displaced by the ensuring rapid fire of words. Placed spatially in lines, variously indented, the words suggest clanking (Ijazg), "rubbish," "sin," and references to cutting or chopping. Repetition of the rolled r, and sound combinations like Sxur, d,er', the liquid Ijaza, Ijazg, and the reverse jal', play out the idea of war and ocean. Curiously, the Russian for "finch" echoes the root of the verb Sxurit' ("to screw up one's eyes") and so may simultaneously serve as reference to the unusual perspective of the future that unfolds. The text also displays the word gruden' (framing the units grud and den'), an old name for December or November when chopping</page><page sequence="11">28 Slavic and East European Journal and piling took place in the southern regions. The inclusion of the archa- ism, illustrating the significance of neo-primitivism to zaum' sensitivity, marks a stylistic disruption from contemporary Russian and acts to coun- terpoint the theme of the future. When considered with the first poem, the collages reflect abstraction from images traditionally illustrative of concepts evoked in the verbal text. The unmodulated blue ground provides a sense of "ocean" and the combi- nation of cut forms placed in asymmetry to each other objectifies the notion of conflict. The presence of a Futurist promised by the poem's title is not represented in conventional human form in the pictures, but emerges in the "handprint" of the cut edge of the collages. The piece of flowered fabric in one picture (Illustration B) recalls modernist experimentation with a variety of prosaic materials, while motifs of chopping in the first poem are a counterpart to the physical technique of coupage for collage. The fine, glued-on tissue forms which seem to float within the ground act as conceptualizations of the images of water, air, flight, and movement in the text. The use of common materials in the collages-to use the terminology in the poem, the "rubbish" that has invaded the realm of art-further reflects the cosmic earthiness of the Futurist aesthetic. Irregular forms in the picture (Illustration B) cluster about bird-like tail projections which not only anticipate the motifs of a tail and whip in the third poem but also other images such as that of the horse Pegasus in the second poem of the series. The sharply curved fabric "tail" intensifies the dynamism of the composition and may well suggest the motif of Scorpio in the next work, "Battle of Mars with Scorpio." From a confrontation of Futurist and ocean, perspective shifts to a cosmic-mythic plane delineated by Mars and Scorpio. Mars, the red planet named after the god of war and representing the month of March, opposes Scorpius, a summer constellation of the Northern hemisphere. In Greek mythology, a scorpion was ordered by the gods to kill Orion. The stars in the scorpion's claws were later separated by the Romans into the constella- tion Libra. One of the brightest stars associated with Scorpius is the red supergiant Antares, "rival of Mars." Antares provided the ancients an orientation to establish longitude and to direct the positioning of temples. As constellations arise from distinct configurations of stars, so Krucenyx's poetic text provides a distinctive configuration of images and sound patterns: apetit pegas apetite (sic) pegasus apendicit apendicitis (sic)44 xap grabbed xaxen is laughed Ctut' they will read sama herself samka female kamerton tuning fork</page><page sequence="12">Universal War "b" and the Development of Zaum' 29 In the sole two-word line of the verse, the energy of battle emerges as appetite, a notion placed contiguously with the winged horse Pegasus (not capitalized in the Russian text). The mythical creature, a variant of the earlier image of a finch, is then unceremoniously deflated by appetite part- nered by appendicitis. Removal of the superfluous baggage of traditional orthography in the double consonants of "appetite" and "appendicitis," incorporation of a dialectal third-person plural verb (xtut'), formal pro- gression of words from preceding fragments to create beginning-rhymes (apetit/apendicit, xap/xaxen, sama/samka) (and the indelicate result of the sequence samka/kamerton) all reflect a close relationship between verbal manipulation and visual or spatial identity of the printed word. A gram- matical shorthand whereby interrelationships among entities are largely established by their spatial juxtaposition marks a verbal style which closely parallels a technique of composition in collage. The blue background used in the collages, associated earlier with the motif of the ocean, now suggests the sky as well. In one picture (Illustration C) where red-the traditional color of Mars and the symbol of blood-is used, two appendage-like, mir- rored forms separated by a linear motif pictorially recall the separation of Scorpio's claws into the balance Libra. The images in the collage also sug- gest sexual motifs, thereby paralleling other images in the literary text. The issue of resolution indicated by the word reSat' in the first poem is sus- tained here by the motif of the tuning fork. While the image adds to the metallic imagery of the text, the shape of a tuning fork reiterates the splayed appendages of the constellation Scorpio. Yet, because the forms in the collages are not rigorously representational in the conventional sense, they offer a precise correlate to the discord found in war and artistic strug- gle. In addition, the constellation now attributed to the steed of Greek myth appears in the South from perspectives in mid-northern latitudes in the autumn (cf. gruden') and because its distinct, geometric outline is often referred to as "the Great Square of Pegasus." The schematic language of constellations thus finds a coordinate in the geometricized style of the collages. The next poem, "Explosion of a Trunk" (Vzryv sunduka), and a related collage (Illustration D) offer one of the clearest examples in the collection of meaningful analogues in the process of disassemblage from the objective world. The explosions of war are energized in the poem from a verbal "collage" of motifs, including reference to a "full tail of whips." In conjunc- tion with the image of cutting (relet) "with a vengeance" (mest'ju), a rock (kamen') is placed ambiguously as grammatical subject or object, and the violent reaction is verbally realized by the succeeding series of word fragments: gor Cer lyc ox fi ge</page><page sequence="13">30 Slavic and East European Journal This short array of syllables suggests a multitude of associations simultane- ously: e.g., "sorrow" or "mountain" (gor), "blackness" (der), "face" (lyc- possible distortion of lic), and standard exclamations such as ox. If the clusters are read vertically, combinations like gorox, cerfi (eervi?), fider (veder?) arise, and the horizontalfige suggests the crudefiga. In an accom- panying collage (Illustration D), the forms are sharply angular. Yet, the taunting of conventional forms continues, as the picture appears an abstrac- tion whereby a star, representing the force of an explosion, tilts over two elongated rectangles and two large squares, suggesting a blown-apart side of a box or trunk. The title points to a possible play on words, since sunduk is related to eemodan "suitcase," which is also old slang for a large caliber shell in Russian. In "Battle with the Equator," the motif of conflict returns to an earthly expanse. The opening word, rycyrk, when read in the context of universal war, suggests a comic variation on the Russian word for "knight" (rycar')- ancient warrior of sword and spear-with an ending suggesting "circus" (cirk). The title and fragmentation of "logical" verbal forms are tied closely to a collage reflecting an intuitive abstraction from conventional forms (Illustration E). The equator, usually considered an imaginary line bisecting the globe, is translated pictorially into a strong, rectilinear band which acts as if it were an axis for a large mass. Although the circular form may represent the displaced globe, its position on the end of the "equatorial" band may associate it with the sun. As in the other collages, "battle" is waged by dissonance among forms, by color contrast, and by the dynamics of asymmetric placement. "Destruction of Gardens," a "destruction" verbally signified by the absence of any further poetic text, is one of three works comprised only of a title. For these poems, the pictures themselves may take on the weight of a literary text. In a collage for "Destruction of Gardens" (Illustration F), a sharp-toothed form looks as if it were ripped from the center of a squarish, glued-on "plot." It is significant, moreover, that the idea of positive and negative space in the work is inverted, for a still larger jagged shape emerges in the larger square "plot" formed by the blue ground itself. The threat posed in a subsequent title, "Heavy Artillery," is set off-balance by the first word in its poetic text, Stopor. Appropriate to the context of war, Stopor can mean "spin" as in an airplane spin. Its primary meaning, how- ever, is "corkscrew"-here no ordinary domestic utensil, but a "corkscrew to fate" (Stopor roku). The poem then proceeds with jumbled words and images of onions, French alcoves, a sheepskin of swan rye, the sweet smell of provisions, and intoxication of repulsive vodka to demarcate the scene of a military camp. It is, however, a collage (Illustration G) which brings forward the large weapon, for when outermost outline is considered with- out distraction from coloration and component geometric shapes of the glued-on tissue, a two-dimensional side view of a cannon can be discerned.</page><page sequence="14">Universal War "b" and the Development of Zaum' 31 Human-like figures-like the highly anthropomorphic titles of the trans- rational poems-appear to be scattered throughout several collages. In addition, the long, bent shape in a collage (Illustration H) for page number 9, "Germany in a Fervor" (Germanija v zadore), repeated in another col- lage, is flanked by "ammunition"-a cone and circle. In another collage with "Germany in the Dust" (Germanija vo praxe) (Illustration I), this bent form is dismantled into two separate images like crooked "arms" or "boots" near irregular areas of color and a quadrilateral. A verbal disman- tling also occurs as the element pux in the idiom v pux i prax for "utter defeat" in poem 7. The outline of a long, angular form composed of trian- gles and a quadrilateral in another collage with the poem "Request for Victory" (Pros'ba pobedy, Illustration J) echoes the silhouette of a figure kneeling in prayer. Airplane-like motifs emerge from still other configura- tions in the collages. The poetic series concludes with a title that has no verbal text-"Military State." Once again, a collage (Illustration K) in the portfolio elaborates an abstraction from a related, conventional symbol. Because no clear "up" or "down" is designated, the collage has been displayed in various ways. If, however, the pinnacle of the conical form is pointed upward, the outer line of the combined image shapes a crown, historical sign of the state. The pointed "top" of the crown also calls forth the image of the pointed helmets of the German military. Universal War is consistent with the development of zaum' toward a new realism as expressed by Krucenyx, Malevic, and Rozanova. The rule of old reason (razum) is directly attacked in poem 7, where razum is associated by contiguity to "small child" and "rat." Dynamic combination of abstract, abstracted, and reassembled fragments from the old objective world chal- lenge logic to perceive anew. Like a banner emblazoned on the front page of Universal War, a large hard-sign (tverdyj znak) concisely "voices" the new art, for this letter has no corresponding sound in contemporary Russian. Instead, it functions as a separative, a notion that would appeal to the barrier-crossing consciousness of zaum' artists. Isolation of the single letter emphasizes its pictorial value, while the precise selection of the "hard sign" acts as orthographic parallel to the harsh theme of war in the book. Because the placement of the letter occurs immediately under the words "Universal War" on the cover, the hard-sign simultaneously serves as both the last "word" of the verbal title of the work Universal War" and as the dominant pictorial element of the cover design. In this way, illustration and text, concept and object merge into a single element that serves as a meta- phor for the work as a whole. In the process of abstraction, zaum' artists sought to rediscover and explore the plasticity of the arts. Verbal and pictorial forms spilled into new configurations, coalesced with other forms, and shifted into new contexts, so as to exceed their traditional meanings. Bits and pieces taken from con-</page><page sequence="15">32 Slavic and East European Journal ventional logic and brought into new combinations against the continuity of the basic elements of the artistic medium itself dictated the new logic of newly dynamic objects. The new reality was the source of new myth.45 According to Krucenyx, "[i]n a zaum' word there are always parts of var- ious words (of concepts/ponjatij of images), which give a new, 'zaum" (pre- cisely indefinite/neopredelennyj tocno) image."46 What may appear to be indefiniteness in the zaum' "semaphore" from the standpoint of conven- tional idioms becomes a new precision in the dynamic world unveiled by the transrational.47 As such, zaum', or what Rozanova called those "mon- grels of contradictory world view,"48 represents one of the most complex "faces" of European modernism.

Malevic, Englishman in Moscow. Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. Universal War collages. Examples have been published in Kunstlerinnen der Russischen Avantgarde, 1910-1930 (Cologne: Galerie Gmurzynska, 1979); Von der Fliche zum Raum (Cologne: Galerie Gmurzynska, 1974); A. Rudenstine, ed., The George Costakis Collec- tion: Russian Avant-Garde Art (New York, NY: Harry N. Abrams, 1981); and M. Rowell and A. Rudenstine, Art of the Avant-Garde in Russia: Selections from the George Costakis Collection (New York, NY: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1981). Because the collages themselves are not titled, variations in labeling the pictures arise among the four publications. The collages in essence accompany the poetic text as a whole. Thus the titles used below serve merely to identify the particular poem with which I have chosen to explore specific correlations.

For information on the historical context of zaum' see V Markov, Russian Futurism: A History (Berkeley, CA: Univ. of California Press, 1968) and L. Margarotti, M. Marzaduri, G.

The publication includes Suprematist sketches by Kljun. 3 A. Krucenyx, Vselenskaja vojna (Cvetnaja klej) (Petrograd, 1916). Note the grammatical mixing of the feminine, nominative adjective Cvetnaja ("colored") with the word klej. 4 Hubertus Gassner asserts that the portfolios War and Universal War "introduced Suprem- atism into 'book' design"; in connection with the ten linocuts for War by Rozanova that join four pages of verse by Krucenyx, he refers to Rozanova's advice to the publisher about the printing of the linocuts; he then turns to the Universal War collages, "some of which were executed by Rozanova, some by Krucenyx himself' ("Olga Rozanova," in Kunstlerinnen der Russischen Avantgarde, 1910-1930 [Cologne: Galerie Gmurzynska, 1979], 235). Recently M. Marzaduri refers to the art work in Universal War as "abstract" papiers colles done by Rozanova ("Futurismo Menscevico," in L'Avanguardia a Tiflis, 109). In the same work, Rosemary Ziegler mentions that in Krucenyx's album 1918 there appeared collages from Universal War ("Poetika A. E. Krucenyx pory '41°', Uroven' zvuka," 253, fn. 7.). In the published version of Universal War, no credit is paid to Roza- nova with regard to the illustrations. Krucenyx is listed as the sole author. Given his skill in the pictorial arts, he could well have executed the collages which reflect the strong influence of Rozanova, his wife. Krucenyx is in fact credited with "abstract and suprema-</page><page sequence="18">Universal War "b" and the Development of Zaum' 35 tist papiers colles" done for a work in Georgian with Kamenskij and Zdanevic in January and February 1917 (Marzduri, "Futurismo menscevico," 110). Unlike Western art histori- ans, the Soviet scholar Nikolaj XardZiev attributes the art work for Universal War to Krucenyx: "The color gluings (collages) by Rozanova served as a model for the analogical works of A. Krucenyx, who in January 1916 published the album Universal War: twelve collages with zaum' texts" (K istorii russkogo avangarda [Stockholm: Hylaea Prints, 1976], 61). 5 Vselenskaja vojna. 6 A. Krucenyx and V. Xlebnikov, Slovo kak takovoe (1913), in Markov, Manifesty ..., 53. 7 In the collection Troe (1913) Krucenyx refers to the "irrational" as zaum' (Novye puti slova, in Markov, Manifesty . ., 70). 8 From A. Krucenyx and V. Xlebnikov, Slovo kak takovoe (1913), in Markov, Manifesty ..., 57. Illustrations for the booklet were done by Malevic and Rozanova. 9 "Slovo sire smysla" (A. Krucenyx, Novye puti slova, in Markov, Manifesty ..., 66). 10 The confluence of phenomenon and noumenon can be illustrated in Xlebnikov's com- ments "About Contemporary Poetry" (1920), where he writes that "Sometimes the sun is a sound, and the earth-a concept; sometimes the sun-a concept, and the earth-a sound" (N. Stepanov, ed., Sobranie proizvedenij Velimira Xlebnikova [5 vols.; L.: Izd. pisa- telej, 1928-33], V, 222). 11 Discussion of the Cubist notion of "shift" appears in D. Burljuk, "Kubizm," in Poscedina obsgestvennomu vkusu (M., 1912). The notions of "shift" and "texture" became central to zaum' aesthetics. See, for example, Krucenyx, Sdvigologija . and Faktura slova (M., 1923). 12 Krucenyx (Sdvigologija . ., 38) refers to zaum' as "absoljutnyj sdvig." 13 For a discussion of Malevic and the question of the intuitive, see Charlotte Douglas, Swans of Other Worlds: Kazimir Malevich and the Origins of Abstraction in Russia (Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Research Press, 1976, 1980), 54-55, 74-76. John Bowlt provides a brief overview of Malevic's development in Journey into Non-Objectivity (Catalogue, Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, 1980), 6-22. The citations from Rozanova are taken from transla- tions in A. B. Nakov's "Painting = Colored Space," Artforum 17 (Feburary 1979), 54-58. The matter of the intuitive in formulations of Russian modernist art is extensive and complex. In Novye puti slova Krucenyx refers to the third unity of psychic life-"higher intuition," a concept he cites from P. Uspenskij's Tertium Organum (Markov, Manifest} . . ., 66). 14 V. Majakovskij, "V. V. Xlebnikov," Polnoe sobranie socinenij (13 vols.; M.: Xudlit, 1955-61), XII, 24. 15 Majakovskij, "V. V. Xlebnikov," 24. 16 Krucenyx attacks the artificiality of Esperanto in Deklaracija zaumnogo jazyka (1921), in Markov, Manifesty . . ., 179-80. Moreover, it is perhaps one of the clearest indications of the fully intended communicative function of zaum' art that for the most part, writers used traditional alphabets rather than creating totally new lettering systems. As for Xleb- nikov's language "molecules" (Markov, Russian Futurism, 347) or "seeds" (Xlebnikov, O stixax, 1919-20), these concepts appear to have parallels in Krucenyx's theorizations on the notion of "protosound" (pra-zvuk) and "protoimage" (pra-obraz) (Deklaracija zaum- nogojazyka, in Markov, Manifesty . . ., 179). 17 "My rassekli ob"ekt! My stali videt' mir naskvoz'" (Novye puti slova, in Markov, Manifesty ..., 71). The approach toward concrete reality by the Russian modernists acquires spe- cial complexities in the light of post-Symbolism. Krucenyx, who referred to the inade- quacy of conventional logical language to express the alogisms and secrets of life, felt that the limitations of standard language affirm Tjutcev's notion that the spoken word is a lie (mysl' izrecennaja est' lot'; "Novye puti slova," 67). Although Vjaceslav Ivanov had viewed symbolism as an attempt to break the silence suggested by Tjutcev, it essentially</page><page sequence="19">36 Slavic and East European Journal employed a language of the phenomenal world in order to point to the noumenal realm (James West, Russian Symbolism [London: Letheun, 1970], 74). Rather than weighting conventional language in symbolic content, Futurists attempted a breakup of the old idioms of the phenomenal world which distinguished between phenomena and noumena. A reality unfixed in old objects (nonobjective) then could be revealed. Whereas Ivanov defined mythmaking as the revealing of things unseen through the crystal of lower reality to be in the domain of "realistic symbolism" (West, Russian Symbolism, 56) the Futurists claimed new myths in that lower reality itself. The notion of myth-making repeatedly arises in Futurist writings. Xlebnikov was fascinated by ancient myths and the creation of new myths. The manifesto Sadok sudej, signed by Futurists including Xlebnikov and Krucenyx, includes the following: "We con- sider the word creator of myth, the word, dying, gives birth to myth and vice versa" (Markov, Manifesty . ., 52). 18 Along with Rozanova and Malevic, Krucenyx was to contribute to the planned journal Supremus, the first issue of which was to focus on Cubism (Ziegler, "Poetika A. E. Kru- cenyx . . ., 253, fn. 13). 19 See Markov, Russian Futurism, 347-48. Markov also notes a distinction between the idea of zaum' of Krucenyx and that of Xlebnikov. That Xlebnikov felt zaum' would become a different kind of rational language (Markov, 347) well supports the notion of abstraction- ism toward new realism as discussed in this paper. 20 See, for example, Gaust tschaba (1919) by Stepanova. 21 K. Malevic, "On Poetry," Essays on Art (1915-1933), tr. X. Glowacki Prus and A. McMil- lan, ed. T. Andersen (New York, NY: George Wittenborn, 1968), 73-82; the text of Male- vic's poem is as follows (82): Ule Elye Lel Li Onye Kon Si An Onon Kori Ri Koasambi Moyena Lezh Sabno Oratr Tulozh Koalibi Blyestorye Tivo Oryenye Alizh 22 Malevic, "On Poetry," 74. 23 Malevic, "On Poetry," 75. In contrast to the "signs" of conventional language, Boris Kusner, in the preface to Krucenyx's Fonetika teatra (M., 1923), writes: "zaum' language is a language of loud (zyenyx), short and bold signals, a language of maximal dynamism. The meaning of a signal is different not only from one instance to the next-it can change even in the course of the short interim of time which is necessary for its pronunciation" (4). 24 Cited in Douglas, Swans of Other Worlds ... 52. The sense of construction in transra- tional boundary-breaking also appears, for example, in Fonetika teatra where Krucenyx defines zaum' language as "the sole constructive (konstruktivnyj) language" (9). 25 Camilla Gray, The Great Experiment: Russian Art 1863-1922 (London: Thames and Hud- son, 1962), 308. 26 Bowlt, Journey into Non-Objectivity, 54, ill. 62. 27 The theme of the "self-sufficient" picture parallels such concepts as that of the "self- sufficient" word, propounded by Krucenyx and others. Ol'ga Rozanova discussed the "self-sufficient value" of the picture in "The Bases of the New Creation and the Reasons Why It Is Misunderstood," in John Bowlt, Russian Art of the Avant-Garde (New York, NY: Viking Press, 1976), 106. 28 Bowlt, Russian Art ..., 9. 29 For an overview of other links between painting and poetry, see Charlotte Douglas, "View from the New World, A. Kruchenykh and K. Malevich: Theory and Painting," Russian Literature Triquarterly 12 (1975), 352-70. 30 V. Rakitin contends that Rozanova's Suprematism is distinct from that of Malevic by its lack of the mystical ("Illusionism Is the Apotheosis of Vulgarity," Gessner, Kunstlerinnen</page><page sequence="20">Universal War "15" and the Development of Zaum' 37 .... 255). Yet, Rozanova's analytical approach does consider the "soul" of the artist. While she claims "[m]odern art is no longer a copy of concrete objects," her art of the "Abstract Principle" often "transforms" the visible with a keen sensitivity to the "new revelations" of the future (Rozanova, "The Bases of the New Creation . :' in Bowlt, Russian Art . ., 103-10). 31 From Ivan Kljun's "Color Art," in Bowlt, Russian Art . ., 143. 32 M. Rowell &amp; A. Rudenstine, Art of the Avant-Garde in Russia: Selections rom the George Costakis Collection (New York, NY: The Solomon Guggenheim Museum, 1981), 111. 33 Kljun was to have worked with Rozanova and Malevic on the proposed journal Supremus. His article for the catalog of Rozanova's posthumous exhibition in 1918 is translated in Gassner, Kinstlerinnen ..., 218-19. 34 From Rozanova, "The Bases of the New Creation . . .," in Bowlt, Russian Art . .., 109. 35 Abstraction as a generative process in Rozanova's work is clearly demonstrated by Mar- garet Betz in "Graphics of the Russian Vanguard," Art News 75 (March 1976) 52-54; note especially the sequence of lithographs on 54. 36 Rozanova, "The Bases of the New Creation . . "in Bowlt, Russian Art . .. 103. 37 Rozanova, "The Bases of the New Creation .. . , 143. 38 Ironically, Rozanova's significance to an understanding of the Universal War collages is evident even in the sharp discrepancies among the most recent catalogues of Russian avant-garde art. For example, a work attributed to Rozanova appears both in the exhibi- tion catalogue The Avantgarde in Russia: 1910-1930: New Perspectives (Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1980) and in Von der Flache zum Raum, 1916-28 (Cologne: Galerie Gmurzynska, 1974). In the American catalogue the work (ill. 334) is listed as a cover collage for Universal War, but in the German catalogue it is listed (132, ill. 51) as a collage for the zaum' publication War (Vojna), in which she collaborated with Krucenyx. The same collage, however, is not included at all in the reproductions of the art work for Universal War in A. Rudenstine, ed., The George Costakis Collection: Russian Avant-garde Art (New York, NY: Harry N. Abrams, 1981). The picture in question is made up of abstract geometric spaces, images of a city with machine motifs of a propeller and wheel, and a stylized figure of a man near an airplane. This use of representational and abstract forms well illustrates the notion that zaum' must be understood as an art of abstraction rather than solely of the abstract. 39 Frequent note has been made of the distortion of kniga to gniga (from the verb gnit' "to rot") in the title. It is curious, in view of the Transcaucasian connection of zaum' art, that the word gniga also recalls an Armenian word for "the woman." Rozanova herself was a serious poet. Examples of her verse appear in Iskusstvo, nos. 3 and 4 (February 1919). One of these poems, "Ispanija," includes a stylistic mixture of standard Russian, deriva- tive words, and noun chains. 40 Gassner, Kunstlerinnen ..., 235. Rowell and Rudenstine (Art of the Avant-Garde in Russia) agree with Gassner's assertion that "the works themselves are clearly lacking in 'subject matter," and they note further that "the particular stress on asymmetry and dissonance represents a clear departure from the carefully calculated equilibrium of Malevich's contemporary Suprematist compositions" (140). 41 From a translated excerpt of "Suprematism" by Malevic in Bowlt, Russian Art . ., 144. 42 A. Krucenyx, Sdvigologija..., 35-47. 43 In "Vystavka Ol'gi Rozanovoj" (Iskusstvo 4 [22 February 1919], 2), Varst (pen name of Stepanova) asserts that the Suprematism of Rozanova is the "opposite" of the Suprema- tism of Malevic. Malevic "builds his works on composition of quadrilateral forms" whereas Rozanova "builds on color." Malevic, however, recognizes the primacy of the color problem in his writings on Suprematism. See, for example, "Non-Objective Creation and Suprematism" in Malevic, Essays on Art, 120-22; also Douglas, Swans of Other Worlds .... 75.</page><page sequence="21">38 Slavic and East European Journal 44 In Tbilisi in 1919 Kru6enyx published a work entitlied Apendicit. 45 In this connection it appears that the concepts of simultaneity in Cubist and Futurist painting (simultaneities of time, space, and color) appear broadened in zaum' to include a simultaneity of thought and feeling in new forms. 46 Krucenyx, Fonetika teatra, 40. 47 For a perspective on this topic, see D.
