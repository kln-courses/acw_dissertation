<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SHORTEST PATH TO THE TRUTH: INDIRECTION IN FAZIL' ISKANDER OBITUARY NOTICE This essay was completed by Marina Kanevskaya a few weeks before her tragic death at the age of forty-seven. She was hit by a truck on a dark street of Missoula, Montana, where she lived and worked as professor of Russian at the State University. Marina's life was full of rapid turns, but a passion for Russian literature was the true engine that supplied her with joy and ardour despite all the odds of two emigrations, changes of career, job searches, etc. She emigrated from the USSR to Israel at the age of twenty-five; eight years later she moved to the United States. There she continued her lifelong studies of Russian literature at the University of In? diana, where she defended her dissertation on Dostoevskii's Pushkin speech in 1992. The focus on Dostoevskii remained in her monograph The Cruel Critic: N. K. Mikhailovsky's Criticism on Dostoevsky, published by Edwin Mellen Press in 2001. In this book she did not only restore the politi? cal and literary circumstances of Mikhailovskii's 'war' against Dostoevskii, but also argued that this famous opponent of Dostoevskii, in his vindica- tions, actually foreshadowed Bakhtin's theory of dialogism and polyphony of Dostoevskii's novel. What Mikhailovskii was blaming Dostoevskii for, Bakhtin put into the foundation of his new aesthetics. The paradoxality of thought and the ability to discover something new in the texts well read and the road well walked distinguished Marina's approach to literature. No wonder that she could not limit herself to nineteenth-century works. Among the subjects of her numerous essays, published both in English and in Russian, are Nabokov and Evgenii Popov, Nikolai Erdman and Nikolai Antsiferov, the conceptualists and the 'new Russians'. FaziF Iskander was one of Marina's latest interests. She was commissioned to write a biograph? ical article on him for The Dictionary of Literary Biography (expected to be published in 2004), but got involved more than the biographical sketch required. That was her nature?she could not work otherwise. She met Iskander in Moscow, interviewed him, and wrote two articles incorporating her observations on his poetics that did not fit into the strict format of the Dictionary. It is one of these that is printed below. I believe Marina offers a completely new approach to this writer, who was traditionally treated as a social satirist, as for example in Natal'ia Ivanova's 1990 book on him, Smekh protiv strakha ('Laughter vs. Fear'). Marina rediscovers Iskander as a daring modernist investigating the limits of the language and manifesta? tions of logos through focusing on gestures, the expressivity of animals, and children's pre-intellectual reasoning. One can hear Marina's vivid voice, her temper, and her irony in this work, belonging to the vast list of first-rate texts written by her during her unbearably short life. Mark Lipovetsky Marina Kanevskaya submitted this article for publication in MLR in No? vember 2002, when I met her at AAASS in Pittsburgh. Sadly, she did not live to see it accepted and printed, for her death occurred less than a month after the conference. I should like to thank Mike and Masha Levin for their kind permission to publish the article, and Marina's colleague Stewart Just- man for his editorial assistance.?Birgit Beumers.</page><page sequence="2">132 Indirection in FaziV Iskander Realizing that the shortest path to the truth would be the one most perilous for him, Uncle Sandro decided not to give in, but to force his own path to the truth on the prince. (Fazil' Iskander)1 Non-Linear Discourse Fazil' Iskander explores through Uncle Sandro the idea that the shortest path to the truth, besides being the most dangerous, may not be the most apt. Taking this metaphor a bit further, we might suggest that a short and straight path to the truth fragments in Iskander's own work, reflecting both his particular creativity and the expectations of his readers. Herein we find a pattern of serpentine byways, detours, and cul-de-sacs, with but a few straight stretches in the form of aphorisms or didactic maxims. So, what is the truth that Iskander aspires to express? The most concise answer is found in the traditional values encapsulated in Lev Tolstoi's well- known formulas, the 'national idea' (mysV narodnaia) and the 'family idea' (mysV semeinaia).2 In his essay 'An Attempt to Understand Human Nature' (Popytka poniat' cheloveka) Iskander admits that for him literature has always been divided into 'a literature of home and a literature of homelessness'. In the first category he includes, notably, Tolstoi, as well as his own work. 'The literature of home always abounds in greater detail because its universe is the home and one cannot help but touch and identify household objects which are dear to the writer's heart.'3 This definition of stylistic features?the abundance of detail?which marks 'the literature of home' relates closely to the subject of this article and helps explain the function and significance of the non-linearity of discourse in Iskander's work. Non-linear discourse allows Iskander not merely 'to extend the path to the truth', but to convert that path into a way of experiencing the world?from the 'original wisdom'4 of an empirical observation to the truth of a philosophical generalization. In Iskander's work, non-linear discourse operates both on the level of composition and on the level of subject matter and style. A composi- tional feature of Iskander's work is his rejection of a linear plotline in favour of a branching narrative. The dynamics of this technique will be discussed in 1 'Prints Ol'denburgskii' ('The Prince of Oldenburg'), in Iskander, Sandro iz Chegema (Ann Arbor, MI: Ardis, 1979), p. 58. For the English translation, see Fazil' Iskander, Sandro ofChegem: A Novel, trans. by Susan Brownsberger (New York: Vintage Books, 1983), pp. 46-47. 2 Tolstoi's wife, S. A. Tolstaia, related his words in her diary of 3 March 1877: 'In Anna Karenina I love the family idea while in War and Peace I loved the national idea as a result of the war of 1812' (S. A. Tolstaia, Dnevniki, ed. by N. I. Azarova and S. I. Mashinskii, 2 vols (Moscow: Khudozhestvennaia literatura, 1978), 1, 502. Iskander readily acknowledges Tolstoi's influence, e.g. in his essay 'Ruminations of a Writer' ('Razmyshleniiapisatelia'), 'Poets and Kings' ('Poety i tsari'), 'Recollections ofa Novel' ('Vospo- minaniiao romane').

Iskander's utterance confronts the challenge of express- ing verbally that which is a priori inexpressible: a gesture, a look, a particular posture, the barking of a dog, the bleating of a goat, the shape of a tree branch, an ocean wave. These two structural features, (1) the redundant 'branching' (modularity) of the story which tries to embrace what cannot be contained in the plot, and (2) the redundant verbosity of the non-verbalizable, create a para- doxical effect. The first feature exposes the futile effort of rhetorically organized discourse to capture the dialogic complexity of even the simplest moment of everyday life, while the second reveals the futile effort of a rationalizing word to capture a non-verbal phenomenon. This close structural kinship is very im? portant, and will be examined here through the interaction of its elements. The existential tragedy that permeates Iskander's writings is the rapid ero- sion of traditional values. The elders in his idyllic Abkhazia still remember the traditional society in which they lived and the customs and traditions they held dear. Yet the tenets of that life become outdated and disappear right before their eyes. In the preface to Sandro of Chegem Iskander writes: 'In my childhood I caught fleeting glimpses of the patriarchal village life of Abkhazia and fell in love with it for ever. Have I perhaps idealized a vanishing life? Perhaps. A man cannot help ennobling what he loves.'5 The writer makes no claim that Ab- khazian traditions and customs are superior to any others. Yet he is convinced that attachment to tradition ennobles human beings and makes them stronger, while a loss of this attachment makes them weak, vulnerable, and, therefore, cynical. Iskander's 'highland' Abkhazia is different from the new world ofthe 'valley' in that it preserves the memory of its roots.6 In this, Iskander the artist maintains a very distinctive position. Although a romantic, he employs irony and indirection to establish his truth. This is, of course, a basic artistic technique of postmodernism, which can be seen most clearly in such contemporary Russian authors as Liudmila Petrushevskaia and Evgenii Popov. In Iskander's case this trope becomes an element in the structure of an essentially modernistic text.7 With his 'new word' (as Dostoevskii would say),8 Iskander reached educated urban Russian-speakers in a very short time. Indeed, after the publication of his collection 'Forbidden Fruit' (Zapretnyi plod (Moscow, 1966)) he became one of the most popular modern writers in Russia. Critics like Marietta Chudakova and Natal'ia Ivanova argue that his 'new word' arose from the author's firm 5 Iskander, Sandro iz Chegema, 8 (Sandro of Chegem, viii). 6 For the explanation ofthe 'highland' vs. 'valley' antinomy see Iskander's short story 'Utraty' ('Losses'), in Fazil' Iskander, Stoianka cheloveka. Povestii rasskazy (Moscow: Pravda, 1991). 7 The evidence for seeing Iskander as a modernist is found primarily in the objectives he proposes for his work ('harmonizationof life' and 'mastering the chaos'), as well as his characteristic absolutization of such concepts as 'genius', 'integrity of inspiration', 'the temple of people's life'. See Iskander in the interview with Shklovskii cited in n. 4, and Iskander's essays 'The Sincerity of Repentance Engenders the Energy of Inspiration' ('Iskrennost' pokaianiia porozhdaet energiiu vdokhnoveniia'), 'Mozart and Salieri', 'An Attempt to Understand Human Nature', 'A Word on Pushkin' ('Slovo o Pushkine'), in Rasskazy. Povest'. Skazka . . . 8 Speaking about A. N. Nekrasov, Dostoevskii elaborates: 'Nekrasov truly was an original to the highest degree and truly did come to us with his "new word"' (F. M. Dostoevsky, 'The Death of Nekrasov: On What Was Said at his Grave', in A Writer's Diary, trans. by Kenneth Lantz, 2 vols (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1997-99), 11, 1247.</page><page sequence="4">134 Indirection in Fazil' Iskander ethical position. Indeed, Iskander's work is marked with bold, yet somehow joyful, didacticism. By the mid-1960s many readers become weary of the self- irony introduced by the Thaw. They were, however, even more repelled by the aggressive moralizing characteristic of post-war socialist realism. After all, as Katerina Clark shows, post-war socialist realism shifted in focus from depicting epic heroes and their exploits to moralizing over 'lesser affairs' and 'the contest between the good and the excellent'.9 It should be noted that the somewhat af- fected pedantry of Iskander's mini-sermons parodies precisely this moralizing of latter-day socialist realism. Thus, irony is not absent from Iskander's writing; instead, it ceases to be the purpose of the utterance. The ironic and paradoxical didacticism of Iskander should be examined in the context of the 1960s' overall increased interest in the literary text as a technique.10 An analysis of the motives behind this renewed attention to poetics in Russia, however, is beyond the scope of this article. Suffice it to say that the works of the formalists were rediscovered, Mikhail Bakhtin's and Iurii Lotman's books were brought out, and those with interest in European post-structuralist theory were allowed to satisfy their curiosity. Both writers and readers were again fascinated by literature as an art form. The notorious question for grammar-school compositions, 'What did the author intend to say?', gained the pathos of intellectual communication between the writer as a mentor and the reader as a disciple. Chudakova believes that Iskander's individuality also emerges from the fact that he 'seeks to develop a "serious" authorial narrative, emanating directly from the author, without resorting to skaz or stylization'. *' It is useful to follow the critic's observation because her a contrario approach to Iskander, i.e. identifying his prose by what it is not and according to what elements it lacks, helps positively to define the author's narrative techniques: [Iskander's narrative voice] is free from those interminable glances back (at oneself or at oneself as seen by others, or at oneself at a not so distant younger age, ete.) which riddle the language of ironic prose. Similarly absent is a striking feature of that prose?the exaggerated insecurity of the narrator and the author in the 'appropriateness' of each word and their willingness readily to resign themselves to other stylistic strata.12 This is not exactly so. Iskander's narrator is constantly compelled to verify the accuracy of his childhood reminiscences, or, in retelling the adventures of Uncle Sandro, to doubt their integrity. Chudakova is correct in noting that measuring oneself against what one has been and against what one is now does not signify wavering in Iskander, but rather serves as a clarification of one's confidence in oneself. Iskander's grown-up narrator repeatedly notes that his present account accurately reproduces past thoughts or impressions, even 9 See Katerina Clark, 'Soviet Fiction since World War II', in The Soviet Novel: History as Ritual (Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 189-209. 10 For European literary studies of increased interest in poetics in the 1960s see R. Lach- mann, Demontazh krasnorechiia: ritoricheskaia traditsiia i poniatie poeticheskogo (St Petersburg: Akademicheskiiproekt, 2001), pp. 5-18 (translation from the German original, Die Zerstorung der schonen Rede: Rhetorische Tradition und Konzepte des Poetischen (Munich: Wilhelm Fink, 1994)). 11 Marietta Chudakova, Literatura sovetskogoproshlogo (Moscow: Iazyki russkoi kul'tury, 2001), p. 278. 12 Chudakova, p. 279.</page><page sequence="5">MARINA KANEVSKAYA 135 though his younger hero never put those impressions in quite the same way as the narrator presently deems appropriate: 'Of course, all this seemed very vague then, but I am convinced that now I am developing kernels of the very impressions I had then and not of different ones.'13 Indeed, Iskander simulates authorial uncertainty, parodying the self-irony of contemporary authors for whom it has become the norm. A frequently repeated authorial remark, 'as I now understand', plays another important role by creating a double-voiced utterance, a philosophical dialogue between the narrator as a child and now, in the narrative present. Although Iskander's characters, in particular the boy Chik, display developed skills of observation and self-reflection, the ultimate truth is formulated only in the author's analysis of their impressions, in his frequently aphoristic summary. This is also the case with Iskander's treatment of skaz and other possibilities for a stylized utterance which remain just possibilities. Failure of their real? ization is a distinctive feature of Iskander's prose, for he frequently renders not merely the vernacular, but the colourful, multilingual, variously accented chatter of multicultural mid-twentieth century Abkhazia. More often than not he stops short of reproducing these speech patterns, providing only a descrip? tive rendition, even though these renditions are loaded with possibilities that contribute to the narrative, enriching the stratum of the implied. This rejection of stylization (a 'minus-technique', to use the formalist term) reveals its moral and even political significance when placed in the context of the arch-rhetorical style of late socialist realism. The exotic (or regional) had no place in this context. Or, rather, the exotic had to be re-created in a prescribed manner. Thus, a person from the Caucasus was expected to speak in incomplete sentences, using awkward and idiosyncratic expressions. Images from rural life and supposedly national folklore also served as tropes of exotica. The speech of a positive character or a local sage would reach its culmination in a naive but impassioned recapitulation of a newspaper article, routinely coloured with slight grammatical inaccuracies. Socialist realist rhetoric ignored or compromised earlier rhetorical systems. Supported by the dominant military, economic, and political power, it viewed the space that it usurped as having previously possessed an inadequate? archaic, absurd, reactionary, or irrelevant?discourse. A dominant rhetoric usu? ally imposes its authority through the 'Roman' model, banishing the slightest manifestation of local rhetoric. Or it uses an updated tactic, admitting to the canon certain strictly regulated, and even provisionally created, surrogates for the genuine exotic. It is this latter approach that was adopted by socialist re? alism. Those newly manufactured elements that were admitted to the canon of regional exotica were stripped of their context; they came to play the role of 'defective informants' that discredited their underlying discourse. Crippled from the start, these elements could not dependably represent their original rhetoric, demeaning it in the shade of the dominant rhetoric, time and again confirming the alleged logic of the latter's total triumph. Iskander takes on this cultural policy, consistently avoiding exotic elements 13 Iskander, 'Shkol'nyi val's', in Sobranie sochinenii v chetyrekh tomakh [henceforth referred to as SS], 4 vols (Moscow: Molodaia gvardiia, 1991), 11, 147.</page><page sequence="6">136 Indirection in Fazil' Iskander not only in his narrative, but also in direct speech. And where the language or accent of the speaker has essential relevance, he explains those grammatical deviations. He rarely violates speech norms, and rather than introduce exotic speech elements, he prefers to treat these irregularities descriptively. He adopts a more complex approach, although using the same method of explanation, when introducing exotic Abkhazian customs to the reader. These detailed de? scriptions are directed at eliminating exoticisms (or, in this case, 'orientalisms') as well as creating a context for and, ultimately, asserting the authority of the regional rhetoric. For comparison we can cite two passages from the novel School Waltz (ShkoVnyi val's). In the first passage the speech of Ali Khan, the Persian, is reproduced literally: ?Ka&lt;?e-KOH/prrepcKH Meniairr?! . . . AAHxaH?aTanopK?! Fwje AAHxaH?ra^e aTanopK?! Tio3HaK Meniairr?! IHepGeT Meniairr?! CupvT Ha roAOBa?ne Meniairr?!?14 These instances of mimicking incorrect pronunciation are infrequent in Iskan? der. More often, he describes the accent: It seemed hilarious to us children when, in her account of this story, she tried to re- produce the terrible Mingrelian accent in his Russian. However, Mother's own Russian suffered from a terrible Abkhazian accent that was often a source of great amusement to us, yet she was giving a rendition of the principal's funny pronunciation assuming her own pronunciation to be the correct one, thus further distorting the principal's already disfigured language. All this was pretty amusing.15 This descriptive approach to language situations is one of Iskander's most fre- quent and productive features, creating a wide range of comic effects from light jokes to scathing satire. An illustration of the latter can be found in the story 'The Beginning' ('Nachalo'), where during an admissions interview a student adjusts the degree of his Abkhazian accent to the professor's expectations.16 Other situations where this trope appears include occasions when Iskander's narrator relates in his own words an actual or intended utterance of a character, even though the reader realizes that this character could not possibly deliver something of such lexical complexity or stylistic expressiveness. So in School Waltz, dim-witted Uncle Kolya is silently observing the antics of the drunken Uncle Samad, only waiting for a sign from grandmother to take him home: Uncle Kolia looked [. . .] as if he wished to settle this argument peacefully [. . .] Sure enough, he had not the remotest idea what the whole thing was about. With this in mind he was addressing Uncle [Samad]: you've been sort of drinking, you've been sort of unruly, but that's it, it's time to let people have their peace.17 Of course, poor Uncle Kolia could neither think nor verbalize anything of the kind. In fact, he does not say anything at all in this situation. Chudakova notes Iskander's 'crafty story' and his 'use of rhetoric devices, particularly congenial to oral storytelling', yet she goes on to add that the 14 SS, ii, 127. 15 SS, 11, 129. 16 SS, 1, 25. 17 SS, 11, 126 (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="7">MARINA KANEVSKAYA 137 'author's narrative has no sensitivity for the volatility of spoken language, fail- ing to reproduce it either in the characters' or in the author's narrative'.18 She argues that Iskander develops still unexhausted possibilities of normative liter? ary speech. We believe, however, that his artistic technique lies precisely in the duality of the dialogue dynamic and the rejection of the stylization of dialogue. Indeed, the utterance in Iskander is extremely sensitive to spoken language and gives its accurate psychological description, yet this utterance is not susceptible to the spoken language, rejecting simulation and mimicry. The Alaverdi Principle It appears that this pervasive dynamic of the leisurely dialogue, and not merely a dialogue but a measured Abkhazian feast, determines the modular composi? tion of Iskander's stories. In the story 'The Abduction, or the Riddle of the Endurians' ('Umykanie iii zagadka endurtsev') Uncle Sandro formulates the principle of this narrative, literally equating it with the course of life itself: 'How important it is in life for people to eat, drink, and listen to my stories mindfully and unhurriedly, and occasionally to add something, provided they have anything to add.'19 Likewise, Iskander's autobiographical character Zenon exemplifies the talent of oral storytelling: 'He was a natural raconteur, and the branching out of his stories only emphasized the authenticity of the tree of life he was describing.'20 The tree of life and the branching of narrative?these are the stylistic structures consciously exploited by the author. The logic of dialogue allows the narrator to digress incessantly from his story, prompted by mere word associations or situational overtones, to shorten or expand his tale, depending on the listeners' mood, to resume the initial plot, or to abandon it completely. As Natal'ia Ivanova notes, Iskander's narrative is never linear; it never follows a plot or storyline. The unity of the story is the? matic and ideological;21 the new links of branching stories and observations are designed to elaborate upon an idea or illustrate a situation, but these connec? tions can scarcely be seen as formal or utilitarian ones. The narrative exchange follows this eclectic, patchy pattern and is always dialogic in the very sense of the Bakhtinian term. A brief cultural digression is in order here. A traditional Abkhazian tableside conversation is propelled by an essentially free-form and open-ended toast. Generally, in Russian culture the notion of the Caucasus toast is a stereotype of sorts. An example of this finds its mocking representation in the famous film comedy The Captive of the Caucasus (Leonid Gaidai, Kavkazskaia plennitsa, 1966), where each of the re-created toasts finishes in a parable, with a clearly stated message. In a less grotesque variety, a Caucasus toast is a long address with all sorts of 'oriental' rhetorical embellishments. During the toast, all those gathered around the table remain silent, holding their glasses, goblets, and even 18 Chudakova, p. 277 (emphasis added). 19 Fazil' Iskander, Novye glavy 'Sandro iz Chegema' (Ann Arbor, MI: Ardis, 1981), p. 27. 20 'Utraty', in Stoianka cheloveka, p. 473. 21 Natal'ia Ivanova, Smekh protiv strakha, ili Fazil' Iskander (Moscow: Sovetskii pisatel', 1990), PP- 77-78, 86.</page><page sequence="8">138 Indirection in Fazil' Iskander wine horns ready and waiting until the ordeal is over. This cultural cliche is an example of an 'orientalism'. Perhaps the only toasts of this kind are delivered at official functions; commonly the ritual takes an entirely different form. The tamada (toastmaster)?usually the host or an honoured guest?initiates the toast. The selection ofthe tamada happens rather naturally and unobtrusively: one of those present simply understands that he should be the toastmaster. Yet, just a few moments into his speech someone feels compelled to add to the main toast, by way of recalling some didactic story or even redirecting the subject altogether, and the ensuing digressions from the toast constitute the table talk. Gradually, the toast is eroding, as it were, losing its initial impulse and breaking into individual voices and separate exchanges. At this point the tamada will propose a new toast, thus renewing the cycle of dialogue around the table. Sometimes, raising his toast the tamada alerts one of the guests with the phrase Alaverdi' ('to you'),22 thus indicating that the guest is expected to pick up and develop the proposed subject. Even Iskander's shortest stories, and not just his novels, are structured on the alaverdi principle. Methodologically, alaverdi can help in analysing Iskander's narrative dy? namic. Indeed, Iskander himself had noted: 'In general, I am a good story - teller.'23 He was not trying to be funny, for what he had in mind was not that he was a well-known author, but a veteran toast-giver. This was his way of indicating that the associative technique of the narrative that follows an oral model, or even a polyphonic dialogue, is used by him with full knowledge and serves specific goals.24 In Iskander one word transmits an associative signal to another word, ul? timately forming an entire story in which an idea echoes a similar idea, and a situation may call to mind a similar incident. This mixed unity as a whole supports the author's ethical argument and suggests that his utterance finds continual reinforcement in life experience. Examples of a story structured ac? cording to the alaverdi principle can be found in any Iskander text, not only in those dealing with feasts as such. As an example let us consider the first ten pages of School Waltz. In the first paragraph the reader learns of a family's decision to send a boy, the main character of the story, to school a year early. One of the obstacles preventing the implementation of this plan is the extremely poor performance of his older 22 The literal meaning of alaverdi in Turkish is 'God granted', but in the context of a Caucasus banquet it has become a signal meaning 'from me to you'. 23 Interview with Iskander by M. Kanevskaya, Moscow, January 2002. 24 Laura Beraha has examined at length the composition and genres of Iskander's narrative, concluding that the modular composition of his long cycles infuses the action with simultaneity and focuses the reader's attention on the conceptual significance of his works. See Laura Beraha, Compilation in the Art ofFaziV Iskander as a Key to 'Sandro iz Chegema' (Ann Arbor, MI: Disser? tation Abstracts International, 1992). This view helps penetrate the author's idea and appreciate his ingenuity. In contrast, an attempt to fit Iskander's narrative into traditional restrictive cate? gories of realism, such as 'plot' or 'psychological development of the character', limits the ability to grasp the author's design, which is what happened in Helen P. Burlingame's article 'The Prose of Fazil Iskander', Russian Literature Triquarterly, 14(1976), 123-65. Iskander's composition and genre have been explored by other scholars: Mark Lipovetsky suggests the term 'monumental short story, which would include a number of micro-novels which are variations of the main plot' (Mark Lipovetsky, ' "Znamenitoe chegemskoe lukavstvo": Strannaia idilliia Fazilia Iskandera', Kontinent, 103 (2000), 280-91 (p. 281).

This is illustrated by a separate account of his mockery of a teacher, a German, which is accompanied by a short note about the teacher. Then the narrative switches from the German teacher to other teachers' gen? eral complaints about his brother. The account of the teachers visiting his mother with their complaints calls to mind a theme of inquisitive neighbours, thus introducing the reader, without any transition, to Uncle Samad. Uncle Samad's story is linked to the narrative by two associative connections. He is frequently drunk and on his way home stops by the school in order to threaten the building (empty at this hour). This digression carries on the subject of ob- stacles keeping the boy out of school. Uncle Samad also engages in outrageous political arguments with the neighbours in the courtyard, which picks up the subject of inquisitive neighbours. The sketch involving Uncle Samad includes a maxim about poverty and wealth and a short reflection on clarity of mind and speech. Then the narrative takes a step back (marked by a pseudo-naive tran? sition '. . . And so, then'), allowing the boy to describe in detail one of Samad's verbal assaults on the school, and a frequent argument between Samad and his neighbour Samuil, a passionate reader of the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia. At the same time the boy relates his memory of having once solved Samuil's maths puzzle. The story of the constant debates between Uncle Samad and Samuil about whether Karaims are Jews opens the door to other characters: the boy's grandmother and his crazy Uncle Kolia, Samuil's wife, Ali Khan, the former owner of a pasty shop, and a whole clan of Georgian Jews who observe these debates from the window ofa house across the street. Each character has a brief history and is given direct or indirect lines. From the day that the boy solved Samuil's maths puzzle, his family and the neighbours believed in his genius. Thus, from Samuil and his puzzle the narrative comes back to the family's decision to send the boy to school a year early. 'And so', the boy and his mother go to the school. But even though this is the main line of the story, it is imme? diately interrupted by additional examples ofthe principal's irritation with the boy's family caused by the poor performance of his brother. This digression is enhanced by the anecdote about the principal's Mingrelian and mother's Abk? hazian accents. Then follows a short sketch ofthe principal's funny appearance and clumsiness. And so, that was the director that my mother and I went to',25 a statement that takes the reader back to the initial subject of going to the school. The composition of this ten-page excerpt is typical of Iskander. The passage encompasses at least twenty individual topics, each introducing either a new story or a new character with a brief biographical note or other information. Furthermore, transitions from one story to the next, departures and anticipa- tory pieces are introduced by short connectors: '. . . And so, then', 'Once', 'Incidentally', 'By the way', 'Interestingly', 'But we have digressed from our story', 'This whole story had an additional funny aspect', ete.?which occa? sionally help explain the need for such narrative skipping, but often just parody an explanation. In Iskander a short story is no longer an 'incident' or an 'anec- 25 SS, 11, p. 130.</page><page sequence="10">14-0 Indirection in FaziV Iskander dote'; it is contextualized, occupying a specific point in the tangle of people and events and capturing what might be called the spirit of the times. The dynamic of an open-ended toast or a tableside dialogue is not only reflected in the meandering logic of one of Iskander's stories, but it permeates the stylistic level of the discourse as well. Iskander notes how characters speak, reports their facial expressions and postures, what gestures accompany their words, and even how eloquent their silence is. One of the features of an oral story is the acting out of roles and situations, imitating gestures and voices, completing the thoughts of other people, and so on. Eloquent Gesture As was noted earlier, Iskander, when depicting speech peculiarities, does not imitate them but provides a somewhat restrained and jocularly reasonable ana? lysis, thus creating sometimes a purely comic effect and sometimes a didactic dialogism. In the story 'The Prince of Oldenburg' the author largely refrains from imitating his characters' accent, whether that ofthe German Prince, San- dro's Abkhazian pronunciation, or any peculiarities ofthe translator's language. Instead, he draws the reader into the psychology of this dialogue. The psycho? logical aspect is reinforced by the accompanying description of the characters' gestures, postures, and glances: 'How did it happen?' the Prince asked,26 stooping forward and examining Uncle Sandro from under his brows. This habit lent his figure a threatening impulsiveness and im- pressed upon his interlocutors the need to get to the truth by the shortest path possible. Uncle Sandro understood this immediately.27 But gradually 'Uncle Sandro's brazen appeal grew on the Prince', and this shows in Oldenburg's gestures and postures: from his irritated poking of Uncle Sandro's sack with his cane to his 'leaning back on the bench and looking at Uncle Sandro benevolently, as if allowing him to lengthen the path to the truth somewhat'.28 Thus, the Prince's gestures and postures attest to the triumph of Uncle Sandro's eloquence better than words, which become inadequate under the circumstances. Sandro and the Prince speak through an interpreter, who in his turn does not dare to translate Sandro's story verbatim, resulting in an even more lengthy and confused path to the truth. The comic aspect of the conversation is augmented by the fact that Sandro does actually understand Russian and grasps the grotesque nature of the whole situation. This short story, in which Uncle Sandro catches the Prince's black swan and 'presents' it to him, is reminiscent of a plot of a stock picaresque tale: a rogue not only escapes unpunished but is rewarded for his resourcefulness, while a high and mighty fool finds delight in his own self-importance.29 This traditional message is, however, not articulated but rather dramatized through the narrative device of analytically describing gestures and facial expressions, 26 Note that the Prince speaks with an 'aristocratic German accent'. 27 Sandro iz Chegema, pp. 45, 58 {Sandro of Chegem, pp. 43, 46). 28 Sandro iz Chegema, p. 59 {Sandro of Chegem, p. 476). 29 Mark Lipovetsky views the picaresque character of Sandro as reflecting 'the national life in the era of historic insanity' ('Znamenitoe chegemskoe lukavstvo', pp. 281-82).</page><page sequence="11">MARINA KANEVSKAYA 141 broken Russian, or a complete refusal to speak that language, as well as other non-verbal expressions.30 Iskander's common method for gradually uncovering essential meaning and creating his own 'path to the truth' consists in a comical and often exaggerated analytical description of a gesture or facial expression. For instance, the 'Story about the Sea' ('Rasskaz o more') mesmerizes the reader with its powerful description of a boy's love for the sea. This lyrical attitude is abruptly broken, however, when the boy suddenly realizes that he is drowning. Seeing a young man not far away on the pier, the boy attempts to summon help, without using words but through his facial expression. The boy is concerned that the well- dressed man may not wish to ruin his freshly pressed white shirt and nice shoes in order to rescue him: 'It's me, it's me!' I felt like shouting. 'I just swam past you, you must remember me!' I even tried to compose my face, fearing that my agitation and panic had so terribly disfigured it that the young man would not recognize me. But now that he did, I somehow reconciled myself to drowning and stopped resisting the water which closed in above my head.31 Iskander's persistent scrutinizing ofthe boy's facial expression gradually yields a deeper significance of the ostensibly trivial situation. The young man even? tually sacrifices his clothes in order to jump into the water and to save the boy. However, the analysis of the boy's facial expression shifts the focus of the nar? rative from the trivial glorification ofthe brave rescuer to the boy's uncertainty that his life merits the ruining of a freshly pressed shirt. Focusing on detail such as the boy's silent cry for help, Iskander portrays an existence ruled by scarcity and need in which ruining a nice outfit to save another life becomes an altruistic if not altogether heroic act. The story reveals an additional level of this descriptive approach. The alter- nating lyricism and irony of the narrative imply a continuous nostalgic dialogue between the narrator as he is now and as he was in childhood. The main point ofthe story is not the boy's panic or the young man's noble act; rather it creates a general sense of joy and unique childhood experiences. Iskander's interpretation of gestures incorporates three levels of awareness: a character does one thing while his mind is occupied with something else, and the author possesses the key to what these thoughts and actions represent on the innermost level. In the Russian tradition this device originated with Tolstoi: in War and Peace the lady-in-waiting Anna Pavlovna Scherer engages in the conversation about the war with Napoleon, playfully disguising her ignorance with an amiable smile, which Tolstoi explains as follows: To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did 30 Many scholars have observed the complexity of gestures, postures, inarticulate interjections of Iskander's characters. Thus, for instance, Mark Lipovetsky discusses the gesture the father makes in the story 'Forbidden Fruit' {Zapretnyi plod) in his article 'Usloviia igry' ('Rules ofthe Game'), Literaturnoe obozrenie, 7 (1988), 46-49. Benedikt Sarnov, 'Chem glubzhe zacherpnut": zametki o proze Fazilia Iskandera', Voprosy literatury, 7 (1978), 126-51, writes of the link between this trope and the formalist theory of 'defamiliarization'. Comic 'decoding' of gestures is discussed by Sergei Ivanov, 'O "maloi proze" Iskandera , iii Chto mozhno sdelat' iz nastoiashcheimukhi', Novyimir, 1 (1989), 252-56. See also Ivanova, Smekh protiv strakha, pp. 122-23, 129, 139, et passim. 31 SS, 1, 44.</page><page sequence="12">142 Indirection in FaziV Iskander not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappbint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.32 Iskander resorts to this device with full awareness of the literary precedent and treats it with irony. He delves into a seemingly trivial situation and reveals its astonishing complexity of explicit and implicit thoughts and emotions, showing at the same time that this complexity is related exclusively to the verbalization of the situation, while on the level of life experiences it presents no mystery and is clear to everyone. For an example of this let us turn again to the beginning of School Waltz: the mother brings the boy to school, where, as they expected, the administration is reluctant to admit him. The boy and his mother decide to wait it out on the front porch. The boy starts reading aloud from a textbook he has brought, in the hope of impressing the teachers who pass by them: I must honestly admit that my mother and I did not discuss this plan in advance [. . .] So, I began reading aloud, noticing out of the corner of my eye that she looked at me approvingly. I could tell this by her deepened sorrowful look. That expression appeared on her face whenever she spoke about my father or had to visit some governmental office [. . .] Presently her dejected expression was supposed to give a sorrowful contrast to my brilliant performance. Her countenance was not completely dishonest but, as I understand now, indicated an immersion into the rut of [. . .] hopelessness [. . .] The expression of sorrowful helplessness on my mother's face was so persistent that it almost suggested the solution for those who find it annoying and would like to get rid of it: Do what I want and you would never see it again.33 This illustrates Iskander's allegiance to Tolstoi's tradition. With affected ruth- lessness the narrator exposes the comic characteristics of the mother, who is essentially a positive character.34 However, whereas Tolstoi supplies a moraliz- ing message, Iskander treats the thought with irony, leaving it unfinished. When he does provide an instructive summary, his aphoristic manner is rooted in the logic of an image or an association and stops short of completing the thought. Iskander's didactic interpretations acquire a philosophical dimension. A naive character comes across as a much happier and wiser creature than the worldly narrator with his bitter truths. When the author articulates his indis- putable opinion, the reader invariably gets the impression that his ultimate wisdom has lost the buoyancy of a direct impression and the path to the truth was gruelling and cheerless. Thus, Iskander arrives at some ominous conclusions about the passivity and inertia of the crowd faced with an aggressive evil. In School Waltz the boy 32 Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace, trans. by Leo Wienner, 2 vols (Boston, MA: Ester, 1904), 1, 5. ? SS, 11, 137, 144- 34 Iskander writes about the mother:' In this world where duty, honour, and conscience were long forgotten, she was unswervingly waging her great tiny war with the chaos of egotism, alienation, desecration of that sacred God's gift?shame. She was labouring to bring up all of us, her children, but she was also doing her best to preserve the living ties that kept our beehive clan together. But it was becoming increasingly difficult to keep it together' ('Bol'shoi den' bol'shogo doma' ('The Big Day of the Big House'), in Iskander, Zashchita Chika. Rasskazy ipovesti (Moscow: Sovetskii pisatel', 1983), p. 223.</page><page sequence="13">MARINA KANEVSKAYA 143 describes a gathering of men watching a rowdy drunk: 'The duality of our role was that, on the one hand, we [. . .] disapproved of his behaviour, but on the other, became a dutiful audience for his antics and in that capacity undoubtedly encouraged him, as if saying: "Come on! Show us more of this!"'35 Things get serious when a stone hits the boy on the head. Yet remarkably, this accident does not prompt the crowd to act, but only redirects its conscience to another level of rationalization: now that the boy is injured it is too late to do anything: 'With their poses they were trying to say, "Here we are, standing as before, and we are not doing anything to avoid the stones, but we also are not doing anything so that one hits us. As you can see, we play fair."'36 Iskander exposes the cowardly nature of the majority passively watching an aggressor who occupies a weak position, at least for the time being. Iskander compares the attitude of the crowd with the foreign policy of the European countries on the eve of the Second World War, 'when everybody was trying to appease Hitler, while their political fascination with his bloody affairs was actually provoking him further'.37 The majority displays its cowardice by being unwilling to interfere simply because the stone does not hit the main group of grown-up men, but only a boy standing nearby. This allows the majority to interpret the assault as directed elsewhere and thus not malicious but possibly accidental and possibly provoked by the victim. An interesting example of the analytical description of a gesture is the ex- panded demetaphorization of an idiom. Thus, in School Waltz Iskander in- terprets the set phrase 'to wink at somebody' (in the sense of a commonly understood implied alternative meaning) as a physical act of winking. The nar? rator recalls how the 1939 pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, when Stalin abruptly abandoned the anti-Fascist cause, puzzled everyone not just by its inexplicability, but also by the Soviet leadership's failure to explain this poli? tical turnaround, something which demonstrated the utter cynicism of Stalin's tyranny. Nervous and embarrassed, a teacher informs the class, again with no explanation, that from now on they should not use the politically derogatory term 'Fascist'. Assuming some sort of hidden meaning, 'a checkmate to the capitalists of the world',38 the students pretended that they could appreciate Stalin's scheming: 'We acted as if we were winking at each other with reference to that pact, not realizing that the man who endorsed it on our behalf, or at least on behalf of all of our adult relatives, did not give us any reason to wink at his actions, nor was he winking at anyone himself, at least not in this sense.'39 Interpretation of gestures, stares, and facial expressions becomes even more important in connection with Stalin. Iskander closely scrutinizes the image of Stalin that he creates, as well as the dictator's aura of almost mystical evil. The author strips Stalin's sinister thought of worn-out and unremarkable words, forcing it to surface in a gesture or a stare. In the story 'Belshazzar's Feasts', the singing and dancing of an Abkhazian folk group are described analytically. 35 SS, 11, 138-39. 36 SS, 11, 138-39. 37 SS, 11, 138-39. 38 SS, 11, 210. 39 SS, 11, 210.</page><page sequence="14">144 Indirection in FaziV Iskander The analysis sees their performance as an artistic expression, which re-creates an epic about a battle, death of a hero, and a mother's lament.40 As he watches the group's performance, Stalin is swept by memories, and although his thought moves in the direction set by the artists, it opposes the performance in the way that death opposes life. After the performance Stalin treats the dancers to fried chicken. Impatiently he tears the chicken apart, grease dripping from his fingers. Iskander creates this image without comments, thus suggesting both a literal and an Aesopian (subversively allegorical) interpretation. The more obvious allegory here would be that Stalin tears the country apart and blood is dripping from his hands.41 Yet explicitly the scene has a much more powerful impact: the ruler of an enormous empire handles his food like a barbarian, embarrassing the Abkhazian dancers. Essentially the story presents the struggle between life and death, where the former is dynamic and vulnerable and the latter is aggressive and insidious. Thus, Uncle Sandro escapes death only because of his legendary cunning and his unfailing talent for quickly solving fate's treacherous riddles. It is in contrast to Stalin that the picaresque image of Uncle Sandro is filled with philosophical life-affirming meaning. Many critics have noted that Uncle Sandro embodies the people. He is neither good nor bad, as a people cannot be good or bad. But a people can withstand just about any ordeal, just as Uncle Sandro does, dying, as the narrator assumes, a natural death of old age.42 The story 'Belshazzar's Feasts' ends with a hilarious description of Uncle Sandro's enigmatic gaze, which through extensive analysis gradually gains a truly historical significance. After the Twentieth Party Congress (at which Nikita Khrushchev 'exposed' Stalin) Uncle Sandro often told anyone willing to listen about his encounter with Stalin. As a little boy Sandro saw Stalin escaping from the police through the Caucasus mountains. Stalin spared the boy's life because he did not want to be delayed and the boy, terrified by Stalin's ruthless expression, concealed from the police the true direction of his flight: Saying this, Uncle Sandro would gaze at his companion, his big eyes tinged with mysticism. His gaze made it plain that, had he told his father at the right time about the man who passed on the lower Chegem road, all of world history would have taken a different path, in any case not the lower Chegem path. All the same, it was not exactly clear whether he regretted his silence or expected a reward from the none-too-grateful younger generation. Most likely his gaze meant that while he regretted he had not told his father, he would not be averse to receiving a reward. Then again, this ambiguity in his gaze implied a dose of demonic irony, which seemed to reflect the confusion and vacillation of the earthly judges who tried to penetrate its meaning.43 This example clearly demonstrates Iskander's playful treatment of his own pur- portedly exhaustive explanations of gazes and gestures. Uncle Sandro, whose gaze was subjected to a detailed, conclusive study, ultimately also looks at his critics and lauerhs at their oerceptiveness. 4?

The author provides the final formulation of the message which frequently escapes the characters and the narrator. Thus, Uncle Sandro hints at the parallelism of his and Stalin's characters. The narrator also uses the comic aspects of this parallelism, calling Uncle Sandro 'the greatest toastmaster [tamada] of all times and nations',44 which parodies Stalin's ornate titles 'the father of all nations' and 'the greatest leader of all time'. Sandro often pontificates that Stalin too might have become a pretty fair tamada had he not been so busy with politics. At this point Uncle Sandro paused and looked slyly at everybody [. . .] as if trying to see if the implications of his hint reached his listeners [. . .] Tengiz [. . .] asked him: 'So, does it mean that if you had not spent so much time at the table you could have become a great leader?'45 In his interpretation of Uncle Sandro's hint, his friend Tengiz unwittingly uncovers its hidden meaning. By spelling out what Sandro had only implied Tengiz satirizes Sandro's very attempt at this hidden meaning, as well as his incredulous look at his innocent audience. In effect, Tengiz tells Sandro that if he had not wasted all his time in drinking, he could have become somebody. Iskander's irony pursues this path of pessimism further and lets the reader see in Sandro's clever look his inability to perceive the tragedy of what he had said: if Stalin had spent more time in simple human pleasures and used his organizational genius as a tamada, the world would have been a much better place. Anthropomorphism: Animals and Nature Iskander pays attention not only to human expressions, but also to those of animals. Animal sounds are interpreted in ways similar to the treatment of hu? man exclamations. For example, in the story An Evening Road' ('Vecherniaia doroga'), the idea of a city boy's complex encounter with nature is presented through an interpretation of his interaction with goats. During the war the boy's family was forced to leave Mukhus and stay with his mother's relatives in various remote villages. The boy is faced with a double challenge: he must adapt to a life without his mother and acquire some rural skills, such as shep- herding goats: Gradually I learnt to impose my will on this small but unruly herd. We were commu- nicating by two ancient magical exclamations: 'Kheit!' and 'JioP These exclamations had multiple shades of meaning depending on how they were pronounced. The goats understood them perfectly but sometimes, when it suited them, they pretended that they confused various meanings. These meanings were really multiple. For example, when pronounced with a drawl, freely and expansively?'Kheit! Kheit!'?it meant: 'Go, graze in peace, you are in no danger.' The same commands pronounced with a kind of didactic reproach meant: 'I can see where you are trying to turn.' And if said suddenly and quickly, 'Jio! JioF meant 'Danger! Come back!' The skilful combination of these 44 'Belshazzar's Feasts', Sandro iz Chegema, p. 223 {Sandro of Chegem, p. 199). 45 'Uncle Sandro and his Pet' ('Diadia Sandro i ego liubimets'), Sandro iz Chegema, pp. 303-04 {Sandro of Chegem, p. 262).</page><page sequence="16">146 Indirection in FaziV Iskander exclamations produced many varieties of educational value: an order, advice, warning, and reproach. When hearing my voice, the goats would raise their heads as if trying to comprehend what exactly they were expected to do this time.46 Through an ironic double-voiced discourse the adult narrator articulates one of Iskander's defining ideas about the unity of man and nature. His endow- ment of animals and nature with human attitudes and even language points to the fact that, in Iskander's universe, nature replaces religion. The unity of children, animals, and nature creates an epically idyllic world in Iskander's art. The interaction between these agents always occurs at the intuitive, visual, and emotional level. In the story An Evening Road', the boy walks in the dark and fails into an open grave. There he finds a goat, which had earlier fallen into the same grave. The boy overcomes his fear of the goat and the dark cemetery, embraces the goat, and relaxes in the warmth of another living creature. Na- tal'ia Ivanova argues that in Iskander contact with the animal world is 'always beneficial for humans and helps bring out their superior moral traits'.47 Accord? ing to Iskander, humans are able to understand the consciousness of animals when they carefully observe their movements and listen to their sounds. All those non-verbal expressions receive a strictly anthropomorphic interpretation which teaches people to love animals as one loves oneself. This is the essence of the imaginary dialogues between Chik and the dogs in 'The Night and Day of Chik' ('Noch' i den' Chika'); the sense of responsibility for the task which unites a boy and a donkey in the story 'First Task' ('Pervoe delo'); the mutual respect between Kiazym and his horse Kukla in 'Uncle Kiazym's Horse' ('Loshad' diadi Kiazyma'); and the mystical connection of the hunter Shchaadad with wildlife in 'Losses'. The sacral meaning of human sympathy with animals is revealed in the story 'The Big Day ofthe Big House', when Kama (Sandro's younger sister and the mother of the boy who narrates the story) watches a hen gathering its chicks: Every time she saw one chick after another disappearing under the warm wings of the hen, Kama felt that an inexplicable miracle had occurred before her eyes. She had not understood yet that nothing in the world is more accommodating than the wings of love. But even without understanding, the sight before her eyes of the hen sheltering her chicks under her wings was exciting, as if in anticipation of the feast of life.48 Interpreting Kama's reaction, the author refers directly to an Evangelical metaphor: 'How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings.'49 In Iskander, comparison of a person with an animal usually elevates the former. For example, in his short novel Goatibex Constellation a reporter arrives at a collective farm to cover the breeding of goatibex, a hybrid of a goat and buffalo. The peasants, of course, cannot openly protest against this new project, but their ironic indifference is obvious in their gestures and attitudes: At the table on my left a fat unshaven peasant was dozing. Sensing that someone had 46 In Iskander, Zapretnyiplod.

It reminded me of a napping cat that upon hearing the clatter of dishes half opens its eye, but upon realizing that the clatter is not related to meal time, goes back to sleep.50 The point of comparing a napping man with a cat is not limited to the most obvious or situational similarity. This trope helps create a more significant satirical utterance. The reporter?an idler in the eyes of the peasants?came to write about the goatibex, another meaningless 'project', which could only make life on the collective farm more difficult. Frustrated and weary from the prevailing madness, the peasant closes his eyes when he sees the reporter. The cat comparison adds a new dimension to this tragicomic situation, for it shows the animal's wise practical attitude. The story as a whole tells how people have lost the ability to recognize the difference between reality and fantasy. Comparison between the peasant and the cat elevates the peasant and at the same time brings his response closer to the intuitively rational reaction of an animal. Interpretation of symbolism in nature is directly related to the interpretation of animal behaviour.51 This artistic device is used to represent the connection between a boy and the sea ('Story about the Sea' and 'Tea Party and the Love of the Sea' ('Chaepitie i liubov' k moriu')), between a boy and a pear tree (School Waltz), between the Svanetians and a mountain lake ('Sacred Lake' ('Sviatoe ozero')). Anthropomorphism and the sacralization of nature are most obvious in the symbolism of the ancient walnut tree in the final part of the Chegem cycle, 'Tree of Childhood' ('Derevo detstva'). The mythology of this ancient walnut serves as a metaphor of folk life, a symbol of time and enduring values that can be destroyed neither by people nor by celestial forces. The narrator sees in the image of the tree a symbol of potential development for both individuals and the people as a whole: I love trees. I feel that a tree is one of the most noble creatures of nature. Sometimes I think that a tree is not just a noble design of nature but a design meant to show us the desirable form of our soul, that is the form that allows us to hold fast to the earth, yet to rise to the skies without fear. The peaceful power of a tree teaches us kindness and generosity [. . .] I have liked many trees over the course of my life and now, having reached a mature age, I have most tender memories about them [. . .] But above all others I loved the walnut tree growing in the Sabid valley. It was a gigantic tree with a huge hollow [. . .] It seemed that no earthly or celestial forces were able to kill that mighty walnut. It continued to live and bring forth its fruit, and the peasants who lived in the vicinity called it the prayer tree and brought it offerings.52 When Iskander defines the goal of his major work, Sandro of Chegem, as a depiction of 'the power and the beauty of the moral sky under which the people of Chegem lived',53 he takes an element of nature?the sky?as the symbol of his people's moral wholesomeness. The organic harmony between the people and 50 SS, ii, 47-48. 51 See Boris Briker and Per Dal'gor, 'Sandro iz Chegema i magicheskii realizm Iskandera', Scando-Slavica, 30 (1984), 103-15 (pp. 111, 113).

Conclusions Iskander's manner of storytelling is reflective of his philosophical outlook on life. Dwelling on such commonplace elements as the look of a child, the raised ear of a dog, the exclamation of a madman, the roots and branches of a tree, and similar items which usually do not receive such elaborate treatment, Iskander conducts an implicit rhetorical campaign in order to demonstrate that they have no less meaning than the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact or Stalin's toasts. Iskander's patient and even compassionate attention to the process of or? dinary people's intuitive perception of the world reflects in some paradoxical way his scepticism towards the notion of progress, whether the technological achievements of humankind as a whole, or the maturity of an individual.55 De? picting life in its various visual, aural, and other perceptible manifestations, he emphasizes that it is beyond the reach of the explicatory effect of words, thus giving his own explanations a comic, self-parodying touch. For Iskander, to comprehend and generalize a life phenomenon, to destroy its auspicious am? biguity, and to reveal its rational framework always means to compromise its spontaneity. In the story 'Losses' a character tells about gradually drawing away from his birthplace in the mountainous village Chegem. First the family moves to the valley town, Mukhus, and later he leaves permanently for Moscow, that 'valley of valleys'. The title of the story?'Losses'?refers to the death of the narrator's sister, but not just that, as the title clearly includes multiple tragedies. Indeed, his sister's death brings to his memory her words about another loss: 'We should not have left our village . . . This was a mistake . . ,'56 Similarly, as the 'highlands' were lost, so the intuitive element disappeared under the pressure of education and life experience. Iskander, of course, is aware that it is impossible to recapture ignorance and inexperience, but one can describe the progression towards knowledge at the stage when this process was still giving joy: 'Chik felt that ignorance makes them [children] more carefree and happy, just as knowledge makes people more vulnerable. Chik knew it. Or rather, he knew it but was not aware that he knew it.'57 Narrative techniques at all levels, from non-linear composition to the concern with non-verbal elements, re-create the process of the empirical acquisition of truth. Iskander is aware of the irony of these artistic devices. Remarks such as 'But we have digressed from our story', in stories which are nothing but one continuous 'digression', show the reader the witty design proposed by a 54 'Utraty', in Stoianka cheloveka, p. 472. 55 See e.g. An Attempt to Understand Human Nature': 'The idea of progress as a historic objective has exhausted itself. Technical improvements of life will continue, yet no reasonable person will believe that technology will ever lead to a moral breakthrough' (Rasskazy. Povest'.
