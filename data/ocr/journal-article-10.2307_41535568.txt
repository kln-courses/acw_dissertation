<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ovid's Wavering Identity : Personification and Depersonalisation in the Exilic Poems (*) Ovid's Metamorphoses has, as its essential theme, the depersonalisation of human beings into other forms. This depersonalisation deals in impossibility and requires a suspension of belief in the rational, in both poet and reader. The exiled poet himself frequently speaks of the work as his poem on mutatae ... formae (!), in which he appears not wholly to believe (2). He appears in T. 4.7. 1 1-20 to call into question the concept of metamorphosis in an excursive áôvvarov featuring topics taken from the Metamorphoses , "which he would as lief believe than ...". When the poet is required to "believe in" his own exile, exile shares in the incredible aspect of metamorphosis. Exile is an áôvvarov that has come to pass, as the poet explains in P. 4.3.5 1-54. In his loss of the opportunity for participation in Roman urban life, this most urbane of poets experiences his own metamorphosis into an outcast as a form of depersonalisation, a concept inherent in the formal Roman terminology for the loss of civil status preceding exile, capitis diminutio (3). The complement or reverse of depersonalisation is personification, which involves another aspect of impossibility : the "humanising" of either animals or inanimate objects. Suspension of disbelief is here of equal importance. Personification is a literary device which, like the áôvvarov , involves a blurring of limits, in this case, between man and animal, animate and inanimate, author and works, or creator and created, even between concrete and abstract. All personification of the non-human is essentially an áôvvarov , of a kind, that has come to pass. Like the true áôvvarov , (*) Gratitude is expressed to the University of Stellenbosch for sabbatical leave in 1985, and to the Universities of Texas at Austin, USA, and Cambridge, England, for hospitality to a visiting scholar, and the use of their extensive library facilities.

It can be used to convey either playful humour or pathos. The humorous aspect of personification is not very obvious in the exilic works. For the exiled poet, personification offers a useful means of conveying the pathos of his psychological reaction to loneliness. The exile turns to inanimate objects, which he imbues with human qualities, for lack of real human contact. It should, however, be emphasized that the poeťs sense of humour did not absolutely desert him at the moment of his departure for Tomis and that a sense of fun sometimes influenced his use of the device, as will emerge from discussion below. J.-M. Frécaut considers personification to be an important source of Ovidian humour and wit (4). When either nature or inanimate objects are not fully personalised, but human feeling, particularly sympathy, is imputed to them, one speaks of the "pathetic fallacy", that is, the fallacious impression that nature is sentient and concurs with the subject of emotion in his grief or joy. In the early Roman culture, with its animistic and numinous conception of nature and the forces of nature, the awareness of these forces as sentient was perhaps stronger and more ubiquitous than in the Greek anthropomorphic system of belief, which involved a clearer distinction between the human and non-human, and a more definite stepping-over of the limit. Hermann Fränkel in 1945 (Sather lectures) (5) coined an extremely apposite phrase, "wavering identity", for Ovid's multivalent presentation of the self in his poetry. Although Fränkel's imputation to our poet of an almost Christian awareness of the other , the non-self, may largely be discounted, the term is a useful critical tool for one's attempts to pin down, and even label, aspects of a particularly elusive poeťs multi-faceted self-awareness in his poetry. The most extensively worked-out conceit, involving such "wavering", in his earlier poetry, occurs in Am. 2. 15, a charming and witty poem in which the lover wishes that he could become his gift, a ring, but playfully depicts himself as retaining his most apposite human quality, his virility (6). Here the interchange of identities involves the personification of the ring and the depersonalisation of the lover. This paper will examine Ovid's exhibition, in the exilic poetry, of a "wavering identity", that is, his use of related literary devices, personification and depersona- lisation, to convey his psychological reaction to exile. It will try to establish to what degree the exiled poet either personifies the non-human, or depersonalises himself in his self-depiction. As far as possible, chronology will be taken into account for establishing whether the passage of the eight years or so of exile (A.D. 8/9 to the poet's death in about 17) made any difference in the poet's use of these comple- (4) J.-M.

Lawrence, op. cit [n. 4], considers that Ovid intends, with his extensive use of personification, to parody the love elegy, the elegiac lover, and himself as the elegiac poet in Am. 1 , 12,2.6,2.15 and 3.7.</page><page sequence="3">104 J.-M. CLAASSEN mentary devices. Insofar as the application of such statistics is valid, it is noteworthy that personification appears to be increasingly applied from the first book of the Tris tia to the last book of the Epistolae ex Ponto. This increase is from an average of about 1,4 occurrences per hundred verses to something in the order of 3,5 occurrences (7). 1 . Degrees in conceptualisation of personification There are distinct degrees in the conceptualisation of personification. As a specialised form of personification, apostrophe of the non-human can often be seen to be no more than a useful means of plastic scene-setting. Often the tendency to apply to non-human objects the nouns, adjectives and verbs that usually pertain to human functions, can be considered as a mere extension of metaphor, or non-literal diction. Such "personification" is purely ornamental. It lends itself to vivid or pathetic depiction and has no wider symbolic outreach. Such transposition of diction to the non-human may be termed "petrified personification". An attractive example is to be found at T. 3.12.9, 10 where the poet speaks of the swallow building its "cradle" {cunas). At P. 2.1.36 rocks are depicted graphically as "blushing" with roses (8). A bold application of a "human" adjective serves as ornament, but can also add graphic point, as with peregrinis columnis for "imported marble" at T. 3.1.61 in the description of the temple of Apollo on the Palatine. It supports the sense of Barbarus... pater. More complete personification is involved in the conceit at T. 5.5.39, 40 where even the smoke of their funeral pyre was depicted as divided, to show the continued enmity of the two Theban brothers. Such a conceit, in an apparently pathetic context, strikes one as rather contrived, and serves to detach the modern reader. Typically Ovidian wit here appears a little out of place. The examples quoted above fall in the category of "ornamental flourish". Ovid's functional use of the device falls into two broad categories relating to the central themes of exile. There is, on the one hand, the consistent picture of malevolent nature conspiring in support of the human forces of oppression against the exile. Here the pathetic fallacy is almost consistently negative. On the other hand, literature (7) See Jo-Marie Claassen, Poeta, exsul, vates : A Stylistic and Literary Analysis of Ovid's Tristia and Epistolae Ex Ponto , Diss. Stellenbosch, 1986, Section 8.3, for further statistics. This work will hereafter be referred to by author and date. The poet's use of personification in his earlier elegiacs is well-known. Fluctuations in its application would bear examination in an overall assessment of the poet's total œuvre. (8) Other examples of "petrified personification" occur at T. 3.12.7, 8 ; P. 1.2.84 ; 1.8.47 (also w. 55, 60) ; 2.7.10 ; 2.9.31 ; 3.1.23-26. The metonymy involved in using the name of a god for his or her sphere of influence is "personification" of a similar ornamental kind, as in T. 4.5.4 infusa Pallade , for "oil". The use of the convention (T. 4.10.56; 5.2.69; P. 1.10.29 (also w. 33, 34) ; 4.7.14) is probably dictated by exigency of metre.</page><page sequence="4">OVID'S WAVERING IDENTITY 1 05 and the exile's own mental powers each take on an independent personality. Here the poet wavers between identification with and consolation by these "independent personalities". Personified objects act alternately as his surrogates or his compa- nions. In the degree to which poet and poetry merge, the poet undergoes a process of depersonalisation. 2. The personification of aspects of exile The poetry of exile exhibits many of the typical characteristics of elegy, in a new setting. Conventional topoi such as personifications of dolor, ira, decor, timor ; and cura appear in passing (9). More important and consistent are the several occur- rences of liuor, where the concept takes on the malevolent personality of a human oppressor. Liuor is traditionally the carping Envy that tries to suppress the poet's voice (10). The personification may here be veiled metonymy for the poet's imperial persecutors. Liuor may be scanned as the prosodie equivalent of both Caesar and Liuia. Ovid elsewhere shows a fondness for paranomasia. It is not impossible that the poet intended deliberately to echo the first syllable of Liuia and to suggest the emperor's name by means of consonantal homoteleuton. A positive quality may also be personified. A particularly striking usage occurs at T. 1.3.85 : Pietas haec mihi Caesar eriu the departing exile's wife urges when she wants to accompany him. Here the process of personification is complex. "Caesar" has been depersonalised to an abstraction, necessity or force. The equation of pietas as a virtue with an impersonal force has in its turn been personified by the introduction of the emperor's name. Other personified virtues are gloria, uoluntas, facundia, gratia, uoluptas, uirtus(n). Youth, age, times and seasons have traditionally lent themselves to personifica- tion, and the first two give no great impression of novelty in the exilic oeuvre (12). The poet's treatment of time is, however, often strongly personified. In T. 1.3 the moon indicates both timeless serenity and the passage of time on the night of the exile's departure. Here time is marked by reference to personified celestial and (9) Dolor : T. 4.9.8 ; P. 1.10.23 ; ira : T. 4.9.10 ; decor : P. 2.3.13, 14 ; timor : P. 2.3.88 ; cura : P. 2.4.4. (10) Walter Wimmel in Hermes Einzelschr., vol. XVI, 1960, discusses the Latin poets' imitation of the Callimachean recusationary stance, which includes apostrophe of, and final triumph over, Envy. See discussion in Claassen (1986), Sections 5.2.1, 7.3 and 9.4.10. At P. 3.3.101, 102 the reference to Liuor is casual and gnomic. It serves, however, to round out the ultimate picture of the malevolence of Liuor ; which culminates at P. 4.16.47-52. (11) Gloria : P. 1.5.57 ; uoluntas : P. 2.5.31; facundia : Z'. 2.2.53 ; gratia : P. 2.6.32 ; 4.1.23 ; uirtus : P. 4.8.47. Apart from the fully personified and embodied apparition of Amor in P. 3.3, the erotic poet's pupil, object of his didactics and an "unbiassed witness" to his rectitude, the personification of amor in the exilic works is of a non-erotic kind, and is not frequent. It occurs at P. 1.9.8 and 4.12.18. (12) Age is personified at T. 3.7.35, 36 ; 4.8.13 ; P. 1.4.2, and youth at P. 1.10.12.</page><page sequence="5">106 J.-M. CLAASSEN meteorological phenomena (13). Sometimes "personification" is limited to the employment of a "human" verb, as at P. 4.13.39, 40 where the "sixth winter sees the exile in his suffering". Times and seasons are part of malevolent nature conspiring against the exile. At T. 3. 13.3-6 the exile reproaches his birthday for having followed him to Tomis. The poem is a conceit that applies the pathetic fallacy concretely. Verses 7, 8 reproach his birthday for not having allowed the poet to remain in the same place where as baby he was "first unfamiliar" (male cognitus ) with it. This is an inversion of the topos of the place where someone first was "known". The conceit, although rather charming, again serves to distance the modern reader rather than to extend his perception of pathos. A much stronger pathetic appeal comes from the invocation to the stars and the prayer that they will go and see what the exile's wife is doing and whether she still remembers him (T. 4.3.1-10). The poeťs extensive use of the Bear constellations as a means of placement of his place of exile as "directly beneath the Pole Star", offers a prime example of complex and allusive personification, with various levels of abstraction and concretization. The constellation is personified as the unfortunate maiden Callisto (14), whom readers remember from the Metamorphoses (2.401-530) as one of the first of Jupiter's victims, who had been saved from her predicament by being transposed to the stars, that is, by depersonalisation. Now she is equated with the poeťs oppressor, who, if the Jupiter- Augustus equation (which is a consistent feature of the exilic poetry) is carried to its logical conclusion, turns out to be the originator of her own woes. This complex allusion gains in piquancy when one remembers the tradition, recorded by Suetonius, Aug. 73, that Augutus had a birth-mark on his chest that resembled the constellation of the Great Bear. From the beginning, the Getic shore is depicted as inimical. The hostile im- pression conveyed by puns on sinister/Euxinus (meaning both "on the left" and "inimical") is strengthened by frequent personification. At T. 1.1 1.31, 32 the reader is told that the "left hand shore" of the Black Sea is "held" by blood and war. This impression is progressively strengthened. In the first five years of exile (until about 13 A.D.) (15), words from semantic fields that largely overlap with the human, indicate a small degree of personification. In a poem from the poeťs first year of exile, the place either sees or fears ( uidet aut metuit) the enemy ( T. 3. 10.69). It has a shore robbed or bereaved (orba) of harbours ( T. 3.12.33). Later, in a poem from about the fourth year of exile, it shows up (indicai) the author (P. 1.7.3). It is poor (inops) in peace, and its waves are chained (uincta) by ice (P. 2.2.94). It teaches (13) The depiction of the passage of time is a conventional topic exploited by the poet. See C. Santini in GIF21 (1975), p. 1-26, and Claassen (1986), Section 8.1.

By the time that the exile is writing the last book of the Pontic epistles (A.D. 14 or later) the country with its river has become fully personalised, as a not wholly malevolent, sentient being. The Hister allows ( non negai) Vestalis to display his courage, and the hostile Aegisos felt {sensit) that its natural talents were unequal to the fray ( P : 4.7.19-22). At the last, the Pontic land can even act as a witness {testis) who knows (seit) that the exile celebrates with games the birthday of the recent god (P. 4.9.114-116). A second look at this passage brings certain doubts. Are these funeral games, or games dedicated to the god, or perhaps a metaphor for joy evinced at the death of the oppressor? Are these games a fact of exile or a fiction of obsequium ? If the picture of the Pontic region has so far been consistently unpleasant, is the "calling to witness" of such an unreliable source not a pointer to irony ? Does the "birthday" refer to the emperor's official day of birth or to the day of his death and presumed apotheosis ? It is difficult to decide (17). 3. The pathetic fallacy and its inversion In his review of a collection of Greek funerary epigrams, Georg Luck points out that these several thousand émtv/ifiia exhibit a surprising similarity of technique and poetic approach (18). Of interest is his statement that there is a strong affinity with other Hellenistic poetry, particularly also in use of the pathetic fallacy. Much of what he says of these emrv/ißia could apply very well to the Tris tia and Epistolae ex Ponto. The exile frequently plays with the idea that he is already dead. Toward the end of the last book of poems from exile (P. 4.10.8) he makes the surprising statement duritia mors quoque uicta mea. "Even Death has been defeated by my hardship". This is a far cry from the kind of resolution of pain offered by, for instance, pastoral dirges, where death is resolved by the cyclic continuation of nature. Virgilian pastoral treats not only of death, but also of the problems of exile and dispossession, but, in the words of Lambert, "pastoral consoles by enfolding us in nature's sympathies" (19). The harsh setting of the world of Ovidian exile is anti-pastoral in the sense that it is antipathetic. Man and nature are at terrible odds. The active conspiracy of malevolent nature against the exile is of paramount interest in the storm poetry of T. 1.2, 4 and 11. The tone is set at T. 1.2.1-4, where (16) Other personifications of the place of exile occur at P. 1.10.24 ; 2.4.19 ; 4.10.57, 58. "Neutral" personifications of places are the two references to Germania (T. 3.12.47, 48 ; 4.2.43) and to the poet's own farm (Г. 4.8.9, 10). (17) There has been much discussion of the "sincerity" of the poet's attitude to the emperor. See my paper in AClass 33 (1987), p. 1 1-26. (18) Review of Beckby [ed.], Anthologia Graeca, vol. II, 2, 1957 in Gnomon 34 (1959), p. 51-55. (19) Ellen Z.

CLAASSEN sea and sky gods work as underwriters to Caesar's wrath. It may be argued that "gods" are personal powers anyway, but the reference here is to impersonal numinous powers which have gained a malevolent personality. The borders between numinous and natural waver. More directly, there is an identification of exile and ship, which groans ( ingemuit) over his lot ( T. 1 .4. 10) and which he in his turn pities as it is tired {fessa) (T. 1.10.20) (20). Here, as elsewhere, wordplay implies personification. The belligerence of the storm is expressed by syllepsis at T. 1. 1 1.27 s i mul insidiis hominum pelagique laboro and by use of "human" verbs at verse 41, pugnai hiemps, indignaturque. Knowledge (or lack of it) can be imputed to these personalised beings. At T. 1.2.26 the wave does not know ( nescit ) which ruling wind ( domino ) to obey. The powers of sea and sky know ( scitis ) that the exile is innocent ( T. 1.2.97, 98) and finally, they do feel for him, support him in his innocence, and consequently, subside ( 107-1 10). Their final personified characteristic is their setting of a "good example* to Caesar. As these beings have believed in the exile's innocence, and withdrawn their persecution, so the "great god" must follow their example. The pathetic fallacy makes the exile imagine at T. 1.4.22 that the wind obeys the great god in sympathy with him ( mecum ). Personification of the winds has been a conventional topos throughout classical literature. The traditional names of the winds lend themselves to "humanisation". So in the last book from exile, at P. 4.10.44, the poet can claim the Pontic area as the "birthplace of Boreas and Notus" (21). It is easiest to interpret Pontica tellus quoted above (P. 4.9. 1 15-7) as a métonymie expression used for its inhabitants. This is consistent with the inversion of the pathetic fallacy which develops strongly from Tristia 5 onwards, that is, from about the third year of exile. At T. 5.7.43-52 a picture of the Getae is drawn as being "scarcely human" ( homines non nomine digni ). Georg Luck in his commentary on the Tristia (22), points out that locus and homines go together as consistently (20) W.-H. Friedrich in Festschrift für Bruno S nel I, 1956, p. 77-87, gives a penetrating analysis of the tradition of storm imagery. He points to Virgil's innovation in introducing thunder and lightning into sea storms, as it were Jupiter aiding Neptune. The problem of embodied versus disembodied powers is pointed in later poetry by the "blasphemy" of Lucan : tonat ignaro caelum loue. Friedrich's observation that Roman storm depiction leans far more heavily on literature than on observation, supports De Saint Denis's analysis of the five Ovidian storms in his monumental work, Le rôle de la mer dans la poésie latine , p. 325-383, which has shown that Ovid's depiction does not gain in realism after exile and the presumably "real-life" experience of the hazards of sea travel. Cf. A. H. F. Grifftn in Pegasus 28 (1985), p. 28-34, on Ovidian use of the tradition in Т. 1.2. (21) Less conventional is the earlier P. 3.3.9 inhorruit aer ; "the air stood on end" which in translation has a fortuitously comical effect. (22) G. Luck, P. uvidius Naso. 1 ristia, vol. 11.

The adjective inhuma- nus had been applied to an impersonal "barbarity" ( barbaria ) at T. 3.9.2, but it is applied to the Getae themselves in later poems (23). Here the people have been depersonalised, but the place personified. The impression is of a relaxation of the normal borders between animate and inanimate, and a wavering in the exile's perception of reality. 4. Extensions of the exile's identity The poet's particular use in the exilic poems of the personification of abstract concepts is noteworthy. Against four fully elaborated allegorical figures in the Metamorphoses , viz. Inuidia, Fames , Somnus and Fama , the exilic works have individual personifications of abstract qualities as part of its metaphorical fabric. Such personification, as with the allegorical figures, makes them seem more concrete and therefore more "real", but here we seem to have, what may be called, for want of a better term, a more "personalised" type of personification, involving auto- biographical self-revelation (24). Fortuna occurs fairly frequently, always with a negative connotation, as at T. 1.5.34 (25). Lee comments on the importance of the imagery of the exile's fate as a ghost that haunts him ( T. 3.8.35, 36) (26). The poet's Fama is usually identified with him, as at P. 1.5.83, 84 where it is equally a pathetic victim of the decree of exile, and P. 3.1.47 where it complains in his stead. In a sense it becomes the exile's alter ego , with a distinct personality, but identified so closely with him that at times the identities of exile and Fama merge. At P. 2.1.1 it is depicted as having "won its way" ( peruenit ) to the distant Pontic region. Only at P. 2.9.3 Fama is a fully separate, personified abstraction. It brings news of the poet to his friend Cotta. It is a far more sympathetic apparition that Virgil's famous monster from Aen. 4. Here it acts as a substitute for the friendly daily intercourse which the lonely exile lacks. The extension of the exile's identity is not limited to identification with his reputation. The concept of mental travel and the mind's eye (e.g. T 4.1.57 ; P. 4.4.45) grows in importance throughout the Epistolae ex Ponto. It offers the exile a surrogate existence and extends his outreach towards the familiar. The frequency of words denoting mental activity as opposed to physical anguish is significant (27). Positive mental activity, visualisation of scenes removed in time and space, informs a large part of the exile's existence. It lies behind frequent use of the word imago (23) Inhumanos... Getas siso occurs at P. 1.5.66 ; 3.5.28 and 4.13.22. (24) The difference may also be ascribed to generic differences between epic and elegy. (25) Other personifications of Fortuna occur at T. 5.8.15 ; P. 2.3.51 ; 4.3.29-32 ; 4.9.121. (26) A. G. Lee in G &amp; R 18 (1949), p. 113-120.

CLAASSEN for what is essentially "memory", as in the poet's depiction of his last night in Rome (T. 1.3.1) (28). The concept of mental vision is explicitly referred to four times in the Tristia and the first three books of the Pontic epistles, together representing the first six years of exile. It occurs as frequently again in the single last book, comprising poems from the last four years of the poet's life (29). The efficacy of this form of psychological escape from his unpleasant present may be proven by reference to the poet's evocation of Roman scenes. The description of scenes in the city ( T. 3. 1 ) is graphic. It offers an illustration of the poeťs thesis that he can actually return to the city by means of his imagination. In P. 1.8 an unrealistically idealised picture of himself as gentleman-farmer on the Getic shore contrasts with a far more convincing, graphic evocation of his friend Severus engaged in his daily tasks in Rome, moving from the Campus Martius to the porticoes of the city, or along the Via Appia from Umbria to his Alban estates. Projection in time as well as space also feeds the meagre resources of an exiled present, as in P. 1.4, with the exile's realistic evocation of reunion with his wife. This existential consolation is passionately stated at P. 4.9.41 : "the mind alone is not an exile" (30). 5. Personification of poetry Luck(31) discusses the syntactic construction occurring at T. 1.5.41 and P. 3.4.91, which consists of the pronominal adjective mea and a feminine or neuter noun as the antecedent of a masculine relative pronoun introducing a verb in the first (28) Other occurrences of imago are : T. 3.4.63 ; P. 1.2.49 ; 1.9.7 ; 2.4.7. "Inner vision" is presented variously in T. 3.4.61 ; 3.8.35 ; 4.2.61 ; P. 1.8.34 ; 2.10.44 ; 3.4.20 ; 4.4.7 ; 4.9.3. (29) Personification of mens occurs at : T. 4.2.57 ; 5.2.7 ; P. 2.4.8 ; 3.5.48 ; 4.4.45 ; 4.9.33 and 41 ; 4.15.37. (30) Further extension of the exile's sense of identity also seems indicated by the conscious blurring of limits between the man and his natural functions by means of casual (perhaps "petrified") personification. His tears "have no end", fine careni (P. 1.2.27). The verb careo is primarily applied to living creatures in the allied senses of "wanting", "being deprived of (Lewis and Short). When he is ill, his vein "does not follow its usual path" that is, his blood will not flow normally : (пес) peragit soliti uena tenoris iter (P. 1.10.6). Food does "not carry out" its officium (P. 1.10.22). His voice "wins through", peruenit (P. 2.2.95). When writing poetry, his heart "warms" fernet, to its work (P. 3.9.22). The mental vision is a substitute for what the exile's eyes could not "enjoy", frui (P. 4.4.44). The relaxation of distinctions between human and non-human is extended to others. In his prophecy of triumph, the poet states that the head of the general will know ( nosse ) its wonted wreath (P. 3.4. 102). This may be normal synecdoche. P. 4.7.38 has a more explicit personification. Vestalis' shield will be covered in "wounds" uulnera. Gratitude to Sextus Pompeius is also expressed by means of personification (P. 4.1.24). Pompeius' treasure-chest, the exile says, never "denied" ( negauit ) him aid. (31) Luck, op. cit [n. 18].</page><page sequence="10">OVID'S WAVERING IDENTITY 1 1 1 person (32). Luck finds it paralleled in the Greek émrvpfiia. This fairly common Latin poetic construction is, however, not so much a matter of ad sensum syntax as of basic psychological reaction. There is a blurring of the distinction between the first person "I" and his cause or his work. This is personification of a sort, involving identification of creator and creation. Ultimately the exile's consolation lies in this kind of extension of his personality. Since Pindar (Nem. 5.2 ff.) there has been a convention that personifies a poetic creation (33). Personification of not only individual poems, or of his books, but also of his talent, as his Muse, and of Elegy itself, with all the punning on metrical "feet" that it involves, is typically Ovidian, and occurs frequently in the Amores. This personification can be casual, involving the use of "human" parts of speech and parts of the body as an ornamental flourish, or it can form the basis of a consistently worked-out conceit, for instance of the book as the poet's child, as in T. 1.1, T. 3.1 and T. 5.4. It would appear that this type of personification has, by the end of the Tris tia, been so well established that it consistently forms part of the Ovidian exilic convention and the poetic apparatus of the Epistolae ex Ponto. The establishment of the convention is progressive. T. 1.1 is a monologue. The exile instructs his book as his ambassador, child and surrogate, to go to Rome. Siegfried Besslich (1974) points out that the description of the appearance of the book (w. 3-8) involves a negative description of an ancient luxury edition of a book. It therefore also contains a set of instructions to its publisher. The term incultus (verse 3) "unkempt", "rough", perhaps even "unshaven", appears to offer deliberate play on Cat., Carm. 1, where the little book is "neatly polished", and trim. In another article Besslich points out that the colours of comua and frons (34) (verse 8), the book's "unkempt" appearance and general dishevelment are signs of mourning, which, in Roman custom, was not only usual at funerals, but was also displayed by supplicants and the accused in a court of law. The book acts as a surrogate for the poet in this sense also. Further it was practice to display the children of such an (32) T. 1.5.41 : causa mea est melior, qui non contraria foui' arma ... ; P. 3.4.91 : пес mea uerba legis, qui sum summotus ad Histrum. (33) See Luck (1977), p. 11, for a list of antecedents, also Besslich in Festschrift Widmann , 1 974, p. 1-12, for a full discussion of T. 1 . 1 as a development of Horace, Ep. 1 .20. Of importance is the Horatian idea that publication is comparable to prostitution, but that Augustus and Maecenas' opinions of his poetry are more important than that of the mass, whereas the Ovidian poem plays on contrasts with Horace : the poet's ancient lineage, his non-conformity, his foiling by means of his poetry of Augustus' bid to silence him, and his final recourse to the approbation of the general public. (34) The verse runs candida пес nigra comua fronte geras. Besslich, Gutenberg-Jb (1973), p. 44-50, makes out a strong case for reading пес with candida rather than with nigra Placement of пес/ non after the first word of a sentence is attested elsewhere, e.g. T. 2.393 ; 5.3.29 ; 5.3.40. The argument is acceptable. The translation would be : "And you must wear black knobs on your dingy front"/ "horns ... not very clean forehead". See Luck (1977), p. 15, on personification involved in frons at T. 2.241.</page><page sequence="11">112 J.-M. CLAASSEN accused, also dressed in mourning, in order to evoke sympathy. The dilapidated book is the poet's child. The conceit, once established, gets casual reference at 71 1.7.20 ( uiscera nostra) where the poet plays with the idea of his children as having "perished with their parent". This is again inverted at verse 35 ff., where a new prologue is proposed for the Metamorphoses , which are depicted as orphans, orba parente suo ... uolumina. This double and, in a sense, contradictory inversion is a typically Ovidian conceit. It is a further incongruous extension of T. 1.1.11 1-116, where the books of the Ars Amatoria are depicted as parricides. As always, the poet has managed to involve a multiplicity of meanings within a single ploy. Ovidian wit delights in the conceit, regardless, or perhaps even because, of the contradictions inherent in a literal application of the ploy (35). The progressive identification of poet and book is continued in T. 3.1, where the book itself is the speaker. By means of this device the poet can speak with the tactless naivete of a child. The conceit lends itself well to both playful pathos and playful irony. Ovidian topoi such as "limping" feet gain new life with reference to the long journey from Tomis (w. 11, 12). The assurance that the book does not "teach how to love" (v. 4) is at once an allusion to the ostensible cause of exile and a pointer to the pathos of the apparent futility of the poet's attempts to gain sympathy. The poet dwells lovingly on the buildings of Rome which the little book "sees* for the first time, while it looks for a place of publication. The public libraries, gifts by Augustus to the nation, are passed by. There is pathos, but also irony, in the fact that not even the library attached to the temple of Libertas will receive the little book. At last the book finds a place in private homes and turns to the broad reading public. The coda (verses 81, 82) is an affirmation of the greater value the poet attaches to his general readers than to imperial patronage. It once again offers a rejection of the Horatian stance. It may even be seen as a glancing attack on literary censorship. The charming conceit of poems as the author's children gets a new and rather insidious twist at T. 3.14.11-14, where the exile explains that, like Pallas Athena, his children (stirps ... progeniesque ) were made by him "without a mother". This apparently playful mythological ornament has several layers of meaning. Zeus gave birth to Athena from his head, that is, she is an intellectual product. So is poetry. No woman was involved. The poet's past life, that produced his erotic poetry, was therefore blamelessly intellectual, with no women involved. However, Athena, like all Zeus' children, was the object of Hera's jealousy. The equation Zeus- Jupiter- Augustus would make Livia, Hera and Julia, Athena, with the implication of (35) M. H. T. Davisson in CW11 (1984), p. 101-114, discussing the personification of the poems as children, considers that the fraternal relationship between past and present poems is emphasized, and that, just as parents see children as extensions of themselves, Ovid uses the poet-parent comparison to express the tension between involvement and detachment. Her paper offers a useful review of ancient precedents for the ploy.</page><page sequence="12">OVID'S WAVERING IDENTITY 1 1 3 stepmotherly animus (36). If this is stretching interpretation too far, there is a more obvious parallel. Zeus-Jupiter was known for his extramarital adventures. So was Augustus. Finally, Augustus has no son to follow him and had banished his daughter and lost his grandsons. He had no true progenies , in the basic sense of the word. Against this the poet affirms his own cyclic continuity after death, his immortality through poetry. 6. Degrees of identification between poet and poems Identification of a subtle nature may be discerned in T. 5.4, where the personified poem speaks, not as naive observer, but as an advocate that is fully cognizant of the facts of exile. The ploy lends objectivity (37) and externalises the poet's plea. The poem-persona can describe the poet's weeping while composing (a variation on the elegiac littera-litura conceit). Finally, it asks "what he does not ask" (w. 49, 50), that the poet's friend look after the exile's interests. The conceit enables the poet to demand once again through a mouthpiece what in his own person may seem repetitive importunity. Behind the ploy of the use of a surrogate lies the further psychological fact that the ostensible reader, the addressee of the poetic literary epistle, and also the real reader, the poet's reading public, know that the voice of the exile is speaking here through the words of his poem. The exile knows that they know. Therefore it is really he who is establishing contact with his Roman readers. The identities of exile and ostensible speaker have merged fully (38). Identification between poet and poem is not always fully worked out. This is an aspect of the Ovidian "wavering identity" as postulated by Fränkel. Even considering the autobiographical nature of the exilic works, it is useful to distinguish between Ovid the creative poet and Ovid the suffering man, whose moods the poet records. This is however a contentious matter, which is open to various interpretation, and which I have treated more extensively elsewhere (39). Taking such a distinction as read, for the moment, one may see the independent personality of the poetic creation as a "third persona", which has become firmly established by the beginning of the Pontic epistles, and which consistently wavers between surrogate for (as in P. 1.5, 8) (40) and identification with the exile. Such identification is expressed at P. 2.6.3 praebet mihi littera linguam (41). (36) Cf. M. Drucker, Der verbannte Dichter und der Kaisar-Gott, Diss. Heidelberg, 1977. (37) See Luck (1977), p. 295. (38) This is no new ploy. See for instance N. P. Gross in СУ74 (1979), p. 305-318, who identifies "six possible Ovids" in Amores 3.14. (39) Claassen (1986), Sections 2, 9.4.6 and 15 ; see also AClass 33 (1987) and A &amp;A 34 (1988), p. 158-169. (40) References to poetry as surrogate occur at P. 1.5.71-76 ; 1.7.1, 2 ; 4.5.1-4 ; 4.9.7, 8. (41) Identification can be read in P. 1.2.69 ; 2.5.33, 34 ; 2.7.1. So too the equation of Augustus with Jupiter wavers from full, to partial, to separation of identities. See Kenneth Scott in ТАРА 61 (1930), p. 43-69, for a thorough but humourless analysis of occurrences.</page><page sequence="13">114 J.-M. CLAASSEN With this convention has developed, too, the convention of the "comforting Muse", first fully established at T. 4. 10, in the grand invocation to his Muse (verses 1 17-124) which leads up to an assured statement of the poet's own immortality. The "Muse" frequently stands, not for an externalised inspiring deity, but also for the recipient of this inspiration, the poet's intellect (as in T. 5.9.26 or T. 5.12.60) and also the product of his inspiration, his poetry (P. 3.9.49). There is a constant shift between these three meanings of the word, and the circle is completed by a fourth aspect, identification of Muse and exiled poet, as active creator of his works. The essential "meaning" of the verse, pro se Musa locuta mea est (P. 3.4.66) may be conveyed prosaically as, "I defended myself and my poetry by means of poetry". Such a rendering does, however, destroy the poetic force of the verse, inherent in the powerful personification of poetry as an independently creative and sentient being. During the last book of the Pontic epistles there is sometimes an indication of a conscious separation, or perhaps of stronger differentiation, between the varying degrees of identification of the poet and his works. P. 4.2.25 speaks of a non- personal impetus sacer qui uatum pectora nutrit and later in the same poem (verse 45) occurs an allusion to the Pierides as solacia frigida, cold comfort. Yet at P. 4.3.16 the exile equates himself fully with his Muse. He is reproaching an erstwhile friend, now a bitter enemy, saying that formerly this man had admired his talent. Verse 16 is one of a series beginning Ule ego, , with all its epitaphic (and also pseudo-Virgilian) undertones, recalling their past friendship : ille ego iudiciis unica Musa tuis . There is no copulative but the correlation is clear. Identification is complete : "I was the unique Muse in your judgement". However, poem P. 4.5, once again portrayed as a separate personality, is sent as the poet's ambassador to the consul at Rome. Here there is personification but non-identity, or only identity at remove. The degree of identification has altered once more. 7. The final inversion : depersonalisation of the poet Inversion of conventional personification is an inescapable concomitant of most Ovidian conceits, as in the ring-poem, quoted above {Am. 2.15), where personifi- cation of the ring in the end leads to the identification of gift and lover, that is, depersonalisation of the lover in his desire to become an attractive object. It is generally accepted that no very strong pattern of arrangement obtains in Ex Ponto 4, which appears as a loose collection of poems from the last years before Ovid's death. Yet in his employment of the device of depersonalisation, there seems to be a progression in this book, which is not so much chronological as psycholo- gical. Perhaps "retrogression" is a better term. In the first poem of the collection {P. 4.1), Ovid makes explicit such depersonalisation in exile. Addressing Sextus Pompeius, the exile denotes himself a "creation" of the consul, a thing, which he</page><page sequence="14">OVID'S WAVERING IDENTITY 1 1 5 illustrates by reference to a series of works of art (42). This "work of art" he begs Pompeius to look after. The conceit is not playful and occurs as part of an unusually contrived and elaborate compliment. It may also be seen as typical of the psychologi- cal debilitation and alienation caused by loneliness or long isolation, symptomatic of loss of a sense of identity. Fluctuations of identification of poet and poems occur in the intervening poems, as discussed above (part 6). Total depersonalisation reappears in P. 4.15, also addressed to Pompeius. This poem serves as an illustration of the various threads of Ovid's use of personification, but the final emphasis is on depersonalisation. At verses 13, 14 the exile begs the consul (who was known for his wealth) to place him amongst his possessions. The noun-adjective hyperbaton in the hexameter graphi- cally illustrates the exile's request : inter opes et me, paruam rem, pone paternas | pars ego sim sensus quantulacumque tul The playful request is elaborately recast as emphatic statement in w. 15-20, leading up to the further request that Pompeius remove his possession, paruam rem though it be, to a better location. The poet reverts to the human mode in w. 25 to 37, with accent on the cerebral rather than the physical. Verse 37 assures Pompeius of the exile's unforgetting regard, but v. 38 reverts to the idea of the exile as "a possession". Personality and sentience are taken over by his Muse, which the exile hopes will transcend malevolent nature as represented by inhumanos ... Getas (w. 39, 40). The Muse finally will recognise ( norit ) Pompeius as the guardian of the welfare of his possession, without reference to libra et aere С3) (w. 41, 42). The roles of creator and creation have been reversed (44). Although this poem strikes one as an elabo- rately wrought compliment, involving conventional ornament of different kinds, the depersonalisation of the exile to an object sounds a note of psychological urgency. (42) Unusually for Ovid, this simile does not occur elsewhere in his œuvre. See Claassen (1986), Section 6.2. (43) Libra et aes were the formal symbols of sale in Roman commercial practice. Such a possession could be formally transferred through mancipatio. (44) At the risk of adding one more dubious theory to the formidable battery of histori- cistic research into the reasons for exile, it is tempting to accept the assumption arrived at independently by Otger Janssen, Vit de Romeinse Keizertijd in Collectanea Neerlandica 6 (1951), p. 77-105, and A. Fitton Brown in LCM 10 (1985), p. 19-22, namely that the poet never really was exiled, and on that to build a theory of reverse identification of poet and works. Could it be that the Ars Amatoria was actually banned from libraries after the Julia debacle, and that the exilic poems are the result of a pretence that the author suffered exile with his creation ? The ultimate reversal would be a re-identification of books and "exile". This suggestion would explain the literary nature of Ovid's geographical descriptions, but there are many arguments that could be brought against it. Professors Victor Schmidt and Heinz Hofmann of Groningen have revived the issue, and argued for Ovid's exile as fiction at the Leeds International Latin Seminar, April 1989. Their arguments have been partly countered by W. W. Ehlers A&amp;A 34 (1988), p. 144-157.</page><page sequence="15">116 J.-M. CLAASSEN There is a transition from inanimate "thing" in P. 4. 15 to "dead body" in the last poem, P. 4. 16, where the exile wavers between being dead (verse 1), to having been a name only (v. 3), to being his own immortal Muse (w. 45, 46), to being dead (v. 47), to having (being) nothing except sentient life (v. 49), to being a dead body (v. 51), to being (having) no room for blows (v. 52). All limits between life and death, extinction and immortality, feeling and being, body and spirit, personification and depersonalisation, have been blurred. These shifts and contradictions, familiar to readers of the poet's earlier, witty love poetry, have here been combined to create a sombre conceit with powerful impact. No matter that the strong rebuttal of carping Liuor (w. 47-52) portrays its victim as "dead". The depersonalisation of the victim here, has, as final paradox, shown the creative poet Ovid as immortal and able to transcend the restrictive bounds of exile. This last poem, with its compelling cry of psychologically urgent anguish, is the living poet's final triumph over the unmoving imperial authority that sought to still his poetic voice. The metaphorical death of the exile has ensured the continued life of the poet. University of Stellenbosch. Jo-Marie Claassen.</page></plain_text>
