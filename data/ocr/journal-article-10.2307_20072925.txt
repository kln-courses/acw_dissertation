(Brepols, Turnhout, 2005), 93.40. ISBN 2-503-51465-0. Reviewed by M.A. MICHAEL Christie's Education this book commemorates an extraordinary colloquium, inspired by F.O. B?ttner, devoted to Psalter illustration, which was held in Bam berg in October 1999. It brought together scholars mostly from Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and France. Sadly four of those scholars died before its publi cation five years later (Michael Camille, Harvey Stahl, Myra Orth and Janet Back house). The delay in publication may have been caused by the preparation of B?ttner's own contribution, which takes the form of a comprehensive survey of psalter decoration 'in the west' in over 106 pages, forming a small prefatory book in itself. The transactions are divided into five sec tions: Form and History, Function and Use, Iconographie Programmes, Iconographie Sub jects and Psalters with Pictorial Bindings. B?ttner's essay is itself further divided into about forty additional categories and sub categories suggesting a W?lfHinesque strategy where every kunstwissenschaftliche Grundfragen will be answered - and indeed this appears to be the case. The detailed subsections on the Psalm divisions build on the work of G?nther Haseloff in particular, assigning each initial of the traditional eight- and ten-part divisions of the Psalter to an iconographical 'stemma'. The image of King David, the accepted author of the Psalms, recurs both over time and across cultural boundaries as the protagonist in these initials, replaced usually only by prophets or other material when a specific project is planned. He is depicted playing the harp at the Beatus, Psalm 1, points to his eyes at Dominus illuminatio, Psalm 26 (27), fights Goliath at Dixi custodiam, Psalm 38 (39), is often seen with a fool at Dixit insipiens, Psalm 52 (53), appears sometimes to be drowriing at Salvum me, Psalm 68 (69), very often plays bells at Exultate Deo, Psalm 80 (81), and may be accompanied by singers at Cantate Domino, Psalm 97 (98). But it is the Trinity that is usually depicted at Dixit Dominus, Psalm 109 (no), indicating the literal interpretation of the words 'The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies a footstool'. Other sections describe and interpret variations of these themes and the idea of the author portrait associated with psalters as well as the concept of the psalter as a vehicle for illustration, both inside its pages and on its covers. Ulrich Kuder provides a catalogue raisonn? of psalters which have survived to c.8oo listing forty-three survivors. These range from the fourth- to fifth-century Coptic Psalter in the Cairo Museum to the Catharch of St Columba in the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, and the Corbie Psalter in Amiens (ninth century). Included are books which have the various ver sions of the text of the psalter from so-called 'vetus latina or '?tala fragments, based on the old Latin translation of the Greek, to those attributed to St Jerome and his activities as a translator in the late fourth century: the Romanum, essentially an old Latin text, the revised version known as the Gallicanum and iuxta Hebraeos (or Hebraicum), designed for scholarly use and apparently based on more direct Hebrew sources. Rainer Kahsnitz explores the anthropomorphic and animal initials in books from the eighth to the tenth century, discovering a complex interaction between scribe, artist and iconographer, who were sometimes the same person. Suzy Dufrenne provides a welcome Byzantine intrusion to the proceedings as she analyses the iconography of Psalm 121 (122) in the Greek monastic Psalters (psautiers int?grales). Through a detailed reading of the psalm and comparisons with other psalters, she is able to suggest new ways of interpreting their development as a form over several centuries. The most important essay in this section is that by Karl-Georg Pf?ndtner, 'Zwischen Frankreich und Byzanz', which explores the origins of MS 346 (Biblioteca Universitaria, Bologna) and MS Smith-Lesou?f 21 (Biblioth?que nationale de France, Paris). The relationship of these psalters to Byzantine art both in their decoration and in their iconography is little known outside Italy. This essay is complemented by Andreas Br?m on the development of fourteenth-century Neapolitan psalter decoration, Adelaide Ben nett's essay on the transformation of the Gothic psalter in France and Judith Raeber's exploration of patronage in the Benedictine convents of Muri and Engelberg. Ursula Nilgen's essay on how the psalter functioned for the educated and the unedu cated user of the manuscript suggests new ways of interpreting how what appears to be a book for reading was a work of art of the most sophisticated kind. Gude Suckale-Redlefsen and Judith Oliver examine female use and patronage of the psalter, which is interpreted as a vehicle for the full range of devotional and spiritual activities that most nuns needed in the Middle Ages. Alison Stones provides a detailed and convincing analysis of the process of production of the so-called Psalter-Hours of Yolande of Soissons, suggesting that it was made over a period of time and combines two separate projects. Nigel Morgan enumerates the instances of the depiction of patrons or visual references to patrons in psalters and sug gests ways in which subtle signs of ownership and use of the books can be found in initials. Patricia Stirneman reconsiders the iconography of the Copenhagen Psalter, suggesting that it was intended as a coronation present to Canute VI, and therefore its presence in Denmark in the thirteenth century is not merely a chance of fate. Janet Backhouse's article reinstates the Psalter of Henry VI (London, British Library, MS Cotton Dom.A.XVII), as a key royal book perhaps brought to England by Catherine of France (who married Henry V in 1420) and later adapted for Henry VI. The relationship of text and word is explored by Michael Camille and Lucy Sandier. Both give a detailed and convincing analysis of word imagery, breaking down sentences into their constituent parts and analysing the pictorial content of corresponding initials and marginal decoration. Continuing this theme, Myra Orth analyses the use of Fran?ois Demoulins's trans lations and commentaries on the psalter for Francis 1, concluding that visualisation was replaced by verbalisation in the form of trans lation of the psalter into the vernacular in the early sixteenth century. After the short sections on 'iconographie subjects' and bindings, 136 pages of black-and-white illustrations follow with useful Psalm and manuscript indices. The scholarship involved in the production of the book will remain a fitting monument to the state of research on psalter illustration around the second millenniurn. Readers in the future may, however, stop to ask why most of the authors are English or German and that no Italian, Spanish or other southern or eastern European authors were included in this project. Reading through the footnotes on their own (a sad, but necessary occupation for bibliographers with a book like this) suggests a solution: in them there is a subtext of references that document the gradual intellectual coloni sation of this material by a scholastic system bent on creating a view of the world based on the idea of a 'Kunst des Abendlandes' typical of Anglo-German scholarship from the 1930s to the 1960s. This is a period which now seems a world away and this massive book almost seems like its epitaph. THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CL JANUARY 2008 37</page></plain_text>
