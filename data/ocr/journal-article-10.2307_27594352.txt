<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO PUBLISHED HAUSA TRANSLATIONS OF THE QUR'?N AND THEIR DOCTRINAL BACKGROUND1 BY ANDREA BRIGAGLIA (Universit? degli Studi di Napoli 'L'Orientale') ABSTRACT This article presents an analysis of two written Hausa translations of the Qur'?n. Though emphasizing that these endeavours were strictly linked to their authors' previous careers as oral exegetes, the article argues also that a certain shift may take place in the significance of tafs?r through the importance assumed by written trans lation. These translations were published when a broad dogmatic conflict was tak ing place in Nigeria, and they feature a strong concern to de-legitimize or defend certain contended issues. The recurring object of debate in the two translations is usually Sufism, but, on a closer look, other related issues emerge as being at stake: the soundness of the local exegetical tradition, and the role of Ascarism as a set of theological doctrines providing the conventional framework for traditional exegetes to speak about God and His attributes. Issues of language and style are also briefly explored. Introduction Written and oral translations Amongst the twentieth century's developments of Muslim qur'?nic exegesis, the proliferation of efforts to produce written, comprehensive translations of the Qur'?n in different languages features as one of the most noticeable. As is well known, this practice had previously encoun tered, with some exceptions, a broad resistance inside the traditional scholarly milieux. Connected with the heavenly origin of the Qur'?n as a revealed text is also the idea that a semantic value is inherent in its formal features, which share the sacredness of its meaning. The arts of recitation, calligraphy, qur'?nic amulet manufacturing, and so on, flourished within a context of seeking, of the Word, the unity between signifier and signified. It should be observed, at any rate, that the practice of translating ?

Rather, oral sessions of periphrastic exegesis /translation in local languages (Fulfulde, Songhay, Tamachek, Kanuri over a very long period; Hausa, Yoruba, Wolof, Bambara and others in the last two centuries) are very likely to have played a crucial role in shaping West African Muslim 'cultures', reflected by the strong Islamic imprint which some languages of the area display in terms of lexicon, figures of speech, rhetorical apparatus, and so on.2 Notwithstanding some phenomenological and functional differences, the connection between written comprehensive translations and oral translating processes is very clear in the Nigerian context. The first scholars who published Hausa translations of the Qur'an had both pre viously gained great popularity thanks to their public activity as oral exegetes (masu tafsiri). In West Africa, the necessary skills for translating/ interpreting orally the Qur'an are transmitted, according to the tradi tional system of education, within the intellectual circles of the local 'ulam?', the actual permission to perform tafslr (qur'?nic exegesis, usu ally in a periphrastic form which, eventually, is very close to a trans lation) usually being given to the student only after he has gone through all the successive stages of religious learning.3 This permission is equiv alent to a sort of informal investiture as a religious 'cleric' (m?lam in Hausa). There also seem to exist some pre-modern samples of written experiments of qur'?nic translations, but apparently they were only used as a support for the oral sessions of tafslr in local languages, rather than being considered as separate, self-sufficient books.4 The act of translating orally the Qur'an (as an ongoing exegetical process, and not as a definitive interpretative achievement) appears fully consonant with the dominant episteme of pre-modern Islamic Africa, defined more or less in the terms used by Louis Brenner (Brenner 2001: 17-38), as well as with the social role of its scholarly class as media tors of sacred knowledge: ultimately, as translators, or, better, com mentators. A loose m?lamic class holds the socially sanctioned role of transmitting exegetical attitudes and working out from the interpreta tion of Scripture social norms of conduct. The meanings of the sacred words are not considered as directly transferable from one language to another, for the original text conveys a power (which we may define as 'talismanic' in a two-fold sense: because it has the power to influence the physical world, and because its manifold meanings have the power</page><page sequence="3">426 Andrea Brigaglia to open to an inner knowledge which has a transfiguring effect) that translations are not provided with.5 In principle, its meanings may be explored in any given language. But if an actual process of transfer of meanings is to take place, this should not occur from Arabic to another language (the phonetic and graphic features of the qur'?nic Arabic being approached themselves as conveying a semantic significance that would be ultimately untranslatable); rather, with each translation or exegesis, from an eternal/universal to a provisional/local dimension. The diffusion and popularization of written translations has posed a number of threats to this approach. In particular, they have inevitably affected the system whereby religious authority is conferred and the continuity of the knowledge transmission process is preserved. A writ ten translation of the Qur'?n, though never used for liturgical ends, may eventually sidestep the local religious elite's role as intermediary for access to sacred knowledge. It is not by chance that the first ini tiatives towards the composition of comprehensive, written translations of the Qur'?n into a given language often came from intellectuals whose education partly depended on sources external to the local scholarly circles, and whose efforts were largely directed against the traditional scholarly elite and its standard values. This is, for instance, the case for Abu Bakr Gum? in Nigeria, who published the first Hausa 'trans lation of the meanings' of the Qur'?n. When, as has often been the case in twentieth-century Africa, the pioneers of the move towards written translation were also adhering to religious movements or doctrines foreign to locally established ortho doxy, their endeavours were even more likely to open the way for intel lectual conflict and cultural change. Interestingly, some of the first written translations of the Qur'?n into African languages came thanks to the initiative of either Ahmadiyya groups, or Wahh?bi-oriented, inde pendent scholars:6 though having almost nothing in common from the point of view of the doctrines professed, both these trends diverge for one reason or the other from Ascar? doctrine, followed by the great majority of African 'ulam?', and both had a strong following in the context of the new urbanizing centres. Translations and exegetical conflict From the sociological point of view, in Africa as elsewhere, the diffusion of written translations which would (at least in theory) be accessible to everybody, was destined to jeopardize the role of the schol arly class, which had previously been considered the sole authorized</page><page sequence="4">Two Hausa Translations of the Qufan and their Doctrinal Background 427 transmitter/translator of qur'?nic knowledge, and which, though rarely acting socially as a monolithic entity, had been sharing a basic set of cultural attitudes and religious views. It would be misleading, nonetheless, to adopt a purely sociological approach to religious change, and look at the ideas and concepts expressed by religious actors in merely super-structural terms. While being, amongst other things, a strategy to sidestep the traditional mono poly of the m?lamic class over the transmission of religious knowledge, the efforts in 'translating the sacred' also pose (rather paradoxically, if one considers that they originated from an aspiration towards a new understanding of the text) a threat to the internal plurality of the exeget ical tradition itself. Written translations are, in fact, if compared to their oral counterparts (or to the tafs?r books in the classical style), usually much more prone to define and fix the 'orthodox' understanding of the ambiguous or polyvalent verses of Scripture around one single reified reading. This should not be considered as irrelevant or merely super structural to the polemics surrounding qur'?nic translations all over the Muslim world, inasmuch as the search for polyvalent readings of the text had been, at a certain stage of the classical age, one of the dis tinctive marks of the Sunni exegetical attitude.7 Moreover, the idea that each qur'?nic verse may have several meanings8 rests at the very core of the set of notions stemming from the belief in the Qur'?n's mirac ulous nature (Icj?z). The Nigerian case, and its highly controversial developments, is to be better appreciated in connection with a new framework, connected with the gradual demise of the traditional schol arly class, which has opened the way for a quest for 'monosemous read ings' (be they 'liberal' or 'radical'; 'mystical' or 'anti-mystical'; etc.). This has amplified, I argue, the likelihood of an exegetical conflict. This is not to mean that the search for 'what is God actually stating on the issue x' may not be intrinsically part of every sacred exegesis. But the philosophical approach of the reformist exegesis?and, interestingly, also of much of the 'anti-reformist' one like Kabar?'s efforts to produce a 'Sufi translation'?combined with the social and political need for new, clear-cut definitions of what the 'Muslim identity' is, certainly left very little room for a plural answer to this critical question. In Nigeria, in particular, the quest for a viable interpretative key exacerbated an already existing conflict centred on the nature of the Islamic identity, the legitimacy of the intellectual classical sources, the authority of the established scholarly elite and, above all, the right to Islamic citizen ship of Sufi doctrines and practices.</page><page sequence="5">428 Andrea Brigaglia Abu Bahr Gumi and JVasiru Kabara as Muslim scholars and qur'?nic interpreters The first Nigerian ever to write a complete translation of the Qur'?n into Hausa was, in 1979, the well-known ideologue of Islamic reformism and leader of the 'anti-Sufi' organization cIz?la, Saykh Abu Bakr Mahmud Gumi (1922-1992). His translation, published thanks to the initiative of the Saudi Kingdom, provoked the reaction of the leading authority of the Q?diriyya Sufi order in Kano, Saykh N?siru Kabar? (1925-1996), who, during the 1950s, had been one of the teachers of Gum? him self. Kabar?'s alternative translation was published in a four-volume edition sponsored by the Libyan Dacwa in 1988. Previously, both authors had become popular for the oral tafs?r they used to perform during the month of Ramadan. They had also written the only two contem porary Nigerian examples of a comprehensive tafs?r in Arabic. A few words on their religious careers, their exegetical attitudes and their scholarly sources as emerging from their previous activities, may provide the necessary background for an understanding of the thematic and stylistic choices they made as qur'?nic translators. Particular ref erence will be made here to their diverging attitudes towards the Egyptian scholar Jal?l ad-D?n as-Suyut? (d. 1505) and to one of his books, the Tafs?r al-Jal?layn, which he co-authored with Jal?l ad-D?n al-Mahall? (d. 1459). Notwithstanding its remarkable brevity (it is more a translation of the Qur'?n into a simpler Arabic language than a proper commen tary), the Jal?layn is unquestionably the most popular book of tafs?r in Nigeria and West Africa. The local oral tradition attributes to Suy?t?, during a journey to West Africa, the teaching of the Qur'?n at the Emir's Palace in Kano and the foundation of the first Nigerian school of tafs?r. Thus, the popularity of the Jal?layn is due, first, to the fact that its author is considered as a sort of mythical/historical father of Nigerian qur'?nic studies. Suyut? and the Tafs?r al-Jal?layn represent the direct link of the local exegetical tradition to the classical sources of the 'central' Islamic world; they are a symbol of the soundness of its transmission and of the orthodoxy of its shared background.9 Secondly, owing to its external characteristics (brevity and clearness), the Jal?layn has been functioning in Nigeria, as in most of the Muslim world, as a scholarly sanctioned Arabic model for the translations of the Qur'?n made orally into local languages. The Jal?layn thus appear in the Nigerian context as the connecting ring between the two complemen tary activities of written exegesis and oral translation. As I will argue in the</page><page sequence="6">Two Hausa Translations of the Qur'?n and their Doctrinal Background 429 following pages, dissociating from the Jal?layn implied, in the Nigerian context of tafsir studies, a broader detachment from the standard writ ten sources used by Nigerian 'ulam?', and a distrust of the soundness of their ordinary oral products. Gumi: cautiously questioning Suyut?'s authority Abu Bakr Gumfs career, which had an enormous impact on the recent religious and social developments of Nigerian Islam, has been the subject of extensive academic research. While recalling only the basic themes of his religious thought, reference will be made to more extensive published sources for additional details.10 Much of Gumfs intellectual activity is directly related, in one way or the other, to the exegesis of the Qur'?n.11 Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a period which corresponds to the peak of his career, he devoted much of his energy to the refutation of Sufism as a set of doc trines and to the spiritual path (tar?qd) as a set of practices. Gumfs ide ological background was mainly provided by the standard sources of contemporary Salafi thought (the Egyptian Sayyid Qutb is sometimes quoted, though never extensively), with some additional, sparse refer ences to Wahh?bi theologians (Ibn cAbd al-Wahh?b, Bin B?z). Gumfs project for the 'eradication' of Sufism led also, in 1978, to the establishment of the mass organization cLz?la, which immediately started a campaign against the Sufi brotherhoods.12 From the political point of view, his religious and social agenda was activated in strict cooperation with the Saudi Arabian politico-religious establishment and was also backed, although intermittently, by some Nigerian Government's top officials (both civilian and military).13 The emergence of Abu Bakr Gumi as the most innovative, although highly controversial, Nigerian mai tafsiri (Hausa for 'qur'?nic exegete') of the last decades clearly fol lowed three distinct phases.14 1) 1962-1966: he started to perform his oral tafsir in Kaduna, at the Sultan Bello Mosque, his audience being mostly made up of the administrative bourgeoisie of this northern political centre; dur ing this tafsir, he was questioning in a very straightforward way the dominant approaches to the Qur'?n, with particular refer ences to the spurious elements he attributed to Sufism. 2) 1967-1976: his tafsir sessions began to be broadcast, for the first time in Nigeria, by a radio station (Radio Kaduna). Alongside this second phase, he cautiously moderated the anti-Sufi tones of his comments in order to avoid an open conflict with the reli</page><page sequence="7">430 Andrea Brigaglia gious establishment, but he was able to gradually win a larger audience to his ideas. 3) 1977 onwards: the tones of his oral tafs?r became more explicit, and a series of public pronouncements of takf?r (excommunica tion) were made, directed particularly against the followers of the Tij?niyya.15 The publication, at the end of the 1970s, of two written exegetical works (the Arabic commentary entitled Radd al-adhh?n and the Hausa translation) was part of the third phase. This move was designed to attach Gumfs social and theological discourse against Sufism to the words of the Qur'?n, thereby strengthening its appeal and allowing it to penetrate into the traditionally minded environments, which had remained hitherto quite indifferent, when not hostile, to the reformist project. Gumfs stance towards the Jal?layn, as emerging from his oral and written tafs?r, appears rather ambivalent: while his Arabic tafs?r, the Radd al-adhh?n, which he also used as the basis for his oral tafs?r, faith fully reproduces entire sections of Suy?tfs, on some occasions he osten sibly diverges from it. It appears that all the occurrences where Gum?, more often implicitly than explicitly, diverges from the Jal?layn, stem from two main concerns: 1) questioning the reliability of the narrative traditions that Suyut? often quotes to comment on the qur'?nic stories of the ancient Prophets; 2) correcting the Jal?layn's statements that may corroborate Sufi views about sainthood.16 The critical attitude Gum? maintains towards the ancient prophetic narrations is quite significant: the emendation of the narrative aspects of tafs?r, branded as isr?'Uiyy?t (legendary stories that allegedly crept into the Muslim exegetical materials on the initiative of Jewish con verts aiming at corrupting the purity of the qur'?nic message), is a dis tinctive feature of recent (both reformist and 'fundamentalist') Muslim exegesis, connected to a sort of 'de-mythicizing' concern. On the con trary, the imaginative use of the narrative materials transmitted by the classical books are essential elements of the rhetorical skills which were traditionally required of Nigerian exegetes, and contemporary oral exegetes such as Saykh cIs? Waz?r? and Saykh T?hir Bauc? are still very prone to use them.17 Again, Gumfs main concern is to look for new sources and to put forward a new style of religious presence in public life. His critical attitude to the exegetical materials transmitted by tradition is substantially convergent with the opinions expressed by most modern exegetes,18 being to some extent an answer to the western</page><page sequence="8">Two Hausa Translations of the Qur'?n and their Doctrinal Background 431 criticism of the classical Islamic patterns of transmission in the whole discipline of hadlth. His main source in this respect seems to be Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966) and his famous commentary Ft ?il?l al-Qur^?n, which is probably the main filter Gumi uses to 're-interpret' the narrations transmitted by classical interpreters. The risk, however, is that, in a zealous attempt (at the same time rationalizing and purist) to rescue the qur'?nic narrations from the influence of 'legendary' materials, the logic of the qur'?nic narrations themselves may be lost, carried away by a general dislike for whatever may sound miraculous or extraordi nary. This dislike is usually shared by modernist as well as Salafl reform ers; though the respective outcomes may be at odds, in both cases the narrative elements of tafsir are often accepted only inasmuch as they can be used to define 'how a Muslim society should be', rather than to re-tell 'how things have always been', or to recount instances of intervention of the divine in human history. The desire to distance himself from al-Suy?tl (as the symbol of an entire system of scholastic warranty) was exhibited by Gumi very cautiously. At the same time, it was one of the driving forces of his exegesis. As his personal account tells, 'imagine what the reaction of my audience would have been, if in my first reading I had fully come out to disagree with such an authority on the Holy Qur'?n as Al-Suy?t?'.19 Kahar?: claiming Suyut?'s legacy Quite interestingly, contrary to Gurm and to his typical aspiration of disentangling himself from the bonds of traditional scholarship, Saykh N?siru Kabar?'s public prestige as a qur'?nic scholar was indissolubly joined to his claim of being the purest representative of the local tra dition of tafsir and, more particularly, of Suy?tfs authentic heritage within the country. The claim to Suy?tfs legacy was quite consistent with Kabar?'s broader profile.20 He was born in a scholarly family originating from one of the oldest centres of West African Islam (Timbuctu); his intel lectual training was entirely accomplished within the scholarly milieux of Kano linked to the Emirate's ruling family; he emerged as the pivot, at the mid-point of the century, of a revitalization process of the old est Nigerian brotherhood, the Q?diriyya: all these factors helped him assume in the 1960s the public role of Kano m?lamic tradition's flag bearer. This role, used during a first phase to counteract the emerg ing Tij?niyya, was later re-shaped by Kabar? against Abu Bakr Gum!,</page><page sequence="9">432 Andrea Brigaglia when Kano turned, through the concerted efforts of qadir? and tijan? m?lams, into the backbone of the opposition to the reformist cIz?la. Saykh N?siru Kabar? was an extraordinarily prolific writer. The total number of his works (theological treatises, pamphlets, works on Sufism, poems) has been assessed by Roman Loimeier as 117.21 He was par ticularly inclined towards poetry, especially of the madh genre (pane gyric of the Prophet), which he composed in great quantity both in Arabic and in Hausa. This inclination also strongly affected the style of his translation of the Qur'?n. N?siru Kabar? started performing his oral tafs?r in the second half of the 1940s, at less than 25 years of age. His tafs?r was initially per formed at the house of Muhammad Sanus?, who at that time was the Ciroma (a Hausa aristocratic title) of Kano. In 1953, when Sanus? was appointed as the new Emir of Kano, N?siru Kabar? succeeded to Saykh Mustafa, the qad? (chief-judge) of Bichi, who had previously been one of his teachers, as the official Ramadan mai tafsiri at the Emir's Palace.22 According to a (not universally accepted) claim, the scholastic autho rization (ij?za) to perform the official tafs?r at the Emir's palace could be traced back through a chain of transmission (isn?d) to Jal?l ad-D?n as-Suyut? himself. This fact probably rests at the core of Kabar?'s intel lectual legitimacy. He kept this significant role until 1990, when he let his son Qar?b Allah officially succeed him. But apart from being upheld by a traditional sanction, Kabar?'s career as an exegete depended also to a great extent on his personal talent. His oral tafs?r became rapidly legendary, not so much for its purely doctrinal elements, but rather for its unique stylistic features. Although being unusually quick (he was the only Nigerian mai tafsiri to complete the interpretation of the whole Qur'?n in one month) and exceptionally concise, it was realized in a way as to make the most of Kabar?'s rhetorical and poetical attitude: while most Nigerian exegetes usually wait for the qur'?nic reader to pause after reciting a given qur'?nic passage and then insert their own spoken interpretation, Kabar? used to chant his Hausa translation of the Qur'?n, superposing his own voice to the psalmody of the original qur'?nic text recited by his assis tant. The Arabic Qur'?n and the Hausa translation /commentary thus intertwined, producing a captivating rhythmic effect. During his oral, public tafs?r, Kabar? did not usually explore com plex doctrinal issues. Nonetheless, he has also written a huge com mentary on the Qur'?n in Arabic (Tanw?r al-Jann?n? tabw?b Diy?' al-ta'w?l li-ibr?z jaw?hir al-Qur'?n), based largely on the oldest book of tafs?r com posed by a Nigerian author, cAbd Allah dan Fodio's Diy?' al-Ta'w?l</page><page sequence="10">Two Hausa Translations of the Qufan and their Doctrinal Background 433 Unfortunately, though it is, perhaps, his most relevant scholarly accom plishment, it is as yet unpublished. This work, in particular, could help in shaping a clearer idea of the range of classical sources used by Kabar?, in addition to the two sources (the Jal?layn plus S?wfs super commentary) which provide the background to his written Hausa translation. The two translations: some notes on their stylistic and doctrinal aspects From the above presentation of the two authors, the differences in the two translations should now come quite easily to the surface. In the following, after quickly pointing to some basic formal discrepan cies, I will select two of the most relevant controversial issues, which deeply affected the motives behind the composition of the two works. Structure and style Gumfs translation is entitled Alkur^ani Mai Girma, da Kama Tarjamar Ma'anoninsa ?uwa ga harshen Hausa ('The Noble Qur'?n, together with the Translation of its Meanings into the Hausa language'). It has been edited several times, and thanks to the sponsorship of the Saudi govern ment, widely distributed in the local mosques of all the Hausa-speaking areas of West Africa (Nigeria, Niger, Ghana). It has also a broad dis tribution in markets, where it is sold at a very low price.23 The 1986 Medina edition, to which all the quotations in this paper refer, com prises one volume of 1,431 pages. As it is customary, every page is divided into two columns: on the right is the original Arabic text, on the left the Hausa translation. In general, it is very convenient to read, thanks to the clear partition and numbering of the verses (both in the original text and in the translation), and to the presence of a glossary and an index of subjects, very uncommon in Nigerian religious books. At the beginning of each S?ra, its basic subject is briefly evoked by a couple of lines devoted to an explanatory introduction, more or less in the same fashion used by the same author in the Arabic Radd, where he declared he was drawing this habit from Sayyid Qutb's tafsir.24 The literal translation is also enriched by a thick array of footnotes. Some of them are not particularly significant in terms of their subject mat ter, for instance, the ones he devotes to clarifying the meaning of some old-fashioned Hausa words. Though generally written in a very sim ple, ordinary Hausa, the Tarjama also makes use, here and there, of some unusual terms, especially when translating the qur'?nic passages</page><page sequence="11">434 Andrea Brigaglia describing Paradise; in these (rare) occurrences, Gum? adds a brief explanatory footnote in order to clarify, in ordinary Hausa, what is meant. It may look unusual for a translator to explain his own expla nations, but it should be emphasized that, generally speaking, being comprehensible to everybody is one of the main concerns of Gumfs translation. This attempt at avoiding a redundant scholarly apparatus is probably the main internal reason that gained it an unrivalled pop ularity (the other reasons being merely contextual, such as the prestige given by the Saudis endorsing its extensive distribution, and the fact that it was the first published work of its genre in Nigeria). N?siru Kabar?'s work bears a much more 'classicizing' title: Ihs?n al-Mann?n f? Ibr?z khab?y? al-Qur'?n ('The bounty of the Munificent, to display the arcane meanings of the Qur'?n'). Quite significantly, the sub-title specifies that it is a Tafs?r wa Tarjamat macan? al-Qur'?n al-Ka?m (^Interpretation and translation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'?n'), as if the author wanted to allude to his sceptical attitude towards the pos sibility of separating the two activities. It has been edited in Kano thanks to the sponsorship of the Libyan Dacwa, and it comprises four volumes (for a total number of 1,913 pages), in thick paper with spa cious printing and large letters. Inevitably, thus, it is very costly for the average Nigerian market. Because of these editorial choices, the impact of Kabar?'s Ihs?n has been, in quantitative terms, much inferior to that of Gumfs Tarjama. Today, it seems to have become a precious gift for students completing their qur'?nic studies, rather than an item to be found in ordinary houses and mosques.25 From a purely graphical point of view, the overall readability of Kabar?'s text is quite inferior to that of Gumfs work. While the lat ter carefully places all his own additional comments in footnotes, in order to separate them unmistakably from the literal translation, Kabar?'s frequent additional comments to the literal translation are enclosed in round brackets all along the Ihs?n. Though often interesting, these par enthetical comments may sometimes be exceedingly long.26 Some briefer additional remarks are also evidenced, usually when introducing a theme of the Qur'?n, by using capital letters instead of the normal text; here and there, a footnote is also exceptionally added. Inasmuch as each of these four components of the Ihs?n (plain text; add-ons in brackets; brief sentences in capital letters; footnotes) usually corresponds to a different source (oral tradition of the Hausa m?lams/translators; Jal?layn', Kabar?'s own argumentation; S?wfs supra-commentary on the Jal?layn), this choice may respond to a philological demand. But graphically, the effect is often confusing.</page><page sequence="12">Two Hausa Translations of the Qur'?n and their Doctrinal Background 435 This notwithstanding, the merit of Kabar?'s translation rests precisely in its aesthetic features, especially with regard to language. His trans lation is probably as much a poetical and stylistic accomplishment as a theological one. In general, whereas Gum! has a predilection for a clear and simple, straightforward language, Kabar? is much more inclined to infuse some sort of 'classical' elegance to his own work. Thus, the latter seems to be systematically choosing the most ancient and complex, though some times archaic and unusual, Hausa words to translate the qur'?nic Arabic.27 It would be interesting to see which of the two translations is more consistent (as far as lexical choices are concerned) with the standardized oral translations of the ordinary Nigerian m?lams who draw mainly on one or more oral tradition(s). A paradoxical outcome, though probably not inconsistent with the authors' own respective ambitions, is that while the language adopted by Gum! is full of the Arabic loanwords which are today commonly used in ordinary, spoken Hausa, Kabar? seems to be going for a 'purist' option: when possible, Arabic loanwords are carefully avoided, and pref erence is given to 'originally Hausa' words. Thus, though Arabic may be regarded as a kind of 'classical language' in the northern Nigerian context, Kabar?'s classicist option quite interestingly results in a mini mum of Arabic terms being used, while Gumfs modernist one leaves more room for the use of loanwords. Although a much more system atic analysis of the two works would be needed in order to confirm or correct this point, some individual examples of recurrent qur'?nic words will be listed below with the corresponding translations, in order to support this general impression, and give a very provisional idea of the authors' choices. 1. The two Names of God ar-Rahm?n and ar-Rah?m, which introduce each qur'?nic S?ra as part of the Basmala, are always translated by Gumi respectively as Mai rahama ('the owner of Compassion') and Mai jinkay ('the owner of Mercy'). Kabar?, on the contrary, avoids using the Arabic loanwords rahama to translate a word of the same root, and renders both the two Names as Maijinkai. In order to distinguish the two, his translation specifies that while the first 'mercy' is addressed in this world to every created being, the second pertains to the Hereafter, where it will be reserved to the believers. Thus, his complete rendering of ar-Rahm?n ar-Rah?m is as follows: Maijinkan talikai a duniya gab a day a, Maijinkan muminai</page><page sequence="13">436 Andrea Brigaglia a Lahira a hebe ('Merciful in this world towards the created beings, in general; Merciful in the Hereafter towards the believing ones, in particular'). 2. Another recurrent Name of God, al-Hak?m ('the Wise'), is trans lated by Gum? as Mai Hikima ('the owner of wisdom'). Again, Kabar? renders it with a Hausa term which is not derived from Arabic: Gwani ('clever'; 'wise'; 'expert'). 3. The adjective g?fil ('neglectful'), often referred by the Qur'?n to Man, is translated by Gum? with an Arabic loanword, mai g?fala. Kabar? renders it as marafkani. 4. Both Gum? and Kabar? translate the frequent qur'?nic exclama tion ^kall?P (cLo!'; 'verily not!'; 'not at all!') by a plurality of different words depending on the individual context. Nonetheless, Gum? turns always to another Arabic loanword such as hakkanl ('truly') or hak?kanl ('verily'). Though the overall sense of the phrase is rarely affected, this choice is rather inconsistent from the etymo logical point of view, hakkan and hak?kan being affirmative excla mations, while the Arabic kall? is a negative one. Kabar?, instead, successfully renders this expression with some exclamations of spo ken Hausa denoting irritation or anger: haggyala!; hir!; etc. One last remark with respect to language is that both authors choose to translate the apparently obvious, but in reality very complex and multifaceted, qur'?nic term muslim according to its etymological sense of 'surrending himself [unto God]'. Neither uses the ordinary Hausa musulmi, denoting Islam as a religious identity or formal adherence rather than as an inner attitude. This rendering is quite interesting because it may denote a will to allude to the potentially universalistic significance of the original Arabic word, lost in most translations. But in this case again, Abu Bakr Gum? turns to a Hausa word derived from the same Arabic root as the one it translates. Thus, in his trans lation the word muslim is rendered as mai sallamawa ('somebody who surrenders [to God's sovereignty]'). N?siru Kabar?'s rendering is per haps more efficacious: masujawuwa da dukkansu ('those who direct them selves completely [towards God]'). This latter expression I have found also in other oral tafs?rs such as T?hir Baucf s, but I am not yet able to state whether it can be considered as a standardized translation by Hausa m?lams. Kabar?'s pronounced and systematic etymological concern can be also illustrated by his translation of the term Rabb al-calam?n. While Gum? conforms to the common habit of translating it simply as Ubangijin</page><page sequence="14">Two Hausa Translations of the Qur'?n and their Doctrinal Background 437 talikai ('The Lord of the created beings'), Kabar? adds also the term Mai rainonsu ('who raises them'), this being the original sense of the Arabic verb rabba ('to breed'). Diverging issues: the authors' attitudes towards Sufism and As'arism In order to appreciate the significance of the two translations as being affected not only by different stylistic attitudes, but also by a strong polemical concern, one should look at the subjects addressed by the authors in the footnotes or in other brief comments additional to the literal translations. The most valuable of Gumf s numerous notes are probably the ones he devotes to clarify the normative consequences of some qur'?nic pas sages. Being first and foremost an expert scholar in the field of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), his knowledge is displayed essentially in the notes which specify the object of some general qur'?nic injunctions and their modalities of application. This is for instance the case at verse II: 223, where the Qur'?n mentions the categories of people entitled to receive alms (zak?t), and Gumfs note accurately specifies the sarta rul ing concerning this pillar (rukri) of Islam.28 Or at the beginnings of S?ra LXV, where the Qur'?n addresses the issue of divorce, and Gumfs long notes clearly summarize the ruling of the M?liki school over this topic.29 But apart from the recurrent notes of a normative character, the most common theme in the footnotes of Gumfs translation is, expect edly, the de-legitimation of Sufism. This aim is pursued in a very sys tematic way, by trying to relate some qur'?nic passages to the main points he had been already presenting to his Nigerian audience since the early 1970s: a. the Saints are not individual ascetics who gained (or were bestowed) access to special knowledge, but they are the common believers obeying the sacred Law (Tarjama, footnote to verse X: 62); b. addressing devotional practices to Saints, and hoping for their inter cession, is equivalent to polytheism (footnotes to verses XVIII: 102; XIX: 81; XXI: 98; XXXIX: 3); c. Sufi brotherhoods promote sectarian attitudes (footnote to verse XLII: 13); d. Sufi ritual practices are a heretical 'innovation' (bidcd) to the Islamic religion (footnotes to verses XI: 112; XX: 127; LVII: 27); and many others of the well-known objections Gum! was making to the Nigerian brotherhoods.30</page><page sequence="15">438 Andrea Brigaglia The publication of the Tarjama coincided chronologically with a broader strengthening of Gumfs attacks on the Nigerian brotherhoods, through his oral tafs?r and through the establishment of cIz?la. All these activities?translation included?were interpreted by the Nigerian broth erhoods as a fitna, a word filled, in Islamic imagery, with both social and eschatological implications, meaning 'chaotic rebellion', 'disorder', but also 'proof from God'. In 1977, only a couple of years before the publication of the Tarjama, the Sufi brotherhoods had started a reac tion by requesting Radio Kaduna to broadcast a sort of oral 'counter tafs?r' to balance Gumfs increasingly popular one. The publication of N?siru Kabar?'s 'counter-translation' may also be seen in the context of this increasingly tense atmosphere, with the activ ities of cIz?la triggering a polarizing effect on the Nigerian society as a whole. The introduction to Kabar?'s Ihs?n states rather emphatically that, since 'God has cursed the learned scholar who keeps silent when heresy breaks out and its darkness is raised',31 the main reason behind the composition of this work is 'to obstruct the door to factious sec tarianism, heresies, and seditious doctrines, which have been purported by some exegetes and translators, who have interpreted or translated the meanings of the Noble Qur'?n through their corrupted opinions and deviant tendencies, with the sole aim of supporting their own group'.32 As was mentioned previously, Kabar? seems to have intended his own translation rather as a kind of simplified tafs?r, thereby popular izing the materials collected into his voluminous Arabic Tanw?r al-Jann?n, than as a proper translation in the modern style like Gumi's one. In the end, since most of the parenthetical add-ons that are sys tematically added to the literal translation of every qur'?nic verse are taken from the Jal?layn, long excerpts of the Ihs?n eventually look some how like a Hausa translation of the two Jal?ls' tafs?r, which would be a useful endeavour on its own.33 This fact allows a clearer idea of the way N?siru Kabar? generally intended his own endeavour. First of all, his translation (as all his exegetical career) testified once again of an intimate link with Suy?tf s highly symbolical heritage I have outlined above. In addition, Kabar? probably wanted to portray himself in the public arena not as an individual who, thanks to his personal efforts, was producing an original essay of translation, but as the representa tive of an ancient, collective tradition of oral experiments by the local m?lamic class, moulded on the Jal?layn, to 'translate the untranslatable'. We can also reasonably guess that Kabar?'s goal was to make Gum? appear, by contrast, as a self-made scholar, whose translation was not properly sanctioned by any acceptable scholarly tradition.</page><page sequence="16">Two Hausa Translations of the Qufan and their Doctrinal Background 439 My overall impression, however, is that the apologetic concern which pervades Kabar?'s Ihs?n cannot but affect its final outlook, just as Gumfs polemic concern overshadowed other aspects of his Tarjama. Thus, just as one of the main subjects of Gumfs abundant footnotes was the criticism of Sufism, Kabar? devotes the majority of his rare footnotes to its staunch defence. To this aim, he often quotes from the H?siyyat as-S?wi, a commentary to the Jal?layn written by the Egyptian Ahmad ibn as-S?wI (d. 1825). In general, S?wfs book is widely used in West Africa, as a complement to the Jal?layn^ thanks to its being a 'commentary to' the most popular qur'?nic commentary, and to the fact that its author belonged to the m?liki school. S?wl was also a devoted advocate of the orthodoxy of Sufism. Short extracts from this book are quoted by Kabar? on at least six occasions, always referring to the issue of Sufism.34 Quite significantly Ahmad ibn as-S?wI, writing in a time when the influence of Wahh?bi theology was still confined to some regions of the Arabian Peninsula, explicitly refers to it as a heretical doctrine. Just to quote the most clear-cut example, the Ihs?n reports in Hausa translation a well-known paragraph of the H?siyya where Saw!, commenting on qur'?nic verse XXXV: 8 ('The devil is an enemy for you, so treat him as an enemy. He only summoneth his faction to be owners of the flaming Fire'), states that these words can be applied to the kh?rijite heretics who, 'changing the interpretation of the Qur'?n and the had?th, have declared it lawful to kill other Muslims and to take their property, and the same thing can be applied to a sect of the Hij?z which is called the Wahh?biyya. [. . .] May God eradicate them completely.'35 Apart from these quotations from S?wfs H?siyya or other scholarly works, the techniques Kabar? used in his translations to defend Sufism are quite analogous to the ones his opponent had used to attack it. It is mainly a question of footnotes to a verse or short introductory state ments to a qur'?nic passage, and not of any significant amendment in the literal translation. It may be useful again to quote a couple of exam ples. A good instance is the comment attached to verses LXXII: 16 17 ('If they tread the right path [ta?qa], We shall give them to drink water in abundance?that We may test them thereby, and whoso tur neth away from the remembrance [dhikr] of his Lord, He will thrust him into ever-growing torment'). Kabar?'s footnote remarks that the Qur'?n states clearly that the Sufi method (tar?qa) is an essential part of Islam, and that those who stigmatize Sufi ritual practice (dhikr) as un-Islamic are committing a very serious offence. In other instances, some ritual practices which are specifically dis tinctive of Kabar?'s branch of the Q?diriyya are also directly attached</page><page sequence="17">440 Andrea Brigaglia to qur'?nic verses: for instance, the controversial dhikr al-anf?s (special litanies recited by a particular breathing technique) is attached to verse IX: 114,36 and the sam?c (ecstatic listening to devotional music) to verse XXXIX: 16.37 Less obvious than the divergent attitude towards Sufism, but per haps not less important, is the last controversial aspect I intend to emphasize of these translations: the issue of ta'w?l, a word which has several connotations in Muslim exegesis, but which is mainly used in Nigeria in the sense used by the dialectic theologians (mutakallim?n), as 'allegorical interpretation'.38 Gumfs translation was soon attacked by the Nigerian 'ulam?' for its literalistic stance with respect to the translation of some controversial (mutas?bih) qur'?nic expressions such as 'God's Hand' and 'God's Face'. Following the publication of the Tarjama, the problem of the licitness of ta'w?l has become one of the most hotly disputed issues in Nigerian scholarly circles.39 It is not a new problem in Muslim theology, as the search for a theoretical conciliation between these qur'?nic expressions and other categorical Qur'?n statements such as laysa ka-mithliHi say3 ('nothing is alike to Him'), is one of the key theoretical matters of ancient Muslim theological treatises. It may be that the formulation of a theological synthesis reconciling God's transcendence and incompa rability (tanzfh) with the Qur'?n's occurrences which may seem to por tray God in somewhat human terms {tasb?h), was one of the main reasons accounting for the vast support found by the Ascariyya and Matur?diyya expositions of faith as the orthodox credo of Sunni Islam during the formative period of Muslim theology. Today, the debate about tanz?h and tasb?h has become very popular again, and it is one of the main diverging issues between the Wahh?bi theologians, who accuse the tra ditional scholars of altering God's own words, and the Ascari ones, who accuse Wahh?bis, in their turn, of upholding a rudely anthropomor phic idea of God opening the way for the negation of proper tawh?d (belief in the Oneness of God). The two Nigerian translations are no exception. Kabar?, besides being a Sufi, is nurtured by a typically Ascari attitude of strict adher ence to a 'non-imaginable' representation of God. He always glosses the qur'?nic yadu Ll?hi ('God's Hand') either with the Hausa ikon Allah ('God's Power') or with rahamar Allah ('God's Mercy'), depending on the context. Similarly, wajhu Ll?hi ('God's Face') is annotated with z?un Allah ('God's Essence'). Gum?, on the contrary, translates them literally, respectively as hannun Allah and fuskar Allah, without any further comment. The controversial issue was not?'traditional' Nigerian scholars like</page><page sequence="18">Two Hausa Translations of the Qufan and their Doctrinal Background 441 Kabar? were arguing?that Gum! had committed any grammatical fault in his translation of this verse. But, by not adding a formula that would allude to the conventional rules of the Ascari school concerning the interpretation of these expressions, he was accused of opening the way for ordinary Muslims to formulate an anthropomorphic idea of God. Gumi, in fact, had never explicitly said that these expressions were to be envisaged in purely human terms. But, at the same time, he did not state the opposite. I think that both Gum! and Kabar?, in reality, were approaching the issue as a very symbolic one. To make this point clearer, let us look at the translation of one of the relevant verses in this respect, Qur'?n VII: 54. As in many other similar verses, here appears the statement that God 'settled upon the Throne' (istaw? cal? l-cars). In this case, the two translations differ only in a small, but conceptually very significant, detail. Both translate the expression literally: Gumfs Tarjama has it as ya daidaita a kan aP arshi, and Kabar?'s Ihs?n, accurately avoiding translating the Arabic al-cars by the Hausa caique aP arshi, has it as ya daidaita a kan gadon mulkinsa: exactly equivalent to Gumi's rendering, thus, though perhaps rather more elegant, as usual. But while Kabar? also adds in parenthesis the formula daidaituwa wadda ta dace da Shi ('of a settling which is suitable to Him'), Gum! leaves the expression as it is. Why should the presence or absence of this short and enigmatic phrase, then, entail long and complex controversies? To answer this question, one must turn again, I would argue, to the Jal?layn and to the two authors' attitudes towards this book as outlined above. The expressions that Kabar? used in his translation to gloss the qur'?nic statement, in fact, was directly moulded upon a corresponding Arabic expression which is to be found, amongst others, in the Jal?layn: isti w?*an yallqu biHi, which means, just like its Hausa equivalent used by Kabar?, 'of a settling which is suitable to Him'. The importance of stressing this formula, apparently obvious and not very significant, is in the fact that it was the most succinct and handy allusion, used in the abridged Muslim exegetical texts such as the Jal?layn, to allude to the doctrine of 'bi-l? kayfd ('without [asking] how'). The bi-l? kayfa concept was the theological compromise that allowed the conciliation between the dogma of God's absolute incomparability and transcendence (tanzih), and these qur'?nic expressions which left some room for some sort of tasblh ('similarity' between God and the created being; 'anthropomorphism'). This issue was at the very heart of Ascari notions about God, the absolute transcendence of His Essence,</page><page sequence="19">442 Andrea Brigaglia and the relative knowability of His Attributes. While a short work like the Jal?layn would only allude to this position through that formulaic expression, more voluminous qur'?nic commentaries of classical Ascarite theologians such as Fakhr ad-D?n ar-Raz? (d. 1209) or Baydaw? (d. 1286) devoted to it lengthy dissertations. The most widely accepted conclusion was that, though always accepting the way God is describ ing Himself in the Qur'?n, one should not, at the same time, envisage His own Self-description in anthropomorphic terms: 'whoever describes God in a way which resembles His creation is a disbeliever, and who ever rejects God's own Self-description is a disbeliever alike'.40 Concise commentaries such as the Jal?layn, though not treating the matter in detail, would always conform to the Ascari habit of adding a simple (although rather enigmatic) expression such as 'of a settling which is suitable to Him': the aim was to acknowledge the existence of an artic ulated debate on this issue, rather than actually clarifying it, and that was probably the core meaning of Kabar?'s attachment to this stan dardized formula. In general, the issue of ta'w?l versus literalism was probably perceived as one that could seriously affect the way Muslims constructed their characteristic 'non-image' of God. It has been debated passionately, in today's Africa, even outside scholarly circles.41 It should also be stressed that the Sufi view on this subject, when articulated on an autonomous level?more purely 'metaphysical' than 'theological' in a strict sense?could also subtly differ from the state ments of the classical theologians, and God's transcendence would be rather addressed as 'transcending the opposition between tanz?h (tran scendence) and tasb?h (immanence) itself. It could be stated, for instance, that the Ascaris' emphasis on tanz?h, though stemming from a desire to avoid any limitation to His essence, could paradoxically pose an undue limitation to His own, unlimited capacity of manifesting Himself in immanent forms.42 In this case, I think that Kabar?'s contention stemmed not from a direct concern for the defence of Sufism as such, but from his resolve to express once more an unconditional loyalty to the established exeget ical tradition, which had integrated Ascari and Sufi discourses as two different levels of understanding applied to the same basic notions. Again, Kabar? was approaching the issue as a strongly symbolic one, and the bone of contention may have been a whole system of lexical and philosophical conventions of speaking about God, His acts and His attributes, than the mere translation of the verse in question (as stated above, neither he nor Gum? contested that the literal translation would</page><page sequence="20">Two Hausa Translations of the Qur'?n and their Doctrinal Background 443 sound like 'He settled upon His Throne'). In this respect, Kabar?'s symbolic approach does not seem to be unjustified, if we look at the whole matter from his own perspective. That brief remark ('of a set tling which is suitable to Him'), though merely allusive, was considered as the safeguard of a scholarly consensus built on a very subtle equi librium. Gumfs translation had eluded any acknowledgment of the Ascari views concerning such a central issue as the transcendence of 'God's Throne'. His opponents contented that, since his translation was generally full of long notes, the fact that this remark was missing could not be considered as accidental.43 To understand how far-reaching could be the consequences of Gumfs translation, one should also keep in mind that it was published in a context where this endeavour had never been previously undertaken: it entered the Nigerian scholastic arena not as a translation of a text, but as the translation of the Text Thus, the fact that it did not submit to the interpretative standards which were conventional amongst the local 'ulam?' easily resulted in an exeget ical clash. The search for a 'neutraV translation When the two translations were published, the fracture was so pal pable in Nigeria that a committee of 'independent' scholars was entrusted with the composition of a third translation that could overcome the divide. The 'neutral' translation, entitled Lub?b al-bay?n fi macan? al Qur'?n: tataccen bayani na ma^anonin Alkurani,u was published in 1993 by a Kano publishing house, with the sponsorship of Aminu Dantata, a prominent businessman and active supporter of religious groups. Its three authors, Saykh N?sir Mustafa, Ust?dh Bello Sac?d and Tij?nl Y?suf, had a stronger academic background than both Kabar? and Gum!, but a weaker 'm?lamic' one. The first one was at that time the director of the renowned Kano School for Arabic Studies; the others were both researchers in Arabic and Hausa at Bayero University Kano. In their translation, they accurately avoid taking any explicit stance on the dividing issues of the two previous works: they keep silent, for instance, on the precise status of Khadir, Moses' instructor mentioned by S?ra XVIII (a Saint according to Kabar?; a Prophet according to Gumi). The disputed verse VII: 54 (the verse of the 'settling') is also followed by a note which, though mentioning the different opinions of the scholars concerning the proper meaning of God's istiw?' on the Throne, carefully avoids expressing a clear preference for any of them. Although it seems to follow an accurate linguistic standard, and notwithstanding</page><page sequence="21">444 Andrea Brigaglia its 'universalistic' aspiration, the Lub?b seems not to have been very successful, and it is apparently less renowned than both the Tarjama and the Ihs?n.^ Conclusion The first efforts to produce comprehensive written translations of the Qur'?n into Hausa, led in the 1970s and 1980s to very controversial outcomes. That they might eventually exacerbate an existing exegeti cal conflict was quite predictable, as their genesis was strictly linked to the growing need of finding clear-cut and politically mobilizing definitions of the 'Islamic identity'. The hottest issue in Abu Bakr Gumfs and N?siru Kabar?'s translations appears very clearly to be the legitimacy of Sufism. But at a deeper analysis of their style, language, sources and theological views, at least two other critical issues at stake come to the surface: the intellectual authority of the classical sources (as symbolized by the different attitudes towards Suy?tfs legacy), and the established orthodoxy of Ascarism (as symbolized by the different interpretations of 'God's settling on His Throne'). Generally speaking, I would suggest also that, for a better appreci ation of the significance of the conflict between Salafi reformist move ments and Sufi brotherhoods in contemporary Africa, more attention should be paid to the previously underestimated issue of Ascarism. Ascari theology, which accounts for an essential part of the traditional reli gious thinking in Muslim West Africa as elsewhere, is subjected today, like Sufism, to critical assessments by the emerging intellectuals pro fessing a Salafi or Wahh?bi allegiance. Although the theological formulations of the Ascarites do not always exactly coincide with the non-dualistic metaphysical discourse of the Sufis, the latter probably found in the formers' general inclination towards a cautious synthesis of opposites (God's incomparability and similarity; creation and secondary causes; and so on) a fertile ground for taking root. It seems that, in a context where, as in Muslim West Africa, the 'ulam?' formed until recent times a highly cohesive group, Ascarism and Sufism constituted two levels of a rather consistent dis course about God, Man, the Cosmos and the Qur'?n, and not two separate intellectual 'schools' or religious 'identities'. An intellectual reform which would conflict with the second, as in the case of move ments like ?zala, would necessarily entail also a reassessment of the former. The link between these two dimensions of recent dogmatic cleavages, still unexplored in a systematic way, may not be merely</page><page sequence="22">Two Hausa Translations of the Qur'?n and their Doctrinal Background 445 incidental. This may confirm the idea that 'Salafi' movements, under their apparent upholding of a 'purist' Muslim identity, have been the vehicle of a deep change in Muslim religious thought.

This article is based on one chapter of an unpublished thesis (Brigaglia 2005) on the broader issue of qur'?nic exegesis in contemporary northern Nigeria. 2. I am extremely grateful to Professor Murray Last for his many critical insights. Amongst them, the relevance of looking at the Hausa tafs?r/translations as a contin uum with the older Fulfulde exegetical tradition is one of the most fascinating. In fact, isolated case studies on these issues may give a misleading idea of their actual histori cal depth and regional width. Twenty years ago, an article by Louis Brenner and Murray Last suggested looking at the issue of oral translations of Islamic texts in West Africa (both of the tafs?r genre and not) from a trans-regional and long-term perspective (Brenner and Last 1985). Brenner's reflections on the diffusion of San?sf's Aq?da and its commentaries through standardized oral abridgements in local languages (kabbe) prob ably constitute the only extant application of this approach over the case study of one specific religious book (Brenner 1985). In an exposition of the changing perception of Bambara as a language in Mali's recent history, Francesco Zappa argues also that Alessandro Bausani's concept of 'Islamic languages' being shaped by a process of osmo sis from above (see Bausani 1967 and 1981)?originally formed through a comparative study of Asian classical literatures?may be usefully extended to the African context and to orality (Zappa 2003: 48-55). Only broader comparative research may delineate the actual picture of the cross-linguistic exchanges which have been taking place in the region through oral translations of religious texts and exegesis of the Qur'?n. If one considers the mobility of the Muslim clerical class throughout the region, it is very likely that these exchanges may have had a great relevance. 3. For an analysis of some samples of qur'?nic exegesis and oral translations into a West African language (Bambara), see Tamari 1996. On the position that tafs?r stud ies occupy in the curricula of the traditional West African Islamic schools, Tamari 2002.</page><page sequence="24">Two Hausa Translations of the Qur'?n and their Doctrinal Background 447 4. See Bivar's comments on a Bornuan qur'?nic manuscript with interlinear glosses in Kanembu (Bivar 1960). 5. This is the main reason why, as Brenner and Last pointed out, African Sufi 'ulam?' would consider translations of the Qur'?n as irrelevant, though not objection able (1985: 439). 6. In some instances, the first translators were also Christian missionaries. For some examples related to different African languages, see: Ma'ayergi 1994; Lacunza-Balda 1997; Abubakre 1986. A Malian scholar of a reformist 'wahh?bi' inclination is currently working on the first comprehensive Bambara translation (Zappa 2003: 56-92). 7. Norman Calder (1993) uses the term 'acquisitive tradition' to indicate a tendency, which he considers as distinctive of the Sunni exegetical attitude at least up to the four teenth century, to progressively extend the possible readings of the Text in order to include new meanings. 8. According to different traditions attributed to the Prophet or to his Companions, the senses of each verse (or word, or letter) of the Qur'?n may be of four, five, seven, etc. In exoteric exegesis, this notion was often reflected by a meticulous analysis of the grammatical nuances of the qur'?nic language. Esoteric exegesis would rely upon this notion in its search for the correspondences between the scriptural 'four senses' and the different levels of Reality/Self. This idea, asserted especially by Sufis, has also an imme diate parallel in medieval Christian and Jewish biblical exegesis (see Synan 2003; B?wering 2003). 9. M?lam Basir Buhar? (Kano State History and Culture Bureau, interviews, July 2002). The passionate attachment that the Nigerian scholars usually show towards the Jal?layn leads Musa (2000) to maintain that the Nigerian exegetes rely almost exclu sively on this book. During my research I have ranged, on the contrary, over a wide number of sources being used at different levels by the Nigerian scholars. Musa's remarks probably result from his taking into account only the public sessions of tafsir occurring during Ramadan, where exegetes often follow, effectively, only the text of the Jal?layn. He seems to neglect, on the other side, the higher levels of tafsir activities, based on a plurality of sources (see Brigaglia 2005: appendix, 377-87 for a range of the tafsir books mentioned by a limited number of Nigerian authors). 10.

I rely as well on some tapes of his oral tafsir of the 1970s, as well as to an interview with one of his closest disciples, Muhammad Ahmad Sanusi Gumbi (Kaduna, 31/8/2002). 11. His first work (al-Aqlda as-Sahlha) is the only one that does not belong directly to the tafsir genre. It was, nonetheless, very important in his career, for it is a theo logical treatise entirely devoted to the refutation of Sufism, with particular reference to the Q?diriyya and Tij?niyya brotherhoods (Loimeier 1997: 186-206). 12. Tz?la is probably the best-known West African movement of a salafl reformism. For details, see Kane 2003; Loimeier 1997: 207-324. 13. On the other hand, the activities of '?zala were partially hindered by some of the local Emirate establishments, especially in Kano and Bornu. 14. These phases are highlighted by Gumi himself (Tsiga/Gumi 1992: 130-33). 15. One of the best known is the statement according to which every Muslim who recites the invocation of blessings on the Prophet called Sal?t al-F?tih (which, in the 1970s, was recited on all social occasions by the majority of the Nigerian Muslims) should be regarded as an apostate. 16. See, for instance, the comment on the qur'?nic narration of the encounter between Moses and Khadir (XVIII: 65), where, contrary to Suy?ti, Gumi states that Khadir was not a Saint but a Prophet (Radd: 390). 17. Observation from listening to tape-recorded tafsir. 18. See Gumfs introduction to the Radd, 1. After his death, his followers pushed this approach even further, and today Gumi's tafsir is the object of critical assessments by</page><page sequence="25">448 Andrea Brigaglia the younger generation of cIz?la: authors heavily influenced by his approach may thus criticize their own master, in their turn, for having reported some stories of dubious origin (Jacfar Mahm?d's oral tafs?r of S?ra XVIII and XX, recorded tapes). 19. Tsiga/Gumi 1992: 132. 20. On N?siru Kabar? and his significance on the development of Nigerian Islam, see Paden 1973 (152-169) and Loimeier 1997 (52-82); on his life: Kabara 1980; on his writings: Loimeier 1991. My description of his tafs?r is based on some tapes dating to the 1980s, and to an interview conducted in Kano (Sept. 2002) with his son and suc cessor, Qar?b Allah N?siru Kabar?. 21. Loimeier 1991: 117. 22. M?lam Bas?r Buhar?, interview (Kano, November 2002). 23. The price varies according to the edition and the sellers, but it is far less than the average price of imported Arabic books. 24. Radd, 828. 25. Personal observation, limited to Kano. 26. See, for instance, at verse XVIII: 64, when the mysterious encounter between Moses and Khadir is introduced by a comment in round brackets of more then two entire pages. 27. Some occurrences may be quoted, by way of example, amongst Kabar?'s lexi cal choices: 1) to the ordinary form of spoken Hausa for the demonstrative pronouns (can, mancan, wadancan), he often prefers the following, more unusual forms: cananka, wan cananka, wadancankd); 2) plurals of rather ordinary names are often chosen according to ancient forms with doubling of the second syllable: gidaddaji ('houses') instead of the more common gidaje, sunannaki ('names') instead of sunaye; 3) to translate some qur'?nic terms which, though grammatically very simple, may have some theological relevance, Kabar? seems also to choose a more accurate formula than Gum?: just to quote an example, the Arabic gayrahu ('not him') for instance, if referred to God, becomes in Kabar?'s work da ya wanice Shi ('which is distinct from Him') instead of the more imme diate but less elegant ba shi ?a ('which is not Him'), as Gum? translates. 28. Tarjama, 71, note 1. 29. Tarjama, 1232-35. 30. For a more complete view of these controversial issues, see, in addition to the above-mentioned sources on Gum? and cIz?la, also Umar 1999. 31. Fa-inna Ll?ha lacina l-c?lim as-s?kit Hnda hayj?n al-bidca wa-thawr?t zulmatih? (Ihs?n, 15). 32. Li-sadd abwab al-ahway wa-l-bidac wa-l-fitan allati barazat min bacd al-mufassinn wa-l mutarjim?n alladh?na fassar? aw tarjam? macan? al-Qur'?n al-Kar?m fa-adkhal? fi dh?lika ar?3ahum az-z?htfa wa ahw?'ahum ad-d?lla wa-hum yurid?na bi-dh?lika tathb?t madh?hibihim (Ihs?n, 16). 33. Kabar?'s quasi-devotional adherence to the text of the Jal?layn is so scrupulous that he also literally translates some apparently insignificant considerations. Thus for instance, in his translation of the qur'?nic verse which states that God 'taught Adam all the names' (II: 30), he conforms to the exact Jal?layn's wording by glossing 'har kwarya da masaki da ludayi' ('calabash, gourd and ladle too'; in the Jal?layn: 'hatt? al-qasca wa-l-migrqfa'). The meaning alluded to is that Adam was taught by God human lan guage both in its universals and in its particulars. It is striking, though, that Kabar? carefully avoids any alteration of the Jal?layri's text, even in its least significant details. 34. Ihs?n, 866; 1263; 1369; 1371; 1388; 1503. 35. Ihs?n, 1299. Tal Tamari, in her report about the curricula of the Malian tradi tional schools, also acknowledges the diffusion of Saw?'s commentary to the Jal?layn in the local tafs?r studies, but she seems to neglect its anti-wahh?bi character (2002: 108) as one of the main reasons likely to account for its popularity. 36. The verse states that 'Abraham was soft of heart, long-suffering (aww?h)\ The word the Qur'?n uses to describe Abraham's God-fearing, nostalgic attitude is derived from a verb (?h) which onomatopoeically means 'to sigh'. Through this interesting</page><page sequence="26">Two Hausa Translations of the Qwfan and their Doctrinal Background 449 etymological annotation, Kabara traces the breathing techniques of the Sufis back to Abraham's sighing due to his yearning for a return to God: Aaahl Aaahl AaahP [Ihs?n, 565). 37. 'Those who listen to the Word and follow the Best thereof. Such are those whom God guideth, and such are men of understanding'. Both the dhikr al-anf?s and the use of musical instruments (bendlri percussion) during the ritual practices were adopted by N?siru Kabar? after his first trip to Baghdad. Some Nigerian 'ulam?' of the Q?diriyya questioned their legitimacy, and Kabar? devoted a treatise to their defence {Khul?sat at Tahrlr fl dhikr al-anf?s wa al-bandlr). 38. Ta'wll can also mean 'symbolical' or 'esoteric' interpretation. It is used, with different nuances, in the exegesis of the Sufis, the Shiites, the dialectic theologians and the philosophers. Literally it means: 'taking back (a word) to its first (awwal, from the root 'wl, as ta'wll) meaning'. Thus, the ta'wll of the Sufis is often based on a frequent and programmatic?though highly imaginative at the same time?use of etymology. Kabar?'s interpretation of the word aww?h in the example quoted at note 35 may be a good example of 'etymological ta'wlF. 39. All the Nigerian scholars I have interviewed, both amongst Gumfs followers (Sanusi Gumbi, JaTar Mahmud) and Sufi adherents (T?hir Bauc?, Qarib Allah N?siru; etc.), have pointed to this issue as the clearest divisive one in the last decades of Nigerian qur'?nic interpretation. 40. Ibn Kathir, Tafsir, vol. II: 230. 41. See Seesemann 2003, where the judiciary case of a Chadian farmer is treated, who maintained that 'God really sat upon His throne'. 42. This was roughly, for instance, the position of Ibn cArabi (d. 1240) and non dualistic Sufis. See Ventura 1981: 69-71. 43. This remark, on the contrary, is present in Gumfs tafsir in Arabic, where it is rendered, like the Jal?layn, as istiw?'an yallqu bihi. 44. The title is in Arabic, the subtitle in Hausa. Both mean: 'a summarized expla nation of the meanings of the Qur'?n'. 45. Personal, provisional observation, based on the fact that the Lub?b has been men tioned to me very rarely by scholars and students interviewed on the subject. I lack any precise quantitative data, though, on the effective distribution of the three works in the local markets.</page></plain_text>
