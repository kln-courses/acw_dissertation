<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elliot Wolfson THE SECRET OF THE GARMENT IN NAHMANIDES I In a recently published monograph, The Secret of the Garment in the Zohar,1 Dorit Cohen-Alloro discusses Nahmanides' cryptic reference in his commentary to Gen. 18:1 to the esoteric doctrine of the garment,מלבוש, in conjunction with a more elaborate statement made by Moses de Leon in his Sefer ha-Rimmon (1287).2 De Leon himself in that context explicitly mentions Nahmanides, citing the latter's critique of Maimonides' philosophical interpretation of Jacob's struggle with the angel recorded in Gen. 32:25.3 According to Maimonides, the vision of the angel in this case, as in other biblical episodes, should be explained as an account of something which occurred in a "prophetic vision" (הנבואה מראה) rather than an objectively verifiable sense datum in the spatial-temporal world. Following the prophetology developed in Arabic philosophy, especially that of Alfarabi and Avicenna, Maimonides sharply contrasts that which is and that which is apprehended in a prophetic state.4 In Maimonides' own words: events related in prophetic parables "are not real actions, actions that exist for the external senses."5 De Leon relies on Nahmanides who, as he says, already Cf. D. Cohen-Alloro, The Secret of the Garment in the Zohar (Jerusalem, 1987), pp. 26-30 [in Hebrew], Cf. E. Wolfson, The Book of the Pomegranate: Moses de Leon's Sefer ha-Rimmon (Atlanta, 1988), pp. 316-17 (Hebrew text); see also p. 38 of the English section. See esp. Guide of the Perplexed, II, 42. Cf. C. Sirat, Les Theories des visions surnaturelles dans la pensee juive du Moyen Age (Leiden, 1969), p. 142. On purely noetic grounds there is no difference between a prophetic vision and regular sense experience. On the contrary, as Maimonides states in the Guide of the Perplexed, III, 24, one of the signs of genuine prophecy is that "all that is seen by the prophet in a vision of prophecy is, for the prophet, true and certain" for "the prophet has no doubts in any way concerning anything in it, and that, for him, its status is the same as that of all existing things that are apprehended through the senses or the intellect." Guide of the Perplexed, II, 46; see also I, 27.</page><page sequence="2">XXVI Elliot Wolfson challenged Maimonides on the grounds that in a prophetic state the vision of an angel is an actual vision (ראייה ממש) and not merely some phantasm in the mind of the prophet. In the continuation of the text de Leon goes on to explain the actual appearance of angels, which by nature are intelligible spirits, in terms of their assuming the form of a physical human being upon descending to the terrestrial realm. Although Cohen-Alloro does note at least two critical differences between Nahmanides and de Leon,6 a point to which I shall return below, she nevertheless assumes that de Leon's explanation provides a helpful clue in understanding Nahmanides' terse remark. In short, according to Cohen-Alloro, the essential meaning of Nahmanides' use of the word מלבוש can be gathered from de Leon's usage, i.e., for Nahmanides, as for de Leon, this phenomenon refers to the manifestation of an angel clothed in the corporeal form of a human being. The position adopted by Cohen-Alloro has been affirmed in the past by other scholars, including most prominently, Gershom Scholem7 and Moshe Idel.8 The purpose of this paper is to suggest an alternative interpretation of Nahmanides' esoteric tradition concerning the garment. Surprisingly enough, the interpretation of Nahmanides' reference to the secret of the מלבוש in terms of the notion of an angelic garment, as adopted by de Leon in his Hebrew theosophic writings and in the Zohar, also finds expression in some of the commentators on Nahmanides from the school of Solomon ibn Adret and Isaac ben Todros. This would seem to strengthen the interpretation of Nahmanides' remark concerning the מלבוש that I am suggesting should be rejected. On the other hand, some of the commentators from this circle have preserved, albeit in highly enigmatic language, an explanation of Nahmanides' statement which is substantially different from that preferred by de Leon and some of the other Nahmanedian commentators. Thus, while the evidence from this body of literature is not conclusive, there is at least some ground in which to anchor my reading. Before proceeding with an examination of the critical passages, let me remark that I will not be concerned here either with tracing earlier sources for Nahmanides view or pointing out contemporary parallels,9 but will be content Cf. Cohen-Alloro, The Secret of the Garment, pp. 30 and 37. Cf. G. Scholem, "The Paradise Garb of Souls and the Origin of the Concept of Haluqa de Rabbanan," Tarbiz 24 (1954-55): 296, n. 15 [in Hebrew]. Cf. M. Idel, "The World of Angels in Human Form," Studies in Jewish Mysticism, Philosophy, and Ethical Literature presented to Isaiah Tishby on his Seventy-fifth Birthday (Jerusalem, 1986), p. 47 [in Hebrew], It should be noted that Nahmanides' doctrine of the garment, as I will explain it, shares some interesting similarities with views expressed in the German Pietistic literature according to which the Glory or the Shekhinah is identified with the highest angel. See esp. the text from</page><page sequence="3">The Secret of the Garment in Nahmanides XXVII rather with determining clearly what Nahmanides himself meant when he alluded to the doctrine of the garment, an idea that has had a long and variegated history in kabbalistic literature. II In his commentary to Gen. 18:1 Nahmanides engages in a lengthy critique of Maimonidesי view that every prophet, with the exception of Moses, received his prophecy through an angel.10 Nahmanides argues that insofar as angels are separate intellects11 — a view generally espoused by medieval Jewish Sefer ha-Hokhmah, cited by Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah (Princeton, 1987),p. 185;andcf. J. Dan, Torat ha-Sod shel Haside 'Ashkenaz (Jerusalem, 19681, pp. 120-21. See also Sod ha Yihud le-R. Yehudah he-Hasid, in J. Dan, 'Iyyunim be-Sifrut Hasidut 'Ashkenaz (Ramat-Gan, 1975), p. 81: "This is in the image of the honorable Glory, Akatri'el Yah, the Lord of Hosts. And there is a midrash which attests that Akatri'rel is an angel." See below, n.51. On the blurring of the distinction between the Divine Glory and an angelic being in German Pietistic writings, see the pertinent remarks of A. Farber, "The Concept of the Merkabah in Thirteenth Century Jewish Esotericism: Sod ha-'Egoz and its Development" (Ph.D., Hebrew University, 1986), p. 261 [in Hebrew]. See also Sefer ha-Hayyim, in J. Dan, Tekstim be-Torat ha-'Elohut shel Hasidut 'Ashkenaz (Jerusalem, 1977), pp. 10, 19; Sefer ha-Navon, in 'lyyunim be-Sifrut Hasidut 'Ashkenaz, pp. 120-21; Sha'are ha-Sod ha-Yihud we-ha-'Emunah le-R.

Eleazar's texts mentioned above is attested by the fact that he cites it by name in his letter to the rabbis of Northern France; cf. Kitve Ramban, ed. H. Chavel (Jerusalem, 1982), 1:346-47. The similarity between Nahmanides discussion of the secret of the garment and the views of Eleazar of Worms has already been noted by I. Kamelhar, Rabbenu 'Ele'azar mi-Germaiza ha-Roqeah (New York, 1930), p. 52. (A German Pietistic parallel to Nahmanides tradition that the Torah is a continuum of divine names has been noted by M. Idel, "We Have No Kabbalistic Tradition on This," in Rabbi Moses Nahmanides (Ramban): Explorations in His Religious and Literary Virtuosity, ed. I. Twersky [Cambridge, 1983], p. 54, n. 10; see also Dan, Torat ha-Sod, p. 124, n. 45.) The connection between the Glory (or Shekhinah) and the angelic hypostasis is also evident in some of the earliest kabbalistic documents; see, e.g., the kabbalistic explanation attributed to a certain Abraham in an epistle of Samuel ben Mordecai to Yequtiel ha-Kohen, published by Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, pp. 225-26. Interesting in this regard as well is a text from Saadia Gaon cited by Judah ben Barzilai, Perush Sefer Yesirah, ed. S. J. Halberstam (Berlin, 1885), p. 20. Cf. J. Dan, "The Hidden Glory," in Dat we-Safah, ed. M. Hallamish and A. Kasher (Tel-Aviv, 1982), pp. 73-74 [in Hebrew]. The connection between the Divine Glory and the angel of God is indeed an ancient one in Jewish sources; cf. J. Fossum, The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord (Tubingen, 1985), pp. 177ff., 319ff. Cf. Guide of the Perplexed, II, 41; and see C. Sirat, Les Theories des visions surnaturelles, pp. 147-49. Cf. Perush 'al ha-Torah, Gen. 2:1; Exod. 20:3; Num. 22:23, 23:4: Deut. 18:9; Kitve Ramban, 1:149, 156, 174; 2:285.</page><page sequence="4">XXVIII Elliot Wolfson philosophers including Maimonides — then it must follow that when Scripture mentions an angel that is seen or heard, it must be regarded as a vision or dream but not a prophetic state. "In every place that Scripture mentions the seeing of an angel or the speech of an angel it is in a vision or dream, for the senses cannot apprehend the angels, but these are not prophetic visions (מראות הנבואה), for the one who can attain a vision of an angel or his speech is not a prophet."12 Underlying Nahmanides' argument are two assumptions: first, that the object of a prophetic experience is a real sense datum; and, secondly, that angels are separate intellects and thus cannot qualify as genuine sense data.13 From this passage it would appear, then, that for Nahmanides the one who sees an angel or who hears the angel's speech is not in the class of prophets.14 Elsewhere, however, in his commentary to Num. 22:23, "When the ass [of Balaam] caught sight of the angel of the Lord standing in the way," Nahmanides takes a slightly different approach. He rejects out of hand the possibility of construing the literal sense of this verse to mean that the ass actually saw the angel on the basis that angels are separate intellects and thus are not perceptible by the physical sense of sight. Indeed, notes Nahmanides, when Scripture relates that angels are seen either by prophets or men of the holy spirit, the intent is that they are seen through "visions of the rational soul" (במראות הנפש המשכלת), i.e., through an intellectual comprehension.15 It is obvious that this cannot be applied to the passage regarding Balaam's ass. Nevertheless, from this context it would appear that, according to Nahmanides, some sort of rational or intellectual vision of angels is possible in the prophetic state. Perush 'al ha-Torah, Gen. 18:1 (ed. Chavel, 1:104). A similar approach is taken by Isaac ibn Latif. He argues, however, that insofar as angels are incorporeal beings, the three men who visited Abraham were in fact human beings of a superior spiritual status, such as angels, and not angels at all. See his Ginze ha-Melekh, ed. A. Jellinek, inKokhav Yishaq 33 (1866): 12-13. The view that the three men who visited Abraham were prophets is also affirmed by other medieval exegetes, e.g., Abraham ibn Ezra and Gersonides. Cf. Kitve Ramban, 1:148. Other kabbalists criticized Maimonides' claim that every prophet, except Moses, received his prophecy through the intermediary of an angel. The kabbalistic attack is based on the commonly held assumption that prophecy derives from the sefirotic pleroma and not from the angelic realm which is located beneath the world of divine unity. For a clear statement of the kabbalistic perspective, see Joseph Gikatilla, Sha'are Orah, ed. J. Ben Shlomo (Jerusalem, 1981), 1:159-61; and cf. R. Goetschel, "The Conception of Prophecy in the Works of R. Moses de Leon and R. Joseph Gikatilla," in the "Proceedings of the Third International Conference on the History of Jewish Mysticism," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 8 (1989): 223-24 [in Hebrew]. For a later, but equally typical, statement, see Meir ibn Gabbai, 'Avodat ha-Qodesh (Jerusalem, 1973), IV:28, fols. 136a-b, and R. Goetschel (supra n. 14), p. 412.

Chavel, 1:521).</page><page sequence="5">The Secret of the Garment in Nahmanides XXIX In his commentary to Gen. 18:1 Nahmanides allows for one major exception to his rule that a biblical description of a vision of an angel cannot refer either to prophecy or to physical sight, viz., those instances where the "angel" — a term whose exact meaning in this context will shortly be determined — assumes the form of a human being. (The exception is repeated in the commentary to Num. 22:23, but even this exception does not apply here, for the phenomenon of the angel in a human garment is perceptible only to human beings, and in the case of BalaanTs ass the one having the vision is an animal and not a person.) When Scripture relates that an angel appeared to human beings in anthropomorphic form, there is an esoteric matter that distinguishes such occurrences from all other angelic visions. For Maimonides, such instances in the Bible are not to be treated as descriptions of things which actually occurred in the world and which are verifiable by the external senses, but are rather images produced in the mind of the prophet. Nahmanides unequivocally rejects Maimonides' position. That this is so can be seen from a comment that Nahmanides makes in his commentary to the book of Job. In the context of discussing various scriptural passages which assume the possibility that angels take the form of men when they appear to human beings, Nahmanides writes that "the matter is true and set according to its literal sense, established and standing according to its plain meaning... but there is a secret to the matter for the [mystical] tradition is the foundation of the true Torah.'"6 The appearance of angels in human form would thus seem to be a special instance which provides an exception to Nahmanides' own rule that angels are not physically perceptible in a prophetic experience. When Scripture describes the appearance of an angel in human form, the literal sense must be upheld. Yet, the literal sense is only comprehensible in light of the Kabbalistic secret.17 What, then, is the secret to which Nahmanides has here alluded? From Nahmanides' commentary to Gen. 18:1 it may be gathered that what he had in mind was the esoteric doctrine of the garment, later referred to by kabbalists as the 18.סוד המלבוש Nahmanides alludes to this doctrine in the Kitve Ramban, 1:26. The phenomenon of the convergence of peshat and sod in Nahmanides' biblical commentary has been noted by several scholars. Cf. B. Septimus, '"Open Rebuke and Concealed Love': Nahmanides and the Andalusian Tradition," in Rabbi Moses Nahmanides (Ramban): Explorations in His Religious and Literary Virtuosity,p. 21, n. 37, and the article by D. Bergerin the same volume, "Miracles and the Natural Order in Nahmanides," p. 112, n. 19. For a more comprehensive treatment of this subject, see E. Wolfson, '"By Way of Truth': Aspects of Nahmanides' Kabbalistic Hermeneutic," AJS Review 14 (1989), section II. For a contrary view, see A. Funkenstein, "Nahmanides' Symbolical Reading of History," in Studies in Jewish Mysticism, ed. J. Dan and F. Talmage (Cambridge, 1982), p. 133. Cf., e.g., Menahem Recanati, Perush 'a! ha-Torah (Jerusalem, 1961), fol. 88c; Isaac of Acre, Sefer Me'irat 'Einayim, ed. A. Goldreich (Jerusalem, 1981), pp. 183, 217.</page><page sequence="6">XXX Elliot Wolfson following cryptic remark: When [Scripture] mentions angels in the name of men... According to the opinion of our rabbis, this [involves] the created Glory in [the form of] the angels, called by those who know the garment, which is perceptible to the physical eyes of those who are pure as the pious and the sons of the prophets, but I cannot explain. במקום אשר יזכיר המלאכים בשם אנשים... על דעת רבותינו הוא כבוד נברא במלאכים יקרא אצל היודעים מלבוש יושג לעיני בשר בזכי הנפשות כחסידים ובני הנביאים ולא אוכל לפרש.19 The first thing to note is that Nahmanides' language, "when [Scripture] mentions angels in the name of men," has misled some of the commentators on Nahmanides into thinking that he restricted the phenomenon of the appearance of angels in human form to a specific class of angels. That is, according to this line of interpretation, Nahmanides is essentially following Maimonides' view that only angels from the tenth group, called אישים, i.e., the Active Intellect,20 could be apprehended by human beings. Thus, for example, in the commentary on Nahmanides attributed Meir to ibn Sahula21 we read: '"The created Glory [in the form of] the angels'(כבוד נברא במלאכים) is called a garment (מלבוש) for with respect to the angels there are various gradations... And those angels who are called by the name אנשים are clothed in the subtle aetheral body (גוף אויר דק) which appears to the pious, those of pure souls, and sons of the prophets, in a permanent way, without any other preparation."22 Even closer to the Maimonidean formulation is the following comment of Isaac of Acre in his Me'irat 'Einayim: "It appears that the view of the Rabbi [Nahmanides] is principally concerned with the angels who are first with respect to us, though Perush 'al ha-Torah, Gen. 18:1 (ed. Chavel, 1: 105-106). Cf. Mishneh Torah, Yesode ha-Torah, 2:7. According to Scholem, the real author of this commentary was ibn Sahula's teacher, Joshua ibn Shu'aib. See Peraqim le-Toledot Sifrut ha-Qabbalah (Jerusalem, 1931), p. 46; Kabbalah (Jerusalem, 1974), p. 61. In the Origins of the Kabbalah, however, Scholem, consistently refers to this work as that of ibn Sahula; see, e.g., p. 216.1 do not believe this represents a change in Scholem's mind (the original German version of the Origins was published years before the encyclopedia entry published in the book Kabbalah) but rather simply reflects Scholem's attempt to conform for bibliographical purposes to the traditional attribution. Cf. M. Idel, "An Unknown Commentary to the Mystical Secrets of Nahmanides," Da'at 2-3 (1978-79): 121, n. 5 [in Hebrew], For counter arguments to Scholem's view, see E.

First, the technical expression which Maimonides uses,אישים, is not used here by Nahmanides; he refers instead to אנשים which must be construed in a more generic way as a reference to human beings.28 Second, in the context of criticizing Maimonides5 understanding of prophecy through the medium of an angel (i.e., the separate intellect) in his sermon, Torat ha-Shem Temimah, Nahmanides explicitly mentions the pertinent formulation of Maimonides from the Mishneh Torah. "We do not agree with [the author of] Sefer ha-Madda' who said that... all the prophets [received their prophecy] by means of an angel except Moses, our master, may peace be upon him, and he allocates to them [the prophets] the tenth angel which is called 29יי.אישים It makes little sense to suppose that in his more elaborate critique of Maimonides' view on prophecy in the Torah commentary Nahmanides would accept (even in a modified way) the explanation of Maimonides which he had already rejected in another context. Yet, just such a supposition follows from the interpretation suggested by some of his commentators, both medieval and modern. It seems to me rather that when Nahmanides wrote, "when [Scripture] mentions angels in the name of men," he was addressing the more general phenomenon of the appearance of angels in human form, and not a specific class of angels. That this interpretation is correct may be further proven from the fact that after the relevant remark Nahmanides cites several other examples, one with Lot (cf. Gen. 19:Iff.) and two with Jacob (cf. Gen. 32:25 and 37:15), where Sefer Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 49. Cf. Shevile 'Emunah (Warsaw, 1887), fol. 13c. See reference above, n. 22. And cf. Yalqut Re'uveni (Warsaw, 1884), p. 178. Cf. 'Avodat ha-Qodesh, IV: 28, fol. 136c, where ibn Gabbai cites, without mentioning the source, the relevant text that appears in Be'ur le-Ferush ha-RaMBaN attributed to ibn Sahula. Further on in the same context ibn Gabbai cites by name Bahya ben Asher; see below, n. 81. For a discussion of ibn Gabbai's interpretation of Nahmanides, cf. R. Goetschel (supra n. 14), p. 412. The Secret of the Garment, p. 30. There is a closer semantic resemblance between Nahmanides' usage and the expression employed by the rabbis,נדמו לו כדמות אנשים (see Genesis Rabbah, 50:2, ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 517, and parallels cited in n. 4 ad loc.\ see also Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to Gen. 37:15, (גבריאל בדמות גברא), than there is between his usage and that of Maimonides. See Nahmanides' commentary on Num. 22:23 (cited below) where he refers to his doctrine of the garment in language that is clearly based on the expression of the midrash:המלאכים הנראים בדמות אנושי. Kitve Ramban, 1: 148.</page><page sequence="8">XXXII Elliot Wolfson the angels appear in the form of a man; in none of these cases is there any indication that Nahmanides intends to say that these angels derive specifically from the group called אישים. Even in the case of his commentary to Gen. 37:15, "A man came upon him wandering in the fields,יי when Nahmanides writes, "to this did our rabbis intend when they said these men are angels," the word men, אישים, definitely does not refer there to a specific class of angels. Nahmanides is simply paraphrasing a comment in Genesis Rabbah to the effect that the three occurrences of the word איש in Gen. 37:15 and 17 correspond to the three angels who accompanied Joseph.30 My conjecture is strengthened by Nahmanides' own brief reference to the doctrine of the malbush (though he does not mention it by name) in his commentary to Num. 22:23: "the angels who are seen in the image of men," 31.המלאכים הנראים בדמות אנושי Again, no reference is made to the technical expression employed by Maimonides, אישים. Having established that Nahmanides does not intend to limit the appearance of angels in human form to a specific class of angels, we must still clarify in a positive sense what he does intend by his reference to the garment. Let me begin by citing a critical passage in Genesis Rabbah that I believe served as the basis for Nahmanides' exegetical remark and to which he himself probably referred in his comment, "According to the opinion of our rabbis, this [involves] the created Glory in [the form of] the angels." [Why is it that] here [Gen. 19:1] it says angels (מלאכים) but later on [verse 5] it says men (אנשים)? Later on when the Shekhinah was upon them [they are] men (אנשים); when, however, the Shekhinah is removed from them, they are clothed in angelhood (32.(לבשו מלאכות Although Nahmanides does not specifically mention this particular aggadic statement, there are several good reasons to posit that it was this very statement which he had in mind when he said "according to the opinion of our rabbis etc."33 According to this aggadic tradition, when the Shekhinah is "upon" the Genesis Rabbah, 84:14, ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 1017. See above, n. 28. Genesis Rabbah, 50:2, ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 517. And see the reading of MS Paris 149 cited in the critical apparatus adloc.: □לבשו מלאכי. Interestingly enough, in his commentary on Gen. 18:1, Menahem Siyyoni alludes to this passage in Genesis Rabbah, but then makes the following comment: "Know that a [certain] mystic [or: one of esoteric knowledge,איש סודי] wrote that whenever the Shekhinah was over them [Scripture] referred to them as angels (מלאכים), but at times it called them humans (אנשים) after the disappearance of the Shekhinah (סילוק שכינה); this is understood by those who know." Cf. Sefer Siyyoni 'alha-Torah,io\. 10b. I have not been able to identify Siyyoni's reference to the איש סודי, the one of esoteric knowledge. It is curious, however, that this mystical interpretation reverses the position taken in the midrashic passage in Genesis Rabbah cited in the body of the paper. See, by contrast, the opinion of Chavel in his edition of Nahmanides' commentary, p. 106, n. 33, that the reference is to Genesis Rabbah 77:2 (77:3 in ed. Theodor-Albeck) where the verse</page><page sequence="9">The Secret of the Garment in Nahmanides XXXIII celestial emissaries they assume the form of human beings and hence are referred to as אנשים. When, however, the Shekhinah is removed from them, then they don the garment of angelhood, i.e., they appear in the form of angels.34 Hence, the appearance of the Shekhinah with these heavenly beings transforms their revelatory status from the lower level in which they are called angels to the higher one in which they are called humans.35 It is precisely this phenomenon, I submit, that Nahmanides alluded to in his words, כבוד נברא במלאכים, i.e., the Shekhinah, here, as elsewhere in Nahmanides1 writings,36 called by the Saadianic expression "created Glory,"37 can assume the form of angels, but when it does these angels appear as human beings. It is of interest to note that when Nahmanides mentions the doctrine of the garment in his commentary to Num. 22:23, already cited above, he uses the expression,המלאכים הנראים בדמות אנושי, which is itself based on a comment made in the very same context in Genesis Rabbah: 38.נדמו לו כדמות אנשים Therefore, when Scripture mentions angels in the name of human beings — במקום אשר יזכיר המלאכים בשם אנשים — what is really intended is the appearence of the Shekhinah, the created Glory, in the form of these angels. The point is well expressed in Nahmanides' commentary to Gen. 18:3, "He [Abraham] said, 'My Lord (אדנ''י), if it please you do not go past your servant': We have found [that the word אדנ"י] in the books [i.e., the Masoretic texts] "And a man wrestled with him" (Gen. 32:25) is interpreted as an allusion to the archon of Esau. And cf. M. Kasher, Torah Shelemah, vol. 6 (New York, 1948), p. 1412, n. 109, who suggests that Nahmanides' reference to the rabbis in his comment on the malbush is to the midrashic interpretation of Gen. 37:15, found in several sources, which renders the word "man" in the verse, "A man came upon him wandering in the fields," as Gabriel the angel. See below, n. 58. As noted already by Theodor in n. 4, ad loc. See, however, Genesis Rabbah, 21:9, ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 203. See esp. Perush 'al ha-Torah, Gen. 46:1 (ed. Chavel, 1: 250-51): "God forbid that the entity which is called Shekhinah or created Glory (כבוד נברא) is something distinct from God, blessed be He, as the rabbi [i.e., Maimonides] thought here [cf. Guide of the Perplexed, I, 27]... Jonathan ben Uziel translated [Ezek. 3:12, ,Blessed be the Glory from its place'] ,Blessed be the Glory of the Lord from the place of the inhabitation of the Shekhinah (כריך יקרא דה' מאתר בית שכינתיה). If by the [word] ,Glory' Scripture here intendes the essence and truth of the Creator... behold it says ,place' and ,inhabitation of the Shekhinah.' And if you say that the created Glory is like the view of the rabbi [i.e., a created entity]... how can the [word] ,blessed' be established [in the verse ,Blessed be the Glory of God from its place'] for the one who blesses and prays to a created Glory [understood in the Maimonidean sense] is like one who worships idols. In the words of the rabbis there are many things that show that the Shekhinah is God, blessed be He." From this context it is clear, therefore, that for Nahmanides the created Glory is not created at all, even though he employs the Saadianic terminology. Cf. A.

Thus it was that he [Abraham] called them by the name of their Master, with [the name] 'Alef-Dalet [i.e., אז-נ"י], for he recognized that they were angels of the Supernal One who are called by the names 'Elohim19 and 'Elim, therefore he bowed down to them.40 That Abraham addressed the angels by one of the names of the Shekhinah,אדנ"י, and even bowed down to them, is only comprehensible in light of the notion that I have been describing, viz., the Shekhinah appears in the form of these angels; hence the latter can be treated like the former. To put the matter in slightly different terms, the angels in this case are a special manifestation of Shekhinah, for if that were not so, then one would have to say that Abraham worshipped angels — in the sense of created beings — and this, as Nahmanides himself informs us in his commentary to Exod. 20:3, is one of the three cardinal forms of idolatry prohibited by the commandment, 'You shall have no other gods (אלהים אחרים) besides Me.' Indeed, in that context Nahmanides emphasizes that this kind of idolatry applied to those who worshipped angels "even though they acknowledged that the great strength and absolute power belonged to the Supernal God."41 It therefore cannot be said that Abraham, the supreme believer and father of monotheism, would have bowed down to the angels and addressed them as 'Lord.' An interpretation of Nahmanides which amounts to such a reading of the biblical verse must be incorrect. It thus seems to me that Nahmanides' point is that the Shekhinah, who is disclosed in the likeness of the angels, is the one addressed and worshipped by Abraham. The capacity of the divine Presence to appear to human beings in the anthropomorphic form of an angel is the esoteric doctrine of the garment to which Nahmanides alludes. It is reasonable to assume, moreover, that the word מלבוש was suggested to Nahmanides by the expression used in the passage from Genesis Rabbah cited above, לבשו מלאכות, even though in that case it refers to the status of the angels after the Shekhinah is removed from them. Indeed, it seems to me that even this last idea, the removal of the Shekhinah, expressed in the midrash in the words כיון שנסתלקה שכינה, is alluded to in Nahmanides' remark in the continuation of his commentary to Gen. 18:1: Concerning the matter of their eating [see Gen. 18:5-8] the sages have said, '[Did they really eat? It seemed as if they ate,] one [course] after the 39 Cf. Nahmanides, Perush 'al ha-Torah, Exod. 20:3; Lev. 18:25.

The angel suggests instead that Manoah offer a burnt-offering to God. When Manoah indeed offers the sacrifice to God the following miraculous event occurs: "Manoah took the kid and the meal offering and offered them up on the rock to the Lord; and a marvelous thing happened... As the flames leaped up from the altar toward the sky, the angel of the Lord ascended in the flames of the altar..." (19-20). The ascension of the angel of the Lord in this text is an example of the "disappearance" to which Nahmanides refers in his commentary to Gen. 18:1. He insightfully makes a connection between this biblical episode and the rabbinic interpretation in Genesis Rabbah concerning the account of the three men, or angels, who visitied Abraham and consumed food. The connection is based on the fact that just as the rabbis used the expression for disappearing (ראשון ראשון מסתלק) to explain the mere appearance of the angels eating, so in the case of Manoah the issue of an angel's eating (or the sacrifice which replaces it) is linked with the angel's vanishing, though here the technical expression of הסתלקות is not used. Now, insofar as the title "angel of the Lord"(מלאך יהו"ה) in Nahmanides' writings is one of the standard names for the Shekhinah*5 we can take the further step and assert that the phenomenon of the "disappearance" in the episode of Manoah refers to the vanishing of the Shekhinah. It is precisely such a phenomenon that is described in the second part of the passage from Genesis Rabbah ("when, however, the Shekhinah is removed from them they are clothed in angelhood") which, as I have suggested, served as the basis for Genesis Rabbah, 48:14; ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 491. Nahmanides, Perush 'al ha-Torah, Gen. 18:1 (ed. Chavel, p. 106). To be sure, the motif of the disappearance or vanishing of the Presence, הסתלקות השכינה, is repeated in many rabbinic sources. See Ε. E. Urbach, The Sages, Their Concepts and Beliefs (Jerusalem, 1978), pp. 42-44 [in Hebrew]. It seems to me, however, that in this particular case Nahmanides was influenced by the passage from Genesis Rabbah that I have suggested. The appearance in that passage of all the key terms mentioned by Nahmanides is not coincidental. Cf. Perush 'al ha-Torah, Gen. 22:12; Exod. 14:19.</page><page sequence="12">XXXVI Elliot Wolfson Nahmanides' comments regarding the malbush. Nahmanides finds a reference to this phenomenon in the aggadic explanation of the eating as it is described in Genesis 18:5-8, which he then connects to the account of the disappearance of the angel of the Lord in Judges 13:20. Hence, Nahmanides is able to find in the narrative of Abraham's vision of the three men an allusion to both the manifestation of the Shekhinah (symbolized by the מלבוש) and Her removal (הסתלקות). The secret of the garment refers, therefore, to the disclosure of the Shekhinah, the last of the divine gradations, in the anthropomorphic form of angels. That is to say, in those cases where Scripture records that angels assumed a human form the word 'angel' does not signify a separate intellect in the conventional philosophical sense (accepted by Nahmanides as well),46 but rather a manifestation of the divine Presence. A striking example of this can be drawn from Nahmanides' kabbalistic reading of Exod. 3:2, 'An angel of the Lord appeared to him [Moses] in a blazing fire out of a bush.' Initially, Nahmanides offers an aggadic interpretation based on a passage in Exodus Rabbah*1 which is, in turn, based on a passage in Genesis Rabbah,AS the source cited by Nahmanides. Our rabbis said in Genesis Rabbah. 'Angel' [in Exod. 3:2] refers to Michael... in every place that Michael is seen there is the Glory of the divine Presence (כבוד השכינה). The rabbis intended to say that at first Michael appeared to him [Moses] and there was the Glory of the divine Presence, but he did see the Glory because he had not prepared his mind for prophecy. But when he prepared his mind and 'he turned aside to look' (Exod. 3:4), the vision of the divine Presence (מראה השכינה) was revealed to him, and 'God (אלהים) called to him out of the bush' (ibid.).49 According to this interpretation, then, the angel of the Lord mentioned in Scripture is an actual angel, viz., Michael, but, additionally, Moses beheld the divine Presence, for, as the rabbis had said, wherever Michael was to be seen there the Shekhinah itself was also to be seen. At first, however, Moses, who was not yet prepared for prophecy, saw only Michael; only afterwards was the prophetic vision of God revealed to him. Juxtaposed to this midrashic interpretation, Nahmanides proposes the following kabbalistic explanation: By way of truth this angel is the redeeming angel (מלאך הגואל) of whom it is said, 'for My name is in him' (Exod. 23:21), and it is the one who said to Jacob, '1 am the God of Beth-el' (Gen. 31:13), and concerning this one it is said, 'and God (אלהים) called to him' (Exod. 3:4). This attribute [of God, 46 For reference, see above, n. 11. 47 Exodus Rabbah, 2:5 and 32:9. The proper reference was already noted by Chavel in his notes to Nahmanides' commentary, ad loc. 48 Genesis Rabbah, 97:3, ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 1246. 49 Perush 'al-Torah, Exod. 3:2 (ed. Chavel 1:287).</page><page sequence="13">The Secret of the Garment in Nahmanides XXXVII viz. the Shekhinah] is called angel with respect to the governance of the world (50.(בהנהגת העולם Whereas the midrashic reading preserves two distinct entitites, the archangel Michael and the divine Presence, the kabbalistic reading collapses the two into one entity, the Shekhinah. That is, the angel of the Lord who is seen by Moses (Exod. 3:2) is identical with God (אלהים) who calls out to him, for both refer to the divine Presence. When one knows how to read the text kabbalistically, then one understands that the angel of the Lord is the manifestation of the divine Presence in a prophetic state, and not a created being distinct from God. Although the word מלבוש is not used here, nor even any approximating it, this text nevertheless provides a good example of the phenomenon that I believe underlies Nahmanides' secret doctrine of the garment: the appearance of the Shekhinah in the garb of an angelic hypostasis. That the word 'angel' in the Torah often has the connotation of Shekhinah is a point that Nahmanides repeats in several exegetical contexts. Some of the more frequent titles by which the Shekhinah is designated are: "the angel of God"(מלאך האלהים), "the angel of the Lord" (מלאך ה'), "the redeeming angel" (מלאך הגואל), "the great angel" (מלאך הגדול), "the first angel" (מלאך הראשון), and "the angel of the covenant" (51.(מלאך הברית At the end of the passage cited in the preceding paragraph we are told by Ibid.

On this tradition in the Nahmanidean kabbalah, see, e.g., Ma'arekhet ha-'Elohut (Jerusalem, 1963), fols. 72b and 185b; Isaac of Acre, Sefer Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 82; Be'ur le-Ferush ha RaMBaN, fol. 13a; Recantai, Perush 'alha-Torah, fol. 43b.

Verman, Sifrei ha-Iyyun (Ph.D., Harvard University, 1984), p. 30. See also Zohar 3: 187a (Yenuqa'), published in the Cremona edition ofZohar, Genesis, p. 487, and Deuteronomy, p. 487.

Cf. Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, p. 299, n. 198. This tradition is repeated verbatim in a collectanea of kabbalistic material from the school of R. Solomon ibn Adret extant in MS.

See also the Proven?al document discussed by Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah,p. 225, according to which the tenth emanation is described as the angelic Prince of the Divine Countenance or Prince of the World who speaks to prophets in God's name. This is probably related to another idea common in the thirteenth-century kabbalistic sources, viz., the identification of Shekhinah and Metafron;see Scholem, op. cit.,pp. 171,187,n. 214,214-15,299;B.Septimus,Hispano-Jewish Culture in Transition (Cambridge, 1982), p. 167, n. 14.</page><page sequence="14">XXXVIII Elliot Wolfson Nahmanides why, in his opinion, the Shekhinah is, in fact, referred to in Scripture as an angel. In another context Nahmanides reiterates the same point: "And Scripture calls it an angel because all the governance of the world (הנהגת העולם) is dependent on this attribute [i.e., the divine Presence]."52 The Shekhinah is thus called angel because of Her special providential role in the governance of the physical world.53 The latter usage also underlies Nahmanides' identification of Metatron, or as he puts it in one context, the "great Metatron,"54 as the divine Presence, for, according to the etymology accepted by Nahmanides, Metatron means the "guide of the road," 55,מורה הדרך a term which likewise signifies God's providence.56 It is of interest to note that in connection with one of the passages that Nahmanides enumerated in his commentary to Gen. 18:1 as an example of the anthropomorphic manifestation of an "angel," we find this very usage: "Ά man came upon him [Joseph] wandering in the fields' (Gen. 37:15)... for the Holy One, blessed be He, sent him a guide (מורה דרך) without his knowledge in order to bring him into their hands, and to this the rabbis intended when they said57 that these men were angels."58 Perush 'al ha-Torah, Exod. 23:20. On the special providential role of Shekhinah, see, e.g., Nahmanides' commentary on Gen. 24:1, 46:1; Exod. 3:13, 23:20; Lev. 18:25. Perush 'al ha-Torah, Exod. 24:1. Cf. Ch. Henoch, Nachmanides Philosopher and Mystic (Jerusalem, 1978), p. 265, n. 258 [in Hebrew]. As Nahmanides himself points out in his commentary on Exod. 12:12, this supposed etymology of Metatron, from the Latin metator, meaning measurer or one who marks out, is already to be found in rabbinic sources, e.g., Sifre Deuteronomy 338, but there it has no connection to Metatron the angel. In the aformentioned context Nahmanides also notes the more widely supposed etymology of Metatron in medieval sources from the Greek metator meaning messenger. On this latter etymology, see Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, pp. 298-99. See also M. Idel, R. Abraham Abulafia's Works and Doctrine (Ph.D., Hebrew University, 1976), p. 89 [in Hebrew]. A recent attempt to substantiate this supposed etymology of Metatron from the Latin metator, combined perhaps with the Greek metron, has been made by G. Stroumsa, "Form(s) of God: Some Notes on Metatron and Christ," Harvard Theological Review 76 (1983): 287. For another account of this etymology as deriving from the Greek synthronos (equivalent to metathronos), see S. Lieberman's appendix in I. Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (Leiden, 1980), pp. 235-40. See esp. Nahmanides' commentary on Exod. 12:12,23:20, and 24:1 (in this context, however, the term מורה הדרך is applied to the angelic Metatron who is distinguished from the "great Metatron," which is another name for the Divine Presence). See references in n. 53. See also Shem Τον ibn Gaon, Keter Shem Τον, in Ma'or wa-Shemesh, ed. J. Koriat (Livorno, 1839), fol. 26b. Genesis Rabbah, 84:14, ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 1017. Perush 'al ha-Torah, Gen. 37:15 (ed. Chavel, 1:209). The possible connection between this angelic being, referred to as the מורה הדרך (as in the commentary to Exod. 24:1; seen. 56), and Metatron is enhanced by the midrashic tradition on Gen. 37:15, Ά man came upon him,' which identifies the "man" as Gabriel. Cf. Targum Pseudo-Jonathan (see above, nn. 28 and</page><page sequence="15">The Secret of the Garment in Nahmanides XXXIX The sages already understood the reference to the man in this verse as corresponding to an angel. Nahmanides adds, however, that the unique status of the angel, appearing in this anthropomorphic form, is that he is a guide, i.e., he is a manifestation of God,s individual providence, a quality that is, in turn, especially entrusted to the Shekhinah. Hence, once again we see that, for Nahmanides, the corporeal appearance of the angel is related to a particular revelation of the divine Presence. It is this same tradition which, as I have tried to argue, underlies Nahmanides' allusion to the secret of the garment.59 The interpretation I am here offering is corroborated by a suggestion made by Shlomo Pines in his essay, "God, the Divine Glory and the Angels according to a Second Century Theology." According to Pines, Nahmanides' conception of the Divine Glory as that which is not distinct from God yet appears to human beings in various forms is an echo of an older, presumably Jewish, tradition reported by Justin Martyr (110-65). Although Pines does not specifically mention Nahmanides' doctrine of the garment in his commentary to Gen. 18:1, it seems to me that this passage, if my interpretation is correct, brings Nahmanides' position even closer to that reported by Justin for according to that tradition the Glory, which is not separate from God, appears to human beings at times in the form of angels. This is precisely the essence of Nahmanides' esoteric doctrine of the garment. The connotation of the word 'angels' in the critical expression, כבוד נברא במלאכים, therefore must be taken as a reference to particular manifestations of the Shekhinah rather than created separate intellects. Moreover, insofar as the biblical descriptions of the appearance of an angel in human form refer to a special disclosure of the Shekhinah, it follows that such accounts are indeed reports of prophetic experiences. Nahmanides has thus provided the reader with a typology wherein he can still preserve the prophetic status of the angelic revelation, but at the same time reject Maimonides' interpretation of these states as purely imaginary. The interpretation that I have suggested seems to me to be confirmed by Nahmanides' assertion immediately following his 33) and the commentary of Rashi ad loc.; Tanhuma, Wayeshev, 2. See also the midrashic passage cited by M. Kasher, Torah Shelemah, vol. 6, p. 1412, n. 110. That Nahmanides identified the angelic Metatron as Gabriel is clear from his commentary to Exod. 23:20 (ed. Chavel, 1:443). Such an identification is known from other thirteenth-century Jewish mystical sources, both theosophic (e.g., Moses ben Simon of Burgos) and non-theosophic (Gikatilla and Abulafia). For references, see A. Farber, "On the Sources of Moses de Leon's Early Kabbalistic System," in Studies in Jewish Mysticism, Philosophy, and Ethical Literature presented to Isaiah Tishby, pp. 84, n. 36 and 86, n. 43. Cf. S. Pines, "God, the Divine Glory and the Angels according to a Second Century Theology," in the "Proceedings of the Second International Conference on the History of Jewish Mysticism," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 6 (1987): 11-12 [in Hebrew].</page><page sequence="16">XL Elliot Wolfson statement that he cannot explain the secret of the garment: "And in the place [in Scripture] where you find the seeing of the Lord and the speech of the angel (ראיית ה' ודבור מלאך) or the seeing of an angel and the speech of the Lord (ראיית מלאך ודבור ה'), as it is written in the words of Moses in the beginning of his prophecy60 and in the words of Zechariah;61 I will yet reveal regarding this the words of the living God through allusions."62 For Nahmanides, then, the appearance of an angel is not to be counted as a prophetic state unless it is specified that the angel appears in the form of a human being. In such a case what is being apprehended is not an angel, i.e., a created entity, but rather the Shekhinah, the standard locus of prophecy for all prophets with perhaps the exception of Moses.63 Nevertheless, it is the case that every prophetic moment incorporates two attributes of God, the masculine and feminine, represented respectively by the Tetragrammaton and the angel.64 There are different degrees of prophecy: for Moses the visionary component is linked to the Tetragrammaton, the attribute of mercy, and the auditory to the angel, the attribute of judgment, whereas for other prophets, like Zechariah, the relationship is reversed. This is alluded to in Nahmanides5 comment, "where you find the seeing of the Lord and the speech of an angel or the seeing of an angel and the speech of the Lord.5' Both of the attributes mentioned by Nahmanides are operative in one degree or another in the prophetic process.65 The point is well made by Menahem Recanati in his commentary to Gen. 18:1: "The intention of the Rabbi [Nahmanides], of blessed memory, [in his words] 'the seeing of an angel and the speech of the Lord' is [to allude to] the two countenaces (דיו פרצופין) [i.e., Tiferet, the attribute of mercy, and Shekhinah, the attribute of judgment] for the power of prophecy proceeds from there, as it says, 'And now the Lord God (יהוה אלהים) [i.e., both the masculine and feminine attributes] has sent me, endowed with His spirit' (Isa. 48:16)."66 This interpretation substantiates my hypothesis that the phenomenon of the garment in Nahmanides refers to the embodiment of Shekhinah in an anthropomorphic form called an angel. Cf. Exod. 3:2: "An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing fire out of a bush." Cf. Zech. 1:14: "Then the angel who talked with me said to me: 'Proclaim! Thus said the Lord of Hosts: I am very jealous for Jerusalem etc." Perush 'al ha-Torah, Gen. 18:1 (ed. Chavel, 1:106). See ibid. Exod. 3:2, 25:3; Num. 12:6. Cf. Keter Shem Τον, fol. 30b.

Recanati, Perush 'a! ha-Torah, fol. 24a.</page><page sequence="17">The Secret of the Garment in Nahmanides XLI III There is, as far as I can tell, only one other place in Nahmanides' commentary on the Torah where he uses an expression that approximates that of the 671.מלבוש am referring to another very terse and enigmatic remark that Nahmanides offers in his commentary to Gen. 49:33, where he sets out to explain the aggadic tradition68 that Jacob did not suffer physical death: '"The [kabbalistic] explanation [literally, matter] of this midrash is that the souls of the righteous are bound to the bundle of life,69 and this [soul] of Jacob hovered over him all day,70 and it clothed itself with a second garment71 (לובשת לבוש השני), so that he would not be stripped naked,72 while [others] are clothed in set times."73 Here the focus is not the explanation of angelic revelations, but rather the ontic status of the souls of the righteous after the death of the body. The meaning of this passage, as well as the attempts of various commentaries who sought to explain it, have been discussed in detail by Scholem.74 I do not wish to enter here into a lengthy discussion of Nahmanides' eschatology. What is significant for my purposes is the fact that Nahmanides speaks of the soul putting on a second garment, using an expression that is reminiscent of the term he used in the context of describing the clothing of the created Glory or Shekhinah in human form. It is of interest to note that the connection between these two passages was already made by some of Nahmanides' commentators. Thus, for example, according to the "view of the wise one" (ודעת החכם), printed in Shem Τον ibn Gaon's Keter Shem Τον but representing a separate tradition,75 the garment to which Nahmanides referred in his commentary to Gen. 18:1 is the subtle aetheral (or astral) body with which the soul of the righteous is clad after the death of the coarse body.76 According to See also Nahmanides, .PerasA 'alha-Torah,Gen. l:l(ed. Chavel, l:12and 14) where God is said to clothe the prime matter with forms. In that case the matter is said to be clothed in the form rather than the form in the matter. This is a reversal of the standard Neoplatonic conception where the lower entity in the hierarchical chain is the garment or shell of that which is above it. Cf. Altmann, Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism, pp. 177-78. See the criticism of Nahmanides on this point by Yom Τον ben Abraham Ishbili, Sefer ha-Zikkaron (Jerusalem, 1982), p. 51. Cf. b.

Thus the passage from the "wise one" continues: "At times [the souls of the righteous clad in the garment] become messengers for God in the manner of the angels, and they are actually called men." This view is affirmed as well by an anonymous kabbalist whose explanations on Nahmanides' mystical allusions — largely reported in the name of Kabbalat Saporta77 — are extant in MS. Oxford 1645,78 and is elaborated further by Isaac of Acre according to what he received from his teacher.79 A trace of this exegetical tradition is found in Menahem Recanati as well for he mentions the garment that the righteous wear in Paradise, the haluqa' de-rabbanan, in conjunction with the malbush that the angels don in their descent to the world.80 IV Support for my interpretation of Nahmanides may be gathered from some of the standard commentators on his Torah commentary. Thus, Bahya ben Asher in his commentary on Gen. 18:1 writes: ... the meaning of these angels, referred to as human beings, is that the created Glory [i.e., the Shekhinah] is in the angels, and the knowers of truth call this the מלבוש, for it is a garment for the upper three gradations which are called Adam, for they are clothed within this gradation that is called מלבוש. Since the destruction of the Temple this gradation, which is the מלבוש, has fallen... In all the places [in Scripture] where angels are called by the name אנשים the intention is to this מלבוש. Scripture calls them by the name אנשים because it is apprehended by the eyes of those who are pure souls. And this is the reason why in this section they are called both human beings (אנשים) and angels (מלאכים), angels because they are actually angels, human beings because they are angels which are called 81.מלבוש Cf.

On the one hand, according to Bahya, the מלבוש clearly refers to the Shekhinah which is characterized as the garment for the upper three gradations called Adam, a likely reference to the central seflrot of Hesed, Din, and Rahamim, which represent the central part of the divine anthropos. I have found no basis for the latter part of Bahya's description in Nahmanides himself, nor have I found such an interpretation in any other of the standard commentaries on Nahmanides. There is, however, a striking parallel to Bahya's view in Moses de Leon's Sheqelha-Qodesh (1292) where the supernal Adam who sits upon the throne is identified as the union of three gradations, viz., the three central sefirot, and the garment in which this Adam is clothed is identified as the "attribute of the West" (מדת מערב), i.e., the Shekhinah. This is alternatively expressed by de Leon in terms of the divine names: YHWH (which corresponds to the masculine Adam) is clothed in the name 'Adonai (which corresponds to the feminine Shekhinah)}2 That מלבוש corresponds to the Shekhinah may be further adduced from Bahya's statement that the divine grade to which the garment refers has fallen since the destruction of the Temple,83 an image applied to Shekhinah in a host of kabbalistic texts. Hence, it would seem that the מלבוש is simply the Shekhinah. Yet, Bahya also suggests that the phenomenon of the מלבוש refers to the embodiment of the Shekhinah in actual angels who are called אנשים because they are apprehended by human eyes. Scripture employs both terms, אנשים and מלאכים, to characterize these beings because they are angels who are the מלבוש, i.e., the anthropomorphic manifestation of the divine Presence. If we turn to the commentary of Shem Τον ibn Gaon, the Keter Shem Τον, we find a similar effort to disclose Nahmanides' teaching along the lines that I have suggested, although it strikes me that in this case there is something of a departure from Nahmanides himself. Thus, initially, ibn Gaon reports a tradition regarding the מלבוש that he received from his teacher, Isaac ben Todros. According to this tradition, Nahmanides' teaching was explained in the following way: a garment was placed on top of a form made from wax, over which an oath was made, resulting in the vision of an angel or the divine speech. At this point ibn Gaon comments: "The intention is that 'Atarah [i.e., the Shekhinah] is called angel; the word 'angel' here alludes to this [attribute, i.e., the Moses de Leon, Sheqel ha-Qodesh, ed. A. W. Grenup (London, 1911), pp. 33-34. In this context de Leon cites a passage from the Sitre Torah in Aramaic that is very much in the form and style of the Zohar. To date, however, I have not been able to locate an exact source in the published editions of the Zohar. Cf. Sheqel ha-Qodesh, p. 34, where de Leon likewise employs the image of the destruction of the Temple in the context of describing the Shekhinah as the garment.</page><page sequence="20">XLIV Elliot Wolfson Shekhinah] and the name of God [the Tetragrammaton] to Tiferet."84 From this it would appear that the view of Isaac ben Todros, as reported and interpreted by ibn Gaon, is that when Nahmanides speaks about the angel in human form the reference is to the Shekhinah. Yet, a bit further on in the same commentary ibn Gaon remarks that Nahmanides "called the angels by the name 'Atarah... for the angels emanated from 'Atarah."85 From this comment it seems as if ibn Gaon,s own view is that the angels who are clothed in human form are not the Shekhinah per se, but rather are called by one of the names of Shekhinah, viz., 'Atarah, because they emanate from that divine grade. According to the latter interpretation, the secret of the garment refers to angels and not the divine Presence. Finally, in his commentary on Gen 18:1, Recanati initially interprets the seeing of an angel mentioned here as a vision of Shekhinah. On the other hand, in the continuation of his commentary he explains the phenomenon of the garment in terms of the idea that the angel, a created spiritual being, assumes a corporeal form in its descent to the world. In Recanati's case, moreover, the latter idea is related explicitly to the relevant passages in the Zohar which he cites by name.86 Interestingly enough, in the case of some of the other supercommentaries on Nahmanides only the latter explanation is given. Thus, as we have already seen, in the commentary attributed to ibn Sahula the מלבוש is explained in terms of a subtle aetheral body in which a specific group of angels called אנשים, presumably corresponding to Maimonides' אישים, are clothed when they appear to select individuals. The author of this commentary adds that his teacher, probably a reference to R. Solomon ibn Adret, explained that Nahmanides' qualifying statement that the angels, at least according to this interpretation, were revealed to the pure souls refers only to the possibility of a "permanent" vision, i.e., at any time without special preparation; in theory, however, any person could at some time behold these angels. A similar explanation of Nahmanides' comment is alluded to very briefly by Joshua ibn Shu'aib in his homilies on the Torah: "By means of the merit of circumcision the supernal angels were revealed to Abraham in the image of men."87 Although there is no explicit reference to Nahmanides, it is clear from the langauge that ibn Shu'aib has Nahmanides in Keter Shem Τον, fol. 30b. The view that the angelic powers derive from the tenth sefirah is a tradition attributed to Isaac the Blind in R. Ezra's Perush ha-'Aggadot, MS Vat. 294, fol. 48b. See Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, pp. 298-99, n. 190. Ibid., fol. 31a. Recanati, Perush 'al ha-Torah, fols. 24a-b. Recanati cites Zohar 1: 19a and another passage which I have not yet located.

His particular reading of the latter is in accord with what we have found in Be'ur Sodot ha-RaMBaN, attributed to ibn Sahula: the phenomenon to which Nahmanides referred in his mentioning of the garment is the appearance of angels in human form. Moreover, as we noted at the outset, this interpretation of Nahmanides is found as well in Moses de Leon's Sefer ha-Rimmon, composed in 1287. Indeed, as far as I can tell, de Leon was one of the first kabbalists — at least in terms of literary chronology — to mention Nahmanides explicitly in the context of elaborating upon the doctrine of angels taking on a corporeal human form.88 Here it would be beneficial to cite the critical part of de Leon's text: "When the angel, an intelligble spirit, is sent from the curtain of the great King to this world, before he completes his mission he is clothed in the garment of this physical world (מתלבש במלבוש זה העולם הטבעי) as the soul is clothed in the body... Thus do not wonder that the angel of the Lord appears to men for the angels are clothed in the garment of this world."89 The view of de Leon is repeated on numerous occasions in the body of the Zohar.90 I will here mention but two passages in which this motif appears. Commenting on the nature of the three "men" who appeared to Abraham after his circumcision, the author of the Zohar writes: "When these holy spirits [angels] descended to the world they were clothed in the air and the corporeal elements, and they actually appeared to men in their image."91 As a more general principle, we read in another context: Already in 1279 Abulafia referred to the "masters of the garment"(בעלי המלבוש); see Μ. !del, "The World of Angels," p. 47. See also the statement of Joseph Gikatilla in his Perush le Mirkevet Yehezqel, cited by Idel, op. cit., pp. 44-45, where he refers to the "groups of the garment" (כיתות המלבוש) who believed that "there are some angels who are clothed in a garment that is close to the human eyes." Gikatilla's text was written sometime in the latter part of the 1280's and before 1291. Such an interpretation of Nahmanides' secret of the garment seems to be implied as well in Gikatilla,s Sha'are Orah, ed. Ben-Shlomo, 1: 161; cf. Goetschel, "The Conception of Prophecy in the Works of R. Moses de Leon and R. Joseph Gikatilla," p. 224, n. 30. In the case of Gikatilla, moreover, it stands to reason that there is a Zoharic influence. Cf. A. Farber, "Traces of the Zohar in the Writings of Joseph Gikatilla," 'Alei Sefer 9 (1981): 70-83 [in Hebrew]. For a different view on the relationship between Gikatilla and de Leon, see E. Gottlieb, Mehqarim be-Sifrut ha-Qabbalah (Tel-Aviv, 1976), pp. 97-98; Y. Liebes, "How the Zohar was Written," in the "Proceedings of the Third International Conference on the History of Jewish Mysticism," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 8 (1989): 20, n. 74 [in Hebrew], Wolfson, The Book of the Pomegranate, p. 316 (Hebrew section).

If they were not clothed in the garment of this world, they could not exist or endure in this world.'"2 When comparing de Leon's view with that of Nahmanides, Cohen-Alloro concluded that the critical difference lies in the fact that de Leon, in both his Hebrew writings and the Zohar, affirms a much broader concept than the more restricted position of Nahmanides. This is apparent in two ways: first, de Leon applies the phenomenon of the garment to all angels, whereas Nahmanides supposedly limited this phenomenon to a specific class of angels, the 93.אישים Secondly, Cohen-Alloro suggests that for de Leon the possibility of seeing the angel in the fleshly garment was opened to every person, whereas Nahmanides seems to have limited such a vision to the select few, the "pious" and the "sons of prophets."94 In fact, it can be shown that both of these conclusions are incorrect. In the first place there is simply no indication whatsoever from Nahmanides himself that he sought to limit the phenomenon of the garment to one class of angels; indeed, such an interpretation is based on a misreading of his language. Second, it does not seem to me that Nahmanides was at all speaking in a straightforward way about the appearance of angels in human form. As I have argued, the term angel in the critical phrase כבוד נברא במלאכים is a reference to a particular manifestation of the Shekhinah rather than to some created entity, albeit of a spiritual or intelligible nature. It may be concluded, therefore, that Nahmanides' reference to the secret of the garment should not be interpreted in light of the doctrine of angels taking on an anthropomorphic form in their descent to this world. While some of the standard commentators on Nahmanides interpreted the latter in accord with this alternative approach, still others did transmit what I consider to be the correct understanding of the garment according to Nahmanides, viz., the appearance of the divine Presence in the anthropomorphic form of an angel. Two other passages in Nahmanides' writings are relevant to our discussion and need to be examined carefully in order to determine if Nahmanides in any place affirmed the doctrine attributed to him by later authorities. The first passage occurs in Nahmanides' commentary to Gen. 6:4 regarding the nefilim who reportedly inhabited the earth. After explaining the literal sense of the verse, Nahmanides turns his attention to an aggadic passage in the 92 Zohar 3:152a. 93 See Cohen-AIloro, The Secret of the Garment, p. 30. 94 Ibid., p. 37.</page><page sequence="23">The Secret of the Garment in Nahmanides XLVII collection, Pirqe Rabbi 'Eli'ezer, where it is stated that these nefilim were angels "who fell from their place of holiness in heaven."95 This explanation, observes Nahmanides, "best fits the language of the text, but there is a need to elaborate on the secret of this matter." As David Berger has already noted,96 this is clearly an example of the convergence of the exoteric and esoteric levels of meaning in Nahmanides' commentary, for in this case the secret contained in the aggadic statement can best account for the language of Scripture. Implicit here is the view of the fallen angel who assumes a human form upon his descent from the place of holiness to the material world. Can we consider this an example of the phenomenon of the garment to which Nahmanides refers in his commentary to Gen. 18:1? Nahmanides does not elaborate on the nature of the secret,97 and, more importantly, he does not employ the technical term מלבוש, or anything related to it, in this context.98 While the older mythological motif of the fallen angels is connected in the Zohar with the more general idea of angels assuming corporeal form,99 there is no conclusive evidence that Nahmanides' comments on the nefilim should be read in this light. There is, finally, one other context in which the corporealization of the angel in the garment of the mundane world may be implied. In his sermon, Torat ha Shem Temimah, Nahmanides refers to a responsum of Hai Gaon on the various levels of angelic beings. According to this source there are angels "who dwell Pirqe Rabbi 'Eli'ezer, ch. 22. See reference in n. 17. Cf. Be'ur le-Ferush ha-RaMBaN, fol. 3c, where it is stated that the kabbalistic explanation of Nahmanides' allusion cannot be transmitted in writing. However, from the biblical texts that are cited, it would appear that the esoteric teaching has something to do with demonic beings. Cf. Isaac of Acre, Sefer Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 37, who says that he has not received any tradition concerning Nahmanides' allusion, but only a midrash regarding the fall of Shamhazai and Azael from heaven. R. Isaac does not wish to elaborate because it is a lengthy matter, and not because there is any kabbalistic secret here. He then reports that his teacher told him that at the end of Nahmanides' life R. Sheshet went to Acre to visit him and inquired of him about this esoteric teaching. Nahmanides reportedly replied that he no longer remembered it, having relied in his youth on his sharp memory without in any way alluding to it. Cf. M. Idel, "We Have No Kabbalistic Tradition on This," pp. 62-63. If this account is trustworthy, it seems very unlikely that the secret here has anything to do with the garment, a doctrine that Nahmanides surely recalled even in the later part of his life, as is attested by his commentary on Gen. 18:1. The only commentator who clearly understands Nahmanides' allusion here in terms of the doctrine of the garment assumed by the angel in his descent to the world is Recanati; see his Perush 'al ha-Torah, fol. 17d. In his case, however, it is abundantly clear that he has been influenced by the Zohar, selections from which he explicitly cites. For references, cf. Cohen-Alloro, The Secret of the Garment, pp. 34-36. As the author points out, there is an interesting parallel to the Zoharic view in Sefer ha-Hayyim, a German Pietistic work.</page><page sequence="24">XLVIII Elliot Wolfson on earth and they are called spirits (רוחות), and these are clothed in a body (מתלבשים בגוף), caught [therein] as the air is caught in skin-bottles.'"00 Prima facie, it would seem reasonable to explain Nahmanides' reference to the מלבוש in his commentary to Gen. 18:1 in light of this passage. In the reconstruction of Nahmanides' doctrine of the garment this factor has weighed heavily in my mind, but the force of the evidence that I have marshaled has led me to conclude that, despite the similarity in terminology, the two texts are not addressing the same phenomenon, and it is thus incorrect to understand the remark concerning the garment in the Torah commentary in terms of what was stated in the aforementioned sermon. The critical specification which Nahmanides makes in his account of the מלבוש, viz., that the angels (significantly called מלאכים and not רוחות) appear in human form is not mentioned in the passage of Hai Gaon as cited in Torat ha-Shem Temimah. I see no necessity, therefore, to interpret the comment in the latter, מתלבשים בגוף, as referring to the enclosure of these angelic spirits in a human body; it may simply refer to the fact that the angelic spirits who carry out the divine will in the mundane world are manifest in all sorts of natural — and hence corporeal — phenomena.101 In order to substantiate the claim that the comment attributed to Hai Gaon in Torat ha Shem Temimah can help us understand the reference to the מלבוש in Nahmanides' Torah commentary, it would be necessary to prove demonstrably that the expression מתלבשים בגוף does indeed refer to the unique manifestation of the angelic spirits in the form of a human body. In the final analysis, it seems to me that Nahmanides' doctrine of the מלבוש represents another tradition which has been confused, both in Nahmanides' time and in our own, with the idea of an angelic garment which was popularized by the circle of the Zohar. This notion is mentioned by various authors in the latter part of the thirteenth century, including Abraham Abulafia,102 Joseph Gikatilla,103 Moses de Leon, and the Zohar. It is not impossible that some of the kabbalists from the school of the Rashba interpreted Nahmanides in light of an idea that originated in other circles, particularly that of the Zohar. Before a definitive conclusion on this matter is reached, however, a separate detailed Kitve Ramban, 1:149. Cf. Osar ha-Ge'onim, ed. Β. M. Lewin, vol. X, Tractate Gittin (Jerusalem, 1951), p. 238. See also reference to Sirat in following note. Cf. Maimonides' remark in Guide of the Perplexed, II, 6: "every force appertaining to the bodily forces is an angel — all the more, the forces distributed in the world." There may be an affinity between Maimonides' view and that which Nahmanides attributes to Hai Gaon, but the matter requires further research. For a brief statement of Hai Gaon's understanding of the angelic world, see C. Sirat, A History of Jewish Philosophy in the Middle Ages (Cambridge, 1985), p. 36. See above n. 88. Ibid.</page><page sequence="25">The Secret of the Garment in Nahmanides XLIX investigation on the possible influence of the Zohar, or related literature, on the members of the Rashba's circle must be undertaken.104 104 That there is such an influence can be shown from collections of kabbalistic material from this circle that have survived in various manuscripts. See, e.g., M. Idel, "An Unknown Commentary to the Mystical Secrets of Nahmanides," Da'at 2-3 (1978-79): 126, n. 17 [in Hebrew]. See, however, Idel's formulation, op. cit., pp. 121-22, and the position taken by him in "We Have No Kabbalistic Tradition on This," pp. 51-73. In the case of some of these kabbalists the Zohar was even cited. For the use of Zohar in Joshua ibn Shu'aib, see Scholem, Kabbalah, p. 213, and the more careful analysis in S. Abramson, "Introduction," to Joshua ibn Shu'aib,Derashot 'alha-Torah, pp. 15-16. For the influence oftheZoAaron Bahyaben Asher, see Gottlieb, The Kabbalah in the Writings of Bahya ben Asher, pp. 19-22,167-93. Admittedly, there is some difficulty with viewing Bahya as a disciple of the Rashba in the way that the others, such as ibn Shu'aib and ibn Gaon, are; see Gottlieb, op. cit., p. 215. In the case of ibn Gaon, the Zohar is cited extensively only in a later work, Sefer Badde ha-'Aron u-Migdal Hananel. Cf. G. Scholem, "Fragments from a Book of R. Shem Τον ibn Gaon on the Principles of the Doctrine of the Sefirot," Kiryat Sefer 8 (1931-32): 397 [in Hebrew]; J. Dan, "The Kabbalistic Book Baddei ha-Aron and Kabbalistic Pseudepigraphy in the Thirteenth Century," in Studies in Jewish Mysticism, Philosophy, and Ethical Literature presented to Isaiah Tishby, pp. 120-21 [in Hebrew], The Zohar is cited in the printed version of ibn Gaon's earlier work, Keter Shem Τον, fol. 51a (cf. Zohar 2:133b), but there is sufficient reason to doubt the authenticity of this passage as it is lacking in several manuscript versions of this work. See Scholem, "Fragments from a Book of R. Shem Τον ibn Gaon," p. 399, n. 2; Idel, "An Anonymous Commentary on the Torah from the Circle of the Rashba" (unpublished typescript in Hebrew). To be sure, other Castilian ideas are found in the material from the circle of the Rashba as well. Thus, in one of these collections, extant in MS Vat. 202, on fol. 55a, the following words appear: "I have found written by one of the wise men of our generation an explanation of 'Blessed be the name of the Glory of His kingdom forever and ever."' The reference is to a text of Moses of Burgos, published by Scholem, in Tarbiz 5 (1934): 196-97. What is particularly interesting about this example is that the explanation offered by Moses of Burgos involves the demonic realm, an idea that became standard in the Zoharic tradition. For the influence of this particular text on de Leon, see Wolfson, The Book of the Pomegranate, p. 43 (English section).</page></plain_text>
