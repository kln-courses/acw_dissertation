Artur Lundkvist, an autodidact and child of nature, is a famous Swedish writer, who has continuously introduced something new to Swedish letters. Drawing on his powerful imagination, he has used all literary genres ex- cept the dramatic in his works. His auto- biography, "Portrait of a Dreamer with Open Eyes," 1966, (see BA 41:4, p. 502) provides a background for his new book, Brottstdllen, a collection of aphorisms. It is noteworthy that aphorisms have served as excellent substitutes for scientific explana- tions in subjects to which methodological treat- ment was applied only later, such as medicine, art, and other fields of knowledge. Besides Hip- pocrates there were other medical men, such as Joannes de Meditano and Hermann Boerhaave, who communicated their medical knowledge by means of Latin aphorisms. La Rochefou- cauld too conveyed his reflections on life in his elegantly phrased aphorisms. Artur Lundkvist, whose earlier works, such as Malinga (1952) and Mbr\s\ogen (1967), already contain aphorisms, applies a new term "afolyrism," which he defines as "bildens genvag till tanken" ("a short cut to thought by image"), for the word aphorism in Brottstdllen. These "afolyrisms" are more poetry than ordi- nary aphorisms. The title "Brottstallen" itself has several connotations. "Brottstallen" means the point at which an object has become broken or divided into two pieces, or the place of frac- ture. The first part of the book consists of short "afolyrisms." Some of them are simple: "Paper knives need not be sharp"; some are simple but puzzling: "Snow makes the swan practically invisible." Some are poetically impressive: "Sea</page><page sequence="2">SWEDISH 275 stars: drifting sea asterisks," "The third dimen- sion transforms ciphers into eggs," and "A rainbow looks like a gateway to an enormous amusement park." These "afolyrisms" are like miniature arabesques, suggestive, laconic, and lyrical. Lundkvist's ingenious imagination creates fresh mental pictures, bursting with energy, visual and anthropomorphic, representing typi- cal, elementary, and essential. His colorful images are taken mostly from nature and the animal kingdom. He has an admirable in- genuity in fusing incompatible elements into an alloy of poetry, prose, and aphorisms. Some of these pithy sayings are brilliant as a pyro- technic display; some are like Swedish \ridc\e- brod, which gives the taste of the rye-freshness of reality; others are as monotonous as autumn weather in Stockholm. The second part of the book consists of longer passages, represented by a special type of "aforlyrism" - a curl of images or a chain of mental pictures linked to each other and con- tributing parallel examples. Sometimes these longer pieces grow into an autobiographical, or even a historical, sketch. Paul F. SaagpakX University of Massachusetts</page></plain_text>
