<plain_text><page sequence="1">IsMEO ACTIVITIES The archaeological excavations and restorations of IsMEO in Asia, of which a brief survey is given below, were carried out thanks to the cooperation of and a grant from the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR). The Italian Archaeological Mission to Iran has been operating of the months of September November 1969 under the direction of Dr M. Tosi, with the following staff: Mrs F. Bonardi, photographer; Mr G. Graziani, assistant; Mr G. Re goli, restorer; Dr V. Labianca, architect and drafts? man; Mr M. Piperno and Mr M. Bonelli, students. The Iranian Archaeological Service was represented by Mr A. Darbani. The researches on the earliest cultures of Sist?n have been continued this year, by enlarging excava? tions on the main Bronze Age site of the region, Shahr-i Sokhta (figs. 1-3), on an area of over 1200 square metres. The main aims this year were to explore a wider surface of the dense inhabitation area (Periods I-III), to study in all details one more building beside the ? House of Staircases ?, con? cluded in the past season (Period II-III), to increase documentation on the Late Chalcolithic layers (Pe? riod I), and to start excavations on the highest point of the mound. With the last aim we intended to uncover a main, well-preserved building, which could provide us with extensive information on the large-scale architecture. Our hypothesis turned out to be correct, as at the end of the season we had com? pletely isolated a building, extending for at least 500 square metres, with massive mud-brick walls, rising to a height of over 3 m. Three sides of the building's perimeter had unfortunately been washed off by erosion, but we were able to isolate the fourth one and the south-east corner. This large building represents a new period in the cultural sequence (Shahr-i Sokhta IV), completely undocu? mented in past campaigns. Period IV marks the introduction of the fast wheel in pottery manufac? ture; the pottery types are characterized by articu? lated shapes with straight corners, buff or brick-red in colour, rarely painted, but frequently red-slipped or burnished in parallel lines; a much smaller per? centage are of black-burnished grayware and buff jars decorated in Late Bamp?r style, carrying paint? ed and moulded elements. Period IV appears to be datable to the first quarter of the 2nd millennium and the general evidence shows, notwithstanding the sharp changes, a remarkable cultural continuity in the pottery, as well as in the metallurgical traditions. The plan of the building is a series of square and rectangular rooms, peripheral corridors, straight-sided doors with well-marked sills and two staircases, leading to an upper terrace-store, whose steps have the edges strengthened by timber frames: a technique destined to last for long in the architecture of Iran. The end of the palace was certainly a violent one as the whole of the building shows evident traces of an extensive fire: collapsed beams, wall-plasters and floors fully burnt, broken jars still in situ and a burnt human skeleton lying on the floor of the most northern, isolated room. The body fell among Period IV buff pottery, and the right hand was still holding a stone pestle. The Palace shows only a single building phase, because directly underneath the burnt floor level, the setting of the foundations cut the deposits of Period II, characterized by buff painted ware. The discovery of a fourth period of occupation, to which can be related the ? Burnt Palace ?, com? pletes the cultural sequence of Shahr-i Sokhta. It can now be divided in the following way: Pe? riod I: Late Chalcolithic, with bichrome buff and red/black on gray ware, painted with geometric designs. The general picture is very close to that of the Geoksjur Culture (Namazga III of the South Turkmenian Sequence). Among the finds, three sealings of cylindrical seals of a type apparently very close to late Uruk or Jemdet Nasr. Periods II and HI: Early and Middle Bronze Age: they show a slow but continuous development of the earlier Chalcolithic models into highly standardized pottery types. Bichrome wares disappear and the pottery classes are limited to black on buff and black on gray wares, with the exception of a polychrome pottery, usually limited to a relatively small number of specimens. Stamp-seals of a compartmented type are widely employed, and frequently occur: clay anthropomorphic and theriomorphic figurines, various types of me?al, timber and stone tools and a wonderful bronze figurine, 29 cm. high, representing a woman carrying a jar on her head, with striking Meso potamian features (figs. 4, 5). It was discovered on the surface, but is most likely to relate to these periods, which in terms of absolute chronol? ogy could mean the second half of the 3rd millennium. This period has connections with Namazga IV and Bamp?r I-IV. Period IV: Late Bronze Age. As already stated, this period sees the end of the painted tradition, the introduction of the fast wheel, new types of stamp seals and anthropomorphic figurines and, apparently, a great increase of architectural skill. On the basis of the pottery found in the destruction level (Level 4), we might associate this period with 544</page><page sequence="2">Bamp?r V-Vl and even with the Umm an-N?r Culture of the Oman peninsula. Tape R?d-i Biy?b?n. This mound lies approx? imately 25 km. south of Shahr-i Sokhta in the middle of the ancient Delta system of the Hilmand. It is covered with pottery slugs and wasters, and on the surface at least forty-two large and small pottery kilns can be recognized. In a preliminary excavation four of these were cleaned out. The pottery associated with them and covering the mound can be recognized as of Shahr-i Sokhta III and IV types. Kilns Nos. 1 and 3 have one chamber, vitrified walls, vaulted roofs and their bases are lined with a vertical row of bricks. An identical technique appears to have been employed for kilns 2 and 4 with the difference that the latter two have two fire chambers divided by a vitrified earth pillar and average 5.50 m. in length, twice as large as the other two. Excavation of this unique Bronze Age pottery mill will be resumed on a much bigger scale in the following season and will be used for pal aeomagnetic studies for the region on the basis of the wall vitrification. The Italian Archaeological Mission to Afgha? nistan began again ? from September to Nov? ember, 1969 ? its work at Tapa Sard?r, near GaznL The excavation was directed by Prof. M. Taddei, with the following staff: Mr M. Valen tini, assistant; Mr N. Labianca, draftsman; Mrs F. Bonardi, photographer; Mr E. Pagliani and Mr E. Crisanti, restorers; and Mr P. Puddinu, a student who participated in the Mission's work thanks to an agreement with the Istituto Univer sitario Orientale, Naples. Mr M. T?hir, a restorer from the Afghan Institute of Archaeology, was kindly appointed as official assistant. Not only was the area of excavation extended, but a more thorough examination of the structures found in past campaigns was carried out. Fur? thermore, some stratigraphic tests in the zone immediately adjacent to the Great St?pa (and carried down to the live rock) offered ? along with an examination of the structures ? a clarification of the chronological succession of the building techniques utilizing stone, that are in any case earlier than the brick constructions; these tests substantially modified the conclusions reached after previous campaigns (cf. EW, XVIII, 1968, pp. 109-24, 444). The succession may be schematically fixed in this way: 1) Technique with small, carefully joined slabs of schist, enclosing schist and limestone blocks smooth on the outer face; walls divided up by pilasters with moulded bases, entirely made up of small pieces of schist; the upper section of the Great St?pa and one of the minor st?pas were made using this technique. 2) Technique with small but thicker slabs of schist, not as well joined together, enclosing blocks of stone smooth on the outer face; use of rough and friable sandstone appears both in these blocks and in the shafts of the pilasters, which are squattier than the earlier ones; the lower section of the Great St?pa and various minor st?pas were made using this technique (fig. 11). This succession, confirmed by stratigraphic elements and by the relative position of the monuments, involves the singular fact that the lower section of the Great St?pa is more recent than the upper; that means a later facing that followed the replanning of the terrace on which the most ancient st?pas must have stood free and isolated. The last phase of the sacred area shows intense building activity with unbaked bricks and a flowering of clay statues and decorations, at times of colossal proportions. Documentation of this phase, already quite thorough after previous campaigns, was further enriched by the excavation of Vih?ra 23 (fig. 6) and the large square room No. 36 (fig. 9), with the remains of four large cult images. Fragments of various sizes of the drapery and heads of the latter have been preserved; two of them ? in good condition ? must be listed among the most suggestive doc? uments of Buddhist art in Afghanistan. Some decorative fragments from the same room, confirm? ing the already proposed connection between Tapa Sard?r and Central Asia (Adzina Tepe, Tumsuq), suggest resemblances to works recently found at Pjandzikent. The study of the problem of the spread of Siva cults in Afghanistan in the Sh?hi period has been enriched with an extremely important el? ement at Tapa Sard?r: in Vih?ra 23, a statue of the Buddha (of the pare type) stood opposite one of the Saiva goddess Durg? Mahis?suramardini. There remain the base, the dead body and severed head of the buffalo demon (fig. 7), along with the goddess' head (fig. 8) and various detached fragments of her arms; the head is one of the finest masterpieces ever found in Afghanistan. Apart from the beauty of the clay statuary, which must of course be taken into consideration, the Italian Mission is encouraged to continue its program of total excavation at Tapa Sard?r by the opportunity to possess a complete vision of an important cult center, especially since Tapa Sard?r also offers us the exceptional chance of being able to grasp the moments of a succession 545</page><page sequence="3">of building phases, in part superimposed, in part integrated into one another. In fact, this year a fairly extensive sounding was made below Room 36 {layer (6)), on the side of the hill; there came to light an astonishing amount of terracotta sculpture fragments (fig. 10) ? the Buddhist nature of which is still not completely ascertained ? thrown as fill over a fairly wide area. No remains of walls connected with this sculptural material have yet been found; and it is, in fact, through the extension of the soundings that we hope, in future years, to clarify the various problems offered by this exceptional production. It is possible that it covers a fairly long span of time, since, along with fragments datable to the 6th-7th cent., others can be found ? and abundantly ? whose Hellenistic ancestry is shown in stylistic traits remarkably close to the classical models. Let us note, in conclusion, that the Mission has begun fruitful surveys in the zone of Qarab?g and M?k?r. A sandstone relief from Qarab?g reminds us of Gandharan art and suggests that there was a local production along those lines, but with ? provincial ? accents. * * * In October and November, Dr Domenico Faccenna, Director of the National Museum of Oriental Art, Rome and Vice-Director of IsMEO's Centro Studi e Scavi Archeologici in Asia, visited Afghanistan and Iran, entrusted with a mission from IsMEO; together with Prof. Tucci, he examined the various problems connected with the work being carried out by the Italian Archaeological Missions in Afghanistan and Sist?n. On a proposal by IsMEO, UNESCO commis? sioned Prof. G. Zander, architect, and Dr D. Faccen? na, with the task of presenting a project for the restoration of the Palace of Ardasir I at Flr?z?b?d, and of the statue of S?p?r in the cave near Bis?p?r, in the framework of the program the Iranian Government intends to carry out for the restoration of these monuments. Surveys for the start of this project were made in the two areas in the month of October. * * * In the framework of cooperation between the Iranian Government, the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and IsMEO, the Italian Restora? tion Mission of IsMEO continued its activities in Iran. Prof. G. De Angelis d'Ossat, architect, and Prof. G. Zander, architect, collaborated in the execution of the Mission's work. Persepolis. The Mission guided by Prof. G. Tilia, with the collaboration of Dr A.B. Tilia, archaeologist, and the assistance of Mr C. D'Ami co, Mr E. Bigliazzi and Mr B. Trezza, continuing the work described in the summaries of past years (fig. 15), prepared for the perforation of the frag? ments of architraves in the east passage of the Gate of Xerxes (fig. 12). During 1970, the architrave and the crowning cyma will be raised and put back in their original position, once a supporting structure is inserted into the former. In the meantime, a detailed task calling for great patience has gone on in the Hall of the Hundred Columns: the large figure of a bull on the northwest pilaster-anta in the North Portico, which had already been given form in 1967-68 by the reuniting and resetting of its scattered fragments, is now enriched by the corner stones of the pilaster (fig. 13). Broken pieces of columns have been set together to re-form ? but only when legitimate ? the original drums; the architraves and shattered cymas of doors are being matched together and fastened at the foot of the door jambs, where it is possible to lift them back into their former position. In the Palace of Darius, the door-jambs, architraves and cymas from Qasr Ab? Nasr are arranged on the ground for a control of the matching-up of points that once held ancient dowels and clamps, a phase of control that pre? cedes raising them into place. A long period of study has borne fruit in a highly important realization: numerous stone elements of a remarkable balustrade in the south? west corner of the terrace of Taht-i Gamsid, near the so-called Palace H, have been searched for, recognized, studied and recomposed (fig. 14). The balusters, varying in height and decorated with dentils and terminal horns, were published in EW, XIX, 1969, pp. 9-43 by A.B. and G. Tilia, who discovered them. The same Italian Mission for architectural restoration working at Persepolis under the guidance of G. Tilia, also dealt with the ancient bridge-dam of Dor?dzan. A colossal new dam being built will raise the water level to a point where it will submerge the site where the Sasanid (?) dam and its cataracts stand. After an accurate survey, the structures and the rock base will be sawn, removed and transported to a safe spot, where they will be recomposed. Ispahan. Work continued on the important palaces of the Safavid era, still directed by Dr E. 546</page><page sequence="4">Galdieri, architect, with the collaboration of Dr R. Orazi, architect, Mr R. Cerbino and Mr R. Boenni, restorers, and Mr A. Miggiano, assistant. In the Palace of c?li Q?p?, the work of statical consolidation has been completed, with the tal?r excluded for the moment, and a study of the construction phases, together with the finishing touches of restoration on the open worked and painted walls on the top floor (cruciform room, fig. 16) is under way. In Cihil S?t?n the task of reinforcing the columns continues, as already described (EW, XVIII, 1968, p. 446); in the main iw?n, where the windows of the Safavid period formerly covered with bricks and plaster of the late Q?g?r period have been re-opened (fig. 19), the ancient architec? tonic values are partially returning to light. On the inside, the cleaning and consolidation of the wall-paintings, especially in the large central hall, have made great progress (fig. 18); the arched windows have been freed from their Q?g?r nar? rowing and the half-circle terminations that had altered their carinated shape, and now add their contribution to the formal unity of the building. At Hast Bihist, the work of statical consolida? tion has been finished and complementary work is being carried out now, especially the cleaning of the decorations of the muqarna-type, main cupola, and those of the walls, which are regain? ing the freshness of their original colours (fig. 17). A project for the replanning of the Mayd?n-i S?h and for the urbanistic control of its surroundings was presented by architects E. Galdieri and R. Orazi, and has been approved by the Iranian authorities. IsMEO has published this project, with Italian, French, English and Persian texts, so as to favor the spread of information regarding possible methods of defending historical sites from the dangers of new building and clumsy interventions (E. Galdieri, R. Orazi, Progetto dt sistemaztone del Mayd?n-i S?h, Roma, 1969). In order to re-enhance the monuments of Persepolis, a plant for floodlighting at night is already in operation; it has been greatly appreciated during last summer's tourist and folkloric initiatives. The project is by Dr R. Picconi, an electrotechnic engineer; he also prepared the appliances for performances of ? sound and lights ?, the text of which will be supplied by the Iranian government. Dr Picconi is now studying the illumination problems of the architectural monuments of Ispahan, and one of the bridges of that city has been added to the redevelopment 'initiatives already described (EW, cit.). Both here and in Taht-i Gamsid the work was executed by the Italian firm Sadelmi, under the supervision of Mr R. Giua. * * * On the conclusion of the archaeological campaigns, the President of IsMEO, Prof. G. Tucci, has visited India and Indonesia on a brief mission, to the purpose of contacting the Italian Embassies and the local authorities. The aim was that of establishing a programme in view of fostering cultural relations with the countries concerned. In the month of June, at the invitation of IsMEO, Prof. E. Reza, Chancellor of the National University of Tehran, has fulfilled a mission in Italy, to the purpose of contacting Italian author? ities and Government organs and for promoting closer relations between Italian and Iranian Universities. To this end, Prof. Reza has had several talks with the Undersecretary for Education as well as with University Rectors and Professors, especially of the Faculty of Architecture in the Universities of Rome and Naples. At the beginning of the month of September, the Institute has deputed Dr M. Tosi to attend a Conference at Shiraz, in the course of which the results of the activities of the foreign archaeolog? ical Missions working in Iran have been examined and illustrated. Dr Tosi has submitted a Report on the excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta. * * * Between December 1969 and January 1970, an Exhibition of modern Italian sculpture has been held in Tehran, in the premises of the new Archaeological Museum, organized by the Qua driennale d'Arte of Rome, and presented under the auspices of the National Association for cultural relations, of IsMEO, and of the Italian Cultural Institute. The collection, of which Prof. F. Bellonzi was in charge, comprised 77 sculptures, by 41 artists. The inauguration of the Exhibition was attended by the Minister for Culture and Art, who in his address has expressed the thanks and the appreciation of the Iranian Government for holding in Tehran an art show of such high artistic standard. On this occasion, Prof. M. Valsecchi, at the invitation of the Italian Embassy, has delivered at the Italian Cultural Institute a lecture on the evolution of Italian sculpture from the end of the 19th cent, down to our days; he has in addition given a lesson to the students of Architecture and 547</page><page sequence="5">Fine Arts of the University of Tehran, and held a press and television conference. The Iranian television service has dedicated three broadcasts to this cultural manifestation, which has aroused a lively interest in the radio and the press. A great number of people have visited the Exhibition. In the course of the year, IsMEO has realized several initiatives, in the frame of the celebration of Gandhi's Centenary, at the appointment of the Foreign Ministry. The celebrations have been inaugurated on May 13, by a ceremony held at the Capitol: Professor Tucci has held the official commemora? tion of the Mahatma. The Minister of Education, H. E. Ferrari Aggradi, in representation of the Italian Government, has read a message from the President of the Italian Republic, and held an introductory speech. At the initiative of the Italo-Indian Centre at IsMEO, on November 6, a lecture has been held by Dr Sushila Nayar, ex-Minister of Public Health in India, on ? Reminiscences of Gandhiji?; for the occasion, photographs illustrating the life and the works of Gandhi have been on display. The Institute has in addition opened a national competition, to the name of Gandhi, for an essay on a topic of Indological character, preferably bearing on history, literature or philosophy. The winner of the said competition, whose closing date falls due on March 31, 1970, will be awarded a prize of one million Italian Lire. In addition to the cultural manifestations connected with the Gandhi Centenary, the fol? lowing ones have taken place at IsMEO: ? February 14 and 15 - Film showing, documen? tary films: ? Modern Japanese architecture ?, ?Les estampes japonaises? (Ukiyo~e), and ?Hokkaido? (at the initiative of the Italo Japanese Centre). ? March 30 - Film showing, two documentary films on Iranian ceramics and silver ware, with an introduction by Prof. U. Scerrato, of the Istituto Universitario Orientale, Naples (at the initiative of the Italo-Iranian Associa? tion). ? April 1st - A session of the International Conference on the ? Epic poetry and its forma? tion ?, organized by the Accademia dei Lincei. On this occasion, after the welcoming address by Prof. Tucci to the participants, some reports have been submitted, by Prof. O Botto on the ? Indian epic poetry and its formation ?, by Prof. A. Zajacskowski on ? La composition et la formation historique de l'epopee indienne (Shah-N?meh de Firdowsi) ?, and by Prof. D. Marshall Lang on ?Popular and courtly el? ements in the Georgian epic ?. ? April 16 - A lecture by Prof. D. Snellgrove on ? The Religious ceremonies of the Tibetans ?, with featuring of documentary films and colour slides. ? October 31 - A lecture by Dr C. Schreiner, on ? Iran yesterday and today ? (snapshots from a trip in Iran), illustrated by a documentary film (promoted by the Italo-Iranian Cultural Association). ? December 11 - A lecture by Dr K. Fischer, on ?Historical topography of Afghanistan?, chiefly dealing with the result of the German Archaeological Survey Expedition to Afgha? nistan. Under the auspices of the Italo-Iranian Cul? tural Association, there has taken place, in the ? Persepolis ? art Gallery, an Exhibition of the works by the Iranian painters Sheherezad Marullo and Kavous Pahlevan; the paintings have remain? ed on show from July 4 to 14. * * * The Institute has awarded a scholarship to an Indian engineer, selected as one of the best students of the course of Italian language held at the Italian Cultural Centre of New Delhi, in order to enable him to follow a course of specialization on reinforced concrete construction at the Poly? technic of Milan. Financial help has also been extended to an Afghan and to an Iranian doctor, to enable them, respectively, to qualify for teaching in the branch of infectious diseases at Turin, and to follow at the University of Milan a course of specialization in pharmacology. * * * The three-year courses of Oriental languages and cultures (Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Indian and Persian) have regularly taken place. Number of attending students for the Academic Year 1968-69, 112. * * * Students at the Milan Section of IsMEO have outnumbered 200. 548</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 1 - Shahr-i Sokhta (Slst?n).
