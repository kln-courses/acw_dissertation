<plain_text><page sequence="1">K. Kailas apathy, Tamil Heroic Poetry, (Clarendon Press: Oxford University Press, 1968, XV, 282 pp.). A vast and important part of Tamil literature, the poetry of the heroic age, is dealt with clearly and accurately in this book, all aspects of its form and content being analysed. The book sets out to make known the oldest Tamil poems and give an exact interpretation of them, paying special attention to the way in which they were handed down and to the picture of life and social conditions which they reflect. To show that the conditions and situations described in these poems are typical of the so-called heroic age, the author adopts a particular method of research already proposed by other students of these forms of oral poetry. This method is a comparative one; he seizes on those aspects and features of such poetry that recur in the literature of other countries and civilisations written in the heroic tradition: for example, in Irish, German, Celtic and African literature. But the main comparison is with Homeric poetry which is the most strikingly representative of the heroic age. Finding analogies between different forms of literature far removed from each other in origin, formation and develop? ment is a daring and difficult undertaking. Yet it gives fruitful results, revealing curious and frequent affinities between the heroic ideals and ways of life peculiar to such diverse peoples. Kailasapathy's starting point is a thorough analysis of the texts: he concentrates on the collections entitled Ettutokai (The eight anthol? ogies) and Pattuppattu (The ten songs) and rejects the idea that they were the product of an academic environment. The poems are then divided up into the two basic categories of Akam (Interior) and Pur am (Exterior) according to the classic definitions. Akam is love poetry in which the reader or the listening public are unable to share in the sentiments of the protagonists; Pur am, on the other hand, is heroic poetry recounting acts of bravery and states of mind in which everyone can share. This distinction, however, is not absolute: indeed, love too, since it forms part of the life of an heroic age, can come into the Pur am category. These two types of literature have a factor in common: both form part of bardic literature which was born and developed in court circles and founded on oral tradition. In addition to this basic unity, Kailasapathy also points to a number of formal features present in Akam and Pur am poems alike: e.g. metre and uniformity in style and in narration involving a recurrent use of fixed formulas. One must assume, therefore, that the same poets were equally at home, and used the same language, in composing works in both genres. These poets, considered to be bards or minstrels owing allegiance to sovereigns or powerful lords in the courts where they practised their art, are the subject of two important chapters of this book. They are described and distinguished accord? ing to their characteristics and the duties they performed: some would sing while playing musical instruments, some were in the service of warriors urging them to combat with their verse, others would dance and sing in choral plays, and others again had the task of re-evoking the ancestors and the family vicissitudes of the lords employing them. Lastly, a number of them were simply poets proper: they were independent of the courts, often took part in divinity rites, and were deemed socially superior to the other bards. It is interesting to note that bards were accorded a respect that seems to have a distant religious origin: in fact, mutu v?y, ? ancient wisdom ?, that can be inter? preted as the art of prophecy, was a traditional attribute of poets, and their poetry was in olden times considered to be divinely inspired. All (almost certainly wandering) bards and minstrels had this in common: they only composed orally, not of course in a casual and improvising manner but according to rigorous rules and fixed patterns, remaining true to a tradition handed down from generation to generation by means of specialised instruction which was also oral. The bond between bards and their patrons was a close one. Lords, whether kings or military leaders, were their friends and honoured them 404</page><page sequence="2">having very clear obligations towards them. In return, the bards sang of their exploits, often comparing them to those of the gods: they acted as instruments of propaganda, and another of their tasks was to idealise and gloss over the sometimes brutal and violent actions of their masters for the benefit of the people. They might at times act as political messengers, as arbiters of issues and conflicts, or in some cases they administer justice. Their social position was usually secure, whether in war or peace, and they also enjoyed, perhaps, the privilege of immunity. To sum up, since they were influenced by, and derived success from the villages and courts they worked in, and in their turn honoured and influenced the latter, they were at once ? creations and creators of their age ? (p. 186). That part of the book dealing with the technique of oral versification is accurate and well furnished with examples. This technique consisted in the repetition of phrases, formulas, ideas and themes that were the same but expounded differently. Thus, poets were not worried about imitation, since originality consisted solely in the way such material was re-elaborated. In fact, the origin of whole cycles of stories, forming the core of Tamil heroic poetry, can be traced back to the way these various, and often interlinked, themes were crystallised. Besides the analysis of literary forms of the heroic age and investigation of their authors, this work contains a wealth of data about the society and environment in which such poetic practice flourished. We are given a picture of a world of warriors, an aristocratic and individualistic social structure in which the members of a strong military caste stand out. The poets were looked upon as noble just as the persons whose feats they sang of were of the nobility: a poor man or one of lowly state is hardly ever the protagonist of a love affair. The characters of these poems all possess the characteristics of the hero: desire for fame, courage, fearsome wrath, and a strong sense of friendship and honour. Another trait was a strong sense of rivalry evident in the struggle for wealth and material goods. Women, too, partake of this aristocratic distinction: they usually occupy a fairly elevated social position and within the ambit of the family are important above all as mothers and mistresses of the household. Even life in the next world is pictured in terms of heroic criteria: those who die in battle are promised a paradise all to themselves, conceived of in an anthropomorphic manner. Thus, though an explicit division of society into a caste system is not evident in the texts, there is a clear differentiation between heroes and nobles on the one hand and non-heroes and non-aristocrat ic people on the other. Of the common people, engaged in manual labour, there are few descrip? tions since they were held to be foreign to the spirit of the times. This book by Kailasapathy contains, then, a clear recostruction of the society and life of that age, accurate and thorough observation of the form, structure and content of the ancient Tamil poems, and is distinguished in particular by the compar? ative method used for such an enquiry. It can, therefore, be recommended to all those engaged in Dravidian studies, but it will also prove very useful to scholars interested in the heroic poetry of all other literatures.
