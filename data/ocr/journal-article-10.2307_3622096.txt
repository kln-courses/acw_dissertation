<plain_text><page sequence="1">A LATE MUSLIM JEWISH DISPUTATION BY MOSHE PERLMANN The British Museum has a short and apparently unique ms. account (Ms. B. M. Add. 7685 ff. 149-154) of a disputation which took place between Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi Tabataba'i, a renowned Muslim scholar, and the Jews of Du-l-Kifl, in the year 1211/1796. It is written in a small Persian hand, not without mistakes. The account takes pains to give space to the Jewish side of the controversy, almost achieving the form of a dialogue. Another feature, even more striking, is the absence of any abuse or derision. A friendly spirit in the exchange of argument is preserved throughout the discussion. The recorder is delighted because the Jews admire the Biblical knowledge displayed by the exponent of Islam; this knowledge time after time creates confusion among the Jews (tabayyaru, sakatu). The compiler of the account does not give his name. He was, in all probability, one of the Muslim disputant's numerous students present at the disputation. The Ms. is dated 1221/1805. The Sayyid addresses the Jews in a mild manner and asks them to be frank and have no fear of him (App., a). His Biblical references are quite often correct, although he fails to give the correct numbers of the chapters referred to. He is acquainted not only with the Pentateuch but also with the story of Jeroboam, the arch-misleader. He mentions, too, the Hebrew names of the three daily prayers of the Jews. Towards the end of the disputation, the Sayyid delivers a lengthy exhortation and challenges the Jews to another debate one year hence, after they have had an opportunity to consult with their best authorities. The argument is of the usual type, although some of the dialectical flourishes are not without interest. It is a very late example of this type of literature, and the disputants had at 51</page><page sequence="2">PERLMANN their command a rich store of experience, arguments, and familiarity with the writings on the subject. The first two pages describe the origin of the dispute. There were, at the time, some three thousand Jews in the locality. A group of them became involved in the disputation. We hear of David, and of the younger Ezra. Du-l-Kifl is a well-known Jewish shrine, "the tomb of Ezra." There are numerous accounts which tell of its maintenance and of the reverence in which it was held for centuries." As to Tabataba'i, he is referred to in the highest terms in various sources,2 and all these sources refer to the religious dis- putations of the "Sea of Learning" (babr-al'ulim). On the eve of his birth, his father had a vision (ru'ya) of a miraculous light, foreboding his son's greatness. We are told of the son's success in the following words: "With erudition, this excellent shaykh combined a pure soul... cultivated taste, fine character, sincere piety... He was vic- torious in his encounter with the Jews as well as in his Hijazian disputation... The account of his disputation with a group of Jewish scholars ((abbar); how he succeeded in directing those poor benighted ones ... how he persuaded them of the truth and compelled them to acknowledge the mission of our Prophet... - all these are to be found in a well-arranged book."3 Sunnites were heard to say that if there had been any truth in the Shi'ite talk of an Alid Mahdi, Tabataba'i would have been the ideal Imam. Alas, he did not enjoy a long stay on this earth but departed before reaching the age of sixty. His house I Obermeyer, Die Landschaft Babylonien, Francf. 1929, pp 321-9; Y.

He himself was an extemporaneous versifier. In particular, a "Pomegranate Poem" (al-Za,ida ar-Rummaniya) is mentioned. He excelled in every branch of learning, being like Hippocrates, Plato and Aristotle in philosophic speculation, 'Alam-al-Huda in disputation, and the Prophet in Koranic commentary. "When he interpreted the Glorious Book, you imagined that you were listening to him to whom it had been revealed." And again we read: "He prayed much in seclusion (i'tikaf) and held disputations with many of the ahl al-kitab, both with the learned and with the laymen amongst them. He pressed them all until they were converted."4 M. M. does not seem to have been a good writer, yet he en- joyed great fame and many poems were composed in his honor. His victory over the infidel is again described in a poem as a kind of miracle: the strife was severe, but the Jews were smitten at last and converted, although they were distinguished people and sound debaters.S Thus, from these sources, we learn of an Islamic triumph which the Ms. does not mention at all. It is impossible to deter- mine whether this is merely a rhetorical flourish, or whether there is any truth in it. The discussion is begun by the Jews who declare that only the Jews and the Muslims are genuine monotheists (App., b). M. M. sets about refuting the Jews: How can they lay claim to tawhid when the stories of Aaron's calf and of Jeroboam give them the lie (App., c)? If their tawbid is refuted by the story of the golden calf, the story of Jeroboam testifies to their abroga- tion of the Law (naskh) - for Solomon degraded and persecuted Jeroboam purely on suspicion, without the witnesses and the court procedure required by Mosaic law (App., d). "And he (Jeroboam) was one of Solomon's attendants. The story about him relates how Solomon discerned in him the desire for king- ship and recognized in him the signs of leadership and power. 4 Nima 125. s Nujum 318. [3] 53</page><page sequence="4">(The story of Ahijah the Shilonite, I. K. 11.29-40 is told). How could Solomon consider Jeroboam's death before Jeroboam's treason? This is not permissible under the Law of Moses, nor under any other law of a prophet, for that matter. But Solomon followed the Law of Moses. Then, if it was permissible for him although it had not been for Moses, that means abrogation was permissible." Then, he continued, are the Jews not divided amongst them- selves? Have they not three great sects and more than seventy sub-sects?6 The great Samaritan sect even has a different text of the Torah, which is primary proof that the text has been tampered with. Another proof of tahrif (textual distortion) could be drawn from the very contents of the Biblical stories. Let us take this same story of the golden calf. How could such an act be ascribed to the prophet Harun? Here a Jew retorts that Aaron was assisted by Gabriel, but Tabataba'i declares this to be sheer nonsense...7 Then take the story of Lot. Abhorrence of incest between father and daughter is common to all creeds and faiths and here we are asked to believe that Allah's prophet, a kinsman of Abraham, violated this elemental law (App., e). "The pro- hibition of intercourse between father and daughter is one of the things upon which the laws and religions are agreed. In earlier (pre-Islamic) beliefs the sister had already been forbidden (to her brother). That is why Abraham said, when the Egyptians asked him about Sarah, 'She is my sister,' so that they might not take her for his wife, and kill him on that account. Beyond doubt, the daughter deserves to be classified as prohibited even more than the sister." Nor is the story without defect when looked at from a different point of view: Lot must have been a hundred years old, and it is highly improbable that his daugh- ters could have conceived by him. And does it not follow that King David who was descended from a Moabite woman was the offspring of incest? In general there is a great deal of anthropomorphism (tajsim) and improper references in the Bible. 6 Goldziher, RHR. 26; Vorlesungen, 2. ed., p. 188. 7 L. Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, III. 122. 54 [41 PERLMANN</page><page sequence="5">A LATE MUSLIM JEWISH DISPUTATION But to return to the case for abrogation. Prayer is never mentioned in the law (in itself an indication of the unreliability of the text). A Jew states that the Torah knows of du'a and dikr, but M. M. retorts that the three daily prayers were intro- duced in the days of the Temple. Since the Temple was not built until 500 years after Moses, these prayers are not a Mosaic institution, and by their introduction the Jews abandoned the Mosaic law. In reply to the Jewish contention that the prayers had been introduced by later prophets and sages, M. M. said that this interpretation did not follow from the text, and was too far-fetched. But at this point a Jewish opponent launches a counter-attack: is Muslim prayer purely Koranic (App., f)? "0 Muslims, the Koran does not contain the details of the prayers which you offer; how do you know them notwithstanding?" The reply to this is that there is no basis for comparison; because Muslim prayer is based on the Koran in every detail. It is not only with additions to the law of Moses that the Jews can be charged. There are many laws that the Jews do not observe nowadays, e. g. the laws of ritual purity. The Jews retort that positive commands with their appropriate rewards may be altered, whereas prohibitions and the punishment con- sequent upon them may not (App., g). "This is one of the com- mands. A command may be changed to suit the times; but that is not so in the case of a prohibition. A command (fulfilled) is followed by reward, a prohibition is to ward off punishment." This interpretation, however, is rejected as unjustifiable and unwarranted because of the actual wording of the text. At this juncture the counter-attack by the Jews, who try to make use of the Koran once again, raises another question: The Koran says (5:48) "And whoso will not judge by what God hath sent down, such are the transgressors," i. e., the law of Moses should be binding on Muslims too. The Muslims retort that the Bible is recognized not by virtue of Jewish claims of its sanctity, but because of Koranic references. At the same time, the Koran itself implies the abrogation of the Mosaic law. What, then, is the difference between naskh (abrogation) and insa' (causing to forget) mentioned in the Koran? In the case [5] 55</page><page sequence="6">PERLMANN of naskh, the text of the abrogated law is preserved, whereas in the case of insa', it disappears entirely. Why, after all, do the Jews cling to their faith? Because their ancestors passed it on to them? But any sect of heathenish and ignorant people might put up the same case. It is time to abandon this type of reasoning. The matter is grave; life is fleeting. What will count in the next world is whether or not people have adhered to the right faith. The Jewish reply is that the Mosaic law is recognised by both Christians and Muslims, and that they, the Jews, prefer to retain what is uncontested leaving aside what is disputed, i. e., they cling to the incontrovertible law of Moses (App., h). Tabataba'i refuses to accept this contention, pointing out that it implies a contradiction. For if the Jews quote Christians and Muslims as evidence, they must also accept the contentions of the Christians and Muslims about the unbelief (kufr) of the Jews. Tabataba'i 'proves' that Deut. 18:18 ("a prophet from among their brethren") refers to Muhammad. The Jewish opponent is confused. "Ezra was put to shame, he changed color and 'bit his nails' in fury." Then Tabataba'i says: "You have seen my erudition in your scripture and in your beliefs, my knowledge of the teaching of your ancestors as well as of later generations." As a last resort the Jews bring forward the miracles performed by Moses. But there are also the miracles performed by Muham- mad. Moreover, these are nearer to us in time, and the reports about theni are hence more reliable (App., i-j). "How could you believe the former and reject the latter in spite of the fact that the former is remote from you and the latter near to you? It is well-known that hearing differs in force according to the re- moteness or nearness of time; the longer the stretch--the farther the sound; and the shorter the stretch, the more trustworthy the sound. Now we, Muslims, took up both; we have both proofs, and we recognized both prophets. We do not differentiate between God's apostles and their books. We do not say, like you, that we believe in one and reject the other. Praise be to God who guided us to this." 56 [6]</page><page sequence="7">[7] A LATE MUSLIM JEWISH DISPUTATION 57 Suppose Abraham were to appear before the Jews and ask them why they had forsaken his creed and law for the law of Moses; what could they possibly reply? That the later prophet had assumed the place of the earlier one? Well, the same holds good with respect to Mubammad and Moses (App., k). Tabataba'i asks the leader of the Jews: "Have you given thought to the pursuit of truth and knowledge?" To which the Jew replies that he has been accustomed to believing in the Law, but that the matter must be investigated. The Jews will consult some other authorities, and the debate may be resumed at some future date.8 In this way the disputation comes to a close. It would be of interest to know whether there is any other source which might throw light on this event, and on the fate of the Jews in Du-l-Kifl. APPENDIX J _ ,.. J JSr : 1 O.. yV ^43 J6.j a. ?..,.
