<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lacking All Interest: Levinas, Leibowitz, and the Pure Practice of Religion* Michael Fagenblat Monash University, Australia To bear witness to God is precisely not to state this extraordinary word. -Emmanuel Levinas Despite its initial association with an intellectual milieu that is for the most part antireligious, the thought of Emmanuel Levinas (1905-1995) has increasingly made its way into the heart of contemporary theological literature. By comparison, the work of the Israeli religious and political critic Yeshayahu Leibowitz (1903-1994) is hardly known outside his home country. In Israel, however, Leibowitz was an unrivaled intellectual presence whose severe, unconventional religious and politi- cal views were constantly heard in both public and academic debate. While they never engaged in a robust intellectual exchange, Levinas and Leibowitz did cor- respond briefly and were certainly aware, and indeed admiring, of each other's work. This mutual admiration is surprising and significant. For if Levinas is known for a thorough blending, even an identification of religious and ethical philosophy, Leibowitz ought to be known for the no less thorough antithesis he posits between the religious and the ethical. Avi Sagi has even suggested that Leibowitz is more radical than Kierkegaard on this point, for the latter argued that religious faith is *Thanks to Joelle Hansel and the other organizers of the conference "Levinas in Jerusalem," held in July 2001, for the first chance to air these thoughts, and to the Jerusalem Fellows program of the Mandel School for Social and Education Leadership, which enabled me to write this paper.

If so, any comparison of Leibowitz and Levinas would presumably entail distinguishing one thinker from the other.2 My claim in this paper, by contrast, will be that the apparent antithesis be- tween Levinas and Leibowitz gives way to a broad convergence in most of their thought. Perceiving the profound similarities between Levinas and Leibowitz should enable us to understand exactly where and how they differ. This surprising convergence leads to a Jewish vindication of religion whose philosophical (gen- eral, nonparticularistic) genealogy nevertheless confirms its historical distinction through unconditional praxes. This genealogy, like that of so many modem Jewish philosophers, is Kantian to the core, primarily because of the emphasis given to the deontic and the subordination of theology to action. As we shall see, however, both disagree with Kant by understanding obligation as heteronomous, even as each of them makes the Kantian move of deriving freedom from the obligation. Leibowitz and Levinas propose a theocentric account of religious life that accepts a modem, philosophical critique of religious language and metaphysics while extolling the actuality of religious transcendance approached through practice. It is a philosophy of religious transcendance mediated by the concreteness of the given commandment. The claim that Levinas's and Leibowitz's philosophy of religion converge on most decisive matters also implies an effectively different reading of Levinas than is usually promoted. In the final section of this paper, having argued that Levinas and Leibowitz are fundamentally offering a convergent philosophy of practical obligation, I turn to the implications of this argument for our interpreta- tion of Levinas's thought in general. Reading Levinas otherwise requires us to renegotiate two fundamental orientations of his thought and thereby reopen two central questions. First, if the comparison between Levinas and Leibowitz holds good, then the very meaning of what Levinas calls "ethics" must be opened and addressed anew. What does "ethics" mean if it cannot be adequately distinguished from Leibowitz's decidedly anti-ethical account of the Jewish religion? Second, our investigation drives the question of the relation between religious and ethical obligations beyond the ultimately ambiguous notion of "the other." We will then have to ask the following: Where does a philosophy of transcendence fall if not on the other? This question points toward a conclusion.

It is not their antithetical accounts of the relation between religion and ethics, nor law and ethics, that divides Levinas and Leibowitz, but the extent to which each one's thought can be applied. Leibowitz's account holds more tightly, so to speak, but carries less. Levinas's position is subject to more ambiguity in its determining concept, but this ambiguity permits a broader range of application to human experience as such and tells us a great deal about what it means to be a person given over to obligations at large. * An Unforeseen Encounter On first consideration, it seems understandable that, despite a handful of passing remarks, Levinas and Leibowitz never engaged each other's work, and likewise that the great standing each enjoyed in his respective community nevertheless only recently led commentators to compare their thought.3 Indeed, on the face of it there seems an obvious and formidable obstacle to any dialogue that might be staged between these two great modern Jewish thinkers. While Levinas maintained that between religion and ethics there is not only interdependence but even identity, Lei- bowitz insisted on the no less extreme claim that religion and ethics are antithetical and irreconcilable with one another. An initial and straightforward reading of each thus seems naturally to lead to the view that they are fundamentally incompatible thinkers, as commentators have indeed concluded. Leibowitz's classic 1953 essay, "Religious Praxis: The Meaning of Halakhah," expresses his view of the incompat- ibility between Judaism and ethics in his typically caustic manner: Ethics, when regarded as unconditionally asserting its own validity, is an atheistic category par excellence. . . . The Torah does not recognize moral imperatives stemming from knowledge of natural reality or from awareness of man's duty to his fellow man. All it recognizes are Mitzvoth, divine im- peratives .... Halakhah [that is, Jewish law and legal practice] as a religious institution cannot admit the category of the ethical.4 And again: From the standpoint of Judaism man as such has no intrinsic value. He is an "image of God," and only as such does he possess special significance. That 3See previous note. As Banon says, the passing remarks that Levinas made about Leibowitz can be found in Emmanuel Levinas, Difficult Freedom: Essays on Judaism (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990) 219; and especially in idem, Entre Nous: Thinking of the Other (New York: Columbia University Press, 1988) 206.

The Bible does not recognize the good and the right as such, only "the good and the right in the eyes of God" (Deut. 12:28).5 Just four years later, in Levinas's important essay, "A Religion for Adults," we find the exact opposite view expressed: "everything I know of God and everything I can hear of His word and reasonably say to Him must find an ethical expression"; and later: "Ethics is not simply the corollary of the religious but is, of itself, the element in which religious transcendence receives its original meaning."6 This view of the dependence of religion on ethics, indeed of the reduction of religion to ethics, is elaborated in Levinas's great and beautiful work, Totality and Infinity: The dimension of the divine opens forth from the human face. ... There can be no "knowledge" of God separated from the relationship with men. The Other is the very locus of metaphysical truth, and is indispensable for my relation with God. ... The Other is not the incarnation of God, but precisely by his face, in which he is disincarnate, is the manifestation of the height in which God is revealed. It is our relations with men . .. that give to theological concepts the sole significance they admit of.7 Nothing could be starker than the contrast this makes with Leibowitz's claim that "Halakhah as a religious institution cannot admit the category of the ethical." There are of course many further examples of the ostensible antithesis between Leibowitz and Levinas, the former arguing for the amoralism of Jewish faith and the latter arguing that religion, and especially the Jewish religion, is ethics.8 I shall not enlist further citations to support the idea that when it comes to the relation between religion and ethics, Leibowitz and Levinas hold opposing views, for I take it for granted that this view will make sense, if not seem obvious, to anyone who has read some of their work. Let us now turn, however, to what is interesting about this comparison between Levinas and Leibowitz: namely, the extensive similarity and indeed the profound convergence in their thought. 5Ibid., 6-7. 6Respectively, Levinas, Difficult Freedom, 17; and Emmanuel Levinas, Beyond the Verse: Talmudic Readings and Lectures (London: Athlone, 1994) 107. 7Emmanuel Levinas, Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969) 78-79.

Both thinkers are at pains to argue for the nonconceptual, nonrepresentable, and nonexperienceable exaltedness of God. For each one, God is stationed beyond the empirical or phenomenological world. This commitment to transcendence derives from their joint affirmation that the modem world, the world we live in, has become intelligible or explainable without reference to God's plan, intervention, or causal power.9 Whether one speaks in terms of empiricism or phenomenology, positivism or constructivism, the idea of God has become unnecessary for explaining the world and human experience. This idea that God is not necessary for explaining the world is in no way a denial of God; but it is an admission that our descriptions and explanations of what happens in the world do not depend on metaphysical or theistic assumptions. It follows that atheism and secularism are entirely legitimate and sufficient ways of accounting for the world. Levinas and Leibowitz begin with a religious commitment that not only denies proof for the existence of God but in fact respects the atheistic denial of positive theology. As Levinas says, "faith purged of myth, the monotheist faith, itself implies metaphysical atheism.""' This is because Levinas, to this extent a religious philosopher in the tradition of Moses Maimonides, stakes his faith on the idea of God being categorically different from all ideas pertaining to the world. In this light human experience appears for all intents and purposes to fall on the side of atheism--but this is the only way, somewhat paradoxically, to testify to the true idea of God: "Atheism conditions a veritable relationship with a God KaOa' ar'6.""' The true idea of God, according to Levinas, depends on our atheistic condition as human beings categorically separated from God: One can call atheism this separation so complete that the separated being main- tains itself in existence all by itself, without participating in the Being from which it is separated-eventually capable of adhering to it by belief. ... One lives outside God, at home with oneself.... The soul,.... being an accomplish- ment of separation, is naturally atheist. ... It is certainly a great glory for the creator to have set up a being capable of atheism, a being which, without having been causa sui, has an independent view and word [sic, for "world"] and is at home with itself.'2 Self and world are separate phenomena that make sense in their own terms, without reference to God, and so there is no need to resort to the idea of God. 9Levinas, Totality and Infinity, 58-59; idem, Difficult Freedom, 100; idem, Beyond the Verse, 106-7; and Leibowitz, Judaism, 57, 75, 132-41.

"Ibid. 12Ibid., 58-59.</page><page sequence="6">6 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW But this atheistic independence is precisely what allows us to relate to the proper transcendence of God, to practice a "religion for adults" that needs and seeks nothing of God.13 Leibowitz holds what amounts to the same view: "Man's consciousness of standing before God has nothing to do with his knowledge of the world, which is understood scientifically."'4 For Levinas and Leibowitz the idea of God is entirely separate from all that we know and could know of the world, and therefore atheism is the proper religious attitude to worldly events and causal explanations. Of course, this affirmation of an atheistic epistemology in no way mitigates Leibowitz's or Levinas's commitment to religious life, and in truth both Levinas and Leibowitz privilege the idea of God as a way of giving normative significance to human experience. But the normative register is distinct from that of knowledge and consequently goes hand in hand with an experience of atheism and an atheistic epistemology, for one can have no knowledge of God outside normative life. In- deed, this experience of atheism even makes way for their religious faith, that is, for their practical commitment to God. Let us confirm the point, however, by taking their united rejection of theodicy as an example of how both Levinas and Leibowitz dissociate all explanations of worldly events from their understanding of religion. Both of these defenders of religion categorically refuse to ascribe theological significance to personal suf- fering or historical events (including the two "epoch-making" events in modern Jewish history, the Holocaust and the establishment of the state of Israel). For both Levinas and Leibowitz, no "will of God" hides behind the events that befall the world, including those that affect us most severely. As Levinas says, suffering is "useless," meaning that it performs no function in making sense of what happens. He thinks that the conceptual horizons of modernity and the unspeakable horrors of modem history, such as the Holocaust, render even the "shadow of a consoling theodicy" impossible and indeed reprehensible."' "It renders impossible and odious every proposal and every thought that would explain it by the sins of those who have suffered or who are dead."'6 Levinas views history and suffering as essentially irreconcilable with a theology of God's immanence and efficacy in the world. This view is but one expression of his repudiation of all attempts to wed theology with 13"Monotheism surpasses and incorporates atheism, but it is impossible unless you attain the age of doubt, solitude and revolt" (Levinas, Difficult Freedom, 16).

On the contrary, the Holocaust is perhaps the single most significant event that led him to reject and reverse the classical privilege that philosophy accords to epistemology and ontology over ethics. It is from the Holocaust that Levinas derives his somewhat diabolical view of the nature of being and the will to know, and it is in relation to the Holocaust that he formulates his nonreductionist account of human subjectivity and its desire for the good. It is precisely on account of the near-pervasive consequence that Levinas sees in the evils, injustices, and suffer- ings of history, exemplified by the Holocaust, that he renounces every correlation between actual, historical events and the order of God's holiness. No longer can faith abide the idea of God's presence in history, at least not phenomenal history; today it remains to live with the idea of "Holy History," "in a faith more difficult than before, in a faith without theodicy."'1 Leibowitz likewise rejects every hint of theodicy, but not only for the moral reason that holds suffering to be theologically "non-integratable."''9 It is not suffer- ing per se that Leibowitz wishes to dissociate from God but all events that are not intentionally directed toward the service or sanctification of God. For Leibowitz, nothing save the intention of the person who undergoes the event turns it into one of religious significance. This means that there is no external, observable criterion for determining the religious import of what befalls a person, much less 7Levinas's view is perhaps more complicated. Like Leibowitz, Levinas admits that a person can make religious meaning out of his or her own lived experience (Emmanuel Levinas, In the Time of the Nations [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994] 187 n. 6). Thanks to Shaul Wacchstock for reminding me of this exception. More commonly, Levinas argued that suffering cannot be justified or redeemed, but that one can make meaning of it by letting it inspire compas- sion or love (Entre Nous, 100). "Levinas, Entre Nous, 100. Interestingly, on one of the two occasions that Levinas mentions Leibowitz, he contrasts his own view to that of his Israeli counterpart on the basis of the notion that after the Holocaust it has become necessary, even if it was once undesirable, to give "political conditions" to the ideas of Holy History (Entre Nous, 206). Such desultory remarks concerning politics, however, should not be taken to express a systematic translation of Levinas's meditations on the holy and the good into the political arena. That issue is more complicated and needs to be considered in light of the severe distinction Levinas more commonly makes between ethics and politics. No doubt biographical considerations also contributed to such a remark, plus a thoroughly unobvious interpretation of Leibowitz, who is in fact vehemently opposed to "supernatural" for- mulations of Jewish life and plainly denies that "the Messiah must be taken literally" (ibid.), as Levinas seems to think. 9This is Levinas's term: "Suffering, as suffering, is but a concrete and quasi-sensible manifestation of the non-integratable, or the unjustifiable. The 'quality' of evil is this non-integratableness" (Em- manuel Levinas, Of God Who Comes to the Mind [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998] 128).</page><page sequence="8">8 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW an objective or even defensible rationale of how a particular event accords with God's will: I have no reliable source of knowledge of the divine intentions and do not detect in the occurrences of the lower world any religious significance, unless they incorporate an intention in the lower world aimed at the upper world; in other words--insofar as human beings act for the sake of Heaven. Apart from this, history has no religious meaning.20 On this reckoning, theodicy, which seeks to defend God against the charge that what happens in the world is unjust or evil, is a premodern (pre-Kantian) confla- tion of categories that attempts to give religious meaning to empirical occurrences. Instead, Leibowitz leaves worldly occurrences to science and reserves religion for intentional and prescriptive life, both of which, he claims, remain beyond the bounds of scientific explanation. It is, according to Leibowitz, a categorical mistake to view religious life with a scientific gaze, for religion is essentially concerned with intentional states and normative conduct, about which science has nothing to say.21 Both philosophers, then, agree that there is no point in invoking God to explain the suffering that results from natural and historical events.22 Theodicy is in effect bad science (for Leibowitz) or bad phenomenology (for Levinas). The suffering that takes place in the natural and historical world cannot contribute at all to anything one might say about God's relation to this world. The correlate to this severing of theology from epistemology is a view of God as radically transcendent, outside our horizons of knowledge as they apply to science, history, psychology and all other objective (or "intersubjective") fields of knowledge. God as absolutely transcendent is the positive reformulation of the idea that we learn nothing of God's ways by interpreting what happens in the world.23 On this basis, we might say that both Levinas and Leibowitz divide meaning into two grand categories: the profane and the holy, or the "Same" and the "Other," corresponding to the classical distinction between fact and value. They both affirm modernity's reduction of ideas and essences to immanent forces, such as nature, history or being, while contending that the idea of God is incommensurable with these registers. Accordingly they share a strong commitment to a certain ahistori- cism, since the idea of God bears its full significance regardless of what happens in the natural and historical world. And since God is entirely separated from 2"Leibowitz, Judaism, 219; compare 102. 21Ibid., 132-41. 22See also Yeshayahu Leibowitz, Faith, History, and Values (in Hebrew) (Acadamon: Jerusalem, 1981) 140-55, 165-69. 23Levinas, Totality and Infinity, 52; idem, Entre Nous, 91-101; Emmanuel Levinas, Collected Philosophical Papers (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1987) 100-1; Leibowitz, Judaism, 96-105, 214-20.</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL FAGENBLAT 9 epistemology, the force of God's significance is wholly normative or prescriptive, that is, practical. The distinction between the profane and the holy allows Levinas and Leibowitz to affirm the autonomy, validity, and relevance of naturalistic or phenomenological explanations while that distinction at the same time provides an external, evaluative perspective. In fact, each one takes this logic to the negative extreme, concluding that of the Holy Blessed One whom they serve all naturalistic, immanent, or phenomenological claims must be denied, to the point that it need not even be said that God is the Creator (according to Leibowitz) or that God exists (according to Levinas), at least not in the functional way we ordinarily make sense of these theological predicates.24 This otherness or irreducibility of the holy leads them both to assign it a unique significance which, since it is of a different order than that of facts, phenomena, and all objects of knowledge, carries a radically "negative" theological charge that is felt only in the practice of law and obligation.25 1 Religion within the Limits of Practice Alone This aversion for theology, though it undoubtedly reflects a response to a religious crisis precipitated by modernity, at the same time offers Leibowitz and Levinas a way of purifying religious practice. Separating God from the explanatory order makes holiness a noninstrumental and in that sense unconditioned value, unlike all other values that can be reduced to one function or another. This religious intuition sees theology as such as pandering to anthropocentric impulses. By holding fast to a God radically outside the categories of human understanding, Leibowitz and 24For Leibowitz's daring idea that true faith is independent of the claim that God is Creator, see Faith, 51, 54-55. This claim goes back to Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed (trans. Shlomo Pines; 2 vols.; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963) pt. 1, ch. 52; pt. 2, chs. 24-25. Levinas's notion that God might be "beyond being" is suggested, for example, in his Otherwise than Being, or, Beyond Essence (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1994) xlii. This position likewise finds precedent in Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed, pt. 1, chs. 52, 56-57. The argument has been extended by Jean-Luc Marion, God without Being (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991). 25As Levinas said in his final lecture at the Sorbonne, in 1975-1976: "near, yet different-which is, moreover, the very meaning of the word 'holy.'... God is not simply the first other but other than other [autre qu'autrui], other otherwise, other with an alterity prior to the alterity of the other person, prior to the ethical compulsion to the neighbor. In this way God is different to every neighbor. And transcendent to the point of absence" (God, Death, and Time, 223-24). Leibowitz makes a similar claim: "Originally, and in its authentic sense, 'holy' refers to God. Hence it is not amenable to explication in terms derived from ordinary discourse, and it cannot be applied to anything that exists as part of the world. In human reality the category cannot be applied except as indicating an activity which is directed toward 'the Holy' and connoting the service of God, the performance of the Mitzvoth. It signifies both the goal toward which we must strive, and the striving itself. But it does not denote any existing entity. Within the confines of human reality that is only functional holiness. Essential holiness pertains to God alone. Whoever applies the notion of holiness to a natural or artificial being--to man, land, an institution, a building, or an object--is engaging in idolatry" (Judaism, 46).</page><page sequence="10">10 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Levinas seek to break anthropocentric projections and fantasies so as to enable genuine appreciation and service of God. Interestingly, this commitment to transcendence accommodates the vehement rejection of metaphysics by nearly all modern thought, which can perhaps be characterized by nothing as much as by its commitment to reductionism. From positivism to contructivism, from empiricism to the linguistic turn, from structur- alism to materialism, the one common feature of modern thought is its rejection of transcendence. Levinas and Leibowitz at once accept such reductionism with respect to epistemology and therefore theology, but posit religious practice as a means of elevating human action and thus avoiding a pervasive reductionism that would crush human agency and value. For them, therefore, our lack of knowledge of God is a positive if somewhat perilous event for religion, since religious practice must now rise to a purer level of service where it gives itself wholly to God without asking for anything in return, not even the consolations of knowledge. The atheistic outlook is thus not only a crisis for traditional religious dependencies but also a way of purifying religious practice in the modern world. Another way of seeing how this rejection of theology becomes a commitment to religious practice is by considering the critique Leibowitz and Levinas make of idolatry. "Anyone who denies idolatry is called a Jew," says the Talmud.26 Both Levinas and Leibowitz cash out this apothegm by arguing that Jewish religious life stakes itself on the insufficiency of our finite capacities to speak about God or even to relate to God in any way besides practical obligation. Nature and being; our religious and our everyday language; cognition, intuition, and description: all these fall on the side of idolatry when they profess to relate to God, though they may do well for relating to the experience of self and world. As Levinas puts it, idolatry is the "supreme criterion" that institutes a radical disjuncture into spiritual life: "idolatry or religion.""27 For Leibowitz, the disjuncture is no less radical: "Faith in the 'holy God' ought to prevent man from ascribing intrinsic holiness to anything in the world."28 Epistemological atheism thus has theocentricism as its correlate, while idolatry is expanded to include any self-satisfying reduction of service of God to service of oneself or one's worldly needs. It seems to me that this position combines the two classical and usually con- trasted Jewish views of idolatry, those of Moses Maimonides and Judah Halevi. Though in the case of Levinas I do not want to claim a conscious influence, he and Leibowitz agree with Maimonides that all representation of God is inadequate and even idolatrous and that one can only avoid such idolatry by negating theological 26b. Meg. 13a. 27Levinas, In the Time, 58. 28Leibowitz, Judaism, 121.</page><page sequence="11">MICHAEL FAGENBLAT 11 language.29 But they also agree with Halevi in holding that idolatry can only be overcome by responding to God according to the revealed practical way.30 Thus, the two classical medieval views on idolatry are merged by Levinas and Leibowitz, who argue that acquaintance with total otherness (Maimonides' alternative to idolatry) can only be had by heteronomous action (Halevi's alternative to idolatry).31 This critique of idolatry transforms theology into a negative discourse for Levinas and Leibowitz, just as it was for Maimonides before them, and even goes so far as to negate theological cognition altogether by making practice the only legitimate product and final arbiter of faith. Practice is the only way of responding to tran- scendence without burdening religion with excessive epistemological commitment. God becomes incomprehensible, unexperienceable, infinite, perfect, transcendent, beyond, wholly other--in a word, holy; but these negations result neither in the "intellectual apprehension" nor the "silent contemplation" promoted by the Guide of the Perplexed but in a pure practice of religion. Rather than this unusual combination of Maimonides' theory of negative attri- butes with Halevi's insistence on heteronomous practice of revealed law, however, it is perhaps more likely Immanuel Kant's critical and practical philosophy that stands behind this modern view of Jewish religious life. That would not be surprising, since both Leibowitz and Levinas are manifestly indebted to Kant's eschewal of speculative theology and, in particular, to his referral of questions that lie beyond the 29Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed, pt. 1, chs. 50-60. In particular, Maimonides cites a similar tannaitic adage to the one just cited--"he who disbelieves in idolatry, professes the Torah in its entirety"-at the end of the Guide, pt. 3, ch. 29 (see translator's references ad loc.); and again in Mishnah Torah (Laws of Idolatry 2.4). These passages are discussed by David Hartman, Israelis and the Jewish Tradition (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000).

Hartwig Hirschfeld; Schocken: New York 1964) ? 1.97. 31In other words, they both reject the view, often ascribed to Maimonides, that silent contempla- tion is the only proper way of doing theology, just as they reject Halevi's view that affirms worship in the midst of flagrant anthropomorphism. Levinas seems to add speech to action as a proper mode of contact with the other, though it is not certain that "the saying" of Otherwise than Being and the "discourse" of Totality and Infinity do, in fact, admit to any expression beside practical action.

Moreover, in an important essay on Maimonides, the acclaimed late Israeli scholar, Shlomo Pines, argued that the author of the Guide was himself committed to a proto-Kantian position, and Leibowitz's reading of Maimonides confirms that interpretative possibility.32 Pines suggests that the best way of making sense of the recourse that Maimonides's negative theology makes to contemplation is, in the final analysis, by seeing cognition as defining the limits of human knowledge of God and by affirming practice as the only way beyond the cognitive impasse.33 Instead of accessing divine truth, the contemplative work of the negative theologian performs a critique of theological reasoning avant la lettre, a critique that ends with an entirely practical theology without any knowledge of God. In any case, whether it is a proto-Kantian Maimonides or Kant himself that presages the turn from theology to practice, we shall best clarify Levinas's and Leibowitz's position by examining the Kantian legacy directly.34 * Heteronomous Freedom To see how Levinas and Leibowitz make the Kantian gesture of moving from a philosophical rejection of theology to an affirmation of practical religion, we might consider the crucial role each assigns to human freedom, as indeed Kant did before them. Examining the idea of freedom in both their works should further support my contention that there is much more in common between Levinas and Leibowitz than first meets the eye. Initially, the question of freedom seems to reflect a disagreement between them, since Leibowitz views religious life as the realization of human freedom and autonomy while Levinas seems to advocate a heteronomous response to the other. Yet this apparent discrepancy is readily resolved when it is seen that 32Leibowitz, Faith of Maimonides, 88-92, 101-7. 33Significantly, Pines suggests that Maimonides has political practice and political leadership in mind (following Guide of the Perplexed, pt. 1, ch. 54), whereas Leibowitz is adamant that only religious practice can pass beyond the limits of human knowledge of God; see Shlomo Pines, "The Limitations of Human Knowledge according to Al-Farabi, Ibn Bajja, and Maimonides," in The Collected Works of Shlomo Pines, Volume V: Studies in the History of Jewish Thought (ed. Warren Zev Harvey and Moshe Idel; Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1997) 98-100. 34This has been done in different ways by Yohanan Siliman, "Kantian Motives in Leibowitz's Philosophy" (in Hebrew); and by Naomi Kasher, "Leibowitz's Conception of Religion Compared to Kant's Concept of Morality" (in Hebrew), both in The Yeshayahu Leibowitz Book (ed.

As he says: Willing acceptance of a way of life which does not derive from human nature implies the emancipation of man from the bondage of raw nature. . . . Man activated by his "own" nature is, in effect, nothing but a robot activated by the forces of nature, just like the cattle grazing in the pasture, which are also "free from the Torah and the Mitzvoth"; that is, from any law externally im- posed. ... The only way man can break the bonds of nature is by cleaving to God; by acting in compliance with the divine will rather than in accordance with the human will. The latter is a natural factor. . . . The true meaning of the Tannaitic adage "None but he who busies himself with the Torah is free" is that he is free from the bondage of nature because he lives a life which is contrary to nature.35 Leibowitz's notion of freedom is thus the ability or the decision to accept the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, to accept an externally imposed law; it is the heteronomy of religious law that makes Leibowitzian freedom possible. This is equally the case for Levinas, for when he extols the heteronomous character of the relation with the other, the last thing he is doing is making deterministic claims about human relation- ships. On the contrary, he is claiming that only responsibility to an externally obeyed commandment enables genuine moral action. Like Kant and Leibowitz, for Levinas the primacy of the fact of obligation is what enables a human being to transcend the immanent forces of being and thus act responsibly. Levinas's responsibility, like Kant's duty and Leibowitz's decision to accept the "yoke of the law," is thus a way of realizing a certain freedom with respect to the immanent forces that act on human agency. But unlike Kant, Levinas sees religious practice as a way of realizing freedom, and in this he comes to the same position as Leibowitz: the most characteristic aspect of Jewish difficult freedom lies perhaps in the ritual that governs all the acts of daily life, in the famous "yoke of the Law." In ritual, nothing is numinous. There is no idolatry. In ritual a distance is taken up within nature in respect of nature, and perhaps therefore it is the waiting for the Most-High which is a relation to Him.36 We can therefore understand why it is that Levinas places a gloss of the very same Tannaitic adage cited by Leibowitz - "freedom on tablets of stone"- as the epigraph to his first collection of essays on Judaism.37 The title of that collection, Difficult 35Leibowitz, Judaism, 21-22; compare idem, Faith of Maimonides, 84-92, 96. 36Levinas, Beyond the Verse, 143. 37After quoting Exod 32:16, which mentions the writing "carved on tablets," the Mishnah ('Aboth 6.2) says: "'Carved on tablets'--do not read 'carved' (nn'n) but 'freedom' (nn), for</page><page sequence="14">14 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Freedom, is emblematic of the fact that Levinas's language of heteronomy is in the final analysis a commitment to human freedom. As was the point for Leibowitz, it is the externality of the law that alone enables the subject to defy the natural, or in Levinas's case, the ontological order. As he puts it in Otherwise than Being, or, Beyond Essence, "Substitution frees the subject from ennui, that is, from the en- chainment to itself."38 And in the essay "Ethics as First Philosophy," Levinas makes the uncharacteristic but telling point of emphasizing that subjectivity trades on an "immemorial freedom" that is the condition for the ethical break from the natural or ontological order of self-interest.39 That Levinas sees this freedom as a religious possibility as much as an ethical one is likewise evident from his characterization of revelation as an "inversion" or "reversal" that interrupts the ontological interests of the world. "To obey the Most-High is to be free."" All this seems to me sufficient to establish that Leibowitzian autonomy and Levinasian heteronomy are in point of fact aiming at the same idea, and that this idea derives from Kant. Levinas's notion of heteronomous responsibility and Lei- bowitz's notion of autonomous halakhic praxis repeat the strategy Kant employed in the face of the theoretical antinomy of freedom.41 Call it "ethics" or "religious praxis," the point is that deontological action-action based on what one ought to do, on one's duty rather than any benefit one might accrue, whether directly or indirectly--is the only way of realizing human freedom, as was the case for Kant. Behind the apparent difference between Levinasian heteronomy and Leibowitzian autonomy is a consensus about the liberating effect ofacts ofobligation. As Levinas says in the same central chapter of Otherwise than Being, "the self liberates itself none but he who busies himself with the Torah is free." Levinas's epigraph, "freedom on tablets of stone," is in fact a paraphrase and not a quotation of the Mishnah. Note also that in Otherwise than Being, Levinas redeploys the same image from Mishnah 'Aboth: the "reverting of heteronomy into autonomy. ... The metaphor of the inscription of the law in consciousness expresses this in a remarkable way" (148). 38Levinas, Otherwise than Being, 124. This citation comes from the final section of the central chap- ter of Otherwise than Being, titled "Finite Freedom." In Totality and Infinity, the relation with the other is likewise the sole way of freeing oneself from oneself and the uncertain realm of il y a existence. 39Emmanuel Levinas, "Ethics as First Philosophy," in The Levinas Reader (ed. Sean Hand; Basil Blackwell: Oxford, 1989) 84. 40Levinas, Beyond the Verse, 142. Or again: "it is precisely within this relation [of revelation] that man becomes his 'self': designated without any possibility of escape, chosen, unique, non- interchangeable and, in this sense, free" (ibid., 148). To this remark Levinas adds the following note. "Freedom would therefore mean the hearing of a vocation to which I alone am capable of responding; or even the capability-to-respond right there, where I am called" (ibid., 214 n. 6).

The paradox stems from Levinas's and Leibowitz's rejection of the Kantian idea that reason is unconditionally given to human experience. For Kant, it is the primacy and unconditionality of reason that allows for the construc- tion of the moral law and the practice of human freedom. Only because the fact of reason is not conditioned on any other fact does it become possible to say that a human will formed in accordance with reason is likewise unconditioned and thus free. Following Heidegger, however, Levinas rejects this view of reason as uncon- ditioned and sees the fact of reason as contingent on the more fundamental horizon of being-in-the-world, which is a prerational, entirely practical mode of existing. Leibowitz also denies that reason is unconditional because he conceives of human psychology in behavioristic terms that see rationality as a function of instinct. By denying the unconditioned primacy of Kant's "fact of reason," they both, then, view rational morality as a set of conditioned imperatives founded on more basic ontological or empirical foundations. Conceiving reason as a fact conditioned on history or biology leads Levinas and Leibowitz to view rational imperatives as hypothetical imperatives. On this view, aligning one's will with the pure form of reason fails to realize freedom precisely because it results in action contingent on the biological or historical conditions that give rise to reason. Far from leaving Kant behind, however, it is here that the paradoxical repetition takes effect, for the Kantian ambition to realize human freedom through deonto- logical practice turns Levinas and Leibowitz from the primacy of reason to the primacy of obligation itself. They are united in seeking an account of uncondi- tioned or categorical obligation in the wake of a reduction of reason to more basic conditions. They agree that only an unconditioned obligation can allow freedom and responsibility to be realized, and they agree that such an obligation cannot be found in purely rational morality. But if the rational ground of categorical action has fallen into the metaphysical past, how can obligation be in any way unconditioned or categorical? How can the reduction of obligation to amoral interests, such as culture, nature, or history, 42Otherwise than Being, 115; compare Tamra Wright's reading of this passage in Twilight of Jewish Philosophy (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999) 51-52. 43Levinas, Beyond the Verse, 142; idem, Otherwise than Being, 121-29; Yeshayahu Leibowitz, Judaism, The Jewish People, and the State of Israel (in Hebrew) (Tel Aviv: Schocken, 1976) 60; idem, Judaism, 21-24; and idem, Faith of Maimonides, 80-92.

According to Jean-Franqois Lyotard, something like the questions I have just formulated frame Levinas's entire agenda.4 That is to say, Levinas is striving to formulate an unconditional sense of obligation within the climate of reductionism that characterizes modem philosophy. His ingenious response to this challenge is to break with philosophy's traditional subordination of obligations to "value-neutral" registers, such as ontology or epistemology. After all, even Kant subordinates the moral law to the fact of reason, even as the value of a human be- ing as an end-in-itself is contingent on its rationality. "Rational nature exists as an end in itself," says Kant, but human nature is therefore valued as an end only qua rational nature.45 The great innovation of Levinas's approach is in seeing obligation as not dependent on any prior (ontological or epistemological) conditions. On the contrary, ethics-the obligatory relations that bind us to each other-is the very condition and ground for society, history, the "meaning of being," and, of course, philosophical inquiry. For Levinas there is nothing prior to obligation that might further ground or justify it; the prescriptive precedes every descriptive account of human nature. Obligation is the first "fact," what Lyotard calls a "quasi-fact" on account of it being given without rational or empirical evidence.46 Lyotard asserts that "Levinas' wager is . . . to succeed in placing the deontic genre at the heart of philosophical discourse."47 Hilary Putnam makes a similar point. For him too, Levinas's innovation is to have the question of obligation refer to no prior set of justifications (cultural, psychological, or whatever). When ethics is justified on account of natural human sympathy - because the other is like me - or on account of human rationality - because the dignity of reason inheres in us all - the way is open for an abuse of ethics. For in these cases one can always define such nonethical conditions that supposedly ground ethics in a way that excludes particular people or beings: for example, by denying the dignity of reason to some or by failing to have sympathy with others. "What he [Levinas] rejects is any formula of the form 'Behave in such and such a way because ... ,'"' to which Putnam adds the observation that Levinas offers us "ethical reasons for refusing to base ethics on "Jean-Frangoise Lyotard, "Levinas' Logic," in Face to Face with Levinas (ed.

The great challenge facing a contemporary Kantianism is that few people today accept that "a man necessarily conceives his own existence" as fundamentally rational (ibid.). In two significant but rather unknown essays, Levinas formulates his idea of ethics in direct relation to Kant; see "The Contemporary Criticism of the Idea of Value and the Prospects for Humanism," in Value and Values in Education (ed.

Here is the pragmatic bottomlessness of Levinas's ethics, insofar as they are grounded in nothing but the proximity of the other (and the ambiguity of the term "other" adds to the bottomlessness). The basic givenness of obligations cannot be justified or explained by any nonmoral account of how things are. If this makes Levinas's argument sound circular, that is because for Levinas human be- ings never live outside the circle of obligation. Like Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and many other philosophers in the generation succeeding them, Levinas situates the work of philosophy within life as it is lived, within history and language, though he gives special emphasis to the fact that lived life is normatively oriented from the outset.49 For this reason, Levinas's work is best understood as a post-Heideg- gerian Kantianism: that is, as an attempt to articulate or expose the irreducible and unconditioned character of obligation without relying on a foundational account of human nature or a rational determination of existence. In particular, I would like to emphasize that this move leads Levinas to a classical Kantian affirmation of human freedom, though it is one based on the priority of heteronomous obligations given in the face of the other rather than the priority of autonomously constructed obligations given by the fact of reason. This commitment to human freedom on the basis of ethical heteronomy leads Levinas to shift the traditional Kantian em- phasis from autonomy to responsibility, and indeed to cast responsibility in terms of heteronomy, for which he is better known. Now Leibowitz makes a strikingly similar gesture. He too denies that obligation is based on any further fact of nature or Reason, on anything but the very givenness of the commandment itself. No theology, no Book, no history can account for the practice of obligation as it has been lived by communities of Jews for hundreds of 48Hilary Putnam, "Levinas and Judaism," in The Cambridge Companion to Levinas (Cambrige: Cambridge University Press, 2002) 35. I should note that Putnam's view of Levinas diverges with mine on the crucial point of whether the basicality of obligation is some ethical experience of the other person, as Putnam (ibid., 54-55) and most readers of Levinas suppose, or rather the constitu- tive factor in self-identity that enables one's experience of other persons but can itself never be bound or identified with such experiences, as I (preceded by Jean-Luc Marion) will claim at the end of this paper. 49Gerald Bruns does a good job of situating Levinas's thought within these broader horizons of contemporary philosophy in his Tragic Thoughts at the End of Philosophy: Language, Literature, and Ethical Theory (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1999). Regarding Levinas, Bruns writes: "Here ethics concerns not the good life but the real one" (111). Or again: "Gone therefore are all the basic characters of traditional moral philosophy: the moral spectator, the self-legislating rational agent, the calculator of ends and means, the emotive self, the theorist of the right and quester of the good, and so on. In their place stands a human being who is in excess of the subjectivity presupposed by knowledge, propositional attitudes, self-possession, self-identity, the unity of nar- rative, and the justification of conduct" (109).</page><page sequence="18">18 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW years. All cognitive, theoretical, and historical explanations fall short of explaining the Jewish practice of religious obligation. In fact, for Leibowitz the very opposite is the case. That is, the practice of religious obligation is the very ground of the cognitive and spiritual aspects of Jewish faith; practice is not derived from belief but constitutes belief; belief is derived from practice. Not only that, but the practice of obligation is a self-justifying ground, a primary given of what constitutes being-Jewish. Whatever influences contributed to Leibowitz's arrival at this philosophy of religion as praxis, its conclusion is decidedly Kantian, and it clearly resonates with Levinas's project. The primacy of religious law, of the fact of religious obligation, leads Leibowitz to affirm the possibility of human freedom in a world that would otherwise be entirely determined by empirical facts of nature. Freedom would be impossible were it not for religious obligation and it is therefore "a postulate of faith"; it is "miraculous" in the sense that it is given to the religious practitioner despite its cognitive groundlessness.50 Now this is exactly how Kant postulated freedom: "I am justified only in making a practical use" of freedom while from the point of view of theory or cognition-- from any epistemological perspective-- free- dom remains "inconceivable."5" But as was the case for Levinas, for Leibowitz the moral law that gave Kant the Archimedean point of factuality to get freedom off the ground is likewise lacking; it is replaced by the givenness of the religious commandment. Only the fact of the institution of religious law triumphs over the causality of the world and the ruses of self-interest.52 It is worth noting the radical "5Respectively, Leibowitz, Faith, 96, 90. "5Respectively, Kant, Critique of Practical Reason, 56, 54. 52Were it not for this, David Biale ("Homage to Yeshayahu Leibowitz: Israeli Public Intellec- tual," Religious Studies Review 22 [1996] 311) would be right in claiming that Leibowitz's thought "works only if we allow a transcendent, spiritual principle in through the back door" in the guise of a "small but significant inconsistency," namely, "something in the human soul . . . that allows people to transcend their nature." Biale is partly correct, but not for the reasons he gives, which seem to me to miss the Kantian move which at once retains a thorough empiricism and yet posits the fact of the law as productive of the experience of freedom. If there is anything "spiritual" in this origin, it is not in the human soul but in the fact of the law, as both Kant (at least in the second Critique) and Leibowitz acknowledge by reserving the terms "inexplicable" and "miraculous" for the fact of reason that produces the law and thus makes practical freedom possible, and not for an immanent principle of the soul's own freedom. Freedom, or the ability to transcend nature, is therefore not a spiritual hole in the otherwise naturalized human agent but an obligation that one must assume, as if one were free, though with the full awareness that, within the limits of human knowledge, one only knows oneself as a natural being. Nevertheless, Biale's point can be restated more accurately. It is not the transcendence of nature achieved through the practice of halakhah that is problematic but the place Leibowitz reserves for the subjective act of assuming the yoke of the law. This is particularly problematic in the case of someone who enters the system of halakhic life from the outside (the convert or the ba'al teshuvah), for outside that system Leibowitz has no recourse to the postulate of freedom (just as Kant had no recourse to it outside moral life). It is at this point that Leibowitz indeed falls back upon a metaphysical idea that the system of halakhah does not itself produce.</page><page sequence="19">MICHAEL FAGENBLAT 19 conclusion to this position: for Leibowitz it is the institution of Jewish law that is significant before any account of revelation, so much so that the authority of the Torah rests on its institutional canonization and legal status, and not the other way round.53 With Leibowitz, then, as with Levinas, we have a formulation of an uncondi- tional obligation that constitutes the very discourse that would pretend to explain it. Such obligation is characterized above all by its resistance to reduction and its rejection of instrumentalization. Religious obligation does not reduce to or depend on any more basic insight than the fact of being commanded. This basicality of the fact of being commanded, is, therefore, fundamentally betrayed when it is converted into a means to serve the happiness of the community or to benefit, let alone save, the individual. On the contrary, for Leibowitz, as for Kant, it is precisely the dissonance between one's will and the fact of being commanded that attests to the true intention of the practice. As was the case with Levinas, it is precisely the heteronomy of the law that ensures its unconditionality, for everything that is autonomously produced can only have come from the empirical conditions of the agent. The primacy of obligation can thus be seen to have the educative function of edifying and exalting religious life, as both Levinas and Leibowitz attest, but this is quite distinct from rewarding or consoling the faithful. Two further points of agreement might now be briefly mentioned. First, Levinas and Leibowitz agree that concrete acts of obligation alone merit being called "love," and both see this love in daily service rather than inner experience or unio mystica. Levinas calls this love "without eros" and "without concupis- cence," love practiced in ordinary acts of everyday obligation that alone justify using this otherwise "worn-out and ambiguous word."54 In Leibowitz's terms, "The acceptance of the yoke of Torah and Mitzvoth is the love of God, and it is this that constitutes faith in God. Man's faith in a God who eludes all predica- tion of attributes and the love he bears for a God who cannot be imagined can only mean the readiness of man to serve God by observing his Torah and his precepts." From this understanding follows each one's acknowledgement of the endless and indeed thankless task of such practices, which Levinas calls an "infinite responsibility" and Leibowitz calls "the task eternally to strive toward holiness"; or again: "Performance of the Mitzvoth is man's path to God, an infinite path, the end of which is never attained and is, in effect, unattainable."56 This is 53Leibowitz, Judaism, 348. 54Levinas, Entre Nous, 198. 55Leibowitz, Judaism 44, and compare 45, 73; Faith of Maimonides, 22, 25, 109-10; and Avi Sagi's discussion of such passages in "Leibowitz: Jewish Thought Facing Modernity," in Yeshayahu Leibowitz, 172. 56Leibowitz, respectively, Judaism, 78, 15.</page><page sequence="20">20 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW surely what Levinas is getting at when he writes of "a growth of obligation in proportion to my obedience to it."57 Religion, then, for Levinas as much as for Leibowitz, is praxis through and through, and questions of theology are secondary to the fact and practice of im- peratives. This explains Levinas's negation or unsaying of theological language (the religious "said") and his rejection of the thematic questions usually associated with theology -his naming God "without evoking creation, omnipotence, rewards, and promises.""8 As Leibowitz concisely puts it: "the purpose of the Mitzvoth is to educate man to recognize that knowing God and cleaving to him consist in the practice of these very precepts."59 This leaves us with the key to the thought of both Levinas and Leibowitz, namely, the (Kantian) idea of service rendered "disinterestedly," as Levinas often says, or "lishmah," as Leibowitz puts it.6 This view of disinterested or lishmah service is the way each one's rejection of instrumental and functional reductions of religious practice is given positive expression. It thus not only characterizes religious action (and in Levinas's case ethical action as well) as the very manifestation of freedom but also conveys the full sense of each one's "faith," which is a wholly practical commitment to serving God. i Prophecy, Prayer, Providence It should be stressed that such a critique of religious reasoning is obviously not the result of a general, modern theology that sees Judaism as its supreme instantiation but is, on the contrary, an interpretation of Judaism internal to the praxis of Jewish religious observance. It is only in that sense that one can understand how the primacy of the religious act admits and even produces positive postulates of faith: that is, not only freedom, as we have seen, but so too the postulates of prayer and ritual which, as religious acts grounded in the primacy of practical obligation, produce articles of faith or dogmatic theology. Even theosophical postulates about the na- ture of God can thus be admitted, so long as this is done within the confines of the primacy of prayer and ritual as practical obligation and the authority of Scripture as deriving from its canonized, and thus legal and practical, status. It is on this basis that we can draw a final set of correspondences that make the unlikely correlation between Leibowitz and Levinas all the more compelling. Readers of Levinas have long noted the centrality of the term "prophecy" in his 57Levinas, Of God, 73. 58Ibid., ix.

"History is worked over by the ruptures in history, in which a judgement is borne upon it. When man truly approaches the Other he is uprooted from history."63 Prophecy is Levinas's trope for describing this uprooting from history that alone allows one to attain an ahistorical, transcendent, and unconditioned perspective on human experience. The move once again follows, or at least parallels, Kant, for whom the fact of reason, precisely on account of its ahistoricality, produces a morality that is able to judge the hypothetical imperatives of instinct and impulse. As we have seen, however, because Levinas follows Heidegger's reduction of reason to historicity, the fact of reason fails to transcend history. He therefore turns to religious language, in this case the term "prophecy," in order to find words that express such irreducible acts.64 Leibowitz also makes use of the notion of prophecy to develop his account of genuine practical faith. In his words, prophecy is "not a miraculous invasion from the higher world into the lower" but is "an ascent of man from the lower to the upper world of the knowledge of God."65 Here too, following Maimonides, prophecy is a general possibility for the service of God and is not restricted to biblical epiphanies. But the similarity to Levinas (and to Maimonides) extends further. For here too prophecy is the work of the religious agent rather than an infusion from above. 61Levinas, Otherwise than Being, 149-52; idem, Of God, 75-76; idem, God, Death, and Time, 202-6; idem, Ethics and Infinity: Conversations with Philippe Nemo (Pittsburgh: Duquesne Uni- versity Press, 1985) 113; Fabio Ciaramelli, "Levinas's Ethical Discourse between Individuation and Universality," in Re-Reading Levinas (ed.

Levinas first introduces the term "prophecy" to his philosophical work in Totality and Infinity, 24, but in the rest of that book he prefers the terms "infinity" and "escha- tology" to describe the idea of breaking with history through ethical judgement and response (25, 52, 240-42). 62Though the sages of the Talmud (m. Sota 13.2; y. Sota 24b; b. Sanh. ila; note also Cant. Rab. 8.11) agreed that prophecy had ceased, Jewish philosophers of the Middle Ages reclaimed and re- formulated the idea of prophecy; see Abraham J.

The use of the trope of prophecy by modern Jewish philosophers continues to be prevalent; see E. Schweid, Prophets for Their People and Humanity: Prophecy and Prophets in 20th Century Jewish Thought (in Hebrew) (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1999). Levinas and Leibowitz should be added to Schweid's analyses. 63Levinas, Totality and Infinity, 52. 64For example, Levinas, Of God, 76. 65Leibowitz, Judaism, 60; "knowledge of God" here refers back to obedience to mitzvoth.</page><page sequence="22">22 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Like Levinas, Leibowitz views the idea of prophecy as a cleaving to God through practice that breaks with the immanence of nature and history: "[T]he prophets do not present specific historical conceptions as essential to faith and to religion. They convey only the absolute demand to serve God."66 Leibowitz's "absolute demand" has the precise sense of the unconditional imperative that both Kant and Levinas seek. Indeed, the correspondence extends further, for here too prophecy is radically demythologized by being purified of all cognitive or imaginative content. What of that cognitive and imaginative content that the biblical prophets so vividly express? This, for Leibowitz, is a purely instrumental way of correcting errant religious praxis and says nothing essential or substantial about God whatsoever. The aim of all prophecy, for Leibowitz, is not knowledge of God but inspiration to serve God through the practice of religious law. For both Levinas and Leibowitz, then, prophecy is a category of practical worship that expresses the task and responsibil- ity of each person to serve God disinterestedly.67 When it comes to prayer we find a similar move. For Leibowitz, prayer repeats the act of "accepting the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven" and in no way affects any mystical or magical transformation of either God or nature. "To pray as one who has faith in God, not as one who worships an idol, one must recognize that ... prayer is not the silly and impudent demand that God change the world's regularity for the benefit of the person praying, but is rather a token of man's cleaving to God by serving Him, no matter what occurs in his natural environment."68 These austere and perhaps unfashionable views are likewise found in Levinas's reflections on prayer: "Prayer never asks for anything for oneself; strictly speaking, it makes no demands at all, but is an elevation of the soul."69 I would like to mention one last, and doubtless more oblique, point of conver- gence between Levinas and Leibowitz, namely, their use of the religious concept of providence. Leibowitz, relying again on Maimonides's bold position, urges us to think of providence not as an external divine fiat imposed upon communities or private individuals. That primitive if prevalent notion of providence both contradicts the principle that "the world proceeds according to its own order" and promotes the misleading idea that God's role is to serve us. Rather, says Leibowitz, there simply is no general or collective providence but only individual providence, which is, as we might by now expect, an accomplishment of practical faith. In serving God under all circumstances, the individual produces providence, for in that case God 66Ibid., 101. 67Ibid., 97-101. 68Ibid., Judaism, 34. 69See "Prayer without Demand," in The Levinas Reader, 232. Note, however, that Levinas allows for a recuperation of petitional prayer when it seeks to alleviate the suffering of the other (ibid., 233).</page><page sequence="23">MICHAEL FAGENBLAT 23 really will have been with such a person-for the person really will have been with God-throughout all that befalls him or her. In other words, providence is not a reward but accompanies or even analytically defines proper worship.70 The performance of religious action in difficult times is the very cleaving to God, and this cleaving is what it means for God to be there with someone in times of duress. Leibowitz might even have quoted Ps 119:19, of which Levinas is so fond: "I am a stranger on earth; hide not thy commandments from me."7' Only in answering to the commandments does one overcome religious alienation and the vicissitudes of life and thereby live providentially. Moreover, for religious practice to be true service of God and not merely self-service, providence must provide no reward, for rewarding religious service would reinscribe it in an instrumental economy. Only the absence of a reward that would provide providential confirmation allows for genuine religious service, for the giving of reward would belie the very possibility of genuinely disinterested service. The measure of religious desire is thus marked by the withdrawal of providential signs. A similar notion of providence can be discerned in Levinas. For him, genuine work "requires an ingratitude of the other; gratitude would be the return of the movement to its origin."72 The problem of ethical providence might be put thus: How can I know that the action I perform for the sake of the other meets with the approval of the other? Like his Israeli counterpart, Levinas suggests that I alone must take responsibility for producing this confirmation between my responsibil- ity and the desire of the other, and indeed that it is only the absence of the other's confirmation, approval and gratitude that enables genuinely disinterested service.73 This is how I read Levinas's idea that "I find the order in my response itself,... [it is an order] which I hear in my own saying. It is an august command, but one that does not constrain or dominate and leaves me outside of any correlation with its source."74 I see this in terms of providence because it suggests that my proximity to the other is entirely in my hands and not at all a function of the other's inter- vention; indeed, I can have no empirical or phenomenological evidence for any correlation between my responsibility and the will of the other. Like Leibowitz's idea of providence, Levinas suggests that all is for the sake of the other and yet 70Leibowitz, Judaism, 57-60; idem, Faith of Maimonides, 78-79. 71Cited by Levinas in, for example, Beyond the Verse, 132. 72Levinas, Collected Philosophical Papers, 92.

Peggy Kamuf; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994); and Robyn Horner, Rethinking God as Gift: Marion, Derrida, and the Limits of Phenomenology (New York: Fordham University Press, 2001). 73For example, Levinas suggests that genuine work (aeuvre) "requires an ingratitude of the other; gratitude would be the return of the movement to its origin" (Collected Philosophical Papers, 92). 74Levinas, Otherwise than Being, 160.</page><page sequence="24">24 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW there can be no confirmation of my work besides proximity to the other, for which I alone am responsible. * Just Reading I would like to conclude by unpacking the hermeneutic that has guided this com- parative study. When it comes to the relation between religion and ethics, Levinas and Leibowitz apparently hold opposing positions. Leibowitz is clearly interested in purifying practical faith by expunging self-serving (what he calls "idolatrous") impulses from religious life, and he counts all human values and moral constructs as stemming from such impulses. He seems, then, to be concerned above all with the relationship between the worshipper and God (mp - 1' pn). Morality, for Leibowitz, either reduces to religious commandment or, if it retains its status as an autonomous discipline, is aligned with self-service and thus with idolatry. Levinas almost never addresses the direct relationship between a person and God without rejecting it as senseless, amoral, or even "violent."75 He is clearly interested in religion as it manifests itself between one person and another (rrOnb : T'p), and invariably refers solitary religious experience to interpersonal life. Indeed, Levinas seems to think not only that true religion is realized in ethical relationships but that ethics enjoys a certain independence and priority with respect to religion. One might think, as many of his early readers did, that Levinas holds religion to depend on ethics but ethics to be independent of religion. If that were the case, however, we ought to be all the more surprised or even perplexed at the correlation between Levinas's ethics and Leibowitz's manifestly antiethical account of religion. I have endeavored to show that Levinas's apparent subordination of religion to ethics is far from evident. While it is true that Levinas goes out of his way to reject theology, especially the epistemological thrust to theology, the same cannot be said for his account of religion considered as a system of unconditional praxis. From his earliest original essays through to his major works and including his several books on Judaism, every renunciation of theology brings with it a recovery of religion: "We have recourse to the notion of a horizontal religion, remaining on the earth of human beings, which is intended to replace the vertical one that mounts toward Heaven."76 In 1951, he introduces the term "religion" to describe the ethical rela- tion as one that seeks neither to know nor to possess but only to meet and address the other.77 In Totality and Infinity (1963), we find the term "religion" invoked 75For example, Difficult Freedom, 6-8, 14. 76Levinas, Entre Nous, 70. 77Levinas (ibid., 7-8) writes: "This bond with the other which is not reducible to the representa- tion of the other, but to his invocation, and in which invocation is not preceded by an understanding, I call religion. . . . In choosing the term religion--without uttering the word God or the word sacred-I had in mind the meaning given to it by Auguste Comte at the beginning of his System</page><page sequence="25">MICHAEL FAGENBLAT 25 again to describe "the bond that is established between the same and the other without constituting a totality.""78 While continuing to deny theology to the point of contesting every possible way of laying claim to divine presence, Otherwise than Being nevertheless once again calls upon "religion"--"exceeding the psychology of faith and of the loss of faith"- to name the fact of obligation.79 In other words, Levinas draws on religion throughout his work--with the "ethical resonance of the word and all those Kantian reverberations" -in support of his argument even as he rejects theology.80 One might even see him as articulating a religious critique of theology, which at one point at least he makes explicit: theological language destroys the religious situation of transcendence. The in- finite "presents" itself anarchically, but thematization loses the anarchy which alone can accredit it. Language about God rings false or becomes myth, that is, can never be taken literally.8' The result of this religious critique of theology is a philosophy of religion as pure practice based on the recurring if not constant suspension of metaphysi- cal and classical theistic concepts. It is thus an account of religion within the limits of modern, critical philosophy. It is a philosophy of religion that does not depend on the belief in the existence of God as much as on one's response to the obligations of everyday life.82 My final claim will be that for Levinas, everyday religious life articulates the primacy of given obligations as much as does everyday ethical life. of Positive Polity. No theology, no mysticism is concealed behind the analysis I have just given of the meeting with the other, the formal structure of which I felt it was important to stress. The object of the meeting is at the same time given to us and in society with us, but without the event of sociality being reducible to any property whatsoever revealed in the given - without knowledge being able to take precedence over sociality. .... I accept that ethical resonance of the word and all those Kantian reverberations." Of relevance to my general argument in this paper is that, just before concluding this essay which in no uncertain terms attempts to sketch a post-Heideggerian ethic, Levinas remarks: "What I catch sight of in that sphere [of interpersonal relations] seems suggested by the practical philosophy of Kant, to which I feel particularly close" (ibid., 10). It is also worth citing the concluding words of Levinas's important essay "Freedom and Command" (Collected Philosophical Papers, 23): "One could call this situation religion, the situation where outside of all dogmas, all speculation about the divine or-God forbid-about the sacred and its violences, one speaks to the other. We have taken the position that commanding is speech, or that the true speech, speech in its essence, is commanding." 78Levinas, Totality and Infinity, 40; compare 68, 80. 79Idem, Otherwise than Being, 168. 80Idem, Entre Nous, 8. "Idem, Otherwise than Being, 197 n. 25; my emphasis. 82Introducing his most explicitly theological work, Levinas says: "This investigation was car- ried out independently of the problem of the existence or non-existence of God" (Of God, xi; see also Of God, 62-63, 75).</page><page sequence="26">26 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW * Beyond the Other: Toward a Rereading of Levinas Now if Levinas recuperates religion even as he rejects theology, then this only high- lights another problem, for as Leibowitz persistently reminds us, even if religion is ultimately about service and praxis, it is service of God that is at stake. Leibowitz's thought is based on the centrality of God as the regulative Idea that orients the entirety of religious life through the commandments, and for all the affinity between him and Levinas, the attempt to cut God out of the picture would, for Leibowitz, be the greatest apostasy and idolatry. Here, however, I also think there is more in common between Leibowitz and Levinas than meets the eye, for there is reason to offer a second way of reading Levinas, to which I have also made recourse. On this reading, Levinas is counted not only as a philosopher of religion as a system of unconditioned imperatives but also as a philosopher in search of le sens de la transcendance, the meaning and the direction of transcendence. As a philosopher of transcendence, and not merely a philosopher of religion as praxis, Levinas might also be counted as a radically theocentric thinker and indeed as one of the most daringly "negative" theologians in the history of Western religion. This development is expressed by Levinas's increasingly vivid move from the face of the other person to the sense of transcendence. This was already the case, as Derrida noted, in the necessary passage "Beyond the Face" that marks the final section of Totality and Infinity.83 Responsibility to the other must pass beyond the face lest it lapse into eros or concupiscence and not only fail to do justice but in fact affect violence upon other others. Though Levinas insists on the concreteness of the face-to-face relation, his thought must move beyond the concrete other and refer to the abstract and only thereby wholly other. How else to justify the neces- sary distinction between the other as destitute and the other as perpetrator?84 How else to justify saying "no" to this particular other in the name of another to whom one must say "yes"? How to avoid a pathological obsession with the other that disregards all questions of right and wrong?85 If Levinas's thought is to be situ- ated in the concrete world of multiple others, there must be from the very outset a distinction between the concrete other of moral experience and the abstract Other as an authority who commands.86 Only the latter bears ethical authority, whereas 83Jacques Derrida, Writing and Difference (trans. Alan Bass; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978). 84This question is perspicuously examined by Paul Ricoeur, Oneself as Another (trans. Kathleen Blarney; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992). "8Were it not for the necessity of moving beyond the alterity of other people, Michel Haar would be right in characterizing Levinas's ethics as pathological; see his "L'Obsession de l'autre. L'6thique comme traumatisme," in Cahier de l'Herne: Emmanuel Le'vinas (ed. Catherine Chalier and Miguel Abensour; Paris: L'Herne, 1991) 525-38. 86Jean-Luc Marion ("D'autrui ' l'individu," in Positivitd et transcendance, suivi de Etudes sur Livinas et la phinomenologie [ed. Jean-Luc Marion; Paris: P.U.F., 2000] 302; unpublished English</page><page sequence="27">MICHAEL FAGENBLAT 27 the former enables that authority to be given. In other words, the sense of ethical commandedness supposes the transcendence of the other even as it refers practice to concrete acts of obligation. Therefore Levinas comes to speak of the other as "disincarnate," "abstract," "beyond";" therefore he acknowledges that the rela- tion with the other is not in fact an experience but in the structure of selfhood;88 therefore he says, most poignantly, that to notice the color of the eyes is to miss the face of the other.89 Again and again, then, the rhetoric of concrete encounter gives way to an acknowledgement that the person facing me can in principle not be the authority of my responsibility even as he is included in my responsibility. Though it is to particular persons that I must direct my ethical response, the obligation will necessarily have come from beyond the other. It is to a sense of transcendence -the trace of phenomenality- that one must answer, even if one's response can only be to the person facing me. Incidentally, here too an exact parallel can be drawn to Leibowitz, for he thinks that it is not the detail of this or that mitzvah that explains the obligation but that every mitzvah is explained by the one commandment to accept the yoke of the kingdom of heaven. In other words, Levinas's conception of the "face" parallels Leibowitz conception of the mitzvah. Just as for Levinas every face refers to the normative authority of the absolutely singular Other, so too for Leibowitz every mitzvah only has one reason (n=r). In both cases the particularities--be they the circumstances of the other person, or the various reasons and functions of each mitzvah, such as aiding the poor through charity or celebrating creation through translation by Robyn Horner) has preceded me in this thought: "le visage ne reste l'epiphanie de la moralit6 qu'en se gardant indiff6rent A tel au tel autrui. Passer d'autrui a tel autrui, voire a untel, 6quivaudrait ' se detourner de l'imperatif universal-&lt;&lt; Tu ne tueras point &gt;&gt;-que dit tout visage" ("the face only remains an epiphany of morality in keeping itself indifferent to any particular person. To pass from the Other to a particular Other, indeed to One such Other, would be equal to turning away from the universal imperative--'You shall not kill'-which every face dictates"). 87For example, Levinas, Collected Philosophical Papers, 95-96; and idem, Of God, 68-70; but such terms are ubiquitous in his later work. "8Levinas, Time and the Other, 70; idem, Totality and Infinity, 129; idem, Otherwise than Being 148-50; and idem, God, Death, and Time, 213-28. But compare Collected Philosophical Papers, 54, where Levinas refers to "experience in the sole radical sense of the term." Levinas thus vacillates, occasionally presenting "ethics" as an extension of the notion of experience beyond phenomenologi- cal conditions but more often presenting it as an alternative to philosophies of experience, one that comes from an "idea" and thus moves obligation beyond all reliance on experiential conditions. In this Levinas again resembles Kant, for whom the moral law is less experienced than it is thought and constructed on the basis of the fact of reason. On this point, see Derrida, Writing and Differ- ence, 82-86; Lyotard, "Levinas' Logic," 135; Wright, The Twilight of Jewish Philosophy, 16-22; and Bernasconi, "Rereading Totality and Infinity," 24. 89Levinas, Ethics and Infinity, 85-86. This move "beyond the face" and even beyond the other is mapped by the course of Levinas's philosophical development from Totality and Infinity to Otherwise than Being, although we cannot examine that here.</page><page sequence="28">28 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the Sabbath- are not the final end of the act but are subordinate to the one ultimate end, which is disinterested service of the transcendent One.9 Once again, then, Levinas's ethics pass through the face only in order to surpass it. But to put the face, the very phenomenality of the other, in question is to chal- lenge the way Levinas is often understood, namely, as reading ethical authority directly off the experience of the face of the other. It is usually thought that the ethical transcendence Levinas achieves without the aid of the moral law is real- ized by a phenomenology of the face that describes the source and unconditional character of moral authority. This is true inasmuch as the formalism and the binding nature of Kant's moral law are indeed replaced by the ethical singularity of the face. That is why I have suggested that Levinas offers a post-Heideggerian Kan- tianism, meaning that within a philosophical climate which reduces the moral law and the fact of reason to the contingencies of being in the world, Levinas manages to preserve a sense of unconditioned obligation through the singular givenness of the face. Nevertheless, the face itself commands an unconditional obligation only insofar as it belongs to the transcendence of the other. It is the phenomenologi- cal absence of the face- its withdrawal to infinity and transcendence -that alone legitimates its authority. Levinas's "ethics" is consequently ethical only to the extent that a certain distance intervenes between the face and the unconditionality of the obligation. To do justice to what nowadays so easily gets called "ethics" we must account for a fact which Levinas has taught us to consider, that obligation precedes interpretation, self-consciousness, and even moral experience. There would then be no nondogmatic way of restricting Levinas's "ethics" to, or even of grounding it solely in, interpersonal relations. At this point Levinas's philosophy of transcendence exceeds and even strikes back at the privilege he seems to accord to the ethical experience of the other person. What is at stake in Levinas's thought is the obligation given through the concept of the absolutely singular other, not through the concrete singularity of the actual face. Rather than reading Levinas as describing the ethical project of a human life only in terms of responsibilities for other human beings, one should conclude that obligations expose me to diverse and perhaps incompatible beginnings. It is only on account of this move from the concrete singularity of the face to the abstract singularity of the Other that Levinas's "ethics" at once maintains itself as such, avoids collapsing into concupiscence, violence, or pathology, and thereby involves itself in the essential ambiguities of a philosophy of transcendence. In this manner, Levinas's ethics of transcendence becomes indistinguishable from a theology of radical otherness.91 The neologism "illeity" expresses this sense of 'This was pointed out to me by Melanie Landau. 91Derrida already said as much in comparing Kierkegaard to Levinas (The Gift of Death [trans. David Wills; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995] 84): "Kierkegaard would have to admit,</page><page sequence="29">MICHAEL FAGENBLAT 29 ultimate answerability not to the concrete other but to an Other that is, as Levinas tells us, "perhaps also expressed by the word God.'"92 And in a note to "God and Philosophy," he states, "It is the meaning of the beyond, of transcendence, and not of ethics that our study seeks."93 Of course he adds that his study "finds its meaning in ethics." But why "the meaning of the beyond" should be found exclusively in one's concrete relations with other persons is difficult to see. In point of fact Levinas moves in the opposite direction. Indeed, in one of the central passages of his later work he himself asks why this way of orienting desire toward a singular sense of transcendence is called "ethics" at all: "in the transcendence of the infinite, what is it that dictates to us the word Good?" Levinas's answer goes even further than this surprising question in highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing between a radically negative theology and an ethics of the absolutely other: In order that disinterestedness be possible in the Desire for the Infinite ... the Desirable, or God, must remain separated in the Desire; as desirable-near yet different-Holy. This can only be if the Desirable commands me to what is the nondesirable, to the undesirable par excellence; to another.94 The claim is that for God to be the terminus ad quem of practical desire is to reduce God to a conceptual or at least volitional object and thus give the lie to the disinterestedness of desire. For desire to remain disinterested and to avoid the conceptualization or reduction of its "object," it must be referred to a nondesirable as Levinas reminds him, that ethics is also the order of and respect for absolute singularity, and not only that of the generality or of the repetition of the same. He cannot therefore distinguish so conveniently between the ethical and the religious. But for his part, in taking into account absolute singularity, that is, the absolute alterity obtaining in relations between one human and another, Levinas is no longer able to distinguish between the infinite alterity of God and that of every hu- man. His ethics is already a religious one. In the two cases the border between the ethical and the religious becomes more than problematic." 92Levinas, Beyond the Verse, 128; compare idem, Collected Philosophical Papers, 102-7; and idem, Otherwise than Being, 147-50. 93Levinas, Of God, 200 n. 23. 94Ibid., 68. Indeed, from the outset "the Other" is ambiguously charged in Levinas's work. Clearly he wants to emphasize the otherness of the other person, but early on several alternatives compete with autrui, such as the otherness of the future and of the work of art; of what, speaking as a male philosopher, he called "the feminine"; and also of the otherness of existence itself, the il y a. Later, once it has become necessary to move beyond the face and admit to the abstractness of the other, otherness is refigured as the immemorial past, the trace, sensibility, the saying, subjectiv- ity, illeity, and God. Now, it has never been clear to me how it is exactly that the otherness of the concrete other person receives such a distinct privilege, and on occasion Levinas himself admits to the ongoing difficulty in discerning who is the other. Indeed, in Otherwise than Being he goes further by arguing that it is not the other who commands me, but that my very self has already been commanded by the absent, past, or abstract other. But if I have already been commanded by the absence of the other, then the presence of a human other is not necessary for the practice of disinterestedness, though it is surely a key hermeneutical way of doing so.</page><page sequence="30">30 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW alternative. Without this insertion of undesirability between the desired transcen- dence and the desire itself, the relation would collapse into yet another ruse of self-interest and immanence. Levinas's claim is that disinterested desire is attested far better by the ethical relation than by the religious relation with God. The lat- ter, he thinks, degrades all too easily into various modes of self-interest, such as knowledge, consolation, salvation, or reward. But this again merits comparison with Leibowitz, for the latter rejects theology precisely on account of its degradation into self-interest. Now, for Leibowitz this means that it is the givenness of religious law rather than an unmediated relation with God that enables the disinterestedness of religious praxis. One must therefore ask of Levinas: Is the human other the only nondesirable? Is the other person really the undesirable "par excellence"? Agree- ing in principle with Levinas's formula, Leibowitz would have us believe that it is the halakhic law and not the imperative of the face that is the sole way of acting disinterestedly. After all, the halakhic law, like commandments issuing from the other, is exceedingly, incessantly nondesirable. For all the evocative use of "ethical language," then, Levinas's philosophy has recourse less to the experience of the other than to the givenness of obligation in its everyday singularity. It is not the face that commands in order to ensure the ethical character of obligation but the singular fact of obligation that enables the moral experience of the face: Ethics is the breakup of the originary unity of transcendental apperception, that is, it is the beyond of experience. .... Obedience precedes any hearing of the command. The possibility of finding, anachronously, the order in the obedience itself, and of receiving the order out of oneself, this reverting of heteronomy into autonomy, is the very way the Infinite passes itself. . . . This trauma has surprised me completely; the order has never been represented, for it has never been presented, not even in the past coming in memory, to the point that it is I that only says, and after the event, this unheard-of obligation.95 Obligation cannot be derived, deduced, or intuited from the experience of the other; one finds oneself and one encounters the other only in light of its anterior given- ness.96 I should therefore like to say that there is an intrinsic but not an exclusive connection between an unconditioned obligation and responsibility for another person. This openness that I suggest we preserve within the idea of the other and 95Levinas, Otherwise than Being, 148. 960ne might say that Levinas returns obligation to its being grounded in nothing, which would bring Levinas back to Heidegger's analysis of the "nullity" of the call in Being and Time, as Jean- Luc Marion has shown in "A Note Concerning the Ontological Indifference," Graduate Faculty Philosophy Journal 20, no. 2-21, no. 1 (1998-1999) 25-40. Elsewhere Marion expands on the idea that abandoning the name of the other results in a reclaiming of a post-subjective self; see his "L'Interloqud" in Who Comes after the Subject? (ed. Eduado Cadava, Peter Connor, and Jean-Luc Nancy; New York: Routledge, 1991) 236-45.</page><page sequence="31">MICHAEL FAGENBLAT 31 within the givenness of obligation allows us to understand why the distinction between ethics, religion, and even art is so tenuous throughout Levinas's work, despite the considerable effort he makes to privilege ethics. The other person is not the one from whom obligation issues, not the only one at any rate, but one to whom I am obliged, one among others. The key to Otherwise than Being is this move from an experience of the other to a description of obliged selfhood, for the obliged self is constituted as such on account of its immemorial exposure to given, mundane, multifarious obligations. Now this exposure, since it is passive, cannot ensure that it will have been exposed exclusively to the human "other," much less to "the face." Levinas's notion of the obliged self that is not a subject because it is elected and exposed can only be as such by having been given over to every one that calls it forth. To be sure, other people play a crucial role in providing a means through which or through whom the elected self receives its first calling, especially insofar as they expose the self to language, but the elected self can never trace itself back exclusively to them. There is, rather, a gap between the origin of obligation and the experience of responsibility for other persons; the former is lost, immemorial, unnameable. Levinas thus comes to abandon every name we might give to the source of our obligations--abandons naming it "face," "trace," or "Other" - in order to consider the obligations themselves in their unconditioned givenness. But since the facticity of obligation displaces every genetic account of its origin, it follows that the name "ethics" says too much; that "ethics" requires its own unsaying. Religion, or at least Leibowitz's deontological account of halakhic life, is one way of unsaying "ethics" within the fundamental givenness of obliga- tion in everyday life. Let me spell out my conclusions. Levinas and Leibowitz appear utterly opposed in their basic views of the relation between ethics and religion. And yet several ideas that are central to each one are strikingly reflected in the work of the other. I have mentioned a critique of religious epistemology, a rejection of theodicy, and a convergence in their accounts of prophecy, prayer, and perhaps providence. All this centers on a radically negative theocentricism in which God is named in nonempiri- cal, nonontological, wholly normative terms. It is this practice of unconditional obligation that each identifies with holiness and thus with the only concrete rela- tion one can have with God. For Levinas the way toward this is through the face, for Leibowitz through the mitzvah, but each one has a concept of holiness, albeit negative and if not absolutely singular, which is the sole end and value of norma- tive practices. They likewise share a deep, if differently slanted, post-Kantianism that provides each with an ahistorical, unconditioned, deontological account of obligation that is not based on the fact of reason but on the primacy of a more basic imperative. For Levinas, this comes from taking on board Heidegger's critique of metaphysics, in particular his critique of the Kantian transcendental subject and the primacy that Kant accords to the fact of reason, while nevertheless pursuing</page><page sequence="32">32 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW an account of obligation that does not reduce to context but on the contrary raises the self above its historical and social conditions. For Leibowitz too, it comes from rejecting the moral law as a metaphysical postulate that cannot withstand the reductions of empiricism but then investing halakhic obligation with the very status Kant saw in the moral law. In both cases it is crucial that human freedom and dignity are derived from the possibility of genuine obligation which involves action done without, if not against, one's own interests. These convergences lead me to conclude that Levinas's account of obligation cannot be contained by what he and his readers usually call "ethics," by interper- sonal normative relations. Levinas must be read as describing the self in its original exposure to the givenness of obligation, which by every right belongs to no one, not even "the other." This points to an essential ambiguity that accompanies Levinas's thought and renders it at bottom an account of the primacy of obligation in general rather than a purely ethical account of obligation for the other person. Levinas's philosophical anthropology thus suffers the rich ambiguities of its subject matter. Such is hardly the case for Leibowitz. He simply defines obligation on the basis of halakhic life, and so there is no surprise that only halakhic praxis attests to un- conditional normative action. This has the strength of an internal explanation of halakhic life that explains its intrinsic value to those who already practice it. But there is no way for someone outside the system of halakhah to accept Leibowitz's position without undermining his or her own integrity. For if it is the practical system of the law that has the sole privilege of producing genuine freedom and genuine service, then anyone coming from outside the system is a priori barred from every means of acting disinterestedly. Comparing Levinas to Leibowitz allows us to see with renewed clarity how the richness of Levinas's thought as an account of human obligation as such demands that we abandon a narrowly ethical reading of it. Having drawn extensive and somewhat surprising comparisons between these two great thinkers, we were then able to turn to Levinas's work itself in order to find internal support for under- standing his "ethics" in terms that include religious and other everyday practical obligations. By Levinas's own light, obligations in general are given prior to the distinction between religion and ethics. Precisely because of the manifold modes and names of such obligations, the obliged self itself assumes diverse and at times antithetical forms.</page></plain_text>
