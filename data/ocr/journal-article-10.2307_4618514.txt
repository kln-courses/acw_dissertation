<plain_text><page sequence="1">Man in Machine Apollo-Era Space Suits as Artifacts of Technology and Culture Douglas N. Lantry A N INTELLIGENT OBSERVER once wrote, "beware of all enterprises that re- quire new clothes," an apt admonition when the enterprise involves leaving the earth's life-sustaining atmosphere and traveling in the vacuum of space.' Space is unforgiving; it provides none of the elements humans need to stay alive: there is nothing to breathe, no water; the insula- tion and weight of our atmosphere is absent, which is contrary to humans' long habituation to living literally under pressure and at a comfortable tem- perature. In a word, space is dangerous. To protect and sustain themselves in this most inhospitable environment, space travelers have de- pended on extraordinary devices. Some of these are space suits used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) during Project Apollo, the United States' program to land astro- nauts on the moon. For present purposes, this pe- riod extends from about June 1959 through De- cember 1972, from the beginnings of serious planning for "moon suits" to the end of the last Apollo moon flight. This discussion sketches the suits' historical and material development and makes observations about what their design, construction, and use can tell us about technology in recent history. In their time, Apollo space suits were likely the most com- plex clothing ever made, and they share character- istics of both garments and machines. Moreover, they offer special opportunities to study modern material culture in a historical context. On other levels, their development and use is simultaneously deterministic and indeterminate, and the circum- stances of their existence provide evidence of their technology's socially constructed character. Combining an explanation of form and func- tion with an interpretation of meaning will show that Apollo-era space suits acted as the junction of man and machine in a complex technological system; that people gave technology the appear- ance of agency in this case; that motivation in this technological endeavor is most usefully located at the personal, not institutional, level; and that these artifacts have significance outside their narrow op- erational function. The following discussion ap- proaches these themes first by describing the arti- fact at hand and finally by outlining the roles of engineers, fabricators, and end users in space suit development and operation. Space and Space Suits We depend on the content of our atmosphere and the pressure it exerts on our bodies to allow us to breathe and to maintain our body fluids as liquids. Douglas N.

This is where space suits enter the picture. A space suit is a complicated anthropomorphic balloon containing a portable atmosphere; it en- closes the entire body and must permit normal body functions such as breathing and sweating. The main drawback of space suits has been their tendency to become rigid and difficult to move or work in when "pressurized," or filled with gas, though they are reasonably pliable when vented. As well as providing breathable air and the gas pressure needed by our bodies, the suit must thermally insulate its wearer, keeping its mini- atmosphere's temperature comfortable and rela- tively constant in an environment where no filter- ing curtain of air mediates between the suit and direct solar radiation. Objects in space gain or lose heat according to their exposure to the sun; space suit surfaces must withstand acquired tempera- tures of about - 25o00F to + 25o00F. Finally, space suits meant to be used outside of a spacecraft must provide protection from micrometeoroids, tiny, fast-moving dust particles that could easily punc- ture an unprotected space suit.3 The spacecraft provides greater pressure, tem- perature, and micrometeoroid protection for as- tronauts than space suits do. One function of a suit, then, is as backup for the spacecraft, offering an extra layer of protection if the craft's controlled atmosphere escapes through accident or malfunc- tion. But when worn during "extravehicular activ- ity" (EVA, or work outside the spacecraft), space suits are an astronaut's sole protection from the dangers of space. Artifacts: Problems, Solutions, and Symbols Apollo's Predecessors Even before NASA started testing rocket boosters for its pioneering Mercury project in 1959, it be- gan thinking about more complex Project Gemini missions and about ultimately going to the moon with Project Apollo. In June of that year, NASA's Research Steering Committee on Manned Space Flight divided areas of research, assigning tasks to NASA's several departments; it directed a commit- tee of experts at NASA's Langley High Speed Flight Station, near Washington, D.C., to consider requirements for space suits to be worn on moon missions.4 At that point, space suit development was just beginning. As planners hybridized aviation pres- sure suits for Project Mercury flights and made more advanced suits for Gemini flights, Apollo suit study continued. Designers planned Apollo gar- ments for the moon while projects Mercury and Gemini continued to provide earth-orbital experi- ence. During the period 1959-64, NASA identi- fied the key requirements for Apollo space suits. These new needs can best be understood in comparison to earlier requirements for Mercury and Gemini suits.5 Suits in these programs were primarily intended as backup to the pressurized spacecraft in case the capsules' pressure vessels failed; they were also meant to allow the astronaut some freedom of motion in both the fully enclosed and pressurized state and the vented state (with helmet and gloves off). Mercury garments, made by B. F. Goodrich and the David Clark Company, were uncomfort- able and stiff when pressurized, allowing only min- imal movement. This was acceptable, however, because those suits were for strictly inside-the- spacecraft or "intravehicular" use, and Mercury ships had practically no room for movement any- way. Mercury astronauts never left their spacecraft during flight, and their suits were designed to be worn continuously for up to twenty-four hours. 2 Richard Harding, Survival in Space (London: Routledge, 1989), pp. 3-6.

Moreover, for the first time, the suits had to protect crews from the vacuum of space as astronauts began leaving their craft to perform EVAs. Mobility was a must for Gemini crews as they perfected techniques for spacewalking and working in microgravity. As development continued, NASA planners identified several musts for the Apollo suit. Since astronauts would exit and travel far from their ships on the moon, the suits had to have their own oxygen supplies. Whereas earlier suits had been connected to on-board life support systems, now they had to operate independently of the space- craft. The suits also needed to be flexible enough to allow wearers to climb, walk, and crouch as they moved from one spacecraft to another and per- formed lunar experiments, and the garments had to withstand long periods on the lunar surface. Cooling systems also needed improvement; simply circulating oxygen through the suits proved insuf- ficient during sweaty, exhausting EVAs when as- tronauts struggled against their rigid suits in the difficult zero-gravity environment. Tired, over- heated crews would be ineffective on the moon.6 Throughout the Apollo era, NASA's space suit development efforts were centered at the Manned Spacecraft Center (now called Johnson Space Cen- ter) in Houston. It was there that crews trained and that "mission control" directed flights after they were launched from Florida. At the Manned Spacecraft Center, the Crew Systems Division was responsible for seeing that space suits were de- signed, built, and tested, and it negotiated con- tracts for their production with private industry. The division also directed in-house design and fab- rication of some suit elements. Choosing a Contractor New suits with significant improvements over con- ventional models were needed for Apollo's ardu- ous missions. The Apollo "pressure garment as- semblies" (PGAs) were necessarily a step up from anything built before; a whole new environment (the moon) and ambitious plans for long work pe- riods outside the spacecraft meant NASA crews would need a new set of clothes for lunar travel. New suits had to be developed quickly if a moon landing was to be achieved in the 1960s, as President John F. Kennedy had directed in 1961.7 By that time, NASA was already working on the problem. About a month after Kennedy an- nounced the moon-in-a-decade goal, the space agency began the process of choosing space suit contractors through a design competition. For years, both B. F. Goodrich and the David Clark Company had been involved in solving the physiological problems of high-altitude flight, and both had submitted design entries to NASA for Mercury and Gemini space suits. A third firm, In- ternational Latex Corporation (ILC) of Dover, Delaware (the eventual maker of Apollo suits), also competed for the Mercury contract but was not chosen. Because the new Apollo suits would have to op- erate independent of the spacecraft during moon- walks, the basic suit, or PGA, needed a strap-on backpack or "portable life support system" (PLSS), a machine that would circulate life-sustaining oxy- gen and liquid through the suit. Combined, the PGA and PLSS became the "extravehicular mobil- ity unit," or EMU. Creating the PGA and PLSS were distinct engi- neering tasks, and NASA decided that each should be handled by a separate contractor. Under this plan, NASA invited fifteen firms, among them Goodrich, Clark, ILC, and United Aircraft's Ham- ilton Standard Division of Windsor Locks, Con- necticut, to submit entries for evaluation. Three serious candidate combinations emerged: David Clark (PGA) and Hamilton Standard (PLSS); In- ternational Latex Corporation (PGA) and Westing- house (PLSS); and B. F. Goodrich (PGA only). NASA judged each firm's prototype in June 1962. Hamilton Standard's backpack worked best, while ILC's suit was chosen as superior. Because of Hamilton Standard's size and organizational capabilities, NASA tapped the firm to control the overall EMU program and build the PLSS; ILC would make PGAs as Hamilton Standard's subcon- tractor. In October 1962, NASA signed a $1.55 million contract with Hamilton Standard.8 6 Hays, "Space Suits," pp. 165-66. 7 John F.

Block 1 included flights that would only orbit the Earth, to prove the reliability of the Apollo spacecraft and the feasibility of moon-flight procedures. Block 2 missions would land briefly on the moon. Block 3 missions would feature extended moon explorations lasting up to two weeks. Each phase required different and in- creasingly ambitious equipment needs, and NASA accordingly divided space suits into corresponding blocks. Block 3 failed to materialize, however, and its suits never evolved beyond prototypes.9 The Apollo program culminated in relatively brief Block 2 lunar sojourns of up to three days. Block 1 suits were to be less complex than later models because no extravehicular activity was planned for them, and so they needed no micro- meteoroid protection. But the suits had to be flex- ible in order to prove that astronauts could per- form useful work while wearing them, and they needed to be donned and doffed with reasonable ease in a cramped, weightless cabin. Unlike Mer- cury and Gemini astronauts, Apollo crews could remove their suits and rely on the spacecraft to protect them as a matter of course. Except during launch and lunar activities, when the integrity of the ship would be sorely tested, three-man Apollo crews would stow their bulky PGAs and instead wear light, two-piece coveralls in the "shirtsleeve" environment of their spacecraft.'0 The shirtsleeve aspect, which involved chang- ing into and out of space suits in mid flight, was not a simple decision; it was a marked departure from previous practice. NASA engineers felt that a shirtsleeve environment would be more comfort- able for Apollo crews and that it would build astro- naut confidence in the spacecraft's capabilities through reliance on the ship's integrity without ad- ditional protection. Engineers also felt that limited wear was best for space suit reliability because less use meant less chance of damage, which in turn meant suits would be more likely to work when they had to. Still, NASA planners had to be confident in the spacecraft's construction to let astronauts discard, even temporarily, the traditional safety margin that space suits provided. If a window or hatch blew out with the crew unsuited, or even partially suited, explosive decompression would be so rapid that none would have time to don anything, much less a suit, a helmet, two gloves, and several umbili- cals in a cramped space." In the end, designers, mission planners, and crews settled on a shirtsleeve environment, placing their trust in North American Aviation's skill in building a safe command module. The first manned Apollo flight of Block 1, however, was planned as a fully suited flight to provide a margin of safety while the command module was put through its paces in orbit. Assuming everything went well the first time, all subsequent Apollo mis- sions would use the shirtsleeve cabin atmosphere. ILC's Fall and Redemption In early 1963, Hamilton Standard/ILC Industries delivered prototype Block 1 suits, based on ILC's winning 1962 design, to NASA Crew Systems and North American Aviation for evaluation, but sev- eral problems were evident.'2 As mentioned above, space suit design is reciprocal with spacecraft de- sign; each affects the other's shape and functional requirements. The two, with a laundry list of other systems, must work together correctly to ensure success. In the case of the Apollo program, the pressure garments and the command module did not immediately match. The suits were too wide in the shoulders for the three couches in the command module, and they were too restrictive to allow astronauts to reach and operate some of the controls (fig. i). Also, vision downwards while seated was blocked by the bottom of the helmet. The difficulties with ILC's suits, plus problems of late deliveries and poor cost containment, frustrated NASA. In sum, ILC's suits were too big, too stiff, too expensive, and not on hand when promised. By May 1964, the agency decided to substitute modified Gemini suits for Block 1 missions to save time in the moon 9 The reasons for Block 3's demise are political and budget- ary and beyond the scope of this work. Block 3 suits were meant to be "hard suits" or exoskeletal shells, very different from the flexible fabric "soft suits" of Blocks 1 and 2. See Kozloski, U.S. Space Gear, pp. 145-68, for a discussion of hard suits. 10 In Gemini, i crewman of 2 had to be suited at all times, but on later missions they could switch off and get comfortable by shedding their suits.

Hamilton Standard/ILC space suit deemed too wide for the Apollo spacecraft, 1964. (Photo, NASA.) race.'3 But beyond Block 1, Gemini suits would not suffice because of the demands of EVA indepen- dent of spacecraft. Gemini astronauts performed EVAs but were always tethered to the mother ship by oxygen-bearing umbilicals. The renewed use of Gemini-style suits coupled with early Apollo requirements resulted in a space suit dubbed the "Aponi" (Apollo plus Gemini). In official NASA parlance, this was the AiC suit: A for Apollo; I for the model number; and C for David Clark Company, the firm that built Gemini suits. Its modifications, approved by Crew Systems in January 1965, made Gemini oxygen and electri- cal connections compatible with the Apollo com- mand module and provided a protective shell for each crewman's helmet visor.14 The problems with ILC and its products also frustrated overall PGA and EMU program man- ager Hamilton Standard, along with NASA staff- ers in Crew Systems and other departments. Wor- ried that ILC's Block 2 efforts might also fail, NASA needed a fall-back plan. Consequently, Da- vid Clark reentered the Block 2 picture, receiving the go-ahead and $176,000 from NASA in early 1965 to produce a Block 2 backup design in case ILC failed again. Then things grew even worse for ILC; by mid February, the company appeared to be out of the institutional loop. Envisioning Hamil- ton Standard as the eventual provider of Apollo PGAs, astronaut Michael Collins, liaison for crew equipment needs, had requested twenty-seven Hamilton Standard suits to use in training during the next year. Finally in March 1965, Hamilton Standard dropped ILC as a subcontractor and pre- pared to build its own suits with B. F. Goodrich. The first manned Apollo flight was scheduled for February 21, 1967, only two years away.'5 It seemed as if ILC Industries was through with Proj- ect Apollo. Feeling victimized, ILC fought back. Its Gov- ernment and Industrial Division director at the time, Dr. Nisson A. Finklestein, threatened to sue NASA and Hamilton Standard because he felt that ILC had upheld its end of the contract. ILC engi- neers contended that concurrent and constantly changing design development of spacecraft and space suits was to blame for mismatches and de- lays. Perhaps the suits were too big for the space- craft-or perhaps the spacecraft was too small for the suits. Some joked that an engineer at Boeing made a ten-inch miscalculation in the diameter of the giant Saturn rocket and this reduced North American's command module by ten inches as well, squeezing the crew into a tiny space. What- ever the explanation, speedy development of inter- locking systems by different companies that were 13Morse and Bays, Apollo Spacecraft, 2:165; Ertel and Brooks, Apollo Spacecraft, 3:48.

In this situation, problems were bound to occur, and ILC was by no means the only contrac- tor that experienced difficulties. More than 50,000 design, manufacturing, and human errors oc- curred during production of equipment for the Apollo program, peaking at 1,8oo per month in late 1966.16 Realizing that legal action by ILC would slow down the program, NASA headed off the lawsuit by offering ILC a chance to get back into the space suit race. The space agency invited ILC to pay for and submit its own independent entry to compete with forthcoming Hamilton Standard and David Clark Block 2 designs. Finklestein accepted the challenge, and ILC developed a new PGA proto- type in approximately five weeks with huge amounts of overtime work. The new prototype, delivered a week late despite all the overtime, was called AX5L (for Apollo, experimental, model 5, International Latex). NASA compared the new PGAs from Hamilton Standard, David Clark, and ILC between mid June and mid July 1965. One account of the evaluation recalls that "a technician in the Hamilton Standard suit ... was practicing climbing a ladder when the pressure blew his hel- met off almost taking his nose with it. Mobility in the David Clark modified Gemini suit was so re- strictive, it was impossible to use. ILC won the com- petition." The mechanics of the evaluation reveal clues about the role of humans in the spaceflight system. In testing, mission requirements were par- amount, while human requirements took a back seat; a complicated scoring system was used to combat confusing "subjective" judgments and to translate opinions into numbers. How well the suits worked mechanically accounted for almost half of the total score, while their comfort level counted for less than lo percent: The needs of the machine appeared to come first, although NASA admitted that the "entire area of the suit comfort and the suit-mobility interface needs considerable develop- mental work. The question is whether loss of com- fort is the price one must pay for good mobility."'7 NASA was willing to pay, and ILC's suit came in first overall-first in operational functions and last in comfort. Vice President Hubert Humphrey visited NASA and examined the three suits vying for ac- ceptance. ILC's, being an independent entry, hadn't been outfitted with NASA emblems and ap- peared generic alongside the others. When told which one had performed best, Humphrey re- marked, "Well, I guess Brand X suit won the con- test, didn't it?"'8 The victory was especially sweet for ILC be- cause, having competed as an independent without NASA money, the company owned the AX5L suit. This allowed ILC to negotiate from strength and, by November 1965, to work out a lucrative cost- plus-fee contract with NASA worth $1o million.'19 No longer a subcontractor for Hamilton Standard, ILC now stood alone as the prime contractor for Apollo PGAs. The firm had gone from being shut out of Apollo to being a key player, all within a year. ILC Industries got the nod for three reasons. First, its AX5L suit was better than its competition. Second, ILC's capabilities, in doubt at the begin- ning of the year, had been reassessed by Crew Sys- tems and Manned Spacecraft Center management as a result of the design competition. (Despite the reassessment, NASA remained wary and put a res- ident troubleshooter on site at ILC, as it did with many other contractors, to provide immediate su- pervision.) Finally, NASA felt Hamilton Standard, while the leader in life support backpacks, was un- able to manage the overall EMU program. Prefig- uring a trend toward tighter control over and closer supervision of its contractors, NASA man- aged the EMU program after July 1965 and after November 1965 relied on ILC for suits and Hamil- ton Standard for backpacks throughout the rest of the Apollo program.20 ILC's problems did not disappear, however, 16 John Scheible and Robert Wise, interviews with author, October 25, 1994, Newark, Del.; T.

Despite the firm's resur- gence in design capabilities and NASA's re- newed-but qualified--faith, the company contin- ued to miss delivery dates and experience quality control difficulties despite the presence of the on- site NASA supervisor. By late 1968, NASA moved to improve what it called a "disappointing situa- tion" by tightening its control of spacesuit produc- tion in terms of "discipline and cleanliness." Hous- ton's Crew Systems Division had its inspectors check suits more closely to "afford higher confi- dence in configuration, inspection, and perfor- mance integrity" and generally upgraded its stan- dards for acceptable products. NASA strictly enforced these guidelines.21 But again, ILC was not alone among contractors in experiencing prob- lems in the Apollo era. Spaceflight and its related equipment are incredibly complex, and space suits (indeed, all space hardware) were then being de- veloped with precious little prior experience. Add to this the pressure of a deadline set publicly by the President of the United States, and it is easy to see how NASA's partners probably could not have performed flawlessly in any case. After ILC won its contract-and before astro- nauts wore the suits in space-the entire space program experienced a great, shocking setback. A Tragic Fire Halts the Apollo Program As NASA readied the spacecraft, crews, and other elements of Apollo for the program's first manned flight, innumerable trials and practice runs en- sured that Apollo was ready for flight. One such check, called a "plugs-out" test, involved monitor- ing the entire spacecraft and its systems as they operated under their own power, unconnected to any source on the ground. This procedure closely simulated actual launch conditions, and the three- man crew was fully suited, strapped in, and pres- surized in the command module atop an enormous rocket booster. On January 27, 1967, a plugs-out test was run with crewmen Virgil Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee inside the Apollo com- mand module, practicing for what was to be called mission AS-204 or Apollo 1.22 As the crew waited for technicians to fix a radio glitch, something sparked in the spacecraft cabin. Because the atmosphere in the command module and inside the space suits was pure oxygen, it made flammables unusually combustible-and the oxy- gen was pressurized to 16.7 pounds per square inch in the cabin, slightly above sea-level pressure, making flammable things practically explosive. In addition, much in the command module could burn or melt and emit toxic gasses in the event of fire. Among these materials were about seventy pounds of plastics, including nylon netting; boot soles, belts, and hoses containing silicone rubber; polyurethane foam padding; and nylon Velcro. Even the liquid ethylene glycol used to cool the spacecraft was combustible.23 Feeding on all of these, the small spark, proba- bly from a frayed wire, begot a roaring furnace in seconds; intense flame engulfed the command module and the three astronauts. The fire soon became hot enough to burn through coolant hoses and through the crew's "Aponi" space suits. The Nomex nylon material used in the suits melted at about 7oooF, and the fire probably reached 2,5000F, burning "like an acetylene torch." The crewmen were safe in their suits for about thirty seconds, then the suits' oxygen supply hoses were burned through, allowing toxic gases to enter the environmental control system. Grissom, White, and Chaffee were likely conscious for fifteen to thirty seconds after their suits were breached but then quickly succumbed to the blazing toxic atmosphere.24 The fire was over in a few minutes, but it took medical teams hours to remove the bodies from the spacecraft because the suits and other materials had melted and fused. Medical examiners con- cluded that while their spacesuits "had been burned through,.. . [the] extent of [bodily] dam- age varied" and that the three men died from "as- phyxia due to inhalation of toxic gases due to fire. A contributory cause of death was thermal burns."25 The space program stopped in its tracks barely three weeks before the first scheduled manned Apollo flight. For NASA, the fire and the astro- nauts' deaths set off a concentrated effort to im- 21 Ertel, Newkirk, and Brooks, Apollo Spacecraft, 4:274. 22 A detailed discussion of the fire appears in Brooks, Grim- wood, and Swenson, Chariots for Apollo, pp. 213-32. 23 Ertel, Newkirk, and Brooks, Apollo Spacecraft, 4:73; Wil- liam David Compton, Where No Man Has Gone Before: A History of Apollo Lunar Exploration Missions, NASA no.

The agency began to eliminate flammable materials wherever possible and to make remaining materials more heat resistant.26 This meant first halting manned testing in oxygen-rich atmospheres and then reviewing ma- terials choices. Among other findings, NASA's Apollo 204 Review Board's Design Review Panel found that wiring in the suits' communications and biomedical monitoring systems could wear and be- come an ignition source (though this was not the cause of the fatal fire). More significant, NASA be- gan testing new suit materials and comparing them to current ones in terms of fire safety.27 Heat- resistance testing had, of course, been done before, and materials with good reflective, insulating, and fire-retardant properties were chosen, but these were not capable of dealing with the unbelievable temperatures produced by the burning and melt- ing mix of plastics, super-hot spacecraft liquids, and gasses saturated by pressurized pure oxygen. The confluence of these factors made Nomex nylon inadequate as an outer suit covering. A fatal fire could have happened before Apollo, and NASA was simply lucky to have avoided disaster for so long. The agency was obliged not only to rethink materials choices but also to switch space- craft atmospheres from pure oxygen to a less dan- gerous mix of oxygen and nitrogen. New Materials, New Space Suits As NASA already knew, natural fibers would not withstand the harsh conditions of space. As with Mercury and Gemini suits, the plan was to stick with man-made materials, such as nylon-type poly- mers and other synthetics.28 About mid 1967, Owens-Corning Corporation of Toledo, Ohio, entered the picture. Research- ers at the Manned Spacecraft Center found that Owens-Corning's Fiberglas might be useful in space suits. Working with the company at its Culbertson, Rhode Island, research laboratory, NASA discovered that a related product called Beta silica fiber could be spun finer than silk and so might be woven into an ideal space suit fabric. Akin to glass, it was highly resistant to flame. Best of all, its melting point was around 1,2ooo0-,5oo0F, and it produced no toxic fumes when broken down. Following the fire and the search for new materials, NASA claimed a tenfold increase in fire safety among the new products.29 But so-called Beta cloth had its problems as well. Despite its excellent thermal properties, it ripped and abraded easily. To overcome this weak- ness, researchers coated the cloth with Teflon, which is impervious to most chemicals and very "slippery." This solved the abrasion problem, but because the fibers underneath the coating were fixed in place by the Teflon, they could not flex with quick movements, and so the tearing problem remained. Eventually this was remedied by coating the Beta fibers with Teflon before weaving them, allowing the threads to easily slip over one another and thus eliminating the ripping difficulty. This pre-weave-coated cloth was dubbed Super Beta cloth and became the distinctive white outer cov- ering of Apollo Block 2 space suits.30 Most other fabrics used in Apollo Block 2 suits came from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Com- pany (now called DuPont) of Wilmington, Dela- ware. More than two dozen DuPont products were used in different aspects of manned spaceflight, and the twelve used in space suits were originally developed for commercial purposes rather than for NASA. These included five types of nylon (in- cluding Nomex, Armalon felt, and Neoprene- coated nylon), Kapton polyamide film, metallized Mylar polyester film, Dacron polyester fiber, Lycra Spandex fiber, Teflon coating for Beta and Super Beta cloth, Teflon fibers, and vinyl Tygon tubing.31 All of these had pre-space program uses. For instance, Neoprene, once used to fill the "limited 26 NASA, "Report of Apollo 204 Review Board to the Ad- ministrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration," April 5, 1967, Apollo files, NASA Historical Reference Collec- tion, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C., reproduced in Launius, Apollo, n.p.

(October 1994); and on my conservation work with Apollo garments as an intern in the National Air and Space Museum's Conservation Unit, Dept. of Collections Management (June-August 1994). 29 Kozloski, U.S. Space Gear, pp. 79, 186-95; Louis D.

Before space travel, nylon had a long history of use in women's stockings, and the synthetic was simply adapted for new demands, as was Nomex, used by race car drivers and firefighters for flame protection.32 Velcro is another notable material used in Apollo Block 2 space suits. First produced in 1957 by a Swiss engineer, it proved useful for keeping small objects in place in weightless cabins. It was made of nylon, however, and its use in suits, on many cabin surfaces, and on loose equipment con- tributed to some extent to the toxic atmosphere in the Apollo 204 fire. After some refinements, Teflon, Beta silica, and polyester were added to create less flammable (but somewhat less effective) Astro Velcro, which was used on space suits to se- cure flaps over pockets and zippers.33 Other materials in Apollo suits included alumi- num and plastic. Gas, liquid, and electrical fittings, as well as bearing rings for gloves and helmets, were of aluminum, and General Electric's Lexan, a polycarbonate thermoplastic that is about thirty times stronger than plexiglass, was used for space helmets. Natural materials in Apollo suits included rubber (mixed with Neoprene) in gloves and joints and soft deerskin, used in the lining of the commu- nications skull cap that astronauts wore inside their bubble helmets. Finally, cotton was used in the "constant wear garment" that astronauts wore next to their skin. Beta cloth was tried for this garment, but cotton was more comfortable-and even though cotton is flammable, it was likely that astro- nauts were beyond help if flames ever reached the cotton through the other more robust, synthetic outer layers.34 All suit materials had to be used logically and precisely to achieve the ideal balance of space suit traits: slim yet sturdy, flexible but strong, and uncommonly insulative. The Apollo 204 fire meant the end of the AiC "Aponi" suit, so ILC had to work hard to improve its new prototype for the delayed Block 1 missions as well as later flights. Between May 1967 and mid 1968, therefore, the firm's engineers worked closely with DuPont and NASA to evaluate materi- als for flammability and characteristics such as ten- sile strength and resistance to tearing and punc- ture. Typical tests run by ILC included hanging 4-inch-by-6-inch swatches of fabric in a jar, placing a Bunsen burner beneath the sample, and check- ing for abrasion resistance with what amounted to a sanding disk. All of these traits were standard procedures spelled out by the American Society for Testing Materials, although NASA had a few methods of its own, adapted from the guidelines.35 From this process, engineers concluded that several types of nylon could be retained in PGAs, but the outer cover layers had to be far more flame resistant than Nomex nylon; Super Beta cloth be- came the answer. When they found that even Su- per Beta was subject to wear, ILC turned to the less flexible but more durable chromium-nickel metal fabric Chromel-R, and suit makers applied it atop Super Beta to high-friction areas (elbows, knees, EVA gloves and lunar boots, and back areas where the backpack would rub). Initially, Chromel-R cost approximately $200 per yard, but by working closely with weavers, ILC was able to both improve its qualities and reduce the price to about $50 per yard."6 The Logic of Layering Apollo crews had various responsibilities in flight, and an understanding of their job requirements contributes to an understanding of their clothing needs. First, each Apollo mission fielded three as- tronauts with overlapping duties. Having three crewmen ensured that the complex spacecraft could be monitored effectively and spread the re- sponsibility of expertise with the intricate systems and procedures among three people (although they could cover for one another if necessary). The mission commander had overall decision-making authority and performed crucial piloting tasks. The command module pilot was responsible for space navigation. The lunar module pilot acted as the primary systems monitor.

On Apollos 7, 8, and to, there were no EVAs; the ships them- selves and techniques for navigating space were the focus of the flights. On Apollos 11, 12, and 14, two crewmen were slated for EVA on the moon while the third flew the mother ship in orbit above them. Apollo 13 was supposed to do the same, but its flight was cut short by equipment failure, pre- cluding any EVA. The rest of the Apollo flights, numbers 15, 16, and 17, followed the same for- mula-one man in orbit, two on the moon-but also featured the non-moonwalking astronaut leav- ing the ship in transit between the earth and moon to retrieve experiments and film. Crews had suits appropriate to their EVA or non-EVA jobs, the ones meant for wear outside the spacecraft being bulkier and more complicated than intravehicular models. However, all suits shared some basic attributes. Apollo PGAs can be visualized as having three main functional layers: an inner comfort layer, a middle pressure layer, and an outer protective layer (table 2). The innermost layer, the cotton 37 David Baker, The History of Manned Space Flight (New York: Crown, 1981), p. 54.</page><page sequence="11">Apollo-Era Space Suits 213 Table 2.

For lunar descent and work, two of the crew switched to a "liquid cooling garment," which was basically a network of thin, flexible tubes secured in a sheer, stretchy mesh. Circulating water in the tubes channeled a working astronaut's body heat to his backpack, which cooled and recirculated the water. Liquid is far more efficient than gas for tak- ing away heat, but since the crewmen were less active in the command module than on the lunar surface, they were cooled in the command module by the simpler means of oxygen flowing through their suits. Next to the cotton or water-cooled ele- 38 Descriptions of materials and functions of Apollo suits appear in many places.

Over the basic comfort or liquid cooling layers was the middle pressure bladder layer, or "torso- limb suit," the heart of the space suit, which held the precious atmosphere. It had a smooth inner liner and a mix of Neoprene and natural rubber in flexible, accordionlike joint "convolutes" that covered shoulders, elbows, knees, hips, and ankles, and, in later suits, the waist and neck. Gloves had convolutes in the wrist. An outer restraint layer and a series of cables retained the bladder's shape against its tendency to balloon under pressure. Over the comfort and pressure layers was the protective layer, the outermost part of the assem- bly. This nonpressurized cover layer, called the "integrated thermal micrometeoroid garment," was a sandwich of thin films between strong inner and outer fabrics. Delicate loose-woven fabrics, re- sembling window screens, served as spacers sepa- rating the middle layers of aluminized films, which deliberately admitted space's vacuum through tiny holes. Thus the interstices between the suit's many outer layers used the vacuum of space to enhance its insulative properties. All told, a representative Apollo lunar EVA outfit put twenty-six layers be- tween the astronaut and the harsh outer environment."9 A word about design differences among cover layers is appropriate. Any astronaut who per- formed no EVA (including everyone aboard Apollos 7, 8, and to, and Command Module Pilots on Apollos 9, 11, 12, and 14) had slightly different equipment from those who left the spacecraft. Non-EVA crewmen needed less protection and had comparatively simple, thin Nomex and Beta or Super Beta cloth "intravehicular cover layers" in place of the complex EVA outer sandwich. In determining the layering scheme best bal- anced among safety, mobility, and comfort, ILC and engineers at Ling-Temko-Vought Corpora- tion in Dallas performed complex calculations re- lating material properties and expected space con- ditions, deriving formulas for how many layers of each material should appear where and in what thickness. Their work was shaped by what could be done with certain materials. Some could be made thinner than others, some wore easily, some were stronger. Exhaustive testing determined what would work best.40 In the end, all layers of the suit were "nested," that is, they were not attached along seams but were joined only at the ends of the cuffs, the soles of the boots and ankles, and the neck ring where the helmet attached.41 Inside the rest of the suit, the layers slid across one another like bags within bags, making the suit flexible and aiding its insula- tive function. Table 2 describes what came to be known as the A7L suit (Apollo, model 7, International La- tex), which was the basic pressure garment used on Apollos 7 through 14. Apollos 15 through 17 used a suit called the A7LB (A7L, variant B), an improved version of the A7L with, among other modifications, somewhat different layering, better mobility, and a few different materials.42 But there was more to the suits than layering; engineers had to integrate several pieces of hardware into these nested fabrics to fit the space suit and the astronaut into the larger system. Part of the appeal of these artifacts is their com- plexity, but describing them in every detail would tax anyone's patience; however, some of the more important accessories are worth noting to get a sense of the whole space suit. Gloves and helmets, unlike the integral boots, could be removed for comfort and to make work easier. Gloves had to fit perfectly and be flexible and tactile enough to allow the wearer to operate buttons and switches when pressurized. The gloves had to be thick enough to be safe, but touch was muted and con- trol sometimes tenuous, so spacecraft designers met the astronaut halfway with big buttons and stiff switches protected from accidental touch by little wickets.43 To make the gloves, ILC used plaster casts of each astronaut's hands with small bulbous spacers atop the knuckles to give the finished glove good bending points. The casts, covered in nylon tricot, were dipped repeatedly into a liquid rubber- " Wise interview; table 2. Adapted from Charles C.

The glove was finished with a fingerless restraint layer and an adjustable palm strap. Gloves joined the suit about halfway up the fore- arm and allowed free rotation; most crewmen wore sheer comfort gloves underneath. An extra overglove was used during EVA.44 Bubble helmets were made by the General Elec- tric and Texstar companies from high-strength polycarbonate Lexan plastic. Included inside was a headrest that doubled as an oxygen manifold, a Velcro nose-scratching pad (astronauts could not reach their noses in the helmets), and a V-shape nose clip to help with equalizing pressure on their eardrums as the spacecraft ascended or descended through the atmosphere. The helmet had a port for tubes that carried pureed food, a drink bag with a straw just under the neck ring, and a clamp for holding a food bar inside the helmet. For EVA use, helmets had a hard shell with a thermal cover and a selection of visors and eyeshades for filtering and reflecting radiation.45 For moonwalking, a pair of large, padded, rubber-soled overshoes pro- tected the pressure suit. Finally, the suits had a series of gas, water, and electrical connectors for attaching umbilicals to the spacecraft, lunar back- packs, handheld air circulators, and other suits. Although certain features were common to all moon suits, their design was not frozen but rather evolved throughout the Apollo program. From the winning model A5XL prototype to the final A7LB, suits changed slightly, according to the growing store of knowledge about working in space, with every mission. Change over Time and through Experience Once the basic form of the ILC suit was defined, it was fine-tuned by astronauts, engineers, and de- signers. From 1965 through the end of the Apollo program in 1972, the garments made by ILC In- dustries evolved from the AX5L to the A5L, A6L, A7L, and finally the A7LB. Some notable changes included additional convoluted joints for extra flexibility, reworking of cable restraint systems, a reduction in shoulder width, and changes in the outer protective layers. After the 1965 design competition, ILC stan- dardized the AX5L, which became the A5L. Be- cause astronaut training progressed concurrently with suit refinement, ILC constantly introduced slight modifications. As ground tests by suited en- gineers and astronauts suggested ways in which the suits could be improved, new features were incor- porated. The most important early modifications to the A5L included addition of convoluted joints at the ankles for easier donning, reinforcement of the boot soles with aluminum to prevent bal- looning, and substitution of pulleys for Teflon guides in crotch cables for added durability. The number of changes increased until the suit that was being delivered was no longer an A5L; it had evolved into something worthy of a new name, and it became A6L.46 NASA used the A5L' to begin Apollo training and confirm basic spacecraft design and astronaut procedures and adopted the improved A6L as spacecraft and procedures became more refined. In the urgency to beat the Russians to the moon and get there under President Kennedy's deadline, planning, design, and revision of all of Apollo's many systems proceeded simultaneously. As NASA identified new mission requirements, these translated into further suit changes. For the A6L, they included the addition of a self-sealing patch on the right thigh, through which a crewman could self-administer a medical injection, along with sev- eral changes necessitated by the Apollo 204 fire. Also, ILC made the thermal micrometeoroid gar- ment integral to the torso-limb suit. Originally de- signed as a separate bulky jacket and pants to be worn over the basic suit, astronauts found the ex- tra clothing hard to don during training with the A6L.47 The major modification leading to the A7L, the first Apollo suit used in flight, involved upper body width (figs. 2, 3). Because it was easier to modify suits (or even choose smaller astronauts) than to redesign the width of the entire spacecraft, ILC rethought the A6L elbow and upper arm design, providing a slimmer but still somewhat stiff ar- 44 Lutz et al., Apollo Experience Report: Extravehicular Mobility Unit, pp. 10-12; Johnston, Deitlein, and Berry, Biomedical Re- suits, pp. 553-54; North American Rockwell Corp., "Space Suits," p. 226; Kozloski, U.S. Space Gear, p. 87. 45 Ertel and Brooks, Apollo Spacecraft, 3:46-47; James Lov- ell, phone interview with author, November 13, 1994; Lutz et al., Apollo Experience Report: Extravehicular Mobility Unit, pp. 19-21. 46 Lutz et al., Apollo Experience Report: Extravehicular Mobility Unit, pp. 22-23; Kozloski, U.S. Space Gear, pp. 98-99. 47 Wise interview; Lutz et al., Apollo Experience Report: Extra- vehicular Mobility Unit, pp. 23-25; Kozloski, U.S. Space Gear, pp. 98-99.

Making the suit narrower affected only the men in the spacecraft; making the command module wider, however, would have affected practically every spacecraft system and slowed down the program. This was not an option. When mission requirements for Apollos 15 through 17 were changed to include driving a wheeled rover on the moon, the A7L was changed again. To mount and drive the vehicle, the astro- nauts needed better waist mobility, which required a convoluted joint in the suit's midsection, some- thing the A7L did not have. Crews also needed improved joints at the knees, elbows, wrists, ankles, neck, and hips for more comfortable wear during prolonged (up to seven-and-a-half-hour) moon- walks.49 Installing the waist joint meant that the suit's entry zipper, which had extended from the back of the neck straight down through the crotch and up to the lower torso, had to be moved-- convolutes cannot have zippers running through them because the stiff zipper would reduce joint flexibility and be subject to increased wear. The solution was to place the zipper diagonally. In the final lunar EVA version of the Apollo suit (A7LB), the zipper ran from the upper right shoulder front, down under the right armpit to the right rear waist, horizontally across the small of the back, and around to the left front waist (figs. 4, 5). Because zippers also could not cut across any water, gas, or electrical carriers, designers had to rearrange the cluster of connectors on the torso. Where the A7L had two similar vertical rows of connectors, the A7LB had two offset triangular groupings. Since the command module pilots had no lunar EVA (they did not have to mount the rover or bend over to pick up rocks), their A7LB suits retained the less flexible waist with the con- ventional vertical rear zipper and vertical connec- tor arrangements but incorporated the numerous and less visible refinements of other A7LBs.50 Space Suits as Material Culture Material culture is, in short, evidence of human activity or "artifacts in a cultural context." Human artifice produced Apollo space suits, and, as ob- jects, they can be studied in much the same man- ner that historians study written texts. In other words, artifacts can speak to the attentive and imaginative observer about their own contexts and so are viable as primary sources in historical study.5" Apollo PGAs fulfilled essential design require- ments for basic adequacy, but a few overall design aspects stand out in evaluating these objects. First, the suits worked as one component within a larger system. In NASA parlance, they had good "inter- face" characteristics, both with the human body and with the spacecraft. Integrating humans, space suits, and the larger machine was the most difficult interface problem faced by NASA because matters of comfort and personal acceptability cannot be measured, they can only be felt.52 Subjectivity was an odd note in an otherwise rational technical sym- phony. As the design team solved shoulder and elbow width problems and matched connectors and waste management systems, Apollo suits be- came compatible with Apollo spacecraft; the sys- tem became tightly integrated. More important, designers reconciled the suit with human physiology, refining the crucial junc- ture of man and machine in the space program, where the living being ends and a machine compo- nent, matched to its biological operator, begins.

The machine garments were reasonably mobile and compact, they fit each individual perfectly, and their compo- sition was well-matched-painstakingly so-to their purpose. Their whiteness, which was the "natural" color of a strikingly unnatural material, reflected the sun's fearsome energy.

These adornments em- bodied the patriotic character of the cold war space race, emphasizing American ingenuity and achievement. The mission patches represented democratic individuality and teamwork, the de- signs being chosen by the crews themselves. Some sported American eagle motifs, and most included either American flags or red-white-and-blue themes. Functionally, they inspired confidence and team identity for the crews, a vital requirement of the overall system.55 Fine artisanship and materially demonstrated skill distinguished Apollo space suits as individual machine garments of unsurpassed soundness and functionality. Those who built them, incidentally, did not see elements of fashion in their handiwork. A "pleasing appearance" was required of in-flight coveralls but not of space suits, where technical aspects of design pushed conventional aesthetics into the background. Suitmakers saw beauty in- stead in the carefully crafted operational quality of the object, of which they were very proud.56 Apollo space suits worked, and they worked well; crew equipment, in fact, caused the fewest problems of any major subsystem. No life was ever lost due to suit failure, and although ILC did not always meet NASA's demands, the operational quality of ILC's products seems not to have suf- fered. Among its American contemporaries, the AX5L and related PGAs were the best available and were wholly dependable. True, they were not always comfortable, but they were outstandingly functional, and in the deadline-driven paradigm of getting people to and from the moon before the Russians and before 1970, the suits were unquali- fied successes.57 Apollo space suits were and are exemplars of the sophisticated technology associated with space exploration. After all, these are the sort of artifacts made by proverbial "rocket scientists" invested in popular culture with knowledge unfathomable by most people. The character of the machine- garments supports this notion: They were expen- sive, exotic, exclusive, and singularly iconographic. The price tag for extravehicular mobility units varied but fell between $90,ooo each for early suits and $400,000 for the most advanced lunar A7LB. These figures include not only materials but also design, fabrication, testing, handling costs, and Hamilton Standard's backpack. The actual price tag on the first generation of A7L PGAs (with no backpack) was between $175,000 and $200,000 each in 1968 dollars.58 Because of the virtual cata- logue of DuPont Corporation space-age films and fibers used in space suits, they can be said to be exotic garments. We are familiar with nylon in clothing, but not many garments incorporate No- mex, and finding clothes that combine all this plus teflon-coated fiberglass cloth and chromium-nickel fabric is almost impossible unless one looks in NASA's closet. Accordingly, only a select few ever wore Apollo space suits. Engineers donned them for testing purposes, but the crucial wearers were astronauts. Each man assigned to an Apollo crew had three space suits for each mission: one for flight, another for training, and one as a backup. Over eleven mis- sions with crews of three, this equals ninety-nine suits. Backup crews also had at least two suits for each man and each mission, adding another sixty- six suits, and there were probably numerous others used for training and testing not accounted for here. In all, an estimated two hundred ILC suits were delivered to NASA for Project Apollo. Of these, only thirty-three were worn on actual space missions, and only twelve suits made it to the lunar surface. Those operational or "flown" suits have assumed a symbolism all their own as fixtures of fascination in museums.59 54 Beta and Super Beta cloth are strikingly white.

(PEANUTS reprinted by permission of United Features Syndicate, Inc.) Space Suits as Commercial and Official Icons At 10:56 P.M. EDT, Sunday, July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong took his "one small step," he was wearing what is described above, and he personi- fied NASA, high technology, and space explora- tion. His steps were broadcast live on television around the world, and the bulky, hopping form with the huge opaque face instantly became the predominant image of spaceflight, adding to a technological iconography established earlier by Soviets and by Americans in the Mercury, Gemini, and early Apollo programs. The space suit image has become a familiar and enduring symbol, appearing in, among countless other venues, television advertisements, Christmas decorations, and comic strips. Music Television (MTV) used the astronaut-on-moon-with-flag im- age in the 198os as a promotional image, jazzing up the picture with neon colors and replacing the stars and stripes with the MTV logo. IBM lately has used space suits' high-tech image to sell its "Aptiva" home computer. Even the ubiquitous Hallmark series of commemorative Christmas orna- ments includes a "Neil Armstrong" figure, astride a glowing moon, holding an American flag. Push a button and Armstrong repeats his (edited) famous words: "Houston, Tranquility Base. The Eagle has landed ... That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." All of this points to familiar no- tions about spaceflight: Exploration and adventure are romantic, high-tech is desirable, and moon land- ings are worth commemorating. The space-suited man on the moon happens to be the predominant symbol for these ideas, with perhaps the space shut- tle in second place and gaining. Other media have depicted space suits as well, notably Charles Schulz in his "Peanuts" cartoon strip in which Snoopy wears a bubble helmet (Snoopy is the source of the term Snoopy cap, re- ferring to the famed canine aviator's leather cap and goggles, which was adopted to describe the astronauts' communications carriers) (fig. 6). The Peanuts-NASA relationship was reciprocal; Snoopy became a space mascot, and Apollo lo's spacecraft were even named Charlie Brown and Snoopy. Snoopy stepped easily into the astronaut role. Of course he had to wear a space suit for identifica- tion, just as he needed a scarf and goggles to be a World War I ace. Not incidentally, outstanding workers in the Apollo program were recognized with "Silver Snoopy" awards. NASA uses the image of the Apollo EMU today in its own public relations. As audiences await the beginning of a space film at Florida's Kennedy Space Center, a person in a greatly simplified but instantly recognizable "moon suit" entertains by miming. No one can see the face in the mirrored helmet ("it can't be opened, we're in space!"), and the moonwalker is silent (sound does not carry in a vacuum). In this way, a symbol of space explora- tion, and especially of NASA's crowning Apollo achievements, is reinforced and passed on through the medium of the space suit. The image is effective. When astronauts in street clothes speak to groups of children, they re- port that youngsters are sometimes disappointed or suspicious. "If we show up in a regular business suit," says James Lovell, "the little kids sometimes wonder if there's something being pulled over on them."60 Children expect astronauts to wear space suits because the person and the technology are so closely identified.

In using a semiotic approach to artifacts in forming judgments about technology in culture and history, the example of the space suit, like many others, can be read as both object and symbol."6 They are literally ag- glomerations of sophisticated materials, knowl- edge, and processes and also signifiers of particu- lar skills, attitudes, and a political context. But what makes the space suit different from other kinds of artifacts used by historians as evi- dence is its modernness. It presents a different set of problems and opportunities than, say, ancient artifacts like stone axes or even newer things like vernacular furniture, whose design and use history may be somewhat obscure. The objects examined in this study are fully, painstakingly documented with serial numbers, voluminous test and opera- tional reports and analyses, and reams of technical memoranda. The advantage of studying NASA objects is that their material and operational histo- ries can be completely reconstructed. This may go some way toward solving the historian of technol- ogy's problem that "despite the 'thingness' of the field ... many of the issues that interest historians of technology," such as the social construction of technology and technological determinism, "are not easily studied through artifacts."" In other words, we can know the object, but it often cannot tell us much about culture and social processes without a lot of free-reign creative assumptions. But in this case, the amount, substance, and style of documentation of space suits provides clues to the technical culture that created the artifacts. The suits are extant and can be examined, in compari- son with full written records, to give three- dimensional reality to the ideas and thoughts of designers, builders, and users. But the wealth of information is also a chal- lenge. Instead of risking error by speculating about missing information, the historian of mod- ern technology risks either burial in an informa- tion avalanche or misdirection down blind alleys opened by multitudinous sources. This analysis, for example, relies mainly on summarized NASA technical notes and chronologies, patent records, objects, interviews, and secondary sources. Chas- ing down the complete set of all documents on space suits might fill rooms and would surely ob- scure meaning in favor of the object itself. There- fore, making choices about sources, rather than filling blanks in the record, is distinctive in this case. In the study of costume as material culture, space clothing is also somewhat different, again be- cause of its modern, technical, well-documented character. Most costume study concerns more con- ventional clothing with less voluminous source in- formation, but space suits are good subjects as cos- tume because we have a complete set, in which each example can be reliably dated, many wearers and makers are still with us, and the prospects for interdisciplinary crossover between the history of technology and material culture studies are prom- ising.63 Since the aim of both disciplines is to ask and answer questions about culture, the next task is to look at the people around the artifacts, to proceed from the object to the subject to explore the culture of space suits. Culture: Designers, Builders, and Users The Designer's Table Space suits are designed by engineers and con- structed by skilled artisans. At ILC Industries dur- ing the Apollo era, designers and fabricators worked together closely to solve problems and per- fect the ever-changing mix of clothing and ma- chine worn by astronauts. The engineers had to balance all the require- ments and restrictions inherent in space suits to produce something that was at once robust and flexible, insulative and thin, complex and user friendly. These generalities were born of very spe- cific guidelines for what the suits were supposed to do: They had to protect a man for a given pe- riod of time in a hostile and changeable environ- ment and allow him to perform useful work com- fortably. They also had to be light enough to use for training on earth, even though the EMU's 130- pound weight would not matter much in the moon's one-sixth normal gravity.64 But no matter 61 Steven Lubar, "Learning from Technological Things," in W.

To achieve the most effective union of man and machine, engineers and physiologists studied the whole range of human motion, applying the sci- ence of kinesiology to machine-clothing design. They had to pay special attention to what the hu- man body was capable of versus what mission plan- ners and spacecraft designers wanted astronauts to do. These considerations had much to do with where certain controls were located, how much space astronauts needed, and, of course, the forms their space suits took. Arriving at a viable design involved continual testing, which is a virtual religion among space program engineers, to complement work at the drawing board. For example, when contemplating the helmet vomitus valve, involving a tube through which sick astronauts inside the suit could vomit into an outside container, engineers suited up and pressurized a test subject, then administered a dose of ipecac, a fast-acting emetic. The subject vomited immediately but was unable to keep his mouth closed over the emesis tube, resulting in an un- pleasant mess inside the helmet and dark humor among engineers." Other design features, such as the helmet feedport and the self-injection thigh patch, had better results when tested. Real-world experience of success and failure kept engineers simultaneously involved in both design and test- ing; refinement was constant, and concept, proof, and rejection lived close together in Apollo's com- pressed time frame. Because NASA strove to complete a moon landing before 1970, Apollo systems had to be de- vised and proven by then. Scheduling thus joined material and human requirements as a major fac- tor in designers' work. An example of time pres- sures affecting space suit design can be seen in the case of the liquid-cooled lunar-EVA underwear. On Mercury and Gemini missions, suits had been gas cooled, but Apollo flights demanded more, physically, of astronauts. They would have to walk, climb, and carry tools and backpacks; Crew Systems Division found that a man's meta- bolic rate in a pressurized space suit increased fourfold over the rate in a shirtsleeves environ- ment. Therefore, NASA decided in February 1964 to investigate a liquid cooling garment then being developed by Britain's Royal Aircraft Establish- ment. By May, Apollo planners decided that liq- uid-cooled underwear would be best for lunar EVA if it could be developed within four years. Intense design study and concurrent practical testing followed, which necessitated redesigning the portable life support system to circulate water instead of oxygen and choosing the correct materi- als for comfort, efficacy, and fire safety. The liq- uid-cooling garment was ready for earthbound testing in 1968 and worked during practice EVAs on Apollo 9's March 1969 flight.66 NASA perfected the cooling system in time for Apollo i i's lunar landing, with development accelerated by Presi- dent Kennedy's 1969 target date. The engineer's role in making space suits was to apply technical knowledge, in this case cogni- zance of the limitations and possibilities imposed by materials and methods at hand, to the business of design, which is the process by which knowledge is organized to produce a plan for artifice and arti- fact. This process involved creation, testing, and re-creation, as seen above, employing the design engineer's sense of what could be done combined with what needed to be accomplished. To develop their knowledge and achieve workable designs, en- gineers need to experience their creations away from the drawing board in an artifactual, tactile, sensual way.67 For space suit engineers, this meant they cooperated and spent time with those who made their ideas work on the shop floor. The Shop Floor Engineers determined the material makeup and physical form of space suits, but they did not actu- ally put them together. That job fell to ILC Indus- tries' small army of well-trained and highly skilled women. When ILC won the NASA contract for Apollo PGAs, it needed more space suit fabricators and recruited from firms such as Playtex. Women who had sewn girdles and baby clothing learned to apply their skills to space suit manufacturing at ILC. Work tended to be sexually divided at ILC not through company plan but according to what 65 For testing as religion, see Howard McCurdy, Inside NASA: High Technology and Organizational Change in the U.S. Space Program, New Series in NASA History (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993), PP. 25-60; emetic anecdote is from the Wise interview. 66Morse and Bays, Apollo Spacecraft, 2:69, 132, 140o, 173-74, 204, 209-10; Johnston, Deitlein, and Berry, Biomedical Results, pp. 26-27; Kozloski, U.S. Space Gear, p. 91. 67 Conceptions of engineering knowledge and design are from Walter Vincenti, What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), pp. 3-15.

In the late 1950os and early 196os, engineers, scientists, and industrial designers tended to be male while factory workers in the needle trades often were female. These divisions were transferred to the task of making space suits; men created blueprints and chose materials while women did most of the actual hands-on PGA fabrication. At least a few women who were there report that relations and communication were quite good among designers and builders, who spent much time together trad- ing suggestions and ideas for the sake of increasing quality and efficiency.68 From engineers, fabrica- tors gained knowledge of the rational basis of what they put together, increasing their sense of respon- sibility for-or ownership of-the project; engi- neers depended on builders for practical knowl- edge of what could be made and how design might accommodate the limits of construction, increasing their ability to design effectively. One typical worker at Playtex first learned to use a sewing machine when she joined the com- pany. She worked her way up to stitching with four needles at once on a single machine, making baby pants; she continued for six years before moving to ILC to make space suits. ILC also recruited from luggage and dressmaking firms, and new workers had to adapt their already developed pattern- reading and sewing skills to the extremely de- manding task of making garments to which lives would be entrusted. They learned to interpret en- gineering blueprints, heat seal synthetic fabrics, sew metal fabrics, cement layers of rubber- Neoprene convolutes, apply strengthening tapes to fragile fabrics and films, and perform all the exact- ing procedures of piecing together the most com- plex clothing ever made up to that time.69 Crafting space suits for Apollo was a team ef- fort. Women cross-trained to be able to take over one another's tasks if needed; some workers made convoluted joints for knees or elbows while others made gloves, cover layers, boots, liquid-cooled un- derwear, and other parts of the whole. The success of Apollo A7L and A7LB suits-no major mishap occurred during the entire program-proves, say workers who were there, the effectiveness of this teamwork concept.70 As the Apollo program geared up, ILC out- grew its facilities in Dover and opened a new facil- ity in nearby Frederica, Delaware. In the end, workers made Apollo torso-limb suits in Dover while crafting the various cover layers of the ther- mal micrometeoroid garment in Frederica. At one time in Frederica, eighty-two women working in three different large rooms made cover layers on an assembly-line basis. Their labor-intensive work often entailed overtime, but, as they explain, the national challenge of Apollo and pride in their work compensated for that inconvenience. "Any company that was involved in that," says one, "re- ally went at it in a big way." Enthusiasm was a po- tent factor in ILC's, and Apollo's, success.71 Another worker relates a story that illustrates this drive to accomplish Apollo's goals: Roberta Pil- kenton had recently married when NASA called from Cape Kennedy in Florida, where Apollo 17 was scheduled to launch in three days. An astro- naut's suit had a problem with a thigh convolute, which was Pilkenton's specialty. The suit had to be repaired immediately because Apollo launches followed a complex schedule dependent upon the relative positions of the earth and moon and on the weather. The space agency wanted her to fly down to Florida immediately, but she wanted to spend time with her husband, and besides, she had never flown in an airplane. But she knew that she had to go to Florida if the launch was to take place, so she boarded a commercial flight-with a new convolute handcuffed to her arm to ensure that it would arrive with her. She reached Kennedy Space Center at about four o'clock in the morning and worked from five until the following midnight (with breaks for food and a shower) to replace the damaged convolute. NASA tested the suit, every- thing worked, and the mission was launched on schedule. Significantly, this anecdote illustrates an- other aspect of technologists' enthusiasm in Apollo: each small component among many thou- sands was vitally important for overall success, and a certain pride of ownership in the project, their 68 Foraker and Allen interviews. 69 Foraker and Pilkenton interviews.

Brooke Hindle has identified this en- thusiasm, or "exhilaration," in early American technology, and the ILC experience shows that exuberance lives on even in modern technological projects characterized by a technocratic culture and centralized control; see Brooke Hindle, Technology in Early America: Needs and Opportunities for Study (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1966), pp. 3-28.

Because the basic pressure bladder was far more complex than ordinary clothing, it had to be constructed in an extraordinary way. Instead of laying out big leg shapes or torso shapes and attaching them back-to- front at the seams as in conventional clothing, ILC fabricators started at the joints and worked out- ward. They would begin, for example, with a knee convolute, which looks like a flexible segmented worm with cables on either side. At its top and bottom they would attach "cones" of fabric meant to cover the thigh and calf. These carefully sized pieces would in turn be attached to other convo- lutes at the waist or ankles, and so on. At critical junctures, flexible connective lacing through so- called loop tape added to the limbs' overall integ- rity. Therefore, a typical space suit leg, from the floor up, contained a hard boot sole, soft boot up- per, an ankle convolute, calf cone, knee convolute, thigh cone, and waist convolute.73 After assembling the arms and legs, artisans covered them with "ripstop" fabric to strengthen them and help make them airtight; the arms and legs were in turn connected to the PGA torso sec- tion, extending from the shoulders to the upper thigh. The next step was to add aluminum gas, water, and electrical connections; pressure gauges and relief valves; the medical injection patch and a urine removal port, plus a brass-and-rubber/ Neoprene pressure-sealing zipper; and a selection of restraint cables and pulleys. When all this was accomplished, the basic bladder was complete.74 The complex cover layers could now be nested over the bladder. These were created from materi- als described earlier, and each piece had to be pre- cisely sized and sewn so that every layer was gradu- ally larger than the one beneath it. Stretch and wear characteristics of the several fabrics used meant that they had to be cut and sewn at certain angles so that the warp and fill of the material would be properly oriented to withstand stresses when worn. Most of the seams in space suit cover layers were single-needle lines, but there were also many double seams separated by a quarter inch. All of these were sewn with machines, but inspec- tion tolerances allowed only 1/32- to 1/64-inch vari- ances, making care and concentration premium assets for suit artisans. For added safety and qual- ity assurance, no jewelry was allowed in production areas, and pins and fasteners were meticulously counted to make sure that none were lost inside the suits. All totaled, building a single space suit took about four weeks.75 Typically, workers had to sew fabrics correctly the first time. If a seam had to be removed, the fabric had to be painstakingly repaired before it could be sewn again; some fabrics, such as the metal Chromel-R-used in the scuff-resistant patches on the knees, elbows, and back of the cover layer and in EVA gloves-could be worked only once and could not be repaired or resewn. All suits were made to exacting standards, but only the very best could be used as primary suits for actual mis- sions. Others, although perfectly serviceable, were used as backups and for training. In adhering to these rigid standards, one worker explained her drive for perfection: "Try to imagine. What if you yourself were wearing it? Would you want defects? ... Your life could de- pend on it."76 This ability to empathize with end- users was perhaps heightened for those who de- signed and built intimate equipment, like space suits, that immediately affected human perfor- mance and safety. Making highly personal, indi- vidual items that someone's life would be entrusted to focused feelings of ownership and pride and hence commitment to precision and quality. The nature of the product in this case did much to de- termine the character of its manufacture. Personal Space: Astronauts and Their Clothing Astronauts, the users of space suits, affected the shape, design, and construction of their protective clothing. Because Apollo PGAs were custom made for one person, crewmen determined the shape of each suit with no more effort than the physical facts of their bodies. Suits had to fit perfectly, and tailoring a space suit involved much more than the normal body measurements we associate with con- ventional clothing (figs. 7, 8). Sizing an Apollo A7L involved no fewer than sixty-five separate body measurements, including such esoteric assessments as "gluteal arc length" (overall length of the rounded part of the but- tocks), "suprasternale height" (from the bottom of the foot to the collarbone), and "inter scye diame- 72 Pilkenton interview.

These measurements involved both standing and sitting postures and flexed and unflexed states. They also involved measuring limbs and each side of the body separately as part of overall posture. For instance, astronaut Neil Armstrong's left arm extended just over two inches farther than his right arm, and his right foot was about a half-inch longer than his left." These differences meant a great deal for precisely fitted suits, not only in terms of size but also in terms of mobility and use- fulness for work. Incidentally, the fitting process led to a torso section that could not be altered, meaning that astronauts had to maintain their weight and body shape from measuring time to space mission, which could be many months, to have a precisely fitting suit. A few extra pounds could make work in a space suit very uncom- fortable. The suits' working characteristics were rigor- ously confirmed in countless training sessions on earth and in aircraft. On earth, engineers and as- tronauts walked about in pressurized suits in out- door, moonlike landscapes and duplicated lunar tasks such as setting up experimental equipment, driving the lunar rover, and retrieving rock sam- ples. Crews also practiced in several spacecraft mockups, some installed in a giant vacuum cham- ber. In one instance three astronauts spent a week inside a spacecraft in simulated space conditions.78 Because astronauts had to learn to work in weightlessness, they also trained in a specially out- fitted jet that flew long parabolic arcs, giving pas- sengers perhaps thirty seconds of "weightlessness" (actually free fall) on the downside of the arc. De- pending on the plane's path, zero gravity or one- sixth normal moon gravity could be simulated. This roller-coaster-like, zero-G training sickened many crewmen, who dubbed the plane the "Vomit Comet." Astronauts also trained underwater in a special swimming pool, their suits weighted to achieve neutral buoyancy and simulate weightless- ness.79 Of course, not all testing was so spectacular. NASA also carried out evaluations using tread- mills, cranelike devices that took five-sixths of a man's weight off of him while walking, and suits without people in them. The simplest procedure from an astronaut's perspective was carried out just before launch and involved reclining in a large, comfortable chair for perhaps an hour while technicians fussed about the space suit one last time. Pre-mission training, however, was physically uncomfortable, says one astronaut, because suits were warmer and heavier on earth than they would be on the moon. And, incidentally, the suits were largely soundproof. One could only hear people outside if they were shouting; otherwise, the soft hiss of flowing oxygen predominated.80 An important aspect of space suit operation concerned the intimate needs of astronauts and was the source of some problems during Project Apollo. How, people often wonder, did crewmen "go to the bathroom" in space suits? The answer is that the bathroom came to them. Elimination in both the A7L and A7LB suits was accomplished in two parts, called the "urine collection and transfer assembly" and the "fecal containment system." The urine system began with a bag worn about the waist and connected to the penis by a condomlike sheath. A hose ran from the bag to a fitting on the right thigh, which could be connected to the spacecraft's waste management system, dumping urine overboard. Problems with this system included frequent spills and some crew- men experiencing a startling pinch as they were briefly and inadvertently connected to the vacuum outside the spacecraft. When unsuited, crewmen could urinate directly into the spacecraft system without using the bag in the PGA.s8 Solid waste was more problematic. For obvious reasons, crewmen were not supposed to defecate in a pressurized suit. But in the event of an un- avoidable bowel movement during EVA, they wore tight-fitting, absorbent underwear to hold the waste until it could be disposed of. Fortunately, no Apollo astronaut ever used them; all defecation took place outside space suits. The underwear was an emergency measure, and NASA put Apollo crews on low-residue diets and colon-slowing drugs, with eager astronaut par- ticipation, to make bowel movements in space-an unpleasant business-as infrequent as possible. 77 Body measurements for space suit fitting of Neal A.

This involved doffing the space suit and then opening a rear flap in the constant wear garment (or, as some did, completing the maneu- ver au naturel). Thus prepared, astronauts dealt with their main problem, "separation, in a weight- less environment, of the fecal wastes from the crewmen," by placing an adhesive bag with a finger insert on their buttocks and manually collecting waste in the bag along with cleaning tissues and an antibacterial liquid. When all was sealed inside the bag, they kneaded the contents in the germicide. Finally, they stowed the bags for study back on Earth. So much for the glamour of spaceflight; as- tronauts complained about the repellent handling of waste and encountered problems with a too- small flap in the constant wear garment, which made bags hard to seat properly. Overall, waste management worked, but crews found the systems very unpleasant, and urine and feces sometimes escaped into the weightless cabin.82 Aside from the difficulties of intimate needs, the suits themselves served their wearers well. The men who wore them were satisfied and were im- pressed with the skill that went into making them. Workers at ILC report that astronauts became very curious about "their" suits when visiting the plant because they saw their names on them and remem- bered the arduous process of measuring for fit. Astronauts generally asked many questions, and a few left telling notes for fabricators: To our great support team at ILC, I can't tell you how thrilled I was to see and talk to the people who are actually assembling the suit that I hope may someday make it to the moon-I hope I'm inside it. We're all very confident in all the work you're doing. Many thanks, Buzz Aldrin Apollo XI And this: To the Girls of Frederica- Thank you for sewing straight and careful. I would hate to have a tear in my pants on the moon. Best wishes, James Lovell 1o4 crew"8 Lovell saw space suit-making as an art as well as a science because not only did the garment have to literally fit the man, but it had to work right all the time, every time. He recognized that the fabrication of space suits, as with many parts of the space program, had little or no room for error, and that pressure garments were more explicitly individual than anything else NASA used.84 When crews visited ILC for fittings and testing, they were most interested in comfort and mobility, along with manual dexterity. For a few, the feel of the gloves was paramount, and they had the arms of their suits shortened slightly so that their work on the moon with tools and drills would be more precise. Unfortunately, this caused injury in three cases. While no suits failed, the pressure of finger- tips pressing against the ends of gloves caused David Scott's, Eugene Cernan's, and Harrison Schmitt's hands to bruise painfully as they per- formed lunar EVAs on Apollos 15 and 17.85 One potentially more serious incident had clear consequences for suit design. During the flight of Apollo 7, all three crewmen got head colds and knew that they could not perform the Valsalva ma- neuver-pinching the nose, closing the mouth, and blowing hard to relieve ear pressure-with helmets on. They decided, against orders and nor- mal procedure, to reenter the earth's atmosphere without helmets so that they could hold their noses and Valsalva. Had their eardrums ruptured, it would have meant permanent hearing loss and jeopardized their careers as astronauts.86 Ironically, the crew landed without having to Valsalva, but their careers as astronauts were over after Apollo 7. For two of them, Donn Eisele and Walter Cunningham, the end was the result of dis- obeying orders to put their helmets on; NASA of- ficials believed that absolute discipline was re- quired in astronauts, and the entire crew had been contrary about other aspects of the mission as well. The spacecraft commander, Walter Schirra, Jr. (who had announced his post-flight retirement be- fore launch), made a cold medicine commercial some time after the flight.

Not all innovations devolved from such drama. A few examples of suit modification from practical experience in the areas of vision and mobility show that whimsy also found a place in the space pro- gram and that in some cases astronautics was not as sober as it might seem. While on the moon during Apollo 12, astronaut Charles Conrad, Jr., experienced difficulty with the sun's glare. It kept getting in his eyes despite his helmet's complex protective shielding. Upon return to Earth, Conrad explained his difficulty to ILC engineers, who always solicited detailed com- mentary on suit performance in order to plan up- grades and redesign. Conrad joked that he wished on the moon he had the long-billed baseball cap he wore in the navy. While solving the problem by designing a set of sun shades for astronauts' headgear, ILC workers also made a huge hat with an enormous bill that would fit over the entire hel- met assembly, and they presented it to Conrad with a smile.88 Other crew comments about suits involved vari- ous fittings and pockets. To help crews maneuver into and out of their space suits and couches, suits were fitted with straps above the knee. But after early Apollo missions, crews complained that they could not see the straps because they were white like the rest of the suit. But changing color was not simple, so ILC decided to add distinctive stitching to the straps in dark Nomex thread to make them more visible. Engineers asked fabricators for pat- tern suggestions, and one seamstress delivered straps that said, in large letters, "THIS IS YOUR KNEE STRAP." Assuming that their customers were at least that smart, ILC opted for a simple zig-zag pattern to visually set off the straps. In a similar vein, some suits have "L" and "R" symbols on the integral boots.89 Finally, engineers faced a stream of astronaut requests for more pockets on space suits. Aviators are fond of pockets, and Apollo crews were no exception; they had to keep track of several items, including maps, scissors, checklists, sunglasses, and pens. After incrementally devising more and more suit storage space, exasperated engineers finally delivered a suit with pockets absolutely everywhere a man could possibly reach. To their surprise, the astronauts liked the suit and wanted to keep most of the pockets. In the end, Apollo PGAs did sport quite a few pockets, including adjustable and re- movable ones.90 Space crews, then, were formally involved in determining the character of their equipment. An excellent example of this is the 1965 three-way space suit design competition at the Manned Spacecraft Center.91 All suits were made to the measurements of astronaut Michael Collins (among whose unique qualifications, NASA noted, was his ability to reach any part of his back with either hand), and he rated all of the suits in terms of comfort, donning and doffing, ease of use with other equipment, and mobility. Collins and an en- gineer also served as test subjects as other engi- neers fussed about the suits, making many and var- ious measurements and judgments. As noted above, the tests were designed to rationalize the suit selection process, but the aspect most difficult to reduce to numbers was comfort. This was Col- lins's job, and he converted his perceptions into scores, which in turn helped NASA choose a de- sign. Ironically, suit operation overwhelmed suit comfort in terms of weight in the scoring, but NASA acknowledged that ILC had to work to make a sound suit a comfortable one. The Project Ends Through Project Apollo, NASA had hoped to ex- pand the national commitment to spaceflight by establishing a permanent moon base and by even- tually landing on Mars. The program, which origi- nally had scheduled fourteen manned flights, ended after eleven missions. Apollo has been called a triumph of technology and technocratic management. Although moon landings trans- formed our vision of the Earth, most Americans lost interest in them after the first (Apollo 11). Earthly budgetary and other problems, including the Vietnam war and social unrest, drew attention and enthusiasm away from space projects. Moon landings were no longer a public priority after the 87 "Moon Shot" television documentary, Turner Broadcast- ing System, July 1994. The program is based on Alan Shepard and Donald K. Slayton, Moon Shot: The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon (Atlanta: Turner, 1994). 88 Wise interview. 89 Wise interview. 90 Wise interview. 9 Jones, Evaluation and Comparison, pp. 12, 83-95-</page><page sequence="27">Apollo-Era Space Suits 229 feat had been accomplished. Many, including Con- gress, thought that the money-more than $16 bil- lion for the Apollo project through 1969-could be better spent elsewhere. Apollo 17, in 1972, was the final manned lunar landing, Apollos 18, 19, and 2o having fallen to budget cuts.92 Their horizons shifted by changing national priorities, space agency managers moved spare Apollo hardware into project Skylab (NASA's facil- ity for studying long-term living in space, 1973- 74) and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (a 1975 or- bital linkup with the Soviets that demonstrated detente in space). For the small corner of the NASA inventory that space suits occupied, the end of Apollo meant the end of lunar EVA suits but the beginning of further refinements in free-space EVA equipment for the Space Shuttle program, which was approved in 1972. Apollo-Soyuz and Skylab used essentially the same ILC suits as the final Apollo missions, with small variations. After those projects, ILC continued as a NASA contrac- tor and today makes the suits for Space Shuttle EVAs. The Case Study in Context This artifact analysis has attempted to explain both the material aspects of space suits and something of the cultural atmosphere that determined their development. A focused case study like this-at the level of artifacts, designers, makers, and us- ers-illustrates the contingency of technical enter- prises like space suit making.93 This small-scale in- vestigation makes it clear that people are in charge of technology, that they conceive it, introduce it, modify it, and control it. Accordingly, one school of thought in the his- tory of technology holds that technology is socially constructed, that different groups with a stake in the final shape of an object, plan, or organization negotiate its structure and come to some finality reflected in the visible product. This view also sees social construction happening in "systems" of arti- facts and organizations or broader "actor net- works," including natural phenomena as deter- miners of technology.94 Certainly spaceflight technology, viewed from ground level, fits the social construction scheme. In space suits, we see designers, makers, and users contributing to the character of the artifact by in- teracting with one another to arrive at an accept- able product, limited in part by consideration of a natural environment. What is clear in this process is that people, not technologies, are the driving force of change and creation at every stage, at least in this small corner of the space program. But while people are the principal force, they are not the only force. It is reasonable here to ac- knowledge that technology "is not neutral or value free; it does have a character of its own. It makes demands upon those who would use it and trans- mits values to those who embrace it." Although it obviously has no consciousness or will, the technol- ogy at hand does seem to impose itself on people: To perform his job, the astronaut had to master the suit's controls and submit to its limitations, the engineers had to work within the context of the spacecraft and the materials and knowledge avail- able for designing suits, and the fabricators had to build within strict tolerances also dictated by mate- rials and knowledge. In this way, technology is "de- terministic in the sense of influencing users to do things they would not have to do if technology did not exist."95 Assigning to technology this type of agency in history is a "soft" determinism that mediates be- tween two conceptual poles: first, the notion that we have perfect freedom of choice and complete control over all things technological, which are pas- sive and neutral in our hands; and the other ex- treme, wherein technology is deemed a prime and 92 Launius, Apollo.

The latter strain, "hard" technological determinism, has of- ten been used in criticizing the ill effects of tech- nology on society, for showing what technology does to culture."6 But when the large scale is bro- ken down and examined on the level of creator and user, it becomes clear that whatever agency technology appears to have is really a situation ini- tiated by people, who then find their choices for action narrowed by what they or others have done or created. The culture-technology relationship is reciprocal but initiated and managed by humans, sometimes to benefit, sometimes not. The middle ground between technology's seeming indepen- dence and culture's demonstrable control is the soft determinism that allows us to see the same phenomena in two lights. Technology in the Apollo program, at least as far as space suits are concerned, was a two-way street. While materials, mission requirements, and design acted on people by limiting what could be done, people also shaped technology by determin- ing its form, influencing its evolution, and gener- ally imparting their human requirements and de- sires to the final product. As much as hardware set the parameters of the creators' activity, human characteristics and choices defined the technol- ogy's shape within those limits. This shape was fur- ther determined by Apollo's political compression into a decade, also a function of human choice.97 The creators of space suits--engineers, build- ers, and astronauts--shared in shaping the direc- tion of space suit development, if not its political circumstances. They also shared in infusing their values in their products. Faced with a deadline that expressed the ideological imperatives of the cold war, namely beating the Russians and asserting American technological and cultural preeminence, those charged with actually achieving these things took a pragmatic approach. They did not think first about the Soviets but rather focused on values of functional design, quality, prideful construc- tion, and reliable tools to use on the job. Designed as part of a technology to free people from the bonds of Earth-an old and fond dream-space suits are products of a culture that values questioning and exploration. To conceive of, build, and use such devices, the people involved had to be more than normally aware of what it meant to leave the planet and motivated enough to make it feasible through their creations. The final value of Apollo-era space suits is as records of human artifice and reflections of a will- ful technical culture. They show what people in a given historical context were able to create, and they help explain how a large technological system was built by individuals with local, personal mo- tives and diverse skills. In this way, culture and technology can be traced through artifacts to peo- ple, helping us to understand both. 96 The determinist critique of technology is summed up well in Lewis Mumford, "Authoritarian and Democratic Tech- nics," Technology and Culture 5, no. 1 (Winter 1964): 1-8; see also Lewis Mumford, Technics and Civilization (New York: Har- court Brace, 1934). The classic determinist expression is Jacques Ellul, The Technological Society, trans. John Wilkinson (New York: Knopf, 1964). 97 The political reasons for and nature of the space race are discussed thoroughly in Walter McDougall, Heavens and the Earth; Logsdon, Decision to Go to the Moon.
