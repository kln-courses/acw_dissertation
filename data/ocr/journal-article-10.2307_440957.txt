<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY AIKEN, CONRAD Wilbur, Robert Hunter, "The Song of Consciousness: Conrad Aiken's Poetry," Northwest Review, 2:49-54, Spring, 1959. Sheepfold Hill, Aiken's latest collection of poems, re-examines man's consciousness. No longer is Aiken an "apostle of disil- lusionment"; "accepting the naturalistic view of man," he now speaks affirmatively of a possible future. (E.T.) AMERICAN LITERATURE Lash John S., "Dimension in Racial Ex- perience: A Critical Summary of Liter- ature by and about Negroes in 1958." Phylon Quarterly, 20:115-31, Second Quarter, 1959. Writers of fiction about the Negro in 1948 were preoccupied with subsistence in the ghetto and the color line; "in those works which are concerned with the internal structure and ethnocentric demo- graphy of Negro culture there is some evidence of a probing in depth for pri- niordial causes and unadorned effects of these causes." (W.G.F.) ANDERSON, SHERWOOD Ringe, Donald A., "Point of View and theme in 'I Want to Know Why'," Critique; Studies in Modern Fiction, 3:24-9, Spring-Fall 1959. The skillful use of the first person point of view in "I Want to Know Why" allows Anderson to suggest the immature judg- ments and the sensuous response to the world arotund him of the young narrator. After his disillusionment, the boy is a step nearer maturity, but the point of view '(demands that Ihe boy not yet know the answer to his question"--though the careful reader will conclude that the narrator will answer it correctly. (G.O.) AIIDEN, WYSTAN HUGH Sunesen, Bent, "'All We Are Not Stares Back at What We Are': A Note on Auden," English Studies, 40:429-49, December, 1959. Auden'iThe Sea and the Mirror exhibits "the manifested power of seriousness that has ftused its content with its form." A knowledge of the poem "could become the basis of a reliable evaluation of Auden's art." (C.K.L.) BAHR, HERMANN Daviau, Donald G., "Dialog vom Marsyass Hermann Bahr's Affirmation of Life over Art," Modern Language Quar- terly, 20:360-70, December, 1959. Dialog vom Marsyas (1905) , stating Bahr's "decision to subordinate art of life," marks a shift of political, social, and, later, religious subject matter. Later works, showing no aesthetic development and a consistent self-limitation, place Bahr as a significant journalist rather than as an artist. (G.S.) BORCHERT, WOLFGANG Mileck, Joseph, "Wolfgang Borchert: 'Draussen vor der Tiir'," Monatshefte, 51:328-36, December, 1959. Borchert's hero, back from war, finds only indifference in the society to which he returns. But his own indulgence in self-pity an self-righteousness differs from society's only in degr-ee. Borchert, in this climactic story, assesses himself, society, and life, and thereafter gradually reconciles himself to his lot. (R.H.L.) BOWLES, PAUL Evans, Oliver, "Paul Bowles and the 'Natural' Man," Critiques Studies in Modern Fiction, 3:3-59, Spring-Fall 1959. An analysis of Bowles, three novels and numerous short stories reveals the author's "favorite formula, the defeat and degradation (whether moral or physical or both) of a civilized traveler in a prim- itive society." Bowles evidently believes in the superiority of "natural" man, that "as societies evolve technologically its members become more neurotic and un- happy." (G.O.) CALLAGHAN, MORLEY Watt, F. W., "Morley Calaghan as Think- er," Dalhousie Review, 319:305-13, Autumn, 1959. An examination of Callaghan's fiction, from the late twenties into the forties, reveals that much of his strength springs from his attempt to explore human ex- periences in terms of the intellectual con- cepts of the time. (R.K.) CAMUS, ALBERT Scott, Nathan, "The Modest Optimism of 36</page><page sequence="2">Albert Camus," ChIristian Scholar, 44: 251-74, Winter, 1959. After an exatmination of th1 Camnus canton, the author concludes that there is, especially in his later work, a "profound sense of the 'transpersonal presence of the divine' wliich is later an clemenit of bliblical faith, and we have: . . . ample testimony in his writings that. this is for him a rich and deep source of the con- fidence and the courage that enable himt to go beyond nihilism'." (G.O.) Sidergiird, Osten, "Unt aspect de la prose de Camus: le rythme tcrnairc," Studia Neophilologica, 31: 128-48, Number One, 1959. A noticeable stylistic mainerisni ill Camus' novels, plays, essays and trans- lations is the use of syntactical elements grouped in threes. Such triads of words, phrases, or clauses contribute to the strength and balance of his prose style. (F.j.P.) (ARY, JOYCE Adams, Hazard, "Blake and Gulley Jim- son: English Symbolists," Critique: Studies in Modern Fiction, 3:3-14, Spring-Fall 1959. A comparison of Blake's and Gulley Jim- son's careers, art, and aesthetic theorics reveals that in The Hforsc's Mouth Cary "expresses the position of the twentietlh- century artist who works consciously ill the tradition of English symbolism." Cary "is not (;ulley, buit he sides withl the artist's vision; and that artist turns outt to be a symbolist in the tradition of Blake." (G.O.) Adams, Hazard, "Joyce Cary: Posthumous Volumes and Criticism to Date," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 1:289-99, Summer, 1959. "Cary's novels are philosopical novels concerned with traditional philosophical problems which literature has always known . . . the reviewers of Cary are not as a rule distinguished by acute critical judgment . . . the Times Literary Review [has] the most mistaken or at least be- fuddled view of Cary's novels to date." (W.G.F.) Adams, Hazard, "Joyce Cary's Three Speakers," Modern Fiction Studies, 5:108-20, Summer, 1959. Whereas Woolf and Joyce attempted in their nmost amlbitious works "to explore the minds of their characters below the level of statement," Cary iI Firist Trilogy "chose to explore what tile minds of his characters cani articulatc, hiow conscious they arc of their own self-rcvclations, how carefutll they are in trying to sulppress what they think they have not revealed." Bothl methods suggest that the problemll of our age is "isolation of mind." (w.G.F.)

C(HEKOV, .ANTON Winner, Thomas G., "Clhexov's Ward No. 6 and Tolstoyan Ethics," Slavric and East European Journal, 17:321-34, Winter, 1959. Chekov was apparently attracted during the 1880's to Tolstoy's doctrine of non- resistance to evil, but after his trip to the Sakhalin l enal colony in 1890, he gradually turned against Tolstoy and directly attacked his idcas in HWard No. 6 a tragic-comedy oft a man driven insane by his own overly critical intellect.

"The 'lyric obsession with matter' in the form of trurs, spectacle, and the virtual olbliteration of text was, with the futur- ists, directed toward an essentially poli- tical ideal of automation; in France, on the other hand, it eventually served as a liberative influence which, if taken cum grano, helped renew a classical tradition." (A.S.) Kretsch, Robert W., "Political Passion in Balzac and Henry James," Nineteenth- Century Fiction, 14:265-70, December, 1959. Balzac and James attempted to repre- sent re-unification of personality in the fragmenting nineteenth century. In the Hiistorie des Treize Balzac conceived a group of characters who shared each other's passions. In The Princess Casa- massima James presented a revolutionary conspiracy under a strong leader. (F.C.T.) CONNELLY, MARC Ford, Nick Aaron, "How Genuine is The 37</page><page sequence="3">Green Pastures?," Phylon Quarterly, 20:67-70, First Quarter, 1959. Connelly utterly failed "to present a geduine representation of the religious beliefs of thousands of untutored Negroes in the deep South," a representation such as may be found in James Weldon John- son's "God's Trombones." (W.G.F.) Garey, Doris B., "The Green Pastures Again," Phylon Quarterly, 20:193-4, Second Quarter, 1959. The Green Pastures may be, as Ford [see above] maintains, objectionable on sociological grounds, but such criticism overlooks the most important element in ?he play: "its portrayal of the 'growth' of God." (W.G.F.) CONRAD, JOSEPH Stallman, R. W., "Time and The Secret Agent," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 1:101-22, Spring, 1959. "'Verloc's mission, in the intended bomb- ing of Greenwich observatory, is to destory Time-Now, Universal Time, or life itself. ..[the] mission is the destruc- tion of space and time, or the great circle of Greenwich meridian, the zero from which space is measured and time is clocked." (W.G.F.) COZZENS, JAMES GOULD Ludwig, Richard M., "James Gould Coz- zens: A Review of Research and Crit- icism," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 1:123-36, Spring, 1959. [Evaluates the welter of discussion of the previously neglected Cozzens that appear- ed after the publication of By Love Possessed.] (W.G.F.) CRANE, STEPHEN Beebe,, Maurice, and Gullason, Thomas A., "Criticism of Stephen Crane: A Selected Checklist with an Index to Studies of Separate Works," Modern Fiction Studies, 5:282-91, Autumn, 1959. Buitenhaus, Peter, "The Essentials of Life: 'The Open Boat' as Existentialist Fiction," Modern Fiction_. Studies, 5:243-50, Autumn, 1959. "The Open Boat" is not a naturalistic story since the protagonist transcends the limits of natural philosophy and makes an existential affirmation. "No story of Crane more profoundly embodies within its structure, style, and symbolism the meaning of experience," Crane's protag- onist is brought to the realization of the absurity of the experience and thence to a realziation of the human condition. (D.E.W.) Colvert, James B., "Structure and Theme in Stephen Crane's Fiction," Modern Fiction Studies, 5:199-208, Autumn, 1959. "The narrative design of Crane's best fiction is defined by the tension between two ironically divergent points of view: the narrowing and deluding point of view of the actors and the enlarging and ruth- lessly revealing point of view of the ob- server-narrator." More than being just a technical expediency, this use of point of view grows from his vision of the world and, at tht same time projects Crane's essential theme: " . the consequence of false pride, vanity, and blinding de- lusion." (D.E.W.) Cox, James Trammell, "The Imagery of The Red Badge of Courage," Modern Fiction Studies, 5:209-19, Autumn, 1959. A full understanding of Crane's better works demands an understanding of how Crane uses language poetically. The dis- covery, by Henry Fleming of the "nature of reality" is symbolically presented to the reader through the imagery, provid- ing this discovery with a ". . . pervasive dramatic irony which is essential to a full appreciation of the novel." (D.E.W.) Gleckner, Robert F., "Stephen Crane and the Wonder of Man's Conceit," Modern Fiction Studies, 5:271-81, Autumn, 1959. In "The Blue Hotel," man approaches a tragic stature. The over-all structure of the story is more carefully worked out than in any other Crane Story. Each level of life seems to control itself, but there is always an unrecognizable higher level exerting the real control. It is this force that defeats man's will. (D.E.W.) Gullason, Thomas A., "The Significance of Wounds in the Rain", Modern Fic- tion Studies, 5:235-42, Autumn, 1959. Wounds in the Rain shows that Crane's craftsmanship did not fail or weaken in the last years of his life. In these stories, one finds a more mature, realistic writer than the more romantic writre of The Red Badge of Courage. His exposure to real war gave him greater depth, a 38</page><page sequence="4">a less obtrusive style, and a mellow worldliness (D.E.W.) Maclean, Hugh N., "The Two Worlds of 'The Blue Hotel'," Modern Fiction Studies, 5:260-70, Autumn, 1959. In "The Blue Hotel" Crane is making a case for the will and also deprecating reason. The contrast is central to the story; the blue hotel is the isolated world of "what might be," and the saloon re- presents the world of "what is" The first means something; the second, nothing. (D.E.W.) Solomon, Eric, "The Structure of The Red Badge of Courage," Modern Fiction Studies, 5:220-34, Autumn, 1959. It was Stephen Crane who gave the war novel its classic form, for he was creating rather than re-living an experience. The Red Badge deals with both Henry Flem- ing's awakening to a knowledge of his real self and a parallel awakening on the part of his regiment. At the conclusion of the novel, Henry has become a new man who views life in a fresh frame- work, armed not towards glory but a jobl to be done. (D.E.W.) Stallman, R. W., "Crane's 'Maggie': A Reassessment," Modern Fiction Studies, 5:251-9, Autunmn, 1959. "Maggie" is an art novel, not a sociol- ogical period piece. The novel is episodic, and the nineteen episodic chapters are related by moods of romantic sentiment, illusion, or hope contrasted with contra- dictory moods of futility, disillusionment, or despair. "The ironic viewpoint from which Crane designs his forthright moral and social intent" is what saves this novel from becoming an outdated sociological novel. (D.E.W.) CRITICISM Cruttwell, Patrick, "Makers and Persons," Hudson Review, 12:487-507, Winter, 1959-60. Only in the case of drama, perhaps, can one completely separate author-as-maker and author-as-person. Despite the prac- tice of the New Critics, one cannot isolate literary responses from all other re- sponses. Unfortunately, it is impossible to set practicable limits of useful bio- graphical and historical knowledge. (M.H.) Foster, Richard, "R. P. Blackmur: The Technical Critic as Romantic Agonist," Western Review, 23:259-70, Spring, 1959. "One may complain of Blackmur's diffi- culty and at times feel imposed upon and embarrassed by the style." But there is so much of value, in the later work especially that "he may justly be regarded as one of the most sensitive and subtle critics of our time." (C.K.L.) Lecky, Eleazer, "Ideas of Order in Modern Literary Criticism," Literature and Psychology, 9:36-9, Summer and Fall, 1959. The concept of "order" as an absolute value for literary criticism fails to take into account the ultimate relativity of order. To call experience "disorder" and art "order" is to oversimplify the rela- tionship of art to "order". (R.A.B.) Wakeman, Mary K., "Dynamics of the Tragic Catharsis," Literature and Psy- chology 9:34-41, Summer and Fall, 1959. "Tragedy is a traumatic experience de- livered bound. A free-flowing cathexis has been transformed into usefully avail- able energy. We are exhilarated by a feeling of power, of vitality to spare, and of the satisfaction that cames only with personal achievement." (R.A.B.) DRAMA Gassner, John, "The Source, The Path, The Vision: A Relativistic View," Edu- cational Theatre Journal, 11:259-64, December, 1959. In creative theater, "hazard and indi- vidual talent are all, and . . . everything else is chaff in the creative process and chatter in the academic world-and that includes esthetics . . ." (B.K.) Groff, Edward, "Point of View in Modern Drama," Modern Drama, 2:268-82, December, 1959. In striving to create dramatic forms which will allow greater psychological subtlety and depth, modern dramatists have experimented with the exploration of the minds of characters in theatrical terms. As a result, many of the most exciting dramatic experiments will emerge from the use of the point of view of the 'consciousness of an engaged narrator." (C.K.L.) 39</page><page sequence="5">Hodge, Francis, "'The Director as Critic," Educational Theatre jour nai, 11-280-4, Deccmler r, 1959. T'he director, "the t wcniteth-centur 's most important stage critic," mutist con- stait ly cxercise his obljective, analytical critcial view in order to control his media. Although his function is largely one of interprctation, the director also is truly creative. (B.K.) loncsco, Eugene, "kA Discussion on the Avant-Garde 'Theatre," World Theatre, 8:171-202, Autumn, 1959. Delining the avant-garde in terms of op- position and rupture," lonesco describes its true representative as "a critic of, and not an apologist for, what exists now." Such theatre should be a laboratory pro- viding "the same opportunities as scien- tists' for making experiments" for its playwrights. (S.G.L.) Rosenberg, Harold,, "Notes on Identity," Tulane Drama Review, 4:27-35, lDe- cember, 1959. "The central intuition of tragedy, as of psychoanalysis, is that there is one unique fact which each individual anx- iously struggles to conceal from himself, and this is the very fact that is the root of identity." (S.G.L.) DRAMl.\ (ANIERICAN) Gorelik, Moredcai, "Toward a Larger Theatre," Contact, 2:47-56, 1959. What is wrong with modern American theatre is "not the theme liut its failure to open up ultimate causes." Epic pro- duction, as exemplified by the work of Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator, sees beyond domestic problems or individual psychology and is "leading the way toward a larger theatre." (C.K.L.) Hewes, Henry, "Young Dramatists on Trial in the United States," World Theatre, 8:217-24, Autumn, 1959. None of the newest playwrights show promises of reaching the stature of Miller and Williams. Unfortunately, their pre- dominantly "slice of life" drama is cur- rently conditioned on Broadway by "cer- tain knacks" for serving box office. They are encouraged "to suggest rather than explore themes." (S.G.L.) Highlander, James L., "America's First Art Theatre: The New Theatre of Chlicago," Educational Theatre Journal, 11:285-90, )ecemnber, 1959. For several months, in 1905-6, Chicago and America, in the New Theatre, pos- sessed an art theatre." Wheras the contin- ental forerunners of the New Theatre produced and promoted the "new drama," this theatre almost completely overlooked it. Begun with zealous artistic ambitions, it ended in bickering and coin- fusion. (B.K.) Weissman, Philip, "A Lively Theater of Lives: Portraitures Versus Art," Mod- ern Drama, 2:263-7, December 1959. The dramatiziations of the lives of con- temporaries are not automatically useless for the stage; however, these plays do not add to "the stature of tlhe American theater." IHas "psychological curiosity about our own times and our contemp- oraries . .. overshadowed the aesthetic search for the inner nature of contempor- ary man?" (C.K.L.) DRAMA (CANADIAN) Cohen, Nathan, "Theatre Today: English Canada," Tamarack Review, 13:24-37, Autumn, 1959. 'Ihe Stratford miracle, which in reality has proved to be a blight, interrupted the steady dcvelopment of the Canadian theatrc. Financially, the theatre stands on very shaky feet. (D.E.W.) tiamcline, Jean, "l'heatre Today: French Canada," 'amarahk Reviewul, 13:38-47, Autumn, 1959. 'The rnolern French-Canadian theatre, strongly influenced by French and Ameri- can drama, is the result of twenty years of ceaseless effort. The final result of its success will probably be an authentic French-Canadian drama in the future. (D.E.W.) DRAMA (FRENCH) Davril, R., "Elizabethan Drama and Modern French Theater," Texas Quar- terly, 2:94-105, Winter, 1959. In the hands of certain stage directors, the Elizabethan drama proved an in- valuable instrument for the invigoration of the modern French drama and for the destruction of French "classical" tenets that still, despite the romantic revolt, provided dramntic criteria at the con- clusion of the nineteenth century. (M.H.) Pronko, 1.eonard C., "Sunshine and Sub- stances: The Comic Theater of Achard, 40</page><page sequence="6">Anouilh, Ayme, Roussin," Modern Drama, 2:243-50, December 1959. There are some radical differences in the works of Archard, Anouilh, Ayme, and Roussin, which make some of these dramatists more palatable to American audiences than others. However, "the modern French theatre, in both its serious and its light moods, has a great deal to offer to an American audience." (C.I.L.) DRAMA (IRISH) Fitz-Simon, Christopher, "The Theater in Dublin," Modern Drama, 2:289-94, December, 1959. A review of the Dublin theatre reveals that "productions of artistic importance ... are no rare occurences." (C.K.L.) DRAMA (SPANISH) Arjona, Doris K., "The Spanish Theatre of Today," Educational Theatre Jour- nal, 11:265-70, December, 1959. The current Spanish theater seems una- ware of today's political and social prob- lems. Its vitality derives, as it always has, from its perennial interest in individual human beings. [The work of leading twentieth-century Spanish playwrights is characterized.] (B.K.) DREISER, THEODORE Handy, William J., "A Re-Examination of Dreiser's Sister Carrie," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 1:380-93, Autumn, 1959. A shift from accepted critical preoccupa- tions is necessary to discover the distinc- tive power of Dreiser's work; when we approach Sister Carrie with the intention of discovering its particular value, "the most immediate impression is that of the looming presence of Dreiser throughout the work." (W.G.F.) EBERHART, RICHARD Thorslev, Peter L., Jr., "The Poetry of Richard Eberhart," Northwestern Uni- versity Tri-Quarterly, 2:26-32, Winter, 1959-60. Eberhart is a romantic, a poet of nature and of personal human values. His best work lies between two extremes, the prosaic and the pyrotecthnical. His quiet controlled lyrics are his truest work. (E.T.) ELIOT, THOMAS STEARNS Austin, Allen, "T. S. Eliot's Objective Correlative", University of Kansas City Review, 26:133-40, December, 1959. Through the term "objective correlative", which he introduced in his 1919 essay on Hamlet, Eliot stresses the importance of a motive for the character's emotion. The term signifies "a complex of situation and images which both causes and ex- presses the character's emotion." (G.K.) Bollier, E. P., "T. S. Eliot and John Mil- ton: A Problem in Criticism," Tulane Studies in English, 8:165-92, 1958. Eliot's strictures on Milton must be con- sidered against the background of Eliot's general theory of poetic craftsmanship and tradition. "As Eliot's concern with the contemporary 'revolution of the word' has lessened his conception of poetry has broadened to include such poets who like Milton have elaborated within an established convention." (W.G.F). Hovey, Richard B., "Psychiatrist and Saint in The Cocktail Party," Litera- ature and Psychology, 9:51-5, Summer and Fall, 1959. Eliot's inadequate undertsanding of "dy- namic depth psychology" and his ap- parent inability to present an argument for "mature love" point up "a limitation of his insight into Christianity." (R.A.B.) FAULKNER, WILLIAM Cfonnolly, Thomas E., "Faulkner's A Fable in the Classroom," College Eng- lish, 21:165-71, December 1959. A character outline (giving page and action), such as the one given here, helps students to understand the structure of a novel and to discuss the novel. (M.J.O.) Eby, Cecil D., "Faulkner and the South- western Humorists," Shenandoah, 11: 13-21, Autumn, 1959. "None of his work is more Southern than The Hamlet, but its South is the less familiar wasteland of the early regional- ists [Johnson Hooper, Joseph Glover Baldwin] rather than the well-known plantation settings of the romantic novel- ist [Augusta Evans Wilson]." (J.N.P.) Garrett, George, "Faulkner's Early Liter- ary Criticism," Texas Studies in Liter- ature and Language, 1:3-10, Spring, 1959. 41</page><page sequence="7">The reviews that Faulkner wrote in 1921 and 1922 for the undergraduate news- paper, the Missississippian, show that he was not as provincial as critics have often assumed but was well aware of the con- temporary literary and theatrical situa- tion and that even this early he em- phasized the need for artifice to distin- guish art from life. (W.G.F.) Wasiolek, Edward, "As I Lay Dying: Dis- tortion in the Slow Eddy of Current Opinion," Critique: Studies in Modern Fiction, 3:15-23, Spring-Fall 1959. An attack on the traditional view of As I Lay Dying as being concerned with the "serious, dignified, and even heroic struggle of poor whites to define their sense of kinsship." Here the novel is read as bitterly ironic, and the promise that Addie exacts from her family is interpreted as her method of revenge, her way of exposing what she has learned about life: "that men are forever strangers to each other, that the bonds of kinship, love, trust, and even fear and sin are but words." (G.O.) FICTION Arden, Eugene, "The Early Harlem Novel," Phylon Quarterly, 20:25-31, First Quarter, 1958. The novels written about Harlem since the appearance of Paul L. Dunbar's naturalistic The Sport of the Gods (1902) have added a new character to American fiction, an urban Negro, "more pliable, less likely to fit into stock cate- gories than any of the earlier Negro characters." (W.G.F.) Couthland, G. R., "The West Indian Novel and Immigration," Phylon Quarterly, 20:32-41, First Quarter, 1959. Recent novels about West Indian emi- grants to the United States and Europe all emphasize that the migrants are tem- peramentally out of place in their new environments and generally advocate that the migrants should cling to their own values and preserve separate cultural identities. (W.G.F.) Gaster, Beryl, "The Novel in France Today," Contemporary Review, No- vember, 1959, pp. 237-9. The novel is in process of evolution in France, where it has been influenced strongly by Proust, Joyce, Faulkner, and Kafka. There is an ascetic, meager, austere approach. Most of the novelists subscribe to the premise that all is false- the social order, liberty, justice, etc. Upon this premise they build a world where true knowlege is impossible and where alienation is the common curse. (F.L.) Hassan, Ihab H., "The Victim: Images o of Evil in Recent American Fiction," College English, 21:140-6, December 1959. "When one considers the examples of re- cent American fiction, considers the oc- casion of outrage and despair, the objects of ultimate revulsion, the experiences of violence and terror, one finds that the victim appears through all, a crooked testimonial to the power of evil, and a testimonial also to the greater power of rebirth." (M.J.O.) Lehar, Richard, "Existentialism in Re- cent American Fiction: The Demonic Quest," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 1:181-202, Summer, 1959. American writers like Paul Bowles, Saul Bellow and Ralph Ellison are preoc- cupied with the same problems and themes that puzzle Sartre and Camus: "the meaning of identity in the modern world, the nature of- good and evil, the possibility of fulfillment in the contem- porary society, the source of values in a world without God, and the possibility and meaning of action in an ethical vacuum." (W.G.F.) Robbe-Grillet, Alain, "Old 'Values' and the New Novel," Evergreen Review, 3:98-118, Summer, 1959. The new novel must deal only with sur- faces and not pretend to a penetration of the "inside" of things, since if man is logically to assert personal freedom, he must reject anthropomorphism. He must refuse "any idea of pre-established order." (W.G.F.) FITZGERALD, F. SCOTT Kuehl, John, "Scott Fitzgerald: Romantic and Realist," Texas Studies in Litera- ture and Language, 1:412-26, Autumn 1959. Fitzgerald's best fiction combines ele- ments of the novel of manners and the romance; The Great Gatsby most suc- cesfully blends a realistic treatment of our culture with the age-old "hero myth." (W.F.G.) 42</page><page sequence="8">FORSTER, EDWARD MORGAN Crews, Frederick P., "The Longest Journey and the Perils of Humanism," ELH, 26:575-96, December, 1959. Forster's The Longest Journey celebrates "a combination of utter philosophical pessimism" and a recognition that art- which is a challenge "to create an order which rivals nature's order"--offers man perhaps his best hope. (R.A.B.) FROST, ROBERT Lasser, Michael I., "The Loneliness of Robert Frost," Literary Review, 2:287- 97, Winter 1959-60. Frost has "withdrawn into a lonely land- scape." There he creates the "isolated instant," placing his characters as lonely individuals in vast and sometimes bleak natural settings. He is really a poet of silence and retreat. (E.T.) GIDE, ANDRE Holdheim, William W., "The Dual Struc- ture of the Promethde mal enchaind," Modern Language Notes, 74:14-20, De- cember 1959. "The formal structure of the Promdthde gives symbolic expression to the old Gidian theory of artistic catharsis." But Gide manages to imply ironically that even the final harmony is false (M.J.O.) GIRAUDOUX, JEAN Hooker, Ward, "Giraudoux's Last Play," Hudson Review, 12:604-11, Winter, 1959-60. Despite prevailing French opinion about Giraudoux's posthumous plays, Pour Lucrdce represents the playwright at his best: it is "the most satisfactory" of his tragedies, better in setting and better in construction; Lucile is the most successful of his "essence" characters. (M.H.) GREENE, GRAHAM Wassmer, Thomas A., "The Sinners of Graham Greene," Dalhousie Review, 39:326-32, Auutmn, 1959. Many of the significant inversions in the characters and themes of Greene's work spring from paradoxes regarding the problem of sin (e.g. "God appears to be psychologically most present when theol- gically He is most remote") (R. K.) HALL, DONALD "Crunk," "The Work of Donald Hall," The Fifties, Third Issue, 1959, pp. 32-46. Donald Hall has until recently been a poet of the middle classes. Some of his latest work shows a changed viewpoint. The author concludes that poetry "must leave the middle class . . . and its ideas and securities," pointing to the work of Leslie Hedley, Ferlinghetti, and others. (E.T.) HEMINGWAY, ERNEST Freeman, Richard, "Hemingway's Span- ish Civil War Dispatches," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 1:170-80, Summer, 1959. Hemingway's dispatches to the North American Newspaper Alliance were written without bias and rarely reported material that he used in his passionately pro-Loyalist fiction; he could not use material for fiction once he had used it for feature writing because "once the emotion had been drained from it he could not bring himself to revivify it." (W.G.F.) Kinnamon, Kenneth, "Hemingway, the Corrida, and Spain," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 1:44-61, Spring, 1959. "Hemingway has so completely assimilat- ed certain aspects of the Spanish tem- perament that they have become-per- haps unconsciously on his part-a deter- mining factor in his conception of moral- ity . . . his theory of tragedy, and the characteristic type of his hero." (W.G.F.) Moynihan, William T., "The Martyrdom of Robert Jordan," College English, 21: 127-32, December 1959. "The plot of this novel is so constructed as to best depict a distinct type of human being, a man willing to die for a cause, and from this specific type of character stems the 'mighty theme" of "For Whom the Bell Tolls, the oneness of mankind." (M.J.O.) HEYM, GEORG Krispyn, E., "Sources and Subject Matter in Two Short Stories by Georg Heym," AUMLA, Journal of the Australasian Universities Language and Literature Association, 12:52-57, November, 1959. Heym's story "The Thief," in the way it draws upon two actual museum incidents as well as upon Mereschowski's biography of da Vinci, reveals the author's "ani- 43</page><page sequence="9">mistic approach to lifeless objects, and a preoccupation with mental abnormality." His story "The Fifth of October" reveals the author's historical fatalism. (F.J.P.) HOFMANNSTHAL, HUGO VON Mell, Max, "Hugo von Hofmannsthal," Die Neue Rundschau, 70:397-401, No. 3, 1959. There was something essentially tragic in the personality of Hofmannsthal, bound up with his remarkable ability to produce beauty even while his world was under- going war and upheaval. (R.H.L.) Schoolfield, George C., "Two Unpublish- ed Letters of Hugo von Hofmann- sthal," Monatshefte, 51:337-40, Decem- ber, 1959. In 1921 Hofmannsthal was invited to con- tribute a series of articles to Sydsvenska, Dagbladet Snallposten. He assented in a gracious letter to Claes Lindskog, ad- visory associate of SDS. Two articles were published In a second letter Hofmann- thal proposed an article on Schnitzler, which, however, was not published. (R.H.L.) Stern, Martin, "Hofmannsthals erstes Lustpielfragment," Die Neue Rund- schau, 70:463-98, No. 3, 1959. With the help of newly available manu- scripts, it is possible to interpret Hof- mannsthal's first fragmentary comedy, Silvia, in terms of his tradionally attri- buted development from unreality to reality. Silvia is an attempt, vitiated by complexity, to clothe profundity in the harmless garb of social superficiality. (R.H.L.) HOPKINS, GERARD MANLEY Mellown, Elgin, W., "Gerald Manley Hopkins and His Public, 1889-1918," Modern Philology, 56:94-9, November, 1959. It is questionable that Bridges's 1918 edi- tion of Hopkin's poems was solely re- sponsible for the success of that work. "Before the major date in the critical his- tory of Hopkins, it is clear that, on the basis of the appreciation of a few poems and a feeling of religious sympathy, he had achieved a limited following recep- tive and responsive to whatever might be published." (AS.) JAMES, HENRY Cargill, Oscar, "Gabriel Nash-Somewhat less than Angel?" Nineteenth Century Fiction, 14:231-9, December, 1959. Lyall Powers errs in believing that James intended The Tragic Muse as his vale- dictory novel and in identifying Gabriel Nash with James himself. Nash's two names (from the Elizabethan controver- sialists Harvey and Nash), the subject (the new aestheticism), and Nash's phil- osophy (being rather than doing) all suggest Wilde, not James. (F.C.T.) Flinn, H. G. and Howard C. Key, "Henry James and Gestation," College English, 21:173-75, December, 1959. It is possible that the misprint in the Portrait, referred to by James in a letter to Mrs. Linton, is Madame Merle's state- ment about the time of the birth of Isabel's child. (M.J.O.) JONES, JAMES Burress, Lee A., Jr., "James Jones on Folklore and Ballad," College English, 21:161-5, December 1959. James Jones writes in a letter replying to an inquiry about the ballad-writing scene in From Here to Eternity: "As you can see, the song and the episodes connected with it were purely. the result of an effort of technique in writing-an attempt, to get down, written, something about these men I knew and their music, and at the same time to do it in such a way as to strengthen the power and emotion of the novel as a whole, a sort of harmonic counterpoint to Prewitt's own story." (M.J.O.) JOYCE, JAMES Ryf, Robert S. "Joyce's Visual Imagina- tion," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 1:30-43, Spring, 1959. In Joyce's writing may be found "paral- lels for every technique employed in motion picture form" (including mon- tage, superimposition, the overlap dis- solve, filashback, controlled perspective, and pictorial ligthing) ; and though critics have dwelt usually on the auditory aspects of Joyce's work, he goes farther than his contemporaries in exploiting the same devices as the cinema. (W.G.F.) Sultan, Stanley, "The Sirens at the Ormond Bar: Ulysses", The University of Kansas City Review, 26:83-92, De- cember, 1959. Ulysses, rather than being a "chaos of arbitrary allusions, stylistic singularities, 44</page><page sequence="10">and unique devices", as is often claimed, has comprehensible form and structural integrity. The author supports this con- tention by a functional examination of Chapter 11, with particular reference to its analogues, Martha (von Flotow's opera) and The Odyssey. (G.K.) KAFKA, FRANZ Leopold, Keith, "Franz Kafka's Stories in the First Person," A UMLA, Journal of the Australasianz Universities Language kc Literature Association, 11:56-62, Sep- tember, 1959. Kafka sometimes "achieves a remarkable effect of presentness in the narration of past incidents" or at other times produces a type of story that "approaches the re- port rather than the narrative." Both techniques "suggest an outlook that sees life not as order, pattern and develop- ment, but rather as a series of isolated moments in which the individual is en- trapped, and these moments are further seen as precarious and infinitely com- plex." (F.J.P.) Spilka, Mark, "David Copperfield as Psy- chological Fiction," Critical Quarterly, 1:292-301, Winter, 1959. Spilka utilizes certain parallel features in Kafka's Amerika, "his Dickens novel',' in his analysis of David Copperfield as a "projective novel." (J.N.P.) Spilka, Mark, "Kafka and Dickens: The Country Sweetheart," American Imago, 16:367-78, Winter, 1959. Kafka has acknowledged his debt to Dickens' David Copperfield in the writ- ing of Amerika, but critics have been un- able to explain sufficiently "the country sweetheart" parallel. The aim here is "to account more fully and accurately for the troublesome parallel, and to demonstrate its relation to each writer's method." (J.M.D.) Webster, Peter Dow, "Franz Kafka's 'Metamorphosis' as Death and Resur- rection Fantasy," American Imago, 16: 349-65, Winter, 1959. The "initial conversion of the hero into the image of the dung beetle is followed by the inward discharge or abreaction of the castration fantasy, with progressive release of the oral and anal fixations or cathexes, until a fatal phallic libido is achieved, as symbolized by the three priapic gentlement, the restoration of the father and mother imnagos, and especially the nubility of the cmancipated anima, Grete." (J.M.D.) KRISHNAMURTI, .JIDDU Burden, Jean, "Krishnamurti and the Pathless Land," Prairie Schooner, 33: 271-80, Fall, 1959. K's second volume of commentaries are beautifully written, but will probably not become best-sellers. The short essays do not appeal to those who are looking for gratification rather than realization. (D.E.W.) LAWRENCE, DAVID HERBERT Hogan, Robert, "D. H. Lawrence and his Critics," Essays in Criticism, 9:381-7, 1959. An examination of three recent articles on Lawrence which appeared in Essays in Criticism leads the author to hazard that much Lawrence "criticism does him little serivce and is completely trivial and utterly unnecessary." Lawrence has become critically fashionable; his reputa- tion is likely to suffer because there are "too many workers in his vineyard." (G.O.) Porter, Katherine Anne, "A Wreath for thle Gamekeeper," Shenandoah, 11:3-12, Autumn, 1959. Critics have been carried away in their evaluation of Lady Chatterly's Lover by their feelings about censorship. Though obscenity can be literally effective, Law- rence abuses obscenity by making it sickly sentimental. The novel is labor- iously bad and has received far more attention than it deserves as literature. (D.E.W.) Widmer, Kingsley, "The Sacred Sun in Modern Literature," Humanist, 19: 368-72, November-December, 1959. Heterodox religious art, as in Lawrence and other literary rebels, is well seen in their revival of pagan sun-worship. Re- gardless of belief, their works maintain "crucial individualitsic values," which "are not adequately encompassed by our orthodox, rational, and practical" schem- atisms. Furthermare, the "revaluation" of such literary-religious heterodoxies provides an inadequately acknowledged cultural tradition of "felt thought." (K.W.) MACLEISH, ARCHIBALD MacLeisch, Andrew, "The Poet's Three Comforters: J. B. and the Critics," 45</page><page sequence="11">Modern Drama, 2:224-30, December, 1959. The pejorative criticism of latter-day critics sees J. B. as a misrepresentatioq of the book of Job and fails to recognize that the Book of Job provides a "sug- gestive framework for a modern and broadly universal statement." Rather, the play is "an illustration . . . of man's existence within the Christian tradi- tion .. ." (C.K.L) Montgomery, Marion, "On First Looking into Arichbald MacLeish's Play in Verse J. B.," Modern Drama, 2:231-42, December, 1959. While "MacLeish has demonstrated that he is aware of the technical complexities of play verse, . . . J. B. has the feeling, despite some interesting stage manipula- tions, of a humanistic sermon and a pep- talk." (C.K.L.) MALLOCK, WILLIAM HURRELL Yarker, P. M., "W. H. Mallock's Other Novels," Nineteenth-Century Fiction, 14:189-205, December, 1959. Although Mallock's The New Republic (1877) continued influential, his effort, continuing into the twentieth century, to deal with the significant themes of the religious crisis, love, and social reform and to solve technical problems of realism and the consciousness of char- acters failed to produce a satisfactory novel. (F.C.T.) MANN, HEINRICH Weisstein, Ulrich, "Die Arme Tonietta: Heinrich Mann's Triple Version of an Operatic Plot," Modern Language Quarterly, 20:371-7, December, 1959. The opera Die Arme Tonietta, character- ized by "sentimentalism iA la Puccini . . . blended with certain verismo elements," is a central and structural "play within a play" in the novel Die Kleine Stadt; a second version exists in manuscript out- line and the third is a Verga-like novella. (G.S.) MANN, THOMAS Hatfield, Henry, "Death in the Late Works of Thomas Mann," Germanic Review, 34:284-88, December, 1959. With Doktor Faustus, Mann's mood shifts sharply to nihilism and death. This vein continues in The Holy Sinners and The Deceived Woman. A definitive return to affirmation, however, is signaled by Mann's "Essay on Schiller." (R.H.L.) Loose, Gerhard, "Glocken tiber Rom," Modern Language Notes, 74:633-6, No- vember, 1959. The Kirchenglockenerzget6se that hails the newly chosen Pope in Thomas Mann's Der Erwidhlte finds-it antecedent more than thirty years earlier in a strong reaction to a musical effect in Hans Pfitz- ner's Palestrina, Musikalische Legende. (MJO) MENOTTI, GIAN-CARLO Lillich, Meredith, "Menotti's Music Dramas," Educational Theatre Journal, 11:271-9, December, 1959. Since The Medium, Menotti's success in welding libretto and music has produced a new form, neither opera nor drama. The whole is more than the sum of its parts, with almost all of Menotti's works being tremendously effective. (B.K.) MONTHERLANT, HENRI DE Norrish, P. J. "Montherlant's Conception of Tragic Hero," French Studies, 14: 18-37, January 1960. Although Montherlant's heroes lack com- passion and although their sufferings often seem more melodramatic than tragic, they celebrate some "much neg- lected virtue": integrity and "a sense of duty to one's principles' which is ex- pressed in a pure and forceful lan- guage "which heightens (heir nobility." (RA.B.) MORRIS, WRIGHT Carpenter, Frederic I., "Wright Morris and the Territory Ahead," College English, 21:147-56, December 1959. "His novels have all contributed to the traditional American myth of new dis- covery and self-realization, although his criticism consciously asserts that this myth is deluded and dangerous." (M.J.O.) O'NEILL, EUGENE Alexander, Doris M., "Eugene O'Neil, 'The Hound or Heavan,' and the 'Hell Hole'," Modern Language Quarterly, 20:307-14, DIcember, 1959. Servitude, Welded and Days Without End all "dramatize the 'Hound of Heavan' theme: that is, flight from love and ac- ceptance with an ultimate surrender into love and faith"; this parallelism shows thatDays Without End is non-Catholic and directly in O'Neill's line of develop- ment. (G.S.) 46</page><page sequence="12">OSBORNE, JOHN Dyson, A. E., "Look Back in Anger," Critical Quarterly, 1:318-26, Winter, 1959. "Look Back In Anger is a play which in- creases understanding both of the tor- mented and their torments," reminding "us what our rebel moralists are apt to be like, and of the strange mingling of sensitivity and cruelty, insight and wil- fulness, idealism and cynicism in their ,make-up that can make life terrible for those woh know them, and yet offer re- wards as well." (J.N.P.) PASTERNAK, BORIS Bowman, Herbert E., "Doctor Zhivago," Northwest Review, 2:59-67, Spring, 1959. The atmosphere of the novel is the atmosphere of poetry. Pasternak ap- proaches his story poetically, not fiction- ally. The method is lyrical and objec- tive; the images and metaphor are those of poetry. (E.T.) Grigorieff, Dmitry Felix, "Pasternak and Dostoevskij," Slavic and East Eu'ropean Journal, 17:335-42, Winter, 1959. Dostoevsky and Pasternak have related metaphysical ideas, significant to a com- pete appreciation of their art, about an eschatological upheaval in the coming of Christ, life as the Highest Essence sus- taining the created world, and the ethi- cally spiritless and esthetically trivial ap- proach to life of modern humanistic civil- ization (W.G.F.). Vickery, Walter, "Symbolism Aside, Doktor Zhivago," Slavic and East Euro- pean Journal, 17:343-8, Winter, 1959. The principal impact of Doctor Zhivago, and its claim to greatness derive not from its more abstruse and esoteric aspects, but from the doings, personalities, lives, and fates of the main characters." (W.G.F.) POETRY Beum, Robert, "The Center of the Poem," Prairie Schooner, 33:269-70, Fall, 1959. Eckman classifies the poems of Cobras and Cockle Shells, by "Americans under forty whose work has had magazine and book publication during the last decade," in terms of stylistic modes he calls decora- ative, substantive, and kinetic. The analyses of the poems get both critic and poet back to fundamentals. Eckman be- lieves that the best American poetry is being written in the kinetic mode. (D.E.W.) Bly, Robert, "Some thoughts on Lorca and Rene Char," The Fifties, Third Issue, 1959, pp. 7-9. The poetry of France, Spain and South America has passed through surrealism. North American poetry has not; there- fore, the poetry of the United States, ex- cept for formal patterns, is almost in- distinguishable from that of twenty years ago. (E.T.) "Kaleidoscope of U. S. Poetry," Life, 48:66-75, February 15, 1960. [Color photographs by Gordon Parks con- veying the themes of his own favorite selections from modern American poetry.] POUND, EZRA Merchant, W. Moelwyn, "Ezra Pound," Critical Quarterly, 1:277-87, Winter, 1959. . Pound's work has the fullest inte- grity: wholeness, unity; and its proceeds from passionate conviction . . . his fail- ures of obscruity, or of blurring violence in public statement, are to be related to his work as a whole .. ." (J.N.P.) SASSOON, SIEGFRIED Cohen, Joseph, "The Three Roles of Siegfried Sassoon," Tulane Studies in English, 7:169-85, 1957. About 1940 Sassoon amalgamated the two roles he had been playing, those of angry prophet and country gentleman, into that of a self-effacing hermit, celebrating the disappearance of an order better than the one that replaced it (W. G. F.) SHAW, GEORGE BERNARD Dickson, Ronald J., "The Diabolonian Character in Shaw", University of Kansas City Review. 26:145-51, De- cember, 1959. The Diabolonian figure in Shaw (chiefly Dick Dudgeon, Tanner and Undershaft) is a realist, 'an enemy of the false gods of society, a revolutionary, and yet a highly moral man," a virtuous Mephistopheles opposed to an iniquitous society. Shaw's audience must reverse its "conventional attitudes towards both the devil and society." (G.K.) Hummert, Paul A., "Bernard Shaw's Marxist Utopias," Shaw Review, 2:7-26, September, 1959. 47</page><page sequence="13">An analysis of Back to Methuselah, The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles, and Farfetched Fables "will show Karl Marx's brand of socialism to be the real com- panion of Creative Evolution and hence that these two doctrines . ... hold the secret to a thorough understanding of Bernard Shaw's vision of the future." (C.K.L.) Nickson, Richard, "The World Betterer: Shaw versus- Shaw," Shaw Review, 2:29-44, September, 1959. "The World Betterer," Act I of Buoyant Billions: A Comedy of No Manners (1947), "reveals not only many of Shaw's own firnn beliefs, but some of his nagging doubts as well." (C.K.L.) Weintraub, Stanley, "The Embryo Play- wright in Bernard Shaw's Early Novels," Texas Studies in Literature and Lan- guage, 1:327-55, "Shaw, the playwright, could never di- vorce himself form Shaw, the novelist." Ideas and even techniques he used in his novels recur in his plays, and his ideas for plays "often overflowed the form requiring fictional appendages. (W.G.F.) SINCLAIR, UPTON Becker, George J., "Upton Sinclair: Quix- ote in a Flivver," College English, 21: 133-40, December 1959. Upton Sinclair is a good storyteller, seri- ous, prolific, and persistent; yet his effect has been weakened by his simplification of social and economic ideas and of char- acter. His wirting is most effective when it is a "close, documented study of the working of some specific economic mechanism." (M.J.O.) STYLE Hill, Archibald A., "Principles Govern- ing Semantic Parallels,' Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 1:356-65, Autumn, 1959. "No single item of figurative language, no matter how strikingly picturesque, can be assured to contain a parallel . .. all parallels break cdown sooner or later, and the only measure of their closeness is how long they maintain themselves be- fore likerness is exhausted." (W.G.F.) TATE, ALLEN Blum, Margaret Morton, "Alltten Tate's 'Mr. Pope': A Reading," Modern Lan- gua?e Notes, 74:706-08, Decemtern 1959. "The title poem of [Mr. Pope and Other Poems] was Mr. Tate's effort to aid in the restablishment to popular esteem of a much-maligned poet." (M.J.O.) THOMAS, DYLAN Moynihan, William T., "Dylan Thomas' 'Hewn Voice'," Texas Studies in Liter- ature and Language, 1:313-26, Autumn, 195:N As Thomas's subject matter chanLd, the auditory techniques in his poetry shifted from mnemonic to pantomimic; there was also an accompanying shift in his poetry from "high specific, involved im- agery to a more general, obvious imagery ...- The more developed, the more room given the image, the more range and significance the auditory ele- ments are able to attain." (W.G.F.) THOMAS, EDWARD Danby, John F., "Edward Thomas," Critical Quarterly, 1:308-17, Winter, 1959. "Edward Thomas is one of the genuine sources of srength in 20th century poetry . ." (J.N.P.) TOLKIEN, JOHN RONALD RENEL Sparks, Patricia M., "Ethical Pattern in The Lord of the Rings," Critique: Studies in Modern Fiction, 3:30-42, Spring-Fall 1959. An examination of Tolkien's supernatur- al trilogy reveals his concern with the themes of free will in an ordered uni- verse; the conflict betwen good and evil, between the natural world and the tech- nological. Tolkien's fiction differs from that of C. S. Lewis and Charles Williams because the latter writes with the pur- pose of Chritian apolgetics. "Like true myth Tolkien's trilogy bears no specific message, despite its heavy overtones of moral significance. " (G.O.) WHARTON, EDITH Moseley, Edwin M., "'The Age of In- nocence: Edith Wharton's Weak Faust," College English, 21:156-60, December 1959. Edith Wharton apparently! intended the reader to draw parallels and contrasts between her characters and the main characters of Goethe's Faust as well as with characteristics of Tennyson's Elaine and the mythical and Diana and Apollo.
