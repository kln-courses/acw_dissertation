<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS An important part of the discussion is the use of the verbs by speakers from different social groups, namely, women, old men, young people, uneducated and educated speakers. The book also has a comparative dimension: the author specifies (often in footnotes) other North African dialects in which each verb is also attested in the literature, thus yielding a distributional description (isoglosses) for many of the verbs. The comparative material includes references to urban, rural and bedouin dialects in Tunisia and also Algeria, and sometimes even Morocco. Judeo-Arabic dialects (e.g. D. Cohen) are also taken into consideration. The abundant notes also provide much other information on the use of these verbs and the problems they involve. The book comprises two chapters-an Introduction and a Morphosemantic Analysis. The former deals with the scope and purpose of the study, including a comprehensive survey of the problems involved in identifying the verbs, verifying their sources and actual use in the three dialects concerned. The author also here describes his field-work methodology, i.e. the analysis of recorded and elicited material. Talmoudi relies for his analysis on Labov's 'four well-established principles' (Labov, 1975): I. The Consensus Principle; II. The Experimenter Principle; III. The Clear Case Principle; IV. The Principle of Validity (see Talmoudi, 12-13). Talmoudi also describes the speakers, whom he has classified into three groups (or four? this issue is unclear-see p. 14: what is G4 and which dialect does it represent?). Most of the material used for the study (60%) constitutes samples of spontaneous speech, though verb forms were also elicited in context or in conju- gation by direct questioning and other manipulation devices, as described on p. 13. Tables summarize the data for speakers and for the verbs, both in the Introduction and in the 'synoptic summary', section 2.4., at the end. Chapter ii is a detailed, systematic description of the 24 verbs of Romance origin. In each case the title gives the verb form and its translation into English. A short general discussion of the verb follows, together with 'diachronic remarks' which include a section on semantic adaptation and some illustrative examples. Then comes a section on ' morphophonological adaptation' and the verbal paradigms for each town where the verb is used. Finally, the 'syn- chronic remarks' describe the processes that occur in the verbal paradigm. The verbal paradigms present only the perfect and imper- fect tenses, although in the examples given, other verb forms, such as the imperative mood, sometimes appear. The chapter is organized so that the weak tri- radical verbs in themes III (3), VI (3) and X (1) come first. The denominative sane verbs of Spanish and Latin origin follow in section 2.3, and after them, the verbs of Italian and of French origin. This set is followed by the weak denominative verbs of Spanish origin (1), of Italian origin (1) and of French origin (1). Then come two verbs with ' Middle-w radical', in the author's terminology, and one verb with ' middle-y'. The semantic development in these verbs can be summarized as follows: (1) transfer of the original sense of the verb by giving it an Arabic form; (2) various semantic expansions through blurring of the original sense of the verb; (3) semantic narrowing of the original sense for certain purposes in the Arabic context. Sometimes there are differences of use of the various senses of certain verbs depending on the social status of the speaker (younger people, women), demonstrated in the examples pro- vided. There is not, however, any attempt to deal with these processes from a purely semantic viewpoint. The concluding section (2.4.) is a short sum- mary of the major features of the verbs des- cribed above. It includes a summary of the morpholexical subdivision, middle-weak tri- radical verbs, final-weak tri-radical verbs, strong tri-radical verbs, semantic character- istics, morphophonological changes, diachronic changes on the phonological level, phonotactic level, morphological changes, and synchronic changes of vowels and consonants. This sum- mary (2.4.4.1, 2.4.4.2) takes the mode of for- mulae, e.g.: s &lt; s, scopa (It.) &lt; sakkab (to play. scopa; p. 114); bb -. pp/-x, sdibbxo &gt; idppxo (p. 118), under clear classificatory headings, e.g., vowel changes, vowel lengthening, quanti- tative changes, consonant elisions and sequence elisions, etc. A puzzling point is the lack of consistency in the direction of the process-indicator arrow (&lt;,&gt;): in the sections on the diachronic changes (2.4.4.1.) the arrow points to the source of the process (as demonstrated in the example quoted above, from p. 114); however, in the sections that deal with synchronic changes, the arrow points to the resulting form (as in the example from p. 118). There does not seem to be any theoretical justification for these contrast- ing signs, especially since inconsistencies also occur elsewhere in the book. (In the list of symbols on p. 17 these arrows do not appear at all.) The present volume is announced as one of a projected three, but no information is given as to the contribution to be made by the next two which makes it difficult to define the linguistic significance of the present work satisfactorily. To sum up, the topic is interesting and the situation in the three dialects has been clearly presented. Let us hope that the next two volumes of this study will complete the basic formal classification of the foreign verbs in these dialects (and perhaps others in this area?), and will also provide a semantic analysis of this part of the Arabic lexicon.

The translation into English of the whole of the Ta'rTkh of al-Tabari (d. 311/923) was instigated in 1971 at the suggestion of Professor Ehsan Yar-Shater. Originally supported by the Iranian Institute of Translation and Publica- tion, which collaborated with UNESCO, since the revolution in Iran in 1979 the work has continued with assistance from the Translation Program of the [U.S.] National Endowment for the Humanities and the Persian Heritage Foundation (although the Ta'r'kh is in Arabic, al-Tabari came from Amol in the Iranian prov- ince of Mazandaran). Yar-Shater is the General Editor and he is aided by an Editorial Board of prominent scholars from various countries. For the purposes of translation, al-Tabar's text has been divided into segments of around two hun- dred pages of the standard Leiden edition, each segment assigned to an individual translator and appearing as a separate volume designed to be comprehensible on its own. So that reference may easily be made to the Arabic text, the pagination of the Leiden edition is provided in the margin. The volumes of translation are appearing as they are ready, not according to chronology, and Rosenthal's volume here takes us to the end of the Ta'rTkh, although it is one of the first to be published. Each volume has a useful index and bibliography, and it is planned that the first volume will contain a general introduction dealing with Tabarfs life, methods, the value of his work, etc., and that there will be a final volume of indexes to the whole translation. This reviewer is currently engaged in the translation of one of the volumes relating to the early Umayyad period. The Leiden edition of Tabar's Ta'rikh appeared between 1879 and 1901. The text established there has remained authoritative and was largely reproduced in the Cairo edition (1960-69), which has the advantage of having incorporated most of the Leiden addenda et emendanda into the body of the text (at least that is the case for the parts of the text with which I am most familiar). The Leiden edition was one of the important achievements of a brilliant era of European orientalist scholar- ship, and the quality of that text and its apparatus is a lasting tribute to those involved in producing it. Nevertheless, the edition was based on a limited number of MSS and since then a significant number of new ones have been found. As Rosenthal says in the foreword to his volume of translation, a new scholarly edition of the text is really needed but is unlikely to appear. It seems that circumstances have not made it possible for this translation as a whole to be used as an opportunity to introduce such new material and thus make a significant improvement on the Leiden text. Of the volumes under review here, only Rosenthal's presents significant new MS material (his fore- word indicates that he was working on the text already in 1978-79), the others translating only from the Leiden and Cairo texts. It would seem that time and economic difficulties have limited the scope of the project as a whole. The individual translators have been allowed to use their own discretion regarding the amount and density of commentary, although there is a general instruction that annotations should not exceed one quarter of the length of the text, and again one sees a striking difference between Rosenthal's work and the rest. While his volume has almost 1,000, sometimes quite detailed, footnotes (and the publishers are to be congratulated that notes are in fact at the foot of the page), Saliba's has less than 300. Quantity is no guarantee of quality but I mention this point to draw attention to the diversity of approach. Sample comparisons of these translations with the Arabic text, and my own experience, brings out the difficulties involved in attempting to give an accurate rendition of the text while at the same time producing readable English. Sometimes the text is patently corrupt, and independent parallel readings may be non- existent; sometimes the same text may be inter- preted in different ways; there are many techni- cal terms, the translation of which involves presuppositions which may or may not be acceptable; and there are long passages of poetry which are inherently ambiguous and which cannot be adequately translated. The style of translation to be adopted is also a problem and depends, like the nature of the commentary to be appended, on the readership which is envisaged. On the one hand, a case can be made out for a very literal translation, fol- lowing the word order of the Arabic closely, drawing attention to all the difficulties and alternative possibilities, and supplying much of the Arabic in parenthesis or footnote. On the other hand stress could be put on readability and the need to capture the quality of what in places is an exciting and gripping narrative. Not surprisingly, there is a certain amount of incon- sistency of approach, not only between the different volumes but also within individual volumes, and on almost every page where I set the translation against the text there were words or phrases which I would want to translate differently. This, it seems to me, is not only inevitable but very desirable in that it leads one to question one's own ideas. It seems to follow that those who will benefit most from this translation are those with some Arabic who are capable of comparing the 127</page><page sequence="3">translation with the text. Others will find much that is enjoyable but should beware of jumping to conclusions on the basis of a translation that may represent only one of a number of possible solutions to a problem. Nevertheless, the translation as a whole will undoubtedly make al-Tabar's work available to a wider audience and one imagines that its appearance will espe- cially excite non-Arabist historians of late anti- quity and of the transition from Hellenistic to Islamic civilization in the Mediterranean world and the Middle East. Perhaps the most import- ant thing to be said about th whole, and an indication of scholars who have been accusl with the Ta'rFkh as a main sou to make use of the translatic with the Arabic.

HAWTING AzIz AL-AZMEH: Arabic thought and Islamic societies. (Exeter Arabic and Islamic Series.) [xvii], 295 pp. London: Croom Helm, 1986. £29.95. This is a kaleidoscopic work in which Professor Azmeh, eschewing chronology, draws freely from all branches of the Islamic intellec- tual tradition in order to convey the essentials of a world view. Such an enterprise necessarily and repeatedly raises the problem of how to achieve an adequate level of generalization while hold- ing on to the diversity and the tensions which existed within the Islamic as within all human society. In responding to this problem Azmeh has adopted (or created) a style so remarkable that it threatens to become itself the major characteristic of the book, a style which more demands illustration than comment. Here, in a chapter entitled ' Relations of creation, sympathy and analogy ', he introduces a subsec- tion entitled 'God and man' (p. 64). (I omit only a parenthesis.) The correlativity of microcosm and macro- cosm intimates the thesis, rejected by some for ideas unconnected with the implicit metaphysic of the two worlds, that God and man are correlative. Humanity, through Adam, is a khilafa of God, according to famous Qur'anic pronouncements, and the caliphate is an agency of God, which implies both continuity and transference, and this in turn implies, and indeed requires, considera- tions of homology and isomorphy, despite the doctrinal complications that Ash'arites felt acutely when dealing with this matter. The centrality of humanity and its represen- tational relationship to God can be seen as grounded in an ontological community, and this position was held, we saw, by representa- tives of pantheistic monism which is one possible variant of the chain of being. Con- tinuity in the opposite sense is not very dif- ferent. Instead of looking at man as homolo- gous to God and metaphysically continuous with Him- ... we could well look at anthropomorphism as a correlative, whereby man and God are taken for homologues. The continuity here is not only what we may describe as a seminal one, with God creating man and everything else, physically, and out of nothing, but is also a continuity in analogy. One is the metonym of the other. This clarity of argument and sensitivity to words is sustained throughout. The referential correctness of some of Azmeh's observations is not immediately clear. Here, in a subsection entitled 'Knowledge and its object', he tries to pin down the essentials of the Islamic attitude to knowledge (p. 109). Knowledge is an activity, not the content of such activity as discourse exercises; it has no special and privileged ontological reality. Knowledge as such has no particular quid- dity, except within the context of a rare Platonism where it was an assembly of arche- types and part of an ontology, not an epis- tomology. The absence of an epistemology in medieval Arabic thought as distinct from psychology or linguistics is the correlative of this state of affairs which, contrary to the duality of mind and matter with which Car- tesianism inseminated modern thought and culture, did not conceive of reality and knowledge as states of differential quiddity. These are highly original observations to which few will fail to respond. Not all, however, will agree on the intimated absence of epistemology in medieval Arabic thought. The following is, perhaps, less original. It incorporates what I would tentatively assess to be a correct judge- ment on 'traditionalism' with a number of broader issues, including, and not least, an affirmation of commitment (p. 181). Traditionalism has a rationality which is proper to itself, and which is no less compel- ling than positivist or syllogistic rationality. Traditionalism can assimilate anything by means of its rationality, for in the aid of this rationality is a fact already mentioned, that any singular text is inexhaustible and infinitely interpretable. Traditionalist ration- ality is distinct from the syllogistic; we must eschew culturalist narcissism, and realise that traditionalist rationality is not necessarily a privation of triumphalist positivism or of the syllogistics. The rejection of such narcissism would seem to spring not only from the rigorous compulsion of historical rationality, but from the inter-connection of rationalities. For after all, just as in the positive sciences there is no room for theory as such, as the event and the explanation are coterminous, logic itself is a repeatable transformation which is both rule and instance, and logical inference proceeds by the citation of a struc- tural similarity on which inferences are sup- posed to be based-a sort of solipsistic self- justification, an analogy in which logic is grounded and of which it is a form. Who would gainsay this? Azmeh tilts, in his preface (pp. iv-vi), at the windmills of Orientalism (they are not giants these fiddlers on the verges of two cultures) and proposes ' to revise the present state of scholar- ship in medieval Arabic thought' by incorporating into the discipline 'what has become the common stock of historical and other social and human sciences'.
