<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS interests" (p. 96). Art makes this stance pos- sible by means of three characteristics. First is an imitative and image-like quality which, through its vividness, can express ideas directly and powerfully without being distracted by ephemeral matters. Then there is its isolation, which separates art from the world and en- courages its internal unity. Last is the symbol- ism of art which, like poetic metaphor, evokes meanings more effectively than the more literal statements of science and philosophy. What is surprising, however, is how in a multitude of instances, from the first essay to the last, Michelis's sensitivity to the workings of art and to its tradition that is far older than the eighteenth-century doctrine of disinterested- ness, offers the reader a series of observations that belie this dogma of aesthetics. The opening essay, "Latent Movement or the Latent Picturesque," provides the justification for its rejection: ". . . a more important role must be given to the criteria of the senses and the feelings. More attention must be given to certain phenomena which contravene the dominant theories of the age, no matter how insignificant these may be, how symptomatic they may appear, or how irreconcilable they seem" (p. 18). Michelis criticizes various inter- pretations of classical architecture, insisting that the subtle curves of the stylobate and the columns of the Parthenon, together with irreg- ular positionings of certain decorative features, are so designed to be perceived through the posture and placement of the body as "an active, pulsating existence" rather than a merely geometrical one (p. 28). These irregularities, he claims, make a perfect work more lively and real than sterile academic perfection would (p. 21). The evocation of such movement, moreover, exists in all arts (p. 32). In his dis- cussion of the Byzantine icon, for example, Michelis objects to an interpretation by which the picture creates a magical realism where spectator and icon join together in the real space of the church. Yet he considers how the figures, through their gestures, differences in scale, gradation in tones, and variety of colors, create an ideal space in which they move, transferring the spectator to it in imagination (pp. 172-74, 137). Again, in discussing con- temporary architecture, Michelis writes of the need to organize materials as if they were living elements, creating in the physical and imaginative involvement of the spectator a movement that brings a static structure into dynamic vibration (pp. 210-11). Michelis's honesty of thought thus leads him to respond to the conditions the arts create rather than to principles that stand on independent ground. This is but one provocative issue. Nearly every essay offers ideas to be considered and learned. While these may not always be en- tirely original, much thought and awareness of the arts informs Michelis's discussions, and, above all, great sensitivity to the interaction of the arts and the viewer. The unidentified translator has produced a fluent and coherent text with barely an awkwardness. However, it would have been useful to supply the original dates of the essays, largely because many of them deal with recent developments and prob- lems. Yet this is minor. It hardly qualifies a volume that can be of great assistance in the continuing task of comprehending the living arts. ARNOLD BERLEANT C.W. Post Center of Long Island University KRAUSS, ROSALIND. Passages in Modern Sculp- ture. N.Y.: Viking Press, 1977, 308 pp., $18.95. Prior to Rodin, the development of western sculpture was concerned with two contrasts: that between modelling - adding material and taking it away - and carving, the method "of those who only take away and bring to light the human figure potentially hidden in a marble block" (Rudolf Witthower, Sculpture Processes and Principles, 1977, p. 80); and that between works meant to be seen from only one point of view and works meant to be seen from all sides. Krauss's study of sculpture since Rodin centers on two different contrasts: that between works whose surface "mirrors" an inner core of the work and works whose sur- face is thought to be independent of such a core; and that between works which reveal their structure all at once - and so, seem to be "in" an illusionistic space outside the space of everyday experience - and works which, because they only gradually "show" themselves, are objects in the viewer's space. I begin with this abstract statement of prin- ciples because Krauss's brilliant new book illus- trates the development of modern sculpture as the working out of these two oppositions. Thus, Rodin breaks the link between surface and core. "We are left with gestures that are un- supported by appeals to their own anatomical backgrounds" (p. 27). Boccioni, by contrast, uses his Development of a Bottle in Space "to become a disembodied intelligence circulating 510</page><page sequence="2">Reviews through an ideal space to grasp the thing from all sides at once" (p. 45). Similarly, we call distinguish between Tatlin's use of real space (p. 55) and Gabo's placement of his sculptures in "a special, ideated space" (p. 58). Brancusi and Duchamp make objects "which are . . . resistant to analysis" because "not conceived around a 'core'" (p. 106). Their works are in "the real space" (p. 106) they share with the viewer. Giacometti's Suspended Ball moves in "the real time of experience, open-ended and specifically incomplete" (p. 114). Krauss's posi- tive evaluation of surrealism and her interest in its denial of any rigid or fixed separation of life and art mark her break with formalist criticism. Her earlier book on David Smith, Terminal Iron Works, could be fitted within the formalist framework. Passages criticizes the formalist critique of minimal art. The basic dividing line here, established by Michael Fried's seminal essay "Art and Objecthood" (Art Forum, 1967), is between those (Caro and his followers) who work to establish the differ- ence between a sculpture and ordinary objects and the minimalists, who aspire to deny "any distinction between the world of art and the world of everyday objects" (p. 198). Krauss says: "We should try to unpack the notion of theatricality" (p. 204), the pejorative term used by Fried to describe minimalist works. Here what she says seems not entirely clear. Her own account depends upon Fried's dividing line; only, while he criticizes theatri- cal works, she suggests that they have impor- tant virtues. The minimalist Judd is praised for denying that sculptures must have "a natural- istic and anthropomorphic image" (p. 254); minimalists see traditional sculpture as "founded on an idealist myth" (p. 242), and aim to deny the illusion that "withdraws the sculptural object from literal space and places it in a metaphorical one" (p. 266). But since Krauss later says that "the abstractness of mini- malism makes it less easy to recognize the human body in those works... . Yet our bodies . . . continue to be the subject of this sculp- ture" (p. 279, my italics), how can she accept these minimalist claims? If even Michael Heizer's Double Negative - "two slots, each forty feet wide and a hundred feet deep, dug into the tops of two mesas, sited opposite one another" (p. 280) - is interpreted as "a meta- phor for the self," what remains of the mini- malist notion that a sculpture is nothing more than a (literal) physical object? Fried says: "Certain basic facts . . . about possessing a body . . . rendered wholly abstract, are the norms of Caro's art" (Anthony Caro, 1969, p. 9). Krauss seems to suggest that all sculptures must be read in these terms. For Fried, Caro's sculptures defeat theater by revealing themselves "all at once." So when Krauss argues that Caro's Early One Morning can be seen from different directions in two "mutually incompatible" (p. 191) ways, she is perhaps saying that in this sense even Caro's work is theatrical. Fried's concept of the "the- atrical" is complex and perplexing, and that Krauss fails to make that concept transparently clear is hardly a severe criticism of her account. At one point, her argument does fail in a more serious way. An abstract expressionist painting consists of a material surface and an interior which opens illusionistically behind that surface. This analogy between the psychological interior of the artist and the illusionistic interior of the picture makes it possible to see the pictorial ob- ject as a metaphor for human emotions (p. 256) . By contrast, "the minimal artists insisted on making works that would refute the unique- ness, privacy and inaccessibility of experience" (p. 259). Krauss draws a parallel with Witt- genstein's argument about the impossibil- ity of a private language. Like Witt- genstein, the minimal artists want "meaning [to] be seen as arising from a public, rather than a private space" (p. 262). But this anal- ogy is just mistaken. The abstract expression- ists and their followers wrote extensively about the meaning of their works. In no sense were their images like the private language imag- ined by Wittgenstein. Furthermore, as Krauss's own account of him indicates, Duchamp's idea that he could make art that would not appear to be coming from "the sculptor's personally held ideas or emotions" (p. 72) was mistaken. His fascination with eroticism, the mechanical, and chance (p. 100) gives his work a most per- sonal quality. Thus the contrast between an art based upon "private" meanings and a minimalist art grounded on a "public" mean- ing breaks down entirely. What does remain, however, is a variation on the opposition I mentioned in the first paragraph: the differ- ence between sculpture modelled on a self with an "inner core" and sculpture denying we can think of the self as having such a core. Recent analytic work on the concept of the self has had little to say about how art can mirror, modify, or even create models of the self. Passages offers the fascinating suggestion that 511</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS thinking about the nature of sculpture could contribute to important areas of philosophy that have not recently been linked with aes- thetics. At the start of this review I contrasted the traditional distinctions - modelling/carving, single/multiple points of view - with the modern oppositions analyzed by Krauss. Fur- ther reflection, now, might suggest that the tra- ditional and modern distinctions come to the same thing. The carver aims to reveal the "true figure" hidden at the core of the marble block; the modeller shows us that there need be no correspondence between the inner core of the work and its outward appearance. The traditional sculptor who insists that his work be seen only from one point of view pursues the same aim as the modernist who wishes to re- veal the entire structure of his work in one view. Conversely, the traditional sculptor who intends his work to be seen from all sides is, like the minimalist, producing an object whose structure we will only gradually discover by moving around it. Thus we can imagine how Krauss's argument might be extended to show an important affinity between traditional and modern sculpture. It is characteristic of this most remarkable book that it raises such fas- cinating general issues. DAVID CARRIER Carnegie-Mellon University WOOD, ROBIN. Personal Views: Explorations in Film. London: Gordon Fraser, 1976, 248 pp.. $5.90. It's an oddity of contemporary film research and criticism in our language that British film studies have never achieved superiority over American, perhaps not even parity. The British after all still write expository prose much better than we do; and our film students, publishing in a much bigger country, still have no con- venient equivalent for the British Film Insti- tute. At any rate, we now have available the first collection of essay-work by the most widely known and respected British film critic, Robin Wood. His remarks on cinematic realism ("Levin and the Jam") are a revised lecture; and the essay on Welles's Touch of Evil has only ap- peared in French. Otherwise the chief periodi- cal source seems to be Film Comment. Perhaps Wood would not reject the statement that the gist of Views, as a book, amounts to its de- tailed considerations, scattered throughout, of 10-odd films: except for von Sternberg's Scarlet Empress, all released 1940-60; nearly all in a tradition of "poetic" horror; and all shot by critically fashionable directors (Welles, Ophuls, Hawks, Mizoguchi, Hitchcock, and Jacques Tourneur). The fellow critics seriously discussed in Views include Wood's teacher and guru, F. R. Leavis - the "Levin" essay homages Leavis's essay on Anna Karenina - Victor Perkins, and Peter Wollen, specifically Wollen's Signs and Meaning in the Cinema (1969). Most remark- able in Views I should call the critiques, surely all future anthology pieces, on Ophuls's Letter to an Unknown Woman, on the Tourneur- Lewton 1942-43 RKO horror-movie collabora- tion, and on two postwar masterpieces by Mizoguchi. The best polemic piece, "Hawks De-Wollenized," efficiently exposes and de- molishes Wollen's use of a structuralist cum neo-Marxist terminology as a substitute for describing what really happens in Hawks's films. From his earlier monographs of the mid/late 1960s, Wood thus continues here the same ele- gant thematic criticism. He carefully concen- trates on the technical means by which adult themes get into good movies; and he has the excellent philosophical habit of using a second illustration to control the generalized argu- ment being made with a first example: cf. pp. 228ff., 54ff. As the heterogeneously chosen sub- jects of his previous monographs show, Wood has so far spent his whole critical career re- maining modish (which is why, despite his gifts, he has yet to do the decisive book on any one director). So it may be auteurism's having gone a little out of fashion that makes Personal Views more relaxed about the collaborative credits on the films signed by his superstar directors. One essay shows how Tourneur deals in his most successful films with his limitations in handling actors. And the discussion of Hawks makes the stimulating argument that his oeuvre should be divided not by genres (farce, melodrama, s-f), but rather into the two chief imaginative worlds inhabited by his regular scriptwriters, including William Faulk- ner. In terms of the JAAC review column, Wood may be said to devote sufficient pages in Views to individual theorists: structuralist, "Marxist," "auteurist. These pages are as distrustful as Leavis of any consciously systematic or termino- logical approach to criticism. Wood is in fact 512</page></plain_text>
