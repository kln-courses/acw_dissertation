<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mr. Dendy then read a Paper on Anthropogenesis, which he pre- faced by quoting the remark of a Rt. Rev. Doctor at Norwich, that it was the duty of every man of faith to inquire more, ancl of every man of science to believe more; ancl he saicl that it was in that spirit that the paper was written :? (Abstract.) The paper referred to the two contrasted opinions regarding the ge? nesis of man, creation ancl evolution, analysing the clogmas of Lamarck and Oken (to the rejection of all historic testimony), ancl the hypothesis of Mr. Darwin, transmutation or natural selection. It was argued, that the origin of man in the evolution of a monad (a process in which, in</page><page sequence="2">xxx Journal of the Anthropological Society. Mr. Darwin's words, " force almost creates in production"), is as great a mystery as the creation of a man. Allusion was made to the experiment of Crosse, of Bristol, the vitalising or evolution of an insect from inorganic matter. Spontaneous development, the doubt of a first cause, necessitates, of course, the possibility of an effect without a cause. Passing over the zoophytes and lower animals, the paper discussed the subject of transmutation, by a happy accident in the act of generation of the most anthropomorphous of the simke, the Chimpanzee, into perfect man. Yet, this man-like ape, with all his association with man, is absolutely deficient in the most noble endowment or faculty of speech, although provided with vocal organs almost identical with those of man; while pies, and claws, ancl parrots, can, by imitation, articulate the human language. It is strange, if transmutation be a fact, that during the whole historic period, not the slightest approximation to the " missing link" has ever been noted in the generative accident of a monkey ; indeed, the ape has seemed rather to have retrograded in his anthropomorphism. In referring to the most important comparative anatomy of the skull ancl the brain, allusion was made to the rudimental lateral ventricle ancl the non- overlapping of the cerebellum, arising from an arrest in the growth of the cerebrum in the simise ; the brain of the young Chimpanzee ancl the infant so closely resembling each other. In reference to palseonto- logy, in proof of their theory, the disciples of Darwin taboo all historic testimony of the Jews, and adopt the testimony of the rock, ancl yet palaeontology, with all their specious advocacy, has proved little or nothing for transition. Then, the equatorial apes and dwarfs (the highest simia ancl the lowest homo), although for agesin juxtaposition, have never been known to " cotton" together. The contemplation of this persistent degradation, certainly favours Max Miiller's assertion, that the chasm between ape and man can never be bridged over. In favour of plurality of race, in coincidence with Ruclolfi, Vogt, etc, allusion was made to the greater difference between the Chimpanzee ancl Gorilla, than between the Manclingo ancl the Guinea Negro, the latter of whom has never, in any climate, changed his form, his colour, or his wool. The historic traditions of Genesis were adduced in illustration of polygenesis, Adam being the archetype of the last creation, the Aryan or Caucasian variety; the word man being, therefore, considered a generic term, signifying mankind. Holy writ may, therefore, be congenial with historic anthropology, Shem, ancl Ham, ancl Japhet being the progenitors of the three races, with which number Cuvier was content to form his classification. The paper, therefore, did not agree with Mr. Darwin or Sir John Lubbock regarding the simial parentage, or the " utter degradation" of man in his primitive form. The following gentlemen joined in the discussion. The Rev. Dunbar Heath observed that the central point of the paper appeared to be, whether it is more likely that there shoulcl have been an original creator of organised matter than that monacls should have been developed from inorganised matter. He hacl been accused of being an atheist, he would therefore state what his opinions were, that</page><page sequence="3">Proceedings of the Society. xxxi it might be seen whether that term was correctly applied. He thought that they might feel there is a Gocl ancl trust to Him; but they clicl not know him. The composite organism called man was a duality consisting of intelligence and feelings, including moral feelings. Though the two were in all actions united in one, they were logically clistin- guishable ; thus it was possible to feel what they clicl not know, and to know what they clid not feel. For instance, he felt the heat of the fire but he clid not know7 the nature of heat; no one knew anything of the cause of heat, there wras no novelty in that opinion; it was admitted that feeling was different from know ing. Knowing was also distinct from feeling: it was known, for example, that two sides of a triangle are greater than the third, but they did not feel it; the know? ledge was not accompanied by any emotion; he knew it logically, but he had no feeling of it. Having thus shown the paths by which they must travel, they might trace the source of man's belief in God. It was found that in all times of man's experience, whether of sorrow or of joy, he feels there is a God ; in times of misery man leans upon a Gocl, ancl he does the same in times of happiness. No society could wipe away that feeling?mankind, it must be admitted, accepts a God. He clid not deny that. But it was a different matter when the question came to be examined in a scientific society, whether it was more pro? bable that the origin of man was by creation or evolution. It was a million times more probable, in his opinion, that a living monad w7as evoked from inorganic matter than that it shoulcl have been created. By the latter hypothesis it wras attempted to explain a little mystery by one a million times greater, for it was more easy to conceive the original existence of a monad than of a Gocl. The Hebrews solved the difficulty by conceiving their deity to be an organised being, who clothed himself with light as with a garment, ancl was surroundecl with organised matter as a vestment,?the strength of the hills is His also. That was the Hebrew way of getting out of the difficulty. But the Greeks, in their Septuagint, altered the Hebrew Bible to introduce the iclea of a pure spirit; he thought that in sketching the question as he had clone he hacl logically given an answer to the paper. With regard to such matter they knewr nothing about it, they only knew the phe? nomena of matter; the phenomena could be weighed, their effects could be calculated, and their properties might be known; but of matter itself nothing could be known. They might assume certain things, they might conceive points endowed with certain forces ancl call them matter, but it was merely a name; they clicl not know matter; ancl in the same way they might speak of Gocl, but they knew Him not. Referring again to the paper, he said he dicl not think that Mr. Dendy hacl shown that creation was more probable than evolution ; he could not conceive independent creation, but he coulcl conceive it to be possible that a little carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen being the centre of certain forces might, by their mutual actions, produce a fourth force, and that might be an organic force and act according to a type. Organic forces act with a purpose, and might produce others ; how organic forces could be evolved from forces not organic they did not know, but he contended that it w7as a millionfolcl more improbable</page><page sequence="4">xxxii Journal of the Anthropological Society. that such forces should have been created than that they should have evolved. Mr. Pike considered the basis of the paper to be the theory that it is more probable that a creator has produced man than that man has been evoked from a cell. He felt great difficulty in discussing any subject which seemed to require a confession of faith. As a matter of opinion, he thought Darwinism might as easily as any other scientific view be reconciled with scripture; but inasmuch as the paper was avowedly founded in fact upon the Bible, he felt that he coulcl hardly call its conclusions in question without exciting a suspicion that he wished also to call in question the book upon which it wTas founded. He clicl not see how it was possible to discuss the paper without the introduction of subjects which a scientific society should avoid. Dr, Duncan saicl that the Committee of Investigation, whose recom- mendation hacl been alluded to, hacl no wish to limit reasonable dis? cussion upon sacred subjects; but it considered that it was not advisable to publish every thing that might fall from the Fellows in the course of a free and open debate. He was hardly prepared to hear Dr. Dencly's paper treated in a rnetaphysical manner, and although he admired the eccentric arguments he hacl heard, he considered that the Fellows shoulcl limit themselves to the analysis of concrete facts. The question really was, not as Mr. Dunbar Heath hacl put it, but clicl man come from an ape? Darwin hacl never written a passage which asserted the ape origin of man, and it was not fair, nor according to scientific logic, to infer from passages in the Origin of Species that such was Mr. Darwin's opinion. In no place hacl Mr. Darwin asserted the origin of the monad from inorganic matter, but he had protested that analogy was an unsafe guicle. Dr. Duncan considered that the reason why Mr. Darwin hacl not carried his theory farther was because he hacl insufficient data, ancl he thus gave a tacit reproof to scientific men who like to jump at conclusions upon very slight facts. There was at present no more right to assert that man came from an ape than that the species of a genus well and structurally separated from those of another descended genetically. The structural peculiarities of the nervous systems of men and apes hacl much in common, but there were considerable microscopical differences, some of which had lately been published by Lockhart Clarke in the Philosophical Transactions. Nevertheless, it was an uncomfortable fact that the anomalies in the origin ancl insertion of muscles in man were normalities in the ape. The " sports" were backwards to the quadrumana. Whatever was the truth, it was evident that in Holy Writ man came from "the dust;" and if so, whence comes the monkey? metaphorically from "the earth." Dr. Crisp saicl he had listened to Mr. Dendy's paper with much pleasure, and although not opposed to Darwin's theory, in the main, he thought, with Mr. Dendy, that the line of demarcation between the apes and the human species was so well marked, that he felt surprised that any persons who had studied the anatomy of the quadrumana could come to a contrary opinion. He coulcl say a great deal upon this question, but he woulcl only occupy the time of the Society in</page><page sequence="5">Proceedings of the Society. xxxiii alluding to a few important points. The anthropoid apes and the generality of the monkeys hacl a clark-coloured sclerotica ; the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrse of the gorilla were longer than those of the lion, rhinoceros, or hippopotamus, the thirteen ribs of the gorilla and of the chimpanzee; the absence of skull-sutures; the ab? sence of the ligamentum teres of the hip-joint; the want of the styloid processes; the rudimentary mammillary processes, ancl many other osteological characters might especially be mentioned. But when wTe came to the visceral anatomy of the anthropoid apes, of the gorilla, for exanrple, as he (Dr. Crisj)) had recently shown at the British Associa? tion, what a difference was observed ! No valvulse conniventes in the intestines, in the gorilla the coecurn and large intestines of enormous size, ancl furnished with glands cliffering materially from those of men ; a tripartite liver, and other peculiarities which time would not allow him to mention. Those who supported the transition theory of ape to man, Dr. Crisp thought, were like special pleaders, who saw the resemblances but forgot the differences. In 1864 he had heard Pro? fessor Huxley state in his lectures at the College of Surgeons, that anthropoid apes had no penis-bone. Not satisfied with this statement, he, Dr. Crisp, as on other occasions, determined to judge for himself, ancl in more than a dozen anthropoid apes (chimpanzees ancl ourangs) he hacl found a penis-bone in all; the gorilla he could not speak of, as one he had examined was a female, and in the other the organs of generation were absent. In a young ape, sent over in spirits, said to have been a Koolookamba (Nshiego-mbouvS), he clid not find a jDenis- bone. The question as to the existence of a penis-bone in the gorilla was one of great interest; he had placed on the table the penis-bones of the orang and chimpanzee, and of many species of monkeys that he hacl dissectecl. Dr. Carter Blake thanked Mr. Dendy for a thoroughly philosophi? cal paper, which bore out his (Mr. Dendy's) high reputation as a scientific man. He was glad to see that the Anthropological Society maintained their old character of producing the strongest advocates against the Darwinian theory; Mr. Dendy had spoken of Darwin as if he were the Coryphseus ofthe transmutation hypothesis, but it ought to be remembered that Professor Owen (whose writings had been strangely misinterpreted by the less educated class of Darwinites, in and out of the Society,) whilst opposing Darwinism, had long ad- vocated a rational system of accounting for the origin of species accord? ing to the method of " derivation by secondary" law exemplifiecl in his " Anatomy of Vertebrates." He expressed what he thought of those Darwinites who coulcl not appreciate scientific investigation, ancl could only pick up the garbage which Lamarck ancl Darwin dropped, and he wished such scientific dabblers would just try to find out what it was that Prof. Owen really said and really meant. With regard to Peter, the wild boy, to whom Mr. Dendy hacl alluded, cases of the same kind were described in Professor Vogt's " Memoir on Microcephali." As regarded the " hippocampus minor " controversy, he was glad to see that Mr. Dendy, an anatomist " loyal et comp6tent," was on the right side, ancl agreed with Tiedemann, Cruvelhier, and Owen, that the structures vol. vii. d</page><page sequence="6">xxxiv Journal of the Anthropological Society. called the " third lobe," " posterior horn of lateral ventricle," and " hip- pocampus minor", wTere peculiar to, and characteristic of man, while absent in the brains of the highest apes. Less reliable anatomists had impugned this, but in the year 1868 the truth might as well be told. Mr. Dendy had selected the chimpanzee as the species of ape most closely allied to man. As its muscular system hacl been thoroughly investigated, the chimpanzee might most certainly be most convenient for comparison; but in his (Dr. Blake's) opinion the gorilla was the species which most resembled man. The faculty of speech hacl been stated by Dr. Broca to be coincident with one of the frontal convolutions of the brain, a convolution which might be conveniently called " Broca's convolution." Mr. Dendy hacl shown that that convolution was developed in man to a greater extent than in the apes. Dr. Blake saicl he was much j)leased with the collection Dr. Crisp had exhibited of the penis-bones of various apes, ancl he coulcl not but notice that the size of the penis- bone seemed to bear no relation whatever to the size of the animal; it was as large in the small bonnet-chinois monkey (Macacus sinicus) as in the chacma (0ynoeephalus 'porcarius). In the koolookamba, as Dr. Crisp saicl, it might be absent, ancl that was a very strange fact, as the kooloocamba, according to Du Chaillu's description, was more closely allied to man than any other ape. Though Mr. Dendy's facts w7ere exceedingly well marshalled to oppose the hypothesis of trans? mutation, they should not make Fellows of the Society forget that the human remains of greatest antiquity are certainly the most anthropoid. Dr. Blake, in conclusion, observed that as it seemed to be the fashion that evening for gentlemen to make their confessions of faith, he woulcl say that his conviction w7as that the differences between man ancl ape did not consist in speech, mind, soul, ancl thought, but in anatomical differences; the distinction between the sub-class archencephala, com- prising man alone, and the sub-class gyrencephala, being enormous. Mankind differecl from the apes by distinetions which could be tested by the scalpel, the callipers, ancl the measuring tape, ancl by nothing else.

The Director announced that the Council had resolved that, for the future, any member of the Society who sent to the Secretary ad? dressed and stamped envelopes, corresponding to the number of even? ing meetings in the Session, would receive a printed slip of the Pro? ceedings the day after each meeting. The adjourned discussion on Mr. Dendy's paper on " Anthropo- genesis," read at the previous meeting, was then resumed. Mr. Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie saicl there was one thing in the paper, in reference to his lamented friend Mr. Crosse, on which he desired to make a few remarks. The discoveries of that gentleman, of electrical acari, were spoken of as the result of experiments under? taken for the purpose of developing them; but that was not so. The spontaneous generation of these acari was quite unexpected by Mr. Crosse, and was the result of an experiment undertaken with a different object; he subsequently instituted exact experiments. The first experiment hacl been continued for 212 days in a darkened room, when, on looking at the apparatus, he observed a number of white spots, which budded into worms, and then assumed the appear? ance of scaly insects. In another experiment, in which an oyster- shell hacl been subjected to electrical action for one hundred ancl forty-eight days,?the healthy oyster disappeared, and a marine plant grew out of it. Mr. Mackenzie further explained that Mr. Crosse hacl no desire to make known the spontaneous generation of electrical acari; but that a conversation between him and the poet Southey having been overheard by the editor of a Taunton paper, the dis? covery was blazoned forth with much exaggeration, and against his wish. He had been personally acquainted with Mr. Crosse, and would, with the chairman's permission, read a letter on the subject. d2</page><page sequence="8">xxxvi Journal of the Anthropological Society. June 12th, 1853. Broomfield, Sunday. My dear Sir,?The experiment to which you allucle in your com? munication, and wdiich was very carefully carried out, was the following:? I prepared a tubulated glass retort, through the tube of which was passed a wire of platinum, hermetieally sealed, stancling vertically in the bulb of the retort. The glass tube fitted air-tight into its neck. This retort was supported by a wooden frame, and its open end clip- ped into a glass cup of mercury, from wdiich proceecled a long wire of platinum through the whole length of the retort, and wTas bent at right angles where it entered the bulb, so as to be parallel to the first wire, about two inches distant from it. The bulb was half-filled with a carefully prepared solution of silicate of potash. The opposite poles of a sustaining battery were connected with either wire, ancl a iveak electrical current kept constantly passing from wire to wire, decom- posing the liquicl in the bulb. Oxygen ancl hyclrogen gasesv/ere given out constantly, which were liberated from the mouth of the retort, and slowly bubbled out through the mercury in the glass cup. No communication wdth the atmospheric air was possible. The solution w7as highly caustic, ancl the atmosphere of the retort was, of course, expilosive; and yet, in this caustic solution, and yet, under this explosive atmosphere, one single remarkably fine acarus made its ap? pearance on the hundred and fortieth day. The apparatus was kept in a clark cellar. I give no opinion as to the cause of the appearance of this acarus, not having formed any opinion on the subject. I have now fresh expe? riments in action on the connexion of electricity with animal and vegetable life. You are welcome to clo as you please with this letter, and I beg to remain, dear Sir, Yours sincerely, Kenneth Mackenzie, Esq., F.S.A. Andrew Crosse. Mr. A. L. Lewis saicl, in reference to the allusions to the apparent contradictions in the accounts of creation given in the first and second chapters of Genesis, that there were no differences in them that might not be reconciled. He agreed with Mr. Dendy in thinking that it is far more easy to believe in the existence of a Creator than in the springing up of everything spontaneously, no one knew where nor how7. He thought, however, it was a pity that any discussion should have arisen on that point, as it was impossible to bring forward con- clusive evidence on either side, ancl, therefore, no practical end coulcl be attained. Mr. Dibley considered there was not sufficient evidence to justify any convictions on the matter, ancl that it was not possible, by any scientific investigation, to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. There was a potency of form in Nature, the cause of which coulcl not be graspecl by science. Thus, life is a potential form, ancl the matter in which it is made apparent is nothing more than an inert mass. The connection between them was, however, beyond human comprehen- sion, and not until man hacl some higher powers given to him could</page><page sequence="9">Dendy on Anthropogenesis. xxxvii they properly discuss the subject, ancl arrive at any scientific conclu? sion. The only way to arrive at a rational conclusion on the matter was to reason from a general principle. There was known to be a certain jDerfect order in all things, governed by certain laws, ancl the most rational explanation appeared to be to allow the existence of a Being, who is order and perfection in himself. Major Owen thought that Mr. Dendy was right in reference to Holy Writ, ancl that if the facts stated rested on a basis that wras un- tenable, it was better to get ricl of them. Mr. Dendy in accepting the confession of faith of the Rev. Dunbar Heath, said, he would waive all polemical allusions, ancl the discussion of the metaphysics of Berkeley, and limit the arguments between Mr. Heath and himself to the question regarding the inorganic monad, ancl the vitalised ovulum. Mr. Heath affirmed his belief that it was a millionfold more difficult to accept the idea of a creation, than that of a monad. Why 1 They were both assumptions ; but for one there was tradition, for the other there was not. Admitting the existence of the ovulum in preference to the monad, we coulcl reason on and accept its evolution, a process that is hourly exemplified in the uterus of a mother, ancl thus we might readily conceive the origin of historic man. In confirmation of his views, he might cite the objection to the monad of many an accomplishecl Anthropologist, especially that of Paul Broca. (Mr. Dendy read a passage from the works of Dr. Broca, clearly illustrating his decisive opinion.) In alluding to the comments of Mr. Pike on his reference to Holy Writ, Mr. Dendy reminded him that he only adduced the historic tradition of the Bible in his illustra? tion of Polygenesis, as he woulcl the record of Josephus, or the u Dis- quisitiou on Ancient India," by Robertson. Of the devotional and theological portion he had been scrupulously reticent. Mr. Dendy expressed his thanks to Dr. Crisp for exhibiting his valuable specimens of the os penis of apes, as a very prominent exemplification of the comparative dissimilarity of the apes to man. In referring to the speech of Dr. Carter Blake, he was gratifiecl that Dr. Blake thought that the comparative anatomy of the paper strongly sup? ported the difference between man and ape : yet he (Mr. Dendy), thought that the condition of the mental faculties (so to speak), was even of greater importance than the structural forms : the power of speech, for instance, afforded a powerful example of this distinction ; the organic structure appertaining to utterance, being closely resem- bling in man ancl ape, yet the endowment or faculty of speech being utterly wanting in the simhe. Regarding the Neanderthal ancl other skulls (casts of which were before him), there hacl been very great exaggeration. We might light on crania of equal deformity in men of the present day; ancl with respect to pakeontological "finds", there was often much suspicion. The quarrymen of France were known to practise fraucls?for instance, their own manufactures of them, langues du chat, were often offered ancl accepted as nint-arrow heads. Mr. Dendy then exhibited the skeleton of a rickety abortion, which he himself hacl delivered, ancl which, he believed, had it been founcl in strata associated with the relies of extinct mammalia, would have been</page><page sequence="10">xxxviii Journal of the Anthropological Society. readily accepted as the " missing link". But, even if we found the treasure, it woulcl not prove the Transmutation Theory. It might indicate degradation of species, as well as exaltation, the regress as well as the progress of man ; favourmg the notion of the Oceanic savage that the ape is a dwindlecl ancl degraded man. With regard to the Electric Acarus of Mr. Crosse, alluded to by Mr. Mackenzie, it clicl not add weight to the theory of spontaneous generation: it might have been the excited evolution of some minute vitalised ovulum, lying latent, even for ages, like the mummy wdieat of the Egyptian.</page></plain_text>
