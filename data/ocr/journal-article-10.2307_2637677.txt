JACOBS (Brown University) This article conisiders the food produtction activities of people in the Thlaping anid Tlharo chiefdcoms in the present-day Northern Cape and North-West Provinices between ci 750 and 1830. It considers food production methods, their environmental suiitability and how food produtction related to social difference. It is arguted that the Tlhaping and Tlharo chiefdoms did not arise through the migration of agro-pastoralists, but that indigenous inihabitants began stock keeping and cultivating as the chiefdoms were established in the mid-eighteenith century. Thereafter food production remained extensive anid the produicts of pastoralism - milk - provided the staple of the diet. Food production did not provide support for all people, and a significant class offoragers, who were not ethniically differentiatedfrom other mnemnbers of the chiefdons, lived at the bottom of the society and outside of the towns. It was possible for nmen to move betveen stock keeping and foraging in a process similar to the 'ecological cycle' described by Richard Elphick for the Khoisanl. However, chiefs and headnmen exerted their power, in part gained throuigh stock own1ership, to protect their positions of wealth fromn the vagaries of niatu-re and humian competitioni. Agricultutre was the most intensive utse of the environmnent and supplenmented food gained through pastoralism and foraging, rather than providing the staple. Produictioni mnethods show it had relatively low labour requiirements and may be uniderstood as shifting cultivationl. It was the responsibility of womien, who could niot achieve status throulgh their produictioni.

Every environmental zone poses challenges and opportunities to people living there, and human relations with the environment, evident in food production methods, yield rich findings for historical studies. Yet, as Elias Mandala has noted, regarding pre-colonial African societies, there has been a tendency to study relations, rather than methods, of production.' Most historians have found relations between people to be more pertinent and interesting than relations between people and their environment. However, this narrow focus has caused historians to overlook the extent to which society is shaped by the particular ways of producing in a specific environment.

It considers the identities of those engaged in these activities, and uses this evidence to discuss the significance of difference by class and gender. In the late eighteenth century the Tlhaping and Tlharo made the transition from being foragers, small stock herders and clients to being agro-pastoralists in their own right. This helps explain why food production practices remained extensive in the early nineteenth century. Foraging still provided a large proportion of the food, and people grew crops, but pastoralism was the most auspicious and the preferred use of the environment. However, pastoralism was not without its risks, and herders were in danger of becoming foragers in hard times. Men who had achieved success as herders used the political and economic power accruing to them to protect their herding interests. Reducing their risks involved exploiting the labour and produce of poorer men, to the point of maintaining a permanent class of foragers, people who were not ethnically different, but who were unable to succeed at, or who were barred from, food production. Although very dependent upon pastoralism and foraging, this was an agrro-pastoral society, and cultivation was relegated to women. In contrast to male foragers who could challenge cattle owners through an assault on power, women could not hope to control stock. A consideration of their activities in an extensive production system suggests that their exclusion from stock ownership was not a means of exploiting their agricultural labour. Rather, their practice of cultivation, the most labour-in- tensive and last-developing way of procuring food, was largely organised by women, and helped protect their households from ruin. Goat People, Fish People and Cattle Herders during 'the Bantu Expansion' and 'Proto-Difiqane' Discussion of the history of agricultural growth benefits from consideration of the work of Ester Boserup. Boserup postulated that people intensified cultivation in response to population growth, that different periods of fallow were steps on a continuum of in- tensification.4 Shortening fallow meant a larger population could be fed on the same area of land; however, accompanying the greater output per area was the need to invest more work. In relation to the amount of food produced, the labour input grew. More than her well-known argument that population is an independent variable, the corollary that people defer intensificption because of the greater work requirement is critical to this paper.5 Still, Boserup's theory does not provide a sufficient explanation for the changes in human relations with the environment. The theory deals only with cultivation, and does not 2 This prea stretches' from north-east of modern Vryburrg over Kuruman to west of Olifantshoek in present-day South Africa's Northern Cape and North-West Provinces.

It is also true that forces behind change are more complicated than the theory suggests. In history, population is not the sole determinant of land use, and Boserup gave little consideration to the ways in which environment, human culture and historic circumstances influence people's practice of food production. Yet, her observation about labour requirements and changing food production practices provides insight into the advantages and disadvantages of pastoralism, cultivation and foraging in an emerging agro-pastoral society. Pastoralism and foraging are extensive uses of land, and require less labour than even shifting cultivation. For this reason, they had an advantage over cultivation, and people whose circumstances allowed a more extensive land use had an interest in continuing it.6 This advantage helps explain the late development of agro-pastoralism. in the thornveld. This region lies at the edge of territory occupied by Bantu-speaking agro-pastoralists and at the centre of the debate about a violent transformation of the subcontinent. In the eighteenth century, this area was a frontier zone of 'the Bantu expansion', while the violent upheavals of 'the mfecane' prominently manifested themselves at the conflict at Dithakong in 1823. Regarding both phenomena, old models and terms have been questioned, and as of yet there is no consensus on the new ones. In the Kalahari thornveld the deepening chronology for 'mfecane/difiqane' to the mid-eighteenth century creates an intersection with the very late manifestation of the 'Bantu expansion' there. The evidence about these phenomena reveals how and why people undertook more intensive forms of food pro- duction. Historians' understanding of 'the Bantu expansion' has changed radically in the past few decades. The spread of Bantu languages has been traditionally considered to have been the result of human population movement. This model has been challenged by Jan Vansina.7 Vansina questioned the concept of a population replacement, emphasising instead the processes of language shift by autochthonous people. Rather than a relentless move through contiguous territory, he saw a patchy and slow spread of languages, requiring only limited immigration to introduce the new language to the existing population. Possible forces promoting Bantu languages among indigenous people included: the prestige of the immigrants' social organisation and more permanent settlements, intermarriage, demo- graphic growth, the use of Bantu language as a regional linlguta frialnca, advantages of economy, technology, military organisation, and ritual power. In this process of limited migr-ation and slow language shift, 'the largest numbers of agents were descendants of autochthons themselves'.8 This depiction of language and cultural shift is especially appropriate for the history of the Khoisan/Bantu frontier nor-th of the Orange river. Before 1800, in regions where they overlapped, there was great mingling between Khoisan and Sotho-Tswana people, whose separate linguistic and cultural heritage amounted to something less divisive than modern ethnicity. The earliest inhabitants of the northern Cape were foragrers. Archaeologists have postulated that pastoralists, possibly Khoikhoi, joined them in the Kalahari thornveld around 800 PE and that Sotho-Tswana influence from the northeast appeared in this area by the seventeenth century or earlier.9 6 The relationship between foraginig, stock keeping and cultivation varied throughoUt southern Africa. In some forested areas of southern Africa, cultivation preceded stock keeping, and the creation of tsetse-free areas through shifting cultivationi allowed people to keep animiials. M.

These findings challenge 'the subsistence dichotomy of pastoralist vs hunter - gatherer studies'.'' There has been no archaeological research into historically identifiable Tlhaping and Tlharo sites. However, Alan G. Morris has considered regional evidence from grave sites and the earliest travellers' records to hypothesise about physical and social relations. He concluded that stock-owners, no matter their language, interacted as roughly equal communities with similar values. On the other hand, both social and genetic exchanges between foraging communities and herders were more constricted.'2 The history of the Tlhaping chiefdom in the nineteenth century is familiar and well documented. However for its earlier history there are two separate historical traditions. The first, that of 'Briqua' or 'Goat People', claims that they had roots among Sotho-Tswana and Khoikhoi north of the Orange River and west of the Langeberg. The second, of 'Tlhaping' or 'Fish People' (but not necessarily congruent with the nineteenth-century chiefdom), is that they had roots among Rolong and Khoisan people near the Vaal - Harts confluence. In brief, the Goat People tradition holds that the Tlhaping chiefdom expanded into Khoisan territory, incorporated Khoisan people and retreated to the Kuruman - Vryburg region. The Fish People tradition holds that fission created a chiefdom whose leaders were Rolong, but which had allies and relatives among the Korana. The fact that the people who became the Tlhaping chiefdom were known to one set of neighbours as goat herders and the other as fish eaters is persuasive evidence that they were not agro-pastoralists on the Sotho-Tswana model. The tradition of the Goat People was the first known in the Cape Colony through information from Khoikhoi on the frontier.'3 Closer contact came in 1778 and 1779 when two separate travellers, H.J. Wikar and R.J. Gordon, encountered various Khoikhoi bands on the middle Orange River between present-day Upington and the Augrabies Falls.'4 They recorded meeting the 'Gyzikoa' (Wikar) or 'Geissiqua' (Gordon), people who had close connections with the Sotho-Tswana, known as 'Blicquoas', (Wikar) or 'Briqua' (Gordon), which meant 'Goat People' in a Khoikhoi language. Wikar recorded that Gyzikoa were a divided people, half of thein living among the Blicquoa, and the other half on the Orange River. He therefore called them the 'Twin Folk'. He attributed several characteristics of the Gyzikoa to Sotho-Tswana influences: their size, hair texture, language, karosses, metal ornaments. From them he learned the Blicquoa lived three days' journey north along a river, that they cultivated, that they kept cattle at posts in the mountains, and that they traded Footnote 9 conitinhlie(l Soutth Afticaii Ar-chaeological Butlletini, 31, 121-122 (1976), pp. 54-57; A.l.

The Gyzikoa wanted to take the travellers to the Blicquoa, but the road was without water, and Wikar's companions refused.'5 Gordon gave fewer indications that the Geissiqua exhibited Briqua culture and physiognomy, but he recorded a few Tswana words, that the Briqua had recently suffered smallpox, and that their more proper name was 'Bitjoana', the first recorded use of the name 'Tswana'. Like Wikar he noted the route to the 'Moetjoanaas', but did not journey there.'6 A scholarly expression of the Goat People tradition was developed by L.F. Maingard, who postulated diverse ethnic origins of the Tlhaping, by arguing that the Gyzikoa/Geissiqua were Tlhaping proper.'7 He noted that the Tlhaping name for the Korana, a neighbouring Khoikhoi group, was 'Bakxoto'. It uses the plural prefix, 'ba' to signify known people, as Tswana-speaking groups refeired to themselves and each other: 'Batlhaping', 'Bakwena'. In contrast, unfamiliar people, such as the Xhosa, 'Lekholkhobe' and whites, 'Lekhoa', were given the 'le' prefix. Maingard argued that the ba/le distinction was the best indication of identification, and it included the Korana as a kindred people. In addition to Wikar and Gordon, he cited nineteenth-century testimony from Tlhaping and Korana indicating that they had lived together in the eighteenth century at Nokaneng in the southwest. 18 He placed this site about half way between modern Kuruman and Upington, west of the Langeberg, on what is now a dry tributary of the Orange River, the Nokana. Although he did not seem to realise it, his hypothesis placed the settlement very close to a present-day farm of the same name, thirty kilometers southwest of Olifantshoek. A.J.B. Humphreys has used this and other evidence to argue that the limit of iron-age settlement was further southwest in 1700 than in 1800, as far as Postmasburg and Olifantshoek.'9 The second tradition, that of the Fish People, gives a different explanation for the chiefdom's roots. The first travellers from the Cape to reach Dithakong in 1801 pointed out that the people known among the Korana as 'Briqua' referred to themselves using some form of the term 'Tswana'.20 Yet, records of the 1802 Truter- Somerville expedition, did not use the name 'Tlhaping' which meant 'Fish People' in Sotho-Tswana.2' Lichtenstein, who visited in 1805-1806 was the first to observe that there were several separate 'Beetjuana' tribes, one of which was the 'Maatjaping'. 22 He gave the name 'Tlhaping' some consideration: 15 H.J.

Their rivers are full of fish. I have tried my utmost, but in vain, to find the reason for this superstition. The name Maatjaping points in that direction. According to the missionary [Jan Mathais] Kock [sic] a close relation of the name to this animal can be seen tjapi meaning fish.23 Andrew Smith later learned that 'the Batchapins used to catch fish and eat them when they were poor'. 24 Like Lichtenstein, other travellers were frustrated when they tried to learn about history. Burchell remarked: 'Their own tradition will scarcely carry their history back more than two or three generations'. 25 Campbell learned about five generations of chiefs and that the Tlhaping had resisted a Rolong attempt to collect tribute. The Tlhaping chief replied, 'Am I then your servant?' which had caused a war and scattered the people.26 Early historians of southern Africa, George Stow, George Theal and Silas Molema, slhared the belief that the Tlhaping were a vanguard of Sotho-Tswana migration, whose authenticity had diminished through mixture with the Khoisan.27 But only in the twentieth century did the tradition gain an answer for Lichtenstein's question of why the chiefdom was named 'Fish People'. The story, as presented by J.T. Brown, was that the Tlhaping broke away from the Rolong, 'moved to the banks of the Vaal river and began to use fish as part of their diet, hence their name. At and near the river they came into contact with Korana and Bushmen and intermarried with them'.28 A consolidation of the Fish People tradition appeared in the work of F.J. Language, who maintained that they were an offshoot of the Rolong and became independent under the political leadership of a talented chief.29 As a 'tribal' history, the Fish People tradition of migration and politics resembled those of scores of other groups, however, it had insufficient corroboration among the Tlhaping themselves. P.L. Breutz, the government ethnologist who did fieldwork among the southern Tswana in the late 1950s, noted: The baRolong usually say that the baTlhaping were Rolong originally, and it is very likely that they were not. It appears that certain Rolong chiefs ... merely ruled foreign Tlhaping clans. Large Tswana tribes know all about their earliest migrations, the baTlhaping do not. They therefore must have consisted of very early small isolated groups with no tradition. ... All these early populations mixed more or less with the original populations in the country, mainly related to Korana Hottentots.30 Despite distancing himself from this major part of the tradition, Breutz was not explicit on how these mixed clans became a chiefdom, and did not show scepticism about the political conflict and chiefly initiative which, the tradition maintained, created the new tribe. 23 Lichtenstein, Abolut the BechItanas, p. 66.

Before this point there were many different groups who only later consolidated as the Tlhaping.3' He made an insightful interpretation for the name 'Tlhaping': since fish was a taboo wild food among the Sotho-Tswana, the name 'Tlhaping' probably connotes very poor foragers and the term is 'more likely to be applied to a class of people than a chiefdom'. 32 Legassick used the case of the Thamaga, who became a chiefdom in their own right around the turn of the century, as evidence for earlier consolidation of the Tlhaping. They were foraging clients of the Tlhaping and their Khoisan ancestry was even more evident than that of the Tlhaping.33 By using evidence other than that collected in the tradition, Legassick gave clarity to the processes of political consolidation.34 The case against the Tlhaping existing as a Sotho-Tswana agro-pastoralist chiefdom before the mid- eighteenth century is supported by tensions and untested assumptions in the Goat People and Fish People traditions. The tension is between the account of an early established Tswana chiefdom and ethnic diversity. The untested assumption is of migration. Yet, recognising these problems, the traditions reveal cultural homogenisation as well as political transformation. Early nineteenth century travellers do not record ethnic diversity among the Tlhaping at Dithakong. As we shall see, the foragers in this society were not typically identified as 'Bushmen', and since these same travellers had encountered 'Bushmen' in other areas, their absence is indicative. The Korana were in the region, and remained there throughout the century. However, relations between them and the Tlhaping had changed. At Nokaneng there had been a Korana community, but at Dithakong, there were 'Beetjuanas' who understood the Korana language.35 This has been explained by the collapse of an alliance,36 but it also reflects cultural homogenisation within the chiefdom. In the early nineteenth century, there was still frequent intermarriage between Tlhaping and Korana, the brides joining their husband's people. How Korana women conformed to Sotho-Tswana custom and became cultivators is not explained, but the specific practices of cultivation suggest that adaptation was manageable. The political consolidation of the chiefdom meant that Sotho-Tswana agro-pastoralism became the model for the dominant class, and this gave the language and production methods hegemonic value throughout the territory. Consolida- tion in one terr itory also could have weakened Sotho-Tswana presence outside its 3 1 M.

In fact, a mirror image of this cultural homogenisation must have been taking place among the Korana who were incor-porating Sotho-Tswana clients.37 Therefore, Humphreys' hypothesis of retreating iron-age settlement might be better understood as communities on both sides of a frontier consolidating and conforming to cultural standards. Critically read, both the Goat People and the Fish People traditions support Vansina's argument for cultural and language shift among indigenous people rather than population expansion by Bantu groups. Ironically, where the earliest historians took Khoisan influence among the Tlhaping as an indication that they were a senior, albeit degraded, Tswana tribe, the same evidence is used here to maintain that this was a young chiefdom, still coming into conformity with Sotho-Tswana patterns. Historians on all sides of the debates over the events formerly known as the mfecane, recognise that a transformation occurred in this region, and in southern Africa in general. Recent rethinking of the mfecane has extended explanations for the violence far beyond the traditional one which centred on the immediately preceding decade in just one location, KwaZulu-Natal. Even before the rethinking, the late eighteenth century was recognised to be a period of change.38 Neil Parsons and Andrew Manson have sought to link the causes of the conflict and political change in the region before 1820 with those of the spectacular conflict after that date. In fact, Parsons has described the period after 1750 as 'the proto-difiqane'. 39 The endemic stock raiding of this period is the most obvious link between the establishment of independent agro-pastoralism and the increase in violence.40 Plundering herds was the 'principal object' of warfare.41 Tlhaping raids lasted as long as five months, and went as far as 'the Great Water'.42 Sometime between 1770 and 1790 a Tlhaping and Korana raiding party attacked the Tswana chiefdom to the north, the Ngwaketse, who remembered that battle as one with 'Barwa' or 'southerners', a term which has come to signify the San but may have once applied to poor foragers of any origin.43 Through raiding, stock-poor people could establish themselves as a chiefdom, as the case of the Thamaga shows: They formed a considerable body in the days of Molehabangue ... who, in his commandoes for the capture of cattle, was wont to take them with him. Taught this mode of warfare, and being of an intrepid character, they sallied forth and took cattle for themselves, which Moleha- bangue's generous disposition allowed them to keep, and they became an independent tribe.4 By all accounts, the Thamaga were formidable raiders.45 John Campbell was disturbed to discover apathy about the ubiquity of raiding violence: 'A Matchappee, being told that cows, oxen, sheep, and other animals were made for certain purposes, such as to feed and clothe men, was asked for what purpose he thought man was made.

The Korana - Tlhaping community at Nokaneng dissolved under Korana attacks around that time and the Tlhaping moved north eastward.47 Raiders seized people as well as cattle, as we will see. Tlhaping society had two types of poor clients: batlhanka taken as captives in raids, and balala who lost their wealth, often to raiders. However, by now captives also went to the Cape. The worst violence in the 1810s and 1820s was by the Bergenaars, miscreant breakaway Griqua in the Langeberg.48 This violence shows continuity between the late eighteenth and early nine- teenth centuries, and explains one means by which the new chiefdoms obtained their wealth. One factor identified for the violence during the early nineteenth century is a food shortage. This has been attributed to population growth, drought after the 1790s or land shortage due to immigration from the south.49 Explanations of food crisis appear in several decades, even before the period when the Tlhaping and Tlharo consolidated. As with many 'agricultural revolutions' we have no direct evidence here for why people came to rely more on agro-pastoralism than foraging. The first probable reason is standard: as populations grew, increasing demand on wild food resources made them insufficient. There is no record of factors that might have spuiTed demographic growth, necessitating more intensive land use along Boserup's model. Neither is there evidence for a failure of existing ways of procuring food, requiring innovation. However, immigration by Griqua and Korana did constrict the territory of the emerging chiefdoms, which may have created pressure.50 Another development related to the violence and political consolidation is an increase in, and redirection of, long distance trade. Long distance trade had previously existed to Sotho-Tswana people in the east. The 1778 account by Wikar reveals how the Tlhaping acquired cattle through a varied trade of ivory, locally mined specularite, as well as iron, copper and tobacco and beads acquired from the east.51 By 1800, trade, particularly of ivory, had begun with the Griqua and Korana, although it did not eclipse the older trade in importance until after 1820.52 In return for their exchanges with the Cape, the Tlhaping acquired beads, which they traded with other groups for additional cattle.53 The new trade did not benefit all, and already in the eighteenth century raiders were trading Tlhaping captives and cattle to the Cape.54 The new trading opportunities increased wealth in the hands of the chiefs, who then attracted more followers, contributing to the establishment of towns.55 Threats of raiding and violence also brought people closer to the chief and town.56 Because food production revolved around them, the growth of towns made a greater relianice on agro-pastoralism likely. Perhaps towns made food production prestigious. Also, the founding of the towns brought people who had previously not grown crops or spoken a Bantu dialect into the 46 Campbell, TDravels, p. 186.

Before the mid-eighteenth century, people had been small-stock pastoralists and clients to agro-pastoralists; they had experience of agro-pastoralism before practicing it indepen- dently. They were not ignorant about food production, and there was no significant migration of food producers to introduce the practice. Specific historical forces caused people to turn from pastoral-foraging and to become agro-pastoralists in the half century before 1800. In the process they became the Tlhaping and Tlharo, and they were cattle owners by 1778, when Wikar heard about their herds at posts in the mountains.57 Yet animals were like those found in Khoikhoi herds, rather than a Tswana breed.58 The transformation to the Sotho-Tswana agro-pastoral model was not as complete as among groups that experienced it earlier. Even by the 1820s they had not developed intensive land use. In later years, the Tlhaping remembered that 'they had never been so rich nor so numerous' as they were under the rule of Molehabangwe, the ruler encountered by the first travellers to Dithakong in 1801.59 However, the people who remembered being rich did not speak for everyone. Documentary evidence left by travellers and missionaries after 1801 reveals that food production did not provide support for all people in this society. The Balala and the Ecological Cycle That food production was not high yielding is evident in the existence of a Tswana foraging class, the balala. However, the existence of the balala as a genuine and significant part of this society must be established. At times the non-aristocratic population of Tswana chiefdoms have been depicted as unstratified and secure food producers.60 When the poor do attract historical attention they are not considered to be integral in Tswana society.61 There has been an assumption that lower, foraging classes resulted from outside factors. The most common explanation for the poor is that they were ethnic outsiders, such as the San and the Kgalagadi, which holds true for northern Tswana areas later in the century, but may not be assumed for this region and period, where there was no association between poverty and ethnic difference.62 Another tendency has been to argue that stratification arose 57 Wikar, The Joiurncal, p. 155. 58 Lichtenstein, Aboutt tlhe Becultiana(is. pp. 80-81.

However, stratification chiefly mani- fested itself in the way people organised around stock ownership, a form of food production, and must be studied in that context. In contrast to the emphasis on outside forces, John Iliffe's study, The Africanl Poor argues that poor people were an integral part of Tswana societies: 'The structural poor of nineteenth-century Tswana society were a complex stratum and perhaps an unusually large one by African standards', and 'the whole process of Tswana history, with groups repeatedly incorporated in subordinate capacities, suggests recurrent disaster and desti- tution'.64 This observation about 'recurrent disaster and destitution', is reminiscent of Richard Elphick's theory of ecological cycle. Elphick devised the theory of the ecological cycle to describe a class-based dynamic between Khoisan herders and foragers in the western Cape. The linguistic and archeological evidence indicates that the Khoikhoi were originally an offshoot of one bushman group who adopted cattle in the first millennium BPE, but no insurmountable gulf arose between pastoralists and foragers. As Khoikhoi people spread in search of new grazing, they incorporated foragers as hunting clients, herders and wives. But not all Khoikhoi were equally successful as herders, and foraging continued among them as a low-prestige activity.65 The upward phase of the ecological cycle involved foragers acquiring stock through work as clients or raiding. Conversely, the cycle had a downward phase, for Khoikhoi who lost their herds through ostracism by their band, warfare, or disease could assume the life of foragers, becoming bushmen. Elphick hesitated to apply the ecological cycle to agro-pastoral societies. He cautioned: Here the Khoikhoi experience conti-asted sharply with that of most eastern and southern African peoples, who combined a ritual and emotional attachment to pastoralism with an economic reliance oIn cultivation. In Southern Bantu society, for example, all persons have the right to use a section of tribal land, even though the actual distribution of the land rests in the hands of the chief. Thus, though individuals and lineages may be poor in stock, they rarely starve unless the whole community is starving with them. The Khoikhoi approach to wealth was by contrast individualistic, fortune was unstable, and the gap between rich and poor could be very pronounced.66 Other historians seem to have been convinced by this caveat; there has been no evident attempt to extend his analysis to agro-pastoral societies. This m ay be because of lingering misconceptions about the efficacy of cultivation and the egalitarianism of agro-pastoral societies, apparent in the quotation from Elphick above. More recent historical research has shown that food productioni in Sotho-Tswana societies in the early nineteenth century did not provide adequate support to all people, and that certain groups, womenl, children and poor people, suffered disproportionately.67 Despite Elphick's hesitation, the concept of the ecological cycle can provide a starting point for examining the relations between those who had enough food and those who did not, between foraging and food-producing people in the same society. 63 G.

Wild plant food consisted of roots and fruits, especially *noretlhwa from the raisin tree (Grewia flava). Roots of the inotlope or shepherds' tree or witgatboom (Boscia albitrunica) yielded a sweet coffee-like beverage when boiled, and tamma, the boiled root of the gemsbuck beans (Tylosemna esculeiituin), was a staple at certain times of the year. Also, swarms of grasshoppers, boiled and pounded into a powder, provided food.68 There are many other wild plant foods not specifically mentioned in the earliest accounts which are indigenous to the northern Cape province; one study lists over fifty roots, tubers, seeds, flower, fruits, berries and leaves with many uses as staples, hunger foods, relishes, and beverages.69 While the Tlhaping ate fish only during a crisis, game was relished, and probably provided more meat than flocks and herds did. Game consisted of large and small antelope, Cape buffalo, wild birds, and hares, giraffe and zebra.70 The chief organised grand hunts with hundreds of participants armed with knobkerries, assegais and pitfalls. Households with flocks and fields supplemented their diets with veldkos and game, but contemporary observers describe an underclass who were not able to produce enough for themselves, the balala. The term most likely derives from the Tswana verb 'to lie down', and means 'low ones', or 'those who have been laid low'.71 The balala were a class of ethnically Tswana full-time foragers, differentiated by lacking the ability to produce food.72 Robert Moffat, a missionary with long experience, claimed the balala: 'live a hungry life, being dependent on the chase, wild roots, berries, locusts and indeed anything eatable that comes within their reach'.73 Lichtenstein observed 'the poorer people live practically on a vegetarian diet'.74 The process which reduced balala to these circumstances is similar to that described by Elphick's ecological cycle. We can cite individual examples of agro-pastoralists being reduced to hunting and gathering: one man was impoverished because of 'measles'. He lost a great many cattle ... and became a poor man, which obliged him for some time to live among the wild bushmen, in order to obtain subsistence'. This man later recouped his wealth in raids against neighbouring people.75 In another case, a man suffered during Korana raids on Tlhaping herds. He recalled that the entire population had dispersed from towns and foraged to survive.76 The case of a girl, 'almost a skeleton', was different, for rather than generalised disasters, a breakdown of the producing household reduced her and her mother to poverty: her father had gone away with another woman, reducing the mother 68 OIi wild foods, see Burchell, Travels in the Inite-ior-, 2, p. 415: Campbell, SeconidJolur-niey, 2, p. 217; G.

They were reduced to foraging, 'and in this employment, it was unnecessary for them to say, that they had not lately been very successful'.79 Moffat seems to have recognised something akin to the ecological cycle, explaining that the ba/ala had once lived in towns but now lived 'in the same relation to the Bechuanas in which the Bushmen formerly stood to the Hottentots'.80 John Campbell used the telling term: 'Bootchuana Bushmen'.81 The balala were differentiated from the class of 'vassals', the batlhanka, who were usually taken as prisoners in raids and lived as serfs. There was a fine and sometimes loose distinction between balala and batlhanka. 82 Using the singular forms with the 'mo' rather than the plural 'ba' prefix, Burchell explained: 'the word molala signifies a person who is possessed of little, and is used as a common appellative for a servant or attendant. The name Munchunka has nearly the same signification but implies a lower rank'.83 It does not seem to have been part of the original position of batlhanika that they were saleable property, but as the market for slaves developed, they were traded.84 What Eldredge noted about the existence of bartl/hanka, that it 'made these societies vulnerable to being drawn into a wider network of slave trading linked to European expansion', is certainly true of the balala as well.85 Like women and children, they were certainly vulnerable and more likely to be traded to the Cape as slaves. Unlike cattle owners, they did not have the means to redeem captured family members.86 The similarity between balala and batlhanka would have been clear at the height of the violence of the 1820s, when there were more balala. The Tlhaping abandoned the capital during a severe drought in 1829, to look for food.87 Violence caused the Tlharo to lose cattle, fields and homes.88 Some of these people who scattered as balala no doubt were also captured as batlhanika and sold to the Cape. Both of these lower classes were more vulnerable to starvation than was the community as a whole. The missionary Philip's depiction may be extreme, but his general points are corroborated by other evidence. He writes that: Such was the state of wretchedness to which many of Mateebe's people were reduced, that Mr. Gleig remarked, that although he had seen many famines in India, he had never seen the effect of famine in such a manner as he had witnessed at Lattakoo [Dithakong]. Many of the common people were literally walking skeletons; and those among them who were in possession of cattle, were really passing such of their neighbours as were perishing among the bushes, with the leaves in their mouths, with as much indifference as if they had been so many dogs. 89 Begging was common, from neighbours and also from travellers and missionaries (even by people who were not particularly needy). Outsiders noted that begging often did not yield 77 Campbell, Travels, p. 194. 78 Burchell, 2, Travels in the Iite-ior, p. 249. 79 Burchell, 2, Travels in the Iite-ior, p. 216. 80 Moffat, Missionary Labours, p. 8 81 For an example, see Campbell, Secondl Journey, 1, pp. 288-289. 82 Lichtenstein was first to use a form of the term batlhanika, but he did not mention the btlala.

Some masters allowed 'a scanty portion of food or milk and leave them to make up the deficiency by hunting or digging up wild roots'.91 Foraging did not provide abundance, but was necessary for the poor's survival. Under certain conditions, foraging can be an ideal way to procure food. True, there was little surplus, and there were risks of hungry periods, but converting wild plants and animals into food required less time spent in labour than managing domesticated plants and animals did. Despite these advantages, foraging was not sufficient. There were not enough wild foods to support all the people all the time. Also, as the case of the Fish People shows, foragers were often prey to exploitation by stock owners. The emphasis on the foraging and the lower classes here is not meant to suggest that the balala necessarily made up a large proportion of the population. The crucial issue is not their numbers but that they were genuinely part of this society, and that full-time foraging was the recourse of the poor. Pastoralism: a Propitious Food Source Under such pressure, managing herds was the most auspicious way humans interacted with the thornveld. Reliance on herding over foraging was a step of intensification, but it was still a relatively extensive land use. Herding required less labour than cultivation, but provided for the same number of people on a smaller area than foraging could. Grazers and browsers consumed the grasses and bushes that grow naturally under the low rainfall, and converted the vegetation into a relatively reliable source of food. Their value was enhanced because they were mobile during drought, disease or raiding. They reproduced themselves without assistance and required only herding from humans. Furthermore, pastoralism was a level of intensification appropriate to population. Because the area was lightly populated, people in towns could rely on huge expanses for herding. Herding was well suited, but was not the only way people obtained food. What proportion of calories pastoralism provided in the diet is difficult to state, and such a question can only be answered with reference to social category. Domestic stock did not provide much meat, however. Many travellers testified that the 'principal food' was milk; people usually drank it curdled, or cooked sorghum and beans in it to make porridge.92 Therefore, it absolutely undervalues the practical importance of pastoralism to designate its contribution as a 'ritual diet' or as supporting social rather than physical reproduction.93 However, the significance of pastoralism did go beyond dietary contribution. Cattle had the greatest cultural and political significance, although they were probably not the most productive domesticated animals. The Tlhaping (Goat People, after all) had many more goats and paid high prices for sheep.94 Despite this, Tlhaping men who owned stock treasured cattle most of all. Records from the 1801 Truter - Somerville expedition stress this point strongly. One account described the scene of stock returning to the kraal at night, 90 Lichtenstein, Travels, 2, p. 365; D.

One man reportedly spoke for nearly an hour in praise of his cattle.95 Another record of the trip states that in a song about cattle 'the fortune of those who possessed such treasure was compared with the misery of those who were destitute'. 96 The accumulation of cattle, more than the practice of cultivation, marked the transformation of Fish and Goat People into a Sotho-Tswana chiefdom, and allowed individual men to develop power and influence. The Comaroffs are right to state that cattle are at the centre of Tswana society, that they have a symbolic and ideological value as the essence of socialised life.97 The way their acquisition transformed society explains why this is so. Stock owners scattered their animals across huge areas, keeping stock at many posts which sent leather bags filled with milk to people in town.98 The posts could possibly be several days journey from town.99 Stock owners' sons and client herders lived at the posts to care for the cattle, the sons in a managerial role.'00 There were also client families at cattle posts,'0' and boys certainly helped watch animals, but there were cultural sanctions against women having close contact with cattle. Watching herds is not arduous work and one herder can take care of a large number of animals successfully. If animals wandered, it was time consuming to search for them, but some were trained to return to a call.'02 In case of attack by predators, human or animal, more herders were helpful, but increasing the numbers to protect animals might not be sufficient to control risk. Although it was a propitious and preferred use of the environment, there were difficulties and risks in this system of herding. First, there were not great production surpluses. The Truter - Somerville expedition contacted the Tlhaping with hopes of trading for their cattle but was disappointed. As Somerville reported, No endeavour has succeeded in procuring for purchase a single milk cow. ... But the Chief declared that there were really not cows enough to give milk for the maintainance [sic] of his people, and that the few quarts he daily sent us was felt, which may be readily conceived when it is considered that betweeni 7 and 8000 people are maintained principally upon milk.'03 The tight supply may have resulted from low production per cow,'04 or from a shortage of animals, which was Somerville's understanding: 'The number of cattle possessed by the inhabitants of Litakone [Dithakong] is very far from being great compared with that of their owners - and the fact I believe truly to be that they have sense enough to value their oxen more than beads, knives or any of the baubles offered in exchange for them'.'05 Numbers grew slowly, because cattle reproduce more slowly than small stock, and suffered more from disease. In fact, the two endemic environmental stock diseases in the area, anthrax and bovine botulism, worsen as herd populations grow, and one or both posed challenges to Tlhaping herders in this period.'06 Environmental conditions in the Tlhaping pastures at 95 Borcherds, An AlutoBiographzical Memoir, p. 126.

Because animals grazed on naturally growing grass and bushes only, the chiefdom required large areas for enough food for flocks and herds. These extensive uses of land opened herds up to attack from raiders. As Lichtenstein learned in a conversation with Chief Molehabangwe: We found the cattle all very lean: this the king said was owing to the treacherous conduct of Makkraki [a Rolong chief] which constrained him to keep them in the neighbourhood, lest they should all be stolen, the consequence was, that all the fields near were eaten quite bare, and scarcely any means of subsistence now remained for the cattle.'09 So, gathering animals to protect them put stress on the grass supply, and also raised mortality and lowered milk production. Last, the grass supply and therefore stock keeping was affected by drought."0 Consequently, there was competition between herders for grass and water."' In short, flocks and herds had great practical and symbolic value; yet herders faced constraints in keeping them, and this strain sustained a competitive politics of stock keeping. Chiefly Privilege, Herding Clients and Intervention into the Ecological Cycle Although the Tswana were reliant on extensive land uses, they lived in settlements where large populations were concentrated. These places could be very large: travellers in the early nineteenth century compared the Tlhaping capital in size with Cape Town."2 The Comaroffs maintain the town was 'a centralized polity, one in which distinctly unequal classes enjoyed very different access to the means of production and redistribution'."3 The chief had particular rights over townspeople: the right to demand tributary labour, the right to organise cattle raids and grand hunts and claim most spoils; the right to claim a portion of ivory, hides and feathers captured in other hunts; rights to the brisket of all meat, known as 'sehuba' (Tswana for chest); and the right to levy fines.' '4 With his wealth in cattle, the chief could provide bridewealth for many wives, who laboured in fields and bore children, who provided more labour, and if they were girls, more cattle when they married. He could also attract clients, and thus increase his prestige and wealth. Chiefship brought added wealth to men who were already rich. In fact, a chief who was not the richest man in the community was in a precarious position."'5 107 Somerville, William Somer-ville's Narrative, p. 139. 108 Testimony of Mahura's son Masse, Evidence Takeni at Bloemlhof, pp. 61-62.

Women waited for the chief to open the agricultural season. Evidence from other Tswana societies shows that they brought the first of the harvest to his court for the first fruits ceremony to open the harvest season.16 Also, he was responsible for providing rain for the crops."7 Not only the living chief, but chiefly ancestors protected rain, fertility and reproduction of stock and the success of the hunt." 8 The richest man at the centre of the society defined by its agro-pastoralism, the chief was most removed from the foraging past, and he and his ancestors embodied the ability to succeed as herders and cultivators. Town households interacted at the level of the ward, an administrative, spatial and social unit. The traveller, William Burchell, hinted that the genesis of a ward may have started with a successful man consolidating his position. 'Each chieftain or kosi [kgosi, "chief'] pitches his house on a separate spot, while all his friends or dependants build theirs around him'."19 These separate wards remained strong, and rich men could challenge the paramount chief by breaking away with their followers.'20 There were few people capable of attracting clients, as the missionary Campbell noted: 'All independent persons, or such as have cattle sufficient to support their families, are captains, or rank as such, though only one in a district be really so'.'2' Burchell believed all dependants were 'in fact, the unpaid servants of either the chief or of the various chieftains'. 122 Estimates of ward size are impressionistic, but they provide a rough indication of the size of a headman's retinue. In 1812, Burchell estimated Dithakong had about 5,000 people divided into 30 or 40 wards.'23 Campbell estimated in 1813 that the Tlhaping capital had 7,500 people in 50 wards.'24 On his 1820 trip, he reported a Tlharo town had about 1,000 people in seven wards.'25 There was great variation, but these estimates allow a rough guess that the average ward size may have been around 150 people. Not everyone below the headman was impoverished, but there was a great difference between rich and poor: 'One man alone will sometimes be the owner of eight or ten considerable herds'.'26 An important interaction between chiefs, headmen and their clients revolved around the care of cattle. Rich men needed assistance with herding. Their first choice was to use their sons, but as they aged and herds grew, the fathers required further help. Also, it reduced risk and labour to scatter their animals among many herders across different pastures. On the other side, poor but ambitious men needed to build herds. These requirements encouraged men of different households to come together in mafisa relationships, which involved the transfer of one or two young heifers from a rich man to a poorer one: 'The care of cattle is entrusted to poor people who have none of their own. Such people are hired by the wealthy cattle owners who give them food and a small part of the annual profit;' and 'A poor Beetjuana with one wife and half a dozen head of cattle seeks the protection of a richer one. He adds his few oxen to the large herd of the rich one and for a share in the "profit" he serves as a herdsman.'"27 The receiver cared for a cow and kept it for several years, consuming all its milk. During that time, he had obligations to assist the cattle owner 116 Campbell, Seconid Jolurney, 2, p. 154. 117 J. Comaroff, Body of Powe-, pp. 66-67. 118 W.C.

Given the brake on milk production and stock reproduction, even rich owners were concerned to maintain the viability of their herds. Also, they were concerned to keep others from accumulating stock and a power base, so reciprocal herding did not always allow poorer herders to accumulate herds, as Burchell's testimony regarding mafisa under chief Mothibi, Molehabangwe's son, attests: Mattivi possesses numerous herds of cattle; these are pastured in various parts of the country, and furnish employment for a considerable number of the poorer class of his people. They receive for their service, nothing more than mere sustenance, and, as it would appear, barely that; being allowed only a certain portion of the milk, and left to supply themselves with meat by occasional hunting.'29 The distinction between milk and stock as the payment for herding is critical. Milk provided calories, but a heifer provided the means to build a herd, and independence. Chiefly interventions into mafisa are reminiscent of the kgamelo system that developed between 1817 and 1828 among the Ngwato under chief Kgari.130 This class of the inhabitants is greatly oppressed, not only by a despotic, but by an aristocratic power also; for, that authority which the chief exercises over the kosies or richer order, these exercise over their servants and immediate dependants, to so unjust a degree that they will not suffer them to acquire any property whatever; and should any of this ill-fated class become, by means however honest, possessed of a cow or a few goats, he would be a rare instance of good fortune or favour, if his master did not take them from him. This tyrannical conduct the kosi would justify by telling him that a muchunka or mollala (poor man or servant) had no need of cattle, as he had only to mind his duty in attending those of his superior, and he might always be certain of receiving as much milk and food as would be necessary for his support.'31 According to Moffat, the balala were not allowed to keep cattle.132 Years later, another missionary elaborated on these rights: 'The chief's control over the property of his subjects, is further shown by the fact that no man, however high his position in the tribe, may remove his cattle to go to live under another chief.133 If the herder had no cattle and did receive significant milk and food, mafisa arrangements were beneficial to both. However, Burchell explained, 'The chief will always be the richest man; for once arrived at supreme authority he holds within his own hands the power of obtaining property'. 'The poor', he noted, 'are always kept poor; and if I may judge by appearances, there are many of that description'.134 In addition to the difficulties in accumulating stock, balala and batlhanka experienced other hardships. There is evidence that poor classes could be victims of exceptional violence.135 Consider the case of a man who stole cattle: too poor to make the restitution required by law, he was therefore put to death.136 Moffat considered the lives of the balala 'miserable, because if found deviating in the least from the tyrannical laws of their chief they have often in an unwary moment to forfeit their lives'.137 Still, the demands of serfdom 128 On mafisa relationships in Botswana, see I.

Masters demanded some wild products, including berries, meat and skins for karosses.'38 It was possible, however, at least when they acted as a group, for clients to challenge domination, as the cases of the Fish People and the Thamaga show. The power exerted by the chief and headmen to maintain their position shows that the theory of the ecological cycle as such is not adequate to describe relations between cattle owners and client herders and foragers. As identified by Elphick, the ecological cycle was powered by individual men negotiating hostile and benevolent forces: competition and good fortune, victory or defeat, drought, disease and the reproductive capacity of stock. The same processes of destitution and accumulation were also evident among the Tlhaping and Tlharo. However, evidence about Tswana herders in the thornveld raises questions about whether it is appropriate to characterise these processes as a cycle and to identify the ecology as the primary force behind them. Class difference did not result only from a two-way interaction between people and nature; rather, successful men exerted their power to protect themselves from the vagaries of the ecological cycle, and this entailed keeping underlings at a disadvantage. The need to minimise risk and procure labour, and also the desire for status and power through the accumulation of animals motivated the rich to perpetuate clientship. Expropriation of stock, under-remuneration in mafisa relations, tribute requirements, violence and forced labour were protective measures erected by the rich and powerful. These interventions impeded their descent or others' ascent through a cycle fuelled through individual effort, environmental possibility and chance. The history of male society in the early nineteenth century contains much evidence for poverty, stratification, clientship and dependence rather than reciprocal egalitarianism. Fortune or impoverishment hung upon the successful management of cattle, the most efficacious use of the semi-arid thornveld. Accumulating herds brought wealth and power, while losing them reduced a man to the foraging balala class, to be a Tswana bushman. However, this particular interaction between people, animals and the environment was limited to men. Women in southern African agro-pastoral societies were excluded from the opportunities of cattle herding and worked as cultivators instead. The assertion that social relations become clearer when studied in the context of food production methods will only have merit if it also can explain the activities of cultivators and the position of women. The place of women and the role of cultivation need to be considered, as the most intensive form of food production practised in this society, by people excluded both from stock ownership and political power. Shifting Cultivation in a Semi-arid Zone Women's lower position in society corresponded to cultivation, which was less efficacious than stock keeping and did not provide wealth or influence. Of the ways of procuring food, cultivation was the most intensive use of land and most consuming of human effort, but the labour involved was lower than has been assumed. According to the argument that people intensify production when conditions force them to do so, the Tlhaping and Tlharo cultivated because the older forms of food production, pastoralism and foraging, did not provide sufficient food. Women's methods were not particularly arduous, and the practice increased available calories while giving them more control over food. In contrast to the balala who could become stock owners, women had no possibility of herding. They were 138 Moffat, Missioniary Laboutrs, p. 8. Campbell, Seconid Journ"ey, 2, p. 167.</page><page sequence="20">366 Jouirnal of Southern Africani Studies excluded from power and pastoralism, but cultivation appears to have been their response to the need for food, not an activity dictated by male pastoralists. Shifting cultivation, as explained by Boserup, is sparing in use of labour rather than land. Fields are partially cleared with fire and an axe, rather than painstakingly weeded. The undisturbed soil will have fewer weeds than regularly used plots, so only light hoeing is necessary. Fertility is provided by the natural vegetation, and burning it releases minerals to enrich the soil. Therefore the labour of applying fertiliser is avoided. Such farming requires little investment in making or purchasing tools. It does require large land areas, for when fertility drops and weeds increase, cultivators move to new plots, and clear them along the same lines. According to Boserup, shifting cultivators might clear a new plot every year, or every ten years. The fields can lay fallow for 25 years or more, before cultivators return to them, and clear them as practically virgin land. Boserup maintains that in such a system most working days consists of a few hours of labour, and there are many days with no work in fields at all.'39 Abundant evidence on the history of cultivation among the Tlhaping justifies discussing it as extensive shifting cultivation. The eighteenth century history of the Tlhaping suggests that cultivation was a recent development. It is highly unlikely that their Khoisan ancestors cultivated. According to Wikar and Gordon, the Briqua were cultivators, but this might describe Tswana people in general, not just those at Nokaneng, where, because of the extremely low rainfall, it is doubtful that much cultivation took place. From the 1790s to 1829 the Tlhaping capital moved around the upper valleys of the Kuruman and Moshaweng Rivers, where rainfall was still uncertain in some years, but cultivation did become part of the compliment of food production practices.'40 The extensive nature of cultivation is also evident in the low value placed on land. The chief was responsible for granting fields. It is generally held that the chief gave land to men, but perhaps men considered their wives to be the owners of household fields.'4' Cultivators did not take great pains to demarcate their boundaries.'42Burchell noted: 'In fact, with respect to territory, they have none of those ideas which a European would attach to the word. The soil never appears to be considered as property, nor is it hardly ever thought worth claiming or disputing the possession of: the water and pasturage of it, is all that is rated of any value; and when these are exhausted the soil is abandoned as useless."43 This assertion that water was more valuable than land held true as some later travellers found getting access to water sources was difficult.'44 Other evidence that this was a very extensive form of cultivation is that it did not produce great surplus. Burchell reported: The pursuit of agriculture though deemed by them of high importance, is not however, carried so far as to push the nation in a state of plenty ... to fill up this deficiency, and escape starvation, or at least to mitigate their daily hunger, they are reduced to the necessity of searching the plains for those wild roots which nature offers.'45 The logic of extensive food production reverses the relationship suggested by Burchell; 139 Boserup, The Conditionis, pp. 15-16, 28-31, 44-48. 140 Somerville, William Somlerville's Nar-rative, p. 142. 141 Campbell, Second Journ7ley, 2, pp. 148-149. 142 Somerville, William Somerville's Narr-ative, p. 129.

Many observers noted that in general, people did not have a bountiful diet, and that the Tlhaping ate lots when food was available. Missionaries put this down to gluttony,'46 but it made sense under conditions of low production, as long as enthusiastic eating did not threaten the future food supply, and Moffat suggested this was the case. 'They have been accustomed to habits of industry and economy from their early years and would find means of living where others would starve, and I believe they would rather die of hunger than eat the seeds of grain intended for next year's sowing'.'47 The Tlhaping recognised such cultivation was suited to their needs, showing interest in, but eschewing the use of the plough. In 1801, Chief Molehabangwe showed resistance to the threat that missionaries might interfere with familiar ways, including cultivation. His impression was that missionaries allowed people to be idle, and 'as the Bootshuanas were very numerous, a life of idleness would not suit them'.'48 Perhaps this attitude encouraged Kok and Edwards, the missionaries arriving in 1801, to give practical aid as well as Christian instruction. In fact, Lichtenstein reported that Molehabangwe esteemed Kok for teaching new techniques of cultivation.'49 But Kok made himself useful in many ways, including shooting game and trading. He did not plough enough food even to feed his family and by no means did he convert the Tlhaping to plough cultivation before his murder in 1806.150 The towns were surrounded by cultivated fields, large enough to 'amaze' Khoikhoi visitors.151 Somerville, who had more experience of cultivation, stated that the fields were three to four miles across, but did not think the plots given to each family were very large.'52 Continuing his observation on the short supply of milch cows, he explained 'for the land cultivated is only great, when compared with the means by which labour is performed'.'53 Somerville did not realise that a cultivation system with rudimentary technology required less labour than the ploughs with which he was more familiar. The simple system also explains how Khoikhoi women marrying into the Tlhaping could soon adjust to the practice. The main tool for clearing and preparing the fields was a hoe: 'A flat piece of iron fixed into the knob of the Kaffer keerrie. When its horizontal edge is so fitted that it stands at right angles with the handles, it serves as a hoe; when turned round so as to be parallel with the handle, it is then a hatchet."54 The hoe sufficed because fire helped clear fields and not all natural vegetation was removed. They applied no dung, but burned fields before using them.'55 Brush and trees reduced the amount of grain produced on any plot, but leaving them reduced labour as well.'56 Since the veld type was an open savanna, clearing fields was not as large a task as in forested regions. Tree removal was not only for convenience of cultivation but also to remove bird habitat and for fencing and fuel.

In fact, Moffat gave the Tlhaping notoriety as 'a nation of levellers'.157 Short uses of each plot further reduced labour. Weeds and grasses increase in successive years of cultivation and shifting cultivators avoid this problem by moving to new plots. Somerville suggested plots were used for only one year, but his visit was not long enough to ascertain this.158 We know they prepared new fields at least as often as towns moved, six times at an average of every four and one-half years between 1800 and 1827.159 In choosing fields, they avoided rocky places and may have preferred sowing in less dry SpotS.1601t is possible that soil exhaustion was a chief reasons for the frequent town movement. To prepare the fields women 'scratched a few inches deep'.161 Sowing took place after the first rains, which could come as early as November or not at all. People broadcast their seed, beans, pumpkins, squash, melons, sweet reed and sorghum, in the same field.162 The next step was hoeing for weeds, a month after sowing.163 The greatest labour of the season came just before harvest: protecting the crops, especially sorghum, from birds.164Melons and beans came into harvest before sorghum. Threshing and winnowing were the last tasks, and then grains and beans were stored in clay granaries.165 Cultivation complimented pastoralism and foraging as the most labour- and land- intensive activity within an extensive food procurement system. Seeing it in the context of its particular methods, the practice of pastoralism and foraging, and the social relations connected to them, will help us understand the different experiences of men and women and the position of women in society as a whole. Women, Reciprocity, Cultivation and Reproduction As Elphick's hesitancy to apply the theory of the ecological cycle to agro-pastoral societies illustrates, cultivation is considered to be the less individualistic sector of the agro-pastoral economy. The reputation for greater levels of co-operation extends to the cultivators - women. Discussing the southern Tswana, Margaret Kinsman contrasted individualistic male pastoralism with female cultivation and co-operation. For Kinsman the association became: women - communal - subordinate, and men - individualistic - independent, and commu- nalism became one cause of women's subordination.166 It is true that women were not as competitive as men were, yet their work was not communal, and co-operation is not a cause 157 Moffat, Missionary Labours, pp. 330-331.

Helpful here is the observation by John and Jean Comaroff that competition was associated with agnation, and co-operation with matrilateral linkages. Male politics and competition were expressed in terms of agnation, but matrilaterality allowed men support. Women were not able to act in agnatic, political arenas, but were restricted to a marginal more co-operative domain, which was less auspicious than pastoralism.'67 Yet, they did not operate only as subordinates in a manner entirely contrary to the sector of men and herding. An analysis of humans and their efforts to provide for themselves in a particular environment should explain how these activities differed by gender rather than the role played by women in a male-dominated society.'68 Unlike pastoralism, there was no benefit in competitive relations in cultivation. Yet, it is important to recognise that it was based upon reciprocal exchange, rather than true communalism, between women. Separate households were drawn to share labour because it was more efficient than working alone. Because women had different strengths, being speedy weeders, hoers or harvesters, working together on the many tasks evened out work time.169 A woman could draw on the labour of her children, make arrangements with her mother and sisters (her daughters as she aged) or with her neighbours in the ward, or poor retainers. Women joined together for all phases of the agricultural season, including clearing fields, hoeing, planting, weeding and harvesting. In fact, the Tswana word for 'harvest', letsema also means 'working together'. Large groups of women went out together to work in the fields, but work parties might have numbered just a few.170 Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell the proportion of labour done by household members in their own fields, by equals exchanging labour, or by clients attracted or coerced into their masters' fields. Only two descriptions of work parties from early years exist, and both suggest that self-interest co-existed with reciprocal activity among women. Observers noted that women of the highest rank worked side by side with commoners.171 Work was egalitarian, but it was not a communal arrangement requiring from each according to her ability, for contributions were measured: 'They all sing while at work, and strike the ground with their axes according to time, so no one gives a stroke more than another'.' 72 Also, there were motivations besides the harvest: The manner in which the females cultivate the soil is not llnworthy of notice. They may be seen, perhaps fifty together, working in a line on the samle spot, and holding the native spade in hand ready to strike it into the ground. ... While at work they repeat a kind of song as a nmeans of animating them amidst their toils; repeating at the same time all the names of all the animals with which they are acquainted. The origin of this custom of repeating the names of animals is supposecd to be found in the following practice: when a Bechuana has succeeded in obtaining gamne, his wife invites her neighbors to partake in the pleasures of the feast, on the condition that, wheni the periods arrives for cLIltivating the ground, those who were guests, and had shared the spoil, should assist in working the soil.'73 Such a work party offered reciprocal benefits, labour for food. Workers in such parties may have been from all social strata, attracted by the promise of a meat feast, but there was 167 J. Comaroff and J. L. Comaroff, Of Revelation, 1, pp. 126-152. J.

These two descriptions provide evidence that production was not organised on the basis of sharing. It is worthwhile to recall Iliffe's observation: 'Reciprocity disguised inequality'. 74 Women's co-operation was tempered by the status of households. Those poor who had fields could not be as successful as their richer neighbours. Despite the abundance of land, and the possibility that every household was free to cultivate as much as it was able,'75 the ability to attract help restricted the production of the poor, who unlike the rich, had fewer means to draw workers. The rich had real advantages in reciprocal work: work bands began at the chief's or headman's and worked down to the poorest household's fields, which then suffered lower yields for having been prepared later in the season. The richest people could slaughter an animal to attract additional labour, an option beyond the means of poor farmers. Inequality becomes clearer in the evidence for forced labour. In good years, at least, chiefs and wealthy men coerced poorer people to help in their fields.'76 Certainly, cultivation was dependent upon more egalitarian reciprocity between equals than was herding, in which patron - client relations were the rule. However, the production methods and ownership patterns among women were not the opposite of the individual ambition motivating men. The difference between male and female relations arose from the resources they controlled. Greater reciprocity existed in cultivation because its practice benefited from it. Also, unlike herding, the pursuit of success and the control of agricultural produce could not lead to real status. Grain was a less durable, higher risk commodity than stock, requiring more labour for these lesser rewards. This society excluded the category of females from stock ownership and relegated grain ownership to them instead. However, the relationship between men and women in food production cannot be understood only in terms of exclusion and control. Jeff Guy has considered the relationship between pastoralism and male domination: 'We cannot continue merely to equate cattle and followers with power and social strength; we have to ask why this was so'.'177 Guy's own answer draws on the work of Claude Meillassoux and contrasts much of the argument presented thus far. He states that the need for labour power caused men to take control over both production and reproduction in subsistence societies: 'It was the continuous acquisition, creation, control, and appropriation of labour power which was the dynamic social principle upon which South African precapitalist societies were founded. This labour power was realised by men, through the exchange of cattle for the production and reproductive capacities of women.' His concern with labour rather than commodities is explicit, as Guy testifies to 'the central importance of the control of labour power in these societies, rather than the control of the product of labour'.'78 He does grant that stock were a more valuable product than cultivation, not because they better supported subsistence, but because the accumulated surplus could be exchanged for labour.'79 Because homestead heads, elderly men, had exclusive rights to accumulate and exchange cattle, he asserts: 'In the societies being examined here it seems to me valid to argue that the dominant class consisted of married-men/homestead heads. The subordinate class consisted of women and children, the product of their labour being appropriated by their husbands and fathers.' 80 He continues: 174 Iliffe, The Africant Poor, p. 71. 175 Barrow,A Voyage, p. 400. 176 Moffat, Missioniary Labolrs, pp. 8-9; Smith, Diay, 1, p. 296. 177 J.

I am not arguing that to understand the historical manifestations of these difference is unimportant. I am arguing however that the differences between chief and homestead-head were differences of degree and not differences in kind, that the conflicts amongst them were conflicts amongst members of the same class, and that, in central analytical terms, it is incorrect to see chiefs and homestead- heads as the poles of a social dichotomy.181 Iris Berger has criticised Guy's argument for building an argument on oppression to the exclusion of any consideration of agency, noting that he does not consider how women's activities benefited themselves, filled their needs and those of their children. Moreover, his explanation of the relationship between social power and labour power does not correspond to evidence about production and social difference in the thornveld.182 The first issue is of class difference among men. The point that men experienced no qualitative class differentiation and that their conflicts were merely intramural is entirely contradicted by the body of evidence about the difficulties hindering the balala from participating in the processes of accumulation. The next question regards the centrality of labour power and control over it in production. 'Beasts of burden' women have been called.183 The missionary Campbell described male and female responsibilities: 'It is the province of the women to build their houses, to dig the fields, to sow and reap; and that of the men to milk the cows, make the clothes and go to war'.' 84 This was not an equal division of labour: 'Men are seen asleep in different parts of the town at all times of the day, but a women asleep I have not yet seen'. 185 Women's role was similar to the batlhanka: 'Two thirds of the nation are women and even without any wars they would have to belong to the working class'.'186 However, outsider evidence about male and female labour must be read with an awareness of the observer's thinking on the proper spheres of men and women, the fields and the home.187 Now, all indications are that women worked harder then men. Still, this fact does not justify understanding them firstly as 'beasts of burden' whose daily life was controlled by men. The evidence for this case suggests that they responded to incentives, and that their reciprocal arrangements increased efficiency and broadened sources of food. Women worked harder because cultivation was harder work than stock keeping. Although it was harder work than stock keeping, recall the observation that shifting cultivators can provide for themselves with a few hours labour per day. Seasonally high demands for labour could be met by working longer hours. The lower classes were required in the fields only sporadically and parents did not seem to demand much labour from children.188 This is an indication that available household labour was not maximised, and therefore women had more autonomy, although they did have tasks, cooking, child-care, and house building, besides cultivation. Because milk provided much of the diet of townsfolk, and because people also gained food through foraging, we know that there was not a great pressure on cultivation to provide the food supply. Compared with the politics and violence dedicated to the control of cattle, the activities of men do not reveal domination of labour power as the 'dynamic social principal'. In the light of male competition over stock, the control of female ability to reproduce labour power appears less critical. Low bridewealth provides evidence here. A few indications of 181 Guy, 'Analysing Pre-Capitalist Societies', p. 29.

The lower classes could pay no stock at all.189 This suggests that rather than being a means to control and exchange a highly valued resource, bridewealth was more important for its symbolic and political meanings.190 It is also significant that it was not restricted to cultivating societies: there were also gifts of cattle to the bride's family among Khoisan herders, including the local Korana,19' and the Tlhaping and Tlharo would not have had a completely separate logic for bridewealth than their Korana ancestors and relatives did. Not only does the competition over stock but not brides refute the argument that labour power was the most valued resource, but the political and cultural significance of cattle among men made human labour power less critical. Men gave stock much attention, which increased the number of cows and therefore milk, gained with less human effort than grain. Ironically, the importance of stock motivated greater male effort in food production, and lessened the amount of shortfall women had to make up through their labour. This leaves unanswered the fundamental question of why agro-pastoral labour was divided by gender. Nothing about production methods required women to be restricted to cultivation. The reason lies instead in culture and cosmology. Jean Comaroff has described a Tswana view of the possible interactions of humans and their environment as a hierarchy with foragers in the bush at the bottom, women in fields in the middle, and cattle in the chief's kraal at the top. In fact, only cattle-owning men qualified as being fully human. Female reproductive capability was feared to have the power to threaten production, particularly cattle and the social achievements of men. Rituals sustained this worldview and reproduced the social order resting upon it.192 Comaroff's presentation of the symbolic ordering of the world of men, women, the non-human environment and production corresponds to the way social difference determined who practised which forms of food production. For Comaroff, the worldview symbolised the inequalities of society, and ritual managed the tensions. However, a deeper explanation of the cosmology behind gender in society may be possible. Eugenia Herbert has examined the importance of gender in processes of transformation throughout sub-Saharan Africa. She has explored a wider belief that female reproductive abilities might endanger such varied actions as iron-making, pottery and hunting. She maintains processes of transformation are characterised by three characteristics: designation of work roles by gender, age and social criteria, resulting in the exclusion of a significant number of people; anthropomorphism and genderisation of paraphernalia; ritual and prescriptive behaviour.193 The first and last of these are obvious in food production activities of the Sotho-Tswana agro-pastoralists, but the anthropomorphism and gendered paraphernalia are not obvious. Consideration of herding and cropping as processes of transformation could allow us to consider gender and food production among the Sotho-Tswana within the context of other practices across a broader region. If these observations about gender and power hold, they will give further weight to arguments that relations between male and female cannot be understood as the exploitation by men of 189 Somerville, Williaml Somerville's Narrative, p. 122; Burchell, Travels in the Interior, 2, p. 398. 190 On different approaches to the significance of bridewealth, see J.L.

Environment, Production and Social Difference The evidence regarding how people produced, the efficacy of their production, and how these changed in this period, reveals that people in the Tlhaping and Tlharo chiefdoms relied upon a varied complement of food production practices. The diversity reduced risk, yet risk and the benefits of successful production were not divided evenly. Lower class people and women in towns did less efficacious work, not because their daily activities were dictated by politically powerful men, but because they were excluded from stock ownership, and foraging and cultivation was what they could do. Certain men controlled stock because they had the political power and cultural right to do so, and benefits from herding reinforced their position. This relationship between power and control, social difference and pro- duction methods will not hold throughout southern Africa. Societies in different environ- mental zones, with different levels of intensification will have divergent levels of reliance on more labour-intensive production and land-extensive resources. Acknowledging that the environment makes various forms of production possible draws attention to the historic choices of the people who worked in it. What should hold true is that the organisation of a society primarily engaged in subsistence food production requires consideration in the light of food production practices. People in the thornveld developed a way of providing food for themselves which was not bountiful, but was usually adequate for the population of the towns, the households of the fortunate and powerful. Work patterns were formed because of environmental condi- tions, the subsistence requirements of the population, the machinations of the powerful, and understanding of male and female potential. Because of the greater efficacy of pastoralism, providing sufficient food supplies and storable wealth with less risk and less labour, the most powerful members of society acted to arrogate the benefits of stock keeping to themselves. Powerful men invested their efforts in stock keeping, a form of production which drew upon the wide grazing lands and was most suited to the semi-arid environment. Excluded from this, women practised rain-fed shifting cultivation. Through ill fortune and exploitation the balala were left only with the option of foraging. The destitution which overcame them was real threat for everyone. The way to avoid destitution was through negotiation with family, neighbours, patrons, clients and the environment. These were truly games against nature' but the rules were different for rich and poor, and men and women. NANCY J.
