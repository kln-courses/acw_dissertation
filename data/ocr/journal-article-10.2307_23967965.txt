Writing a Systematic Theology is not for the faint-hearted. On that score Robert Jenson, whose theological heroes are Jonathan</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 429 Edwards and Karl Barth, is well qualified for the task he has undertaken. He writes with great verve and a firm, if provocative, vision of what needs to be said. This first of two projected volumes offers Prolegomena and two substantive sections, entitled 'The Triune Identity' and 'The Triune Character'. Theology is the church reflecting on its fundamental message, namely that Jesus has risen from the dead (p. 4). And 'to attend theologically to the Resurrection of Jesus is to attend to the triune God' (p. 13). So the triune God, which proves to include issues of Christology and of the historical Jesus, is the subject-matter of the bulk of this volume. This is not just a matter of how the various topics are ordered; it is indicative of what is affirmed about them. 'The definition of divinity by impassibility' (p. 125) and 'pagan antiquity's interpretation of being as persistence' (p. 159) must be replaced by an understanding of God determined by the biblical narrative. That enterprise is carried through with a thor oughgoing enthusiasm that leads to some striking affirmations. A few examples must suffice. 'Were God identified by Israel's Exodus or Jesus' Resurrection, without being identified with them ... the revealing events would be our clues to God, but not be God' (p. 59). 'God is a person ... he makes threats and repents of them, he makes promises and tricks us by how he fulfills them. If we understand this language as fundamentally inappropriate, as "anthropomorphic", we do not know the biblical God' (p. 222). 'Any pattern of thought that in any way abstracts God "himself" from this person [the Son], from his death ... his family or his maleness or his Jewishness ... has, according to Nicea, no place in the church' (p. 103). 'We must understand the Crucifixion, precisely as Jesus' human doing and suffering, as an event in God's triune life ... the event in God that settles what sort of God he is over against fallen creation' (p. 189). 'An unexamined presupposition of God's nonobjectivity or non-embodiment runs right through much of the tradition ... But, of course God does in fact have a body, the body born of Mary and risen into the church and sacraments. When the dis ciples turned to the object Jesus, or when we turn to the object loaf and cup or bath or gathered community, we have precisely the body of God for our object' (pp. 228-9). What is remarkable about these utterances is not so much the utterances themselves—there are contexts in which some of them at least might figure as powerful religious affirmations—but the insistence on the direct manner in which they are to be understood. Any qualification of the nature of their language is seen as under mining their true force. Talk of atonement doctrines as 'pictures'</page><page sequence="3">430 REVIEWS or 'metaphors' is to deny their 'cognitive seriousness', a 'counsel of despair' which implies that 'we cannot say what God in fact did did at the Crucifixion, and so cannot say that he actually did anything' (p. 188). To construe Paul's use of the word 'body' in I Corinthians 12 'as a simile or trope' makes 'mush of Paul's argument' (p. 205). Even some of those who would go along with his general approach may wonder whether such corollaries as these necessarily follow from it. But there are, of course, difficulties about the basic approach itself. Is the biblical narrative so privileged that it can fulfil so great a role on its own? Might historical critical study undermine its coherence and show it to be inadequate for such a task? Theoretically, yes; but in practice, no. If Jesus is risen, he will ensure that it does not (p. 174), just as our confidence in the church's distinguishing of true apostles from false in the second century is based not on historical evidence but on 'trust in the Spirit's leading' (p. 26). And if Jesus is not risen, there is no gospel truth of any kind. So we are presented with a dichotomy: either a God identified exclusively by the biblical narrative or no Christian truth whatever. In the light of such an uncompromising conviction, it is perhaps not surprising that other scholarly approaches tend to be brushed aside in somewhat cavalier fashion. If, in pursuit of the grand design, detailed historical difficulties receive somewhat less attention than they might deserve, this is perhaps matched by lapses in attention to some of the academic proprieties. Ancient languages, starting with the Latin of the dedication and on through the bits of Greek cited in the notes, are prone to inaccuracy. Book titles appear in inconsistent and sometimes inaccurate forms. References are not always traceable. Yet even for those as unconvinced by the thesis of the book as I remain, there are still not a few passages where some aspect of the gospel finds deep, moving and challenging expression.
