In order to illustrate this I will begin with a brief comparison between the Hebrew text of Hos 12 and the Targum's translation of it. I will then focus on those verses that are relevant to the image of Jacob (Hos 12:3-6; 12:13-14), looking first at the Hebrew text and then at their interpretation in theTargum. An Overall Comparison of the Masoretic Text and the Targum Hosea 12 In the following synoptic overview, I have compared a translation of the Hebrew text of Hos 12 with the Targums translation of this text.2 I have classified the similarities and dissimilarities between the texts by using small capitals for the elements in the Hebrew text that do not occur in the Targum and vice versa (i.e., the omissions and additions). I have used nor mal text for those elements that do correspond (i.e., the verbatim quota tion of one or more words of the source text in the Targum) and italics for any differences between the texts other than additions or omissions. According to many exegetes, Hos 12 can be characterized as a disparate unity.' A narrative about Jacob is integrated into a story about Ephraim and prophetic speech and the word of God are interwoven in the text. Furthermore, the references to the patriarch Jacob and to the exodus (Moses) point to the text having a diverse background. The text's com pound structure from various traditions has led scholars to try to recon struct its diachronic development.4 However, with regard to our specific 21 The translation of the Targum is based on the translation by Cathcart, in K. J. Cathcart and R. R Gordon, The Targum of the Minor Prophets: Translated, with a Critical Introduction, Apparatus Apparatus and Notes (The Aramaic Bible 14; Edinburgh: Clark, 1989), 56-57. However, I sometimes deviate from this translation in the comparison. Jl Cf. E.

Pfeiffer; Β Ζ AW Β Ζ AW 400; Berlin: de Gruyter, 2009), 291-321, esp. 292-99. 41 Wolff considers Hos 12 as a composite of five loosely connected sayings (Hos 12:1-2; 12:3-7; 12:8-10; 12:11-12; 12:13-14; and 12:15 as a summary), apart from a Judean redac tion in Hos 12:3, 6.

We can take for granted that the meturgeman had a version of Hosea in front of him that was more or less the same as the Masoretic Text.' Gerd Mohn, 1966). According to Jeremias, the verses that deal with Jacob are the core (Hos 12:*3-5, 7, 13-14). He believes that the parts that mainly deal with Ephraim (Hos 12:1a, 2, 8-10,11-12, 15) go back to other words of Hosea, and were joined together in later times. He considers Hos 12:1b, 2b, 3a, 6 to be ajudean actualization. See J. Jeremias, Der Prophet Hosea (Der Prophet Hosea (Der Prophet Hosea (ATD 24.1; Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1983), 149. Others reckon with a Hoseanic layer that gradually grew. See for example, K. Marti, Das DodekaprophetonDodekapropheton (KHC 13; Tubingen: Mohr, 1904), 94-96; I. Willi-PIein, Vorformen der SchriftexegeseSchriftexegese innerhalb des Alten Testaments: Untersuchungen zum literarischen Werden der aufauf Amos, Hosea und Micha zuriickgehenden Biicher im hebraischen Zwolfprophetenbuch (BZAW(BZAW 123; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1971), 210-19. " Targum Jonathan is the official Babylonian Targum to the prophets. It is the counterpart of of Targum Onqelos on the Pentateuch, with which it has affinities in language and in the character of its translation. Targum Jonathan originates in the period before 135 G.E., but it probably underwent revision and standardization in the middle of the second century C.E. to accommodate it to the Hebrew Vorlage. See P. S. Alexander, "Jewish Aramaic Translation of Hebrew Scriptures," in Mikra: Text, Translation, Reading and Interpretation of the the Hebrew Bible in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity (ed. M.J. Mulder; CRINT 2.1; Assen: van Gorcum, 1988), 217-54 (esp. 223, 247, 249); Cathcart and Gordon opt for a date after 70 C.E., see Cathcart and Gordon, The Targum of the Minor Prophets, 16-18. For a recent study of the its origin and history, see A. Houtman and H. Sysling, Alternative Targum Targum Traditions: The Use of Variant Readings for the Study in Origin and History of Targum Jonathan Jonathan (Studies in the Aramaic Interpretation of Scripture 9; Leiden: Brill, 2009). Targum Jonathan presents a base translation with supplements. It pursues an open dialogue with the source text, which it represents in Aramaic. See W. F. Smelik, "Translation and Commentary in One: The Interplay of Pluses and Substitutions in the Targum of the Prophets," JSJ29 (1998): 245-60, esp. 248.</page><page sequence="7">J. van Ruiten / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 43 (2012) 595-612 601 The text in its final form consists of an elaborate accusation against Ephraim (Hos 12:1-2) followed by a lawsuit between the Lord and Ephraim/Jacob (Hos 12:36.(15 ־ The lawsuit has an introduction (Hos 12:3) and a conclusion (Hos 12:15), which balance each other because each con tains the expression "He will requite him" (ישיב לו), and each time this is in the third colon of a tricolon. Between the beginning and the end, one can discern three strophes: 1. Hos 12:4-7: the author looks back upon Jacob's history (4-5) before closing with God's words to Jacob in Bethel (v. 6-7); 2. Hos 12:8-11: an accusation against Ephraim (v. 8-9) is followed by God's words to Israel (v. 10-11); 3. Hos 12:12-14: Israel and Jacob's conduct (v. 12-13) is negatively contrasted with the Lord's conduct towards Israel, and the author uses the word of God from the second strophe (v. 14: exodus; prophecy). The three strophes have a similar construction: an accusation (v. 4-5, 8-9, 12-13) is followed by an utterance from or about the Lord (v. 6-7, 10-11, 14). Although Tg. Hos. 12 follows the same order as the Hebrew text, it is interesting to note that the threefold insertion of a summons, "O, prophet say to them" (Hos 12:4a, 9d, 13a), has an effect on the structure of the text. These additions not only create a caesura in the text but also seem to have a rhetorical function because the words that follow are directed at the listener.7 This can be seen in the use of the second plural form (see v. 7-8; v. 9d-10; v. 13-14).8 In two cases (v. 4a; v. 13a) the summons is followed by a rhetorical question ("Was it not said...?") that admits no contradic tion. In both cases, special attention is paid to Jacob's life. In the third case (v. 9d) the summons is followed by the interjection הא ("Look!"), which functions as a call for attention. By adding the summons, rhetorical ques tions and interjection, the meturgeman creates a structure for Hos 12 that differs from the structure proposed by the Hebrew text. In this changed structure, passages containing an accusation against Ephraim (v. 1-3, 9a-c, 12, 15) alternate with the summons telling the prophet to admonish his listeners (v. 4-8, 9d, 13-14). In these admonishments, Jacob (v. 4-5, 13-14) 61 For the synchronic structure of the text, see A. de Pury, "Osee 12 et ses implications pour le debat actuel sur le Pentateuque," in Le Pentateuque: Debats et recherches (ed. R Haudebert; LD 151; Paris: Cerf, 1992), 175-207, esp. 185-88; Blum, "Hosea 12," 299-302. 7) This summons, which occurs three times in Tg. Hos. 12, is a rather rare expression else where. It can also be found in Hos 3:3; 5:13; 10:6; Jes 5:3; 58:3; Jer 2:24; 5:7; 31:3 and Ezek 16:23. 8) Note especially the addition of לא תהון כ ("Be not like") in Hos 12:8a and the suffix second plural instead of the first singular used in the Hebrew text of Hos 12:9d-f.</page><page sequence="8">602 J. van Ruiten /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 43 (2012) 595-612 and the prophet (v. 10, 11, 14) are the role models for religious transfor mation and the return to God. Furthermore, the people's identity is linked to their history, which should serve to motivate them to consider their behaviour. The insertions also state that God who was revealed to Jacob and Moses is the same God for every generation (v. 6), and that this God, the God of the liberation from Egypt (v. 10, 14), is still active, so the people must worship him and "guard mercy and judgment" (v. 7; cf. v. 11). The effect of the insertion of the summons by the meturgeman is that the words of the prophet are spoken directly to the listener. The structure of Tg.Tg. Hos. 12 can be summarized as follows: 1-3 Accusation (Ephraim/Judah) 4-8 Summons ("O prophet say to them") 9a-c Accusation (Ephraim) 9d-l 1 Summons ("O prophet say to them") 12 Accusation 13-14 Summons ("O prophet say to them") 15 Accusation (Ephraim) Although I focus on the image of Jacob in theTargum, I would like to start by pointing to some of the more general alterations with regard to the Hebrew text. The uniqueness and transcendence of God is very important for theTargum,9 so the human and the divine are separate. The preposition קדם ("before") maintains the dignity of God10 in, for example, Tg. Hos. 12:1a ("The house of Ephraim have multiplied lies before me") and 3a ("there is an indictment before the Lord"). Important in this respect is the use of term פלחנא ("service," "worship") in Hos 12:1c ("They were fervent in in in in the worship'), Id ("and they who worshipped before me in the sanctuary") and 7a ("be strong in the worship of your God"), which is close to the expression "fear of the Lord."11 Furthermore, one can point to the addition of "deliverance" to Hos 12:7c ("Wait for the deliverance of your God, con tinually"). A ubiquitous addition in Targum Jonathan is בית ("the house of"), which one finds several times in this chapter: 1 refer to Hos 12:1a, lb, י"י"י" Cf. L. Smolar, and Μ. Aberbach, Studies in the Targum Jonathan to the Prophets (New York: KTAV, 1983), 1301-50; Cathcart and Gordon, Targum of the Minor Prophets, 4.4. See M. L. Klein, "The Preposition ('Before'): A Pseudo-Anti-Anthropomorphism in the Targums,"Targums," JTS30Targums/'/TS30 (1979): 502-7. 111 See Cathcart and Gordon, Targum of the Minor Prophets, A.</page><page sequence="9">J. van Ruiten / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 43 (2012) 595-612 603 lc, 2a, 3a, 9a, 15a.12 In one case we see the metaphor converted into a simile (Hos 12:2a: "The house of Israel is like one etc.").13 Finally, I would point to the—text-critically somewhat difficult—text in Hos 12:1 cd ויהודה עד רד עם אל ועם קדושים נאמן ("But Judah is still roaming with El, and with the holy ones he is faithful").14 The first part (ויהודה עד רד עם אל) is translated as ודבית יהודה הוו מיתקפין בפלחנא עד דגלא עמא דאלהא מארעהון ("But the house of Judah, they were fervent in worship until the people of God were exiled from their land"). The Hebrew עד ('od\ "still") is read with a different vocalization ad ("until"); the difficult רד (often translated with "roaming with" from the root חד) is understood by the meturgeman to come from the root ירד ("to go down"), which is taken in the sense of "to go down in exile [from their land]"; and עם (im\ "with") is vocalized as am ("people"). The second part (ועם קדושים נאמן) is rendered with ואנון דהוו פלחין קדמי בבית מקדשא מתקר! עמא קדישא בנק הוו קיימק ("And they who worshipped before me in the sanctuary were called a holy people. Thus they were established"). The Hebrew עם קדושים ('im qedosim, "with the holy ones") is read as am qedosim ("a holy people"), whereas נאמן ("faith fill") might be read as נאמר ("it is called"), thereby confusing the final nun and the resh, as was the case in the Septuagint.15 However, it is also possible that הוו קיימק ("they were established") reflects 16.נאמן 121 Only in Hos 12:1b is it also in the Hebrew text. 'נ) This happens quite often in Targum Jonathan. See Cathcart and Gordon, Targum of the Minor Minor Prophets, 2. The same simile can be found in Tg. Hos. 8:7. There the Targum stays closer to the Hebrew text ("They sow the wind and they reap the whirlwind"). 141 LXX Hos 11:12cd (=12:led) reads: "Now God has come to know them, and they shall be called the holy people of God" (νΰν έγνω αυτούς ό θεός, και λαός άγιος κεκλήσεται θεοϋ.). Despite the difference with the MT, the Hebrew can still be detected in the Greek translation. MT עוד ("still") is translated as νΰν ("now"), which might go back to עתה. MT ח־ עם ("he is roaming with") is rendered by έγνω αύτούς ("[God] has come to know him"), which goes back to ידעם (= "he has known them"), which points to a confusion of י and ר. MT עם ('im; "with") is rendered with λαός, ("people") which is a translation of עם ('am׳, "people"). MT נאמן ("faithful") is rendered with LXX κεκλήσεται ("they shall be called"), which might go back to נאמר ("it is said"). See a discussion of the problems in D. Barthelemy, Critique Critique textuelle de I'Ancien Testament: Tome 3■ Ezekiel, Daniel et Us 12 Prophetes (OBO 50.3; Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1992), 596-600; E. Bons, J. Joosten, and S.

The discussion in the Biblia HebraicaHebraica Quinta, however, correctly states that an understanding of the word similar to the Septuagint seems to underlie the first of the renderings of the Targum ("were called"),</page><page sequence="10">604 J. van Ruiten / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 43 (2012) 595-612 A Negative Image of Jacob in the Hebrew Text of Hosea 12 Hosea's explicit allusions to Jacob are mostly reduced to parallel words and phrases in the Jacob cycle (Gen 25-36). One can refer to the aetiology of the name יעקב, which is related to the following: the verb עקב (Gen 25:23 26; 27:36; Hos 12:4); the verbal chain ויובל וישר (cf. Gen 32:29; Hos 12:4-5); the idiomatic phrase עבד ב (cf. Gen 29:18; 31:41; Hos 12:12); and the expressions ברח ,ארם ,שמר (Gen 27:43; 28:5; 30:31; Hos 12:13-14).17 However, it is important for the interpretation of this chapter to stress that the narrative about the patriarch Jacob is intertwined with Hosea's descrip tion of the contemporary people of Israel. One should therefore be aware that when something is said about Jacob, it can be applied to Israel and vice versa.18 The identification of the patriarch with the people is facilitated by the use of the name Jacob for the people in Hos 12:3b (in parallel with Judah) and by the use of the name Israel for the patriarch in Hos 12:13b (in parallel with Jacob). Negative elements in Jacob's history become clear in light of the deceptive and sinful behaviour of Ephraim (Hos 12:1-2, 8-9, 15). Most modern commentators argue that in Hos 12 there is an analogy between Jacob's negative characteristics and the failures of his descendants, the Israel of later times.'9 The history of the patriarch quali fies the deceitful attitude of his descendants. He deceived his brother in the womb already, and "in his power" he fought arrogantly with God, his vie tory expressed as begging and crying. With the words "in the womb he seized his brother (at the heel)" (בבטן עקב את אחיו: Hos 12:4a) refers to Jacob's birth tradition. The verb עקב is used in Gen 25:26 ("Afterward his brother came forth, and his hand had taken hold of Esau's heel; so his name was called Jacob") but whereas Gen 25:26 refers to the actual delivery, Hosea speaks about the period before whereas its second attests the Masoretic Text.

With these words, however, he might refer to Gen 25:23 ("And Yhwh said to her: 'Two nations are in your womb [בבטנך], and two peoples from your belly [ממעיך], shall be divided Because of the parallelism between בבטנך and ממעיך, this might imply that it also means "after the delivery." Gen 25:22 says, "The children strug gled together within her (בקרבה)." The interpretation of עקב is not explic itly pejorative in Gen 25:26. Later in the story of Genesis, Jacob's underhandedness becomes apparent when Esau sells his birthright (Gen 25:27-34) and Jacob takes away his blessing (Gen 27): "Esau said: 'Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me (ויעקבני) these two times. He took away my birthright; and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.' Then he said: 'Have you not reserved a blessing for me?'" (Gen 27:36).20 Hosea presents Jacobs underhandedness as latent in the womb. Hosea 12:4b-5b ("And in his power he strove with God. He strove with an angel and prevailed, he wept and implored his favor") is mostly inter preted as an allusion to the story of Jacob's struggle at the Jabbok (Gen 32:23-33), especially to Gen 32:29 ("For you strove with God and with men, and you prevailed": 2·(כי שרית עם אלהים ועם אנשים ותוכל' The same verbs שרה and יכל are used in Hos 12:4b-5a and Gen 32:29. This is explicit in Gen 32:29 with Jacob's name change ("Your name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel"), whereas it is implicit in Hos 12:4a-5a (play of the verbs עקב and שרה). The expression "in his power" (באונו) does not occur in the narrative in Genesis about Jacob's combat at the Jabbok. Exegetes point to several possible interpretations of the ambivalent term 22.און It could refer to Jacob's virile power (cf. Gen 49:3; comp. Deut 21:17; Ps 78:51), because after the description of Jacob's deeds "in the womb" (Hos 12:4a), the text goes on to describe his deeds as a grown man. However, it could also refer to Jacob's wickedness if it is interpreted as the 2י" Cf. the word מרמה in Gen 27:35 ("But he said, 'Your brother came with deceit [מרמה], and he has taken away your blessing'"), which is used in Hos 12:1 as the characterization of Ephraim. 211 See, for example, Wolff, Dodekapropheton, 1,206,212; J.

In Ps 36:4, this word is used in parallel with מרמה ("deceit"), a word used to describe the deceit of the house of Israel (Hos 12:1b). It might also refer to Jacob's wealth, alluding to the wealth of contemporary Israel (Hos 12:9). Jacob's arrogance is reflected in his combat with God. This attitude results from his physical strength, youth, material wealth or moral decline. His crying (Hos 12:5b: "he wept and implored his favor") has no clear parallel in Genesis, but might refer to Jacob as a blubbering contender, begging for a blessing (Gen 32:27) rather than a hero who enters into combat with heavenly powers and wins.24 Hosea 12:5cd is about Jacob finding God in Bethel, referring to the two encounters with God in Genesis: Gen 28:11-22 and Gen 35:6-15. Although the wording is different, God is said to reveal himself to Jacob in Gen 35:7. With regard to God speaking to Jacob, see Gen 35:13-15, where the verb דבר (Piel) is used three times. Although Hos 12:6 is regarded by many exegetes as a later addition,25 the final form of the text can be con sidered a continuation of Hos 12:5cd, in that it makes explicit whom Jacob found in Bethel.26 Hosea 12:7 is God's speech to Jacob in Bethel.27 Consistent with their explanation of Hos 12:4-5, most exegetes con sider Hos 12:13 to be a negative allusion to Jacob. One can point to the parallelism between the altar ruins on the furrows of the field (Hos 12:12) and Jacob's flight to the field of Aram (Hos 12:13). In fact, Gilead evokes a reminiscence of the narrative of Jacob in Genesis. The end of the Jacob Laban story (Gen 31:36-54) speaks of Gilead (Gen 31:25; and Gal'ed [Gen 31:47] as its interpretation), and other words from Hos 12:12 are also used in this story (28.(גל, זבח, מזבה Jacob/Israel is confronted with the positive example, Moses (Hos 12:14), who is considered to be perfect.

In Gen 33:4, Esau cries on Jacobs shoulder. See W. L. Holladay, "Chiasmus, the Key to Hosea XIIXII 3-6," VT16 (1966): 53-64. 2,1 See, for example, Wolff, Dodekapropheton 1, 276. *,יי Cf.

Moses is considered a source of prophetical identification for Hosea (cf. Hos 12:10-11, 15), whereas Jacob represents a nation that rejects the prophetic message. The contrast between Hos 12:13 and Hos 12:14 is clear both linguistically and thematically. There is a contrast between the twice repeated באשה ("for a wife") and בנביא ("through a prophet"). Moreover, both verses use the verb שמר (qal in Hos 12:13c; nip'al in Hos 12:14b). Finally, there is a contrast between Jacobs flight to Aram (for protection and bondage) and from Egypt (from bondage). The reference to Jacob's "service for a wife" (Hos 12:13) seems to be an allusion to the stories of Jacob in the house of Laban (Gen 29-31). According to some, Hosea is referring here to Jacob's submis sion in order to marry Rachel and Leah, which was the result of sexual desire.29 According to De Pury, Hos 12:13-14 relate to two distinct tradi tions: the patriarchal tradition (Hos 12:13), which is depreciated, and the Mosaic tradition, which is valued.30 In Hos 12:14, the prophet Moses is central to the origin of Israel, and it is through him that Israel is protected. In Hos 12:13, it is the wife (Rachel) who is central to the origin of Israel, and it is through her that Israel is protected. In Hos 12:13-14 there are two different conceptions of Israel's identity: a genealogical and a prophetic one. What is constituent of Israel? Does it have a genealogy or does it obey the word of Yhwh mediated through the prophets? The true identity of Israel, the text concludes, is based not on birth but on vocation.31 The Positive Image of Jacob in Tg Hosea 12 In the Hebrew text of Hos 12 there is a continuity between a disenchanted Jacob and the sinful people, so they cannot be viewed separately. In the Targum, however, there is a sharp contrast between them. According to the Targum, Hosea's aim is to admonish his listeners, and Jacob is the model for religious transformation and the return to God.

In Tg. Hos. 12:3, the meturgeman adds the adjective תקניא ("according to his good deeds he will requite him"), which changes the structure of the sentence. Whereas Hos 12:3a remains an announcement of a lawsuit against Judah,32 Hos 12:3bc seems to be understood by the meturgeman as a kind of testimony. At the very beginning, the prophet gives his opinion about the result of the lawsuit. Moreover, it seems as if the Targum does not consider "Jacob" here as the people (in parallel with Judah in v. 3a), but as the patriarch, whose name reoccurs, in addition, in Tg. Hos. 12:4a. According to Tg. Hos. 12:3, Jacob acts in a way that is acceptable to God and will not be punished in the lawsuit.33 Right from the beginning, Jacob is not put on a par with the contemporary wicked and deceitful people. This antithetical position is confirmed at the end of the chapter (Hos 12:15), where it is stated that Ephraim is requited according to his wicked deeds. One can also refer to Tg. Hos. 4:9, which is placed in the context of God's lawsuit against Israel, the priests and the royal house, and in which the same language is used as in Hos 12:3. The people are characterized by wickedness and lack of knowledge of God. In his rephrasing of God's ver diet, the meturgeman adds two pejorative adjectives: "their wicked ways" and "their perverted deeds" ("Now just as they made the layman like the priest to desecrate my holy sacrifices, so I will profane their glory and make what is precious contemptible, so that I may visit them according to their wicked wicked ways and requite them according to their perverted deeds"). In this way, the wickedness of the people is made explicit in the judgment. The deeds of the people are defined as wickedness and perversion, and this is exemplified by the forgotten knowledge of God's law (Hos 4:7) and the desecration of the offerings (Hos 4:8, 9). Just as Tg. Hos. 4:9 makes its negative verdict of the contemporary people explicit, Tg. Hos. 12:4 makes its positive verdict of Jacob explicit.34 With the mention of Jacob's "good" deeds, the meturgeman creates a sharp separation of the patriarch Jacob and the house of Israel. ·2י) According to many commentators the Hebrew text originally reads "Israel" here. 3" The meturgeman probably read Hos 12:3c as an asyndetic adversative sentence ("But he will requite him according to his good deeds"). 341 See also Tg. Hos. 4:19 ("The deeds of their lords are not good... Now 1 shall bring upon them the enemy..."); Cf. Tg. Hos. 11:3; 14:10.</page><page sequence="15">/. van Ruiten / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 43 (2012) 595-612 609 Tg.Tg. Hos. 12:4a starts with the addition of a summons ("O, prophet, say to them"). This not only creates a caesura between v. 3 and v. 4, but it seems to have also a rhetorical function, drawing the listeners attention to Jacob's life.35 The subsequent rhetorical question ("Was it not said...?") admits no contradiction. The Hebrew text of Hos 12:4a ("In the womb he seized his brother at the heel") is part of this rhetorical question in the Targum. The Hebrew בבטן ("in the womb") is clearly interpreted as an allusion to the time before his birth ("even before he was born"). Moreover, Jacob seizing his brother's heel (עקב את אחיו), which might evoke Jacob's underhandedness, is reworked into "he would be greater (יסגי) than his brother." The Targum refers clearly to Gen 25:23, where yhwh tells Rebekah that two nations are in her womb, and the one will be stronger than the other. It may also allude to God's command to Jacob/Israel in Gen 35:11 to be fruitful and multiply.36 In this way, the quarrel between the brothers in the womb is linked to God's blessing of Jacob in Bethel. The Targum avoids the reference to Gen 25:26, which would evoke Jacobs guile. By referring to Jacob, the Targum still hints at the verb עקב, but he uses it in a positive sense.37 By placing the origins of the people of Israel in a beneficial light this implies criticism of the contemporary people. Tg.Tg. Hos. 12:4b is very close to the Hebrew text. The main difference is that in the Targum Jacobs struggle is with the angel instead of with God ("And in his power he gained superiority over the angel").38 Moreover, the Targum interprets the verb שרה ("to struggle") as אתו־בב עם, which means, "he gained superiority over."39 Like the Hebrew text, the second half of the Targum refers to the events at the Jabbok, see especially Gen 32:29. The Targumim on Gen 32:29 all replace "God" with "angel(s)."40 Moreover, they seem to understand the verb שרה to come from שרר ("to rule").41 351 See note 7. 361 Tg. Onq. Gen. 35:11 uses the verb סגי where the Hebrew text reads רבה. 37, Cf. C. T. R. Hayward, Interpretations of the Name Israel in Ancient Judaism and Some Early Early Christian Writings: From Victorious Athlete to Heavenly Champion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 305. 38) The Vulgate and Aquila also have "angel" here instead of "God". 3,1 With the replacement of "God" (אלהים) with "the angel" and the use of the verb רברב instead of שרה, the Targum abandons the potential allusion to the name "Israel" in Hos 12:4b-5a. 4u) Josephus mentions a "divine angel." 411 Cf. A. Salvesen, Symmachus in the Pentateuch (JSSM 15; Manchester: University of Manchester, 1991), 49-50; Hayward, Interpretations of the Name Israel, 305.</page><page sequence="16">610 J. van Ruiten / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 43 (2012) 595-612 With his rendering of Hos 12:4b ("He gained superiority with the angel"), the meturgeman seems to refer to a well-known interpretation of the strug gle at the Jabhok, in which Jacob was to become Israel because he was a prince before the Lord or because he had achieved superiority over the angels.42 The aspect of Jacobs superiority is probably presupposed in Tg. Hos.Hos. 12:4b. By using בתוקפיה instead of the Hebrew באונו, the Targum seems to omit the potential negative interpretation of און. In the Targum of Hos 12, the word תקף has a more positive connotation, in that it is related to the service of God.43 The translation of Tg. Hos. 12:5ab is quite close to the Hebrew text, which now also has "angel" instead of "God." Comparable to Tg. Hos. 12:4c, וישר אל is rendered as ואתרבב עם. The second half of the verse (Tg. Hos.Hos. 12:5cd) has a variation with regard to the Hebrew text and instead of ימצאנו ("he found him") it reads אתגלי עלוהי ("he was revealed to him"). Like the Hebrew text, the Targum refers to Jacobs two encounters in Bethel (Gen 28:11; 35:6-15). The connection with Gen 35:6-15 is especially strong. In Gen 35:7 the Hebrew reads בי שם עלו אליו האלהים ("because there God had revealed himself to him"); in Gen 35:9 וירא אלהים אל יעקב עוד ("God appeared to Jacob again"). In both cases Targum Onqelos uses the verb 44.גלי Tg.Tg. Hos. 12:6 is closely related to the preceding verse. With the addition of הוא ("He"), the verse explains who the one was who spoke "with us" (Hos 12:5d). Moreover, the use of the words אתגלי ("was revealed"; Tg. Hos.Hos. 12:5c, 6a) and "Jacob" (Tg. Hos. 12:4a, 6a) strongly link the verse to the preceding context. It is not impossible that the addition "for every generation" {Tg. Hos. 12:6b) refers back to "with us." The same God who was revealed through the patriarchs and Moses is still speaking to the con temporary people. The additions in Tg. Hos. 12:6 strongly recall Exod 3:15 ("Yhwh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and thus I am to be remembered for every generation"). It is important to 421 Cf. Tg. Onq. Gen. 32:29: "You are a prince before the Lord" (רב את קדם י1י); Tg. Ps.-J. Gen.Gen. 32:29: "You gain superiority with regard to the angels of the Lord" (איתרברבת עם מלאכייא דיי). 4,1 See Tg. Hos. 12:1: "They were fervent (מיתקפין) in worship"; Tg. Hos. 12:7: "Be strong (תותקף)(תותקף) in the worship of your God." Cf. Hayward, Interpretations of the Name Israel 283. 441 Note the mention of "his brother" in Gen 35:7. See also Tg. Onq.

As we have seen, most modern exegetes consider Hos 12:13 as a nega tive allusion to Jacob. His behaviour can be placed in parallel with Gilead (v. 12), which is related to the Jacob-Laban stories in Gen 29-31, or in contrast with Moses (v. 14). The contrast between Jacob's flight to Aram (for protection and bondage) and Moses leading the people out of Egypt (from bondage) is paid particular attention. According to some, Hos 12:13 14 refer to two distinct traditions, the patriarchal genealogical tradition (v. 13), which is depreciated, and the Mosaic prophetic tradition (v. 14), which is valued. Comparable with Tg. Hos. 12:4a, Tg. Hos. 12:13a starts with the addi tion of a summons ("O, prophet, say to them"), which creates a caesura between v. 12 and v. 13. Moreover, the Hebrew is reformulated into a rhetorical question ("Did not Jacob..."). This harmonizes v. 13 and v. 14 whilst at the same time contrasting the historical experiences of Jacob and Israel with contemporary times (v. 12, v. 15). The aim of the summons in v. 13-14 is to bring to mind the stories of Jacob and the exodus as examples of the circumstances in which the contemporary people find themselves. The direct address "your father" in v. 13 and "your fathers" in v. 14 creates a connection between Jacob/Moses and the addressees. Calling Jacob their father connects the people with his history, and the rhetorical question motivates them to consider their own behaviour. In v. 13a of the Targum, the verb ברח ("flee") is replaced with the more neutral אזל ("go away"). As far as Targum Jonathan is concerned, the verb ברח (parallel with הלך) is replaced by אזל in Tg. Amos 7:12. In Targum Onqelos the ברח is translated with אזל in five places {Tg. Onq. Gen 27:43; 31:20, 21, 27), although אזל is the usual Aramaic translation of Hebrew הלך. In Tg. Onq. Gen 35:1, 7 ברח is translated with ערק ("flee"). In these places it is explicitly stated that Jacob fled from Esau.45 This might imply that the meturgeman would avoid alluding to Jacob's flight from Esau. Instead, he alludes to Gen 28:1-9, which mentions three times that Jacob went to Paddan-Aram (Gen 28:2, 5, 7). The collocation of the words ,יעקב הלך and □אר occurs only in Gen 28, where Isaac blesses Jacob when he sends him to Paddan-Aram in order to avoid exogamy. The blessing is 451 The same can be said ofTargum Pseudo-Jonathan: in Gen 31:20, 21, 27 ברח is trans lated with אזל, and in Gen 27:43; 31:22; 35:1, 7 with ערק.</page><page sequence="18">612 J. van Ruiten / Journal for the Study of Judaism 43 (2012) 595-612 crucial for Jacob's departure, because it shows his faithfulness to God. If the meturgeman is referring to this episode, it could be that he considers Jacob an example of loyalty to God. In this way, he creates a strong conti nuity between Jacob and Moses. Both obey God's commands: Jacob goes to Aram in order to love a wife, and Moses is sent by Yhwh to love the people. The reference to "your fathers" serves as a link between the genera tion of the exodus and Jacob ("your father"), thus considering them all to be part of the history of contemporary Israel. The result is that Jacob pre cedes Moses, and both are used as an example, and both are used to con trast with the behaviour of the people. The meturgeman avoids a reference to Jacob's flight and any potential negative connotations because his aim is to draw a picture of an exemplary Jacob who fulfils God's wishes. Conclusions In this paper, I have investigated the image of Jacob in Targum Jonathan's interpretation of Hos 12. I have shown that the meturgeman portrays a very positive image of Jacob, which is in contrast to the potentially nega tive image of Jacob in his source text. In the context of God's judgment of the prophet's contemporary Israel, the Hebrew text presents Jacob as the deceiver of his brother, as the one who struggled with God and as the one who served a woman. The meturgeman shows by means of allusions to those traditions in Genesis that are situated in the context of God's prom ises to Jacob that, according to him, Jacob is the blessed and exemplary father of Israel. All possible negative connotations in the Hebrew text are replaced with new positive allusions to Jacob. The continuity in the source text between a disenchanted Jacob and the sinful people, who cannot be examined separately, is substituted in the Targum with a sharp contrast between them. Whereas the Hebrew text considers the time of Moses and the exodus to be the paradigm of Israel's relationship with God and the prophet, the Targum puts Jacob on a par with Moses and places the Jacob and exodus traditions together. In fact, the Targum considers the whole history of Israel as exemplary of how the behaviour of the prophet's con temporaries has lost its legitimacy. Finally, the meturgeman applies the text to his own situation by equating his addressees with Israel and Ephraim. He summons his contemporaries to turn from their wicked ways. The day of punishment, he says, is not yet definitive, but the outcome will be nega tive, lest the addressees mend their ways.</page></plain_text>
