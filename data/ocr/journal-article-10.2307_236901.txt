Humans and Other Ani- mals. xvi + 439 pp., illus., figs., tables, app., index. Originally published in 1995 as "In the Company of Animals," a special issue of Social Research. Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1999. $45 (cloth); $20 (paper). In her crisply written and cogently observed Im- ages of Animals, Eileen Crist analyzes the writ- ings of naturalists, ethologists, and contempo- rary sociobiologists who have created a set of observations about animals-their lives, their environments, their instincts. These observa- tions, Crist argues, whether expressed in the pro- found anthropomorphism of Charles Darwin, in the technical idiom of classical ethologists such as Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz, or in the economic constructs of the sociobiologist E. O. Wilson, reflect linguistic choices respon- sible for profoundly divergent representations of animal life. Crist calls these representations "portrayals," portraits that offer alternative an- gles for viewing animal life. At stake, not sur- prisingly, are critical issues of epistemology and objectivity in the behavioral sciences. Descrip- tions of animals matter, Crist asserts, for they are constitutive of knowledge about animals. Per- haps the clearest illustration she offers of the ways in which words construct the world of ani- mals appears in a chapter devoted to comparing images of courtship in animals. Here the author considers the disparate descriptions of the mat- ing behavior of a variety of animals, including the male stickleback, the great crested grebe, the black-headed gull, the Grayling butterfly, and the scorpion. Arguing that the alternative lan- guages used by naturalists and ethologists have been closely associated with the issue of animal mind, Crist compares the Darwinian descriptions of the courtship of the freshwater fish with the ethological rendering of the identical behavior. Whereas Darwin's stickleback swims with ardor and intensity, Tinbergen's fish mates in a suc- cession of discrete behaviors reflecting a series of stimuli, a chain of reactions occurring serially in time. The fragmentation of animal experience into discrete stimulus-response interactions, Crist claims, supported the obliteration of agency in animals, fostering the rejection of ani- mal mind and animal mentality. She aims to re- habilitate the anthropomorphic stance in animal studies, where anthropomorphism-always a pejorative label-is disparaged as scientifically flawed and naively subjective. In part, she is at pains to advance the more radical notion that no neutral scientific language exists that can be de- ployed to create incontestably objective pictures of the world as it really is. Moreover, the search for a neutral language and the hierarchies it has fostered, Crist concludes, have contributed to the destruction and thoughtless exploitation of the "marvelous world of animals" (p. 222). This is an important, if sometimes philosophically dense, exposition of matters of great importance in understanding the relationships of human knowledge and animal actors and the intersec- tion of human language and animal behavior. Humans and Other Animals is a collection of conference papers previously published in the journal Social Research. Eighteen contributors from a variety of fields explore the interactions of animals and humans over time and in different cultural settings. The collection is divided into five sections: categories, histories, representa- tions, sameness and difference, and everyday life. Each of the essays is notable for its engaging and eclectic approach to the issue of animal and human relationships. For the historian of sci- ence, the volume offers several papers on the issues raised in classifications of the animal and human world, including an essay by Juliet Clut- ton-Brock on the persistence of Aristotle's scale of nature in modern attitudes toward animals and Harriet Ritvo's piece on the shifting historical boundary between the human and the nonhuman animal. There are also historical papers by Ste- phen Glickman on the "hyena reputation" in An- glo-American culture over several centuries and by Jerrold Tannenbaum on the status of animals in the American legal system. Included as well is the keynote address delivered by Stephen Jay Gould, an essay that begins with the poet Robert Burns's celebration of an invertebrate, "To a Louse," and ends with the poet Robert Frost's lines on a "dimpled spider fat and white." In be- tween, Gould, in characteristic fashion, describes some of the fallout of the Linnaean adoption of the word "primate" (he notes a hilarious letter from the secretary of the Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada to the Director of the Wis- consin Regional Primate Center), Darwin's Ex- pressions of Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), and the Burgess Shale fossil site. Like Eileen Crist, the authors of some of the essays in this conference volume are deeply invested in issues relating to animal mind and the problem- atic issue of consciousness. The philosophers Daniel Dennett and Colin McGinn offer differ- ing analyses of the nature of animal sensual ex- 834</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 91: 4 (2000) perience, and the psychologist Duane Rumbaugh examines primate language and cognition. The volume, like many conference volumes, offers a sampling of approaches and attitudes. Many of the essays provide useful starting points for more extended exploration of the animal-human nexus. SUSAN E. LEDERER Rik Scarce. Fishy Business: Salmon, Biology, and the Social Construction of Nature. (Ani- mals, Culture, and Society.) xii + 236 pp., ta- bles, app., index. Philadelphia: Temple Univer- sity Press, 2000. $59.90 (cloth); $19.95 (paper). Whether one judges this book a success or a fail- ure depends, in large measure, on the expecta- tions one brings to its reading. The title's invo- cation of social constructivism inclined me to expect a work in the tradition of the "strong pro- gram" of the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK). As such, it is a disappointment. The book begins with a statement of funda- mental assumptions: that the physical phenom- ena behind social discourse about nature have a reality independent of the social realm and that the social meanings of nature are analytically separable from the reality of nature. Rik Scarce labels this version of social constructivism as "realism" and contrasts its proponents to the rad- ical relativists, whom he tags as "idealists." This use of "lite" constructivism has some dis- turbing effects. Scarce deploys the critical and rhetorical tools of the strong program when they suit his political objectives but explicitly rejects the most interesting and challenging features of SSK-radical relativism, symmetry, and reflex- ivity. As an example of the effect this has on the story, salmon scientists are portrayed as being influenced and constrained by macro-scale social structures and processes but are not themselves seen as exerting any significant symmetrical constructive forces on their larger environment. This has the unintended effect of diminishing both their competence as professional actors in the story and their simple stature as human be- ings. But what I see as faults or deficiencies may well be read by others with differing theoretical commitments as refreshingly pragmatic and in- sightful scholarship. From any perspective, there is a lot to enjoy and admire in this text. It offers an excellent case study in the ways in which the macrostructural forces of society-politics and economics-im- pinge upon and powerfully shape the process and product of science and how complexly interac- tive social forces shape the meaning of natural actors-in this case salmon. Scarce does a good job of documenting and describing the historical origins and development of the conceptual and institutional connections between economic in- terests, political interests, and fisheries manage- ment. Methodologically, too, this work makes a valuable contribution, as it takes on the project of bridging the traditional analytical chasm di- viding macro-social and micro-social storytell- ing and does so with considerable success. Scarce's key insight is that salmon biologists have lost sight of the fact that they, or their in- tellectual predecessors, originally borrowed the engineers' "systems" concept as a useful heuris- tic but now think, talk, and act as if salmon "re- ally" are a component in an engineered system. They are genuinely surprised and frustrated when the salmon fail to "behave" as predicted. The author tells us that, if the systems created by engineers are the benchmarks for "success" in salmon management, the scientists' efforts are doomed to failure. The reason is that engineers preside over systems of their own creation in which each element, and its interactions with all other elements, has been specified with arbitrary precision. Thus the engineered systems' perfor- mance can be predicted with great confidence. None of this is true, however, in a natural "eco- system," and so the salmon biologists' efforts to exercise control over the salmon's "perfor- mance" in the system will inevitably fall short of the goal. In his conclusion Scarce reveals fully the phil- osophical and political agenda that he has kept in the background for most of the book. He claims that it is possible for humans to have di- rect, unmediated, unconstructed, and, therefore, "meaningless" experience of the natural world. In other words, individual humans can turn off a lifetime of acculturation and socialization about nature and its multiplicity of meanings and somehow have an unconstructed "raw experi- ence" of nature. Further, Scarce claims that such experiences are the only way in which we can truly understand natural reality. CHRIS FINLAYSON Paul Rabinow.
