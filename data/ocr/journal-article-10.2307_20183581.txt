In a characteristically perceptive cartoon, Gary Larson depicts a di nosaur with baseball hat, bat, and glove, looking dejectedly at a row of caves, to each of which has been affixed a notice reading "Sorry, ex tinct." As with many Larson car toons, the anthropomorphic humor is tinged with poignancy: to whom do the last surviving members of any group of animals turn for recreation or, more importantly, procreation? In contrast to negative density de pendence, the processes and impli cations of positive density depen dence have, until recently, received relatively limited scrutiny. Over the past 15 years, however, that situa tion has changed dramatically. Such has been the explosion of interest in positive density-dependent pro cesses, that it is increasingly difficult to keep track of developments. This new book aims to remedy that sit uation by bringing together in one place, the historical development of this field, together with the causes, consequences, breadth of influence, and new directions in the study of positive density dependence. Negative density dependence has long been regarded by ecologists as a fundamental feature of population dynamics. This focus arose from the initial preoccupations of ecology in cluding, critically, the search to un derstand the regulation of popula tions and the factors preventing their indefinite increase. In the later half of the last century, the attention of ecologists (and especially conserva tion biologists) turned increasingly toward the processes of population decline and the problems of small populations (Caughley 1994). In that context, focus shifted away from the factors that prevent large popula tions from getting larger, to factors that might push small populations to become smaller (the "extinction vortex" of Gilpin and Soul? [1986]). As Courchamp et al. document, this shift in focus led to a new appreci ation of the long-neglected work of Warder Allee. In contrast to the pre vailing focus, Allee had spent much of the first half of the 20th century investigating the possible benefits of animal aggregations and the disad vantages of being few (e.g., Allee 1931, 1938). This led Odum (1953) to refer to the benefits of aggrega tions or higher densities as the "Allee principle." They are now more com monly referred to as Allee effects. Much of the recent surge in in terest in Allee effects can be traced to the thorough and comprehensive work of Brian Dennis. Dennis (1989) summarized the history of and ev idence for Allee effects, illustrated why they are expected and how they can be modeled, analyzed their consequences for conservation (es pecially in relation to harvesting), and discussed their pervasive effects in "virtually all areas of population biology," from community dynamics to evolution and population genet ics. Nearly 20 years since the ap pearance of Dennis' publication, it is timely to consider how the field has grown, what we have learned, and what remains to be studied. These are the challenges of the new book by Courchamp, Berec, and Gascoigne, authors (over the last decade) of a score of papers on the Allee effect. Pleasingly laid out and entertain ingly written, Courchamp et al.'s new book is a highly comprehen sive review of the subject. De spite tackling some thorny issues to do with terminology and defi nitions, the introductory chapter is engaging and clear. It is followed by chapters reviewing the wealth of mechanisms that could lead to Allee effects and the manifold ways in which modeling has been used to explore these potential causes and their consequences. The diffi culty of demonstrating Allee effects (especially demographic Allee ef fects, manifested as positive density dependent mean population growth) empirically means that much of what we know about their likely conse quences is derived from population models. Unsurprisingly therefore, the chapter on modeling is perhaps the most comprehensive, accounting for almost one-third of the book's length. On balance, this chapter does a good job of synthesizing a huge amount of material. Nevertheless, given its length, complexity, and nec essary importance, it is perhaps a shame that the authors chose to re strict it to a single chapter. Sev eral distinctions could have been fur ther emphasized to merit separate chapters; for example, the distinc tion between purely exploratory the oretical models and models based on real systems or between models that assume Allee effects at the outset and those from which Allee effects arise as emergent consequences of simpler assumptions. The loss of genetic diversity in smaller populations is well estab lished but, perhaps more impor tantly, in chapter 4 the authors also consider the evolutionary con sequences of Allee effects. Here, the profound implications of Allee effects are brought home: many 1662 Conservation Biology, Volume 22, No. 6,1662-1671 ?2008 Society for Conservation Biology DOI: 10.1111/j. 1523-1739.2008.01104.x</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 1663 aspects of behavior, morphology, and endocrinology have evolved to deal with low-density situations and to facilitate aggregation, coopera tion, and mate finding. In this re spect it is hard to overemphasize the significance of Allee effects in driving evolution. Despite this impor tance, the backdrop to renewed in terest in Allee effects is conservation and management, and in chapter 5 Courchamp et al. consider the im plications of Allee effects for these fields. Conceding the difficulties of demonstrating Allee effects unequiv ocally, they nevertheless advocate a precautionary approach: the burden of proof should be on those claim ing that Allee effects play no role in a given system. This is an intrigu ing point that may well prove con tentious in the context of model par simony. It also remains to be seen how modelers will parameterize a process that is often so hard to detect?a point in favor of mecha nistic models from which Allee ef fects may or may not emerge. They conclude with a concise exposition of the characteristics that might indi cate the vulnerability of a population to Allee effects, together with a set of specific management areas for which this knowledge might have implica tions. Although the book's final chapter is entitled "Conclusions and Perspec tives," the emphasis is definitely on the latter. There is relatively little re capitulation (as, in any case, the vast bulk of the book is a review of exist ing material). Instead, the authors fin ish by tackling a number of issues to do with the broader implications of Allee effects (e.g., in other disciplines or larger-scale ecological processes such as ecosystem shifts) and define areas of the subject they feel are ripe for further exploration. This is the most individual aspect of the whole book, and, regardless of whether the reader agrees with the authors, is bound to stimulate thought and dis cussion. Unquestionably, this book repre sents a thorough review of published material on Allee effects and will be of great use as a resource for anyone looking for examples within their sys tem of interest, approaches to model ing a given phenomenon, or rapid di gests of previously published papers. In this regard, however, it is disap pointing that the contents and index are not more comprehensive and that there is no index for the cited pub lications. To consider whether the book has greater value than as a re view alone, it is valuable to consider the advances it presents in the con text of three areas that have long un dermined the utility of the Allee ef fect construct. First, a lack of clarity has weakened the term Allee effect (Stephens et al. 1999), proliferating its meanings and making some hesitant to use it. I was pleased to note the authors' efforts to tighten language describing the Allee effect, endorsing the use of Haldane's "positive density dependence" (Hal dane 1953), in preference to the more confusing descriptor "inverse density dependence" (which, at best, serves only to exaggerate the over riding importance of negative density dependence). One area that did dis appoint me, however, was that the authors did not do more to dispel the notion that Allee effects may only be important when the population is so low as to be already inviable. Although they state that, "The be haviors and ensuing dynamics that generate an Allee effect when there are few conspecifics ... shape its life history traits all along the spec trum of population sizes or densities" (p. 15), they also note that Allee ef fects "by definition occur only over a small range of population densities or sizes" (p. 190). They may be talk ing about different phenomena in the two instances (component vs. demo graphic Allee effects, respectively), but, nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that?in theory at least? Allee effects can play an important role over a broad range of population sizes. Second, a common criticism of any preoccupation with Allee effects is that their occurrence (at least at a de mographic level) is poorly supported by empirical data (e.g., Liermann &amp; Hilborn 1997; Gerber &amp; Hilborn 2001). Unfortunately, a critical eval uation of the frequency of occur rence of demographic Allee effects in natural populations is unlikely to be achievable. Estimating mean per capita growth rates requires many data points, especially when popula tion size is low and growth is sub ject to high levels of demographic stochasticity. Unfortunately, if pop ulations are subject to Allee effects, the type of long-term data required to demonstrate those effects are un likely to be available, precisely be cause stochasticity dictates that the population is unlikely to remain for long in the zone of low or negative population growth rates. Moreover, any attempt to survey across stud ies of natural populations is likely to be subject to strong biases: on the one hand, researchers are only likely to mention Allee effects if they are observed; on the other, populations for which meaningful data can be collected at low population densities or sizes are probably those least sus ceptible to Allee effects. In the face of uncertainty regarding the ubiquity of demographic Allee effects, Cour champ et al. can do little but suggest methods by which those effects can be identified. Certainly, this remains an area in which much more work is required if Allee effects are to be taken seriously as a fundamental con servation problem. Last, there are those who ques tion whether knowing that a pop ulation is likely to suffer from an Allee effect makes any genuine differ ence to management. We know that populations should not be allowed to become too small (owing to the dangers of demographic stochastic ity, natural or anthropogenic catas trophes, and genetic threats). What difference does it make if one la bels some of these threats Allee ef fects or identifies one population as more likely to be vulnerable to Allee effects than another? In response, Conservation Biology Volume 22, No. 6, 2008</page><page sequence="3">1664 Courchamp et al. stress the impor tance of acknowledging the poten tial for Allee effects, especially in the modeling that underlies so much of modern conservation and manage ment. They point to four areas in par ticular, in which an acknowledgment of Allee effects is likely to have signif icant implications for management, including target setting for minimum viable populations (MVPs) and strate gies for exploitation, reintroduction (or, conversely, pest control), and metapopulation management. Never theless, without strong evidence that Allee effects become important at greater population sizes than other types of threats, have led to a signif icant number of extinctions, or sig nificantly alter estimates of MVPs, it will be hard to convince skeptics that an appreciation of Allee effects is es sential for practical conservation and management. The last 15 years have seen a rapid increase in the number of studies that have considered positive density dependence, its causes and conse quences. Since the work of Dennis (1989) there have been few signifi cant conceptual advances but much fleshing out of the detail in our under standing. Bringing together the avail able material in one comprehensive and highly readable review is a ma jor achievement and has resulted in a resource that should be of great value to students, researchers, and managers alike. In addition, Allee Ef fects in Ecology and Conservation should act as a springboard for a new approach to studying Allee ef fects and, in particular, a renewed fo cus on the essential questions: how common are Allee effects and what are their practical (rather than the oretical) implications for targets and strategies in conservation and man agement?
