The text is divided into 5 chapters: Patterns of Courtship Behavior, Plumage Pageantry, Display Acrobatics, Wooing by Work, and Mutual Courtship. Each chapter begins with a brief poetic description of the courtship of a species typical of the category being discussed. This serves to interest the reader and to introduce the topic. The first chapter describes the general courtship patterns of birds, and provides an introduction for the rest of the text. Simon discusses species recognition, imprinting, social facilitation (not so named), the effect of light, and aerial courtship. The chapter on Plumage Pageantry discusses how birds use feathers in courtship, and includes de- scriptions of birds of paradise, lyrebirds, and the Great Argus Pheasant. In Display Acrobatics the author describes courtship in grouse, prairie chickens, Ruff, bustard, Ostrich, and manakins. Wooing by Work understandably includes descriptions of bower- birds, frigate birds, penguins, tits, wrens, and weavers. In the chapter on Mutual Court- ship Simon describes Whooping Cranes, swans, geese, ducks, grebes, Jackdaws, and Laughing Gulls. As is obvious from the above list of species, she covers a wide range of species representative of birds in general. As when many non-ornithologists describe avian courtship, she concentrates on the spectacular, showy species whose antics and be- havior fascinate the naturalist in all of us. However, sufficient space is not devoted to the majority of species whose monogamous courtship patterns are less spectacular. This treatment will surely give the naive reader an inaccurate picture of the number of species with spectacular courtship patterns. This solitary failing in the book can be forgiven since its intent is to excite interest, and this it does through a lively writing style and delightful illustrations. Simon's writing is clear and pleasant. She treats such complex behavioral concepts as sexual dimorphism, imprinting, leks, and anthropomorphism well. Her discussion of the role of learning in imprinting, although brief, avoids the usual pitfalls, and she manages to avoid condescension while carefully defining all technical terms. Her writing style is expository, yet poetic. Occasionally her sentences become overly long, sometimes taking an entire paragraph, which may obscure the meaning in some cases. I found the book to be generally accurate, bearing in mind that the descriptions are brief. However a few points need correction in a future edition. Although a bird may well sing to "encourage his mate" (p. 15), we have no way of knowing this. For a further discussion of such topics readers should refer to D. Griffin's recent book The Question of Animal Awareness. Although ethologists argue about the role of males and fenmales, we still do not refer to males as asserting their dominance, to females as childlike (p. 66), or to a female as seeing the "error of her ways" (p. 128) . I know of no ornithologists who "expressed a vague irritation" as they described "the seeming in- difference of the peahen when faced" with the splendor of the male's display (p. 70). The role of males displaying on a lek may be socially facilitating as well as for establish- ing a hierarchy. From my own perspective, the description of Laughing Gull courtship needed editing. I know of no research that indicates that males and females cannot recognize the sex of another Laughing Gull. The charge of a male is to repel intruders, regardless of their sex! The female's appeasement behavior may initiate courtship, but it is not an indication that the male did not perceive her as a female. Additionally, food-begging is not only symbolic in this species, as males do indeed regurgitate food to their mates. Generally, however, the descriptions are accurate, sometimes misleading only because of their brevity. The color illustrations by the author supplement the descriptions, giving the reader a picture both of the bird and the display or behavior being described. Most illustrations are accurate, although the color on some could be slightly improved.

In general, this book is well-written, interesting, fairly accurate, and well-illustrated. I recommend it highly for amateur birders, high-school students, and anyone who enjoys nature. Additionally, it might be very instructive reading some evening for beginning undergraduate ornithology and behavior students.-JOANNA BURGER.</page></plain_text>
