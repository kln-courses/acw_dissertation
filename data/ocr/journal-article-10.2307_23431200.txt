<plain_text><page sequence="1">Natural Monsters: The Genesis and Deformation of the "Experimental Novel" Zena Meadowsong, Stanford University I. The Critical Problem of a Return to Historical Origins In the inaugural issue of this journal, Richard Lehan called for a re turn of critical attention to the "historical metamorphosis that gave life to American literary naturalism—the moment when an agrarian America gave way to an industrial America with its new environment, new values, and new state of mind" ("Naturalism and the Realms of the Text" 20). Reasserting the significance of the specific historical context from which naturalism emerged, Lehan challenged us to reconsider the naturalist text in light of the circumstances, ideas, and beliefs that originally produced it. Arguing that the causal sequence of naturalist plotting resists the re constellations of recent criticism, and charging that such reconfigurations of the text seem to produce a document which is chiefly the end-product of criticism itself, Lehan insisted that we renew a study of naturalism with a return to its declared predicates—to the story, that is, of its ori gins. I would like to take up that challenge here. According to Emile Zola, who first theorized the genre in Le Roman expérimental (1880), naturalism is a "scientific" form improving, in documentary validity, upon the nineteenth-century realist novel. Critics, however, have always debated both the realism of the naturalist text and its relationship to science. The optimism with which Zola greets science in Le Roman expérimental—as the means by which the novelist will fi nally "master certain phenomena of an intellectual and personal or der" (25), just as the scientist "stud[ies] phenomena in order to become their master" (24)—seems inconsistent with the grim matter of novels themselves,1 and the "scientific" realism of his form is widely contested, perhaps most famously by other naturalists. Frank Norris, for example, the "American Zola," called it "a strange perversion" that Zola "should Studies in American Naturalism · Summer 2007. Vol. 2, No. 1 © 2007 Studies in American Naturalism</page><page sequence="2">Studies in American Naturalism be quoted as a realist, and as a realist of realists" ("Zola as a Romantic Writer" 168). Criticism has yet to resolve the apparent conflict between naturalist theory and practice, and some of the best recent work seeks to consider the methodological contradictions as significant in themselves. Focusing upon the formal problems of naturalism, Yves Chevrel and Jennifer Fleissner have both argued that the extremity of the realist enterprise in the naturalist novel ultimately subverts the realism of the project. Chevrel suggests that the narrative attempt to represent a social totality with ideal fidelity is "constantly exposed to the possibility of its being stopped, as narrative" (64) by the exhaustion of the project or the recog nition that it can never be completed. And Fleissner argues that the natu ralist novel succumbs to a kind of obsession-compulsion, suspended, in its very effort to perfect a realist totality, in a repetitive, unsuccessful at tempt to achieve its objects. Both critics, however, read these apparent failures as critique. For Chevrel, as a dysfunctional realism, naturalism demonstrates the dysfunctional nature of the circumstances it represents. For Fleissner, as an obsessive-compulsive realism, naturalism holds out hope for a subversion of defective circumstances—a subversion it cannot yet accomplish. Locating the significance of naturalism in its very contradictions and defects, Chevrel and Fleissner refocus the failures of the naturalist novel as intentional and expressive and allow us to apprehend what criticism has always vaguely articulated—that naturalism draws attention to its own faultiness. If we look at the criticism of naturalism as a whole, this is in deed a dominant note. Even in the dazzling re-constellations of the new historicists, who, as Lehan points out, seem to take apart and reconfigure the text to produce its internal contradictions, there seems to be an essen tial sensitivity or attraction to the underlying strangeness of the text. For Walter Benn Michaels, for example, the "central problem for naturalism" is the "irruption in nature of the powerfully unnatural" (212)—what he calls, in one case, the "unnatural body" of the capitalist "corporation." And Mark Seltzer dwells on the "unnatural Nature of naturalism" (14)— the "body-machine complex" which designates the competition between, and regulation of, forms of production at the turn of the century. Both critics focus on the ways in which the text can be made to "undo" itself; yet their critical maneuvers, orbiting the real historical issues of eco nomic change and technological development, ultimately play upon the traditional narrative of naturalism's historical origins. Indeed, the contra diction in terms so fascinating to both Michaels and Seltzer is built into</page><page sequence="3">Zena Meadowsong the genre as it was first conceived: Zola, in a manner that anticipates Seltzer's "body-machine complex," contends in Le Roman expérimental that "the body of man is a machine, whose machinery can be taken apart and put together again at the will of the experimenter" (16). To call the genre devoted to a "mechanical" view of biology "naturalism" creates an inevitable dissonance between what is traditionally perceived as "natural" (the organic and biological) and "unnatural" (the man-made and mechanical). The naturalist text, constantly drawing attention to its formal and thematic aberrations, is obviously self-rupturing. It not only has but in sists upon its internal contradictions, and this emphasis ultimately seems to demand a Fleissner- or Chevrel-style reading of defect as critique. Moreover, following their lead, if we ask ourselves what defective cir cumstances the naturalist text seeks to expose, we return to the set of his torical problems Lehan considers especially significant—the shift from an agrarian to an industrial society and the shake-up of social norms that resulted from the scientific and technological advancements of the day. We make this return, however, with a new insight—that the formal and thematic problems in the naturalist text arise from and are determined by those historical circumstances. In Fleissner's work, for instance, the naturalist novel is refocused as the drama of female experience in turn-of the-century America, when the increasing rationalization of society pro duced a personal and social dilemma. Able to enter the workforce (partly because of labor-saving machines, which increasingly eliminated physical strength as a criterion for employment), women had the option of be coming productive instead of reproductive citizens and thus threatened society with "race suicide" (3). As a result, Fleissner argues, the naturalist novel is thematically and formally paralyzed—"stuck"·—awaiting the outcome of a conflict between production and reproduction, progress and regress, evolution and degeneration. Fleissner's argument is an illuminating one, not only socio historically, but at the level of form.2 Ingeniously, she links the rationali zation of the text—its excessive commitment to a descriptive realism which finally threatens to undermine and immobilize itself—to the sus pension it dramatizes thematically. Yet in her concern to recenter a nov elistic movement usually associated with male experience around the body of the "new woman," Fleissner may not trace the problem far enough. Instead of tracing naturalism's critique to the "unnatural" woman—the woman who, liberated by machinery from the necessity of reproduction, threatened the race with extinction—we should trace it to</page><page sequence="4">Studies in American Naturalism the machine itself. Among the aberrations of the naturalist text, the ma chine, most of all, draws attention to itself as unnatural. It is the prime mover of Fleissner's unnatural woman; it is responsible for the "unnatural Nature" of Seltzer's "body-machine complex"; it creates the dissonance in the term "naturalism" (which invokes the biological as me chanical); and it implicates, with reference to Zola's theory of the ideally instrumental novel, the "mechanics" of the "experimental" text itself. To what extent can the imaginative materials of fiction be assimilated to an ideal empiricism, and a novel created with the accuracy and impartiality of a machine? According to Le Roman expérimental, the naturalist novel is supposed to be an ideally rationalized form. Yet the perceived failure of rationalization—the failure of realism in the naturalist novel—is not only one of its most striking attributes but often seems to develop around the figure of rationalization itself. In the naturalist texts of Frank Norris and Emile Zola, the failures of empirical form cluster, most em phatically, around the machine. II. Monster Machines In one of the best-known novels of the American tradition, Frank Norris's The Octopus, the machine draws attention to itself as a primary site of formal rupture. Indeed, the rupture is announced in the title. Norris's Octopus is not a "real" octopus but a mythic symbol of the Rail road monopoly in California—and, by métonymie extension, the engine that stands for that monopoly. The Octopus is the machine, and its "unnatural" quality is heralded, not only in the appropriation of a natu ral body (that of a "real" octopus) to the machine, but in the lapse of re alism entailed in the mythic inflation of the figure (the capital O). The Railroad-Octopus is first introduced in a climactic moment early in the novel, when Presley, the visiting poet, witnesses the accidental slaughter of a herd of sheep by a railroad engine. Establishing the novel's most sig nificant mythic pattern, and dramatizing the dynamic relationship be tween myth and realism in the text, this powerful passage is worth quot ing at length: In some way, the herd of sheep . . . had found a breach in the wire fence by the right of way and had wandered out upon the tracks. A band had been crossing just at the moment of the engine's passage. The pathos of it was beyond expression. It was a slaughter, a massacre of innocents. The iron monster had charged full into the midst, merci less, inexorable. To the right and left, all the width of the right of way, the little bodies had been flung; backs were snapped against the fence posts; brains knocked out. Caught in the barbs of the wire, wedged in,</page><page sequence="5">Zena Meadowsong the bodies hung suspended. Under foot it was terrible. The black blood, winking in the starlight, seeped down into the clinkers between the ties with a prolonged sucking murmur. Presley turned away, horror-struck, sick at heart, overwhelmed with a quick burst of irresistible compassion for this brute agony that he could not relieve. The sweetness had gone from the evening, the sense of peace, of security, and placid contentment was stricken from the landscape. The hideous ruin of the engine's path drove all thought of [Presley's] poem from his mind. . . . He hurried across the Los Muertos ranch, almost running, even putting his hands over his ears till he was out of hearing distance of that all but human distress. . . . Then, faint and prolonged, across the levels of the ranch, he heard the engine whistling for Bonneville. Again and again, at rapid intervals in its flying course, it whistled for road crossings, for sharp curves, for trestles; ominous notes, hoarse, bellowing, ringing with the accents of menace and defiance; and abruptly Presley saw again, in his imagina tion, the galloping monster, the terror of steel and steam, with its sin gle eye, cyclopean, red, shooting from horizon to horizon, but saw it now as the symbol of a vast power, huge, terrible, flinging the echo of its thunder over all the reaches of the valley, leaving blood and destruc tion in its path; the leviathan, with tentacles of steel clutching into the soil, the soulless Force, the iron-hearted Power, the monster, the Co lossus, the Octopus. (50-51) The Octopus, here, is unmistakably one of Norris's "big things" of natu ralist Romance—an emblem of the dramatic incidents and effects he considered characteristic of naturalist narrative. The Octopus is "the enormous, the formidable, the terrible" that, according to Norris, "counts" in the naturalist novel ("Zola as a Romantic Writer" 168); it introduces a "vast and fearful catastrophe" of Zolaesque proportions (foreshadowing, in its slaughter of innocents, further catastrophes to come); and its sheer "bigness"—the engine seems to inflate as the mythic associations pile on—announces the failure of "accuracy" in which the realism of the text gives way, in Norris's view, to the superior truths of romance ("Frank Norris's Weekly Letter" 171). Norris's Octopus is not merely a "real" machine, but a "symbol of vast power," and the piling-up of mythic associations drives the point home: the Octopus is also the Co lossus, the Leviathan, and, with its "single eye, cyclopean, red," the Ho meric Cyclops. Realism collapses—must collapse—under the symbolic pressure of the machine. In this piling-up of mythic associations, we might detect an instance of that excess of description under which, as Fleissner and Chevrel argue, the realism of the novel ultimately disintegrates.3 This is clearly the case—yet equally clearly the point. The text draws emphatic attention to</page><page sequence="6">Studies in American Naturalism this failure of realism. Not only is the mythic representation of the ma chine a spectacular, over-determined instance of unrealistic writing, but the passage as a whole seems to dramatize the failure of realistic expres sion. Focalized through Presley, it is inflected by the perspective and, presumably, the diction of the poet. Thus, the narrative language draws specific attention to the poetic apprehension of the scene, and the asser tion that "[t]he pathos of it was beyond expression" heralds a failure of articulation which implies (since the narrative continues) not the failure of language itself, but of realistic language. Though the passage contains a certain amount of documentary prose—the first sentences describe, in realistic detail, the probable causes of the accident (that the sheep had found a gap in a fence and strayed across the railroad tracks)—it is, on the whole, written in a symbolic reg ister initiated with the reference to the inexpressible. The assertion of narrative incapacity is immediately followed by a biblical analogy—the accident is "a slaughter, a massacre of innocents"—which marks a shift from documentary language into a symbolic or allegorical register. Then, undergoing a kind of grotesque inflation in the description of the muti lated sheep—the "little bodies . . . flung [about]; backs . . . snapped against the fence posts; brains knocked out"—it swells to symbolic heights as Presley apprehends "again, in his imagination" the engine as a "galloping monster." Coinciding with the introduction of Presley's imagination, the mythic language in which the accident is finally re described—as the monstrous ravages of the Cyclops, Leviathan, Colos sus, etc.—marks the poetic apprehension of the scene in imaginative terms. The passage gives us, in effect, a record of the way documentary realism falters before the horror of the reality described. The mythologi cal Octopus emerges under the stress of a calamity beyond "realistic" ar ticulation. Though the tendency to dramatize or mythologize, at this moment in the text, may be Presley's, the narrative as a whole adopts the mythic rep resentation of the Railroad-as-Octopus. Presley continues to search, after this incident, for the theme of his projected "Song of the West" (10), but the narrator has found it: the novel is preoccupied, from this point on, with the ramifications of the Octopus, its "huge tentacles . . . silently twisting and advancing, spreading out in every direction, sapping the strength of all opposition" (346). Indeed, the Octopus becomes not only the subject of the novel—the Railroad monopoly that wreaks destruction on the San Joaquin, just as its engine wreaks destruction on the sheep— but the symbol for the story being told. The Octopus adumbrates, in the</page><page sequence="7">Zena Meadowsong twists and turns of its tentacles, the multiple ramifications of the plot— the gradual involvement of San Joaquin wheat farmers, as well as more incidental characters (hop farmers, tenant farmers, etc.), in the toils of the monster. Thus, Presley's mythic apprehension of the machine initi ates and foreshadows the twists and turns of the story. These, always as sociated with the tentacles of the Octopus, continually reassert, and am plify, the mythic discourse of the text. Surprisingly, Norris's use of myth has enjoyed scarcely any critical attention. Where it has been apprehended, it has usually been lumped into a negative assessment of his literary vulgarity and offered as proof of his inability to adhere to the more "scientific" and "deterministic" as pects of the naturalist genre. Michael Davitt Bell, for instance, seems to include it among Norris's "rather limited stock of conventional and in terchangeable clichés about the emergence of 'the brute,' 'the mob,' 'the crushing waters,' whatever" (101). In Bell's view, such aspects of Norris's narrative technique demonstrate a "persistent cultivation of rhetorical melodrama" (101) in default of true naturalism. Norris, he says, "cares very little if at all for factual or 'scientific' detail—for specialized lan guage or, what is far more important, for the specific biological, me chanical, economic, or political processes this language describes" (101). Yet the mythic Octopus—the mythic machine, representing the eco nomic and political machinations of the industrial monopoly of the Cali fornia Railroad—involves all of the "processes" Bell considers appropri ate to naturalism (biology, machinery, economics, and politics). More over, the failure of "factual" or "scientific" detail in the representation of the mythic machine appears to make a formal statement about the ade quacy of such "factual" and "scientific" detail to the representation of naturalist themes. Further, whatever the mythic mode of representation lacks in sub tlety, it is a powerful means of expression, and certainly intentional. Nor ris repeats the mythologizing gesture in The Pit—the sequel to The Octo pus, and the second novel in the Epic of the Wheat series. Here, he represents the Board of Trade building as a huge Sphinx (it ultimately fulfills its mythological role as an arbiter of human destiny) and the wheat pit itself (the trading floor in the Board of Trade building) as a kind of Charybdis—a whirlpool of colossal force. Given the regularity with which Norris makes this gesture in the first two Wheat novels—a gesture which, for convenience, I will call the mythic move—it can probably be assumed that he would have made it again in the third, had he lived long enough to write The Wolf. In fact, given the differences in</page><page sequence="8">10 Studies in American Naturalism plot, scale, and complexity between The Octopus and The Pit, the mythic move is one of the few unifying aspects of the two novels; and though critics like Bell argue that Norris's techniques contradict the tenets of naturalism and fail to abide by the example of his professed master, Zola's novels actually show the same mythic design. In Germinal (1885), for instance—one of the best-known novels in the naturalist Rougon Macquart sequence—Norris's mythic machine appears in Zola. The coal mine, Le Voreux, is described as "this greedy, squatting god, who fed off the flesh of 10,000 hungry people who didn't even know him" (71).4 The resemblance between Zola's "squatting god" and Norris's "Octopus" may be a matter of influence.5 There are, in fact, striking similarities between the god and the Octopus: both, of course, are me chanical; both appear at a climactic moment early in the text (the end of Part I of Germinal, and the end of the first long section of The Octopus)·, both are focalized through a figure new to the given environment (Etienne Lantier in Germinal, Presley in The Octopus)·, and both initiate a struggle. Etienne decides that he "want[s] to go back down into the mine to suffer and struggle" (71) with the people Le Voreux consumes, and Presley—more and more appalled by the depredations of the Octopus— turns socialist and anarchist in bursts of poetic opposition to the ma chine. In light of the structural and rhetorical similarities, it is arguable that Norris borrowed the mythic move—together with the industrial situa tion that produces it—from Zola. Yet the emergence of the symbolic pattern that organizes Norris's novels in those of Zola is especially sig nificant. The problem of a mythic rupture in the naturalist novel is ar guably more disturbing in Zola, who himself theorized naturalism as a "scientific" form of documentary validity, free of imaginary situations and composed in plain language. In Le Roman expérimental, Zola asserts that "the experimental method in letters, as in the sciences, is in the way to explain the natural phenomena, both individual and social, of which metaphysics, until now, has given only irrational and supernatural expla nations" (54). Yet the "squatting god" of Germinal appears to continue an "irrational and supernatural" account of material circumstances, in direct contradiction to the theoretical premises of the "experimental" novel.6 As in Norris's Octopus, the mythic rupture of Germinal is anything but accidental. The representation of the insatiable, god-like mine organ izes the entire text. As Irving Howe has observed, it is the "symbolic cen ter" of the novel, a figure for the "suffering and struggle" (288) to which</page><page sequence="9">Zena Meadowsong 11 Etienne commits himself when he decides to stay in the mining district of Montsou—a struggle which in turn defines the nature and direction of the whole plot of the novel (in which a mining community is finally driven, by the severity of the circumstances Le Voreux represents, to or ganize a revolt). Interestingly, however, Howe locates the "mythic" ele ment of Germinal, not in the representation of the mine, but in the grad ual formation of a "collective consciousness" (288) among the miners. Germinal is, according to Howe, the myth of the self-realization of la bor—the story of the proletarian discovery that "not in mines or factories lie the sources of their troubles but in the historically determined rela tions between contending classes" (287). In this view, the mine is merely "a physical emblem of the impersonality of commodity produc tion" (287), a "force bursting out of the control of its creators" (287). It is a giant mystification—a monster born of the alienation of labor. In its anthropomorphism, it discloses its human origin—the fact that it was created by men. In its monstrosity, however, it also occludes that origin, mystifying the human source of the suffering it imposes. In this reading, Zola's mythic mine is in a sense the most "natural" of possible figures in the novel. "As always in Germinal" Howe writes, "the mythic and symbolic are of the very substance of the historical" (287). Le Voreux, made by men, appears to have been unleashed upon mankind by some superior power; yet its mythic inflation really represents the irra tionality—the mystification, the not-knowing—that erupts in the hu man process of rationalization, and the horrible irony of scientific ad vancements that, meant to relieve labor and exploit Nature for the good of humanity, only enslave individuals to machines. It represents, in short, certain paradoxes of modern experience, and the novel expresses these paradoxes of experience as a paradox of form. Since the authentic representation of the machine is irrational, the rational form—the "scientific," "experimental" method of the naturalist novel—must resort to myth for successful expression. Thus, the realism of the representation entails a failure of realism, and the naturalist novel achieves its ostensible object—by sacrificing it. Here, we return—through the mythic ruptures of The Octopus and Germinal—to the question of naturalism as a failed, or defective, form. The prevailing critical impression that there is something wrong with the naturalist novel is apparently justified by the mythic machines of Norris and Zola. Yet the emphasis that the novels themselves place on this os tensible failure compels our attention. Zola, in Le Roman expérimental, projected a day in which the scientist—and afterwards the experimental</page><page sequence="10">12 Studies in American Naturalism novelist, by "an inevitable evolution" (16)—would come to understand, and thereby master, the circumstances of the material world. Yet the naturalist novel, as he writes it, ultimately functions as a limit case for this theory. Pursuing the documentary "experiment" to its logical con clusion, the novel finally "bursts out of control" like the machine it represents, its "scientific" strategy disintegrating under the pressure of "real" conditions. The monstrous machines of the real world can only be represented through a rupture of realist form, as fidelity of description, requiring a mythic mode of representation, disrupts the rational "experiment" of the novel. Thus, what criticism has often perceived as a failure of execution is actually the formal drama of the novel putting it self through the paradoxes of modern experience: rationality produces irrationality, mastery produces subjection, realism produces myth. The monster machine, rupturing the realistic text, is ultimately the emblem and agent of an acute industrial realism, exposing the ironic conse quences of a "scientific" method which, in both "real" life and naturalis tic fiction, bursts out of the control of its creators. III. The Natural Tyranny of the Machine: Naturalism and the Man-made World In the naturalist novels of Norris and Zola, as in the real, historical world they represent, the machine is developed to overcome the prob lems of Nature—to triumph, in the engine, over space and time, or to exploit, in the mine, the buried possibilities of the earth. Yet, ironically, the machine exposes human subjects anew to the exigencies of the natu ral world. Built to master Nature, the machine itself turns master, exer cising the tyranny that Nature once exercised, and as indifferent to hu man fate. Thus, in The Octopus, Presley is appalled by the machine's im position of a "brute agony he could not relieve" (50)—the irremediable agony of "animal" existence—and is gradually impressed by the me chanical quality of the organic world: "Indifferent, gigantic, resistless, it moved in its appointed grooves" (448). The San Joaquin Valley responds to mechanical cultivation, the soil "passionate under the rude embrace [of| a multitude of iron hands" (130), and Presley finally apprehends Nature as a machine, identical to the Octopus itself: "Nature was, then, a gigantic engine, a vast cyclopean power, huge, terrible, a leviathan with a heart of steel, knowing no compunction, no forgiveness, no toler ance" (576—77). Instead of conquering Nature, the Octopus reproduces, in its own image, the threatening vastness of the natural world. The ma chine re-erects the threat of Nature in the naturalist novel—but the</page><page sequence="11">Zena Meadowsong 13 threat of Nature man-made. As Richard Lehan has asked us to recall, naturalism records "the mo ment when an agrarian America gave way to an industrial America with its new environment, new values, and new state of mind." Indeed, to draw attention to the crucial word here, it is the novel of this precise his torical moment, commemorating the onset of this condition. The mon strousness of the naturalist machine reflects the shock with which man kind apprehends the fruits of its own rationalization, and the stark con trast between the new problems (the horror of the machine) and the old ones (the battle with Nature) confers a faintly edenic quality upon by gone circumstances. Thus, in The Octopus, when Presley first apprehends the Railroad as a monster, the engine performs a biblical "slaughter of innocents" and accomplishes, symbolically, the demolition of a pastoral mode (literally colliding with and annihilating a sheep-herd). The lan guage and imagery are nostalgic, mourning a vanquished order; yet this nostalgia is primarily generated out of the ugliness and brutality of the machine. Presley knows nothing about the methods (traditional or other wise) of farming and herding sheep; rather, the power of his vision de rives from an apprehension of the violence of the man-made world. A simple, agrarian landscape, in which Nature is confronted directly, gives way in the collision between the sheep-herd and the engine to an indus trial system which resurrects the tyranny of Nature in its own machines. This shift from an agrarian to an industrial society, and from the tyr anny of Nature to the man-made tyranny of the machine, is the primal story of the naturalist novel as written by Norris and Zola. Moreover, though it is perhaps most pronounced in the works of these writers, we see a similar preoccupation—together with a similar mythic tendency— in the compositions of other naturalists. It looms in the hellish atmos phere of Davis's "Life in the Iron Mills," in the pervasive religious im agery of Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, and in the "superhuman" glitter of the city in Dreiser's Sister Carrie. In these texts, myth may or may not erupt, or only mutedly, in the figure of the machine.7 Yet what ever its source—the machine, the factory, the city, the war—it seems in evitably connected to the struggle with Nature (the struggle to be fed, clothed, safe, and, if possible, sexually replete) in a man-made environ ment, and to arise out of the documentary impulses of the genre. In each of these works, realism gives way to myth in the representation of a mon strous or overwhelming reality. The mythic ruptures of Norris's The Oc topus or Zola's Germinal would thus seem to be characteristic of natural ist narrative, merely epitomizing the formal contradictions that every</page><page sequence="12">14 Studies in American Naturalism where result from the empirical aims of the genre. In a mythic figure like the monster machine (or the mill, the war, or the city), the naturalist novel both creates and, in a formal sense, becomes a monster. Yet this monstrosity, demonstrating its internal commitment to the problematic realities of its day, is a major source of its representational power. To understand naturalism as it needs to be understood—as the prod uct of a specific historical period, and a changing world—is to accept its monstrosity. To go back to historical origins is, as we have seen, to rein vigorate old, irresolvable problems—contradictions between theory and practice, bugbears of aesthetic vulgarity or inconsistency. Yet the natural ist novel has always called attention to its deformities, signaling the sig nificance of its apparent defects. What we need now, and are indeed be ginning to distinguish in recent accounts, is a critical practice willing to respond to the naturalist text as written, unconcerned to resolve or do away with the formal problems that draw attention to themselves as such. We need to look at the deformations of the naturalist novel, not as embarrassments of taste or form, but as crucial to the project with which it is engaged, and an index of the historical problems—among them, the ironies of industrialization, and the man-made deformations of the natu ral world—that produced it. NOTES 1. Whereas Zola looks forward in Le Roman expérimental to the day in which "science advances and . . . the conquest of the unknown is finally com pleted," foreseeing a "time [when] the doctor will be the master of maladies [and] will cure without fail" and when "man, grown more powerful, will make use of nature and will utilize its laws to produce upon the earth the greatest pos sible amount of justice and freedom" (24), his novels are consistently devoted to irremediable maladies, the inevitability of social corruption, and congenital criminality. Indeed, so pessimistic is the vision of the novels, and so at odds with the theoretical conception of naturalism, that the idea of an "experimental novel" survives today mainly as an example of the inadequacy of naturalist the ory to explain naturalism itself. Yet to dispense with the "scientific" novel en tirely would mean abandoning an enquiry into naturalism's relationship to real ism (upon which, according to Zola, it sought to improve) and the precise his torical changes—the scientific and technological developments—upon which Zola insisted and to which Richard Lehan now seeks to return our attention. 2. One of Fleissner's most important contributions to the critical history of naturalism is to locate women, and female experience, at the heart of the genre. As Donna Campbell demonstrates in '"Where are the ladies?' Wharton, Glas gow, and American Women Naturalists," works like Fleissner's are beginning to</page><page sequence="13">Zena Meadowsong 15 diversify the prevailing account of naturalism, "extending] the boundaries . . . in ways that facilitate a rereading of [works by women] as naturalist texts" and reconsidering women, so long "relegated to the 'and also' category of naturalist authors" (152-53), as significant figures in the genre. 3. This critique was, of course, originally levied by Georg Lukács in his in fluential essay "Narrate or Describe?" (1936). According to Lukács, Zola under takes a descriptive, documentary project which, in its very extremity, produces a "chaos" of detail under which the narrative impulse of the naturalist novel foun ders. This complaint, based on a contrast between naturalism and earlier forms of realism, is essentially political: Lukács feels that the naturalist novel substi tutes "static" description for agency, producing, in lieu of narrative action, "still lives" (130) which accept the state of society—specifically, the bourgeois society of late nineteenth-century France—as given. Chevrel and Fleissner both take up Lukács's argument but, instead of denouncing naturalism for its failed realism, they reassess such failures as a critique of the status quo. 4. In the original French, this passage reads, "à ce dieu repu et accroupi, au quel dix mille affamés donnaient leur chair, sans le connaître' (1193). 5. I am not, of course, the first to note the similarity between Norris's ma chines and Zola's. Donald Pizer identifies "Zola's influence on Norris's depic tion of destructive railroad engines and on his practice of animalizing ma chines" (163) in Realism and Naturalism in Nineteenth-Century American Litera ture, and gives a full account of Zola's influence on The Octopus in The Novels of Frank Norris. In the latter work, he argues that Norris "drew upon Zola for such matters as the metaphor of the railroad engine as an animal (La Bête hu maine?)" (126) and distinguishes, as I do, structural similarities between The Oc topus and Germinal. Similarly, in their recent biography of Norris, Joseph R. McElrath and Jesse Crisler observe that "Zola regularly personified and invested vitalistic characteristics in machines of all kinds: trains in La Bête humaine, the distilling apparatus behind old Colombe's bar in L'Assommoir, and the Voreux mine of Germinal," and remark that these "fanciful demonstrations of the pa thetic fallacy were ... an inspiration for Norris" (170). 6. Indeed, published five years after Le Roman expérimental (1880), Germi nal (1885) might be expected to abide by the proscriptions of Zola's theoretical essay. 7. In Davis, of course, the mythic imagery of the iron mills—a hellish "city of fires" full of "pits of flame waving in the wind; wide caldrons filled with boil ing fire ... ; [and] crowds of half-clad men, like revengeful ghosts in the red light" (1218)—is intimately connected to machinery, and, aptly enough, to the very industrial processes that supply the raw materials of the railroad, Norris's Octopus. In Crane, somewhat more surprisingly, the youth at one point appre hends enemy forces as "machines of steel" in their unrelenting advance and waits in terror for this "onslaught of redoubtable dragons" (39). Here, however, the metaphors (conflating monsters and machines) do not so much implicate the tyranny of the machine as decry, through the metaphor of the tyrannical machine, the man-made and inexorable quality of war.

Here, the tyranny of the machine is more a matter of its emphatically unromantic attributes—its "humdrum, mechanical move ment" (28) and the "common" quality of its female operators. Carrie has "more imagination than they" (40), and her escape from the factory tends to mytholo gize, not the machine, but the power of the commercial city she is ultimately able to exploit. However, she remains conscious of the "underworld of toil" (140) from which she has escaped, and the machine retains mythic associa tions as an emblem of this extremity. Hurstwood's tramcar, like Carrie's ma chine, remains a mere unromantic tramcar throughout the Brooklyn strike (I am grateful for this observation to Stephen C. Brennan); yet it marks his grow ing distance from the urban glamour to which Carrie ascends, and his proximity to the "underworld of toil" from which she has been released. Moreover, propel ling him into the mêlée of competition for urban survival, the machine hastens his confrontation with the exigencies of Nature in the man-made environment, accelerating his decline into the animal condition (homeless and hungry) to which he finally gives in with the help of the flophouse gaslight.
