<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUME'S CRITICISM OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN This paper is concerned with the question: 'Did Philo in Hume's Dialogues1 succeed in undermining Cleanthes' argument from design?* Hume's commentators have differed on their an swers.2 Norman Kemp Smith speaks of Philo's destructive criticism as "final and complete."3 And Professor Bernard Williams, in a recent symposium devoted to Hume, says that "although the argu ment from Design lingered on through the nineteenth century, and even to the present time, Hume undermined it in a thoroughgoing and definitive manner."4 Professor Al vin Plantinga, on the other hand, while conceding that Hume had succeeded in pointing out differences between the universe and things we know to be de signed, nevertheless concludes that "there seems to be no reason to think that these differences ruin the argument."5 I shall argue that Hume did not undermine the argument from design. The Argument From Design The argument is presented by Cleanthes in Part II Look round the world; contemplate the whole and every part of it: you will find it to be nothing but one great machine, sub divided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions, to a degree beyond what human senses and IAH references are to David Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, edited with an introduction by Norman Kemp Smith (New York, 1947). Herein after cited as DNR. 2 They have also differed as to whether Philo or Cleanthes is Hume. I am convinced by Norman Kemp Smith "that Philo from start to finish represents Hume" (p. 59) and shall, therefore, take the liberty throughout this paper of using the terms 'Philo* and 'Hume' interchangeably. 3 DNR, p. 30. 4 D.

All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy, which ravishes into admiration all men, who have ever contemplated them, the curious adopting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the author of nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work, which he has executed. By this argument a posteriori and by this argument alone, we do prove at once the existence of a Deity, and his similarity to human mind and intelligence.6 This argument has two conclusions. First, the universe as an ordered system is the product of design, and, secondly, the world designer resembles the human mind but possesses far greater wis dom, power and intelligence. The argument to the first conclusion is, in my opinion, a straightforward inductive one. Cleanthes speaks of the adjustment of parts, the adapting of means to ends as charac teristics of objects which, in the case of human productions, are known to originate from design. Consequently human productions serve as a sample class from which an inference can be made regarding other objects which exhibit these very same properties, such as the universe and its parts, as also having originated from design. My position is the same as that of John Stewart Mill. The design argument is not drawn from mere resemblances in nature to the works of human intelligence, but from the special character of those resemblances. The circumstances in which it is alleged that the world resembles the works of men are not circum stances taken at random, but are particular instances of a circum stance which experience shows to have a real connection with an intelligent origin?the fact of conspiring to an end. The argument therefore is not one of mere analogy. As mere analogy it has its weight, but it is more than analogy?it is an inductive argument.7 ? DNR, p. 143, Italics in text. 7 John Stewart Mill, Theism (New York, 1957), p. 29.</page><page sequence="3">272 LEON PEARL In accordance with the above consideration, Cleanthes' argu ment to his first conclusion might be formulated in the following way: (1) All objects possessing order in which the origin of order is known are human productions. (2) The order in human products originates from intelligent de sign. (3) The universe, its parts and sub parts possess order. Therefore, (4) Probably the order in the universe originated from intelligent design. The reasoning from (4) to the second conclusion is no different from that employed in comparing two human products for the pur pose of ascertaining the differences in knowledge and ability of the two men who constructed them. The rest of Cleanthes' argument is: (5) The order in the universe "much exceeds the productions of human contrivance." Therefore, (6) Probably the designer of the world "is somewhat similar to the mind of man: though possessed of much larger faculties."8 I shall be concerned with Philo's criticisms only insofar as they are directed against the argument from (1) to (4). Objections in Part II of the Dialogues Hume's objections to the argument from design here are in tended to undermine the inference on the ground that the universe is unique and can not be significantly compared to a human prod uct. There are however two inferences in Cleanthes' argument and it is not apparent which of the two is being challenged. The inference to (6) presupposes that one could compare the universe to a human product in order to discover something about the nature of the world designer besides the mere fact that he has intelligence. And what Philo might be insisting upon by his objections is that the disanalogy between the universe and a human product is so great that any comparison between them for this purpose is impos sible. This, even if true, does not necessarily undermine the infer ence to (4). The situation here would be no different from that o? a 8DNR, p. 143.</page><page sequence="4">hume's criticism of the design argument 273 space traveler discovering an object in a distant planet which he has reason to believe is the product of design. However, because the object is so very different from that of any human product and because he knows nothing of the circumstances involved in its construction, he is in no position to make a legitimate inference regarding the nature of the designer other than the fact that he possesses intelligence. It seems to me that, while Philo's criticisms in Part II might have undermined the inference to (6), it failed to do so regarding the inference to (4). His first objection, immediately following Cleanthes' presenta tion of the argument from design is as follows: If we see a house, Cleanthes, we conclude, with the greatest cer tainty, that it has an architect or builder; because this is precisely that species of effect which we have experienced to proceed from that species of cause. But surely you will not affirm, that the uni verse bears such a resemblance to a house, that we can with the same certainty infer a similar cause, or that the analogy is here entire and perfect. The dissimilitude is so striking, that the utmost you can here pretend to is a guess, a conjecture, a presumption concerning a similar cause; ... 9 The inference to a world designer is obviously not as strong as to that of a builder from having observed a house. But why should the dissimilitude between the world and a house reduce the conclusion to *a mere guess or conjecture'? No premiss in the argument stated, that there is a resemblance between a human product and the world, except in the single respect that both exhibit order; and this latter fact is not challenged in this objection. Perhaps Philo's point is that the inference is worthless because it is grounded on a resem blance in the single respect of exhibiting order. But it is not grounded on this resemblance chosen at random, as Mill pointed out, but rather on the premiss that exhibiting order is known to arise from design and from no other source. Another objection by Philo in Part II is: But can you think, Cleanthes, that your usual phlegm and philosophy have been preserved in so wide a step as you have taken, when you compared to the universe houses, ships, furniture, ma chines; and from their similarity in some circumstances inferred a ? DNR, p. 144.</page><page sequence="5">274 LEON PEARL similarity in their causes? Thought, design, intelligence, such as we discover in men and other animals, is no more than one of the springs and principles of the universe, as well as heat or cold, attraction or repulsion, and a hundred others, which fall under daily observation. It is an active cause, by which some particular parts of nature, we find, produce alterations on other parts. But can a conclusion, with any propriety, be transferred from parts to the whole? Does not the great disproportion bar all comparison and inference? From observing the growth of a hair, can we learn anything concerning the generation of a man.10 Is Philo objecting to any inference from parts to whole? But we obviously do make on occasion proper inferences of this sort. From our having observed in a random sample, white houses and none of another color, we correctly conclude that the whole town consists of white houses. Perhaps the objection is not to every inference from part to whole but to this particular one on the ground that there is a significant disanalogy in the terms specifying the causal relation in the premises from those in the conclusion. In the premises the terms are human agents and human products both of which are parts of the universe but in the conclusion it is a world designer who is not part of the universe and the universe as a whole. This disanalogy, however, is simply an instance of a kind which holds between terms involved in the origin of any organizational system from those in the interaction between the parts of a system. And we do sometimes make proper inferences from parts to whole of this type. We often correctly infer from the causal interactions between the parts of a machine to the purpose for which, and the manner by which, the machine as a whole was constructed. Hume's point is perhaps that the inference is improper, because intelligence is chosen as the sole principle for the origin of the universe from a very large number of others such as heat, attraction and repulsion, which are observed to operate on a much vaster scale, between the parts of the universe, than intelligence. But the conclusion of the argument from design is not that intelligence is the sole principle for the origin of the universe but rather that it is the one principle that explains the fact that the world exhibits order. For all that we know there may have been any number of principles involved in lODNR,p. 147.</page><page sequence="6">hume's criticism of the design argument 275 the origin of the universe. Intelligence is not a principle like heat or attraction but rather involves the use of such principles for certain purposes. The choice of intelligent design, therefore, is not a choice of one principle from a large number of others but rather between the generation of the universe as a goal directed activity and its origin in a non purposive manner. There is still another objection in Part II made by Philo: When two species of objects have always been observed to be con joined together, I can infer, by custom, the existence of one wher ever I see the existence of the other: And this I call an argument from experience. But how this argument can have place, where the objects, as in the present case, are single, individual, without parallel, or specific resemblance, may be difficult to explain. And will any man tell me with a serious countenance, that an orderly universe must arise from some thought and art, like the human; because we have experience of it? To ascertain this reasoning, it were requisite, that we had experience of the origin of worlds; and it is not sufficient surely, that we have seen ships and cities arise from human art and contrivance ... 11 Why should Philo not allow a causal argument to the origin of order in the universe on the ground that the universe is singular and unique? The latter is trivially true of every object. The uni verse also, like every other object, falls under many species for example it falls under the species of being large, possessing many parts. Perhaps Philo meant that the term 'universe' can be satisfied by one and only one entity and hence it is logically inconceivable that someone observed the genesis of a succession of universes in order to warrant an inference from experience regarding the pre sent one. This objection is too strong for 'the fattest man presently on Canal Street' can be satisfied by one and only one entity and surely one can discover from experience how he originated. Hume might have meant that the only significant class term under which the universe falls is 'universe', and since no one has as a matter of fact observed universes in formation, an argument from experience as to its origin is unwarranted. The significance of a class term, however, is relative to the purposes of classification and inference. If you are trying to persuade an ambitious space traveler that he could il DNR, p. 149 and 150, Italics in text.</page><page sequence="7">276 LEON PEARL not traverse the spatial area of the universe in a lifetime, then the significant class term here is 'larger than the solar system'. The significant class term in the argument from design is not 'universe* but rather 'object possessing order', because it is insofar as the universe falls under the latter term that the conclusion is drawn that its order originated from design. The argument from design, seems to me, to be an "argument from experience,, in Hume's sense of the term. And the reason for this is because we had observed many objects possessing order originating from design and never from any other source. Hume's criticisms in Part II would seem to indicate his failure to realize that the argument from design is essentially inductive and not analogical in Mill's sense of these terms. Professor Alvin Plan tinga suggests that even against an inductive argument Philo's criticisms can have a point. It can be taken as a negative response to the question as to "whether its sample class resembles the reference class minus the sample class sufficiently to support an inference of any strength at all."12 One of Hume's examples of a weak inductive argument can serve as illustrating Plantinga's point. "When we infer the circulation of the sap in vegetables from our experience that the blood circulates in animals,"13 the sample class consists of animals, the reference class living substances, and the strength of the inference depends on the resemblance between animals and (the reference class minus the sample class) vegetables. What re sembling characteristics are, in Hume's example, relevant for the determination of the strength of the inference? Surely not color or size or any other property simply chosen at random. In this par ticular case we can more or less determine the strength of the inference because we possess prior knowledge as to which character istics (other than the mere possession of life) might possibly be relevant to the circulation of blood or sap. There are indeed many differences between the universe and a human artifact but there is no background knowledge as to the relative weights to be given these differences in order to determine the strength of the inference to design. With reference to the argument from design the question would then appear to be: given that we possess no background 12 GOM, p. 106. 13DNR, p. 144.</page><page sequence="8">hume's criticism of the design argument 277 knowledge about universes to estimate the strength of the inference to design, does it possess "any strength at all"? By 'the minimum strength of an inference* I mean that a rational person who ac cepted the premises with certainty would, on the basis of the pre mises alone, accept the conclusion with reservations. In the light of the above let us substitute (4), (in which the term 'probably' merely signified that the inference was not deductive) for: (4') It is more likely than not that the order in the universe originated from intelligent design. No doubt Hume was right in that disanalogies between the world and human artifacts makes the argument from design a weak one. The fact, for instance, that living organisms, unlike human products, are self-repairing and reproducing machines weakens the inference; and this is so despite the fact that we have no prior knowledge to estimate the significance of this disanalogy. The ques tion that concerns us, however, is whether the inference to (4') is proper? And it appears to me that precisely because we have no prior knowledge that the disanalogies count against the inference, the inference is proper. A Martian who had absolutely no prior knowledge of the ways and mannerisms of humans, and who ob served that the first five women he saw wore mini skirts, would be justified in inferring, despite his knowledge that an inference from such a limited sample is a weak one, that it is more likely than not that all female humans wear mini skirts. What makes this inference proper is that if, immediately after his limited sampling, the Mar tian had to make a practical decision involving the issue as to whether women wear mini skirts as a relevant consideration, it would be rational for him to act on the supposition that they do rather than they do not. It appears to me that where there is no prior knowledge about a subject matter, weak inductive inferences can be taken as having a minimum strength. And I really see no reason why this should not apply to the argument from design. Objections in Part IV to VIII At no point in the Dialogues does Hume challenge the premiss that the world has "the appearance of art and contrivance"; but instead develops a number of alternative hypothesis to design in order to account for this very appearance. His contention being that there simply is no criterion by which one theory about the origin of</page><page sequence="9">278 LEON PEARL order is preferable to another and, consequently, "a total suspense of judgment is here our only reasonable resource."14 The advocate of the design hypotheses will, of course, claim that the argument from design provides grounds for accepting his hypothesis. But Hume's response to this is that arguments of equal weight can be provided for alternative hypotheses. In Part IV Hume first intro duces the theme that matter might "contain the principle of its order within itself." This theme is developed in Parts VI, VII and VIII where two different hypothesis are presented. The first is the old stoic doctrine that the world is a living organism, and the second is what Hume calls "the Epicurean hypothesis," which tries to account for the order in the cosmos as a result of the eternal motion of the bodies that comprise it. Philo begins his criticism in Part IV with the remark that he intends to prove that "there is no ground to suppose a plan of the world to be found in the divine mind consisting of distinct ideas." Such a ground must either be supplied a priori or by experience. A priori "a mental world or universe of ideas requires a cause as much as does a material world or universe of objects."15 Again, when we will need force experience to pronounce some sentence, even on these subjects, which lie beyond her sphere; neither can she perceive any material difference in this particular, between these two kinds of worlds, but finds them to be governed by similar principles, and to depend upon an equal variety of causes in their operations. We have specimens in miniature of both of them. Our own mind resembles the one: A vegetable or animal body the other. Let experience, therefore, judge from these sam ples. Nothing seems more delicate with regard to its causes than thought. ... As far as we can judge, vegetables and animal bodies are not more delicate in their motions, nor depend upon a great er variety or more curious adjustment of springs and principles.16 Philo concludes from the above that the advocate of the design hypothesis will either fall into an infinite regress or beg the point at issue. 14 DNR, p. 186 and 187. 15 DNR, p. 160. ?

Have we not the same reason to trace that ideal world into another ideal world, or new intelligent principle? But if we stop, and go no farther; why go so far? Why not stop at the material world? How can we satisfy ourselves without going on in infinitum? ...17 To say, that the different ideas, which compose the reason of the supreme Being, fall into order, of themselves, and by their own nature, is really to talk without any precise meaning. If it has a meaning, I would fain know, why it is not as good sense to say, that the parts of the material world fall into order, of themselves, and by their own nature? Can the one opinion be intelligible, while the other is not so?18 An assumption which is central to Hume's criticism is that a plan in a person's mind consists of distinct ideas arranged in an orderly manner. Consequently designing for Hume turns out to be an activity by which the order among the ideas (the plan) is duplicated among material bodies. The assumption does not seem to me to be true. I am inclined to believe that just as it makes no sense to say that the idea of a red triangle is itself both red and triangular, equally it makes no sense to say that the idea or plan of a machine is itself an orderly organization of ideas. I really do not know what could possibly be meant by speaking of a man's ideas as orderly or disorderly other than that his ideas objectively signify some state of affairs which would be orderly or disorderly. But even if Hume's assumption was true, his criticism does not undermine the argument from design. For the conclusion of that argument left the question as to whether the ideas in the world designer's mind "contains the principle of its order within itself" an open one. Whether the ideas first arranged themselves into an orderly system in his mind, or he acquired the plan of the world from some other mind, in either case the argument from design established what it intended to do, namely that the world is the product of design. Furthermore, Hume is mistaken in claiming that 17 DNR, p. 161 and 162, Italics in text. 18 DNR, p. 162.</page><page sequence="11">280 LEON PEARL because the plans in men's minds have causes, we have no grounds from experience for believing that order is more likely to belong originally to mind than matter. Hume is confusing the originality of a plan with its being uncaused. From experience we know that certain plans are originally formed in some men's minds despite the fact that we have reason to believe that certain causal conditions were both necessary and sufficient for the origin of these plans. But, on the other hand, whenever we observe order in matter originate from a nonorderly state, as in the case of human productions, the order is in all cases imposed from without. Perhaps Hume's point is that the hypothesis of a world designer is unsatisfactory on the ground that it is not an ultimate causal explanation (in that there may have been causes for the occurrence of the plan in the world designer's mind), or provides an initial step for the discovery of such an explanation. But in that case all causal explanations should be unsatisfactory for Hume. In the Inquiry, speaking of the search for principles of greater generality in natural philosophy, he says: "But as to the causes of these general causes, we should in vain attempt their discovery . . . these ultimate springs and principles are totally shut up from human curiosity and in quiry . . . the most perfect philosophy of the natural kind staves off our ignorance a little longer. . . ."19 Hume does not think that causal explanations in natural philosophy are defective, or that we ought not to search for them because "they stave off our ignorance a little longer." But then why should he object to explanations in theology for this very reason? The same point, as above, was made by Cleanthes and Philo answered him by drawing a distinction between the design hypo thesis and those found in natural philosophy. Naturalists indeed very justly explain particular effects by more general causes; though these general causes themselves should re main in the end totally inexplicable: But they never surely thought it satisfactory to explain a particular effect by a particular cause, which was no more to be accounted for than the effect itself.20 l?

Hendel (New York, 1955), p. 45. 20DNR, p. 164.</page><page sequence="12">hume's criticism of the design argument 281 In the design hypothesis we do not merely have a particular effect being explained by a particular cause. The explanatory value of a world designer is that it is taken to be an instance of the general proposition that all objects that exhibit order are the prod ucts of design. Furthermore it is not apparent why Hume should object to explanations in which a particular effect is explained by a particular cause, where the cause itself cannot be accounted for. We consider many such explanations to be perfectly proper. The flash ing of a ghost image in Tom's mind is a perfectly good explanation for his sudden burst of fear despite the fact that no one is likely to give an account as to why the cause should have occurred. There are, of course, differences, as Hume insists, between the design hy pothesis and those found in natural philosophy, but I see no reason why this fact shows the design hypothesis to be defective. Philo in Part VI begins his development of the hypothesis that the world is a living organism with the remark that besides the principle "that like effects arise from like causes," there is another sound principle: "that where several known circumstances are ob served to be similar, the unknown will also be found similar."21 And applying this latter principle he says: Now if we survey the universe, so far as it falls under our knowl edge, it bears a great resemblance to an animal or organized body, and seems actuated with a like principle of life and motion. A continual circulation of matter in it produces no disorder: A continual waste in every part is incessandy repaired: The closest sympathy is perceived throughout the entire system: . . . the world, therefore, I infer, is an animal, and the Deity is the soul of the world, actuating it, and actuated by it.22 In what sense can Hume's point be considered a criticism of the argument from design? For supposing the world is an animal, then the very same hypothesis of a world designer, which is used to account for turtles and dogs as exhibiting order, would be needed to account for the world as an organized living body. The hypothesis of the world as a living organism is further developed in Part VII: 21DNR, p. 170, Italics in text. 22DNR,p.l70andl71.</page><page sequence="13">282 LEON PEARL If the universe bears a greater likeness to animal bodies and to vegetables than to the works of human art, it is more probable that its cause resembles the cause of the former than that of the latter, and its origin ought rather to be ascribed to generation or vegetation than to reason or design.23 But there is a significant difference between the origin of human products as a result of design from that of vegetables and animals by processes which Hume calls "vegetation" and "generation." In the case of design, materials which are in a nonorderly state are transformed into an organized system; but in the case of vegetation or generation, this is not the case. What we find instead is a process by which organized bodies generate other organized bodies. There is no genesis of order here, but rather its transmission from one body to another. Generation and vegetation are themselves orderly processes which the argument from design tries to account for. So that even supposing one of these processes were the means by which the universe originated, this would in no way constitute an alterna tive to the design hypothesis. The point, I am trying to make, is that vegetation and generation, unlike design, do not provide ex planations for the existence of orderly systems and processes but are, in fact, themselves illustrations of that very order which requires explanation. To be sure, it is logically possible that matter "con tains the principle of its order within itself." But until such an explanatory principle is actually developed, there is no alternative hypothesis to design from that quarter. Hume in Part VIII offers "the Epicurean hypothesis" by asking us to consider the possibility that matter may have been in motion throughout eternity. And then adds: Thus the universe goes on for many ages in a continued succes sion of chaos and disorder. But is it not possible that it may settle at last, so as not to lose its motion and active force (for that we have supposed inherent in it), yet so as to preserve a uniformity of appearance, amidst the continual motion and fluctuation of its parts? This we find to be the case with the universe at present. Every individual is perpetually changing, and every part of every indi vidual, and yet the whole remains, in appearance, the same. May we not hope for such a position, or rather be assured of it, from the 23DNR,p.l76.</page><page sequence="14">hume's criticism of the design argument 283 eternal revolutions of unguided matter, and may not this account for all the appearing wisdom and contrivance which is in the universe?24 Unlike the position that the world is a living organism, the above is in broad outline an explanatory hypothesis for the fact that the world is an orderly system. But why should this hypothesis be considered as good or better than that of design? Hume introduces it as possibly true. But 'possibly* in what sense? A priori? But in that case Hume's point would have no bearing on the argument from design; since the argument did not consist in a logical deduc tion of a world designer from the fact that the world exhibits order. The possibility, if it is to undermine the design argument, must be grounded like the design argument on experience. The issue turns on the question: Is the Epicurean hypothesis empirically at least as well grounded as that of design? And the answer Hume should have given is that it is not. Unlike design Hume simply did not have a known sample of objects exhibiting order which originated in ac cordance with the Epicurean hypothesis. Perhaps evolutionary theory might have supplied him with just such a sample. But whether this is so or not, Hume, living in the eighteenth century, was in no position to consider it. And since our concern in this paper is whether Hume had undermined the argument from design, the answer respecting his objection under consideration must be no. Concluding Remark Hume, as I have tried to show, failed to undermine the argu ment from design insofar as it involved the inference to (4'). This, however, in no way detracts from the significance of the Dialogues as a masterpiece of natural theology. What Hume did accomplish was to demonstrate that the argument can in no way contribute to the erection of a religious system, and this for two reasons. First, while the inference to design has some strength, it is nevertheless a weak inductive argument and ought not, therefore, to lead to that unqualified conviction in a world creator which is demanded of religious worshippers. Secondly, the only thing we have a right to infer about the nature of the world designer (or designers) is that 24DNR, p. 184.</page><page sequence="15">284 LEON PEARL he has intelligence. And we have absolutely no grounds for saying that he is benevolent or that he created the world ex nihilo. Nor, for that matter, do we have the right to make the inference to (6) and assign degrees to his intelligence and power. That Hume's paramount intention (though not his exclusive one) in the Dialogues was not to undermine the inference to design, but rather to eliminate its use for religious apologetics, can be seen from his last comment about the argument in the Dialogues. If the whole of natural theology, as some people seem to maintain, resolves itself into one simple, though somewhat ambiguous, at least undefined proposition, that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence: If this proposition be not capable of extension, variation, or more particular explication: If it afford no inference that affects human life, or can be the source of any action or forbearance: And if the analogy, imperfect as it is, can be carried no farther than to the human intelligence; and cannot be transferred, with any appear ance of probability, to the other qualities of the mind: If this really be the case, what can the most inquisitive, contemplative, and religious man do more than give a plain, philosophical assent to the proposition, as often as it occurs; and believe that the arguments, on which it is established, exceed the objections which lie against it?25 Leon Pearl Hofstra University 25 DNR, p. 227, Italics in text.</page></plain_text>
