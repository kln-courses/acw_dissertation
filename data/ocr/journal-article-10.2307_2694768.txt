The Smithsonian Institution has re, cently inaugurated a program of foreign-currency support for American institutions of higher learning interested in archaeological excavation or research in the so-called "Public Law 480 excess countries." These are nations in which the United States Government holds amounts of foreign currencies, derived from the sale of surplus 452</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH 453 agricultural commodities, which the Treasury Depart- ment has determined to be excess to the normal require- ments of the United States. Under this program, Ameri- can universities or museums may apply to the Smith- sonian for foreign-currency grants to cover the field costs of archaeological surveys, excavation, or research in the excess-currency countries. At the present time these countries are: Egypt India Israel Ceylon Poland Pakistan Yugoslavia Burma Tunisia Guinea DEFINITION AND SCOPE OF PROGRAM. The Smithsonian defines archaeology as the study of ancient man in its broadest sense. The Institution will therefore consider proposals for a wide variety of projects in archaeology and related fields. Project proposals, for example, might range from paleontological or stratigraphic investigations concerning the origins of man to studies in art history which have bearing on the social or cultural history of ancient civili- zations. Proposals for the study of contemporary peoples may also be considered when these can contribute to greater understanding of man's past. The Smithsonian's initial appropriation for this pro- gram during Fiscal Year 1966 is the equivalent of U.S. $1,300,000 in foreign currencies. The Institution is espe- cially interested in using its grant resources for projects in those excess-currency countries where little or no archaeological investigation has been carried out by American institutions. PROCEDURES FOR SUBMITTING PROPOSALS. Interested in- stitutions may wish to consider the following general guidelines for the preparation of proposals: (1) The Smithsonian cannot consider proposals for work in countries other than those which the Treasury Department has determined to be in the excess category, as listed above. This determination is under constant review; consequently, countries are added to or dropped from the excess list from time to time. Once the Insti- tution awards a foreign-currency grant, however, it is available until expended and not affected by any subse- quent changes in the excess status of a given country. (2) Grants can be made only to American institu- tions, but this does not preclude the possibility of making cooperative arrangements with host-country institutions nor the hiring of foreign nationals. On the contrary, the Smithsonian believes that wherever possible grantee insti- tutions should seek maximum support or cooperation from appropriate host-country organizations, govern- mental or private. (3) The Institution will normally expect that inter- ested American universities or museums will themselves bear the U.S. dollar cost of preliminary explorations abroad or preparatory studies in the United States and that information on these prior expenditures will form part of their proposals. The Smithsonian therefore will not consider proposals aimed at exploring the potential of a given site or carrying out preliminary reconnais- sance of promising areas. Exceptions might be made in the case of countries which are virtually unknown archaeologically, where reconnaissance or preliminary surveys would be the logical first step, or in areas where reconnaissance will produce information on pattern stud- ies, population density, and other such information which cannot be obtained through excavation or study of a single site. (4) The main purpose of the Smithsonian's program is to extend support for field work abroad; that is, to provide local currencies for those expenditures that can most advantageously be met overseas. Typical expendi- ture items might include salaries to associate investi- gators, foremen, draftsmen, or laborers; costs of field equipment and supplies that can best be obtained abroad; construction costs for temporary buildings or shelters; in-country travel; and international travel to and from countries which permit the purchase of air trans- portation in their own currencies, rather than in U.S. dollars. (5) In most cases the Smithsonian will prefer to award annual grants, subject to yearly review and re- newal. Institutions with project proposals which have a clearly predictable termination may, however, submit proposals for two, three, or more years.

C. 20560 SOUTHEASTERN MESOAMERICA Archaeological research in Southeastern Mesoamerica during 1965 has been varied and productive largely though routine. As part of long-range programs, exten- sive excavations were carried out by the Peabody Mu- seum at Seibal, by the University of Pennsylvania Mu- seum at Tikal, by the Royal Ontario Museum at Altun Ha in British Honduras, and by the Brigham Young Uni- versity-New World Archaeological Foundation in Chia- pas, Mexico. Individual projects were undertaken at Lake Izabal and in the Guatemalan Highlands, and some final site-mapping augmented the laboratory and writing phases of work by Tulane University at Dzibilchaltun. PACIFIC COAST. No new work was begun in coastal Guatemala, but the Bilbao report being prepared by Stephan F. de Borhegyi and Lee A. Parsons is planned for publication by the Milwaukee Public Museum during the 1966-67 winter. Parsons plans work at Monte Alto in the hope that this Middle and Late Preclassic site will permit a delineation of early developments in ceramics and sculpture not obtained at Bilbao, where the dominat- ing Middle and Late Classic building activities had greatly disturbed the earlier occupational debris,</page><page sequence="3">454 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 3, 1966 Michael Coe and Kent Flannery report that their Salinas La Blanca publication is in press at the Smith- sonian. The correctness of their placement of the Early Preclassic Cuadros and Jocotal phases between the La Victoria Ocos and Conchas I phases has been demon- strated by independent research at nearby Chiapas sites (see below). Supported by the BYU-New World Archaeological Foundation, Carlos Navarrete of the Mexican National Museum of Anthropology terminated the field phase of his Soconusco (southeast coastal plain in Chiapas) re- connaissance during the winter of 1965. Mapping of dis- covered sites is being continued by his associate investi- gator, Eduardo Martinez, BYU-NWAF topographer. An outstanding contribution has been the test-pitting of heavy sherd deposits on a group of tiny islands in the mangrove swamps near Mapastepec which relate almost exclusively to the Early Preclassic Ocos phase of La Victoria. Shells are rare and a fishing economy is indi- cated, perhaps based on shrimp-taking then as now. This Islona area and its early occupation is adjacent to and related to the Chantuto shell-midden area previously investigated successively (and very briefly) by both Philip Drucker and Jose' Luis Lorenzo. The truly early nature of this lagoon occupation (also found in the Chiapas section of the Suchiate delta) strengthens the possibility of preceramic cultures existing here, as suggested by Drucker. But the Ocos ceramic complexes known on the Pacific coast still seem the result of diffusion rather than of local development. Other patterns made appar- ent by the Navarrete-Martinez survey are those of the confinement of major Late Preclassic ceremonial centers to the better-drained foothill and elevated river margins and the prevalence of small Late Postclassic sites close to the coastal lagoons. Study of the Soconusco pottery con- tinues. Additional trenching by Gareth W. Lowe at the coastal plain site of Altamira near Mazatan produced ample though shallow evidence of an Ocos-like occupation at that site, as well as confirmation of the Ocos-Cuadros- Jocotal-Conchas 1 sequence. This sequence was deduced but not actually found in reliable proximity by Coe and Flannery in the Guatemalan sector of the Soconusco. A Cuadros-Jocotal figurine complex was also found at Alta- mira, although unknown from the type sites. A report on the Altamira investigations by Dee F. Green and Lowe is now in press. The fourth and final season at Tzapa, near Tapachula on the Mexico Guatemala frontier, was completed by the BYU-NWAF in June. The excavations, under the general supervision of Lowe as field director, were ex- tended into the rainy season in order to investigate more fully Preclassic refuse encountered late in the season. Undisturbed deposits, so far unique for this period at Izapa, were found in two places. The earlier (Mamom- like) deposit is beneath the low Mound 9 terrace at a depth of over 3 m. The slightly later and much larger deposit is east of the Group A plaza, at shallower 1- to 2.5-m. depths, beneath a level area between Mounds 57 and 59. The refuse contains much partially restorable pottery, including incense burners of the "inner loop- handle" type. Susanna Ekholm, after terminating excava- :ions begun in the latter area by Pierre Agrinier, has andertaken the classification and description of the Izapa Preclassic pottery and artifacts for publication. This project has already demonstrated the close similarity of the Izapa Early Preclassic pottery (from Mound 30 fill) Lo that of La Victoria and Salinas La Blanca nearby in Guatemala. A general similarity of late Middle Pre- classic types to those of Mamom and other approximately contemporary complexes of the Lowland Maya area is also apparent, with a more regional and unique speciali- zation of Tzapa noted during the Late Preclassic. In the latter period, everted rims and modeling are emphasized to an unusual degree; for example, fish effigy rims are rather common. A figurine complex is also present, dramatizing the departure from the partly contemporary Chicanel norm of the Lowland Maya tradition at this time. Relationships seem strongest with the uppermost valley of the Grijalva River (the Chapatengo-Chejel subregion). Surprising features of both the Mound 9 and Mound 59 Preclassic refuse areas were small stone-covered drains, not previously known at Izapa. In the mound 59 area, drains seem to have served as entry and overflow for an adjacent reservoir. The slightly sloping facing of this reservoir is over 4 m. high, and it is paved with great flat-surfaced boulders. The area is at the western base of Mound 60, largest structure at Izapa. Another stone-lined drain was the salient feature of a much later house mound (Mound 152) excavated by Thomas A. Lee, Jr., in Group F on the northern periphery of Izapa. Here the shallow drain is of Late Classic date and of uncertain function, since it departed from be- neath the floor level of the inner room of the supposed dwelling and was traced to a meaningless termination 16 m. distant. Other features of interest here were an apparent "porch" on the eastern and southern sides of the structure (all known by stone-foundation lines only) and numerous clay spindle whorls among the very abundant sherds. San Juan Plumbate is the dominant pottery. Other trenched low mounds flanking the Group F ceremonial center produced central pottery caches or urn burials. The outstanding object recovered from the Group F caches (Cache 107 in Mound 114) was a thin, oval gold medallion. Twin intertwined plumed serpents done in repousse technique suggest that the object pertained to the Quetzalcoatl cult. Associated San Juan (ferruginous) Plumbate pottery indicates a Late Classic date, but the effigy forms may be transitional to the Postclassic period. Frontal trenching to bedrock of the principal Group F pyramid (Mound 125a) uncovered a continuous series of caches and urn burials dating from Late Classic back to early Early Classic or Late Protoclassic. Two recent radiocarbon dates from similar caches and floor levels 4 m. below surface in the approximate center of the mound core are A.D. 100 and 150, suggesting that the</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH 455 original construction of Group F had begun during the Protoclassic. Ceramics in this period, somewhat Central American in appearance, are eventually tied down in time by the appearance of early Tzakol Maya polychrome vessels in caches of succeeding stages of construction. The long and well-documented Protoclassic through Early Postclassic portion of the Izapa ceramic history is being described by Carole Potter, whose publication is expected to appear during the coming year. The large number of restorable vessels and their frequently unique shapes and incised and modeled decoration lend unusual interest to this report. This report will include the first extensive inventory of San Juan Plumbate pottery. Architectural investigations by Lowe and Martinez in the Mound 30 platform-and-pyramid complex established the pattern of horizontal accretion responsible for the final form of these structures. Small refuse accumula- tions and a few caches permit dating of successive addi- tions, the bulk of which pertain to the late Middle and Late Preclassic periods. Protoclassic and Early Classic construction is extremely superficial but nevertheless contemporary with the present position of all sculpture gracing the platform (four carved stelae and four altars) and its frontal plaza (three pillars-with-balls and one four-legged carved throne). Identification of the highly regional pottery types characterizing the terminal occupation of the central groups as Tzakol contemporaries tends to update Izapa stone sculpture. Only Monument 2 is still in an un- equivocal Preclassic setting. This monument, which rep- resents an open serpent-mouth holding a seated person- age in offertory attitude, is north of and to the rear of the Mound 30 ceremonial plaza; apparently it was so heavy and so deeply carved that it made movement to a new setting too risky an operation. While stylistic crossties with early Kaminaljuyui monuments and sculp- turally depicted early incense burners (with inner-loop supports) rather firmly establish a late Preclassic date for the carving of many of the Izapa sculptures, others may well have been carved as late as the Early Classic. CENTRAL CHIAPAS. Additional excavations at Mirador, an upper Rio La Venta site in the Municipio of Jiqui- pilas, were directed by Agrinier for the BYU-NWAF. Tunneling of pyramidal Mound 20 verified the Middle Preclassic date of the clay interior structure, which is overlaid by early Late Preclassic and Middle Classic con, structions. The riddle of Mound 20 is the absence of activity assignable to the end of the Late Preclassic and to the Protoclassic, since debris from these periods is abundant in adjacent fields and arroyos. A massive clearing of one such refuse area indicates a deliberate filling-and-leveling operation, suggesting the possibility that contemporary material may have been stripped from Mound 20 in order to create flatter living space. An exceptionally large inventory of the typical Mirador Late Preclassic figurines, censers, and pottery reported earlier by Frederick Peterson has been accumulated this season, but unfortunately good stratigraphy for this intensive period of occupation is still lacking. Much more satisfactory data have been acquired for both the Middle Preclassic and the Middle Classic periods at Mirador. The eastern wing of Mound 27 was sectioned and this work revealed a clay-surfaced terraced platform with a wide southern stairway. Burials and fill material clearly show the Escalera (Chiapa III) affinities of this structure. It covers occupational debris of the Dili (Chiapa II) phase. More complete excavation of this important complex is proceeding. Contemporary con- struction has been found within a number of other mounds at Mirador (in addition to Mound 20). The evi- dence indicates that the Middle Preclassic period saw the introduction of platform and pyramid construction throughout Chiapas, and indeed throughout the Lowland Maya area as well, for a very similar pattern at this "Early Mamom" time level is apparent at both Chiapa de Corzo and Izapa and is now appearing at Seibal (see below). Middle Classic burials accompanied by handsome offering vessels in Teotihuacanoid and local styles have been frequent finds in deep trenches dug into Mounds 9 and 10. Other exceptional finds have been bone ear- plugs carved with Maya figures and the stucco remains of what may have been a codex. Now only a small but finely layered mass of lime beyond hope of salvation, this is one of the rare archaeological discoveries of a pre-Hispanic probable codex. Test trenches at Miramar, a more formally structured companion site to Mirador on the left bank of the Rio La Venta, show a generally comparable occupation be- ginning with the Middle Preclassic (Dili phase), but with a probable climax in the Late Classic at a time when Mirador was largely abandoned. But Miramar, like Mirador, does have a pronounced Teotihuacanoid occu- pation, a circumstance which sets these sites well into the Teotihuacan sphere of influence (or dominion?) in contradistinction to Chiapa de Corzo and the Grijalva River region generally, where the influence was barely notable. As part of a planned project to round out the BYU- NWAF investigations at Chiapa de Corzo, Tim F. Tucker excavated the badly looted and partially destroyed Mound 3 on the edge of the plateau west of the Mound 1 plaza. A consecutive series of Late and Early Proto- classic platforms and walled room complexes is now be- ing uncovered. Abundant refuse and occasional caches may indicate functions. Underlying Preclassic structures are to be completely cleared if time permits during the late summer and fall months of 1965. In a joint effort with the Instituto Nacional de Antro- pologia e Historia, the BYU-NWAF is making an archaeo- logical survey of those portions of the Grijalva and La Venta river basins to be flooded by the Nezahualcoyotl Dam at Mal Paso (Raudales), Chiapas. Salvage opera- tions will be undertaken at as many sites as possible prior to the flooding of the basins, scheduled to begin in May, 1966. One major site of Early and Late Classic date with massive stone-faced buildings and carved stone monuments has already been found at the Finca San</page><page sequence="5">456 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 3, 1966 Isidro. A number of smaller sites have been identified by preliminary reconnaissance. The colonial town of Que- chula will also be flooded. An attempt will be made to determine if this or some other locality is the actual site of the pre-Hispanic Zoque community visited by the Conquistadores in 1524, as related by Bernal Diaz del Castillo. HIGHLAND GUATEMALA. Both actual and projected sal- vage operations at the terribly ravaged but all-important early highland Maya site of Kaminaljuyu' received an unfortunate setback with the illness of S. W. Miles early last winter. The only encouraging development is the news that Ing. Don Gustavo Espinosa has readied a manuscript reporting his years of tunneling and clearing within the massive D-II ball-court complex. Support for responsible investigation at Kaminaljuyu' is badly needed. Robert Wauchope has completed a manuscript re- porting his field work done many years ago at Utatlan. As a continuation of the comparative research for this report, Wauchope is now making a general study of Pro- tohistoric pottery in highland Guatemala. Museum re- search on such types as Fortress White-on-red and Chinautla Polychrome is providing interesting insights into the contact period occupation. A two year project of archaeological research in north- ern El Quiche was directed in 1964-65 by Pierre Bequelin. The project was sponsored by the National Scientific Research Center of France, with a grant-in-aid from the Wenner-Gren Foundation. During the first field season, about 30 mi. of the upper valley of the Xacbal River were surveyed from Nebaj to Ilom. Eighteen new sites were studied and mapped. Two new groups of ruins were discovered in the Nebaj Valley, near the site of Nebaj. Stratigraphic excavations were made at two Postclassic sites in the Ilom region. The sites of the upper Xacbal Valley are similar to those surveyed by A. L. Smith (1955) in the Cotzal Valley east of Nebaj. Small cere- monial centers were rather evenly distributed throughout the whole region during Classic and Postclassic times. The site of Nebaj is exceptional in that it was the only major ceremonial center during the Classic period. During the second field season, excavations were undertaken in the Acul locality, about 5 mi. west of Nebaj, where four sites had been surveyed previously. The main objective was to excavate a ball court of the "open-end A" type, common to many sites of the region. Three sites on the valley floor were excavated from December, 1964, to April, 1965. This work produced a chronological sequence of three phases: Acul I, II, and III (corresponding respectively to the Late Classic, Early Postclassic, and Late Postclassic periods). The most im- portant of these sites was a ceremonial center with an occupation lasting throughout the three phases. The ball court was probably constructed late in the Acul I phase. The characteristics of the phases are summarized as follows: Acul I: founding of two ceremonial centers in the valley; construction of altars in the centers of "plazas"; extended primary burials; secondary urn burials; per- sistence of ceramic traits inherited from the Early Classic (such as basal-flanged ring-stand bowls); high percentage of monochrome pottery within mortuary offerings (more than 70%); complete lack of Peten-like polychromes; numerous ceramic types common to Nebaj. Acul II: persistence of urn burials at the beginning of the phase, most of the burials primary, in sitting posi- tion; imported Tohil Plumbate pottery; first occurrence of tripod vessels with molded zoomorphic supports; im- ported copper artifacts; continued occupation of the ceremonial centers. Acul III: abandonment of one of the sites and found- ing of a new center in a potentially defensive position; burials with mutilations (most frequently decapitation) and without offerings; highest percentage of monochrome pottery (more than 90%); small quantities of imported Fortress White&amp;on-red ceramics; first occurrence of ladle censers with tubular handles ending in mold-decorated anthropomorphic heads. In short, it may be stated that the small ceremonial centers of the Acul Valley can be classified as "marginal Classic" from a developmental point of view, as is the case for a considerable number of sites in the Guatemalan Highlands during the Classic period. In Postclassic times, occupation persisted with only slight changes. Richard E. W. Adams and Kent Day from the Uni- versity of Minnesota worked on a ceramic chronology project in northern Quiche and Alta Verapaz from April through July, 1965, under a National Science Foundation grant. The first two months were spent in the field and the last two at the National Museum in Guatemala City. Surface collections were made from all groups at Nebaj, and one test pit was dug in the plaza between Groups A and B. However, partly due to landowner opposition, further work was discontinued. Operations were begun in April on the large Finca San Francisco in the Cotzal Valley to the east of Nebaj. Most of the field season was spent here. Four sites near the junction of the Chipal and Cotzal rivers were tested. The sites were Tzicuay, San Francisco, San Francisco del Norte, and Palo Viejo. The first three sites had been mapped and surveyed previously by A. L. Smith, but the last site is a new one. Thirty-three test pits in these sites yielded a ceramic sequence based on strati- graphic evidence. In addition, some 60 whole vessels, figurines of distinctive forms, potsherds, and miscellane- ous objects were studied at Finca San Francisco, where they had been stored for nearly 20 years. This material had been discovered by Smith in a tomb at Tzicuay during his survey of 1946, and circumstances had never permitted its study. Together with nine other vessels from the same tomb brought back to the National Museum by Smith, these vessels gave the investigators a valuable headstart in typological description and in ascertaining the time range of ceramics in the Cotzal area. Work at the Finca San Francisco sites was termi- nated in late May, and the whole vessels, together with some 1700 lbs. of sherds, were sent to Guatemala</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEARCH 457 City. A reconnaissance trip was made in early June to the Coban area where two new sites were found. Both yielded enormous amounts of pottery on the sur- face, and one (on Finca Chajcar) consists of agricultural terraces associated with what appear to be domestic house platforms. Analysis of the material from the Tzicuay tomb and from the stratigraphic pits yielded an uninterrupted se- quence running from Protoclassic through the Proto- historic periods. Type-variety description of types has been completed and all material completely recorded. Stratigraphic evidence from the pits has permitted the grouping of types into complexes and, in turn, placing the complexes in a sequence. The earliest complex is Protoclassic and includes mammiform tetrapods, two, handled jars of a distinctive form, censers with "cog- wheel" teeth at rim and base, Peten-style basal-flange polychrome bowls, and many special forms, including one bridged-spout polychrome jar similar to a Holmul 1 example. Contacts with the adjacent regions of the highlands as well as with the Peten are apparent. During the succeeding ceramic phases, however, there is a strik- ing lack of wide contacts and a tendency toward isola- tionism in ceramic ideas. The late part of the Early Classic is represented by continuities with the Proto- classic complex, but such innovations as a specific resist technique and "duck-pot" censer lids set it apart. The next complex is a long-lived one which has been sub- phased into three parts. The Early part is approximately equivalent to Late Classic 1 and 2 times of the Peten, the Middle about equivalent to Late Classic 3 times, and the Late represents the Early Postclassic and includes the time of Plumbate trade. All parts of the complex are tied together with strong continuities in the red and red-brown utility types. Likewise, comal forms tie the complex together, although there are subtle changes in modes through time. Protohistoric pottery represents a continuum, but with innovations in the statistically domi- nant red and red-brown utility types. In addition, such new features as ladle censers and mold-made bowls appear. Some data on land use and settlement pattern were obtained. The river-junction region is one of very steep ridges with little flat bottomland. However, the soil is fertile, and moisture is abundant all year round, with cloudy weather predominating. Soil depths vary from 5 to 15 cm., with a good sandy base to give adequate drainage. In short, the region is ideal for swidden agri- culture of a highland nature. Today houses are built on ledges or terraces cut from the hillsides. Similar stone- faced ancient terraces were found in association with refuse indicating domestic origin. This refuse includes potsherds, metate fragments, and obsidian flakes, indi- cating that the pattern of today is a perpetuation of the archaeological past. Most of the test pits were dug in such domestic living areas. It seems probable that the same settlement pattern has obtained since the first settlement of the valley, because most of the ceramic sequence is intimately associated with house terraces. These ancient terraces are dispersed in much the same manner as those of the present and probably for the same reason: the practice of swidden agriculture, which requires rotation of fields. The ceremonial centers of the Cotzal-Chipal junction region consist of ball courts with associated mounds. The presence of tombs in at least four of these associated structures, the smallness of the centers, and other evi- dence suggest that the primary function of the cere- monial centers was as burial places for the distinguished dead. No evidence was found of elaborate residential structures similar to the Peten palaces. The ball game of the Classic period in the Maya area is not well under- stood. From conquest-period accounts it is known that the game had both recreational and ceremonial aspects in Mexico. That the game among the Maya (in both highlands and lowlands) was similar in play seems fairly certain. What the function was is not certain. The con- stant association of ball courts with structures which apparently served a strictly memorial purpose seems to imply some connection between the game and the burial mounds. No Preclassic material was found during excavation. No anomalous sherds imply a Preclassic occupation. Although it may be revealed by future work, the absence of a Postclassic occupation in the lower Cotzal Valley must be assumed for the present. One more season will be spent in an attempt to elucidate and expand the sequence. To this end it is planned to excavate again at Tzicuay and at another previously unreported site farther up the Cotzal Valley. Testing at Nebaj will be followed by a shift to the Alta Verapaz region, where tests will be made at two new sites near Coban, as well as at Chama on the Chixoy River. It is hoped that this work will provide a sequence for Alta Verapaz and throw more light on highland-lowland relationships. The Cotzal Valley and even the Nebaj locality seem not to have been transmission regions be- tween the highlands and the lowlands. It is possible that pertinent data may be found at sites along the Chama-Coban-Chajcar line. LOWLAND MAYA. According to E. Willys Andrews, field work at Dzibilchaltun was completed in 1964, but additional mapping of this very extensive site was com- pleted by Ed Juriack as a terminal part of the Tulane University project during 1965. Robert Wauchope reports that the Dzibilchaltun site map is being published as a series of separate sheets, the first 22 of which are being issued as preprints in the near future. A second progress report is in press. Efforts are now being concentrated on completion of the Dzibilchaltun field report and the Balankanche Cave publication. According to a report submitted by A. H. Anderson, British Honduras has become self?governing. The new government is not only taking steps to enforce the laws aimed at protecting the many ancient Maya remains in this country from wanton damage but is also endeavor- ing to encourage archaeologists from abroad to carry out scientific exploration and development of the sites. Dig-</page><page sequence="7">458 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 3, 1966 ging in or removing antiquities from ancient ruins, except under government permit, has been prohibited since 1925, but now an applicant for a permit must satisfy the government that he is a genuine archaeologist -not a pot hunter masquerading as an archaeologist - and that the intent of his proposed operation is truly scien- tific. The export of antiquities from this country has been prohibited except under permit since 1925. How- ever, the government is highly cooperative in its dealings with holders of archaeological permits. For example, a permit holder is allowed to retain - and is given a permit to export - up to 50% of his portable artifact finds, the division being made by alternate choice by the permit holder and a government representative. This generous allowance means, on the basis of the prices usually paid by museums when purchasing exhibits, that it is possible for a museum carrying out a project under permit to recover in value the equivalent of a large part of the money spent on the project. In addition, there is the publicity and status value of its report on the scientific gains. The government does much to facilitate the work of permit holders, and institutions with long- term or large-scale projects are usually given the privi- lege of importing their equipment and supplies free of customs duties. Archaeology comes under the Minister of Natural Resources and Trade, Paslow Building, Belize City, British Honduras. Archaeologists seeking informa- tion on permit conditions or purely technical matters should write to the Archaeological Commissioner, De- partment of Archaeology, Belize City, British Honduras, but actual applications for archaeological permits should be addressed to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Trade. The Archaeological Commissioner (A. H. Anderson) was absent from the country for six months of 1964 on preretiral (age limit) leave. He retired on pension at the end of 1964 but was immediately re-engaged by the government on contract. His successor will eventually be a local student whose training is to be financed through a university scholarship in anthropology. British Honduras is struggling with the crippling finan- cial problems that plague small countries. Major sub- surface exploration by the Archaeological Commissioner during the past few years has been prevented by lack of funds. His efforts and funds are still being largely concentrated on developing Xunantunich, Cayo District, into a tourist attraction as part of the government's drive to foster the budding tourist trade. Naturally, in the course of this work he brings to light parts of construc- tion works which might yield more data of archaeological interest if funds were available for full excavation. One interesting discovery is a vaulted masonry drain built to carry off water from a sunken court in a high platform, the second down in a series extending from near the top of the west face of the main substructure of the tallest pyramid (A-6, 127 ft. from plaza to top) down the steep west face of the high ridge on which the ceremonial center is situated. From the exit lip of the drain to the next platform down is 5.5 m., and downward from the lip a mosaic of large flat stones had been built to form a spillway to prevent erosion of the platform face. Judg- ing by what has been revealed to date, the masonry work adjacent to the drain is very complex and appears to have some peculiar features. Much of British Honduras is limestone, and in the hilly areas caves are common. Most of these contain pots and sherds and some have masonry partition walls, platforms, and other ancient Maya works. At least one has indications of actual occupation, while in others the amount of work done to level the floors suggests more than casual use. One such modified cave (Cubeta) has a series of benches, 1 m. high and 1 m. wide, built up a steep slope under a high ceiling; under roof fall and other debris there appear to be the remains of a roughly made stairway down one end of the benches. Another (Actun Balam) had a well-made stairway of slate slabs leading down from the mouth to a passage with a fine stucco floor. Las Cuevas, four linked caves with a total length of 1500 ft., has remains of masonry walls and doorways at the openings into each other and a walled- off grotto. When found, the outer cave (approximately 500 ft. long by 200 ft. wide and with an average height of 60 ft.) contained many well-made, stucco-floored plat- forms on one of which postholes were found. Unfortunately, during the past few years the ancient Maya antiquities in this country have attracted from abroad, chiefly the United States, increasing numbers of commercial pot hunters and persons commissioned by them. They not only raid the sites themselves but they also bribe local men to do so. The platforms in Las Cuevas, the slate stairway and stucco floor of Actun Balam, and other ancient works in caves and surface sites have been ripped up and destroyed. The destruc- tion has become so serious that new protection laws are being drafted in which the penalties will be greatly in- creased; it is being advocated that the new penalties should include imprisonment without the option of a fine for illegal digging in a site and for inciting a persort to commit such a breach of the law. The second year of operations at Altun Ha by the Royal -Ontario Museum under David M. Pendergast as field director was completed in 1965. The finds were, if possible, more spectacular than those made in 1964. Six more major tombs were excavated, and these yielded quantities of carved and plain jades, carved shell orna- ments, shell beads, giant eccentric flints, obsidian and flint blades in a wide variety of sizes, and pottery in effigy shapes. In addition to these relatively late ma- terials, other deposits have been tested which demon- strate occupation during the Late Preclassic, Protoclassic, and Early Classic periods. The new information from Altun Ha is throwing much valuable light on the social, religious, and commercial activities of the ancient Maya. One thing is now clear - Altun Ha in its heyday was of major importance and the focal point of a very large area. Continuing the Yale University project reported previ- ously, Barbara Denton returned to the Lake Izabal area</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH 459 in June, 1965. In addition to her reconnaissance of the zone, she planned to excavaate one or more sites, includ- ing the large Protoclassic site on the peninsula occupied by the Castillo San Felipe. This information was sub- mitted by Michael Coe, who plans to start a three-year project at the major Olmec site of San Lorenzo in south- ern Veracruz in December. According to a report submitted by A. Ledyard Smith, the second of four field seasons planned for the Seibal project in Guatemala was begun by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University in February, 1965, and continued until May. A description of the ruins of Seibal and the history of the site, as well as a summary of the work carried on during the first field season, appeared in the January issue of this journal. The staff consisted of Gordon R. Willey, director; A. Ledyard Smith, field director; three graduate students, G. Tourtellot, J. Sab- loff, and E. W. Andrews; Ian Graham from England; and Jose Antonio Oliveras from Guatemala. Tourtellot assisted Graham in completing a map of the three main groups and began a preliminary survey beyond the limits of this central area. Sabloff, under the direction of Willey, took over the study of pottery and other arti- facts. Willey also analyzed the stucco remains from Structure A-3. Oliveras, an artist, made drawings of selected pieces of this stucco decoration. Smith and Andrews carried on excavations in groups A, C, and D. Work was concentrated in Group A, but other activity included six exploratory pits in Group D, the partial excavation of Structure C-9, a ball court in Group C, and minor excavations in a house mound outside the three main ceremonial groups. Four Group A structures, all dating from the latter part of the Late Classic period, were investigated: a small temple mound, Structure A-3; a ceremonial platform, Structure A-13, a "palace" type building, Structure A-14; and a ball court, Structure A-19. Sixteen test pits were dug, and five carved and two plain stelae were investigated for possible substela caches. The mapping of the ceremonial part of the site was completed, and work on the structures lying out- side this area was begun. Laboratory studies of the pot- tery and artifacts recovered from the excavations in structures and exploratory pits were kept up-to-date as much as possible, which was a great help to those in charge of the digging. By the end of the season, eight burials and seven caches had been excavated. Except for one burial that was associated with Middle Preclassic sherds, all burials date from the latter part of the Late Classic period. One of these, Burial 1 from Structure A-14, contained the skeleton of a young adult female and six pottery vessels from the Boca phase. Among these vessels was a mod- eled-carved, Fine Orange, barrel-shaped vase with ring- stand base. Of the seven caches, four were under stelae, one was from Structure A-14, and two were from pits in the central plaza of Group A. The two latter are from the Middle Preclassic period. One of these, Cache 7, consisted of five flaring-rim, collared water jars, six greenstone celts, and one lancetlike greenstone object with rectangular base and sharp point that may have been used in ceremonial blood-letting. The objects of Cache 7 were placed in a cruciform arrangement. The other five caches were from the latter part of the Late Classic period. Three of these were rough jade boulders, two below stelae and one from Structure A-14. The boulders (five were recovered, three from a single sub- stela cache) have weights that range from 6 to 19 lbs. One had been cut halfway through. During the excava- tion of Structure A-3, Stela 21, which bears a date of 10.1.0.0.0, was found in the central room. Another carved stela, Stela 20 with a date of 10.3.0.0.0., was dis- covered at the base of Structure 24, a high temple mound on the west side of the South Plaza of Group A. A major project of the 1965 field season was the com- plete excavation of Structure A-3, which is in the center of the South Plaza, Group A. This temple is the best- known building at Seibal and is associated with four great stelae discovered in the last century. All carry the date 10.1.0.0.0 (A.D. 849) and three, Stelae 9, 10, and 11, had altars in front of them. Structure A-3 is a small building with a pyramidal substructure, its top 4 m. above plaza level, and a masonry superstructure. At its base the substructure measures slightly over 17 m. on a side. It rises in three terraces with vertical walls to a square platform upon which the superstructure rests. Four projecting stairways, centrally placed on each side, lead from the plaza to the top of the third terrace. A single step in line with each of these stairways gives access to the platform. The superstructure has three parallel rooms with two interior doorways. Four door- ways lead into the temple. The walls of the building bear a veneer of nicely cut and faced stones laid against a hearting of mortar and stone. The outside of Structure A-3, both substructure and superstructure, was plastered and painted red. Only in a few places was red coloring found inside the rooms. The upper zone of the temple building had once carried an elaborate stucco frieze which probably extended above the roof line in certain places, such as over the doorways. Although no stucco decoration was found in place, the recovery of thousands of fragments, which had slid down the stairways and terraces of the supporting platform when the vaults of the temple had collapsed, was the outstanding feature of the Structure A-3 excavation. The fragments show that the figures composing the frieze had been constructed by modeling plaster around prepared stone armatures. Heads, bodies, arms, and legs of these full-round and high-relief human and animal figures were among the fragments. These still bore traces of brilliant red, blue, green, yellow, and black pigments. They indicate that the temple must have presented a most colorful and spectacular appearance. The figures include humans, gods or demons, monkeys, jaguars, pigs, and other animals. Many decorative elements from the costumes of the figures were found, as well as a number of stucco glyphs. Among the latter was a Period Ending date, 7 Ahau, 18 Zip(?), which would fall in 10.0.0.0.0 or A.D. 830. This is roughly 20 years earlier than the</page><page sequence="9">460 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 3, 1966 five stelae associated with Structure A-3 and indicates that the temple was constructed before the stelae were erected. Excavation under Stela 21 in the central room produced Cache 1 with the three jade boulders. This stela had a plain altar. Signs of burning were on the floor in front of the altar and in other parts of the rooms, especially in front of the doorways. Excavation in three sides of the substructure and through the floors of the rooms failed to produce a tomb or burial but did uncover a rough inner structure made of unworked rocks, with a stairway on its east side. From the top of each terrace a leveling surface of crushed marl and small stones extended through the structure. On the upper two of these building levels were found nicely worked stones set on end with a burnt area in front. This indicates that ceremonies were carried on periodically during erection of the substructure. The purpose of this inner construction was to retain the loose stone fill of the substructure and to act as a reinforce- ment for the outer building. Structure A-13, a small platform in the center of the Central Plaza in Group A, is roughly in line with the long axis of Structure A-19, a ball court. This platform has a small projecting stairway on each of its four sides. Excavations uncovered Burial 4, which includes the re- mains of at least 11 skeletons in an area 3.4 by .8 m. The remains all appear to be of secondary interments or else the bodies had been dismembered before burial. In the case of one skeleton only was there any semblance of the bones being articulated or in place; the remainder were scattered and mixed, and many had been burned. No furniture of any sort was found. This burial suggests human sacrifice at Seibal. The palacelike structure in Group A, Structure A-14, is on the east side of the Central Plaza. The substruc- ture is about 80 m. long and 29 m. wide at its base and rises in five terraces on the west side to a height of 5.35 m. above the plaza. A stairway 39 m. long and centered on the building projects from the west side. The risers of the four bottom steps are considerably higher than the rest, and the treads average about 1 m. in depth, form- ing what might be considered low terraces. In the center and at the north and south ends of the three lowest of these terraces (and possibly the fourth) there once were (some are still in place) hieroglyphic panels. There are enough panels to account for positions on the three lowest terraces. Approximately half of these had been published previous to this year; the remainder were uncovered during the 1965 season. The date on these panels has been read as 9.16.0.0.0 (A.D. 751), the earliest date so far found at Seibal. On top of the substructure is a long, low platform which supports two structures, A-14a to the north and A-14b to the south. Neither was vaulted. The area between these two buildings may have been used for ceremonies, for under its floor were found Cache 2 and Burial 1. Cache 2 was a single jade boulder centrally placed 65 cm. below the floor. The ball court in Group A, Structure A-19, is on the west side of the Central Plaza, its long axis lying close to east-west. The north range stands free, but the south range is built onto the north side of Structure A-20, a large pyramid. The alley between the ranges is 39 m. long and 12 m. wide, and the ranges are about 3 m. above the alley floor. No steps were found leading up to the top of the north range; however, its back on the north side had three terraces about 80 cm. high and a top terrace of about 40 cm., up which people could have climbed easily. The only structure (C-9) excavated in Group C was a ball court. It is south of the Group C Plaza and west of Causeway II, the west side of the causeway acting as the east end of the east end zone. The long axis is slightly off east-west. The alley is considerably smaller than that of Group A, but the ranges are about 3.5 m. high and have steps on the back which extended their whole length and gave access to the top. Pottery analysis was done concurrently with excava- tion at Seibal and was kept up-to-date as much as possi- ble. Pottery is being classified according to the Type- variety system. The cultural history of Seibal which has emerged so far is based mainly on excavations in Group A. However, excavations in both Groups C and D seem to indicate that the preliminary sequence for Group A can be applied to the rest of the site. An important aspect of the ceramic picture at Seibal was the discovery of an early pottery horizon that dates back to the Middle Preclassic period. This early pottery complex predates the well-known Mamom phase and relates to the Xe complex found at Altar de Sacrificios. The fact that deep Xe-like deposits are found at widespread intervals through Group A, often under sealed floors, points to a fairly heavy early Middle Preclassic occupation of this group. Many of the lowest floors discovered in Group A test pits may be early Middle Preclassic platforms or possibly even portions of a plaza floor. To sum up the past season's ceramic data, there were two important ceramic peaks at Seibal. The first, and certainly the longest, occurred in the Middle Preclassic period, while the second, and probably the most exten- sive, occurred in late Late Classic times. All other periods were weaker, especially the whole Early Classic and early Late Classic. Knowledge of the early Middle Preclassic has increased with every test pit dug, and the chances are good for obtaining much more new informa- tion. Tests undertaken near the close of the season in Group D suggest that more knowledge of a Tepeu 2-like phase at Seibal, as well as other Seibal phases, may be forthcoming next season. William R. Coe reports that the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania continued investiga- tions at Tikal throughout 1965. Much remains to be done before the eleven-year research program of the Tikal Project is concluded in 1966. The tempo and scope of work in and about Tikal has been significantly increased through generous financial aid contributed this year by the Government of Guatemala. While the larger portion of these new funds has been spent on archi- tectural solidification, archaeological investigation has also</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT RESEARCH 461 benefited. A similar contribution is expected in 1966. According to a new contract, government funds will permit the University Museum to follow up its research program at Tikal with a large-scale program of solidifica- tion and reconstruction of buildings and other features uncovered prior to 1967. This new program will be under the direction of Alfred Kidder II. William R. Coe, present director of the Project, will concentrate on the preparation and editing of some 40 volumes that will present the results of work from 1956 through 1966. About 15 individuals are now engaged in writing these Tikal Reports. The 1965 program covers the following operations: North Acropolis, continued excavation (by W. R. Coe, field director George Guillemin, Stanley Loten, and Nicolas Hellmuth); East Plaza, continued excavation (Christopher Jones); Central Acropolis, continued exca- vation (assistant field director Peter Harrison, Miguel Orrego, and Amilcar Ordonez); Temple II, terminal ex- cavation and recording (Guillemin and Carlos Larios); Structure 5C-54, renewed excavation (Jones and Orrego); Stela 23 Groups, renewed excavation (William Havi- land and Ismael Tercero); architectural survey, continua- tion of (Temple IV and Central Acropolis by Wilbur Pearson, Plaza of the Seven Temples by Andrew Nagy; Temple of the Inscriptions by Gordon Echols and Linton Satterthwaite); chultuns, continued investigation (Dennis Puleston); sustaining area investigation (Puleston, Frank Bowles and Jones); and laboratory study (ceramics by Patrick Culbert, artifacts and figurines by Virginia Greene, censers by Lisa Ferree, human skeletal material by William Haviland, and recording by, among others, Karen Mohr, Judith Anderson, and Martha Schiek). The East Plaza excavations consisted of two parts that involved separate problems. The first was a rein- vestigation of the large square platform just east of the plaza, termed Platform 5E-1. The second was an investi- gation of structures bordering and occupying the plaza. Platform 5E-i was first excavated in 1964. As previ- ously reported in this section (January, 1965), it had been concluded that this was an unfinished project intended as an acropolis or great temple which had been started in Late Classic times but never finished. However, not a single Late Classic sherd was recovered from excavations above this huge platform. Thus this platform might be the product of a badly robbed major construction of Early Classic date. To clarify matters, the southwestern basal corner of the platform was cleared in 1965. The earliest construction found here was the lowest terrace of a masonry feature, possibly a temple or an "acropolis" platform. Traces of a large mask were uncovered here, flanked by a terrace with an apron molding and an inset corner. The dating of this structure is not yet known because the associated sherds still await study; masonry will also aid in dating. An Early Classic construction date is anticipated. It can now be stated with assurance that a very large construction, probably the entire platform, existed here long before terminal Late Classic times. Further excavation has shown that a surface of Late Classic masonry was laid over the great masks along the west base of the plat- form. Later, a long single-room structure with multiple doorways was built along the west base from corner to corner. This new structure corresponded in form and masonry type to the adjacent structures of the "Market Place" group excavated in 1964, and it was built to form part of that group. At this same time, the lower slopes of the southwestern corner of the platform were resur- faced with vertical walls, and a floor was laid at roof level over the long new building. There is no indica- tion that further construction was carried out above this level. Platform 5E-1 seems to represent an early structure of great size and importance that was severely robbed and then left obviously ruined throughout its upper portion. One wonders whether this destruction took place to gain fill materials for a local building project that never materialized. Alternatively, the Late Classic Maya may have lost interest in this old feature and deliberately allowed the top of the platform to revert to forest at the time they were building the long structure along the west base of the platform. Work by Jones in 1963 among certain twin-pyramid complexes of Late Classic Tikal illustrated the capacity of the local Maya to dismantle partially and leave in ruins construc- tion that had become obsolete. The 1964 excavations within the East Plaza were greatly expanded in 1965 to learn more of the form and development of the plaza as a unit. Contrary to what was reported earlier (January, 1965), the parallel long mounds known as 5D-42 and 5E-31 were found to be the two sides of a large ball court. The size of the court is approximately that of the main one at Copan, and the two courts share many features of form. The vertical faces of the side benches of this new Tikal court rise about 1 m. from the level, plastered, central playing alley. The tops of the benches rise to a vertical upper wall at an angle of 20?. No markers were found in the playing alley or on the upper walls. However, each of these walls was decorated with a carved hieroglyphic frieze. Along the tops of both structures were vaulted buildings, each with seven doorways facing the playing alley. Surprisingly, the spaces between the doorways were occupied by round columns instead of rectangular piers. These columns were made of radially set stone blocks. The inset stairs at one or both ends of the two parts of the other Tikal ball courts were not found here, despite a diligent search for them. Access from the plaza to the ball-court buildings (also unique) remains problematical. Possibly temporary wooden stairs or ladders were used, or access was by now-obliterated narrow stairways built into the ends of the playing benches. The rear and side walls of the ball-court structures rose vertically from the plaza and were decorated in an intricate manner by side and rear outsets, cornices at different levels, and receding upper zones, as if to simulate a vaulted build- ing. While no Imix (Tepeu 2) material was recovered from the fill of the ball-court structures, the masonry employed places their construction securely in Late</page><page sequence="11">462 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY V VOL. 31, No. 3, 1966 Classic times. Late minor repair to the court was found to be a well-preserved example of a structural type pre- that the court continued in use into early Postclassic times. Structure 5D-43, south of the ball court, was found to be a well-preserved example of a structural type pre- viously found at Tikal on two occasions. This is a plat- form with four stairways, one on each side, and plat- form faces constructed in a manner resembling "tablero- talud" components of central Mexico. In the case of Structure 5D-43, platform faces consist of a central verti- cal band with double circles or "eyes." Above and below this band are outward-sloping bands carved with re- peating designs that resemble sunrays. The profile here is strikingly like that of Puuc three-member moldings; it also resembles that of the carved, spindle type of Tikal vault-beam. Because of poor preservation, the previously discovered platforms of this type (see this section, Jan- uary, 1965) were thought to be of more usual "tablero- talud" form, that is, without the top outward-sloping band or molding. However, these platforms are so similar in form and decoration to the East Plaza platform as to suggest that all three shared the same type of facing. Unlike the other two structures, Structure 5D-43 had a square building on top with a doorway on each side. In late times this building was altered to a more templelike appearance by the addition of an interior medial wall and by blocking all but the north doorway. Among the graffiti found on this wall was an extraordinary one de- picting a ball court, ball, players, trumpeter, temple, and possibly a stela and altar, all in a single scene. Central Acropolis excavations continued in 1965 in three courts and in the ravine along the south side of this massive cluster of range-type "palace" buildings. A huge southern fagade of masonry construction was un- covered at several places along the south side of this acropolis. Two enormous side stairs cling to this fagade and provide a passage between the upper courts of the acropolis and the ravine area below. The ravine was crudely terraced, with the upper terrace along its north side paved and occupied. One vaulted structure was built against the base of the south masonry fagade of the acropolis. This building was sustained by the upper ravine terrace top. The bottom of the ravine was tested at its east end, the deepest portion. Clear signs of its utilization as a reservoir were found, although the esti- mated volume of water anciently maintained is much smaller than previously thought. However, it was suffi- cient to support the number of residents postulated for the Central Acropolis. Tunneling directly beneath Structure 5D-52, the upper component of the "Five Story Palace," revealed an Early Classic prototype. This was oriented north and con- sisted of four rooms, each interiorly decorated by a dado in red paint. The rear central room had been re- plastered, obliterating its dado. A wall in one of the end rooms was decorated by crude sketches in black paint. The main effort was made in the great east court of the acropolis. This court can be divided into three dis- crete subdivisions in its final stage of evolution. The dominant feature is the Early Classic Structure 5D-46. This building, with two stories and an interior staircase, underwent modification and additions during Late Classic times. Excavation on its axis uncovered two caches be- neath the west stairway, one of which was of a late Early Classic type containing, among other items, numerous small jade and shell mosaics. The east stairway has a series of flights, and all but the original flight were built in Late Classic times. Four burials were uncovered here. The evidence suggests a desire to exercise space restric- tion and traffic control. Throughout this portion of the acropolis one sees patios emerging from added construc- tion, gradual closure of small courts, sealing of doorways on exposed sides, and construction of auxiliary stairways while the main stairway was still accessible. It is specu- lated that this activity was related to needs of residential privacy. In Court 2, the site of "Maler's Palace," further ex- cavation of Structure 5D-63, a large U-shaped edifice, revealed a series of diminutive roof combs set along all edges of the flat roof. Vestiges of 14 survive; 18 may have been the original number. This is the first clear evidence of roof combs on range-type (palace) buildings at Tikal. A major program of clearing in preparation for con- solidation was begun in the Central Acropolis this year. The acropolis area (4.5 acres and 42 structures) has now been cleared of heavy growth, and removal of debris has begun. Consolidation work is now being done in Court 2. Intensive search throughout the Central Acropolis has failed so far to uncover an indisputable kitchen area for Classic times. At least one cooking area exists that relates to early Postclassic times. Moreover, large quanti- ties of Eznab (Tepeu 3) pottery occupy various spots within the east court and adjacent to the southern facade. These deposits contain a major percentage of domestic artifacts. Despite what appears to have been a heavy domestic occupation of the Central Acropolis in early Postclassic times, no associated construction has been found. The North Acropolis excavations (begun in 1958 and recently reported in Science, Vol 147, No. 3664) have been essentially completed. This past year saw excava- tion, as far as feasible, of Structure 5D-22, the large central north temple built in late Early Classic times and assuredly the most important religious structure of Tikal in that era. This badly ruined temple yielded unprecedented quantities of "dedicatory" and intrusive offerings, as well as intrusive subfloor deposits, the origin and meaning of which remain speculative. Axial tun- neling (begun in 1963) and removal of irreparable por- tions of its substructure revealed an earlier temple, 5D- 22-2nd, with a major frontal addition. Both have balus- trades (or "stair-side extensions") on the stairways, as well as large masks flanking the stairs on the two sub- structure terraces. The masks of the earlier temple were well preserved insofar as they were exposed; a stairway-</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT RESEARCH 463 block with a magnificent "sun god" face in stucco was discovered as a secondary feature at the top of the stair- way. Tunneling revealed a markedly smaller structure underlying the earlier temple. The entire sequence here occupies the time span usually attributed to Early Classic. The complexity of architectural addition and superimpo- sition made this excavation the most difficult of the North Acropolis work. In 1965, tunneling and trenching were done near the north and east flanks of the Acropolis (final stage) in order to gain detail for preparing plans and elevations. Structure 5D-32, a previously uninvestigated temple en- gaging the south face of the acropolis, is now under exca- vation to determine whether it overlies the twin of Structure 5D-34 to the west, and to test for further evi- dence of Postclassic robbing of room caches and other offerings. The latter has been well borne out by excava- tions to date. Structure 5D-33, a major Late Classic temple occupying the central position on the south flank of the acropolis, was in part dismantled in 1965. Excavated in 1960 and continually tunneled since, this temple has posed numerous problems concerning the mortuary, offertory, and architectural sequences that have proved, until recently, to be practically unsolvable through tunneling. This temple is now being dismantled. Under Guillemin's direction, Structures 5D-23-lst (about A.D. 250), 22-lst (about A.D. 450) and 20-lst (about A.D. 550) have been consolidated and in part restored. In the case of 5D-22, large portions of the intricate substruc- ture of -2nd have been left visible, with sufficiently pre- served links to interrelate visually both 22-lst and its predecessor, 22-2nd. By the end of 1966, the North Acrop- olis will have emerged as an incomparable and probably unique showcase of Early Classic lowland Maya temple architecture. Temple II, in the Great Plaza, was sufficiently tunneled to make it seem unlikely that anything of significance lies buried beneath it. Work this year in the temple rooms disclosed unexpected evidence of changes in plan while construction was in progress. Summer (1965) work in the Stela 23 Group has been most rewarding. Originally excavated in part in 1957 (Tikal Report No. 2), again in 1963 by Marshall Becker, this important medium-sized formal group required a final season of work to clarify its composition. It has been postulated that this was essentially residential with attached religious structures, that it began in the Early Classic, and that it probably had one or more stone monuments. In 1965, an Early Classic, south-oriented, range-type ("palace") building, Structure 7F-32, was excavated. Structure 7F-29 proved to be a range-type building of Late Classic date with a number of important features, such as an integral bench and subfloor burials. Off-axial tunneling within the main temple, Structure 7F-30, disclosed further important caches, as well as crucial details of sequent constructions at this spot. A large platform, possibly a kitchen, was also excavated. Structure 5C-54, one of the largest features at Tikal, was further excavated this year. Work in 1964 had shown that this huge pyramid, with its four stairways and flanking masks, was built far earlier than expected. Tests to the west showed deeply buried subfloor Tzec (Mamom) deposits. On the chance that this structure overlay perhaps the prototype of a structure like E-VII- sub at Uaxactun, tunneling was shifted in 1965 from the west to the east side (the orientation of the Uaxactun structure). Moreover, the building platform on top of the pyramid had been found to be facing east. A trench into the east stairway at its base immediately exposed a large cache, the main feature of which is a lidded urn of a type common in Cauac (late Chicanel) times. Inside the urn was a carved and brilliantly polished fine jade, fist-sized maskette or pendant of a bearded human head. The mouth is drilled slightly at its corners, the nose is slightly widened, the upper lip is pronounced, and a rectangular forehead ornament is outlined with a fine incised line. Until evaluated and published, this piece is perhaps best characterized as "stylistically enigmatic." Work now continues on this structure, and Preclassic discoveries can be expected to increase. The program of investigation in the Tikal "sustaining area" was accelerated this year. Project personnel have long been convinced that, despite considerable insight into the make-up of central Tikal (as outlined by Havi- land in Expedition, Vol. 7, No. 3), a more reliable basis for assessing local settlement patterns would have to be gained by searching for and recording whatever lies about Tikal. Preliminary estimates suggest that the ancient sustaining area may have comprised about the same area now occupied by the Tikal National Park, that is, 576 square km. This is a square area bounded by a survey cut and divided into four equal parts. To- gether with roads and trails, this "brecha" system pro- vides feasible access to large areas of the Park. Prior knowledge and recent exploration verify the existence of large numbers of "satellite" centers around Tikal and throughout the Park. During the summer, Puleston sur- veyed the south-central brecha, recording all features in a strip 500 m. wide and 12 km. long. This 1:5000 record provides the first comprehensive view of satellite patterns in the Tikal zone. A major discovery this year was Jimbal, north of central Tikal and slightly beyond the north boundary of the Park. The importance of this site to the problem of terminal "Classicism" lies in its monuments, two of which record the dates 10.2.10.0.0 and 10.3.0.0.0. Early preliminary publications on the Tikal sustaining area, including data on Jimbal, are now planned. It is clear, however, that a two-year program of systematic investigation (as was done this year along the south-central brecha) will be required to gain even a minimal view of the Tikal zone. It is hoped that funds and personnel can be gathered to accomplish this during the years 1967 and 1968. Meanwhile informal explora- tion continues. GARETH W. LOWE</page><page sequence="13">464 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 3, 1966 CENTRAL AMERICA EL SALVADOR. Stanley H. Boggs is preparing a report on his Tazumal excavations. Unfortunately, administra- tive and other university duties limit Bogg's field work to small test excavations, primarily in the important Cihuatan site. In one salvage operation Boggs obtained quantities of potsherds and five fragmentary wheeled animals. Although the existence of such wheeled figures in the area has been known for several years, this is the first time that they have been encountered in a controlled excavation. These wheeled figures also functioned as whistles. In this respect they differ from the wheeled animals of Mexico, the only other known group of such artifacts in the New World. How these two groups are related is still uncertain. Since Cihuatan is generally late and shows some Mexican influences, a northern origin of wheeled figurines is probable. HONDURAS. Since December, 1964, the Mission Arche'ologique Frangaise, led by Claude F. Baudez, has been working in southern Honduras. Twenty sites were found during a survey of the Fonseca Bay area. Pre- liminary sorting of surface collections and materials from test pits has revealed four complexes, which I3au- dez has linked with Mesoamerican periods. The Early Classic complex includes corrugated and mechanically decorated pottery types. Two bichrome types, one red-on-buff and the other negative-painted like Usulutan ware, and one polychrome type are present. Villages of that time were small and somewhat irregu- lar, but a plaza pattern was observable. Burials include primary inhumations and urn burials of children. The next complex is linked with the Late Classic of Mesoamerica. Like the first, this complex has some mounds, but these are never very prominent. Painted pottery, especially polychrome types with buff back- ground, are dominant. Influence from the Ulua-Comaya- gua regions is prominent, as has also been noted in eastern El Salvador (this section, Vol. 31, p. 136). In the third complex, influence from the Ulua-Com- payagua region declined. Plumbate sherds link this com- plex with the Early Postclassic. The background of poly- chrome pottery types changes to cream, and motifs, forms, and styles show similarities to the pottery of Greater Nicoya. These changes duplicate those of east- ern El Salvador. Bichromes, which were common in the first two complexes, are virtually absent in the third complex. The Late Classic complex described above is typified by mechanically decorated pottery. The same tradition has been noted in eastern El Salvador, where the last pre-Hispanic complex is characterized by a crude, often unpainted pottery with incised and applique decoration. Whether the change to painted pottery is the result of invasion from the north is uncertain. Baudez made additional test excavations at Lo de Vaca, near Comayagua. Materials found in these tests confirmed Canby's Yarumela sequence. The remaining months of the dry season were used by Baudez to exca- vate extensively on one Early Classic site and in one Postclassic site of the Fonseca Bay region. NICARAGUA. Of special interest to archaeologists is the publication of a volume on the pictographs of the Isthmus of Rivas by the Rev. Hildeberto Maria (Insti- tuto Pedag6gico de Diriamba). A later volume will cover the pictographs near Lake Nicaragua. COSTA RICA. The most important recent finds, accord- ing to Doris Stone and Carlos Balser, are three carved- slate plaques which served as backings for pyrite mirrors. One of these, incised in the Maya style, was found at La Fortuna in the San Carlos region; the others, in a Mexican style, were found at Guacimo in the Linea Vieja region. Unfortunately, all three were excavated by huaqueros, so that their association with other ma- terial is somewhat doubtful. Teams from the Museo Nacional of Costa Rica, headed by Stone and Balser, excavated at both sites following the discoveries. Five graves were opened at La Fortuna, three of which yielded complete or fragmentary uncarved mirror backs of slate. The associated ceramic materials suggest affinities with the Early Polychrome period of Greater Nicoya. How- ever, vessels from other graves demonstrate that the cemetery was used for a long time. Three graves opened by the Museum party at Gua- cimo did not contain mirror backs. The carved backs are said to have been associated with reused carved jades, various gold and tumbaga objects, and stone mace heads. Pottery vessels reportedly found with the plaques show affinities with the Stone-cist ware of Hartmann. Indications are that these graves are later than those at La Fortuna and that they originated either in the Middle or in the Late Polychrome period. Here again the lack of a firmly established stratigraphic sequence makes the temporal and cultural placement of these important finds impossible. However, these discoveries demonstrate again that trade with Mesoamerica as well as with Pana- ma and northern South America was important, and that this traffic followed long-established routes. Other investigations in Costa Rica include the testing of three sites at the confluence of the Rio Parrita and Rio Candelaria southwest of the Valle Central. Sherds recovered by Maria E. Bozzoli de Wille include some applique styles as well as polychromes. The affinities are obviously with the Costa Rican highlands. PANAMA. Field work has been more restricted than usual, and information is confined to investigations in Chiriqui. Tests by Roberto de la Guardia at the "Colum- nas de Batipa" produced some sherd material, and a party from the "Colegio Felix Olivares" excavated sev- eral urns of unknown age and affinity in a cemetery at Dolega. Klaus Wenzel, a Swiss engineer, made a field survey and prepared a map of some 20 stone columns on a hill named Gallina, south of David. More important for the archaeology of Panama has been the publication of some long-delayed results of field work, mostly conducted in the 1940's and early 1950's. Analysis of potsherds excavated by Stirling in</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT RESEARCH 465 1948 and by Willey in 1952 in the Parrita and Santa Maria zones has enabled John Ladd to bring order into the sometimes baffling diversity of local polychrome types and to assign them to definite phases. La Arena, the latest of the six discernible phases, is assigned to the 19th and 20th centuries. El Tigre, the next oldest, can be assigned to the Conquest period. That leaves four phases to fill the gap between the Sarigua phase and the Conquest. No absolute dates are available for Santa Maria, the earliest phase, and Ladd attempts no correla- tions with other phases in Panama. The following Early Cocle phase can be dated through its connections with the Venado Beach material, for which two radiocarbon dates are available. Ladd considers A.D. 960 as the more acceptable of the two dates and accordingly places the Early Cocle phase in the second half of the first millen- nium A.D. The succeeding Late Cocle and Herrera phases occupy the remainder of pre-Conquest time. This detailed study represents a major contribution to our knowledge of west-central Panama. It should stimulate further investigations and publications in this important and interesting region. Since the polychrome wares of this zone were exported over wide areas, we now have a basis for correlation of the different regional sequences in Panama into one interconnecting whole. Another contribution to the archaeology of this region has been made by Matthew Stirling. He reports on graves at El Limon, near Penonome, Provincia de Cocle, which contained pottery of Guacamayo type reported by Eva and Neville Harte. Stirling also reports a brief investigation in the region of Almirante Bay, Provincia Bocas de Toro, on the Atlantic side of the Isthmus. Although Columbus stopped here on his fourth voyage and encountered a dense population, no archaeological investigations had been con- ducted here. Stirling and his party tested three sites. Two of these, Darkland Cave (Boc-2) and Boca del Drago (Boc-3), seem to be contemporary, while the third, Darkland (Boc-1), is perhaps slightly earlier. Most im- portant is the discovery of fragments of Lerida Red-on- orange pottery. This type has been found occasionally in Chiriqui graves, but never in large quantities. As noted in an earlier report, there are indications that this type is trans-Talamanca in origin. This interpretation is now confirmed by Stirling's material. At the Bahia del Almirante, Lerida Red-on-orange tripods, the only shape found in Chiriqui, form part of a larger type whose other varieties were obviously not exported. A third report by Stirling is concerned with excava- tions on the islands of Taboga, Taboguilla, and Uraba in the Gulf of Panama. The most interesting pottery comes from Taboguilla 1, a midden with a depth of 1 m. Stratigraphic excavations revealed no differences by level, and Stirling believes that this site represents a single phase. This is rather confusing, since there are two groups of ceramics which would, without stratigraphic control, be interpreted as belonging to two different complexes. While the painted pottery is stylistically renminiscent of Parrita pottery, the mechanically decorated pottery has strong affinities with the Aguas Buenas phase of Greater Chiriqui. Not only are there definite parallels in incising, shell-impressions, red-on-buff zoning, and in the shape and placement of handles, but the type site of Aguas Buenas also produced a few sherds with combed decoration which could have been imported from Tabo- guilla. This suggests that the excavated parts of the Taboguilla 1 site were disturbed. Further excavation is imperative. The discovery of an earlier complex would strengthen the hypothesis of a zoned bichrome horizon in southern Central America. This horizon could then be traced from Nicoya to the Gulf of Panama. The area would have a definite basic complex which would make it possible to interrelate the early phases. The last publication on Panama archaeology is a report by Leo Biese on his salvage excavation at a site near Panama Vieja. Urn burials and extended inhumations comprise the bulk of the material recovered. There are strong links with the Venado Beach site, as well as with the Madden Lake area. Polychrome pottery types have affinities with the Parita-Cocle zone. Another type, with beautifully modeled animals in low relief, has been found in a broad area along the Canal Zone. WOLFGANG HAaERLAND LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA BRAZIL. Continuing his investigations on the Rio Grande do Sul coast, Eurico Miller spent two weeks during July, 1965, surveying a valley formed by two tributaries of the Rio dos Sinos, which flow from the plateau to the lowland. The terrain is a combination of gullies and small level areas around ponds. One area, 2 km. square, produced 38 sites. Most were nonceramic, characterized by crude choppers. Five had pottery of non-Guarani type. Numerous similar sites occur between an elevation of 400 m. and the summit of the plateau. Guarani sites appear to be restricted to locations below 200 m. elevation. Two additional preceramic sites have been found by Igor Chmyz in the state of Parana, under the continuing program of the Departamento de Antropologia, Facul- dade de Filosofia, Ciencias e Letras, Universidade do Parana. Surface material includes projectile points, scrap- ers, perforators, knives, and other stone artifacts. During January, 1965, excavations were conducted at a site to be destroyed by construction of a hydroelectric plant at Salto Grande de Iguagu' in the municipio of Bituruna. Circu- lar hearths outlined by stones were the only features identified. Artifacts included numerous flakes, cores, projectile points, scrapers, knives, and other instruments of quartzite. The occupation refuse was between 55 and 70 cm. below the present surface. During January, 1965, Nassaro A. de Souza Nasser of the Instituto de Antropologia, Universidade do Rio Grande do Norte, assisted by Elizabeth Mafra Cabral, conducted test excavations at the site of Vila Flor, on the southern coast of the state.

Piazza, Universidade de Santa Catarina, spent a week in survey of the Rio do Peixe, a tributary entering the Rio Uruguai near the center of the border with the state of Rio Grande do. Sul. Two ceramic com- plexes were identified, one with predominantly finger- nail decoration and the other decorated principally by brushing. A report has been prepared for publication. VENEZUELA. The Departamento de Antropologia, Uni- versidad de Los Andes, began paleoecological investiga- tions in the Valle de Quibor in 1963. The success of the initial program led to its expansion to other parts of western Venezuela. Mario Sanoja, Director of the De- partamento de Antropologia, is in charge of the research; Iraida Vargas is research associate. In addition to the analysis of the cultural remains, interpretation will be based on faunal analysis by Sanoja and pollen analysis by Vargas. Soil studies will be contributed by specialists of the Instituto de Geografia, Universidad de Los Andes. To date, the investigations have made possible corre- lation between the recent cultural and ecological se- quences in the Valle de Quibor and in the region south of Lake Maracaibo. In the former area, evidence points to ecological changes during the last occupation of the valley, beginning around A.D. 1300-1400 and continuing into the historic period, and resulting in the disappear- ance of mammalian fauna such as Mazama rufa, Odocoi- leus virginianus, and Sylvilagus, along with several species of palms and a primitive race of maize. The sequence south of Lake Maracaibo covers the period after A.D. 800. At this time, a low sandy region at the southern edge of the lake was occupied by a group possibly coming from the south. The fauna from early levels comprises principally peccary, anteater, and a species of turtle. Numerous species of terrestrial molluscs suggest increasing moisture. The upper levels are char- acterized by an arboreal fauna and other indications of a gradual transition from low to high vegetation, such as exists today in the region. Maize and sweet manioc were both cultivated, although the former may have been absent during the intermediate part of the sequence. Survey around the city of Merida has identified numerous sites related to San Geronimo, where intensive excavations have been made. Analysis of this material permits establishment of correlations with highland com- plexes in Lara and Trujillo on the basis of decorative techniques and vessel shapes. BETTY J.
