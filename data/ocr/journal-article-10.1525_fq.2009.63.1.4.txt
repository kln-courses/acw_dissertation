<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> editor’s notebooK AGAINST NATURE Antichrist (Lars von trier) Eric Rohmer’s films are undervalued. Certain objections recur  in the sparse English-language commentary: repetitive, socially  conservative, cerebral, uneventful, religiously inclined, reliant  on the arcane twists and turns of well-heeled conversation,  visually unimaginative. The director’s own remarks compound  the difficulty. Interviewed by Graham Petrie for this magazine  (summer 1971), Rohmer said: “my films are more like reading  than like watching a spectacle, they are made more to be read  like a book than seen like something on the stage.”  In their reassessment, Leo Bersani and Ulysse Dutoit do  not overlook Rohmer’s visuals, noticing moments which  “break discourse” and leave language behind.
