<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sociological Analysis 1981, 42, 1:57-67 The Social-Psychology of Religious Experience: A Naturalistic Approach* Roger A. Straus, Ph.D. Post Office Box 422 Davis, CA 95616 Religious experiences present a seeming paradox: they are felt to be direct, unmediated experiences of the Absolute, yet substantive religious experiences differ from one another in details and imagery in a way that clearly relates to their sociocultural, biographical and situational contexts. A naturalistic "so- ciological" social psychological approach is described in which this problem is resolved by differentiat- ing conceptual interpretation from perceptual analogizing and then examining the emergence of expec- tation, perceptual and intellectual metaphors, and the definition of the situation as a subject moves through his/her biographical experience toward the episode of triggering and having the actual ecstatic peak experience. The sociology of religion must come to grips with the central mystery of religion- tran- scendental experience. It is not enough to dismiss the phenomenon as an expression of so- cial or psychological forces. Nor ought the issue be skirted by declaring, as did Wach, that "religious experience, though related to the wide context in which it appears, is spontane- ous, creative, free" (1944:57). Granted, that to which Wach points is one of the strikingly generic subjective qualities of this class of (at least seemingly) transpersonal phenomena. However, no less striking are the cross-contextual and interpersonal differences in how subjects perceive, interpret and integrate their religious experiences in personal conduct and collective life. Fortunately, the state of "sociological" social psychology has advanced to a point where we can deal with such events in all their dynamic complexity without dismissing them outright, ex- plaining them away, or accepting subjective reports and interpretations at face value. Contextualist, dramaturgical analysis (Lofland, 1976; Sarbin, 1977) has already proved valuable in the naturalistic study of religious conversion (e.g. Straus, 1979). I contend that a similar approach can be developed for the scientific investigation of religious experience. At the core of this approach is the widely-accepted principle that a person's categories for understanding mediate their experience and are, to a highly significant degree, socio- culturally constructed (e.g. Berger and Luckmann, 1966; Mehan and Wood, 1975; Watz- lawick, 1976). This is most usefully conceptualized in terms of the definition of the situa- tion (Thomas, 1931), as a process and also a product of symbolic interaction (Blumer, 1969). *An earlier version of this paper was presented to the 1980 Annual Meetings of the Pacific Sociological Associ- ation, San Francisco, CA.

First, we should heed Bateson (1979) in differentiating acts of experiencing from those of interpreting. He viewed these as synergistic but alternating streams of mental process. Second, we must expand the scope of analysis to include organ- ismic and nonrational aspects of human behavior; that is, we need to adopt a holistic per- spective. Metaphoric Deformation A social psychology of religious experiences requires the radical claim that experiencing itself is socialized. Yet these are by definition transpersonal and transocial phenomena seemingly involving the cessation of normal conscious functioning in which experience is interpreted through socioculturally-constructed categories. They involve a sense of break- through into direct experience of an Ultimate Reality. A resolution to this paradox is suggested by science-fiction writer, Robert Sheckley, in his delightful epistemological satire, Mindswap: "Under the continuous and unremitting impact of the unknown, even the analogizing faculty can become distorted. Unable to handle the flood of data by the normal process of conceptual analog- izing, the subject becomes victim to perceptual analogizing. This state is what we call 'metaphoric deformation.' The process is also known as 'Panzaism'.... "The concept is self-explanatory . .. Don Quixote thinks the windmill is a giant, whereas Panza thinks the giant is a windmill. Quixotism may be defined as the perception of everyday things as rare entities. The reverse of that is Panzaism, which is the perception of rare entities as everyday things (1966:15-16). There is sound evidence for the contention that thinking is, indeed, a process of concep- tual analogizing (Sarbin, 1977). The reality of perceptual analogizing is strongly indicated by laboratory studies of both animals and humans, demonstrating an organism's creative role in acts of immediate perception (Bruner et. al., 1957; Forgus, 1966). It is warranted, therefore, to posit that human epistemological process (i.e. perceiving and knowing) involves mediation through socio-culturally constructed analogic catego- ries at both these levels. Conceptual analogizing is the basic mechanism of Bateson's inter- pretation or classification (1979), perceptual analogizing that of experiencing. The concept of metaphoric deformation can explain those contextual and individual differences in subjects' actual religious experiences mentioned earlier. This aspect of such experiences demonstrates how, even after intellectual activity is suspended, the subject may continue to organize onrushing experience at a literally unconscious level in terms of his or her taken-for-granted definitions of the situation. The Meaning of "Religious Experiences" Religious experience has been used to denote everything from participation in religious ceremonies to vague feelings of sanctity associated with the category "religion." In this pa- per, religious experience is used to refer to certain cases of Simmel's "response to what is ex- perienced as Ultimate Reality" (1959:30). These are those extraordinary episodes charac- terized by at least three qualities:</page><page sequence="3">THE SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 59 1. Peak experience (Maslow, 1964); an intensity or kind of "hyperconsciousness" involv- ing the sense of incomparably greater immediacy, significance, and reality than is charac- teristic of ordinary or mundane experiences in daily life. 2. Ecstasy (Laski, 1961); a breaking, broaching or release from one's taken-for-granted, socialized realities-the subject literally "stands outside" his or her self. 3. Transcendence; a sense of direct contact, cognizance of and/or identification with an Ultimate Reality underlying or transcending the material universe. This is felt to be a nat- uralistic, unmediated and immediate transpersonal experience of the Absolute, rather than some class of feelings, thoughts, imaginings or intuitions about that Reality. The social science literature tends to generalize all such experiences as "feeling states," enumerating attributes commonly associated with such events as a sense of undivided- ness, bliss, holiness, etc. (Stace, 1960; Laski, 1961; Bourque and Back, 1971). However, such an approach carries analysis to the point of vivisection, losing the essential qualities of the living experience-that sense of seeing, feeling, actually perceiving Something There. In this paper, I am attempting to avoid beating the phenomenon to death in such a fashion. A Strategy For Analysis of Religious Experiences To organize the discussion, I will speak of "having a religious experience" as a kind of archtypical human drama. My analytic strategy will be to follow the emergence of this par- ticular story line out of the potentially limitless possibilities for any one subject's life story. I have been using the terms "religious experience" and "religious experiences" more or less interchangeably. However, that's quite misleading. The fact of the matter is that no- body has "a religious experience." Rather, people have concrete, specific experiences which may be characterized by the above-mentioned qualities. We want to analyze systematically the unfolding of a subject's story in terms of a generic sequence of stages or themes. Specifically, we want to know about the life story of those who come to undergo or accomplish what we would describe as religious experiences. Since I am employing the imagery of"a story," we can describe this as a sequence of "chap- ters" climaxing in "Having the Experience." I. Framing. Every story begins with setting the scene and delineating the characters- otherwise it would be no particular story at all. Ours begins with a subject entering the hu- man scene at a given time and place in history and society. Interacting first with one's family and then with a sequence of peers, societal institutions and other reference groups, the subject comes to adopt a specific perspective, develop a unique personality, and proceeds to negotiate the various developmental stages and status passages of the life cycle as appropriate, permissible or at least plausible for one of their particular type, background, and social group. None of these events is the target of the emerging individual's striving; often there is no deliberate or even unconscious choice in- volved. These are merely what that person finds he or she must go through in the process of managing the business of living. A social perspective tells us that each of these reference groups, roles and events is linked into the total sociocultural ecology of a historical society. Two consequences of this con- textual framing are especially significant.</page><page sequence="4">60 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS First is that the stuff of which a human life is constituted-from the characters we enact, the self of which we a conscious, the real world we see and feel around us, the things we know, the sorts of expectations, intentions, pleasures, desires, fears and fulfillments we consider "only natural"- is all constructed in the course of our exchanges with socialized and acculturated others who are themselves situated in a particular niche within the total historical society. We are truly social-psychological creatures. Childhood is particularly important with regard to establishing our tacit understand- ings and root images (or metaphors) for the ultimate nature of self and reality. For exam- ple, as a child growing up in a Northeastern superb in the 1950's, one couldn't help but adopt a world-picture based on Christian metaphors of an anthropomorphic God. Even Jewish kids were continually exposed to these ideas and symbols. At the same time, that was the first cohort to be raised in front of a television set and force-fed with the mythology of the "technological fix." Ellwood suggests that socializa- tion-by-television generated our pop culture of swiftly-changing images and an expecta- tion for "accessible fantasy," which in turn set the stage for first the psychedelic culture and then the Jesus Movement (1973). A second aspect of framing involves the fact that growing up in a particular sociocul- tural ecology has critical impact upon the rules by which we organize the contents sup- plied by our "stimulus environment." We not only interactively construct grounds of meaning, but also the frameworks or schemata through and by reference to which we or- ganize behavior into conduct, recognize the very objects of perception, and interpret the information we receive through our senses. We learn how to automatically sort out and constellate, how to consciously and subconsciously draw outlines around the stuff of life, turning it into something recognizable and meaningful. Framing literally sets the scene, provides the background from which a particular hu- man story can emerge, establishes the conventions governing how the drama is to be per- formed, and blocks out the character(s) who will enact that story. However, except in ret- rospect, it gives neither analyst nor protagonist sufficient reason to expect that this will turn out to be a story of religious experience. It may, however, make that eventuality more likely than some others. II. Predisposition. In the second chapter, as our protagonist continues to engage in so- cial intercourse and cope with the circumstances of life, the plot literally thickens. Out of the possibilities for role, script, performance and audience, the actor begins to adopt an in- creasingly self-conscious identity, style and orientation. The person comes to organize "their own act." Switching, as I will frequently do, to the dramaturgical metaphor, we can speak of a per- son's definition of the situation serving as a rudimentary, often intuited script for the largely improvisational drama of human life. Specifying roles and performances, defini- tions of the situation continually emerge, shift and change as the various participants in a particular setting or story interact. Even as we struggle to become and to assert "ourselves," we find our choices structured by and situated within the social arrangements and culture in which we participate. Fur- thermore, to "be oneself" requires continuous negotiation with our fellow-actors who are themselves striving to fit us into what they see as the story of their own lives.</page><page sequence="5">THE SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 61 We organize our conduct within this ecological context in terms of what we take for- granted to be real and what we feel to be our needs and best interests. What we don't real- ize is that our definitions of these parameters are continuously being reconstructed as we integrate each subsequent performance and experience into our private, felt-more-than- intellectually-defined sense of the "big picture." In effect, as we play each new scene we progressively reinterpret the script. Selection of the next thing to do is increasingly constrained by the history of our previous choices, so as to exclude more and more possible lines of conduct as impractical, out of character, un- warranted or "not for us." By this stochastic mechanism, "contextual elimination" (Firth, 1964:69), a specific plot unfolds and takes on its own momentum. Particularly significant is the fact that those involved in a social network or group will tend to organize their own conduct in a way supporting the ideology and interests they share (Mannheim, 1936). Therefore, they will strive to get others to share and support the interests and perspectives of the social world for, which they, consciously or not, have be- come agents. To the degree that our subject has become involved in a social world, he or she tends to progressively assume its perspectives and becomes increasingly predisposed to enact roles and performances of a sort considered natural and desirable within that context. Groups may actively facilitate this by requiring participants to lay down "side bets" (Becker, 1964), by providing ritualized status passages (Strauss, 1959), and/or institutionalizing bridge- burning acts and other norms symbolizing self-conscious commitment (Gerlach and Hine, 1970). Certain interactional paths, then, can be said to predispose a subject toward having spe- cifically religious experiences. Most important are those in which the person comes to seek means of overcoming or resolving frustrations not only at the level of their basic human needs but also at what Maslow terms their "metavalues" (1971), and in the course of which he or she forms social or affective bonds with participants in religiously or spiritually ori- ented networks (Lofland, 1969). As discussed elsewhere (Straus, 1976, 1979), this situation brings the subject in contact with the ongoing social life of that group, provides him or her with specific "religious" met- aphors for organizing general experience and ecstatic-transcendental episodes (Bourque and Back, 1971), and offers social and practical means by which a person may acqure so- cial status, enhanced self-esteem and may literally transform their lives in the direction of Maslow's "self-actualization" (1964). However, culmination of this seeking in an episode of religious experience remains problematic. Bourque's preliminary findings, for example (1969), showed that participants in respect- able middle-class society who were well-educated and lived in the Northeast were no less likely than less-educated, underprivileged, rural Southerners to undergo some kind of peak experience. However, the first group is more likely to frame their episodes as "aes- thetic" rather than "religious" experience. It remains unclear whether this is more a function of background or of ongoing social participation. However, such findings support the idea that private experience is inti- mately tied to one's social context. There is apparently no intrinsic difference between "religious" and "aesthetic" (or the</page><page sequence="6">62 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS more recently defined humanistic-psychological) peak experiences. However, there is clearly an extrinsic social value to framing one's experiences as "aesthetic" and so tending to neutralize the potentially shattering and transformative qualities attributed to classi- cally "religious" or mystical experience (Clark, 1969) by defining what one has undergone as a feeling-state. As we saw in the 1960's, the successful and established group or individ- ual is severely threatened by the possibility that transcendental experiences may lead the subject to "turn on, tune in and drop out." Four factors seem strongly to predispose the subject toward having a specifically reli- gious experience as opposed to something else. One is that he or she has come to frame their sense of reality in terms of religious or spiritual symbols, metaphors and concepts. Most often this is brought out by adult participation in a spiritual milieu (Balch and Tay- lor, 1977; Bourque and Back, 1971) but builds upon ideas and images assimilated in early childhood. Second, the subject has undergone or is undergoing a series of crises, stresses, depriva- tions or frustrations that cannot be resolved or made sense of by reference to secular and materialistic categories or coping strategies (Lofland, 1969). Third, the subject gets the idea that "their kind of person" can have a religious experience, that doing so might re- solve their existential dilemmas, and that it has become a likely, plausible and desirable episode in the story of that person's life. As Laski puts it, "probably the one thing that prepares a person for a mystical experi- ence is to know that there is such a thing" (1961). The student of the sociology of knowl- edge would immediately notice two problems with this statement, however. One is that the subject really learns about a particular, named example of what we would term a mys- tical or religious experience. The other is that such are almost invariably embedded in the subculture of a social group. Therefore, fourth, the person picks up or is provided with a number of coaches, teachers or guides (Strauss, 1959) who take it upon themselves to help our subject get to the point of wanting and properly understanding the experience. These same facilitators will often be involved as well in helping the person actually have and then appropriately respond to the ecstatic event. All such judgements, obviously, are made from the perspective of the social group sponsoring a particular manifestation of religious experience. Ill. Programming. After some period of becoming predisposed toward having a religious experience, our protagonist has come to exhibit favorable attitudes, motivations and ex- pectancies regarding the proprietary experience of a particular social context. Now, in ef- fect, the person and the group take steps to "program" a substantive, meaning-filled and socially organized event. In their study of self-reconstitution processes, Sarbin and Adler have identified recur- rent themes by which subjects are prepared for having life-changing experiences (1970/ 197 1). The central theme is that of symbolic death and rebirth. Strategies, usually involving high arousal and cognitive strain, are carried out in order to draw the subject both intel- lectually and psychosomatically into a totally-involved performance of symbolically dying in order to emerge as a new self. Facilitating this, a group's experiential mystery is surrounded by ritual behaviors. These provide a safe, intersubjective context socializing the event and organizing it as a status</page><page sequence="7">THE SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 63 passage within the group. Common elements of such rituals-closing the eyes, staring, praying, chanting-serve to limit the seeker's "span of attention . . . enhancing his con- centration on the objects, goals and means of conversion" (Sarbin and Adler, 1970/1971: 613). Furthermore, proprioceptive stimuli -perceptual inputs from the subject's own body - are manipulated to shift perception of the world, reduce reality testing atr the sensory level, and help disrupt boundaries of the self. This is clearest where psychoactive substances are used as part of the process (see Grof, 1975). However, a "somatic basis for . . . symbolic death and rebirth" is more often established by the induction of fatigue states, excitement or relaxation, or by having the person position him or herself or move in a ritualized way (Serbin and Adler, 1970/1971 :614). The various forms of yoga rely heavily on such tactics. Additionally, social groups may employ direct or indirect suggestion (Sargant, 1961; Straus, 1978, 1979) and/or manipulate the pragmatics of communication (Watzlawick, 1976) to "program" a religious experience. As in evangelical prayer meetings, Gothic ca- thedrals or Zen temples, the social organization, architecture and ornamentation of the context may provide subtle messages tacitly defining the situation. IV. Triggering. At some point, our subject becomes ready to have a religious experi- ence. Everything that has gone before leads up to this moment. He or she stands poised on the brink. All that is necessary is for the subject and/or coaches to release or "trigger" (Laski, 1961) the climactic episode. Action is now directed along practical lines. Most often, the means are primarily social- psychological. The triggering process begins with evocation of intense absorption either in ongoing social exchanges or, as in meditational practices, in self-interaction. As dis- cussed by Tart (1975), such tactics are employed to organize an "altered state of conscious- ness," at least in a manner of speaking (Barber, 1970). The situation is manipulated to literally blow the subject's mind. At the same time, he or she is guided to perform an attitude of surrender, of letting-go and "allowing it to happen," taking the role of spectator rather than perpetrator of experience. This conduct precipi- tates the experiential episode (Straus, 1976, 1978, 1979). There is tentative evidence for the claim that a person may actually break through per- ceptual analogizing at the height of some of these sequences (Maslow, 1964; Grof, 1975). However, if so, it is rather like the semi-consciousness (or semi-transcendence) at the point of sexual orgasm; reality processing continues as one struggles toward release and snaps back almost immediately afterward. Rituals, preparations, coaching and other interactions during this "leading into" phase are organized to furnish the subject an epistemological frame or "set," a terminology and explanatory scheme by which the experience is imbued with a specific meaning. This set provides conceptual analogies and perceptual imagery for recognizing the "true" nature of what is being experienced. Such a frame socializes, structures, and routinizes the ecstatic event-if not at its height, at the point of emerging from symbolic death. Triggering may occur outside of organized social settings (Laski, 1961). However, almost invariably the means of releasing ecstatic peak experiences become embedded in a social group (Becker, 1967). Triggering then occurs within a specific cultural context delineating the boundaries of the experiential episode, identifying meanings for the event, providing</page><page sequence="8">64 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS self-fulfilling prophecies for how and when subjects will "come out of the experience," and establishing normative expectations for being, feeling, and acting reborn following that return. V. Having the Experience. In our culminating episode, the plot demands that the sub- ject have-or allow him or herself to have-the experience. Clearly, this division into stages is arbitrary, and for analytical purposes only. Discussion of triggering glossed over the religious experience itself; here we will look more closely at the social-psychological ele- ments of the phenomenology of actual religious experiences. Maloney points out, "religious experiences do not just happen to persons. Persons seek them out, expect them to occur, welcome them when they come, and interpret them through categories supplied by their past experiences" (1973:79). Grof's extensive observa- tions from psycholytic LSD therapy suggest that these "past experiences" may extend at least into the prenatal period (1975), but we'll simplify matters as if definition of the situa- tion begins sometime after birth. Even with this assumption, it is very difficult to deal both intelligibly and naturalisti- cally with peak experiences. Having wrestled with this problem for many years now, I am convinced that we can systematically investigate both their socialized and their transcen- dental qualities by differentiating three phases of such events as suggested above. First, there is an entry phase during which the subject continues to operate on a normal basis, processing experiential inputs at both the perceptual and cognitive levels of analo- gizing. Then, as the triggering methodology takes effect, "baseline consciousness" (Tart, 1975) is disrupted by attenuating or abolishing the subject's normal reliance on thinking and interpreting. As Sheckley cautions us, that does not mean that the subject is now experiencing with- out analogical mediation. Rather, he or she enters the second phase in which "conscious" or cognitive mediation has given way to perceptual analogizing. Normally the back- ground of conscious experience, this is a largely subliminal process. Every day life acts of perception are performed quite mechanically. Almost simulta- neously, one attends to the sensory environment, selects out of the flood of information that which is 'significant" from that which is "noise," constellates these data into a recog- nizable image or percept, notices the "object" or "event" as a whole, and only then - once it is "in mind" so to speak-subjects it to conscious thought. In turn, attention to and organi- zation of sense data into meaningful experience seems largely controlled by the Meadian processes of symbolic or intellectual thinking, identifying and interpreting (1934). Whatever its true origins, the percept itself always seems given by direct experience. Af- ter all, a person has nothing else to be conscious of than what he or she notices. As suggested in our definition of religious experience, an integral element of such occur- rences is the sense that perceptual analogizing breaks down in a third phase. While this may itself be metaphorical deformation, there is no compelling reason not to accept the possibility of such a breakthrough. However, if we do so, then nothing further can be said about this transcendent phase. It is a lacuna, a slipping out of the socioculturally estab- lished reality-but it is only a lacuna. Short of Buddhist enlightenment, humans are bound to return to our mundane plane; as one emerges from the heights of religious expe-</page><page sequence="9">THE SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 65 rience, first perceptual and then conceptual analogizing slip back into place. Whatever one has experienced in this third, transcendend phase, the only way in which it can be made accessible to the person in normal consciousness seems to be by translation into analogically processed form. Compounding this is the problem of metaphoric defor- mation around which Sheckley built his novel: if perceptual analogy is subconscious, how can you tell whether you are doing it or not, or when you have begun again after tempo- rarily ceasing? There is no way to avoid the problem of metaphoric deformation. Verge as our subject might toward escaping the perception of reality as a projection of socioculturally orga- nized definitions of the situation, the situation remains that what one experience-or at least what one can bring back from even transcendent experience-is neither the sponta- neous creation of the individual nor some intrinsic attribute of the object of experience. Rather, it is our best analogy to "the thing itself' as drawn from one's socialized experience and, possibly, the deeper levels of the unconscious (Grof, 1975). Panza, in other words, cannot help but see a funny-looking windmill; in his reality, there is no such possibility as a giant. The shaping of experience does not end with triggering. It is essential to distinguish the ideal worlds of analysis from the tangle of real life. From both my personal experience and my social scientific study of this subject, I conclude that, in actuality, both conceptual and perceptual analogizing-thinking and metaphoric deformation-fade in and out during even the most profound mystical experiences. Glimpses of the Infinite seem to be about the best we can hope for, or at least the most any human is likely to get. The persistence of reality screening may explain how one's social ties and pre-existing definitions of the situation seem to be so clearly reflected in religious experiences. The vo- cabulary a subject has learned to apply to such situations seems to have a particularly sig- nificant effect upon the seemingly spontaneous choice of perceptual analogies (Bourque and Back, 1971). This has certainly characterized my own findings in psychedelically trig- gered mystical-religious experiences (Clark, 1969) as well as those achieved through forms of meditation. Furthermore, the influences upon the subject do not end with triggering. It seems that how religious experiences are preceived is at least partially conditioned by the cues fur- nished by their social and material setting. These include symbolic stimuli presented by that context and also the verbal and nonverbal expressions of others participating in the setting. Substantive factors include music, religious symbolism, quality and content of in- teractions surrounding the subject. From my research (Straus, 1976), it is clear that the same individual can have different religious experiences at different times in his or her life. These tend to reflect the biograph- ical, social and situational contexts of the episode as discussed immediately above. How- ever, in each case the phenomenological quality is that of directly knowing the Transcen- dent. Yet the subject may seem to have perceived a different specification of the Infinite in each such encounter. Words fail at this task of describing the subjective perception of reli- gious experience. Yet, even years later, one can still feel what it is he or she is trying to com- municate; how, as it was actually being experienced, there was no dichotomy between</page><page sequence="10">66 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS metaphor and reality. Rather, it was there, that way, unarguably. Conclusion In religious experience we find the ultimate confrontation with subjective phenomenol- ogy. A person seems to be experiencing in a transpersonal mode an Absolute Reality un- derlying or transcending the social and material universe. Yet the social scientist cannot help but be impressed by the myriad correlations between this seemingly direct and unme- diated experiencing and its sociocultural and biographical context. If we are to develop a naturalistic sociology of religion, a scientific understanding of hu- mankind's religious dimensions based on what people actually experience and do, we can- not work deductively backwards either from some premise of the Sacred or a materialistic premise that religious experience is really a manifestation of something else. Rather, we must build our understandings piece by piece from actual observations of people doing their religion. Can such an approach deal with the seeming paradox of religious experience? I believe it can. In this paper, I have endeavored to bring together a social psychological strategy for analyzing religious experiences. I have sought to present an approach that allows for but does not necessitate the potentiality of actual transcendent experience. Inescapably, such an approach must be of a more eclectic, multi-disciplinary nature than conventional soci- ological social psychology. However, it remains firmly rooted in the symbolic interaction- ist tradition. Two areas for further investigation are immediately apparent. One is that of intensive social-psychological research into the triggering process: how does it actually work? The other involves developing more ethnographic-level and comparative data on religious ex- periences and their contexts. Sophisticated content analysis might then be used to eluci- date the interrelationships among biography, sociocultural and situational context, and religious experience.
