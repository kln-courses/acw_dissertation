<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIVINE OBJECTIFICATION The Representation of Goddesses and Women in Feminist Spirituality Cynthia Eller Anyone who has been to a checkout line in a grocery store recently or driven down a highway picketed with billboards can vouch for the fact that pic tures of women, often scantily clad, are everywhere. One hardly needs to browse an "adult" bookstore to find women's bodies on display. Since the 1970s, feminists have worked diligently to show that such representations of women in mainstream art, advertising, television, and films reinforce stereotypical views and lead more or less directly to women's subordination. It is said that it is diffi cult for observers to separate the (sexist) image promoted in such pictures from the real women who resemble them. Traffic in representations of women, femi nists have argued, becomes, in essence, traffic in women themselves, since "the [woman's] body has a usefulness for others independent or regardless of its own right to be."1 In other words, women are objectified. This analysis has prompted interesting questions. If representations of women are presently lending themselves so successfully to an atmosphere of sexism and oppression, is it possible to create images of women that are nonob jectifying? Is there a peculiarly "feminist" way to represent women, and if so, what is it? These questions have been much debated over the past twenty-five years without any consensus being reached. Some feminist artists and commen tators have insisted, with Peter Gidal, that they see no possibility of using "the image of a naked woman ... other than in an absolutely sexist and politically repressive patriarchal way" at this time.2 Others have argued-and have at tempted to show in their artwork-that the nonobjectifying representation of women not only is possible but is a critical part of the feminist project. I thank Margaret Miles, Susan Myers-Shirk, Carol P. Christ, Ann Braude, and Mary Beth Edelson for helpful comments on this article, as well as the members of the Center for the Study of Religion workshop at Princeton University and an anonymous reviewer for theJFSR. 1 Melody Davis, The Male Nude in Contemporary Photography (Philadelphia: Temple Univer sity Press, 1991), 3. 2 Peter Gidal, quoted in Lynda Nead, The Female Nude (New York: Routledge, 1992), 76.</page><page sequence="2">24 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Spiritual feminists are among those who have chosen to accept the chal lenge of representing women in a nonobjectifying manner. Since the move ment's inception, spiritual feminists have produced and adopted an abundance of female images that they regard not only as nonobjectifying but also as sacred and empowering. On the face of it, it would seem that spiritual feminist art is about as far as one can get from patriarchal representations of women. Yet, as I will argue, spiritual feminist art, for all its attempts at reinterpretation and inno vation, remains tightly wedded to artistic practices that have objectified women for several centuries now, and that have placed religious power and divine au thority in male hands. Whether these same practices continue to work to wom en's detriment once they have been taken over by spiritual feminists is an open question, one that this article seeks to address. Feminist Spirituality and Goddess Iconography If religions can be characterized as either iconoclastic (abhorring images of the divine) or iconophilic (relishing images of the divine), feminist spirituality is a clear example of the latter. Spiritual feminist worship, ritual, meditation, and magical practice are virtually always accompanied by visual images of the divine. Even in daily life, spiritual feminists are inclined to hang their goddesses around their necks, set them on their altars, or tack them to their walls. Statu ettes, paintings, calendars, and jewelry abound, and many small woman-owned and-operated businesses cater to this ongoing hunger for female symbology. Spiritual feminists also employ other sorts of images, including nonhuman ani mal images, trees, stars, geometric shapes, and even the occasional male image (though these are often all or part animal), but representations of women pre dominate. And increasingly it is not only spiritual feminists who purchase, wear, or display this artwork; goddess symbols can now be found in nonreligious venues and even in the mainstream culture. The use of imagery in feminist spirituality is intimately tied to and deeply expressive of the movement's thealogy.3 With their delight in images of the divine, spiritual feminists are saying things they feel cannot or should not be said with words alone.4 One of the central messages they are trying to communicate is that there was a time on earth when people worshiped goddesses in prefer ence to gods, when the "feminine" was held to be sacred, and when women were accorded a greater social status than they enjoy now. As Gloria Feman Oren stein writes, "The Goddess symbol... reminds women that our legitimate his tory has been buried, and that through its excavation we are learning how short 3 Spiritual feminists commonly use the neologism thealogy to indicate that they are reflecting on the divine as feminine, substituting the feminine Greek root thea for theos, which is masculine. 4 See, for example, Elinor Gadon, The Once and Future Goddess: A Symbolfor Our Time (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1989), 307.</page><page sequence="3">Eller: Divine Objectification 25 the patriarchal period in human history has been in comparison with the 30,000 or more years of matristic history in which goddess-centered cultures flourished in central Europe, Anatolia and the Near and Middle East."5 This central nar rative of feminist spirituality-what I call the movement's sacred history6 or, more broadly speaking, the myth of matriarchal prehistory7-is taught largely through images. These images include abstract designs stamped, drawn, or carved on pottery or stone, but the most commonly displayed images (on altars and in books and slide shows) are representations of women, especially female statuettes dating to Paleolithic and Neolithic times.8 Spiritual feminists use such figurines to help them and others envision what they believe were ancient, god dess-worshiping times, and to reflect on how it feels to recognize female power as sacred. The single most popular image is probably the so-called Venus of Wil lendorf, a four-inch figurine discovered in Austria and dating to the Upper Paleolithic, probably sometime between 27,000 and 21,000 B.C.E.9 Whether or not these images actually represented goddesses to the people who created them is anyone's guess, but this is how they are recognized and treated within the feminist spirituality movement.'0 5 Gloria Feman Orenstein, The Reflowering of the Goddess: Contemporary Journeys and Cycles of Empowerment (New York: Pergamon, 1990), 6. 6 Cynthia Eller, "Relativizing the Patriarchy: The Sacred History of the Feminist Spirituality Movement," History of Religions 30, no. 3 (1991): 279-95; and Cynthia Eller, Living in the Lap of the Goddess: The Feminist Spirituality Movement in America (Boston: Beacon Press, 1995), chap. 8. 7 Cynthia Eller, The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory: Why an Invented Past Won't Give Women a Future (Boston: Beacon Press, 2000). 8 Carol P.

How ever, other interpretations have been offered as well, including that they were intended to be dolls, erotic art, amulets or other healing or protective charms, or objects for use in initiation rituals.

There is a brisk traffic in goddess re productions within the feminist spirituality movement.1l These reproductions, selected from a wide chronological span, are customarily limited to southern Europe and the Near East, the geographic areas most prominent in the move ment's sacred history.12 In addition, spiritual feminist art has reproduced these prehistoric images through the imaginative identification of living women with ancient goddesses. For example, in a 1985 performance titled Revelations of the Flesh, Cheri Gaulke photographed a naked woman, smeared with clay, who posed as the Venus of Willendorf for a piece called Susan Maberry as the Earth Mother on the Day after the Nuclear Holocaust.13 Here there is both repetition and reinterpretation, as a figure recognizably like the Paleolithic Venus is em ployed to convey a contemporary ecofeminist message. Additional goddess images are adopted into feminist spirituality from liv ing religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Native American and Afri can religions, as well as from cultures now dead but known to have been pa triarchal (e.g., classical Greece, Aztec society, and medieval Nordic culture).'4 Often these goddesses are seen as "survivors" of prehistoric goddess-worshiping cultures. For example, a seventeenth-century bronze of the Tibetan Buddhist dakini Vajravarahi is said by Hallie Iglehart Austen to be derived-along with the rest of Tantric Buddhism-"from Indian matristic cultures."'5 Images of of the Goddess: The World of Old Europe, ed.

One particularly popular image is that of the "many breasted Diana," from second-century C.E. Ephesus, said to represent women and the earth and their shared ability to offer succor.16 These historical and contemporary goddess images, much like the prehis toric images, are used as jumping-off points for the creation of new spiritual feminist art. Names and mythological associations may be preserved, but the goddesses are given a completely different look: they become goddesses for today, deities that the women who create and consume them can feel themselves to resemble. The Waitresses, a feminist performance troupe centered in Los Angeles in the late 1970s and early 1980s, included a piece in their repertoire titled The Great Goddess Diana, which they performed in restaurants. Anne Gaudlin created and modeled a costume covered with breasts, and texts were read to restaurant customers explaining that "Diana was a goddess worshipped thousands of years ago. Great many-breasted Mother, ruler and nourisher of the animal kingdom, provider of sustenance, both physical and spiritual, for all crea tures, great and small."17 The text continued on to draw an analogy between this ancient goddess and contemporary women, who-especially as waitresses serve in similar nurturing roles. As Gloria Feman Orenstein explains, this per formance piece was "a critique of our society's devaluing of the Great Mother," performed "in the hopes of rekindling the proper relationship of love and re spect between the nurturer and the one who is nourished."18 Such performances raise another function of goddess images, the one that probably contributes most to enthusiasm for the iconography of feminist spiri tuality. Goddess images give spiritual feminists what spiritual feminist and art critic Elinor Gadon calls "a model of empowered selfhood."l9 Many such images have an aesthetic affinity to New Age art and to the heroines of fantasy and science-fiction comic books.20 They are used as meditative symbols, and they 16 Austen, 27. Classicist Walter Burkert gives an alternative reading of this statue: "The god dess 'of the many breasts' is so dear to psychoanalysts as well as to modern tourists that the simple truth, proved decades ago, can hardly prevail: the fact that these 'breasts' are not a multiplication of female sexuality but a kind of pectoral worn by the goddess, a detail linking the statue of Ephesus to other cult statues of Caria and its surroundings, including Cybele, Zeus of Labraunda, and even Atargatis of Damascus."

This image of the many-breasted Diana (or Artemis, as she is also called) was also used in 1978 in a performance piece in New York by Louise Bourgeois, who wore a tunic cov ered with breast images.

In much the way that a dieter will affix pictures of skinny models to her refrig erator to inspire herself with images of how thin she might one day appear if she will only keep the refrigerator door shut, spiritual feminists will place goddess images on their walls or altars to call forth a vision of themselves as powerful, unapologetically female, and often-in significant counterpoint to my example of the dieter-a solid fifteen to two hundred pounds heavier than the current fashion standard for women.21 Among these images are many with dark complexions. This raises the ques tion of the appropriateness of the predominantly white adherents of feminist spirituality using Black, Hispanic, or Asian goddess images. Some, both within and outside feminist spirituality, are troubled by what seems to them to be a very familiar romantic and implicitly colonial use of nonwhites as "spiritual." Indeed, such stereotypes are readily identifiable in spiritual feminist art and writing.22 Most spiritual feminists, however, regard their use of nonwhite images as a well-intentioned attempt to show the inherent beauty and power of women from all races and thereby to underscore the shared femaleness of women worldwide. In feminist spiritual terms, what is most important about all of the bodies in the art of the movement is that they are female, and obviously so. With the rarest of exceptions, the images have hips, breasts, and rounded stomachs; when more than one figure is present, they come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and ages. When they are older, their breasts sag and their waistlines thicken. When they are younger, they are frequently shown pregnant, giving birth, or menstruating. Birth-giving is an especially common theme. Monica Sjoo, Swedish artist and coauthor of a massive "history of the Goddess," de picted childbirth in a painting provocatively titled God Giving Birth (1968),23 which elicited storms of protest when it was first displayed. Similarly, Meinrad Craighead's work Garden (1980) is an icon of woman as womb, with the central figure's outstretched arms forming fallopian tubes and her blood-red chest, shaped like a uterus, containing an infant.24 Harper &amp; Row, 1983); Austen, 150; and Zsuzsanna Budapest, The Grandmother of Time (San Fran cisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1989), 68. 21 The heft of the goddesses imaged by spiritual feminists is often commented upon by the women who revere them and is self-consciously used to combat current pressures on women to be thin. One set of goddess images, developed by Willow LaMonte, is titled "Fat Goddesses: Uh Huh, That's Right!" and is described as a "slide show of multi-sized female deities and sacred 'big-boned gals' from around the world." Viewers are invited "to participate in a 'taking up space' attitude!!" Listing in "Cauldron of Events," Goddessing Regenerated 6 (1997): 1, 3. 22 A critique of this romanticism can be found in Rosemary Radford Ruether, Sexism and God Talk: Toward a Feminist Theology (Boston: Beacon, 1983), 84-85. 23 Monica Sjoo and Barbara Mor, The Great Cosmic Mother: Rediscovering the Religion of the Earth, 2d ed. (San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1991). 24 See Gadon, plate 22.</page><page sequence="7">Eller: Divine Objectification 29 These images are much in keeping with spiritual feminists' emphasis on female bodiliness and the qualifies they say this type of bodiliness imparts: nur turance, intuition, compassion, a comfortableness with sexuality, and a strong connection to nature. Rather than placing divinity in a transcendent, invisible realm, spiritual feminists image the Goddess residing on planet Earth, some times being planet Earth. In spiritual feminist art, vines twist about women's limbs, their eyes form pools of water, their hair mimics flowers, and animals sit on their laps or are born from between their legs. Judy Baca's 1976 por trayal of Califia, the Amazon queen after whom California was named, shows a sturdy woman whose arteries become tree roots and whose arms become tree branches.25 The same theme is found in drawings that decorate the pages of spiritual feminist magazines, such as an untitled piece by Wahaba Heartsun showing the figure of a reclining woman whose breasts and hips double as hills, and whose hair (head, underarm, and pubic) resembles trees.2 Such images are intended to illustrate that the goddesses of feminist spirituality are immanent, familiar, and completely comfortable in and inseparable from the natural world. A number of prominent feminist artists of the past twenty-five years have worked with similar themes. Indeed, there is an important link between the feminist art movement and feminist spirituality. Some commentators have argued that feminist art by early pioneers such as Leonora Carrington, Frida Kahlo, and Georgia O'Keeffe is the very foundation for the feminist spirituality movement.27 For others, the effect goes in the opposite direction, with feminist art taking its inspiration from feminist spirituality.28 Whatever the direction of influence, artists such as Judy Chicago, Meinrad Craighead, Louise Bourgeois, Mayumi Oda, Nancy Spero, and Mary Beth Edelson have worked with themes that simultaneously or later found their way into feminist spirituality. (Some of these artists have explicitly defined themselves as part of the feminist spiritu ality movement.) Feminist "body art" (which involves the artist's body in either production or performance) is especially congenial to spiritual feminist the alogy, and many of the resulting images have been adopted into the iconography of feminist spirituality. Some of these, such as Mary Beth Edelson's Grapceva Neolithic Cave: Seefor Yourself (1977) and Luisa Francia's Dragontime (1991),29 are basically photographic records of ritual acts that would be much at home in the feminist spirituality movement. Also included in the iconography of feminist 25 See Orenstein, 92. 26 Wahaba Heartsun, illustration for "Fantasy Magick," by Nan Hawthorne, SageWoman 3, no. 9 (Spring 9989 [1989]): 19. The date 9989 A.D.A (after the development of agriculture) is a date of convention sometimes used in Goddess circles. 27 See, for example, Orenstein, chapters 4 and 5. 28 Gadon, 371. 29 Heide Gottner-Abendroth, The Dancing Goddess: Principles of a Matriarchal Aesthetic (Boston: Beacon, 1991), plate 29 (for Edelson); Luisa Francia, Dragontime: Magic and Mystery of Menstruation (Woodstock, N.Y.: Ash Tree Publishing, 1991), 48.</page><page sequence="8">30 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion spirituality is a variety of more abstract forms called "vaginal art" (pioneered by Judy Chicago in The Dinner Party [1974-79]).30 In these images, women's breasts and/or genitalia are given central treatment. For example, Clara Me neres's Woman-Living Earth (1977) works with the theme of female-as-earth by rendering the torso of a woman in sod and grass, shaping the soil and clipping the turf to draw attention to nipples, navel, and pubic mound.31 With an implicit reference to the Paleolithic Venus of Laussel, Ana Mendieta's Ruprestian Series (1981) involved cutting female images into the limestone caves of a moun tainous area outside Havana that, according to Gadon, "has traditionally given shelter to Cuban rebels but was once sacred to the Goddess."32 Unlike the Venus of Laussel, however, Mendieta's female figure has only rudimentary arms and head and no breasts, but is dominated by an inverted teardrop-shaped vagina. In a more populist vein, one of Wahaba Heartsun's drawings in a spiritual femi nist magazine is a stylized vulva that is completely disembodied.33 These, then, are the female images that form the art and iconography of feminist spirituality. I think there can be no question that these images are em powering for some women. Spiritual feminists insist that they are so for them, and there is no reason to doubt them. Certainly spiritual feminists do not feel themselves to be objectified when they place a statuette of the "sleeping god dess" of Malta or the Buddhist Tara on their altars, even if they are perfectly capable of feeling objectified when they have to squeeze past a man poring over a pornographic centerfold at their local newsstand. The goddess iconography of feminist spirituality is not identical to mainstream representations of women, and even when it is similar, the context in which it occurs shifts its meaning in a more female-positive direction. Still, I see two dangers arising from the representation of women and goddesses in feminist spirituality. The first is the perpetuation-however un intentional-of a long-standing tradition of objectifying women and reducing them to their sexual parts. Though nonobjectifying representations of women may be possible and spiritual feminists may ultimately prove this through their art, placing such emphasis on often naked images of women is, I believe, a more complex and treacherous undertaking than spiritual feminists take it to be. The second danger is that representation itself, apart from any tradition of objectifying women, may be problematic; something important may be lost in consenting to one's own representation, to one's own reduction to an image on a piece of canvas or in stone-a problem that extends to the representation of 30 See Judy Chicago, The Dinner Party: A Symbol of Our Heritage (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press/Doubleday, 1979). 31 See Gadon, plate 24. 32 Ibid., 280-81. 33 Heartsun, illustration for "Fantasy Magick," 18.</page><page sequence="9">Eller: Divine Objectification 31 deities. The debate over this question has raged across cultures and millennia and will not, of course, be answered here. On the one hand, Hebrew prophets and Christian iconoclasts have railed against the presumption that the divine can or should be imaged, and Muslim artists have generally refused to represent either gods or humans.34 Some indigenous peoples have reacted with hostility and suspicion to anthropologists armed with cameras, believing that the dupli cation of images of themselves would diminish their personal autonomy, power, and safety. On the other hand, Hindus, Buddhists, and Orthodox and Catholic Christians have rich iconographic traditions that glory in multiple images of the divine. Europeans began making images of specific human beings (especially rich or important ones) from classical times forward, and that practice has only mushroomed as photographic technologies have become widely available. It is important to recognize that spiritual feminists do not choose to be iconophiles out of ignorance or naivete. There are thealogical, philosophical, and psychological reasons why spiritual feminists have opted for an extensive iconography, many of which I have mentioned already. But there are benefits to be gained from an iconoclastic position as well, and I think it might be helpful for feminists to reconsider these. Representing Women, Representing Men Before asking whether spiritual feminist art has succeeded in breaking out of a visual language that objectifies women, it may be helpful to discuss in greater detail how some art theorists and feminists have understood the pro cess of objectification. Many have argued that the very act of looking involves, in Laura Mulvey's words, "taking other people as objects, subjecting them to a controlling and curious gaze."35 If this is indeed the case, it is important to de termine who is looking and who is being looked at. In Western culture, espe cially with the advent of modern media, everyone does a tremendous amount of looking-women as well as men. But what are they looking at? Dispropor tionately (though obviously not exclusively) we, male and female alike, look at women. What does it mean for women to concentrate their gaze on themselves and other women, to "watch themselves being looked at," in John Berger's words?36 A classic feminist answer is that this practice causes women to be split internally 34 See Lois Ibsen Al Faruqi, Islam and Art (Islamabad, Pakistan: National Hijra Council, 1985), 17; and Annemarie Schimmel, "Islamic Iconography," in Encyclopedia of Religion, ed. Mircea Eliade (New York: Macmillan, 1987), 7:64-67. 35 Laura Mulvey, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema," in Feminism and Film Theory, ed.

Heide Got tner-Abendroth, a German spiritual feminist and proponent of what she calls "a matriarchal aesthetic," describes the work of British artist Cosey Fanni Tutti as an example of this self-determined, self-expressive representation of women. Cosey Fanni Tutti photographs herself "in poses similar to those in porno graphic or striptease pictures," but, as G6ttner-Abendroth maintains, "here she is not an object but the artist, i.e., the subject reclaiming its identity.... She presents herself here; everything is determined by her and seen through her eyes.... Her life is now her own work without any outside influence."41 Cosey Fanni Tutti rarely appears in spiritual feminist iconography, but Carolee Schneemann, a performance artist active in the 1960s and 1970s, is still regarded among spiritual feminists as having given clear voice to what they wish to say about bodiliness, femaleness, sex, and nature. Photographs of Schneemann's performances continue to be reproduced in spiritual feminist publications. One of these, Interior Scroll, first performed in 1975, involved Schneemann removing her clothes, painting her body, and reading from a book. Toward the end of the performance, she dropped the book and began reading the text from a scroll she pulled out of her vagina, representing, she said, "the 37 Or, as some theorists would have it, he who looks and she who is looked at-"the gaze," as in temalized by women, being considered "male."

We must assume a masculine position or masochistically enjoy the sight of woman's humiliation."

Gadon inter prets Eye Body as "a defiant act of exorcism. [Schneemann] wanted to ... free women from the bonds of male-defined pornography, to give women back their own bodies.... She was challenging the traditional use of the female nude in Western art as an object to be manipulated."44 However, lacking the information that these performance pieces were de signed to show the wisdom and power of female embodiedness, a viewer might reasonably conclude that Interior Scroll was from a live sex show and Eye Body from the pages of a porn magazine. Does this matter? Griselda Pollock suggests that it does not, that "images are not received as discrete entities but in relation to institutional frameworks and discourses. The work can be defined as 'femi nist' at the moment it enters into the arena of these debates."45 Granting this point, it still seems to me that the similarity between some spiritual feminist art and male heterosexual pornography indicates an omission in most spiritual feminist understandings of art: the role of the spectator.46 Spiritual feminists frequently seem to assume that spectator reaction will invariably follow artist intention. If the artist is a self-conscious feminist, the message the spectator re ceives will be to see women, their bodies, sex, and nature in a new and liberating light. Schneemann herself interprets her work like this: Covered in paint, grease, chalk, ropes, plastic, I establish my body as visual territory. Not only am I an image maker, but I explore the image values of flesh as the material I choose to work with. The body may remain erotic, sexual, desired, desiring but it is as well votive: marked, written over in a text of stroke and gesture discovered by my creative female will.47 Schneemann acknowledges freely that she is manipulating her body as a visual object (contrary to Gadon's interpretation in the preceding paragraph), but she 42 Heresies Collective, The Great Goddess, rev. ed.

Yet images can clearly have an impact that their creators do not intend. Spectators will, I believe, in the absence of a compelling reason to do otherwise, read images such as Schneemann's in the established vocabulary for representa tions of women.48 Therefore, what they will see is a sexual object; not the whole, female, sexual, self-determining person Schneemann seeks to represent. The presence of these images in spiritual feminist settings, in rituals, and on altars may give women the compelling reason they need to read such images in non traditional ways. But these images do not remain safely closeted within their alternative religious world, nor are they intended to be so contained. Once they are set free to reach a broader audience, it seems unlikely to me that they will continue to be read as assertions of female autonomy and power. They will simply be naked women. And we have all been trained from childhood on, by everything from television commercials to art history classes, how to look at naked women: appraisingly, possessively, dismissively. As Lucy Lippard put it in 1976, anticipating later feminist art theory, "A woman using her own face and body has a right to do what she will with them, but it is a subtle abyss that sepa rates men's use of women for sexual titillation and women's use of women to expose that insult."49 A now hotly debated distinction between "naked" and "nude," originally put forward by art historian Kenneth Clark, asserts that the nude is the body as produced by culture, through art, while the naked is simply a body without clothing.50 The nude elicits murmurs of aesthetic appreciation; the naked elicits shock and embarrassment. And, not insignificantly, exposed female bodies are typically "nude," while male bodies similarly exposed are "naked." As Melody Davis explains, "The female body, omnipresent in all visual media, suggesting nudity even when clothed, finds no equivalent in the male nude who, when he appears, is quickly covered by silence, suppression, and outrage.""5 The conventions according to which women's nakedness can be viewed as art while men's is generally hidden are not timeless universals. Classical Greeks favored male nudes long before they began to peel away the clothing of their goddesses. Late medieval artists routinely portrayed a naked Jesus suffering on 48 H. G. Kippenberg argues that "when we read a drawing we are looking for stereotypes we have in mind already." "Iconography as Visible Religion," in Eliade, 7:5. 49 Lucy Lippard, quoted in Nead, 67. 50 See Kenneth Clark, The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form (New York: Pantheon, 1956). Lynda Nead points out, quite rightly, that "the discourse on the naked and the nude ... depends upon the theoretical possibility, if not the actuality, of a physical body that is outside of representation and is then given representation, for better or worse, through art... [but] the body is always already in representation" (16). Certainly this is true; but images of male and female nakedness, equally repre sentations of the body, are coded quite differently. 51 Davis, 3.</page><page sequence="13">Eller: Divine Objectification 35 the cross, as well as a naked Adam and Eve being expelled from the Garden of Eden. Renaissance artists painted nude men in-secular contexts and, like con temporary feminist artists, sometimes used themselves as models.52 In fact, right up until the late eighteenth century, the male model was the norm in drawing classes and art studios.53 But another trend was already under way by the seven teenth century, during which "the relationship between male artist and female model [was] sexualized, artistic creativity [was] equated with sexuality, and more specifically with male virility." By the nineteenth century, male nudity dis appeared almost entirely in Western art, while the naked female assumed center stage, with "nude" even becoming a shorthand for "female."54 Feminist commentators have tended to see the earlier predominance of male nudes and the later predominance of female nudes as two variations of pa triarchal representation. In the first case, the artist "identifies with God making man," while in the second case he sees himself "as a Pygmalion who makes in every sense of the word-his ideal woman."55 This argument draws our focus back to the artist, for just as spectators are bound to some extent by the viewing conventions of their culture, so are artists. Again, this is something that spiritual feminists tend to overlook. In spiritual feminist interpretations of art, it is often assumed that the artist can free herself from the visual lexicon of her own cul ture, that her reasons for representing women and her manner of doing so are chosen from a position of zero constraint. As Gottner-Abendroth says of Cosey Fanni Tutti's art, "Her life is now her own work without any outside influence." Such a claim is not credible. Why did she take poses typical of pornography and striptease? It was because of outside influence, because there exists a tradition of visual representation of women that emphasizes women's sexuality and takes them as objects. Why did she choose to represent herself and not a model? This is a more interesting question, for self-representation is a defining fea ture of feminist "body art," and it is true to the self-referential intent of all spiri tual feminist iconography. It is also, ironically, an instance of the same internal splitting of viewing subject and viewed object characteristic of the ordinary ex perience of women in a culture that objectifies them: with one "self" they are their bodies and nothing more; with the other "self" they watch those bodies and monitor them, "exercising a fearsome self-regulation."56 Now, female artists' self-representations are not inevitably contrary to women's interests. As noted, artistic conventions change and shift, images signify different things to different generations and cultures. If male nudity can demonstrate male centrality and dominance, as it did during the European Renaissance, why can't female nudity 52 See Margaret Walters, The Nude Male (London: Paddington, 1978), 96. 53 Nead, 47. 54 Walters, 181, 228. 55 Ibid., 13. 56 Nead, 10.</page><page sequence="14">36 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion convey a sense of women's power now, regardless of what it meant a hundred years ago, ten years ago, or even yesterday? Obviously it is the goal of most of feminist art, so designated, to represent women in a manner that subverts the stereotyped representation of women in contemporary culture. No feminist artist is trying to retrench the sexual objecti fication of women. Particularly in the heyday of the feminist art movement in the early 1970s, feminist artists set out to distinguish their self-representations from male representations of women in as graphic a manner as possible. Pre senting vaginal imagery and dealing with subjects such as menstruation, these artists "challenged the aestheticization and sanitization of the female body within patriarchal culture."57 Feminist artists broke the dominant code of the female nude and attempted to show themselves as "speaking subjects," demon strating visually how they experienced their own bodies. Although these women were naked, they were not naked in the same way as in the elite art of nine teenth- and twentieth-century Europe, nor in the same way as popular com mercial images of female nudity today. There can be no doubt that talented artists can and frequently do confound viewer reactions and established artistic codes, and perhaps some spiritual feminist art is able to do just this for female images. But neither spiritual feminists, as artists, nor their audiences can es cape the larger context in which their art takes place, a context in which naked women code quite directly as sex and as object. Trying to use the very means of women's oppression to free them may be ingenious, but I question to what degree it is successful. Is there a substitute? As it happens, spiritual feminists are not looking for a substitute to feminist body art, because they wish to keep much of the standard coding of female nudes in place.58 Spiritual feminists, by and large, have no complaint with seeing women as representing sex, the body, and nature; their complaint is rather that sex, the body, and nature have been denigrated, and women along with them. Their goal in representing women is not so much to deconstruct the standard coding, then, but to set it in a positive light. As Carolyn McVickar Edwards out lines the spiritual feminist project, "First, we take back, over and over again, the sacredness of our Woman selves: our bodies; our sexualities, our birth-giving, creation-making beings. Then we retrieve from misuse and abuse all the con cepts the patriarchy relates to our femaleness: body, blood, under, deep, color, dark, below, wetness, depth, intuition, divination."59 How better to accomplish this project of celebrating nature and the body, of redeeming everything tradi tionally associated with femaleness-if this is one's aim-than to use represen tations of women? 57 Nead, 63. 58 Rosemary Betterton, An Intimate Distance: Women, Artists, and the Body (New York: Rout ledge, 1996), 14. 59 Carolyn McVickar Edwards, The Storyteller's Goddess (San Francisco: HarperSanFran cisco, 1992), 5.</page><page sequence="15">Eller: Divine Objectification 37 I believe that there is at least one better way. If the goal is truly to redeem nature and the body for the greater good of Western society, it must eventually be a project of the entire culture and not just a project for women. According to spiritual feminist logic, women know a great deal about the value of body and nature from their long-standing relegation to this realm (or, as some would have it, because women actually are closer to body and nature for biological reasons). The people who really need to get in touch with the value of body and nature, it would seem, are men. And I doubt, given past cultural experience, that they are going to discover this value by contemplating pictures of naked women, or even by standing idly by while women contemplate pictures of naked women. It is a commonplace of feminist analysis that Western men have attempted for cen turies to abstract themselves away from nature and the body, and to the ex tent that they have been successful, it is largely because women have taken care of-have been-the body stuff for them. This is not a scenario that feminist spirituality, as it is currently constituted, disrupts or even attempts to disrupt, since its art is not directed at men. But if spiritual feminists are truly committed to fostering a harmonious relationship between human beings, materiality, and the natural world, perhaps they should concentrate their attentions on imaging men in ways that emphasize male embodiedness and connection to the natural world. Lynda Nead has championed feminist artists for representing female bod ies as "a way of... reversing the gaze and enabling women to become the speak ing subjects of discourse."60 However, feminists' artistic renderings of them selves as goddesses or women are not reversals but rather variations upon the objectification and, more importantly, self-objectification of women in Western culture. Spiritual feminists continue to engage themselves in a form of narcis sism, even if it is a much healthier form than, for example, contemplating pic tures of fashion models to motivate one's self-starvation. There may be nothing intrinsically wrong with this healthy narcissism, but the feminist art project is incomplete so long as women avert their eyes-as patriarchal cultures have tra ditionally trained them to do-from men. It is this act, the act of looking at men, that is a far greater threat to the status quo of gendered power inequalities. It is a true reversal of "the gaze" for women to look at men-not peripherally, deferentially, but head-on. To some extent, male dominance has thrived within an invisibility that spiritual feminist art leaves untouched. As Peter Lehman states in Running Scared: Masculinity and the Representation of the Male Body, "In patriarchal culture, when the penis is hidden, it is centered.... Indeed, the awe surrounding the penis in pa triarchal culture depends on either keeping it hidden from sight (as ... the classical cinema does) or carefully regulating its representation (as the porno 60 Nead, 68.</page><page sequence="16">38 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion graphic film does)."'6 Maryse Holder interprets the absence of male genitalia in men's art as a source of power for men, explaining that "the penis was not for the public consumption, but for the private exclusive enjoyment of men. Nor, of course, were men to be sexually defined-in that regard, as in all others, they were the see-ers, not the seen."62 When women represent themselves, they raise the possibility of changing the way women are perceived, both by themselves and by men. But when women represent men, they position themselves as sub jects with eyes that look out at the world rather than exclusively back in upon themselves. This is a powerful move, regardless of the outcome. Some feminist artists (though no spiritual feminists) have already taken on this project of representing men and their embodiedness. A mid-1970s exhibi tion at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London featured 'Women's Images of Men" (though it is interesting to note that in the book of essays based on this exhibition, only slightly more than half of the illustrations were of naked men unaccompanied by women).63 Sylvia Sleigh, also working in the mid-1970s, painted several male nudes, using two models whom she apparently regarded as embodiments of her personal male ideal.64 Connie Greene, while a student at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1974, asked her (male) professors-who taught drawing and painting using nude female models-if they themselves would be willing to pose naked for her, and several agreed.65 Representations by Sleigh and Greene confound the expectations for male nudity set up by Western art, in which naked men are either suffering mortifications of the flesh (as in Christian representations of Jesus or the saints) or taking heroic poses and en gaging in physical activity (again emphasizing their subjectivity even as they become objects on canvas or stone).66 In these feminist representations, men are pictured unclothed and inactive, being naked rather thanjust happening to be naked. I do not mean to imply that men are necessarily women's objects of erotic desire and should be portrayed as such by spiritual feminists in order to beat men at their own game (which has arguably been about representing women as objects of male desire). I mean only to draw attention to the simple fact that we live within a culture that prizes gender duality, whatever our sexual orienta 61 Peter Lehman, Running Scared: Masculinity and the Representation of the Male Body (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1993), 28. 62 Maryse Holder, "Another Cuntree: At Last, a Mainstream Female Art Movement," in Raven, Langer, and Frueh, 12. 63 Sarah Kent and Jacqueline Morreau, eds., Women's Images of Men (London: Pandora, 1985). 64 See Cassandra Langer, "Against the Grain: A Working Gynergenic Art Criticism," in Raven, Langer, and Frueh, 120; and Walters, 317. 65 See Walters, 317. 66 See Carol Duncan, "The Aesthetics of Power in Modem Erotic Art," in Raven, Langer, and Frueh,67-68.</page><page sequence="17">Eller: Divine Objectification 39 tion.67 And indeed, spiritual feminists, a few exceptions notwithstanding, prize gender duality as much as-if not more than-the cultural mainstream. In the world of feminist spirituality, "we" are women and "they" are men, and much of what needs to be known about life, history, and the future can be read off this duality. But men are visually prominent in feminist spirituality only in their ab sence. Spiritual feminists rarely pause to acknowledge this.68 Lise Vogel worries that "the logical consequence [of representing men] ... is a simple extension of current sexual conventions, so that men will become more objectified and women will be permitted to participate in sexploitation as oppressors."69 There is some evidence that this is already happening: sexually suggestive images of men are increasingly found in mainstream advertising, and responses to psychological surveys indicate that men are increasingly preoccu pied with their appearance and less satisfied with their bodies.70 Yet one can hope, from within a spiritual feminist worldview, that female representation of men would lead not to an equality of objectification but to a recognition by all that we are embodied; that no one has a monopoly on rational thought or bodily connectedness; and that we can all take up the position of viewing subject and viewed object interchangeably. Providing women with a "gaze" of their own that can look beyond the self is one possibility for feminist and spiritual feminist art, as is continuing the effort to work with female imagery. These may in fact be the only possibilities we have. Perhaps we cannot, or do not, live without representation, and if we wish to redress gender inequalities or harms, we must do so, at least in part, through visual attempts to "subjectify" women, to offer an emancipatory means of self representation, or, potentially, to decenter the hegemony of gender altogether.7 Refusing Representation There may be another possibility for spiritual feminist art, however: that of refusing representation altogether, or at least taking a hiatus on the represen tation of women. It may be that we are at a time, historically speaking, when the set of meanings associated with the representation of women is so entrenched 67 Regardless of a significant presence of lesbians in the feminist spirituality movement (surely more than in the general population), goddess images are almost uniformly read as idealized self representations, not as expressions of lesbian desire. The woman who is seen is not the other, but a manifestation of the self. 68 An exception is Elinor Gadon, who believes that "in time the new iconography will include a new symbol of male identity, one not based on dominance and violence" (372). 69 Lise Vogel, "Fine Arts and Feminism," in Raven, Langer, and Frueh, 40. 70 David M. Gamer, "The 1997 Body Image Survey Results," Psychology Today, February 1997,42. 71 See, for example, Nead, 16; and Mary Ann Doane, "Woman's Stake: Filming the Female Body," in Penley, 217-18.</page><page sequence="18">40 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion that it is folly to try to communicate alternative conceptions of female existence through the medium of naked women. And with eating disorders and expensive cosmetic surgery continually on the rise, it might be a good time to insist that women have a value far beyond the shape or size of their bodies.72 This is not to say that societies cannot exploit women without objectifying them in visual images. Male dominance has all sorts of tools in its chest, and objectifying rep resentation is only one technique (as the relative lack of objectifying repre sentations of women in patriarchal cultures such as classical Athens or con temporary Iran attests). But, given that it has been an extraordinarily successful technique in Western culture, especially in recent years, there is something to be said for refusing to play that game rather than simply calling for different rules. In addition, there is a certain religious appeal to swearing off the repre sentation of women or, more particularly, goddesses. Let me illustrate by high lighting a photograph from Ana Mendieta's 1977 series Tree of Life. Here is how Gadon describes this image: "Her naked body bathed in mud, [Mendieta] stands against an enormous tree, a living icon."73 The word icon here resonates with power, and since this is a female image, we might expect that power to de volve upon women. But for whom do icons exist? Never for themselves. Their existence is always for another's use. Though an icon is a different type of object, perhaps, than a woman in a slinky dress slithering across the hood of a car in an automobile advertisement, it is nevertheless an object. Thus, it need not be surprising that goddesses have been represented and worshiped in many locales on the globe without any concomitant rise in the social, political, or economic status of human women.74 Even in the prehistoric world, which is reconstructed 72 Feminist spirituality often claims that women are more in tune with their bodies and less in clined to be alienated from material nature than men. Yet one could argue that the evidence cuts the other way: that women are more alienated from their bodies than men, because they are more will ing to inflict pain on their bodies in the pursuit of an attractive appearance and are generally more dissatisfied with their bodily selves. See, for example, Susan Bordo, Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1993), 57; and Bartky, 66. 73Gadon, 279. 74 Discussions of the relationship between goddess worship and women's social status can be found in LarryW.

But the iconographic choices of feminist spirituality leave in place a tradition in which goddesses can be trivialized-seen as the exotic deities of foreign cultures or the stuff of fantasy novels-while the male god hovers invisibly in the subconscious, exerting an at times overwhelming force. Feminist spirituality did not create this tradition, and it stands in firm opposition to it. It will change this tradition if it can. But until this tradition is successfully undermined, feminist spirituality in Western culture perforce plays to a broader audience that has been schooled, on the one hand, to accept the all-powerful God's near-invisibility and to expe rience it as a sign of his strength; and, on the other hand, to associate icono graphic representation with spirits, saints, and deities who are lower in the di vine pecking order. Taken together, the dominant Western religious traditions-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-are strongly iconoclastic. Both Islam and Judaism have produced religious art, but neither permits any representation whatsoever of God.76 Christianity is a more delicate case, as it has never had a consensus re garding the representation of God. Most early Christians believed, in concert with Greek philosophical aniconicism, that "God was invisible and could not be represented... because God was an immaterial and spiritual being."77 But later 75 There is some archaeological and ethnographic support for the possibility that iconic goddess worship was accompanied by worship of a supreme male god who was never represented and would therefore never turn up in the material record. This combination has been attested, for example, in the case of some African and American indigenous religions. In addition, in one archaeological excavation dating to Iron Age Israel, large numbers of female figurines were re covered, but virtually no male figurines (Frymer-Kensky, 158-61). It is only because of existing written records-the Hebrew scriptures-that we know that this culture was "really" worship ing a god. That is, the worship of a god was the official religion of Israel, from which any putative goddess worship indicated by the figurines would have been considered a deviation, perhaps even a heresy. 76 See Alan Unterman, "Judaism," in A New Handbook of Living Religions, ed. John R. Hin nells (Oxford: Blackwell, 1997), 44-45; and Jacob Neusner, "Studying Ancient Judaism through the Art of the Synagogue," in Art as Religious Studies, ed. Douglas Adams and Diane Apostolos Cappadona (New York: Crossroad, 1987), 30-31; Al Faruqi, 7: 14-18; and Schimmel, 7: 64-65. 77 Paul Corby Finney, The Invisible God: The Earliest Christians on Art (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), x-xi.</page><page sequence="20">42 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Christians developed a rich and elaborate iconography, in spite of spates of iconoclasm (most notably between 724 and 843 C.E. in Byzantium and in West ern Europe during the Protestant Reformation).78 Still, in all this religious art, representation of the Father God of Christianity is quite rare compared to that of Jesus, Mary, and other biblical and religious figures. It is often limited to "a series of symbols and images," such as "the right hand with which he created and judged, the triangle inscribed with an eye, the initial T (for Theos), and a tri angle surrounded by rays of light."79 Jesus, the second person of the Christian trinity, has been imaged at least as often as any other religious figure. Since, according to Christian orthodoxy, Jesus is "fully divine," images of him could be considered by the devout to be images of God.80 But standing behind Jesus-usually invisibly-is the Father God. The omnipotent divine to whom Jesus speaks, to whom Jesus defers while on earth ("thy will be done"), lives in the heavens, somewhere that human eyes cannot reach. Anthropomorphic images of the Father God did appear in both Western and Eastern Christendom through the Middle Ages and can be found yet today in some Orthodox and Roman Catholic iconography. The old man with the long white beard whom so many of us visualize when we think of God the Father is not the product of some mythic collective unconscious nor of explicit verbal instruction in church school classes, but rather of a persistent (though often purposely obscured) iconography of God in this form. Still, the iconoclastic tendency in relation to God in the Christian tradition is very strong. Both believers and nonbelievers in North America and Western Europe gen erally understand that the referent of the term God is invisible (moreover, incapable of representation) and nominally male, in spite of, on the one hand, occasional representations that belie God's invisibility, and on the other hand, theological apologetics that insist on "his" lack of gender. These are the cultures in which spiritual feminists make their bid for female divinity. Their Goddess or goddesses are inevitably compared to this invisible (or barely visible) male God. And, barring any great sea change in Western the ology, in comparison to this God, the Goddess will appear lesser and more easily contained, simply because she can be imaged. Spiritual feminists are banking on such a sea change; indeed, they are actively trying to bring it on. Unless and until this day arrives, representing the Goddess may make her especially accessible 78 See Finney, 3; Virgil Candea, "Iconoclasm," trans. Sergiu Celac, in Eliade, 7: 1-2; and John W. Cook, "Christian Iconography," in Eliade, 7: 60-61. 79 Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, Dictionary of Christian Art (New York: Continuum, 1994), 146. 80 This is especially the case in the Pantocrator icon of Christ found in Eastern Christianity, which "emphasizes the presence of Christ as coetemal and coexistent with God the Father." Cook, 59.</page><page sequence="21">Eller: Divine Objectification 43 and attractive to people (in the same way that many Christians save their devo tion for Mary, Jesus, or the saints, all of whom can be portrayed), but at the same time it will tend to undercut her divine power. In other cultures, in other con texts (even earlier in the history of Western culture), the opposite might be the case: visual images of goddesses might be just the thing to advance the feminist project. But in this culture at this time, goddess iconoclasm has merits that are too often overlooked. In some of the earliest words attributed to him in the Hebrew Bible, God says that he is not to be reduced to images of any kind; not even so much as a name should be applied to him. "I am," he says, and insists that that will have to be enough.81 This gives God a power and a mystery, and, it could be argued, it gives men a power too, by virtue of their shared gender with this God. It seems to me that this sort of power-the power of being beyond representation, the sense that there is something too grand, too indeterminate, too full of potenti alities to be captured in an image, or even in many images-might be healthy for women at this time. What spiritual feminists might be best advised to do, then, is to invoke a Goddess who is mysterious and unseen and unknowable, and to appropriate a little of her power-the power of being beyond represen tation-for women. On the face of it, this approach seems incompatible with the immanent, material thealogy that feminist spirituality takes as its corner stone, but I see no reason why the inability to be captured in images necessarily translates to transcendence, to a deity that is outside, beyond, or at an infinite separation from mere mortals. Perhaps the Goddess could be regarded as the immanent mystery that is around us and in us, invisibly permeating our exis tence and the entire natural world with her wonder and power. Whatever course we take, the road ahead is not easy. If, with spiritual femi nists, we strive to image women and the Goddess in new, empowering ways, we will be swimming against a powerful cultural tide of fe-male objectification, one that shows no signs of abating. If, on the other hand, we attempt to refuse rep resentation, we run the risk that that same tide of female objectification will rush in to fill the visual void we leave behind. Just as the new pictures we paint of ourselves may be imbued with old meanings by spectators, a vocal claim to visual privacy may be heard as a return to Victorian modesty, or-just as bad it may not be heard at all. We live in a profoundly visual culture. Speaking to this culture may require images, in which case spiritual feminists are heading in the right direction. I think it is too soon to know which strategy will work best to free women from images of themselves that demean, stereotype, or objectify them. But before casting our lot with the purveyors of putatively new, nonobjectifying 81 In Exod. 19:21 and 33:20, "we are told that the person who looks upon God face-to-face must die." In Exod. 20:4a, God tells Moses that any representation of him is explicitly forbidden. Finney, ix-x. Deut. 27:15 repeats this theme.
