<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL NOTES. SOME IMPLICATES OF THEISM. All things consist' in God, is the brief statement of theism. That is, they are grounded in him. They exist because he subsists as their root. The brief statement of pantheism inverts this: God consists in all things; is their sum, not their ground; exists because they exist. Theism and pantheism agree that God is in all things, the immanent and universal Energy. But theism affirms more; pantheism, no more. Pantheism holds that this energy first becomes conscious when con- scious beings like man proceed from it. That is, consciousness is a product of evolution. Theism reverses this. It holds that evolution is a product of consciousness; that the energy immanent in all things is also a transcendent energy, consciously originating and sustaining all, but exceeding all that proceeds from it. This affirmation is the distinctive mark of the theist, who is sometimes ignorantly criticised as a pantheist by those who hold a deistic conception of God as a Maker extraneous to his works. No pantheist could affirm this more positively than the apostle Paul (Acts I7:28; i Cor. 12:6; 15:28; Eph. 4:6; Phil. 2: 13). But Paul was no pantheist. Leaving pantheism here, one asks how theism more precisely understands God's immanence and God's transcendence. Under the term immanence the theist expands the popular idea of the divine omnipresence, as an all-seeing eye, into the thought of God's all-energizing intelligence, as ever active, not only throughout all space and time, but also within all visible forms of existence, giving birth to all being, maintaining all motion, efficient in the activity of all life, never interfering with the orderly workings of nature or of mind, while ever absolutely controlling them. This statement by no means rules out the possibility of miracle in the legitimate sense of the word, denoting, as it does, what is preterhuman, not in an absolute, but in a relative sense; relatively, that is, to the existing range of human knowledge and power. But the chief problem of theism is to reconcile the conception of the immanent divine control of all things with other conceptions which at first glance it seemingly contradicts, viz., (i) the 'For this use of the word see Col. I: I7 (R. V., margin). 316</page><page sequence="2">SOME IMPLICATES OF THEISM freedom and responsibility of human action under this absolute con- trol, and (2) the benevolence of God notwithstanding the evil of the world. The solution of this problem may be briefly stated thus: I. As to the evil will, as in a sinful man, the theist affirms the divine energy as immanent therein, but that the sinner's will is none the less responsible, because free. This for the following reasons: (i) Nothing that exists can be in any way external to the Infinite Being. "In him we live" is true of all that lives, of devils as of saints, though in very different ways. (2) The impulses even of tigers and vipers are included in the complex of executive forces by which the world-process is carried on, a collective term for which is the will of God. So are the tigerish or viperish impulses in the men whom the higher ethical impulses fail to control. (3) These lower impulses, being a part of God's work in nature, are not evil in themselves, but evil only when antagonizing the higher, or willed in preference to the higher. Appetite and passion, like fire, are good servants, bad mas- ters. (4) Will, whether divine or human, is self-directive power. The Infinite Self being inclusive of all finite selves, the Infinite Will must be inclusive of all finite wills. But these, though thus included, are none the less self-directive, or, as we say, "free." We virtually admit this whenever exhorting a bad man to become a better man. Were he not free to do as exhorted, exhorting him would be foolish. The con- sciousness of such freedom is an ultimate fact and irrefutable. (6) Full scope for such free self-direction of the finite will within the Infi- nite Will appears in the indefinite variety of ways in which it must be conceived possible for the divine purpose to realize itself in an effect- ive but non-interfering control. (7) The sinner's self-misdirecting will is therefore his own in enough of freedom to incur responsibility. The sinner virtually admits this in every self-reproach for not having done what he tells himself he could and ought. (8) His self-misdirecting will, therefore, included but free within the Infinite Will, is included only to be triumphed over in just condemnation for the misdirection, as guilty as free. The foregoing considerations may be stated otherwise, and more briefly, thus: (i) But for the continual supply of divine energy our life could not sustain itself. (2) In a sinful act the sin is the freely perverted use of this divine energy. (3) This perverted use is the act of a self-misdirecting or sinful will. (4) God is immanent in such a will simply as immanent in the man. The man's will is simply the 317</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY man willing. His self-directive power in willing is of God. God is in it as power and control, not as direction to evil. (5) Hence, while the power is God's, the self-direction is the man's own. Hence his responsibility for it, his guilt in self-misdirection. Conscience affirms this as an ultimate fact. Beyond this- "This main-miracle, that thou art thou, With power on thine own act and on the world," no analysis can go. II. As to the other half of the theistic problem, the vindication of the divine benevolence, notwithstanding the seeming contradiction of it by the evil in the world, the practical solution is in a comparison of the alternative beliefs, that the Infinite Being is (i) malevolent, or (2) indifferent. The decisive considerations are these: (i) A belief to which great contradictions appear must be accepted, if still greater contradictions appear to the alternative belief. (2) To determine the line of least contradiction, the apparent dynamic tendency of the whole course of things thus far must be taken into view, not the static condition of a given time or fragment of it. (3) In such a view there is manifest a steady, though slow, process of eliminating the evils of the world; a slow, but continuous, growth of a benevolent spirit in the world; a faith gradually spreading and increasing, in the face of all the suffer- ing of the world, that God is good; an intense conviction of many of the greatest sufferers in the sovereignty of the divine goodness as con- trolling even the evil for benevolent ends. (4) On the principle that the whole is greater than a part, reason must accept this testimony of the general course of things -a testimony fatal to the alternatives of malevolence or indifference. Reason is therefore bound to hold that benevolence controls the evolutionary process, notwithstanding the seeming indications of isolated facts to the contrary. From these problems involved in the immanence of God we pass to those involved in his transcendence. This is usually conceived as implying that God exists above and beyond a universe supposed to have limits. We must, indeed, conceive of any universe consisting of material forms as limited. We cannot conceive of formless space as limited, or less than infinite. But infinite space must be pervaded throughout by the same universal forces as any finite part of it in which they pass into various forms. Similar conclusions hold as to duration infinite. God's transcendence, therefore, cannot be conceived as spatial or durational. It does not connote quantity of being, either 3 8</page><page sequence="4">SOME IMPLICA TES OF THEISM as extraneous to the outermost star, or as out-measuring immeasurable space or time. Its true import is quality of being. It is illustrated in the fact that a Shakespeare is greater than any or all of his works. In affirming, with a scientist like the late Professor Cope, that evolution is the product of consciousness, theism both affirms and interprets the transcendence of God. It is the essential quality of the constant Producer as distinct from that of the transient product; of limitless thought as distinct from limited things; of the perfectly conscious as distinct from the partly conscious or non-conscious; of Self-Existence as distinct from derived existence; of Life Infinite as distinct from life in finite forms. Only in the spatial and mechanical conception, thus ruled out, can God's transcendence seem detached from his immanence, as if an outsideness of God, either to the universe of space and time, or to his immanence in it. His immanence filling all space and duration, there is no space or duration reserved for any transcendence that can be quantitativelv conceived. Only quantita- tively is it rationally conceivable. It is dynamic, spiritual, vital, belonging to the very idea of an immanent conscious life that is self- existent and eternal. Consequently, any supposed distribution of functions between God transcendent and God inimanent-for instance, the one as hearing and answering prayer, the other as energizing nature-is wholly illusory. The transcendent is involved in the imma- nent, the vital in the mechanical, the "supernatural" or spiritual in the natural, the infinite in the finite, the sacred in the secular. "Nature is spirit," said Principal Fairbairn. Only as immanent the transcendent Spirit, as St. Paul said, "worketh all in all." The forces by which God makes a plant grow and a religion grow differ as the forces which we exert in mechanical work and in moral work. The ultimate force is spiritual. Its modes of energizing differ only as its ends differ. The Infinite and Eternal Energy whence all things proceed is identical, as Herbert Spencer declared, with that which wells up within us under the form of consciousness. The astronomer Herschel com- pared the force of gravitation to the pressure of a Universal Will. The ripe theologian goes farther: "All cosmic power is will," says Dr. James Martineau. This has been notably reaffirmed by a great scientist. "The whole universe," says A. R. Wallace, "is not merely dependent on, but actually is, the will of higher intelligences or of one supreme intelligence." This is in striking accord with Augustine's saying, if not Augustine's philosophy: " Dei voluntas est rerum natura." 319</page><page sequence="5">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY To think of the Divine Will as an energy outside of the evolutionary process of nature, and occasionally breaking into it with interference or cataclysm, is grossly anthropomorphic. To conceive of the Will of God as extraneous to the forces resident in nature, and to divide and separate these from it, as the unconscious from the conscious, the material from the spiritual, is fallacious. The evolution, being the product of consciousness, must be the product of conscious Will, and the ultimate "resident force" is therefore spiritual and moral. Either God is not at all in the resident forces which carry on the evolutionary process, or she is consciously and actively in them as immanent Will. The drama of history, no less than the process of nature, exhibits that "toil co6perant to an end" which evinces control by Executive Mind -a term identical with Will. Its mode of working defies analysis. We can affirm only that it is ever from within outward, from the center; but "God's center is everywhere, his circumference nowhere." One who thinks of the Divine Will as working in innumerable separate acts of volition-one for every raindrop, etc.-needs to reflect that our own will, whenever we walk, does not put forth a separate voli- tion for every step, but depends on the automatic operation of the lower nerve-centers, which it both sets in motion and keeps to their work. Furthermore: from the theistic statement that the evolution is the product of consciousness it follows that it is not reasonable to think of the highest products of human consciousness, as ethics and reli- gion, as any more outside of the evolutionary process than the lowest forms of nature, organic or inorganic. From the lowest to the highest, in the social organization of ants and the mechanic art of beavers, and no less in the constructions of statesmen and churchmen, executive mind, that is, conscious will, is found working with other resident forces, termed "lower" because of the lower nature of their product, to all which it is related as generic force to specific. Only as one Uni- versal Will underlies all particular wills is there a basis of concord for all these as co6perant in a common purpose. But the higher we ascend through the grades of organized life, the more we find of con- scious will in a free adaptation of means and ends. In man a range&amp;of self-directive power is reached which obtains for his will, as contrasted with that of beavers, ants, etc., the name of "free." Yet is his will only a larger artery than theirs for the controlling current of the Uni- versal Will, whose time-long evolutionary flow constitutes the Self- Revelation of the Eternal One. 320</page><page sequence="6">SOME IMPLICA TES OF THEISM Here in this fact of the imperium in imperio of man in God, a con- ditioned independence that is wholly dependent, we reach the cloud- line of the mountain. To the ultimate question of psychology, What am I? no conclusive answer, says Lotze, can be returned. Only from the standpoint of the Absolute, says Professor Seth, can we be abso- lutely intelligible to ourselves. We must rest in the confession: "Our wills are ours, we know not how; Our wills are ours to make them Thine." Finally, the universe of things and wills is a living Universe because rooted in one self-existent Life, in whom all being subsists. There is a phenomenal duality of life, as derived and underived; no real duality, as divine and undivine. The life of the insect may seem undivine, because so dim and rudimentary. Life in its highest range and full development is seen to be divine, as in the Christ. Yet even to the humblest form of life, the flower in the crannied wall, the poet truly said: " r.... if I could understand What you are, root and all, and all in all, I should know what God and man is." Nothing finite is only finite. Not only is it in the infinite, but the infinite, at once immanent and transcendent, is in it: "Intra cuncta, non inclusus, Extra cuncta, non exclusus." And this infinite is an infinite Life. It is infinite, not as if indeter- minate, but rather, says Dr. E. Caird, as being inexhaustible. It is infinite, not as if extended outside of limits known as finite, but rather, says Dr. Caird again, as without any limits except those which it imposes on itself. The true infinite, then, is not the unlimited, but the self-limiting. That kenosis, or self-limitation of the divine, which St. Paul saw in Jesus, is the universal characteristic of the infinite Life which we name God. Its kenosis, a humbling of the highest to the lowest, is seen, as Dr. Samuel Harris says, in all the forms of finite existence that variously manifest the infinite life in which all finite life subsists. Thus all life is in its essential unity divine. The life tran- scendent is ever becoming life immanent. Life immanent is at the same time ever one with life transcendent. The temporal thus included in the eternal, in consciousness of what it is, may say: "Before Abraham was, I am." JAMES M. WHITON. NEW YORK, N. Y. 321</page></plain_text>
