<plain_text><page sequence="1">Postmodernism, Pragmatism, and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past1 Gideon Calder Every image of the past that is not recognized by the present as one of its own concerns threatens to disappear irretrievably ... In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it ... Only that historian will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmly convinced that even the dead will not be safe from the enemy if he wins. And this enemy has not ceased to be victorious.2 We must keep traces, traces of events, because there is a general trend to destroy.3 Much recent theory of an anti-foundationalist or 'post-isť hue has made a point of returning us to historicity. If modern theory sought the universal, then postmodern theory has favoured the particular, the situated, and the historically contextual: the little narrative, the silenced voice, the marginalised other. This is, to be sure, a simplifi- cation of both sides of the comparison. But it opens up a pressing question. What kinds of relationship to historicity are opened up by postmodern theory? In an age when relations with the past have taken on a particular kind of resonance - through truth commissions, retrievals of underplayed or silenced events, commemorative projects, and in a more general sense, a concern for the historical contexts of group and individual identities - what help does such theory offer us in seeking a grasp of such relations? In this paper I explore these background questions with reference to two recent strands in anti-foundationalist theory: Richard Rorty's neo-pragmatism, and Keith Jenkins's postmodernist treatment of his- toriography. Both approaches seek fresh perspectives on our relation- ship to history which reject the aspiration towards a perspective positioned at any kind of Archimedean point, beyond the clutches of time and chance. Both might be called 'historicisť in the sense that rather than seeking to play down or to escape the flux of contingency, they seek to embrace it. And both, it seems, seek a kind of 'zero Theoria, December 2005</page><page sequence="2">Postmodernism, Pragmatism, and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past 83 point', as Adorno once called it: a plea to 'forget' the stain of past thinking and experience in order to begin on a new footing.4 They offer forms of therapy; a relief from anxieties to which only bad philosophical habits have made us subject. But my concern in what follows is that this amounts to a kind of denial of a historicity of depth and consequence. The effect, I will argue, is that history itself is emptied out to a point where in effect it is recreated with each re-description. This symptom itself highlights faults held in common by both the longer-standing positivist position on historiography and its now-influential postmodernist counterpart. Indeed, in terms of the ethics of our relation to history, the former position is in fact much more proximate to the latter than either side might feel comfortable acknowledging. For in common, positivist, pragmatist and postmodernist treatments of historiography deny the possibility of an adequate distinction between description and misde- scription, if the latter is the possibility that we might misremember, mystify, be wrong about, and so ideologically manipulate the past for politically questionable purposes.5 Positivism sets the bar for ade- quate description impossibly high; postmodernism denies altogether the scope for a substantial meaning of the term. And if misdescription is impossible, then clearly the charge of deliberate misdescription will itself be without substance. And when we reach this stage, the scope for conceptualizing our relationship with the past becomes impover- ished, and the relationship deprived of depth and nuance - in short, of its very historicity. Historiography becomes a sort of authorial con- juring, in which, as Bryan Palmer puts it, 'the past can only be created out of the imperatives of the ongoing instance'.6 The result is that we are severed from a responsibility to the past, from its materiality, and from the (constrained) range of possibilities which it bequeaths. In what follows, I argue this case through a series of stages. Firstly, I outline relevant aspects of Rorty's distinctive 'take' on the problems of the philosophical tradition, and the ways in which we might set these aside. I argue that in fact, Rorty's position is trickier to distin- guish from linguistic idealism than he himself makes out, and is also vulnerable to criticisms of positivism made by Horkheimer. I then consider Jenkins's avowedly postmodernist approach as a kind of extension of elements of Rorty's case, and argue that it too amounts to a kind of linguistic idealism. That neither approach offers adequate critical purchase on the pressing ethical questions posed by the delib- erate misdescription of the past, I hope to show by considering the implications of recent attempts at Holocaust denial.</page><page sequence="3">84 Gideon Calder Historicity, Pragmatism and Redescription It is often taken as evidence of a distinctively 'postmodern' condition that contemporary experience has, as Fredric Jameson has put it, lost touch with the separateness (or 'specificity') of historical reality, so that the past has been collapsed into a depthless 'eternal present'. Jameson calls this 'the waning of our history, of our lived possibility of experiencing history in some active way'. He diagnoses 'a crisis of historicity', in which 'we are condemned to seek History by way of our own pop images and simulacra of that history, which itself remains forever out of reach'.7 Thus, there is no gap between res ges- tae and res gestorům : 'the way things happened' on the one hand and their appearance in memory, cultural representation, or political uti- lization on the other. In echo to this analysis, Peter Novick has suggested that what is lost in this kind of process is the historicity of history, and its dis- placement by memory: Historical consciousness, by its nature, focuses on the historicity of events - that they took place then and not now, that they grew out of circum- stances different from those that now obtain. Memory, by contrast, has no sense of the passage of time; it denies the 'pastness' of its objects and insists on their continuing presence.8 With the collapse of this gap, the past becomes freely malleable, neu- tralized, a tool or prop, being purely the effect of present priorities. Our relationship to it thus becomes depoliticized, and frictionless, except in terms of the costs our orientations may incur in terms of our acceptability to our peers. As a corollary, history and the national past become items for consumption. The burgeoning 'heritage' industry lets us nostalgically shop around for the solidities of communal ways of living, of shared meanings and identities, which have passed and become fragmented.9 Again, the past appears not as any kind of 'real- ity', but as the convenient construction of present economic, cultural or political concerns. I present this picture in order to set alongside it Rorty's claim - in Contingency ; Irony ; and Solidarity - that 'anything can be made to look good or bad, important or unimportant, useful or useless, by being re-described'. 10 The upshot of this claim is, for historians, often assumed to be liberatory and progressive: to furnish endless possibil- ities for the re-description of the past and its implications, where</page><page sequence="4">Postmodernism, Pragmatism, and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past 85 previously there were the fixed, monolithic authorities of the histori- ographical tradition. I dispute this assumption. My basic case in what follows is that, by reducing history in principle to an eternal present, Rorty's historicism acquiesces in the ideological constructions referred to above. It makes too easy the possibility of 'doing justice' to - or learning lessons from - the past, precisely because it denies the independence of a reality beyond the present. It offers no critical help to any putative collective effort to sustain, or keep present, aspects of the past which would otherwise wane with the passing of time, become refashioned or forgotten - 'overpowered' and 'irre- trievable', in Benjamin's phrasing. My diagnosis here will not depart significantly from Rorty's own conception of the possibilities afforded by his work. As a pragmatist, he readily embraces the collapse of truth into what succeeds in being asserted, and takes it as a call to bolster our practices against tomor- row's always-possible advent of fascism.11 This is because he sees no sense in describing truth as possessing any kind of causal power, or as an explanatory resource: both social and intellectual progress, for Rorty, stem from the trying out of alternative imaginative descriptions and re-descriptions of past, present and future horizons. Thus change arises from the adoption of novel, appealing, practically efficacious vocabularies. And this, at its best, is what inquiry does. 12 In a resonant metaphor, Rorty argues that rather than proceeding 'vertically' from first principles or brute reality, inquiry moves 'horizontally' from one description, or interpretation, to another. It is thus thoroughly self-ref- erential: the world of our social practices - and indeed the 'inner world' of relations to ourselves - is a mesh of descriptions, the best of which provide the vehicle for fruitful change. The world beyond those descriptions is (as it were) mute: as Rorty memorably puts it, it does not speak; only we do. Our relations with our environment are down to the way it has been described, rather than the way it is 'in itself'. Rorty himself does not directly focus on my concern here with the relation of present agents to the events - rather than the philoso- phers - of the past. But discussing that relationship, he concludes that, 'We need to tell ourselves stories of the mighty dead in order to make our hopes of surpassing them concrete. ... we have to have both imaginary conversations with the dead and the conviction that we have seen further than they. That means that we need Geistes- geschichte, self-congratulatory conversations.' Moreover, 'honesty . . . consists in keeping in mind the possibility that our self-justifying conversation is with creatures of our own fantasy rather than with</page><page sequence="5">86 Gideon Calder historical personages'.13 This, I think, is a neat summary of the sense of historiography's scope that emerges from Rorty's work as a whole: it is a matter of making (through 'fantasy', or just re-description) rather than finding , or discovering, antecedently existent phenomena. This reading of him takes some defending, given that Rorty him- self rejects the very distinction between realism and anti-realism upon which a customary distinction between 'finding' and 'making' might depend. He suggests that it would be best to 'think of objectivity as a matter of ability to achieve agreement on whether a particular set of desiderata has or has not been satisfied', and to 'redefine "reality" as what the winners of the game talk about'.14 Thus the process of hori- zontal reinterpretation, reassessment and re-description is not endless, in so far as it is brought to a halt, and constrained, by practice. It is what is asserted, taken up, used, and so becomes sedimented and 'nor- mal' which wins out. Thus, as he notes in a very early article: For Peirce there is potentially a sign behind every sign, and for Wittgen- stein there is potentially a language game behind every language game; but both consider these regresses harmless on the pragmatic ground that practice does not require the actualisation of these potentialities.15 It is assertion, rather than validity, which dictates the terms. In prov- ing useful for a purpose, a description becomes right. Given that the contestation of descriptions takes place not by (vertical) reference to reality, but exclusively by (horizontal) relation to other descriptions, truth thus becomes reduced to a convention. It is pointless, says Rorty, to ask 'whether there really are mountains or whether it is merely convenient for us to talk about mountains'.16 There is no such thing as an 'intrinsic' quality which our descriptions might either succeed in grasping, or fail to. Any inquiry depends on mountains being under a description. Describing something is a matter of relating it to other things. We have no choice about this feature of description, although we do have a choice about the descriptions we use. For Rorty our descriptions are not constrained by 'the truth', then, except in the sense that they are constrained by the norms and prac- tices of the community in which we happen to be operating - by the sorts of descriptions to which our new descriptions will be relative. But this does not mean, Rorty claims, that we simply describe things however we like in a world of our own making. That would imply that language is arbitrary. But the linguistic tools we use are not random, nor the product of rudderless invention:</page><page sequence="6">Postmodernism, Pragmatism, and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past 87 Nor do I think that language is 'an arbitrary system of signs', any more than that the constellations are arbitrary arrangements of stars. Given the conditions we live in, they are among the arrangements of stars that it is useful for us to talk about. More generally, given the conditions we live in, the language we use is the obvious way for us to talk. There may be better ways, but they will not be analyzing the 'conditions of possi- bility' of present ways . . . They will be discovered by somebody propos- ing a new idiom, its being tried out, and its being found to work better than its predecessor.17 This, for Rorty, is a defence against the charge of linguistic ideal- ism - the position that the world is created through language. Any such case, he argues, must rest on that scheme/content distinction which would present 'our descriptions' and 'the world' such that the first, when 'true', accurately 'represent' the 'reality' of the latter. And this, as a pragmatist, is precisely the kind of Plato-style distinction between appearance and reality which Rorty finds it urgent that we set aside. As he puts it: 'there is no relation of "closeness of fit" between language and the world: no image of the world projected by language is more or less representative of the way the world really is than any other'.18 In rejecting such distinctions, Rorty talks as if both sides are equally unhelpful, and misconceived. As I read him, however, he does not dispose of these distinctions, but rather lops off one half. This is particularly pointed in the case of the relation between descriptions and the world. As Frank Farrell points out, once Rorty has removed the half of the positivist picture which requires that the world provides us with an empirical given, he retains the other half: that we then 'add schemes of linguistic ordering that process the data so as to yield cor- rect predictions about future experiences'.19 Conceiving 'prediction' in terms of 'enabling us to cope', the second half remains intact. So, as Farrell puts it: 'We have the construction of ways of talking that help us to manage but nothing is given to such ways of talking, from the direction of the world, that constrains how they are to develop.' Thus: 'the world . . . falls into insignificance in favour of the vocabu- laries themselves'.20 And this amounts, pragmatically, to a form of linguistic idealism, in so far as there is nothing beyond our vocabu- laries which might resist or constrain our re-description of the world, its events, and our relations to them. Hence, if we're 'honest', we recognise that as we seek reassurance that our practices are justifiable, our conversation is with the created, rather than the found. This is not a theme which Rorty himself extends in the direction of an ethical</page><page sequence="7">88 Gideon Calder relation with the past. It has, though, been echoed in a notable recent attempt to deal with just that relation. The past as tabula rasa Keith Jenkins's work provides extensive variations on a familiar enough sort of theme: that, as E.H. Carr once put it, 'the facts of his- tory never come to us "pure", since they do not and cannot exist in a pure form: they are always refracted through the mind of the recorder'.21 Like Rorty, Jenkins talks in terms of language (or, more generally, discursive practices) rather than the mind as history's fil- ter, taking narrative as his basic epistemological medium. His point, though, chimes with Carr's: there is no unmediated access to the events of the past. But while Carr's point might seem self-evident, Jenkins's own formulations do not. In fact, like Rorty, he takes the point further, echoing the reminder that 'the world does not speak - only we do', and building from it a straightforwardly linguistic-ide- alist account of historiography. As with Rorty 's denial that there is a 'language' that is 'nature's own', the case rests on denial of an extravagant anthropomorphism: the past is presented like a mute interlocutor, such [t]hat in and of itself the past contains nothing of obvious significance. That left on its own it has no discoverable point. That it expresses no intelligible rhyme or reason. That it consists of nothing independent of us that we have to be loyal to, nothing we have to feel guilty about, no facts we have to find, no truths we have to respect, no problems we have to solve, no project we have to complete. It is clear that the past doesn't exist 'historically' outside of historians' textual, constructive appropria- tions, so that, being made by them, it has no independence to resist their interpretative will, not least at the level of meaning. . . . Consequently, the past as history always has been and always will be necessarily config- ured, troped, emplotted, read, mythologized and ideologized in ways to suit ourselves.22 This seems a cogent, forthright articulation of the position which emerges from Rorty 's account of our understanding always being 'under an optional description'. Jenkins argues that Rorty 's claim that 'anything can be made to look good or bad by being re-described', once swallowed, induces the stark realization that 'shorn of meta- physical foundations, of non-terrestrial sky-hooks, we are now left</page><page sequence="8">Postmodernism, Pragmatism, and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past 89 with a world where there is "nothing but history" (contingency), and where the "past" we are left with - and the "history" that we use to try and make sense of what we are left with - are both interminably re- describable'.23 And, extending the point: 'As soon as you think about it, the idea of a historicized past existing independently of our vari- ously present-day constitutive concerns, is an absurd one'.24 This is Novick's more wistful cultural observation made into a point of onto- logical principle: there is no longer any distinction to be had between 'historicity' and 'collective memory'. For Jenkins, 'history' is, a pri- ori ', the product of historians who themselves are simply a product of their present. But like Carr's point, much of Jenkins's case here may not, in itself, transcend the stating of the obvious. This is partly down to its rhetor- ical construction. As with Rorty's 'the world does not speak', the onus does seem to be on Jenkins to produce an example of a theorist of his- tory arguing, unsarcastically, that left on its own (without humans? without language?) the past would have a single, discoverable point. To use this model as a foil is to suggest that to believe in any sort of objectivity one has to insist that history is the subjectless revelation of packaged-up truth, delivered on request to the doorstep of appropri- ately diligent historians and uncontaminated by any interpretive input of their own. It is, in other words, to imply that to be 'real' history must be a sort of non-human agency itself - something, perhaps, like God - which gives us its details directly and unmediated. Much, then, hangs on the function of those 'have s' in the longer passage from Jenkins quoted above, in as much as they caricature a position which nobody would seriously defend in order to validate an opposite conclusion presented as the only sane alternative. As such, as is familiar enough from Rorty's own equivalent constructions, they set up a false dichotomy. Of course, we do not literally have to talk about the past in any particular way, as if it might interrupt and start haranguing us if we misdescribe it, or are disloyal to it, or just ignore what happened in it. To claim as much would be a bit like saying that we literally have to call tables 'tables' or else they'll complain: an ultra-naive version of what philosophers call 'naive realism'. Jenkins, anyway, suggests that the vanquishing of naive realism leaves no alternative but to conclude that history is only our descriptions of it: Having no meaning-full existence independent of historians' textual em- brace, being constructed by them, the past constituted as historicized text has ultimately no choice but to go along with whatever purposes are desired.25</page><page sequence="9">90 Gideon Calder Because history exists for us in so far as it is a textual creation, then, it has no choice but to bend itself to current social purposes. It has no choice because it cannot speak without us. What Jenkins collapses here is a gap which very few people would have seriously claimed existed in the first place: that between the past as an independently-existing entity with its own agency and motives, whose feelings we can literally hurt (a past which, as Rorty might put it, 'speaks') and on the other hand the texts through which we gain access to that past. For Jenkins, this distinction is unsustainable. Hence, all we have are texts. Hence, 'the goal of "learning lessons from the past" is actually learning lessons from stories written by his- torians and others'. And so the question arises: 'If the past as history has no foundation, can anything ethical be gained from its study?'26 And the answers follow: that 'we can now "forget history" for post- modern imaginaries sans histoire '; that 'history per se ... just slip- ping out of conversations' is 'a good thing' ; that we should now 'embrace a non-historicizing postmodernism'.27 Jenkins's cashing-out of the common denominators of the prag- matist/post-structuralist line on the impossibility of historical knowl- edge is - for all its studied flippancy - faithful and instructive. It seems very difficult, once history has been 'horizontalized' and so reduced to conversation, to find a sense in which historical descrip- tions might be about anything besides other historical descriptions. Thus dealings with 'the past' present a prime example of exactly why there is no extra-discursive reality to speak of (after all, in speaking of it, we have made it text). The force of the case lies largely in its high- lighting of an unremarkable feature of the practice of 'doing history'. We do not survey the past directly, with a somehow passive eye, but rather reconstruct it according to 'evidence' (texts, bones, ruins, or whatever - things which otherwise might seem to have differing onto- logical status, but are here reduced to a par) our interpretations of which will always be theory-laden. Thus, historiographically speak- ing, language really does go all the way down: the past, mediated to us and received in the present, cannot be viewed except from within, and through, the present's contingent, linguistically constituted, hori- zons of interpretation. And so far, on its own terms, the case seems unrebuttable. But the idea that it somehow spells doom, as Jenkins suggests, for the very idea of the past's existence beyond our current descriptions of it owes its credibility, I think, to another, uncollapsed gap. It emerges in the stubborn, positivistic hunch that there must be an absolute breach</page><page sequence="10">Postmodernism, Pragmatism, and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past 9 1 between 'what happened' and 'how it is remembered', or between our relationship to history and the circumstances in which we forge it. This is the hunch that, to be 'really' about the past, history has to be written as if the present did not exist, and the assumption that the impossibility of this kind of 'God's-eye' perspective cuts us free from any meaningful burden of veracity. Positivists talk as if such a value- neutral perspective is available;28 postmodernists deny that it is. For Jenkins, recognition that 'when we talk about facts we always do so under a description'29 marks a chasm between empiricist and post- modernist views of history: the one proposing that truths link ideas with realities, and the other responding, with Rorty, that interpreta- tions refer only to other interpretations. But in fact, pace Jenkins, a common thread links the two positions. Basically it is this: that 'real' history depends upon prejudice-free, judgement- free, value-neutral, scientistic inquiry. For the stereotyped positivist, this means that cultural values should be excluded from the proceedings. For Jenkins, the impossibility of history-as-science means that cultural values are all we are left with: 'facts' dissolve into the contingent descriptions by which their status is secured. But for both, facts and values belong to different realms. The parallel can be put in another way. For both positions there is a fundamental rupture between language and historiographical prac- tice on the one hand, and the world on the other: a rupture which is breached in both cases by the projection of a conceptual scheme in order to absorb the independence of historicity into what can affirmed about it in discourse. One commentator characterizes Rorty's project as 'thin description'; it would seem more accurate to describe it as involving the thickening of description and the thinning out of the world.30 Jenkins makes a quasi-Sartrean appeal to the sheer sense- lessness of the world relative to the individual knower, prior to the projection of discourse upon it and its incorporation into the horizon- tal to-ings and fro-ings of description. As E.R Thompson once remarked about Althusser, the result is 'exactly what has commonly been designated, in the Marxist tradition, as idealism' - that is, 'a self-generating conceptual universe which imposes its own identity upon the phenomena of material and social existence, rather than engaging in continual dialogue with them'.31 The result, when it comes to the writing of history, is a sort of extreme Romanticism: the narrator is secured at the centre of the uni- verse, unconstrained by materiality, constrained only by his/her own sensitivities to the audience for which he/she writes.32 Jenkins's view</page><page sequence="11">92 Gideon Calder is that truth is essentially and exclusively the effect of narrativity, and that to think otherwise is to presume that the facts in any given case can simply be read off from the documents, or established without recourse to interpretive frameworks of any kind.33 But this presumes that there are cultural constructions on the one hand (like language, values, The Fall of the Roman Empire , news reports, commemorative exhibitions, etc) and the (for Jenkins, unattainable) brute reality of events on the other. As he says: 'the past . . . did occur, and in exactly the way it did'. Quite how he can claim knowledge of this is intrigu- ing, since he insists that the past's meaning (and its existence for us) depends on our free, unconstrained descriptions of it. 'The past occurred in exactly the way it did' represents just one among an unre- stricted range of such descriptions. There is the elusive 'real' on the one hand, and contingent cultural constructions on the other. Because the first is prohibitively elusive, the second are all we have. 'History' as we relate to it is a contingent creation of our own. Hence it is not something to which we can have any real sort of ethical relationship. Again, this seems a faithful historiographical rendering of Rorty's position on the role of the object which, while it exists prior to being described, thenceforth exists only under a contingent description. With respect to history, the implications become especially pro- nounced. 'Historiography' can exist only as a misnomer, since there is no ontological gap between past and present for it to bridge: given that history only exists in terms of our present experience of it, its pastness can only ever be ineffable. Hence, we are stuck in an eternal present, in which the horizontal workings of discourse conduct themselves unconstrained by any emergent properties of the past itself. As Berke- ley had it: an idea can relate only to another idea. Making Space for Misdescription One might conceive of the severing of all ontological ties when it comes to writing or representing history as an ethical gesture. It promises liberation, for some, from the overweening intrusions of sci- entists thinking (and the vocabulary of 'truth', 'objectivity' and all the rest) into areas where it has overweeningly intruded too long. One might (with Rorty) insist that, in the process, our proper relationship to history becomes a matter of our proper relationship to each other, rather than to a spurious 'objectivity' to which our representations can never, in any case, be fully adequate. After all, mainstream philosophy</page><page sequence="12">Postmodernism, Pragmatism, and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past 93 of history has acknowledged more and more, before and since Carr, that historiography reflects the priorities of the present rather than some pre-given, in-built historical script. History doesn't write itself. We write it - and it's only within our present horizons that those writ- ings (now, with Jenkins, lacking a referent beyond the present) can be challenged and held to account. Our relationship to history is thus open, always re-creatable, and unconstrained by that spurious con- coction 'the past itself'. But to draw these conclusions as if they amounted to the end of the story (and indeed, as Jenkins would have it, the end of 'history') is, as I have argued, to swallow whole an inheritance of assumptions from positivist historiography about the relation between fact and value. These assumptions, in fact, sit very uneasily with any assumption that there might be something intrinsically ethical/political about our rela- tionship to the actions and events of the past. To state the obvious, the existence of that 'something' depends on there being such a relation- ship: that the past is not simply reducible to its presence in current conversation. We need not agree on the nature of this 'something' in order to agree that a viable idea of misdescription depends on it. Both views conclude that the past can be levelled down to a series of statements about it: for positivism, statements of verified and so incontrovertible fact, and for post-modernism, descriptive statements epistemologically on a par with each other and so as right as it's pos- sible to be.34 For post-structuralism especially, the very idea of history becomes a piece of illegitimate metaphysics: a totalization whose logic, when enacted, has for Lyotard produced the most extreme atrocities of the modern age. My point is that, while positivism allows for the possibility of misdescription, it condemns us to a situation in which it's inevitable: nothing could tell us when we had finally arrived at the complete mapping of a given series of events. Meanwhile, Jenk- ins's position makes it impossible , precisely because there is ulti- mately no discrepancy between text and world: texts are strictly all we have, in principle, a priori. This is, of course, a metaphysical claim. On its basis, the very idea of doing justice, or injustice, to the past becomes simply a piece of circular self-deceit. We can draw out the implications of the Jenkins/Rorty stance by way of Rorty's reading, in Contingency ; Irony, and Solidarity , of the 'ironist' O'Brien in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell takes O'Brien's arguments in 'breaking' Winston Smith towards the end of the novel as demonstrating a point similar to that which he himself makes in quoting Sartre to the effect that nothing about</page><page sequence="13">94 Gideon Calder 'human nature', or history, or truth, would prevent fascism, tomorrow, becoming 'the truth of man'.35 Rorty's point is that O'Brien is aware that the past, like reality, is infinitely malleable: that nothing, of necessity, resists redescription. Take the following passage, cited by James Conant as 'an argumentative gambit strikingly reminiscent of some of Rorty's own tactics':36 O'Brien smiled faintly. 'You are no metaphysician, Winston,' he said. 'Until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. I will put it more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in space? Is there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is still happening?' 'No.' 'Then where does the past exist, if at all?' 'In records. It is written down.' 'In records. And ...?' 'In the mind. In human memories.' 'In the memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and we control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?'37 As I see it, O'Brien's manoeuvring here parallels Rorty's own. The idea that the past ('the world') is a place ('speaks') as if a separate empirical entity is dispatched in favour of an option presented as the only alternative: that the past is exhaustively controlled by our redescription of it. Because there is no past-as-entity against which we can hold up our present descriptions by way of comparison, there is no past understood as extricable from our present practices. As Conant himself suggests, in reconstructing an O'Brien-esque slant on history, 'the "truth" about the past is simply a matter of how the community's memories and records as a whole cohere and has nothing to do with how well those memories and records "represent the facts". To seek an answer to the question, "What happened at such-and-such a point in the past?" is to seek a consensus with one's peers.'38 The 'true' story will be the one which prevails as a result of that conversation. The inadequacies of such a conclusion emerge, I think, when we consider a situation (hardly far-fetched) wherein at stake in that con- versation is a dispute between participants that depends for its reso- lution on what actually happened in the past. An example of this would be the issue of Holocaust denial, which figures in Lyotard's</page><page sequence="14">Postmodernism, Pragmatism, and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past 95 work as an example of the problems of historiography. In exploring the ramifications, it is worth looking at particular issues in the course of a particular conversation: the recent High Court libel suit brought by David Irving against a writer who had described him as a Holo- caust denier.39 Irving, an expert Hitler scholar, has made, in a series of books since the 1960s, three main claims against customary assump- tions about the scale of the Holocaust and its execution: (i) that there was in fact no systematic Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews; (ii) that there is no proof that Hitler ordered a policy of extermination; and (iii) that no Jews were killed in gas chambers at Auschwitz. The defence's case against Irving consisted of a reiteration of the claim (made in the work the author of which he was suing 'for the sake of his reputation') that he is a 'liar', a Holocaust denier, and that his work as a historian has been warped by his politics. I won't go into the details of the case or of the judgement here. I just want - at the risk of tokenizing it - to situate it vis-à-vis what we might now call the Rorty/Jenkins/O'Brien position. As emerged in the trial, and is anyway public enough knowledge (advertised, for instance, on his own website), Irving has for years offered $ 1 000 to anyone who can produce a document demonstrating that Hitler ordered the Holocaust - in other words, that it was planned at the highest levels of the Reich, and not merely the result of the spo- radic and coincidental actions of the more bloodthirsty among the lower ranks of the SS. Nobody has. Irving's tack throughout the trial, and in his rhetoric through the years, has tended to base itself on a seemingly commonsense, but more likely expediently literalist, appeal to the basic requirement of documentary evidence as verifica- tion of every historical claim. This is a standard ploy amongst Holocaust deniers: to ask for evi- dence they assume to be unattainable as the only possible justification of the claim that certain core features of conventional accounts of the Holocaust existed. Take, for instance, Faurisson's claim that there is insufficient evidence that gas chambers existed at Auschwitz. 'I have tried in vain,' claims Faurisson, 'to find a single former deportee capable of proving to me that he had really seen, with his own eyes, a gas chamber.'40 Faurisson's basic (and needless to say, cynical) point is that the only acceptable proof that a gas chamber existed and was used to kill people would be that one had seen it kill people. Therefore the only eyewitness he will accept would be a victim of the gas cham- ber. Now gas chambers were such that no victims survived. Therefore, there were no 'gas chambers' in the sense in which conventional his-</page><page sequence="15">96 Gideon Calder tory maintains: their existence as such could only be proved by the coming forward of a survivor as eyewitness, and that would disprove the claim that the gas chambers were what we assumed them to be. This equates, Lyotard observes, to the impossibility of answering the challenge from a book publisher to name 'a work of major impor- tance which would have been rejected by every editor and which therefore remains unknown'.41 You can't. If you could, it would be because it had been published, a precondition for attaining 'major importance'. So the publisher is right. Much the same reductive strat- egy as Faurisson's operates in Irving's challenge to produce evidence of Hitler's complicity in the Final Solution.42 It's a sort of strategic positivism: a demand for directly verifiable, physical evidence which is known in advance to be unforthcoming, or unobtainable. But it is only the nature of the question posed which makes an affirmative answer impossible to provide. In the case of the Final Solution, as everywhere, this approach conveniently misses the point, asking for isolated, atomised facts in isolation from the wider context which would make those facts interpretable in the first place. In this instance, the plans for the Final Solution, rather than existing in the form of a single, comprehensive edict, are widely acknowledged to have evolved over time - as indeed has the body of historical evi- dence which gives rise to that acknowledgement. Such is historio- graphie practice: ongoing and relating to events and processes which themselves were neither static nor atomized. Still, Irving's strategy throughout the court case was consistently in line with the ultra-positivist approach: constantly asking for pin- pointed written evidence of orders, and so on.43 Among other things, what is operating in this technique is a simple collapse of ontology into epistemology: of what is (or was) into what can be known, or more accurately what is known, or textually extant. (The same logic collapses historicity into collective memory, to use Novick's terms, and intellectualizes the collapse of historical specificity into an eter- nal present, to use Jameson's). To return to Carr's point, it's like deriv- ing from the premise that 'the facts of history never come to us "pure", since they ... are always refracted through the mind of the recorder' the conclusion that 'minds' are all that we can be sure exists. And yet this is exactly the move made in the setting-up of the Rorty/Jenkins/O'Brien position. All three take as final the crude posi- tivistic challenge ('Show me this place called "the past" which exists concretely, in space') and, in the face of it, back away into a position of chastened refusal: the past, insofar as it exists, is what we say it is. On</page><page sequence="16">Postmodernism, Pragmatism , and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past 97 these terms, as O'Brien rightly concludes, the Party wins because it holds the tools of re-description and the power to assert its version of events. Beyond that version lies - in practice - ineffability. With his- tory looked at this way, even without Oceania, descriptions of the past can only be wrong in relation to other, competing, perhaps sedimented and so authoritative, accounts of the past. In effect, this is to collapse the past into a present which becomes everything, the sole existent. But a deeper notion of misdescription than simply 'versions of the past alternative to those to which we customarily cleave' is required for the punishment of Irving to be anything more than a flexing of ideological muscle, or a vanquishing of the sort of marginal, minority views which Lyotard finds everywhere to be suppressed by the logic of proof. The anti-realist case that history exists solely in our descriptions of it, with only ineffable unverifiability beyond, relies (as Rorty would concur) on the logic of O'Brien. The obvious rejoinder here is that, as Chris Lorenz has put it, 'the mere fact that the past is only known by us through . . . description . . . does not entail the conclusion that the past is a description or can be regarded as such'.44 Reduction of the past to present descriptions of it, or to put it Novick-style, the empty- ing out of the historicity of past events, removes the possibility of cul- pability for misrepresentation. It exonerates David Irving from the charge of denial, whatever he says and whatever happened in the past. A meaningful charge of misdescription requires that right description is at least a term of which we can make sense. 'Metaphysics may be a mug's game,' as Berel Lang has written, 'but those who think they can avoid it by burying their heads in the sand are likely to wind up playing the game anyway but from the other end'.45 In the Rorty/Jenkins/O'Brien case, this 'backwards' metaphysics results in a false dichotomy. Either one must hold that historical events are merely a fictive effect of the narratives with which we recount them, or one must hold that to be worthy of the name, historiography must give us the facts on their own terms, and (as if no human agency were involved) let the past articulate itself. As I've argued here, any credibility that the former claim has is directly proportionate to the extent to which one takes the second claim seriously. Concluding Note What does this matter? Part of the point in exploring these issues has been that here, for one reason and another, we find a point at which</page><page sequence="17">98 Gideon Calder the flourishes of recent theory come right up against the concrete dimensions of our lived experience, and its social reception. The trou- ble with much of recent theory has been that it formalises and neu- tralises a relationship which, to be borne out in its full significances, needs to remain thick, adhesive and messy. The relationship in ques- tion is that between the political and cultural priorities of the present, and the 'traces of events' of which Ricoeur proposes that we have a duty to tell. Ricoeur's point, and the very idea of an ethics of remem- brance, or 'doing justice' to the past, have complex depths beyond the scope of our discussion here. But I hope to have shown, in a piece- meal way, that the dissolution of the past into the discursive denies the space in which we might appreciate it in its singularity - whether this be a matter of wonder, of horror, or of a more mundane working- through of our relations to it.

In what follows I use 'positivism' in a rather loose sense, defined by a rigid split between fact and value. I'm aware that this rather thin account will not do justice to the particularity of different orientations - Comte 's, Ranke's, or A. J. Ayer's - which have laid claim to the term. Still, it features here as a sort of caricature of certain assumptions from which pragmatists and postmodernists would want to distance themselves, in order to show that, in some respects, the distance isn't all that great. The prima facie mistaken claim that fact-obsessed positivists deny that we can misdescribe will be explained as we go on.</page><page sequence="18">Postmodernism, Pragmatism, and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past 99 6.

This does, to be sure, suggest a more Rortian view of the subject - as creative redescriber, and meaning creator - than a strictly post-structuralist one, in which the speaking subject is not, in any sure sense, mistress of the language she utilizes. 33. See Christopher Norris, 4 Postmodernising History: Right-Wing Revisionism and the Uses of Theory', Southern Review , 21, 1988, pp. 128-9. Norris separates the valuable lessons that theorists like Hayden White, Foucault and indeed Barthes can teach historians about the need for contextual sensitivity, for careful and crit- ically aware reading, from, on the other hand, the tendency to 'go the whole scep- tical hog' vis-à-vis the possibility of historiography and so render those lessons pretty much pointless. 34. At this point a distinction between forms of positivism is important. For while 19th century positivist historians like Ranke were happy to talk of, and to prize, historical 'facts' as radically separate from cultural values, logical positivists such as Ayer were (with good reason, by their own lights) pretty sceptical about the 'reality' of the past for reasons parallel to the postmodernist case - that is to say, the absence of a readily available sense of 'verification' by which we might prove the past's reality. 35.

Conant is rightly perplexed by Rorty's own, strangely skewed, take on the Winston Smith/O'Brien encounter in Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity , in which O'Brien is presented as speaking, for Orwell, on the malleability of truth, while Winston's torture is taken as a prime example of the humiliation to which we are all, as human beings, potentially subject. 37.

In January 2000 the historian David Irving brought a libel action in London against the American academic Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books, author and publisher respectively of Denying the Holocaust : The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory , a book which described Irving as an ideologically motivated Hitler apologist set on misrepresentation of data and documents, and as 'one of the most dangerous Holocaust deniers'. On April 1 1, the High Court judge, Mr Jus- tice Gray, found in favour of the defendants. He declared Irving - in the course of over 30 years as a Hitler scholar - to have 'portrayed Hitler in an unwarrant- edly favourable light, principally in relation to his attitude towards and responsi- bility for the treatment of Jews', and to be 'an active Holocaust denier' (Glasgow Herald, 12 April 2000, p.3).</page><page sequence="20">Postmodernism , Pragmatism, and the Possibility of an Ethical Relation to the Past 101 40.

The difference between them being that in Faurisson 's, and the 'book publisher' example, there could not conceivably be proof, whereas the question whether Hitler issued a particular order is potentially answerable, whatever the current state of evidence on the matter. But as I say here, the form of evidence demanded is what links all three. 43. Anyone who, for instance, will not allow that the Nazi hierarchy, aware enough of the significance of their actions, might have deliberately avoided putting every last order in writing, will have problems relating any events not in directly observable causal relation. 44.
