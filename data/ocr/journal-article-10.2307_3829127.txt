I said 'Vernon Lee?' -Robert Browning, "Inapprehensiveness" (2: 886-87) AUTUMN 1998/1999</page><page sequence="2">HILARY FRASER R obert Browning's poem "Inapprehensiveness" (1889) neatly ex- emplifies both the new interest in specularity and the observing subject in the nineteenth century, and the different, indeed competing, viewing positions of masculinity and femininity within the modern ocular field.' The poem begins with the male speaker and his female companion standing "simply friend-like side by side / Viewing a twilight country" in an apparently shared gaze, but the woman "[breaks] silence," asserting her desire to control the field of vision, wishing she had her perspective glass. Such optical devices are, asJonathan Crary reminds us, "sites of both knowledge and power that operate directly on the body of the individual" (7),2 and the perspective glass here signifies the woman's wish to define and control her position vis-a-vis not only the view but also her companion. Meanwhile the "unnoticed" man by her side, desperate for her "regard," "needing but a look," wills her to break her "inapprehensive stare," silently imploring her, "let your eyes meet mine." But the woman continues actively to look, taking pleasure in her gaze, insisting upon her role as observer, and utterly confounding the specular status her companion wishes to confer upon her by refusing to be the willing object of his fantasizing and coercive gaze. The view reminds her of something she has read--"not," she thinks, "by Ruskin"-in response to which the male speaker ironically offers at the end of the poem the suggestion that the name she is searching for is perhaps Vernon Lee (its placement as the poem's final words gives it particular weight). The invocation of first the eminent art critic John Ruskin and then Vernon Lee, an art historian and aesthetician also of some repute in her own day, allows us to locate the poem within the larger frame of the sexual politics of spectatorship. It is with Vernon Lee that the disgruntled male speaker aligns his female companion, not Ruskin-with the woman, that is, who asserted the significance of the "real setting of place and moment, and individuality and digression" (Lee, Belcaro 7) in her aesthetic, rather than with Ruskin, whom she characterized as "this strange knight-errant of righteousness" (Belcaro 203). Although recent scholarship in the area of "vision and difference" has problematized monolithic constructions of the female gaze, the ques- tion of feminine spectatorship, understood as encompassing a diversity of viewing positions, remains an important, if relatively unexplored, aspect of the history of vision in the nineteenth century.3 The submerged history of women's discourse on art offers a particularly compelling instance of Deborah Cherry's observation that "feminine spectators have remained VICTORIAN STUDIES 78</page><page sequence="3">WOMEN AND THE ENDS OF ART HISTORY beneath the surface of historical discourse" (116).4 My intention in this essay is to reread some examples of women's art historical writing of the last century in the light of recent research in the area of vision and visuality, following Crary's important book on vision and modernity in the nine- teenth century, Techniques of the Observer (1990), and, in particular, to reflect on questions of gender that Crary fails to address. Concerned with the "historical construction" of vision (1), Crary argues that, alongside devel- opments in physiological optics and optical technology, "a new kind of observer took shape in Europe" in the early decades of the nineteenth century (6), one that displaced the disembodied visual experience of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, defined by the incorporeal relations of the camera obscura, with an emphatically corporeal visual subject. And yet Crary's "dominant model of what an observer was in the nineteenth century" (7) is itself oddly disembodied. As W.J. T. Mitchell has pointed out, Crary "shows no interest in the empirical history of spectatorship, in the study of visuality as a cultural practice of everyday life, or in the observer/spectator's body as marked by gender, class, or ethnicity" (20). Most important for what follows, Crary ignores the problematics of female spectatorship that have so exercised feminist theorists, particularly of film, over the past two decades.5 And yet, given her status as spectacle, and the identification of the agency of the gaze with male subjectivity, a woman faced particular difficulties in claiming the authority of vision and inter- pretation in the nineteenth century (see Nord 4, 11-12). What I wish to argue is that women art historians in the nine- teenth century participated vigorously and variously in the epistemic shift identified by Crary, and, further, that their experience as observers was inflected by gender in ways that mark them out from Crary's homoge- neous "dominant model." In exploring this last point, I will focus my attention on Vernon Lee, not only because, of all the writers under consideration, she most fully exemplifies Crary's figure of the modern corporeal observer, but because of her evident interest, articulated most notably in her novel Miss Brown (1884), in the gender of the look. Her art historical writing does not explicitly invoke the sexed body, but the very absence of gender in a discourse so insistently predicated on embod- iment is arguably symptomatic of her ideological positioning, and of the contemporary art historical and physiological rhetoric available to her. Moreover, her critical engagement with Ruskin, against whose influential aesthetic her own visual theory and practice are so consciously defined, invites a gendered reading. Her reinstatement of a feminine language of AUTUMN 1998/1999 79</page><page sequence="4">HILARY FRASER "empathy" can, I suggest, be read as a riposte to Ruskin's famous con- demnation of a feminized "pathetic fallacy" (Ruskin 5: 201-20). Further- more, she actively critiques masculinist conventions of visual knowing dependent on "machinery" and abstract systems that replace the experi- ence of art with "foreign, extra-artistic, irrelevant interests" (Belcaro 12), including Ruskin's moralistic and systematizing aesthetic, proposing in- stead a corporeal and perspectival model of seeing that both places her in a feminine tradition and signifies her modernity. In so doing, she provides a model of the observer-as embodied, particularized, and situated-that resists specular hegemony and makes space for women to look at art. The nineteenth century marked the first time in England's history that the fine arts became available for appreciation on a wide scale by a mass audience, thereby creating a demand for popular critical guidance. It was within such a milieu that the modern academic discipl- ine of art history originated and began to become professionalized and institutionalized.6 Despite Matthew Arnold's perception in "The Liter- ary Influence of Academies" (1864) of the deficiency of the critical spirit in England, there was nevertheless no shortage of critical voices in the periodical press and art literature who were keen to direct and regulate public taste in art. Included in their number were many female art specialists, both historians and critics, who, as Deborah Cherry, Pamela Gerrish Nunn, and others have demonstrated, made a signifi- cant contribution to mainstream contemporary aesthetic debate, worked within women's artistic and intellectual networks, and formed distinc- tively female cultural discourses. Of these women, it is Anna Jameson who has received the most critical attention, and therefore it is perhaps not surprising that it is around her work that the question of profes- sional status has been most vigorously debated. Opinion is divided between those, like Adele M. Holcomb, who claim Jameson as "The First Professional English Art Historian," and the view, recently pro- posed by Laurie Kane Lew, that "Jameson's art writings anticipate the development of what has come to be known as 'middlebrow' culture" (832), in their "performed anxiety over what constitutes a cultured taste and a cultivated eye" (838), and their self-representation as "a new form of amateurism" (834). Lew's intelligent discussion of "the liminality of Jameson's status as a critic" (831) can usefully be extended to the many other female art historians and critics who, in positioning themselves as observers and interpreters, were required to negotiate the bound- VICTORIAN STUDIES 80</page><page sequence="5">WOMEN AND THE ENDS OF ART HISTORY aries between amateurism and professionalism, and between popular culture and high culture. If vision has been described as "the master sense of the modern era" (Jay 114), history has conventionally been identified as the master discourse of the nineteenth century, and their conjunction places the newly emergent discipline of art history in a position uniquely eloquent of the cultural moment, casting new light on the gender politics of both visuality and history. Victorian art historical discourse, like other intellec- tual discourses, came to be inflected by contemporary interest in the "Woman Question." Christina Crosby's persuasive thesis in The Ends of History: Victorians and "The Woman Question" (1991) is that "in the nine- teenth century 'history' is produced as man's truth, the truth of a neces- sarily historical Humanity, which in turn requires that 'women' be outside history" (1). My reading of the work of female art historians suggests, however, that it was precisely their awareness of "the radical exclusion of 'women' from the historical" that prompted their own radical insertion of the modern woman into art historical discourse (Crosby 6). The foregrounding of women as producers, subjects, and critics of art sub- verted the totalizing thrust of masculinist universal history. Strategies for reconfiguring and feminizing the history of art varied considerably. One tactic attended to historical women who made or promoted art. The prolific and popular late-nineteenth-century writer Julia Cartwright, for example, anticipating revisionist critiques of the gendered Renaissance of conventional historiography by modern femi- nist historians, wrote a book subtitled A Study of the Renaissance (1899) - not on Leonardo or Raphael but on Beatrice d'Este, Duchess of Milan (1475-97). In 1903, Cartwright wrote another study with the same sub- title on Beatrice's sister, Isabella d'Este, whom she describes as "the supreme representative of Renaissance culture in its highest and most intellectual phase" (Beatrice d Este vi). In these books, Cartwright demon- strates how her archival research into the correspondence of such women illuminates "public events and personages [...] in a new aspect" (Beatrice d Este v). Just as Cartwright's work on Beatrice and Isabella d'Este and her 1913 study of Christina of Denmark (1522-90) recalibrate the his- tory of art from a new, feminized perspective, Ellen Clayton, in her study of English Female Artists (1876), had inserted "women" into "history" in a way that defied conventional representations of the history of art.7 Despite Clayton's initial observation that "our native paintresses, as the old-fashioned art critics and compilers of biographical dictionaries quaintly AUTUMN 1998/1999 81</page><page sequence="6">HILARY FRASER term them, have left but faintly impressed footprints on the sands of time," and "do not glitter in the splendour of renown" (1: 2), she proceeds to trace meticulously the history of women's art in England- from the sixteenth-century artist Susannah Hornebolt, of whom Diirer is reported to have said "it is wonderful that a female should be able to do such work" (qtd. in Clayton 1: 6), to the artists of her own day. Another revisionary tactic employed by women writing art his- tory focused not on the female painter but on the female subject, or on those topics perceived to be womanly. In her volumes on The Poetry of Sacred and Legendary Art (1848), AnnaJameson, for example, formulates whatJudithJohnston calls "a female mythology that at least takes equal place with the male mythologies it contains, and which often takes precedence over them" (189). In particular, in her discussions of the representation in art of the Magdalen and the Madonna, Jameson draws attention to the iconic resonances of such legendary and heroic figures for contemporary women. Reviewers also associated Emilia Dilke's work with the feminine, but for quite different reasons. Her pioneering art historical writing brought Burckhardtian Kunstgeschichte into English art history for the first time. The comprehensive ambit of her work on both Renaissance and eighteenth-century French art was based on original primary research, her knowledge of the social and economic conditions under which art was produced, and her examination of not only an epoch's fine arts, but also its so-called minor arts, in order to gain a true understanding of the period style. The very rigor of her scholarship, then, as well as the modernity of her historicist methodology, led her to attend to the decorative arts and domestic culture of Renaissance and eighteenth-century France. Reviewers were quick to fasten onto the "womanliness" of her art historical practice. An anonymous critic of her first book in the Westminster Review, for example, finds her "history of the Renaissance in France [. . .] little better than a history of furniture." While it was appropriate for a woman to have written about "all that skilled handicraft can do to beautify daily life and make lovely the habitations of man," the reviewer concludes that "a Renaissance whose chief results lie in the department of decorative upholstery cannot, of course, hope to vie with the splendid names and varied qualities of the Italian new birth" (qtd. in Mansfield 170, 186-87).8 Another female art historian whose work straddled the schol- arly and the '"omanly" arts was Mary Merrifield. Merrifield's knowl- edge of ancient traditional painting techniques led the government to VICTORIAN STUDIES 82</page><page sequence="7">WOMEN AND THE ENDS OF ART HISTORY employ her to conduct research connected with the work of the Royal Commission on the Fine Arts. The two major books emerging from this research, The Art of Fresco Painting (1846) and Original Treatises on the Arts of Painting (1849) amount to what Merrifield's modern editor, A. C. Sewter, calls "a very thorough collection of early technical informa- tion and recipes on all the arts, which have still not been superseded" (The Art of Fresco Painting ix). Yet the hybrid form of these volumes, which include translations from ancient treatises, narrative history, rec- ipes, and tables of weights and measures, signifies the uncertainty of their textual status. At once an authoritative history and a practical technical manual, Merrifield's work negotiates between the realms of the artist and the artisan, and between past achievements of high cul- ture and the cultural aspirations of the nineteenth century, in an at- tempt to make the arcane knowledges of the "Old Italian and Spanish Masters" assimilable for the modern reader. Other work is explicitly directed toward a female readership. In her volume Dress as a Fine Art (1854), for instance, Merrifield uses the old "Masters" as a measure of aesthetics in modern female dress, adapting the discourse of high culture to women's fashion. Explaining, for example, that "the study of form on scientific principles, has hitherto been limited entirely to men," but that '"e do think that a knowledge of form may be communicated to all persons, and that a young woman will not make the worse wife, or mother, for understanding the economy of the human frame, and for having acquired the power of appreciating its beauties" (Dress as a Fine Art 22-23), Merrifield illustrates her points about the structure and proportions of the female form by reference to a series of paintings. Later in the same volume are reprinted some articles she wrote for the ArtJournal in 1852 on "Harmony of Colours, in its application to Ladies' Dress." After a detailed explication of color theory, Merrifield critically evaluates the inharmonious colors worn by the Englishwomen she en- counters at the Great Exhibition of 1851, illustrating her points with examples drawn from paintings. Through the discursive heterogeneity of her text, which draws on art history and criticism, contemporary color theory, and women's fashion, Merrifield insists upon a reciprocity between high art and women's experience. Her distinctive critical per- spective, and, in particular, the device of using the old "Masters" in the service of modern women, unsettles established dominant critical dis- courses and appropriates the history of art for domestic culture. But does such a recourse to history, especially a history quite AUTUMN 1998/1999 83</page><page sequence="8">HILARY FRASER explicitly determined by "Masters," amount to a genuinely radical recon- figuration of cultural authority? Or, by attempting to appropriate history for themselves, were women such as Cartwright, Clayton, Dilke,Jameson, and Merrifield, like so many other nineteenth-century women writers in search of intellectual legitimation, merely rewriting their own oppres- sion? In order to probe further the ideological contradictions that mark their work, it is important to locate these female art historians as profes- sional observers within another history: the history of vision in the nineteenth century. As I have indicated, Jonathan Crary's compellingly argued the- sis states that the "reorganization of vision" that occurred in the early- nineteenth century produced "a new kind of observer" definitive of modernity (2-3). Maintaining that "problems of vision, then as now, were fundamentally questions about the body and the operation of social power," he examines how, "beginning early in the nineteenth century, a new set of relations between the body on one hand and forms of institutional and discursive power on the other redefined the status of an observing subject" (3). Anticipating objections to this idea of an undifferentiated, representative nineteenth-century observing body as "something abstracted and divorced from the singularities and im- mense diversity that characterized visual experience in that century," Crary admits that "obviously there was no single nineteenth-century observer, no example that can be located empirically," but explains that he nevertheless wants to "suggest some of the conditions and forces that defined or allowed the formation of a dominant model of what an observer was in the nineteenth century" (7). Of course, as Crary con- cedes, there are other, resistant, marginalized, or oppositional histories of vision that remain to be written. It is with one such alternative history, the history of a particular group of nineteenth-century observers who can be located empirically, that I am here concerned. For the body of the nineteenth-century observer was gendered, and the female observer's relation to various institutions, professions, and discourses was accordingly regulated and circumscribed. To what extent, then, did the new ways of seeing associated with post-Helmholtzian optics manifest themselves in the writings of the women under consideration here?9 Several of them quite clearly exem- plify Crary's theorization of the new "corporeal subjectivity" of the nineteenth-century observer (69). Mary Merrifield's explanation of the principles of the harmony and contrast of colors, for example, like VICTORIAN STUDIES 84</page><page sequence="9">WOMEN AND THE ENDS OF ART HISTORY Goethe's Theory of Colors (1810), which was translated into English in 1840 by Sir Charles Eastlake, recommends experiments to be under- taken by the reader which demonstrate that it is the sensory nerves excited in the eye, not the object of vision, that determine our sense impressions:10 Now, it appears to be a law in the science (for so we must call it) of the harmonious contrast of colours, that when the attention of the eye has been directed steadily upon a colour, (either primitive or secondary) there is a tendency in the organ to see the colour which in the diagram is directly opposite to it, whether it is actually present or not. If, for instance, a red wafer is placed on a sheet of white paper, and the eye is steadily fixed on it for some time, the red wafer will appear to be surrounded by a narrow and very pale circle of green, or if the eye, after looking attentively at a red wafer, be directed to another part of the paper, and the wafer withdrawn, a pale green image of the wafer will be perceived. Green, therefore, is said to be the complementary colour to red, because the eye, after looking fixedly at the red, (one of the primitive colours,) sees an image or spectrum composed of the other two primitive colours which together make green. (Dress as a Fine Art 135) Diagrams of the color spectrum are accompanied by commentary rep- resenting the embodied subject as "the active producer of optical expe- rience" (Crary 69); we are told, for example, that "[t]he warm colours are [. . .] considered as advancing colours because they appear to ap- proach the eye, [and] the cool colours [...] called retiring colours from their appearing to recede from the eye" (Dress as a Fine Art 139). Emilia Dilke was similarly interested in the corporeal material- ity of art from an early age. As a child, she had bought for herself Essays on the Anatomy of Expression in Painting (1806) by Sir Charles Bell, the anatomist and artist who used works of art to show how the inner life is realized physically in the nerves and muscles of the body, and whose research into the physiology of the senses, in particular the distinction between sensory and motor nerves, was foundational in the develop- ment of later-nineteenth-century optics. Her fascination with the inner workings of the body unabated, Dilke continued to study anatomy and dissection while attending the South Kensington School of Art; later still, she tried unsuccessfully to institute life classes for women at the Royal Academy (Eisler 148, 168). Dilke's art historical writing demonstrates Crary's argument about the convergence of "realism" and "subjective vision" in the nineteenth century (9). For example, as Eliz- abeth Mansfield has recently shown, Dilke's discussion of architecture in The Renaissance of Art in France (1879) "departs from conventional art AUTUMN 1998/1999 85</page><page sequence="10">HILARY FRASER historical narrative" in the extent to which she imaginatively recreates lost buildings on the basis only of architectural plans and engravings (Mansfield 174-75). In a prose version of the kind of illusion-generating optical gadgetry that proliferated in the period, Dilke enters buildings in her imagination and invests them with light and substance. Thus, drawing onJacques Du Cerceau's plans of the ruined chateau of Anet, built by Henri II for Diane de Poitiers, Dilke enthuses: He gives us the elevation from a point of view which admits us at once to the centre of the interior court. The grand gateway rises before us connected with the two side wings by buildings which gradually curve inwards from right to left. [. . .] The hapless daring of Actaeon warns the visitor at the entrance. Aloft, above the portal, he struggles, pulled to the ground by his maddened dogs. [...] [T]he wide-spread- ing courts, the far-stretching gardens [.. .] all combine to give an aspect of sunshine and radiance to the splendid palace which rises in their midst. (1: 121, qtd. in Mansfield 175) Conjuring three-dimensional sunlit spaces from seventeenth-century black-and-white architectural elevations, the historical imaginary thus registers the shift from the two-dimensional world defined by the cam- era obscura to the scopic regime of modernity. Such trompe loeil effects can be found in the art historical writing of other nineteenth-century women-AnnaJameson's imagina- tive construction of the view Titian might have seen from his neglected house in Venice, for instance"1-but it is Vernon Lee who was most interested in analyzing the actual processes of seeing and of aesthetic response, and it is in her work that the history of art and the history of vision most interestingly converge. Moreover, it is in her writing that questions relating to gender and sexuality in the visual field are most insistently raised. Born Violet Paget, Vernon Lee adopted her pseudonym in 1877 at the age of twenty-one when she began to publish in the British periodical press. In the following year, she remarked to a friend, "I don't care that Vernon Lee should be known to be myself or any other young woman, as I am sure that no one reads a woman's writing on art, history or aesthetics with anything but unmitigated contempt" (qtd. in Gunn 66). Three decades later she continued to lament the lack of female public intellectuals and speculative thinkers: Nor can I at this moment think of a single modern woman writing on politics or abstract things, whose work is of undisputed importance; except perhaps Mrs. Sidney VICTORIAN STUDIES 86</page><page sequence="11">WOMEN AND THE ENDS OF ART HISTORY Webb, who settles things by the simple process of ordering about the citizens of a state, as she might the servants in the kitchen. (qtd. in Gunn 9) Such comments reveal Lee's awareness of the sexual politics of author- ship, and of the masculinist public discourse that she was required to negotiate as an art historian and aesthetician. While she jokes here about Beatrice Webb's application of household management skills to the affairs of state, she also criticized women who merely attempted to appropriate a masculine position, and deplored "the idea of imitating men's cuffs and collars and documents" (qtd. in Gunn 9). Although she is speaking metaphorically, her own preferred style of dress and general demeanor was, ironically, often described by her contemporaries in the coded language of the day as "mannish."Janet Wolff observes that there was in the period "an apparently common assumption that women who do participate in 'the public' on anything like the same terms as men somehow manifest masculine traits," and speculates that "perhaps this perception of the 'masculine' in women who were visible in a man's world is only the displaced recognition of women's overall exclusion from that world" (42). Lee herself was all too aware of women's exclusion from the public world, and her own simulation of a masculine subject position, both by writing under a pseudonym and in other instances of authorial cross-dressing-such as her playful representation of the collection of essays published under the title Belcaro as "not the Sir-Oracle manual of a professor" (5), but "the copy books of the boy attending a course of lectures" (14) -points to the ambiguous status of women writing in masculine culture. Lee's interest in the tensions and ambiguities sur- rounding gender and sexual identity is also apparent in the feminized men and masculine women in Miss Brown. While satirizing fin-de-siecle aestheticism in a rather heavy-handed fashion, Lee's novel also unsettles gender boundaries and engages in a sustained critique of contemporary sexual and cultural mores. Although it is the male artist protagonist, Hamlin, who has the "delicate, handsome features," and "fair, almost beardless complexion" of the corrupt and "effeminate" male family line (2: 48, 51), and his model and protege Anne Brown whose features are "monumental" (her nose "massive, heavy," her lips "thick, and of curiously bold projection and curl," her neck "round and erect like a tower," and her chest, again, "massive" [1: 24-25]), it is in the feminized artist and aesthete that patriarchal power is nonetheless vested. And AUTUMN 1998/1999 87</page><page sequence="12">HILARY FRASER given the rhetorical identification between women and slaves made prominent by Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792, it is significant that Hamlin's ancestors owned slaves in the West Indies (the source of Vernon Lee's own family money), and that Miss Brown's name suggests her racial origins. When Hamlin wonders if she isJewish, or "some Eastern, dashed with Hindoo or Negro" (1: 27), she explains that she has Moorish blood, and at one point sees herself as having a "strange, half-southern, half-Jewish, and almost half-Ethiopian beauty" (2: 48-49). The play with physical tropes of masculinity and femininity and the inscription of racial exoticism are mechanisms by which a critique of contemporary gender ideology is established.12 The novel has chiefly been read as a satire on decadence, and in this regard is of interest as a measure of Lee's reservations about the aesthetic doctrines of her friend and mentor Walter Pater, at least as they were interpreted by his disciples. Despite his influence over some aspects of her aesthetic, particularly her impressionism, the form that Pater's ideas assume on the lips of the "diaphanous" (2: 66) Hamlin and his fleshly circle is unequivocally critiqued.'3 For the purposes of this essay, the novel's chief interest lies in its dissection, over three volumes, of Hamlin's scopophilic obsession with the beautiful young nursemaid with the Pre-Raphaelite looks whom he makes his model, and who has no identity for him beyond that of the object of his eroticizing gaze. It reveals Lee's acute awareness of the constitution of woman as spectacle in the contemporary visual economy. Anne Brown is constantly described in terms of art works: her head is likened to "certain mournful and sullen heads of Michaelangelo [sic]" (1: 25); she is "a picture by an old master" (1: 126). At one point she asks herself bitterly, "Did he care for her only as a sort of live picture?" (1: 309). It is men who are endowed with visual agency in this text and, character- istically, Lee does not allow her trapped heroine any escape. Anne dreams of going to Girton, and has her opportunities for freedom. At one point in the story, her philanthropic cousin Richard Brown, who, significantly, is losing his eyesight, tells her he will have to engage a young man as his secretary. Although she would like to take this role, she cannot act: "Anne felt a lump in her throat. Oh that she had been a man, instead of being this useless, base creature of mere comely looks, a woman, set apart for the contemplation of aesthetes" (3: 63). Like Miss Valerie Flodden, in Lee's short story "A Worldly Woman" (1890), who herself "made rather a delightful picture" (520), and who despite VICTORIAN STUDIES 88</page><page sequence="13">WOMEN AND THE ENDS OF ART HISTORY her resolution never to enter the servitude of marriage became Mrs. Hermann Struwe, Miss Brown succumbs at the end of the novel to the pressure to become Hamlin's wife. I have dwelt at some length on Miss Brown because it provides a crucial background to Lee's work in aesthetics. Although it does contain an intriguing vignette of an advanced young woman "studying eye-surgery with a famous Rhenish oculist" (1: 211-12), the novel pres- ents the visual field as definitively masculine, and the female protag- onist's abject dependence upon a man explicitly connects to their specular relation. HenryJames, to whom the novel was, to his embar- rassment, dedicated, wrote to Lee saying, "[Y]ou take the aesthetic business too seriously, too tragically, and above all with too great an implication of sexual motives [. . .] you have impregnated all those people too much with the sexual, the basely erotic preoccupation" (qtd. in Gunn 104-05). Miss Brown does indeed demonstrate its author's interest in the psycho-physiology and pathology of sex, in scopophilic fetishism and hysteria, and firmly links visual and sexual economies. In the light of this novel and its preoccupations, Lee's writings in aesthetics and art history and criticism, even where they disavow questions of gender and sexual difference, are clearly informed by a sophisticated understanding of the sexual politics of spectatorship. The novel form enabled her to rehearse intersubjectivity and acknowledge the politics of the gaze in ways that illuminate her more ideologically circumscribed art historical discourse. Furthermore, the narrative tensions between resistance and capitulation to the imperatives of the gender order illuminate the tensions and contradictions inhabiting Lee's writing in aesthetics. Indeed, the ideological closure of the novel could be read as paradigmatic of other closures in her art historical writing.'4 One sign that Lee achieved cultural authority as an observer is provided by the portraits of her in her glasses by John Singer Sargent and Berthe Noufflard (reproduced in Gunn 165, 189). "Glasses worn by a woman in the cinema," Mary Ann Doane notes, "do not generally signify a deficiency in seeing but an active looking, or even simply the fact of seeing as opposed to being seen." The intellectual woman, she adds, "looks and analyses, and in usurping the gaze she poses a threat to an entire system of representation. It is as if the woman had forcefully moved to the other side of the specular" (83). Lee herself boldly made such a move, and in the full range of her writing-from her descriptive AUTUMN 1998/1999 89</page><page sequence="14">HILARY FRASER landscape sketches to her art historical work to her writings on psycho- logical aesthetics-she decisively usurped the gaze. Lee lived most of her adult life in Florence, and her encounter with Italy was deeply felt. She wrote sketches of Italian towns, land- scapes, and gardens which minutely detail her emotional response to Italy; the effect of its beauty on her feelings-it is to such works that Browning's poem alludes-and her writing about its history and its art was similarly rooted in her response to its material presence. As she wrote in her first book on the Italian Renaissance, Euphorion (1884): [T]he Renaissance has been to me [. .] not so much a series of studies as a series of impressions. I have not mastered the history and literature of the Renaissance (first-hand or second-hand, perfectly or imperfectly), abstract and exact, and then sought out the places and things which would make that abstraction somewhat more concrete in my mind; I have seen the concrete things, and what I might call the concrete realities of thought and feeling left behind by the Renaissance, and then tried to obtain from books some notion of the original shape and manner of wearing these relics, rags and tatters of a past civilization. (1: 16) Yet even as she declared her commitment to a concept of history as a "series of impressions" of "concrete things," she was aware, as a child of her time, of the power of optical illusion. For example, the unveil- ing of an altar-piece may seem to be "much more than the mere displaying of a picture: it is the sudden bringing us face to face with the real life of the Renaissance." But it remains, she concedes, "a mere delusion, a deceit like those dioramas which we have all been into as children" (1: 20-21). Her experiences of looking at art are always thus framed by a consciousness of visuality that is distinctively modern in its skeptical questioning of referential fidelity and in its ironic aware- ness of simulation. Crary's work on vision and modernity has rewritten the "core narrative" of the origins of modernist visual art and culture in the late-nineteenth century, arguing that the break with classical models of vision that took place "was far more than simply a shift in the appearance of images and art works, or in systems of representational conventions." It was, he contends, "inseparable from a massive reorganization of knowl- edge and social practices that modified in myriad ways the productive, cognitive, and desiring capacities of the human subject" (3). Lee's art historical writing is located within this epistemic shift. As she herself points out in the lengthy methodological introduction to Euphorion, she VICTORIAN STUDIES 90</page><page sequence="15">WOMEN AND THE ENDS OF ART HISTORY surveys the past in much the same way as the Impressionist painter surveys the landscape: [T]he past, to the people who were in it, was not a miraculous map or other marvellous diagram constructed on the principle of getting at the actual qualities of things by analysis; [. . .] [I]t must have been, to its inhabitants, but a series of constantly varied perspectives and constantly varied schemes of colour, according to the position of each individual, and the light in which that individual viewed it [.. .] the perspective and colour valuation of individual minds there must have been; and since it is not given to us to reproduce those of the near spectator in a region which we can never enter, we may yet sometimes console ourselves for the too melancholy abstractions and averageness of scientific representation, by painting that distant historic country as distant indeed, but as its far-off hill ranges and shimmering plains really appear in their combination of form and colour, from the height of an individual interest of our own, and beneath the light of our individual character. We see only very little at a time, and that little is not what it appeared to the men of the past; but we see at least, if not the same things, yet in the same manner in which they saw, as we see from the standpoints of personal interest and in the light of personal temper. (1: 11-12) Distancing herself from the abstract, scientific mapper of the past, as well as from contemporary exponents of universal history,5 Lee here identifies herself as a modern Nietzschean subject, for whom there are no facts, only perspectives. An ineluctably modern corporeal observer, she confesses to having "followed up those pleasurable and painful impressions rather more than [she has] sought to discover the exact geography of the historical tract which gave them." She describes her historical studies, in fact, as "mere impressions developed by means of study [. . .] currents of thought and feeling in myself, which have found and swept along with them certain items of Renaissance lore" (1: 14-16). Her fascination with those "currents of thought and feeling" within herself-with the processes and psychology of perception-led to her later research into psychological aesthetics. Arguably her most original contribution to nineteenth-century intellectual history, this re- search isolated her from the literary mainstream and contributed to the loss of her wide reading audience (Mannocchi 232). With her friend and collaborator, the painter Clementina (Kit) Anstruther-Thomson, whom she had first met in 1887, she performed a series of empirical experiments into physiological responses to art and discovered the general principle of an aesthetics of empathy (Wellek 236). Beginning with her 1894 purchase of WilliamJames's Principles of Psychology (1890), AUTUMN 1998/1999 91</page><page sequence="16">HILARY FRASER she began to study psychological literature, moving then to read con- temporary Continental and particularly German psychology. Her ideas, however, developed independently of the more scientific wing of the emerging discipline. Indeed, in her Preface to Beauty and Ugliness and Other Studies in Psychological Aesthetics, published jointly with Anstruther- Thomson in 1912, she avers that "my aesthetics will always be those of the gallery and the studio, not of the laboratory. They will never achieve scientific certainty. They will be based on observation rather than ex- periment; and they will remain, for that reason, conjectural and sugges- tive" (viii). She then represents herself and her collaborator as "travellers and antiquarians of the old school [. . .] as compared with the system- atic excavators of our own day" (viii). It is as an intervention in the history of vision and visuality, closely bound to early developments in psychology and physiology, that this work is of most interest. Terry Eagleton begins The Ideology of the Aesthetic (1990) with the claim that "[a]esthetics is born as a discourse of the body" (13), and this is a principle upon which Vernon Lee insists, proposing an "Anthropomorphic Aesthetics" dependent upon a "pro- jection of our inner experience into the forms which we see and realise" (Lee and Anstruther-Thomson 17). In an extraordinary demonstration of Crary's claim that the nineteenth-century realist project was ironi- cally built upon "subjective vision" (9), Lee reconfigures realism as realization. By contrast with Ruskin's critical rejection of the "pathetic fallacy" in Volume Three of Modern Painters (1856), Lee promotes an aesthetic of empathy, which is articulated in strikingly corporeal terms: "[I]n looking at the Doric column, for instance, and its entablature, we are attributing to the lines and surfaces, to the spatial forms, those dynamic experiences we should have were we to put our bodies into similar conditions" (Lee and Anstruther-Thomson 20). Thus, as she later remarked, "[T]he aesthetic seeing, the 'realisation' of form, was connected [.. .] with bodily conditions and motor phenomena" that included "'muscular strains,"' "'sensations of direction' [. . .] and sen- sations of modification in the highly subtle apparatus for equilibrium," and, finally, "sensations of altered respiration and circulation sufficient to account for massive conditions of organic well-being and the reverse" (Lee and Anstruther-Thomson 25-26). In her art historical and critical writing, Lee distinguished her aesthetic from Ruskin's ethical and transcendentalist view that, as she expressed it in Belcaro, "the whole system of the beautiful is a system of VICTORIAN STUDIES 92</page><page sequence="17">WOMEN AND THE ENDS OF ART HISTORY moral emotions, moral selection, and moral appreciation; and [. . .] the aim and end of art is the expression of man's obedience to God's will" (205). Although she admires aspects of Ruskin's work, Lee rejects his typological aesthetic and his teleological view of history, like other women art historians such as Emilia Dilke.16 Their differences had clearly emerged in their respective preferences for the Renaissance and the Middle Ages, as well as in their conflicting judgments of particular works of art. In Belcaro, Lee develops her own "art-philosophy entirely unabstract, unsystematic, essentially personal" (9), in contrast to Ruskin's "impossible system" (200). But it is in Lee's later writings on aesthetics that their fundamental perceptual differences are fully artic- ulated. Whereas Ruskin famously argued, for instance, that the power of Gothic derived on the one hand from its spiritual integrity as the most Christian of architectural forms and on the other from its fidelity to nature,17 for Lee and her collaborator it is the "extraordinary manip- ulation of our sense of equilibrium" that is said to constitute "the raison d'etre of all great Gothic sculpture, even when the figures or plants represented seem extraordinarily and exclusively realistic in treatment" (201). Again, while in Renaissance Fancies and Studies (1895) Lee cri- tiqued Ruskin's distorted views of medieval and Renaissance funerary monuments, in Beauty and Ugliness she more broadly analyzes perspec- tive and addresses questions concerning the position and movement of the spectator (Lee and Anstruther-Thomson 212, 219).18 Or, to take a final example, Lee earlier countered Ruskin's reading of the decoration of the churches of Lucca, which in her view manifested the "optimism of the orthodox symbolist," by arguing instead that "the minds of the sculptors seem haunted by the terror of wicked old beasts, irresistable and mysterious, as in the night fears of children" (Renaissance Fancies 44); but, later, in Beauty and Ugliness she articulates a more general theory which insists that "the aesthetic phenomenon is individual, and varies with every single individual form; and since it consists in the attribution of an individual and varying complexus of dynamic (and perhaps organic) conditions, it must always, in real experience, bear the character of the individual form by which it is elicited" (31). In both her art historical writing and her aesthetics, then, Lee opposes the universal truth claims posited by empiricism with a stren- uous affirmation of relativism. Just as she insists upon the significance of the "standpoints of personal interest" from which stories of the past are told, so she asserts the individual perspective of the observer in the AUTUMN 1998/1999 93</page><page sequence="18">HILARY FRASER field of vision. Her situated and localized interpretative strategies, and her ideas about the particularized and experiential nature of percep- tion, make room for multiple versions of spectatorship, and so empower women's looking. This much may be inferred from her evident interest elsewhere in questions of sexuality and visual agency. Yet the difference upon which she insists is nowhere explicitly identified as sexed or gendered in her writing on psychological aesthetics. Lee enacts in her art historical writing Crary's embodied, agential, and perspectival model of seeing, and yet the material implications of such a corporeal aesthetic are not realized, and her model of the observer appears to be as disconcertingly ungendered as Crary's. Her empiricist individualism was, it might be argued, so ideologically bound to physiological organ- icism that gendering was foreclosed.'9 Are there, nevertheless, ways in which gender intersects Lee's art historical writing? It seems to me that one way of reading this work as gendered is to view her articulation of the empathic imagination as a recuperation of Ruskin's highly gendered account of the "pathetic fallacy." "The temperament which admits the pathetic fallacy, is," he opines, "that of a mind and body in some sort too weak to deal fully with what is before them or upon them; borne away, or over-clouded, or over-dazzled by emotion." The ideal poetical temperament occurs, he argues, "when the intellect also rises, till it is strong enough to assert its rule against, or together with, the utmost efforts of the passions; and the whole man stands in an iron glow, white hot, perhaps, but still strong" (5: 208). By contrast, Lee's valorization of empathy may be conceived as a feminized imaginative strategy, designed to legitimate the specificity of the woman's gaze.20 Differentiating between orthodox masculine Romanticism and what she identifies as feminine Romanticism, Anne K. Mellor describes the latter as "based on a subjectivity constructed in relation to other subjectivities, hence a self that is fluid, absorptive, responsive, with permeable ego boundaries" (209). It is a formulation that effectively accommodates Vernon Lee's aesthetic of empathy. Moreover, in distin- guishing Dorothy Wordsworth's construction of the self from her brother's, Mellor emphasizes that Dorothy's is an embodied self (156- 57). Adapting Mellor's argument to Vernon Lee, I suggest that it is in her inscription of the body as the determining condition of her identity as historian, aesthetician, and observer that Lee affirms her gendered VICTORIAN STUDIES 94</page><page sequence="19">WOMEN AND THE ENDS OF ART HISTORY subjectivity, even though gender is displaced in her discursive represen- tation of physical embodiment. Both her historiographical practice and her aesthetic are so grounded in the body, so exemplary of that "carnal density of vision" which Crary identifies with modernity (150), as to separate radically her work from the "impossible system" of Ruskin, whom she describes as "a man left far behind by the current of modern thought" (Belcaro 201). Ruskin's celebrated theory of the "innocence of the eye," which is often taken to affirm the new primacy of vision in the nineteenth century (Crary 95), effectively infantilizes and desexualizes opticality, separating out and giving autonomy to the sense of sight in a way that strangely decorporealizes it. By contrast, Lee rejects the moralized aesthetic that confers innocence or guilt upon the eye, "mak- ing the physical the mere reflexion of the moral" (Belcaro 205), and with it rejects the privileging of the spiritual over the physical that is sanc- tioned by the masculinist Platonic, Christian, and Cartesian traditions (Mellor 157). In so doing, she declares not only her modernity, emphat- ically dissociating herself from "a generation which is rapidly passing away" (Belcaro 201), but also, albeit obliquely, her subject position as a feminine corporeal observer. "Sight perhaps deceives," concedes the female speaker in Browning's "Inapprehensiveness"; but her male companion will brook no such uncertainty, distinguishing firmly between "fancies that might be" (hers) and "facts that are!" (his). But, despite his confidence in a trans- gendered empiricist universalism, the woman holds her "inapprehensive stare," and as readers we understand her differentiated, active, and con- stitutive role in apprehending the world. It is a poem that brilliantly reveals the faultlines in the field of the history of vision in the nineteenth century.21 At the close of her book Sexuality in the Field of Vision (1986), Jacqueline Rose makes the point that "our previous history is not the petrified block of a singular visual space since, looked at obliquely, it can always be seen to contain its moments of unease" (232-33). It is perhaps in such disquieting fissures and gaps that the unconventional, often op- positional, work of these nineteenth-century women can be located. Mar- tin Jay has postulated that "the scopic regime of modernity may best be understood as a contested terrain, rather than a harmoniously integrated complex of visual theories and practices," that it may, in fact, "be charac- terized by a differentiation of visual sub-cultures" (114-15). I have tried to suggest some of the ways in which the works of several Victorian women AUTUMN 1998/1999 95</page><page sequence="20">HILARY FRASER art historians, critics, and aestheticians constitute one such visual subcul- ture, the recognition of which enables other histories than Ruskin's tele- ological and typological history of art to be heard.

See also Horton. 30n the female gaze see, for example, Doane; Gamman and Marshment (partic- ularly the introduction); Lewis; Pollock. I'm using the term "spectatorship" as it is em- ployed by the feminist art and film critics to whom I refer. However, mindful of Crary's careful distinction between spectator and observer (the former term suggesting, for Crary, "a passive onlooker at a spectacle," the latter, "one who sees within a prescribed set of possibilities, one who is embedded in a system of conventions and limitations" [5-6]), I should note that it is the status of the female art historian as observer that most interests me. 4There has been, however, a growing interest in the role of women art historians and critics since Claire Richter Sherman and Adele M. Holcomb published their edited volume of critical studies, Women as Interpreters of the Visual Arts, 1820-1979, in 1981.

In Lee's aesthetic, organicism preempts biologism (which might admit sexual difference). I am again grateful to Gail Jones for this suggestion. 20Lewis's discussion of "The Problematic Authority of the Female Orientalist Gaze" is of interest in relation to Vernon Lee's attempt to establish the authority of the empathic gaze. Writing of the artist Henriette Browne, Lewis argues "a position emerges in which is constructed for women a knowledge that is both particular and diminutive. It is a knowledge that has some authority because it is experiential (but that is trivialized because it rests on womanly empathy rather than the clinical detachment of the author- itative scientific gaze) and that is emotional (but petty because its emotions are merely those of feminine sympathy and intuition rather than the grand passion of the Roman- tics)" (179). 21Crosby argues that feminism must not remain in thrall to the concept of a monolithic history, and maintains that "the task of the historian is to articulate the faultlines in the field" (150).
