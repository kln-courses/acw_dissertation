<plain_text><page sequence="1">LUCRETIUS By H. F. HOSE T HE physical theories of Democritus were and are pro- foundly interesting as an attempt to answer some of the great questions of natural science-how to account for growth and change, for the fact that earth turns into corn, corn into men, and men again into earth. The early Ionic philosophers had seen that some necessary common basis must be found, and had sought it in water or fire or some other supposed element. The inadequacy of these explanations soon became evident to the rapidly growing Greek intellect, and Democritus found the common basis in atoms, indestructible and indivisible; an infinite number of these were moving through space, differing in shape and hardness; the movement of the atoms had a certain swerve which enabled them to meet, and the meeting of infinite numbers enabled those of the right shape and texture to join and form the things we see (res in Lucretius). Atoms and void-there was nothing else, and nothing else was needed to produce the world we know. This is a purely physical theory and might be held by Napoleon, Cleopatra, or Charles Peace, nor is it capable of being made the subject of a great poem When Epicurus, in a denationalized Greece, was formu- lating a system of morals which should give men peace of mind in life and death, he seized on Democritus' physical theory to assist him. Peace of mind demanded freedom from the fears and hopes of arbitrary divine intervention, from the desire of material things. There was no Trr6oas to make an invigorating call on men's activities; even in Plato's time its voice had weakened almost to silence. The religion of the past had been torn to shreds by poets and philosophers. It only remained for the sage to regard himself calmly as a fortuitous conjunction of atoms, and so to regulate his life that body and mind passed as placidly as possible the period that was to elapse before the conjunction was dissolved. Here, again, why make a poem about it? Why undergo the poet's agony, his alternations of sublimity and despair, when a few chatty epistles or quiet talks 387I19 M</page><page sequence="2">162 LUCRETIUS could put those who wished to know in possession of a rational theory of life ? Then how came the poem of Lucretius, the devout Epicurean, to be written? How did this great poem spring forth from a barren atomic physics and a garden-seat system of morals ? Whence came the passion, the fervour and the impulse, the unquenchable emotion, the divine madness that a great poem implies ? The answer to these questions is in the character of Lucretius. Of his life and himself, apart from the poem, we know practically nothing; he lived in the last days of the Roman republic, was a member of a great Roman family, and a friend of Cicero. To this meagre array of facts a late and very dubious authority adds that he suffered from the effects of a love-potion. So for our knowledge of Lucretius we depend upon his poem. He is an apostle, a fanatic; he is to Epicurus as Luther to Erasmus. But he is that strangest of types, an apostle against religion. The fervour and the impulse, the deep spring of emotion, come from the determination to destroy, not to propagate, religion. This fervour and this emotion animate even the barren tracts of physical discussion, and shed an immortal, if a sombre glory over the mountain-heights of his pronouncements on life and death. He feels the appalling sadness of a lost world as deeply as St. Paul, and sets himself with the same ardour to save it. But St. Paul is not a poet and Lucretius is. So we must look for something more in Lucretius-two things, the poet's mind and the poet's art. The poet's mind means the sympathetic observa- tion of the facts of human life and nature, and the poet's art their transmutation into poetry by a masterly use of language and metre. The poet's mind means the grasp of a great subject, the power to keep it steadily in view and not lose sight of it in the pursuit of beauty of detail; the poet's art means the power to uplift the reader by the compelling power of words and metre into the regions in which the poet is moving, to set the reader on the heights and make him see the visions. In these respects there is, naturally, a great likeness between Lucretius and the Milton of Paradise Lost. This likeness goes further. In both cases the subject, or</page><page sequence="3">LUCRETIUS 163 a great part of the subject, is intractable. Hence what must in a sense be called the splendid failure of both poems, the De Rerum Natura and Paradise Lost. Theology and physics resist the process of transmutation into poetry, and the alchemy of the greatest poets can do nothing but gild them faintly. In both cases our enjoyment of the poem comes in the main from the passages, fortunately abundant, where the transmutation is into purest gold. Yet in both cases the effort of the whole task is so magnificent that we would not have it otherwise, and feel that the greatest parts could not be detached from this setting. Lucretius is not a great philosopher, if by that we mean either one who produces some great idea in the world of thought, or one who can survey and compare all systems impartially. He is rather the intelligent disciple, who can assimilate and expound his master's doctrines and his master's unsparing con- futations of other thinkers. There is nothing original in his system, though it happens, by the chances of survival, to be the most complete and coherent exposition of the ideas of Democritus and Epicurus. But he is a philosopher at least in two respects. He can grasp the whole of his system in a broad sweeping view and contain in his mind its fundamental ideas. Secondly, he can arrange and expound clearly and logically; he can build up and complete his edifice so thoroughly that no part is left in air, or unrelated to the rest of the structure. The slight defects in treatment or arrangement which exist in the poem as we have it are due to the fact that it was never com- pletely revised. Much that would seem unsatisfactory in a modern scientific treatise, the ready acceptance of imperfect explanations of natural phenomena, or the suggestion of three or four explanations as all equally good, is a radical feature of the Epicurean system. Epicurus was only concerned to show that a natural explanation of phenomena was possible; it was futile to discuss which of several was right. Why the sun behaved differently at different seasons, why it rose and set, mattered little, if only it could be shown that its movements were suscep- tible of explanation on completely natural grounds, and did not require or admit of any arbitrary supernatural intervention.</page><page sequence="4">164 LUCRETIUS But Lucretius is a great original poet. There are of course, as in all poets, echoes in the details of thought and language, echoes of Ennius, of the Greek tragedians. But even they are fainter than in many great poets. Lucretius looked on life and nature with his own eyes, formed his own impressions, and put them into great and memorable words, and wove them into that great tapestry that hangs, sombre but glorious, on the walls of the temple of poetry. Life is sad, and the world is full of mocking shows, but there is one unfailing anodyne, the quest and discovery of truth. And the finder, whose heart is purified (pectus purgatum) while he has a lofty scorn for the futilities of men, for ambition, for war, for wealth and pleasure-seeking, gains many a gentle and serene pleasure in the contemplation of Nature and the observation of her ways and in the recogni- tion of beauty in the simple and sober forms of human relation- ship and society. There is a further point that deserves notice. Lucretius tries hard to be a thorough-going materialist. He banishes the gods to some interlunar space, and is at pains to prove that they could not have, or desire to have, any hand in the creation or government of the world. The fortuitous concourse of atoms in the void, none can doubt, none shall doubt that this is all. Yet in the poet's mind there rise continually in the background suggestions of mysterious powers which the philosopher would banish. Nature and the Earth-mother guide and foster growth and progress, and appear more than once as very dimly-con- ceived beneficent beings, without whom, somehow, the con- junction of atoms would not have produced quite such an harmonious result. Of these appearances the poet seems almost unconscious, the philosopher wholly unconscious. But the poet at least is fully conscious of the wonderful invocation of an unmistakable deity at the outset of the work, the mystical but very anthropomorphic Venus who sways the hearts of gods and men and beasts and all living things and enables them to increase after their kind. How she comes into this atomic world, what is the full meaning of this introductory palinode, no critic has ever fully explained.</page></plain_text>
