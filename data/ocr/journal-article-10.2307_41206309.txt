On the trail of a forgotten Irish bird Lorcán OToole and Ronan O'Flaherty seek to restore the crane to its proper place in Irish history and mythology a bird as big as a golden eagle, Imagine over lm high, with a wingspan of 2m or more, that can flock in thousands. Now make this enormous bird an inhabitant of marsh, wetland and other liminal space; give it an instantly recognisable cry and, for good measure, a quite astonishing courtship dance. Now try to imagine it in Ireland. It somehow doesn't seem to 'fit' in our ordered landscape- iťs too big, too exotic, and yet it has only been absent for some 300 years. This is Grus grus, the Eurasian crane (Fig. 1), and it once flocked here literally in its thousands. Wherever crane species occur in Europe, Asia and North America they present an unforgettable sight which over the years has fostered a rich fabric of cultural tradition. Similarly rich Archaeology Ireland Spring 2011 traditions must have accompanied its presence here in Ireland, so how has this incredible bird managed to vanish not just from our landscape but also from our consciousness? Part of the problem lies in its Irish name, an con, which it shares with another bird, the grey heron (Adrea cinerea), known in Irish as an corr glas. As the crane declined and eventually became extinct, the traditions surrounding it, and even places named after it, were attributed instead to the heron. The crane was forgotten, and when preparing translations and</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2 - Scene from the base of the North Cross, Ahenny, Co. Tipperary (H.S. Crawford). explanations for a predominantly English- speaking audience, the researchers, antiquarians and place-name experts interpreted what they read in terms of what they could see, and that was a heron, not a crane, which nobody had even heard of for hundreds of years. The crane has, quite literally, been written out of Irish history. Yet if we cannot recognise its presence and, worse, if we cannot realise its impact, our understanding of the past is necessarily flawed. This bird was as dominant a feature of the landscape in certain parts of Ireland as was the buffalo in North America. Arguably the most dramatic and spectacular sight of the early Irish landscape, it must have coloured the attitudes, beliefs and perspective of all who witnessed it. A simple awareness of the existence of this magnificent bird here in Ireland makes a new layer of interpretation possible. Take the well-known scene from the base of the North Cross at Ahenny, Co. Tipperary (Fig. 2). The scene itself has been something of a conundrum for generations of archaeologists and art historians, with biblical narrative, native epic or historical event all offered as the possible subject- matter. Look at the creature leading the procession, however: while its identification has puzzled many commentators, it is quite clearly a crane. Its size and profile, and the unique bustle at its rear, make that very clear, but because the bird has been absent for so long from the Irish landscape it has not to date been identified as such. Its position in the 14 procession is interesting: this is clearly a 'domestic' animal of some sort, and we know from the early literature that a bird called a 'corf was often kept as a pet by saints and nobles. Fergus Kelly points out that, apart from cats and dogs, the animal most frequently mentioned in the law- tracts as a pet is in fact this 'coď. As mentioned already, con can mean either a crane or a heron, but herons make poor pets, unlike cranes, so it seems likely that the con referred to in the law-tracts is a crane. Crane bones turn up on several Irish sites, including royal sites such as Lagore crannog, which invites the suggestion that the birds may have been kept as royal pets here in Ireland, as they were in fact in many other countries. The word con itself is probably onomatopoeic, echoing the crane's unique, far-carrying call, a guttural 'kror-r-r or' or a jarring 'karr'. This cry is very different from the harsh squawk of a heron, which again makes it far more likely that the generic word con in the Irish tracts refers to the crane and not the heron. It also makes it likely that the word itself, which has a great many meanings in Irish (a projecting point, an odd thing, boggy areas, etc.) was originally applied first to the bird, only acquiring all those other meanings thereafter. This is important when we come to consider the place-name evidence. Right: Fig. 3 - Distribution map of place- names in Ireland either beginning with 'Cor' (yellow pins) or otherwise connected (red pins). Research by Dr Derek Yalden in Britain has shown that, with 225 place-names to its credit, no other wild bird appears more often than the crane, although it has been extinct in Britain for hundreds of years. Here in Ireland, similar research by the first- named author has identified over a thousand townland names beginning with Cor, and another 140 place-names that include the word in some form or other (e.g. Lough Gur - Loch na gCon). One has, of course, to take great care when delving into this area, particularly as the word con in Irish has acquired so many other meanings, as mentioned above. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that first and foremost the word was applied to the bird, and that many of these supplementary meanings may stem from the distinctive nature and habits of that bird, the projecting beak, the love of wet places and so on. An examination of the regional distribution of place-names reveals high densities across the north midlands (Fig. 3), areas of poor-draining soils and extensive bogland, which in the past would have offered ideal habitat for breeding cranes. There are good grounds for believing that some if not most of these 'cor' place-names do actually refer to the bird and indicate areas where nesting cranes were an established feature of the landscape. The presence of flocks of cranes Archaeology Ireland Spring 201 1</page><page sequence="3">Above: Fig. A - Bronze Age 'crane dance'? A scene from the rock-art gallery of Mont Bego. Below: Fig. 5 - Common crane jumping and fighting (© Jose B. Ruiz, naturepl.com). may be indicated by place-names such as Curragh or Curach, possibly meaning 'crane-meadow'. Cranes appear to have had some religious significance also in early Ireland, in that their flesh was apparently taboo. According to Giraldus Cambrensis, the Irish of his day refused to eat the flesh of cranes, encountering it with some shock as a meat for the first time at a great feast hosted by Henry II outside Dublin in 1171. The taboo nature of its meat continued for centuries in Scotland, where its consumption could even precipitate death. The privileged position of the bird, combining social familiarity with taboo, suggests some sacred status. It is interesting to note that the procession the crane leads in that scene from the high cross at Ahenny is just one part of a frieze running around the base, and which includes a funeral procession on the opposite side. The connection between the two is not clear, but it may be significant that right across the world the crane is often seen as a messenger between this world and the next, sometimes even as the conveyor of the spirit to the afterlife. Whatever its role in this scene, these are dramatic events which are being portrayed and each participant would have been selected carefully before the tableau was carved. THE CRANE IN IRELAND Cranes also represented some form of darker sorcery, at least in druidical circles. The law-tracts describe a practice of corrguinecht, or crane-slaying, in which the druid (or ftlidh), standing on one foot with one arm extended and one eye closed, would pronounce a fatal curse against his unfortunate victim. Cranes feature regularly in Irish mythology, but their best-known manifestation is probably in the form of the famous 'Crane Bag of the Fianna'. This was a bag full of magical treasures created by the god Manannan from the skin of Aoife, princess of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who had been transformed into a crane. The Crane Bag is clearly some form of sacred regalia, and its possession through the ages bestows kingship and/or military power. A darker aspect to the crane is also apparent in our nearest neighbour, Britain. At Biddenham an altar carved with a crane was associated with a human deposition. On the Continent the bird appears sporadically but significantly in Celtic iconography. On the Pilier des Nautes, in Archaeology Ireland Spring 2011 15</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 6 - A replica Bronze Age halberd mounted in its timber shaft suggests morphological links with the head of a crane. THE CRANE IN IRELAND Paris, there is a depiction of a tree and a large bull with three marsh-birds perched on its back and head. The associated inscription reveals a dedication to Tarvostrigaranus, or 'the Bull with Three Cranes'. A very similar scene comes from Trier, in Germany, where a god hacks at a tree in which appears the head of a bull and, again, three cranes. Miranda Green has drawn attention to the similarities between these Continental depictions and the bronze bull from Maiden Castle that bears three humanoid female figures upon its back: the arrangement is the same, except that now we have females instead of cranes. This immediately calls to mind the Irish links between cranes and the female supernatural, and indeed the transformation of Aoife herself into that crane from which Manannan made his famous treasure bag. Clearly, there is some deep religious significance to these scenes and associations that we cannot easily grasp today, but it equally clearly shows that the crane held a role in the Celtic supernatural which is very similar to its treatment in other societies across the globe and during all periods. And this is not just poetic licence: veneration of the crane is indeed worldwide and spans all periods. Its very erect bipedal walk undoubtedly bestows certain anthropomorphic characteristics to the bird, as does its similar height, socialisation and extensive vocalisation. Perhaps as a result, the crane has become the subject of mythological, spiritual and cultural traditions from Scandinavia down to Egypt, across Europe, Africa, the Far East (in particular Korea, China and Japan), Australia and North America. These traditions span a period of at least 4,000 years, from 2000 ВС to the present day. In the Far East it has been continuously venerated for much of that time. At the end of the Second World War, Emperor Hirohito 'with the voice of the crane' advised the Japanese parliament to accept capitulation to the allied forces: the reference was well known to his audience - the clear, authoritative voice of the crane cannot be contradicted. One interesting feature of the various cults surrounding the bird is the prevalence of 'Crane Dances' as part of their paraphernalia. Such dances ^^^^ have been recorded in ^^^^^^k various parts of Europe, in ^^^^^^B the Mediterranean, ^^^^^^B Africa, China, Japan, ^^^^^H Siberia, Australia and ^^^^^Ш North America.

Compare ^^m it, for example, with the ^^1 photo of common cranes ^^Ш jumping and fighting (Fig. 5). ^^H And do, by any chance, these ^^H extraordinary weapons - halberds - imitate the shape of a crane's head and beak? The crane is renowned for the ferocity of the stabbing blow it can deliver from its head. When Colm Cille is making his furtive copy of that fateful manuscript of St Finnian's, it is a pet crane that sees Finnian's servant spying through a crack in the door and pecks the eye from his head. Similarly, when Cuchulain's warp spasm overtakes him, one eye sinks so deeply into his head that, we are told, a wild crane could hardly have plucked it out. And such injuries are not confined to the distant past: at a recent international conference of crane specialists from around the world, experts managing captive crane breeding programmes related tales of handlers losing the sight of an eye as a result of stabbing by immature cranes. The shape of the halberd blade might have been modelled directly on the crane's bill, such is the similarity, and when mounted in its shaft the overall effect is astonishingly bird-like (Fig. 6). The key centres for the development and use of the halberd in Bronze Age Europe - central Europe, Spain and Ireland - are still, or were, strongholds for breeding or wintering populations of cranes numbering tens of thousands. For an archaeological conundrum such as surrounds the origins of the halberd, perhaps we might look for answers in a natural stimulus, and a common veneration and respect for a remarkable bird. The recent decision to convert much of Bord na Móna's cut-away bog to environmental use now opens up the possibility of reintroducing the crane to Ireland after an absence of at least 300 years. These cut-away bogs, which will in time revert to a mosaic of wet woodland, reedbed and open water, offer near-ideal conditions for the establishment of a breeding population of cranes. Such a project should be enthusiastically supported by archaeologists, as well as by environmentalists and ecologists, for the opportunity it offers to recreate an ancestral landscape, an outdoor laboratory where the interaction of humans with their environment can be explored at first hand. ■ Archaeology Ireland Spring 2011 16</page></plain_text>
