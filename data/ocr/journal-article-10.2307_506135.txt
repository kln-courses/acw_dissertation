<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology and Epistemology: Dialoguing across the Darwinian Chasm BRUCE G. TRIGGER Abstract Archaeological theorists employ rival epistemologies (theories of knowledge) borrowed from philosophy to justify and help implement alternative programs for interpreting archaeological data. Epistemological ideal- ism has been used to validate cognitive studies of the past, positivism to privilege behaviorist and processual approaches, and realism to promote a combination of both while at the same time noting the constraints ex- erted by external reality. It is argued that, viewed from the perspective of biological evolution, these three ap- proaches are complementary rather than competing. All human adaptation to the social and natural envi- ronments is cognitively and culturally mediated, while, contrary to the claims of extreme idealists, discrepan- cies between expectations and observed happenings fa- cilitate more effective adaptive behavior. Any rounded interpretation of archaeological data must take account of mental concepts, sensory perceptions, and conditions external to the individual. Positivist methods and hu- manistic forms of analysis that focus on subjectivity, agency, and the historical transmission of knowledge are complementary to one another. To understand bet- ter what has happened in the past, archaeologists must produce scenarios that are radically different from what has previously been conceived. But these speculations in turn must be subjected to rigorous appraisal if gen- uine progress is to be achieved. Because of its greater inclusiveness and specific postulates, a realist episte- mology, combined with a materialist view of reality, offers the most satisfactory general framework for integrating the best features of all three epistemologies and inter- preting archaeological data.* PHILOSOPHY FROM THE JUNGLE In his Finding Philosophy in Social Science, the dis- tinguished philosopher of science Mario Bunge ar- gues that philosophy can help to bring clarity, depth, unity, and insight to the social sciences. He main- tains that, by providing a more complete and sys- tematic understanding of the nature of scientific reasoning, philosophy can expose inconsistencies between theory and practice and demonstrate that some conclusions researchers envisage are errone- ous or irrelevant.' Archaeology is the only disci- pline that seeks to study human behavior and thought without having any direct contact with either. Instead archaeologists must infer what they seek to study from the material remains of the past.2 The handicap of having to function under such a severe limitation makes it especially important that archaeologists understand how interpretation in the social sciences works. In today's postmodern intellectual environment, archaeologists also find themselves increasingly chal- lenged to pay attention to philosophical concepts such as subjectivism, conventionalism, fictionism, constructivism, relativism, and hermeneutics, which in the past they might have dismissed as inconse- quential. Yet few archaeologists have the time or in- clination to acquire a detailed understanding of these concepts, let alone to view them within the broader context of philosophical thought. One re- sult of this is a tendency, recently described by Chris- topher Chippindale, for archaeologists to treat such ideas as if they were novelty items in an intellectual hypermarket. Exotic concepts are picked up, toyed with, and soon discarded, with little serious effort being made to evaluate them or determine their long- * This article is a much revised version of the 1997 "Con- text and Human Society" lecture series, delivered at Boston University on 24-29 February 1997.

This problem is evident with the current vogue for ideal- ist philosophy. This article documents, as one of its arguments, how an idealist approach, if used judi- ciously, can enhance archaeological understanding and greatly assist the development of archaeologi- cal method and theory but, if employed uncritically, can encourage destructive and unwarranted forms of intellectual nihilism. Since most archaeologists have neither the time nor the specialized training to become professional philosophers, there is a need to develop a lingua franca that can help to bridge the serious divide in outlook between these two disciplines. In this article I concentrate on the value to ar- chaeology of one of the most important branches of philosophy, epistemology. Epistemology, or the theory of knowledge, is concerned with understand- ing the nature and validity of human knowledge. Epistemologists investigate how knowledge is ac- quired, the varying degrees of certainty and prob- ability in knowledge, and the difference between knowledge (with some level of certainty) and belief (without being certain). For the last two millennia, the two competing epistemological orientations have been rationalism, which stresses the role of reason- ing in providing certainty, and empiricism, which emphasizes the role of sense perception. Today epis- temologies tend to be classified in terms of three alternative schools or approaches: positivism, ideal- ism, and realism.5 Because epistemological questions are a central concern of theoretical archaeology, sometimes called metaarchaeology, it is important to investigate the problems that archaeologists encounter in trying to apply these approaches in their work. It is also clear that the problems that archaeologists must deal with in interpreting their data are of no less interest to philosophers studying epistemology than epistem- ological findings are to archaeologists.6 I limit this study, however, to examining the use that archae- ologists make, or could make, of epistemological concepts. A more specific aim of this article is to consider why archaeologists have a difficult time try- ing to understand philosophical arguments and how they can overcome these problems and use epistem- ological concepts more critically and productively to interpret their data. Historical Background It is widely assumed that archaeologists did not make significant use of philosophical concepts prior to the new or processual archaeologists embracing the ideas of Carl Hempel in the 1960s.7 In fact, a considerably more profound encounter took place three decades earlier in classical archaeology, a branch of the discipline that prehistoric or anthro- pological archaeologists often erroneously assume lacks intellectual profundity, and during a period when culture-historical archaeology, another form of archaeology currently believed to have been wholly atheoretical, was dominant. This encounter occurred under the most favorable circumstances in the person of the Oxford academic, Robin Col- lingwood, who was simultaneously a leading classi- cal archaeologist and one of the most distinguished British philosophers of his time. Collingwood was perhaps the first philosopher who viewed efforts to understand the past as a testing ground for inves- tigating the nature of thought in general and hence as a basis for philosophical enquiry. Beginning in 1911, he concentrated on archaeological studies that made him the leading authority on Roman Britain. This work culminated in his definitive study The Ar- chaeology of Roman Britain, published in 1930. After that time, he produced his most important philo- sophical work, The Idea ofHistory, which was published posthumously in 1946. A briefer and more access- ible exposition of his philosophical ideas is avail- C.

He believed that even the simplest perceptions make sense only as the re- sult of concepts, or categories, that already exist in the human mind. Individuals cannot perceive or make sense of the world independently of their existing understanding of the nature of things. Many of these concepts are learned, but others, such as basic notions of time, space, and causality, appear to be innate. Whatever the origin of these concepts, without them the observations that constitute the basis of a positivist epistemology would remain meaningless. For Collingwood, the past that the archaeologist studies is not a dead past, but one that exists entirely in the present. All that we know about the past comes from texts and artifacts that exist in the modern world, together with knowledge that we believe is relevant to understanding the past when applied to this material.9 Collingwood's idealism also led him to deny that facts and theories are distinct from one another. Archaeologists, he argued, only per- ceive what they are conditioned to look for and noth- ing acquires meaning except in relation to clearly formulated questions that the archaeologist poses."' As an idealist, Collingwood also maintained that, because what is real to people is only what exists in their minds, archaeologists must seek to under- stand the past by determining in their minds the intentions, goals, and knowledge that motivated the behavior of the people being studied. Archae- ologists must attempt to replicate the ideas that caused people to make and do things in particular ways in the past. Archaeological interpretation there- fore consists of the ideas that modern archaeologists have about the ideas that people once had, and is an activity in which a scholar seeks to relive the past in her or his own mind. Only by seeking to recon- struct the mental activities that shaped events, and by rethinking the past in terms of their own expe- riences, can archaeologists discern the significant patterns and dynamics of ancient cultures." To do this adequately, however, archaeologists must try to expand their own consciousness by seek- ing to learn as much as possible about variations in human behavior and about specific ancient cul- tures from literary sources. There is no evidence that Collingwood viewed social anthropology as a useful source of information about variations in human behavior, although this would have been a produc- tive way for him to expand his awareness of such diversity. Instead, his classical bias led him to use the written records of ancient Greece and Rome to become more aware of the thoughts and practices of those civilizations that were distinct from those of modern ones and which helped place the past on a different plane from the present by contradict- ing the archaeologist's conventional beliefs.12 Col- lingwood did not believe that such understanding would provide the basis for a definitive knowledge of the past. For him the most that was possible was an imagining of the past that the archaeologist might hope approximated the understanding held by the people who had lived in the past. Working within the confines of the classical tradition, Collingwood seems to have been unaware of the dangers of eth- nocentrism involved in this process. Many British archaeologists of the 1940s and 1950s read Collingwood, or at least became generally fa- miliar with his ideas. Yet most of them knew little about philosophy and were culturally predisposed toward some form of naive positivism or empiri- cism. That led archaeologists such as Glyn Daniel, Stuart Piggott, and Christopher Hawkes to interpret Collingwood's ideas along lines that in some respects were very different from what Collingwood had in- tended.1 Like Collingwood, they accorded ideas a major role in shaping human behavior, but, unlike him, they drew a clear distinction between facts and interpretations. They believed that archaeological data constituted the real and cumulative core of the discipline. Interpretations, on the other hand, were matters of opinion that had little lasting importance. R.G.

TRIGGER [AJA 102 It was argued that, since the past no longer exists, there was no possibility of comparing inferences about the past with the actual events to establish if the inferences were correct. Because of the complex- ity of human phenomena, varying interpretations were possible and these were influenced to a con- siderable degree by the various standpoints or be- liefs of individual archaeologists. Moreover, because material culture reflects only a limited spectrum of human behavior and only a small amount of mate- rial culture survives in the archaeological record, interpretations are shaped as much by the assump- tions of the archaeologist as by archaeological evidence. Archaeological interpretation is therefore heav- ily influenced by intellectual fashions and all under- standings of the past are eventually undermined by new data and new explanatory fads. This position, which had much in common with the views of con- temporary historians who followed the example of the great 19th-century German empirical historian Leopold von Ranke, combined extreme skepticism regarding the objectivity and lasting value of inter- pretations with unquestioning faith in the objectiv- ity of archaeological finds.4" Not being sufficiently familiar with contemporary philosophy, leading ar- chaeologists understood Collingwood in some re- spects to mean the exact opposite from what he had intended. This discrepancy illustrates one of the problems that chronically troubles archaeologists' efforts to use philosophical concepts. Use of Philosophical Concepts by Archaeologists Any sort of interdisciplinary dialogue is difficult, especially if the analytical approaches of the disci- plines involved are very different. For various his- torical and intellectual reasons, it is considerably harder for archaeologists and philosophers to under- stand the general approach and underlying assump- tions of each other's field than it is for archaeolo- gists to understand palaeontology, historical geology, or cosmogony. The latter are all historical disciplines and to that extent share many basic assumptions and methods. Philosophy and archaeology lack a simi- lar, extensive common ground. Making philosophy comprehensible to archaeologists, so that archae- ologists can apply its findings critically in their work, requires a systematic understanding of the basic ways in which these disciplines differ from each other. In my opinion, an important key to such understand- ing lies in their respective attitude toward evolution. Philosophy is an old discipline, long antedating any generally accepted concept of evolution. In the medieval university the term philosophy covered all fields of knowledge except theology and perhaps medicine. Since then the sciences have split off, leav- ing philosophy concerned with such matters as the nature of logic, reality, perceptions, and values. Each of these fields represents traditions of thought that can be traced back without interruption to classical Greece.15 Much of philosophical scholarship ap- pears, at least to outsiders, to consist of commen- taries on, and updatings of, the work of earlier phi- losophers or the issues they raised. The concept of sociocultural evolution was forged by the philosophers of the Enlightenment. Yet, while they believed in technological, social, and moral pro- gress, they also thought that progress came about as a result, not of human nature changing, but of its less desirable features being subjected to greater public control and individual self-discipline.16 The still earlier social-contract philosophers may look like evolutionists, but their accounts of individuals agreeing to form societies were in reality 17th- and 18th-century secular myths (or revivals of classical speculations) that sought to reassess the relations between society and the individual. For Thomas Hobbes the state was required to curb the violence and brutality inherent in human nature. For Jean- Jacques Rousseau society was an expression of hu- man sociability and goodness (albeit these were char- acteristics that he thought were easily corrupted as society became more complex). ForJohn Locke au- thority was an expedient to create an orderly social environment in which individuals, who were innately neither especially good nor bad but highly suscep- tible to social conditioning, might seek to better themselves.17 Today the post-Enlightenment romantic philos- opher Georg Hegel may look superficially like an evolutionist but, since the spiritual self-realization that was his end point of human development rep- resented a return to the Absolute or All that had negated itself to constitute the particularity and '4 E.H.

While Hegelian philosophy's holis- tic emphasis on viewing parts in relation to larger wholes is a valuable challenge to examine issues from a contextual perspective, no clear-cut methodology has been created for implementing this approach. As a result, methodological holism has tended to encourage the dangerous belief that intuition alone can supply complete and final truths.'18 If modern philosophers display at best only a luke- warm interest in sociocultural evolution, they ap- pear to be even less concerned with biological evo- lution as it relates to human origins. Their main interest remains, as in the past, to consider how people as they currently are known behave or ought to behave. For them it makes little difference whether human beings were created essentially as they are today or evolved from some behaviorally less com- plex primate ancestor. A similar disinterest pervades disciplines such as economics, political science, so- ciology, and history, which are concerned mainly with human behavior in the present and recent past. Most linguists see the need to relate the origins of language to biological evolution, but there are ex- ceptions, such as Noam Chomsky, who views lan- guage in essentially creationist terms as a phenom- enon that transcends biological evolution.19 Most archaeologists, however, and especially pre- historic archaeologists, are trained to think about human origins in relation to biological evolution. As a result, they naturally incline to view different aspects of human behavior in terms of how these developed. This is very different from the philos- ophers' older tradition of trying to understand hu- man beings as they are now. As a result, archaeol- ogists and philosophers find themselves discussing the same issues in what often turn out to be mutu- ally incomprehensible languages. This incomprehensibility has an impact on epis- temology. A positivist approach maintains that the task of science is to explain what is evident to the senses. The 18th-century philosopher David Hume, the first systematic exponent of positivism, by reject- ing anything that could not be perceived by the senses as an object of discourse, sought to remove appeals to God and Providence from the realm of scientific discussion. The rules that he established also, however, compelled him to eliminate the con- cept of causality, which he nevertheless recognized was essential for the conduct of everyday life. In positivist epistemology, explanation takes the form of establishing regularities between different classes of observable phenomena and trying to group these to form more general patterns. This has en- couraged a behavioral approach in the social sci- ences, since it favors what can be directly witnessed at the expense of investigating more elusive thoughts and motives. It also privileges methodological in- dividualism and calls into question the usefulness of concepts such as society on the same grounds as it does causality; people are real because they are entities that can be observed but society is only a construct. A positivist epistemology is also invoked as a reason for not studying macroeconomic pro- cesses.20 As a result of positivism's doubts about the epistemological validity of emergent qualities, it tends to be reductionist: its ideal is to explain social phenomena at the biological level and biological phenomena in turn at the physical level. It likewise promotes a belief in "unified science," which main- tains that the same scientific approach applies re- gardless of the nature of what is being studied. In practice that means that the methodology pioneered for studying physics is held to provide a model for the social sciences.2' At the other extreme is idealism, which we have already encountered in the philosophy of Colling- wood. Idealism, which traces its modern origins to the writings of the 18th-century German philoso- pher Immanuel Kant, maintains that perception is shaped by the concepts that each individual uses to interpret sensory data. In contrast to the positiv- ists, who treat sensory data as givens, epistemolog- ical idealists maintain that perceptions only acquire meaning as a result of selection and classification that go on in the observer's mind. Some of the cate- gories that interpret sensory data are learned, others are biologically innate. The latter may include the capacity for forming concepts, such as those of causality, time, and space, as well as the neural struc- tures that facilitate the learning of languages. How- ever differently such abilities are culturally elabo- rated, they appear to be based on substrates that i C.

TRIGGER [AJA 102 are panhuman and essential for any individual to function normally. Idealists therefore maintain that concepts play an important role in determining per- ception. Human beings do not adjust to the world as it really is, but to the world as they imagine it to be. Because of this orientation, idealism encourages a cultural rather than a behavioral approach to the study of human activities. It also promotes an inter- est in relativism and subjectivism and, in extreme forms, claims that there is not only no way to know what reality is like but also no way to know how any- one else perceives or feels about anything. The cur- rent expression of this belief is the postmodern slo- gan that every decoding is another encoding.22 The third major epistemology and the most re- cent is realism. It identifies the object of scientific study as being not only what can be perceived with the senses or conceptualized in the brain, but all things that exist and are worth examining because they are capable of changing in some respect. Ideas, far from being autonomous, are viewed as processes that occur in the brains of some creatures and hence can be studied from a materialistic perspective. But realists also maintain that some imperceptible en- tities, either processes or phenomena that are pres- ently unobservable, are appropriate objects for sci- entific investigation even if they can be known only conceptually. Realists thus do not confine themselves to appearances, as positivists seek to do, but they also do not join with idealists in belittling the sig- nificance of appearances. Often they start from ap- pearances and try to explain them in terms of im- perceptible entities and processes. In studying the social sciences, realism seeks to embrace both the objective and the subjective. Because it accepts the scientific validity of studying structures as well as the entities that compose structures, realism is anti- reductionist and embraces a view of science that takes account of the need for employing differ- ent modes of inquiry to study different kinds of phenomena.23 Over the past 40 years archaeologists have in- voked each of these three epistemologies as a basis, or a rationalization, for their interpretation and explanation of archaeological data. In the 1960s processual archaeologists adopted a positivist ap- proach as the basis for what they called an explicitly scientific research program. Following the early work of Hempel, they insisted that interpretive hy- potheses should be rigorously tested following a deductive-nomological model of confirmation. This involved a "covering law" approach that required every explanation to incorporate the statement of a universal law and to demonstrate that a specific event could be subsumed under that law.24 Hempel insisted that explanations of human behavior and physical events were formally similar and hence both could be accounted for in this manner. Alternative epistemologies were generally ig- nored, as were warnings that the Hempelian model had already been substantially undermined by philo- sophical critiques and by its failure to account for the progress being made in the physical and biolog- ical sciences, where models that could not initially be tested by direct evidence frequently turned out to be verifiable in the long run and much progress was made by the haphazard accumulation of sepa- rate generalizations. As a result of these experiences, it was concluded that a rigid adherence to positivist methodology would impede rather than enhance the development of scientific understanding.25 While some philosophers and archaeologists con- tinue to defend a positivist approach, even many of these have sought to adapt it to the complexity and messiness of human behavior by advocating a statistical-relevance model of explanation in place of a deductive-nomological one.26 Explanations are based on statistically significant correlations instead of only on those that are absolutely certain. How- ever, abandoning perfect correlations between specific forms of behavior and material culture in the modern world as a basis for inferring behavior from material culture in the archaeological record creates uncertainties that were not envisaged by the 22 E.C.

Still other archaeologists, such as Guy Gibbon, have advocated a realist approach to archaeological interpretation,27 while many others, as a result of the impact of postmodernism on the social sciences generally, once again have embraced various forms of idealist epistemology.28 Others seek to avoid epis- temological commitments by championing a prag- matic approach, which maintains that explanations are simply answers to why-questions and that a theory should be evaluated on the basis of its relative ex- planatory power when tested against competing the- ories in specific situations.29 Still others assume that a positivist and behaviorist approach is best suited for explaining ecological adaptation, while an ideal- ist approach is more appropriate for the analysis of religious and other cognitive phenomena.30 Fi- nally, Bunge maintains that all reasonable and pro- ductive scientists are scientific realists in practice, whatever epistemology they advocate.31 Archaeologists find it challenging to sort out these epistemologies and establish their relevance for their work. A graduate student from East Asia who took my seminar on the philosophical foundations of ar- chaeology a few years ago announced, following the section on epistemology, that until then he had al- ways regarded Westerners as sensible and pragmatic, but now he was convinced that they were raving lu- natics. It is obvious that each epistemology privileges a different aspect of reality: realism, the world as it exists whether or not we can perceive it; positiv- ism, the evidence of the senses; and idealism, the world as we conceive of it. For archaeologists the ob- vious question is whether there is some higher level at which these competing approaches to understand- ing fit together. Exploring that question requires either getting involved in ongoing, often highly convoluted, debates in philosophy or setting these concepts into a framework that archaeologists can relate to more easily. I follow the latter course by considering how these concepts relate to one an- other when viewed from the perspective of biolog- ical evolution. The following sketch, which is a simple exercise in trying to ground philosophy in the realities of primate life, is not intended as an espousal of sociobiology or an attempt at biological reductionism. An Evolutionary Approach to Epistemology To adopt a biological evolutionary perspective is to accept the proposition that selection is a pro- cess that enables individual organisms that are bet- ter adapted to their environment to reproduce more successfully than competitors and hence avoid the extinction of their lineages. Human behavior, how- ever special it may be and however determined in its specificity by learning, is the outcome of natural selection acting upon a particular primate lineage. Among the products of natural selection is the bio- logical basis for those conceptual and behavioral patterns that all modern humans share as members of the same species.32 Since philosophy is rooted in human experience, philosophy and the study of hu- man evolution must have a considerable amount in common, even if this correspondence is not recog- nized by philosophers. This overlap constitutes a solid justification for adopting an evolutionary ap- proach to understanding epistemology. Let us begin with a tree shrew-like ancestor of hu- manity living some 65 million years ago. This ple- siadapid did not have the intelligence to be a phi- losopher or an archaeologist, but it did live in a real world and, like us, had to adapt to that world if its body and whatever passed for its mind were to sur- vive. The requirement of having to live in a real world, whether we wish to or not, validates many of the perspectives offered by a realist epistemol- ogy. Early primates survived because they were ad- equately adapted to preying on insects from the tree branches of tropical forests. This adaptation re- quired them to have excellent paw-eye coordination and to be expert jumpers, able to calculate whether it was possible to jump from one branch of a tree to another and how much energy had to be put into each jump for it to be successful.

But even the early pri- mate had to have some mechanism built into its brain for using that sensory information (although prob- ably not in any form that we could recognize em- pathetically) to decide what acrobatics were appro- priate. This mechanism must have involved at least a rudimentary ability to conceptualize time, space, and cause and effect relations. In other words, prim- itive as the plesiadapid's brain may have been, some process was occurring inside it that was analogous to what in the case of human beings provides the point of departure for an idealist epistemology. In the course of higher primate evolution there has been a tendency for instinctive behavior to be replaced by learned behavior. Learned behavior has numerous adaptive advantages, but requires the de- velopment of more elaborate forms for processing and communicating knowledge. All these character- istics grew increasingly prominent as social life be- came more complex and important for adaptation and as body size increased. At some undetermined phase in hominid development, the capacity for sym- bolic manipulation reached the level where individ- uals could begin to objectify themselves, build ex- plicit models of what went on in the minds of others, and by imagining alternative scenarios relate socially in ever more intricate and subtle ways. The likeli- hood that the major selective factor encouraging the development of brains able to perform such intri- cate adaptive tasks was a social one is suggested by the fact that modern humans are still better able to conduct relations within the context of small rather than large groups and better able to devise strategies for the short term than for the long one." The uniformity of the early hominid world lay not in the natural environmental settings in which they lived, which would have become increasingly varied as they expanded geographically. It lay in their all living in small groups and employing simple tech- nologies. These were the most important and per- vasive conditions to which natural selection would have slowly adapted them. Although human beings are both cooperative and competitive, even within small groups, the enhancement of cooperative be- havior played an important role in ensuring human survival.34 It is not by accident that the human cere- bral cortex, which is associated with the capacity to reason, is anatomically linked to the limbic system, the seat of the emotions.5 A close connection be- tween affect and reason is essential if the capacity for reason is to serve social ends. But symbolic capacities enhanced not only social relations. Human beings simultaneously developed the means to perceive the biological and physical world in symbolic as well as sensual terms. As a re- sult human beings, as Gordon Childe observed, do not adapt to the real world but to the world as their society imagines it to be.36 As a consequence of bio- logical evolution, the human mind has developed to the point that all relations, including those be- tween humans and the natural world, are mediated by concepts that are transmitted by learning from one generation to the next, while at the same time these concepts are capable of rapid modification in ways that instinctive behavior is not. Human in- fants are born into the world with certain basic ca- pacities wired into their brains, such as the ability to form concepts of time, space, and causality and to learn languages. Yet everything they need to know to adapt to society and the natural world must be slowly learned. This observation attests to the im- portance of the human mind, but is not an endorse- ment of idealism. While Childe noted that humans adapt to a symbolic world rather than to the real one, he cautioned that this symbolic world had to correspond to the real one to a very considerable degree if a society was to survive.37 Since individ- uals and cultures do tend to survive, and human beings, for better or for worse, have been able to penetrate every portion of the earth and dominate the planetary ecosystem, it is evident that cultural systems possess considerable capacity for promot- ing realist behavior. The speed with which cultural change can occur renders humans capable of adapting to quickly changing situations, but also enhances the possibil- ity for the rapid spread of maladaptive patterns of behavior. As societies become more complex and the tempo of sociocultural change increases, there is growing danger that ideas that have been inad- 3 R. Boyd and P.J.

What began as a more efficient general mode of adap- tation could, as it becomes more successful, also be- come increasingly dangerous.38 Yet, to the extent that individuals can observe the erroneous, dysfunc- tional, or counterproductive nature of what they be- lieve, they may be able to modify their ideas. Such discrepancies can be noted when other people are observed to behave differently from how an indi- vidual expected them to act. Similarly, the natural world does not always behave the way people believe it does and plans may not work out as those who formulated them hoped they would. In these cases, sensory perception plays an important role in help- ing to adjust perceptions to reality. It is therefore obvious that positivist, idealist, and realist episte- mologies are not alternative explanations, but ac- count for various aspects of human behavior in ways that complement one another. An idealist episte- mology generalizes the everyday processes by which human beings deal with each other; a positivist one generalizes the way in which humans cope with the natural world; and a realist one takes account of the selective processes acting on all forms of human behavior. This view is very different from the widely held opinion that idealism and positivism constitute op- posed and mutually irreconcilable epistemologies that are naturally linked to radically different po- litical options. Idealism is often portrayed by its foes as the preferred worldview of romantic reactionaries and by its supporters as the chief bulwark protect- ing individual dignity and cultural diversity."9 Pos- itivism is construed by its detractors as the preferred epistemology of technocrats and the middle-class establishment, who are anxious to dehumanize the people they exploit.4" There may be some super- ficial truth to all these caricatures, but such associa- tions are not inherent in the epistemologies. The Polish philosopher Leszek Kolakowski specifically has refuted the charge made by Herbert Marcuse and others that positivism, with its emphasis on ob- servations rather than on values, has played a spe- cial role in rationalizing economic exploitation and political oppression. He also demonstrated that, far from developing as a reflection of capitalist values, British positivism, which he associates with the be- ginnings of modern science, democratic legislation, and universal human rights, can be traced as far back as Roger Bacon in the 13th century.41 Neither idealism nor positivism can be held re- sponsible for the political wrongdoings of modern times. A far more important and intrinsic difference between positivist and idealist approaches is that subjective data, relating to individual feelings, per- ceptions, and desires, which are the special concern of an idealist epistemology, are inadmissible in the natural sciences, whereas they are not only admis- sible but indispensable in psychology and the social sciences. In these disciplines they complement data derived from the objective observation of behav- ior.42 Philosophers might have avoided much need- less and misleading debate about how human be- havior can be studied and understood had they taken more account of what has been learned over the past 140 years about primate evolution, human psychol- ogy, and the process of socialization. Different aspects of human behavior have to be studied in different ways. Other people's beliefs, mo- tivations, and feelings must be inferred, as they are constantly in the course of daily life, by a process of sympathetic understanding that already in the 19th century German social scientists referred to as verstehen.4 Verstehen involves trying to construct in our own minds how other people view things based on how we ourselves do, and constantly com- paring our own and other people's reactions to specific situations in order to adjust, update, and refine our understandings. Even in the most famil- iar social settings, most people encounter a consid- erable range of behavior and attitudes that reflect differences in age, gender, social position, occupa- tion, and individual personality. For dealing with other cultures, a still broader range of knowledge is required. It is evident that sympathetic understand- ing does not constitute certain evidence of how others perceive and feel about specific matters, but 38 Boyd and Richerson (supra n. 33) 278-79. 9 Bunge (supra n. 1) 283; H.

TRIGGER [AJA 102 only hypotheses. These hypotheses may be checked in living societies by detailed discussions with people about their beliefs or observing to what extent people behave as we imagine they should. The utility of such tests is limited, however, by people not always ex- pressing or acting upon some of their most deeply held beliefs. In some situations they go to great lengths to conceal them. When it comes to some of the more obvious adap- tations to the material world, such as hunting strat- egies or the management of irrigation systems, ar- chaeologists, lacking any direct ways to investigate beliefs and motivations, frequently decide to ignore beliefs and model people's behavior in relation to the environment in rational ecological terms.44 This decision may cause archaeologists to overlook inter- esting sorts of information, such as whether hunt- ers in a particular culture regarded killing animals as proof of their personal resourcefulness and cour- age or interpreted it as evidence of their effective spiritual relations with animals, which led some of these animals to sacrifice their lives to help hu- mans.45 It has also long been recognized that metal- lurgy has been influenced by ritual, magical, and aesthetic as well as purely technological considera- tions.46 When no reliable information concerning beliefs is available, a rationalist behavioral approach may be all that is possible. While in order to survive, all societies must pos- sess an understanding that permits their people to cope with the environment, that understanding, as we have already suggested, can be encoded in many different ways, and may change as the nature of so- ciety changes. An industrial society is likely to en- code its understanding of how the environment works in terms of an ecosystemic model, while hunter-gatherers are more likely to interpret it from a religious perspective.47 To dismiss such differ- ences as epiphenomenal not only underestimates the extent of cultural variation, but also may fail to recognize systematic differences between various types of societies. Archaeologists must therefore re- sist the temptation to claim that whatever they can- not study using archaeological data alone, or any ideas about adaptation that do not conform to mod- ern Western ideas about ecological adaptation, are not of scientific interest. Something resembling an idealist perspective is necessary to understand why people perceived the need to behave as they did, while a behaviorist or ecological approach will shed light on the physical constraints that encouraged, or even required, people to behave in a particular way. Yet, because human behavior cannot exist apart from belief, the study of one is complementary to the other. A com- plete explanation of human behavior must take ac- count of what human beings believe about their so- cial and natural environment, what that environment actually is like, how people's ideas are modified by sensory observations, especially as they seek to act upon the environment, and finally how actions mod- ify the environment. This sort of project draws upon, curbs, and unifies the insights derived from apply- ing idealist, positivist, and realist epistemologies, but in its totality it most closely approximates a realist position. I have not yet mentioned materialism because it is not an epistemological term, referring to how we know things, but an ontological one, relating to an understanding of the actual nature of things. Its op- posite, ontological idealism, in its most extreme form denies the existence of the material world, holding only ideas to be real. A less extreme version of on- tological idealism that is prevalent in the social sci- ences accepts the existence of the material world but asserts the autonomous existence and primacy of ideas.48 I find it difficult to imagine that anyone who acknowledges a biological evolutionary origin for the human species, and therefore accepts that the human body, including the human brain, has evolved as a particular form of adaptation to the material world, could be anything but a materialist. Yet, because of the strongly symbolic component in the ways that human beings adapt to the environ- ment, there is considerable disagreement about the relative importance of the role played by ideas and material factors in shaping human behavior. In this debate materialists treat ecological, economic, and 44 S.J. Mithen, Thoughtful Foragers (Cambridge 1990). 45 H.A. Feit, Waswanipi Realities and Adaptations (Diss. McGill University 1978); A.

For them, culture is merely an epi- phenomenon or a kind of computational device that reflects this adaptation and plays a relatively pas- sive, facilitating role. A classic expression of this view is Leslie White's dictum that "social systems are ... determined by technological systems, and philos- ophies and the arts express experience as it is defined by technology and refracted by social systems."'49 In other words, if we understand the material aspects of adaptation, we can predict the general nature of society and culture. On the other hand, many people believe that ideas play a major role in shaping the operation and evo- lution of cultures. For the most part, these ideas are transmitted from one generation to the next in the form of cultural traditions. This view does not rule out a materialist understanding of change, if it is also accepted that symbolic manipulation has evolved, and functions, as a means of adapting in- dividuals and groups to their natural and social en- vironment. Indeed, Boyd and Richerson have dem- onstrated that ideas that have been tested for their social efficacy over long periods generally are less disruptive and serve the interests of society better than do recent innovations, which tend to serve in- dividual interests.50 More strongly committed ideal- ists tend to ignore the adaptive nature of ideas and view them alone as constituting the reality that shapes human behavior. They attribute relatively little significance to external constraints as factors shaping human behavior. Carried to an extreme, idealism results in a cultural determinism that is as unrealistic as ecological determinism and, in addi- tion, is wholly incapable of explaining sociocultural change.51 The understanding of symbols as an independent adaptive force was greatly enhanced when, in the early 1980s, on the basis of a series of brief ethno- archaeological studies carried out in various parts of Africa, Ian Hodder was able to demonstrate that, apart from its technological significance, material culture could be used to disguise and invert social relations, as well as to reflect and reinforce them.52 This discovery definitively killed the notion that sym- bolic aspects of culture merely reflect economic and social relations. Yet it did not call into question the proposition that culture had evolved as an adaptive strategy. It merely indicated that the flexibility of culture results in spears and calabashes of different designs reflecting the tensions and struggles, as well as the integrative tendencies, in human societies. As an emergent property, culture has transformed human behavior to the point that the symbolic rep- resentations that human societies create mediate all forms of human behavior. Because the primary pur- pose of symbolic representation is adaptive, its ca- pacity to generate an almost infinite variety of ideas must be curbed if culture is to be meaningful, and hence useful, to those whose behavior is guided by it. The self-ordering structural properties of culture are, as Ernest Gellner pointed out, very different from humanity's relation to the natural world, which is ordered by the scarcity of material resources and of the energy needed to utilize them.5" These prop- erties are most spectacularly evident in the realm of language. Despite the totally arbitrary relations between phonemes, morphemes, and grammatical principles, on the one hand, and meaning, on the other, historical linguists have demonstrated remark- able internal consistency in the manner in which these features of language change, to the extent that "a good etymology depends not on phonetic similarity, but on phonetically regular patterns of correspondence."54 It appears that in other cultural realms, to the ex- tent that external factors play a less important role in constraining human behavior, this ordering must be provided by structures that are inherent in cul- ture itself. The aesthetic principles underlying Clas- sical Greek sculpture constitute no less an example of regularity in human behavior than does the most solidly established cross-cultural generalization.55 Mediating between the real world and the human understanding of it is the realm of perception.

If this could not happen, culture would not be adaptive. Without successful adaptation, which in the case of humans is simultaneously symbolic and material, there would be no human bodies, and without human bodies there would be no human minds. This I submit is the essence of an understand- ing that is materialist and takes account of cognitive phenomena. The archaeological record is a prod- uct of human behavior that was shaped with varying degrees of directness by material constraints, as these were comprehended in terms of culturally condi- tioned understandings of reality. THE REAL, THE PERCEIVED, AND THE IMAGINED Neoevolutionism and Processual Archaeology The processual archaeologists of the 1960s and 1970s chose to utilize a very narrow spectrum of epis- temological options, which accorded with a view of human behavior that has not withstood the test of trying to explain the full range of archaeological data. Processual archaeology was based on a joint commitment to neoevolutionism and ecological determinism. For several decades the anthropolo- gists Leslie White and Julian Steward had inter- preted the idea that cultures were adaptive systems to mean that individual sociocultural systems, either in their entirety or at least in terms of their most significant features, were shaped by the material re- quirements of their adaptation, which could be mea- sured in terms of energy flows within cultural sys- tems and between those systems and the natural environment. They further maintained that human consciousness, in the form of beliefs and values, was shaped by adaptive requirements, thereby minimiz- ing, or even ignoring, the role that existing beliefs and human agency played in bringing about socio- cultural change.56 Central to the new project was the idea that cul- tural variation was limited and that its essential fea- tures could be summarized in terms of a unilinear series of stages of development, most commonly com- posed of bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and states. While neoevolutionary anthropologists, such as Marshall Sahlins, Elman Service, and Morton Fried, did not rule out variations arising as a result of cultures hav- ing to adapt to specific environments, they firmly believed that significant sociocultural variation could be understood in terms of a limited number of types.57 The archaeologist William Sanders and his associates hoped that 80% of variation in prehistoric settlement patterns in the Valley of Mexico might be explained in terms of four or five ecological vari- ables. When they analyzed their findings, the amount turned out to be much lower.58 The ideas of White and Steward were applied to prehistoric archaeology by Lewis Binford and his followers in the 1960s.59 They assumed that, if hu- man behavior were highly regular, it would be rel- atively easy, by establishing correlations between ma- terial culture and behavior in living societies, to discover a series of regularities that would permit them to interpret the archaeological record in be- havioral terms. They further argued that, since ma- terial culture was influenced by all aspects of hu- man behavior and all aspects of sociocultural systems were adaptive, it should be as easy to infer past be- havior relating to the ideological and social subsys- tems as it was to infer that relating to the economy. Thus Binford advocated a massive program of ethno- archaeological research that it was hoped, by estab- lishing invariant relations between behavior and ma- terial culture in living societies, soon would produce the generalizations that were required to read all sorts of behavioral meaning into the archaeological record.61 His own research among the Nunamiut Eskimos of northern Alaska was intended to pro- vide information about regularities in the spatial behavior of big-game hunting peoples.61 Processual archaeology accorded closely with the philosophical and social concerns of the 1960s. It was grounded in a very specific ontology, which maintained that sociocultural systems were shaped directly and rationally as the means for adapting - White (supra n. 49); J.H.

This accorded with the non-Marxist materialism that was popular in the United States during this period of unparalleled economic prosperity. Second, the ap- proach adopted by Binford and his followers was, like most of the social science of the 1960s, strongly behaviorist in orientation. Beliefs, and culture gen- erally, were treated as by-products of human activ- ity the main function of which was to facilitate adap- tation. Binford maintained that any attempt to infer the psychology and beliefs of prehistoric humans using archaeological evidence alone was doomed to failure and, for this reason as well, dismissed efforts to understand archaeological data from a cul- turally specific viewpoint.62 Processual archaeologists strongly privileged the study of human behavior over the study of beliefs; this point must be kept in mind in assessing Binford's claim that, if archaeologists only tried, they could learn as much about the ideological subsystems of cultures, which include religion, as they had about their economies.63 This behavioral bias naturally predisposed processual archaeologists, like most so- cial scientists of that period, to favor a positivist epis- temology. It was believed that, if archaeologists could establish generalizations about human behavior, like other social scientists they could provide govern- ments and the private sector with information that would be useful for public control and manipula- tion.64 This would ensure archaeology an honored position in a society in which "technological effi- ciency is regarded as the highest value" and justify continued public support for archaeological re- search.65 A positivist approach also enhanced the scientific credentials of archaeological findings by endowing them with an aura of ethical neutrality, which was highly valued at that time. Above all, in embracing a Hempelian nomological- deductive approach, Binford was seeking an epis- temological rationalization for his assumptions about the nature of sociocultural systems. It is evi- dence of the continuing philosophical naivete of most archaeologists in the 1960s that no effort was made to assess Hempel's position in relation to the philosophical debates of the period. Nor was much attention paid to the problems with Hempel's posi- tion that were drawn to archaeologists' attention in the few critiques of Binford's ideas that were pub- lished.66 Both friends and foes of the New Archaeol- ogy seemed prepared to treat Hempel's views as philosophy's last word on epistemology. Archaeol- ogists generally accepted what they were told phi- losophers believed. It also went unnoticed by archaeologists at the time, or, if noted, was dismissed as nothing more than an indication of social anthropology's back- wardness, that, while a number of social anthropol- ogists were vociferously promoting neoevolutionism, they never constituted more than a minority move- ment in that branch of anthropology. It was also a minority movement that peaked in the 1960s and then quickly declined in relative importance. Neo- evolutionism flourished at a time when cultural studies were in disarray in anthropology.67 The cul- ture and personality approach, which had dominated Boasian anthropology in the 1940s and 1950s, no longer attracted social anthropologists and it was not until the 1970s that structuralism and later post- structuralism revived an interest in beliefs rather than behavior. That neoevolution did not fare better among so- cial anthropologists in the 1960s was the result, not of their lack of theoretical sophistication, but of their realization that cultural variation was much greater than would be the case if a neoevolutionary ontol- ogy applied. It is unfortunate that at this time cul- tural anthropologists did not criticize the neoevo- lutionist position more vigorously, preferring, it seems, to let it burn itself out. Nor were most archae- ologists, despite protestations to the contrary, suffi- ciently interested in social anthropology to compare the claims of neoevolutionists and processual archae- ologists with the ethnographic evidence of cultural variation. Neoevolutionary models of tribes and chiefdoms were based mainly on ethnographic evi- dence from the Pacific region, without any syste- matic effort being made to determine how similar or dissimilar societies at analogous levels were in 62 L.R.

Despite these weaknesses, processual archaeology made important and lasting contributions to the de- velopment of archaeology. By compelling archae- ologists to become more self-conscious, explicit, and critical about their methodologies, it challenged com- placency, and encouraged more sophisticated and productive research, which eventually resulted in archaeologists gaining deeper and more informed insights into what had happened in the past. Spec- ulation was replaced by efforts to test and verify inter- pretations. The development of middle-range theory, which sought systematically to infer human behav- ior from archaeological remains, gave archaeologists new confidence in their ability to contribute to the development of the social sciences.69 It is for these reasons that processual archaeology has influenced, in varying ways and to varying degrees, subsequent work done in all branches of archaeology. Postprocessual Counterpoint Beginning in the late 1970s, there was a grow- ing awareness among processual archaeologists of ontological weaknesses in their approach. Ethnoar- chaeological research continued to produce gen- eralizations that were useful for the behavioral inter- pretation of prehistoric technology, subsistence patterns, and other aspects of adaptation, but these were the same areas that archaeologists had ad- dressed most successfully prior to processual ar- chaeology.70 There was a greater awareness of di- versity in the archaeological record, which suggested that, if ecological adaptation had played a more im- portant role in shaping the archaeological record than Boasian-inspired culture-historical archaeol- ogists had acknowledged, cultural traditions, which might be no less adaptive, had played a more im- portant role than processual archaeologists had imagined. Furthermore, Hodder's ethnoarchaeolog- ical observations that material culture could disguise, distort, and invert, as well as reflect, social relations called into question processual archaeology's as- sumption that the ideological sphere was of only epiphenomenal significance. It was also observed increasingly frequently that the material remains of religious activities and be- lief systems bulked large in the archaeological record in the form of temples, tombs, and iconography.71 Over time interest grew in the symbolic as well as the social meaning of such remains. A tomb might (but did not necessarily) reflect the status of a dead person, or that person's family, and thus yield in- formation about social organization that has cross- cultural and evolutionary significance, as the early processual archaeologists had maintained. But the layout of a tomb and the material evidence of rit- uals carried out at the time of the burial might provide insights into culturally specific beliefs that many archaeologists were beginning to find no less interesting.72 Some processual archaeologists attempted to adapt their approach to a growing awareness of be- havioral diversity by assigning beliefs a more sig- nificant role in the regulation of social relations.73 Other archaeologists concluded that, while proces- sual archaeology had contributed significantly to a better understanding of ecological issues, it had erred in its ecological determinism and its denial of agency to human beings. Some began, along Marx- ist lines, to assign social conflict over material resources a greater role in bringing about social 68 M.D. Sahlins, Social Stratification in Polynesia (Seattle 1958); Service (supra n. 57). 69 L.R.

Since the late 1960s, I have taught an undergraduate course at McGill University on early civilizations in which students are each re- quired to write an essay on a topic of their own choos- ing. Throughout this period, I have tried to cover all aspects of early civilizations. Yet, in the 1960s, most papers were concerned with ecological, eco- nomic, and political issues. Today, more than 80% of the papers deal with religion and symbolism. This trend, I believe, reflects a broader shift in interest that has occurred both in society in general and in archaeology and anthropology in particular over the past 30 years. In the practice of archaeology, this transformation has taken the form of a rebellion against the taboos and restrictions of processual ar- chaeology that has been no less strident, confron- tational, and fueled by personal interest in career building than was processual archaeology's rebellion against culture-historical archaeology in the 1960s. The principal emphasis of the innovators has been on studying religion, cultural agency, and the hu- man mind.76 What is strikingly different is that postprocessualism is theoretically considerably less unified than processual archaeology was in its early days and does not have a single leader. This transformation has also affected relations be- tween archaeology and philosophy. Because these relations have become part of a broader set of inter- disciplinary connections linking philosophy, the so- cial sciences, and cultural studies, they are far more developed and sophisticated than were the limited, bilateral ties between archaeology and philosophy in the 1960s. They also have acquired more vocif- erous social and political dimensions. The repudiation of processual archaeology thus has become part of a more extensive, postmodern revolt against positivism and what is seen as the pro- duction of supposedly objective knowledge to serve the interests of the rich and powerful. The support- ers of a postmodern position maintain that there is no single true version of human affairs, but mul- tiple truths that are constructed from the varied standpoints of rich and poor, winners and losers, males and females, and different ethnic groups. Rad- icals seek, by encouraging the development of mul- tiple views of the past, to decenter and disempower what they characterize as hegemonic archaeology, and which they maintain serves the interests of the most privileged and conservative groups in society.77 This perspective has been inspired by the classi- cal Marxist view that knowledge is not neutral and objective, but reflects the particular understandings and vested interests of the people who create it as well as those of their public and private patrons. Such an interpretation initially reflected the mate- rialist belief that knowledge is created to help real- ize specific political and economic goals. It was main- tained that to understand why people propagate particular ideas, it is necessary to ascertain the goals that they are pursuing and the way in which their ideas relate to these goals. That requires deconstruc- tion: taking ideas apart and critically analyzing them to learn how, why, and by whom they were put to- gether. This approach was further developed and propagated, beginning in the 1920s, by the Frank- furt School within the general context of what is now called neo-Marxism. At the same time members of the Frankfurt School attributed increasing impor- tance to ideas themselves and less importance to ma- terial conditions as determinants of what people be- lieved. This shift came about as a result of their disillusionment with the seemingly irrational sup- port that the European working class had given to nationalism rather than class interest in the course of the First World War.78 The ideas of the Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who stressed the role of ideologies as support for resistance as well as hegemony, also have contributed to the de- velopment of critical analysis.79 Critical analysis provides an intellectual structure 74R.H.

TRIGGER [AJA 102 and rationalization for an interest-driven examina- tion of archaeological interpretation. At the same time the realization that archaeological interpreta- tions are subjective and influenced by the social mi- lieus in which archaeology is practiced has become much more widely accepted as a result of the study of the history of archaeology. That process began with Robert Silverberg's Mound Builders of Ancient America, in my opinion a much underrated book, which demonstrated how ideas about the so-called Mound Builders both reflected the 19th-century racism that was directed against aboriginal Amer- icans and in turn reinforced that racism.80 Through- out much of the 19th century it had been widely be- lieved by archaeologists and the general public that the complexes of mounds being found throughout the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys were the work of a more civilized people who had eventually been replaced, driven out, or exterminated by the ances- tors of the "savage" Indian tribes who had inhabited that region in historical times. It was not until the late 19th century that archaeological research clearly demonstrated that these mounds had been con- structed by many different groups at different times and that the descendants of these groups were the aboriginal peoples of eastern North America who had been encountered by Europeans beginning in the 16th century.8' By the early 1980s, as the result of increasing knowledge of the history of American archaeology, archaeologists were becoming more aware that archaeological interpretations were deeply influ- enced by ethnic prejudice.82 Nineteenth-century interpretations of archaeological data reflected Eu- ropean and Euro-American ethnocentrism and the belief that these people had in their own racial su- periority. The assumption that indigenous peoples were primitive and unchanging had encouraged serious misreadings of the archaeological record. Cultural change generally had been attributed to migration or diffusion rather than to indigenous de- velopment, and evidence of change often had been totally ignored. Slightly later in the 1980s, feminists began to ex- amine gender biases, both in the practice of archaeol- ogy and in the interpretation of archaeological data. These two issues were connected, since the small number of women who in the past had managed to become archaeologists and the subordinate roles their male colleagues had tried to assign them en- sured that female viewpoints were rarely considered. In the 1980s, androcentric views of the past were critically examined, including the shortcomings of the "man the hunter" version of hominid evolution. It became obvious as a result of these critiques that the history of humanity had been viewed almost ex- clusively from the perspective of the male half of the world's population.83 Last of all, class biases began to be exposed. Espe- cially in historical archaeology, the main emphasis long had been directed toward studying the mate- rial culture of elites and interpretations were char- acterized by projecting modern power relations and social values into the past in a way that made these relations appear natural and unproblematical rather than as the results of specific historical circum- stances. Archaeologists began to pay special atten- tion to evidence relating to the daily lives of peas- ants, slaves, and industrial workers, on the grounds that these are the groups least well represented in written records and hence the ones to whose under- standing archaeologists potentially can contribute the most.84 While some archaeologists grumble about fanati- cism and protest that radical ideas are becoming too influential, most accept the essential validity of these criticisms and many hope that greater aware- ness of these problems will help the interpretation of archaeological evidence to become more rounded and objective. At the same time, however, revealing subjectivity and bias in archaeological interpretation also has encouraged the revival of extreme versions of epistemological idealism. As we have already doc- umented, many archaeologists once again accept the proposition that belief determines action and ex- plains human behavior. Many have also been influ- lo R.

This has as its central tenet that there is no way to ascertain how anyone else perceives or feels about anything. Every decoding of a message is an- other encoding, largely determined by the presup- positions, experiences, and associations that each person brings to the message. This view is repre- sented as empowering the individual by making each human being's understanding unique. The individ- ual is further thought to be empowered when rel- ativism as well as subjectivism is taken into account. Relativism maintains that there are no objective stan- dards by which any person's or group's beliefs may be judged or compared with any other's.85 Ironically, archaeologists who espouse idealism and the notion that the world can be whatever an individual imagines must now deal with a reality in which the resources available for archaeological re- search are becoming increasingly limited as public sources of research funding are curtailed. Like many idealists in other fields, they deal with this problem, not by addressing the political and economic sources of their difficulties, but by denying the significance of material constraints and stressing the power of ideas. One must inquire if this response is a func- tional one or is like the proverbial ostrich with its head buried in the sand. Inferring the Symbolic These developments have led many archaeologists to acknowledge the first part of Childe's argument: that the world people adapt to is not the real world but the world as they imagine it to be. In order to understand why people behaved as they did, ar- chaeologists must ascertain what they believed. It therefore follows that the past must be understood culturally before it can be studied socially or eco- logically. It is argued, for example, that animal bones in middens cannot automatically be used to infer prehistoric diet and subsistence patterns. Some of the animals whose bones are present may have been killed for their hides or feathers alone, while taboos may have required the bones of other animals that were eaten to be disposed of in ways that leave no trace in the archaeological record.86 Even a care- fully butchered carcass may have been an offering that was not consumed by humans. This position marks a return to the viewpoint of Collingwood. Materialists can counter with Childe's second proposition: that, while people may indeed adapt to the environment as they perceive it to be rather than as it is, the perceived and the real environ- ments must be reasonably congruent if society is to survive. Richard Gould has argued that archaeolo- gists should explain what they can ecologically and interpret only residuals symbolically. Thus prefer- ences for different types of chert should be studied initially in terms of their relative utility for making specific types of tools. Only if the preferred type turns out to perform less well or to be much harder to work than other equally available varieties should symbolic explanations be considered.87 This propo- sal, which privileges a behavioral approach, does not take into account that all relations are symbol- ically mediated. Archaeologists come closer to re- ality when they maintain that there is no way to dis- tinguish the ecological and the symbolic in the archaeological record, even though it is often possible to demonstrate that some forms of behav- ior that are recorded archaeologically were ecolog- ically or economically rational. The obvious answer lies in archaeologists doing what they can to infer both the behavioral patterns and the belief systems of the past, so that the two may be compared with each other. Both processual and culture-historical archaeologists have had con- siderable success in inferring technological processes and trading patterns from archaeological data. The strictly limited number of workable solutions to any technological problem and the utility of trace- element analysis for determining the source loca- tions of various kinds of stone, pottery clay, and metal ores permit these processes to be inferred with a high degree of accuracy. On the other hand, vari- ations in the detailed religious beliefs that might have been associated with metallurgy or flint- knapping are so great that the archaeologist has no 85 On postmodernism: J.E Lyotard, The Postmodern Con- dition (Manchester 1984); M.A. Rose, The Post-Modern and the Post-Industrial (Cambridge 1991).

TRIGGER [AJA 102 hope of inferring the specific content of these be- liefs from artifacts alone.88 Similarly, processual archaeology has made con- siderable progress in discovering cross-cultural cor- relations between material culture and behavior in living societies that permit general hunting strat- egies, social hierarchies, and lineage structures to be inferred from archaeological remains.89 Once again, however, the archaeologist cannot emulate the social anthropologist in ascertaining the specific beliefs associated with such behavior. Yet the situation is not hopeless with respect to cognitive phenomena. While ecological determinists often assume that middle-range theory applies only to the more practical aspects of human behavior, similar beliefs recur in historically unrelated situ- ations. The idea of the king as a stranger, or as be- ing in some other way of a different nature from his subjects, has been identified in many cultures around the world that lack any obvious historical connections."9 My comparative study of seven early civilizations, now in progress, has revealed that in each of these societies the cosmos was believed to function as a series of energy flows by means of which supernatural forces sustained the natural world, while human beings in turn sustained the gods by means of offerings that were channeled into the supernatural sphere, with the upper classes acting as the principal intermediaries. These surprising reg- ularities in terms of the general structure of religious beliefs can be interpreted as a projection into the cosmic realm of the tributary relations that bound commoners and rulers together in each of these societies.91 The constraints shaping these particular beliefs were not calculations of efficiency or security, such as deciding which animal species were the most energy-efficient to hunt. Instead they were the prod- ucts of cross-culturally similar reflections on crucial aspects of the social order. If such concepts prove to be universal in all historically documented early civilizations, they will provide useful hypotheses that can be tested archaeologically by looking for archae- ological evidence of the sort of ritual behavior asso- ciated with such beliefs in those early civilizations for which textual evidence is not available. By con- trast, ethnographic and historical evidence demon- strates that it is sheer nonsense to interpret all fe- male figurines as representing mother goddesses.92 Yet, at best, even valid generalizations can suggest only general patterns of belief, not their specific con- tent. For knowing the latter, a single Egyptian or Mesopotamian religious text counts far more than any cross-cultural generalization or any amount of nontextual archaeological evidence. Hodder has proposed that a contextual approach can be used to distinguish between beliefs and prac- tices in the archaeological record. This approach involves playing off the information provided by one aspect of the archaeological record against that pro- vided by other aspects for the same culture or com- munity.93 For example, in modern Saudi Arabia kings and commoners are buried in the same fash- ion, as an expression of Islamic belief in the equal- ity of all Moslems before God and of the Wahabi emphasis on the community of believers.94 Future archaeologists might conclude from a study of Saudi burials that they were dealing with an egalitarian society. Yet an investigation of Saudi settlement pat- terns would reveal quite the opposite, making it clear that Wahabi burial practices were a reflection of ideology rather than of social reality. Even so, with- out written texts or oral traditions, it would be im- possible for archaeologists to infer the specific con- tent of such beliefs. I reluctantly conclude that specific beliefs cannot be inferred from material culture alone. To infer the meaning of symbols, it is necessary to have ver- bal information in the form of written records or oral traditions either from the same culture or from cultures that are historically related to the one be- ing studied.95 Insofar as texts normally are under- stood to be recordings of the spoken word, nothing could be less appropriate than the ubiquitous post- 88 V.G.

That is why historical archaeology is proving so useful for studying relations between beliefs and material culture.97 Unfortunately, processual ar- chaeology's hostility toward the investigation of the culturally specific, as opposed to what is cross- culturally recurrent, has left this a very undeveloped, and until recently an almost abandoned, field. Archaeologists have long assumed that, where there is significant continuity in the archaeological record, it is possible to project historically docu- mented uses or meanings of material culture back into progressively earlier time periods. This is often called the direct historical approach.98 It was casti- gated by Binford, along with all other analogical efforts to attribute behavioral or symbolic meaning to archaeological data, on the grounds that it merely suggested hypotheses rather than demonstrated re- lations.99 In many well-documented cases, however, the concept of continuity appears to be sound. His- torical evidence from ancient Egypt reveals that a specific set of religious beliefs was expressed using the same general iconographic system for over 3,000 years, before both gave way to Christianity in the fourth century A.D.100 Similar examples of continu- ities can be found in Christian Europe, China, In- dia, Islamic countries, and other parts of the world. On the other hand, there are contrary examples of continuity in symbols being accompanied by ra- dical transformations in their meaning, while con- cepts that endure for long periods may, for various political and social reasons, express themselves icon- ographically in different ways at different times.101 It has also been demonstrated that the intensity with which particular beliefs manifest themselves in ma- terial culture can vary considerably from one period to another; hence continuity in beliefs is not nec- essarily matched by continuity in their expression in the archaeological record.102 Clearly much re- mains to be learned about relations between beliefs and their symbolic expression before the direct his- torical approach can be used with confidence to in- fer the meanings that practices had in prehistoric times. Skeptics maintain that, in the absence of accom- panying textual information, the direct historical approach does not allow beliefs to be inferred very far into the past. Yet, in northeastern North Amer- ica, marine shells, native copper, and rock crystals, as well as objects made from these materials, were buried with the dead beginning in the Archaic period, some 6,000 years ago. George Hamell has demonstrated from historical and ethnographic evi- dence that in historical times these substances, which were thought to come from the underworld and were associated with the primal life forces of that region, were believed to confer beneficial powers on both the living and the dead. It therefore seems likely that analogous, though not necessarily identical, beliefs were held in this part of the world as early as the Archaic period.103 Similarly, a growing corpus of comparative ethno- graphic studies suggests that many aspects of ab- original American religions are derived from a set of shamanistic beliefs that may have been brought 96 Hodder (supra n. 28) 126-28; I.

While the direct historical approach may not prove useful for inferring the precise meanings of Upper Palaeolithic cave art in Europe, it does ap- pear to be capable of shedding light on beliefs over much longer periods than most archaeologists have believed. To be really useful, however, as much energy needs to be expended on developing this cul- turally specific approach as processual archaeolo- gists have devoted to elaborating Binford's middle- range theory. That requires establishing a better understanding of the nature of cultural transmission to complement the adaptationist concerns of pro- cessual archaeology. It also requires ascertaining what kinds of archaeological evidence may serve as useful indicators of cognitive and behavioral continuity. On the other hand, the direct historical approach does not work well, even in the short term, in the absence of both associated textual or verbal evidence and significant cultural continuity. I am not certain what arguments could be used to justify Nanno Marinatos's use of textually attested Late Bronze Age Egyptian and Middle Eastern religious beliefs and practices as analogues for inferring those of Minoan Crete. Despite evidence of vigorous trade and cul- tural exchanges linking these three cultures, there do not appear to be enough contextual similarities among their religious practices and iconography to justify this operation. Moreover, the belief systems and cultural practices of Egypt and the Middle East, which are documented both textually and icono- graphically, appear to be very different from one another. Finally, there is no reason to believe that, even if Minoans were intimately familiar with the religious beliefs of their trading partners (which is by no means certain), they would have been signifi- cantly influenced by them. The historical reasons that Marinatos gives for not wanting to project well- attested later Greek beliefs back into the apparently ethnically distinct Minoan culture seem methodo- logically sound. Yet the fact that some sites display, in her words, "remarkable cult continuity" suggests that in this case the direct historical approach might be stronger if applied temporally within Crete itself, rather than by trying to link Crete with neighboring cultures as she proposes.'15 Over the past 15 years, archaeologists appear to have moved beyond the stage where they treat culture, or the ideas that facilitate human under- standing, as something that is ecologically deter- mined and epiphenomenal in nature. An approach that is simply ecological or behaviorist cannot ac- count for the totality either of human activities or of the archaeological record. That realization does not, however, justify going to the opposite extreme and adopting a purely idealist approach, which would constitute an equally limiting form of cultural determinism. Human beings simultaneously inhabit a concep- tual environment that exists in their minds and a social and natural environment that exists indepen- dently of their wills. A challenge that is faced by archaeologists, other social scientists, and philoso- phers is to define more precisely the relations be- tween this inner and outer environment. That is, as I see it, primarily an ontological question that can be answered only on the basis of more detailed evidence. If archaeologists were limited to studying only behavior, as processual archaeologists seem originally to have believed was the case, archaeol- ogy would be unsuited to participate in this project. On the other hand, if archaeologists can forge the tools to study ideas and behavior independently of one another, they will be equipped to participate in the study of this key issue. The Dangers of Extreme Relativism At the same time that postmodern encourage- ment of an interest in subjective phenomena has been a source of significant theoretical and method- ological progress in archaeology, an exaggerated em- phasis on subjectivism and relativism has been call- ing the mission, and perhaps the very reasons for the existence, of archaeology and other social science disciplines into question. While even most positi- vist archaeologists are prepared to admit that the social environment in which they live influences the questions they ask, they believe that by employing proper scientific methods it is possible to distinguish true propositions from false ones.1'06 All relativists are agreed, however, that not only the questions ar- 104 P.T.

This is so to the extent that all humans are predisposed to accept what they think is likely to be true on the basis of minimal supporting evidence, but demand next to impossible levels of proof for propositions that they judge to be extremely distasteful or unreasonable. Contrary to positivist assertions, there is no wholly objective measure of truth. Even positivists accept a general law if it is not contradicted in any, or in the case of statistical generalizations in numerous, observed instances. Yet, in terms of the formal pos- itivist definition of laws as generalizations based on observations, all relevant cases, past, present, and future, would have to be observed before a propo- sition would qualify as a fully confirmed universal generalization. In the real world this is never possible and proof always involves some element of faith.'07 Yet there are two kinds of relativists. In archaeol- ogy, strong relativists, such as Christopher Tilley, Michael Shanks, and Peter Ucko, have maintained (although not always consistently) that there is no empirical basis on which archaeologists can dem- onstrate that one interpretation is right and another wrong. This principle holds, they assert, not only with interpretations that address different issues and hence might be synthesized into a larger whole, but also with interpretations that are mutually exclusive. It is argued that scholars are so blinded by their eth- nic, gender, and class prejudices, and by their cul- tures, that archaeological findings exert little, if any, influence over what they believe. The only way in which an archaeological theory or interpretation can be refuted is to demonstrate that it is illogical.'10 In other words, they accept the validity of coherence truth, that arguments must make sense logically, but deny, or minimize, the efficacy of correspondence truth, the requirement that claims must accord with available evidence.'09 Rarely if ever, to my knowl- edge, have archaeologists claimed that logic itself is culturally relative and hence that what is illogical in one culture might be logical in another."10 I am surprised that some of the more extreme archaeo- logical relativists have not taken this final exhilar- ating step. Even without it, the effect of strong rel- ativism is to turn all archaeological interpretation, or at least that which is logically coherent, into a form of mythmaking. It is further argued by strong relativists that it can- not be maintained that one person's or group's inter- pretation of archaeological evidence is better than another's. Professional archaeologists' claims to have special qualifications are grandiloquently branded as forms of elitist pretension and hegemonic obfus- cation and as attempts to control the past in the in- terest of dominant groups. It is asserted that any individual or group has the right to use archaeolog- ical data to create the past that they want and that there is no valid basis for challenging the validity of such interpretations. Such a position is hailed by its proponents as democratizing archaeology and purging it of its elitist pretensions."' The claims of responsible professional archaeologists, quacks, and xenophobic propagandists are thus placed on a level playing field. Critics object that this leaves no way to distinguish on scientific grounds between Erich von Daniken's constructions of prehistory and those made in good faith by trained archaeologists."2 Shanks and Tilley have further argued that the principal role of archaeologists should be to chal- lenge conventional beliefs and undermine myths that support the existing social order."3 In other words, because archaeology can never be objective, it ought not aspire to be other than a form of coun- terpropaganda. Yet how, we may fairly ask, can ar- chaeology hope to undermine the present social or- der were it to be clear to all concerned that it is 107 B.

Who is going to support archaeol- ogy, financially or academically, if, by its practition- ers' own vociferous proclamations, its findings are no different from historical fiction and if archae- ologists cannotjustifiably claim to be different from novelists or political activists? Moderate relativists stress problems of objectivity and admit that no one can be certain that interpre- tations are free from bias. Yet, like the philosopher Alison Wylie, they maintain that archaeological finds were created independently of archaeologists and therefore offer resistance to the totally free exercise of their imagination and to erroneous interpreta- tions. Archaeologists' beliefs and biases influence which sites are recognized and selected for excava- tion, which artifacts are noted and how they are ana- lyzed, and how data are interpreted. Nevertheless, in the long run, erroneous interpretations are coun- tered and eventually falsified by contrary new data.1"" Many of the more extreme, and frequently cited, misinterpretations of archaeological data, such as the Mound Builder myth in America and the idea of the non-African origin of Great Zimbabwe, were perpetrated at a time when the archaeological record was far less well understood than it is at present. It could be argued that these errors and the colonial mentality that produced them are so obvious only because they are temporally and socially far removed from us, and that equally biased interpretations of the archaeological record still are being produced. There is obviously no way to prove that this is not the case. Yet it is clear that both these interpreta- tions were rejected, not as a result of arguments that were advanced by propagandists who were strongly opposed to the racist and colonial mentalities that had encouraged them, but because of archaeolog- ical discoveries that were incompatible with them. In the case of Great Zimbabwe, the turning point consisted of Gertrude Caton Thompson's discovery that Bantu pottery, which could be dated to the 10th to 13th centuries A.D. on the basis of its asso- ciation with Chinese porcelain of the Song Dynasty, underlay, as well as was found associated with, the stone constructions at Great Zimbabwe and similar sites."6 Both Caton Thompson and Cyrus Thomas, who demonstrated that the Mound Builders were not a separate race from the North American In- dians, tried to make their finds more acceptable to the racists of their time by arguing that the cultures they had shown to be of indigenous origin were not as evolved as previous researchers had claimed."' While the archaeological record undoubtedly still is being interpreted in ways that are biased and erroneous, it appears that as it becomes better known, as a result of the collection of more data and the development of better techniques for inter- preting these data, it is more able to constrain the imagination of archaeologists. Hence today's errone- ous interpretations tend not to be so long-lived, and are more contested and less socially persuasive than they were in the past. I would also suggest that, while an unbiased interpretation of archaeological data may never be possible, nor may archaeologists be able to establish the objectivity or truth of any specific interpretation, it has proved possible over the years to construct a more comprehensive and accurate picture of what happened in the past and to gain a better understanding of how and why change has occurred. There is also historical evidence that in terms of generalizing about human behavior, no less than understanding the history of specific cultures, inter- pretation can be constrained by archaeological data rather than simply imposed on such data, as the strong idealists would have it. Because most North American archaeologists in the 19th century believed that Indians were primitive and incapable of learn- ing to do things differently, they did not expect to find evidence of change in the archaeological record and did not bother to look for it. When such evi- dence was found, most of them still maintained that aboriginal cultures were static and tried to explain cultural change in specific regions in terms of un- changing cultures shifting about and replacing each other in specific locales. By the early 20th century, it was clear that changes had occurred within cul- tures that could not be explained in this fashion. These changes were attributed to a form of cultural diffusion that involved most of the important new ideas coming from Mexico and Siberia. The im- plication was that North American Indians were in- 114 Hodder (supra n. 28) 178-80. 115 M.A. Wylie, "Epistemological Issues Raised by a Structuralist Archaeology," in Hodder (supra n. 75) 39-46.

A still more detailed understanding of the archae- ological record slowly revealed that postulating the exogenous origin of new ideas still failed to explain the whole of it. As a result of such obser- vations, archaeologists finally had to admit that ab- original Americans were as innovative as any other peoples."8 There is a temptation to read this history of North American archaeology as an indication of the extent to which all archaeological interpretations are influ- enced by the prejudices that archaeologists bring to their work. In this case, however, there is strong evidence that more favorable interpretations of ab- original behavior did not result as much from ar- chaeologists being influenced by improving social attitudes toward aboriginal people as from their re- alizing the incompatibility between existing archae- ological interpretations and their underlying as- sumptions about Indians, on the one hand, and the evidence that they were collecting, on the other. Such histories, like the demise of the Rider Haggard-style vision of Great Zimbabwe, bear witness to the er- roneousness of a strong relativist position and to the capacity of evidence to alter even deeply en- trenched understandings. Strong relativism and its associated idealist ontol- ogy emerge as philosophies of despair and, like most such philosophies, turn out to be unduly pessimis- tic. Archaeological interpretation is not merely, as extreme relativists would persuade us, a matter of politics and propaganda, or, as Glyn Daniel and Stuart Piggott more politely suggested, of personal opinion. This is so, at least in large part, because real life is not whatever we want it to be. Humans almost certainly, as Childe realized long ago, adapt to the world not as it is but as they imagine it to be. Yet, if the world as groups collectively imagine it is not fairly congruent with the world as it really is, such groups may starve to death and have no ideas at all. By acknowledging physical constraints and trying to understand how human beings conceptu- alized the world, archaeologists can provide useful insights into the forces that have shaped human his- tory and will continue to do so. Realism as a Framing Epistemology Archaeologists can never be sure that a particu- lar interpretation is correct, still less that it can never be improved. Yet today they are asking more ques- tions than ever before, have more techniques to ana- lyze data than ever before, and are increasingly aware of their biases and try to compensate for them. A growing awareness of the role that such biases play in the interpretation of archaeological data, and in the practice of archaeology, is a development that all archaeologists should welcome. But multiple standpoints do not simply create multiple, incom- patible archaeologies. They challenge all archaeol- ogists, wherever possible, to use this multiplicity to create more holistic and objective syntheses. Their goal should be an archaeology that is more complete and less biased because it is informed by an ever- increasing number of viewpoints and constrained by more data. The only way to achieve this goal that is compat- ible with a biological evolutionary view of human origins is to adopt a materialist ontology and a re- alist epistemology. Human beings exist by drawing energy from the physical world, and the mind, as a property of the brain, is as material as anything else. Archaeologists must study the human mind in terms of both the innate cognitive properties of the brain and the acquired knowledge that allow that organ to interpret sensory observations. The result- ing understanding constitutes the conceptualized world to which human beings adapt. Culture in turn must be viewed as a highly flexible mechanism that serves to adapt human beings to the external envi- ronment and has enabled them to transform that environment to an ever greater extent. Archaeol- ogists finally must acknowledge the role that the senses play as mediators between the external real world and the inner world of the mind and the abil- ity of sensory observations to alter conceptions re- lating to the real world. Because the conceptualized world is linked to the real world through our senses, all humans (including extreme idealists - both epis- temological and ontological) must pragmatically ac- knowledge that they do not exist independently of external constraints. Without the ability to respond to sensory stimuli, the mind would be unable to play an adaptive role. Realism is a messy and eclectic epistemology, em- bracing the study of processes and emergent prop- erties as well as of what can be observed directly; interested in causality as well as correlation; and try- ing to incorporate mind into a system of knowing that also involves sensory experience and entities that are external to the observer. Its principal and overwhelmingly important virtue is that it treats mind, senses, and external reality in an interrelated fashion. This view corresponds more closely with 118 Trigger (supra n. 82).</page><page sequence="24">24 BRUCE G. TRIGGER [AJA 102 reality as archaeologists experience it in their daily lives than does positivism's efforts to privilege sen- sory experience or idealism's efforts to privilege the mind as an exclusive means of knowing. The questions that archaeologists must address in order to understand the past bear a close resem- blance to those that all humans must confront in their personal and professional lives. This correspon- dence is no accident. The processes that shaped life in the past must resemble, at least in a general fash- ion, those that shape it today. Unfortunately, this observation does not take us very far in actually understanding the past since, ironically, one of the most striking uniformities in human behavior is humanity's biologically conditioned capacity for cul- tural diversity. In the final part of this article, I con- sider some of the conceptual problems that are in- volved in trying to understand this diversity. IMAGINATION AND SCIENTIFIC CURIOSITY In popular belief and the mythology concerning science, science and imagination have nothing in common. Science is assumed to employ the most rig- orous criteria of logic to draw conclusions from ob- servations made under stringent and ideally repli- cable conditions. Imagination, by contrast, appears to belong to the realm of art and creative literature. Yet even brief reflection indicates that this dichotomy is untenable. Imagination is essential if scientific pro- gress is to be made. Imagining the Unimagined Richard Bradley has reminded us that, without creativity, archaeologists would be left without any- thing new to say. He stresses the value of imagina- tion as a source of ideas that will promote the growth of archaeology and maintains that, unless archaeol- ogy nurtures the creative imagination, it will cease to flourish as a scientific pursuit."9 More specifi- cally, progress in archaeology depends on the ar- chaeologist's ability to imagine pasts that are radically different from the present and from the ways that the past is currently imagined. Very little attention has been paid, however, to the role of imagination in archaeology or any other social science. The development of science largely consists of the once unthought of becoming commonplace. In clas- sical times, among astronomers and geographers, the flat earth of common sense gave way to a spher- ical planet as efforts were made to explain numer- ous observations, both terrestrial and celestial, for which a flat earth could not account. In a similar manner, an earth-centered universe yielded to a heliocentric one, that more recently has been ex- panded by the vision of a cosmos composed of a vast number of galaxies. These successive views were not products of simple induction, but resulted from in- dividuals being able to conceptualize radical alter- natives to received opinions and eventually to per- suade others that their views accounted for reality better than did previous concepts. A spectacular example of such a transformation in recent times is provided by the phenomenon of continental drift. In the 19th century, uniformitar- ian geologists assumed that continents did not move. This assumption, however, created problems for biol- ogists and palaeontologists who were trying to ac- count for distributions of plants and animals. Some postulated the appearances and disappearances of land bridges, which Darwin protested were invoked so often and erratically that they violated the prin- ciples of uniformitarian geology. Others, including Darwin, tried to account for distributions of plants and animals by assuming forms of marine and aer- ial transport that even their proponents found unconvincing. In 1915, the German meteorologist Alfred We- gener, drawing on earlier observations, proposed that a single great land mass, Pangaea, had begun to sep- arate into the present continents in the Mesozoic era. Although much of his theory was based on the apparent fit of the bulge of eastern South America and the west coast of Africa, subsequent research- ers, especially those working in the southern hemi- sphere, noted numerous geological and palaeonto- logical resemblances that suggested that currently separated landmasses had once beenjoined together. Yet, even when I took an undergraduate geology course at the University of Toronto in the late 1950s, continental drift was dismissed as improbable spec- ulation. The idea was not considered seriously until the 1960s, when evidence of seafloor spreading from oceanic ridges proved that ocean basins were not permanent global features. Today continental drift is being measured on a short-term basis and mech- anisms have been proposed that explain both it and many other geological features in uniformitarian terms. The challenge in this case was to imagine a process that was too slow to be apparent to human observers. 120 119 R.

In the 18th century, Enlightenment philosophers had believed that, by arranging cultures existing in the modern world from simplest to most complex, they could replicate the various stages through which European civilization had evolved. Once it became apparent, however, that human beings had not been created in essentially their mod- ern form only a few thousand years ago but had evolved over a much longer period from some ape- like ancestor, the problems posed by the origins of culture became more complex and ethnographic evi- dence insufficient to answer them. In 1872 Charles Lyell had argued that early humans had lived by gath- ering vegetable food in a tropical environment and had only begun to hunt after they had expanded into the temperate zone.121 In 1913, the British physician Harry Campbell suggested that, while the ancestors of the human species had abandoned the trees in search of meat, they were at first limited to eating "vermin,' and only later became able to hunt larger game.122 These proposals were formulated long before any archaeological evidence was available to test them. Donald Grayson has demonstrated that middle- range research, and in particular research directed toward the extraction of evidence that is diagnostic of formation processes, is not a new phenomenon but has been "routinely spawned by situations in which archaeologists recognize perplexing ambigu- ity in the patterning presented to them by archae- ological data."'2 Nowhere is such ambiguity more omnipresent than in the archaeology of the Lower Palaeolithic era. By the 1860s, European evolution- ists expected that Late Tertiary artifacts might be found but they would be so crude that they could be distinguished only with difficulty from naturally broken rocks. In 1867 the Abbe Louis Bourgeois claimed to have found such crude artifacts in The- nay, east of Tours. The leading French Palaeolithic archaeologist, Gabriel de Mortillet, accepted these and other Late Tertiary finds as artifacts, which he called eoliths, or dawn stones, and introduced into the earliest stages of his classification of European prehistory. Some other archaeologists, however, failed to see traces of human workmanship in such speci- mens and Adrien Arcelin demonstrated that similar material occurred in lower Eocene deposits and hence could not have been produced by early hu- mans. Supporters of eoliths tried to establish diag- nostic signatures of a human role in their produc- tion, while opponents sought to prove that they could have been produced by natural forces. The issue was finally resolved in the late 1930s when the British archaeologist A.S. Barnes found that 75% of the nu- merous stone flake tools he measured had "angle platform-scars" of less than 900, while this angle ex- ceeded 900 in 75% of the naturally broken speci- mens he studied. These edge angles were formed by the intersection of the surface on which pressure had been applied and of the scar left by the flake removed. Barnes argued that acute angles were nec- essary for effective flake removal and tool use. Col- lections of eoliths from different sites clearly fell into the natural category.'24 European eoliths ceased to be regarded as artifacts and, given the absence of other conclusive evidence, it was generally accepted that hominids had not lived in Europe prior to the Acheulean epoch. Claims of early Palaeolithic discoveries in the United States were countered even more quickly. In 1860 an amateur archaeologist, Charles Abbott, be- came convinced that crude artifacts being turned up on his ancestral farm near Trenton, New Jersey, had been produced by the precursors of modern Na- tive American groups. In 1876 he attributed them to a different, probably Palaeolithic, race and two years later proclaimed that these finds dated from the glacial period. Abbott's claims were supported by Frederick Putnam, the curator of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, and by various geologists. The Smithson- ian Institution countered by sending William H. Holmes to investigate an Indian lithic quarry site. Holmes's work indicated that the so-called turtle- backs, which were hallmarks of Abbott's Palaeolithic age, were in reality rejects marking a stage in the manufacturing of stone tools rather than finished implements. The relative crudeness of an implement could not be interpreted as evidence of its antiquity. Holmes continued after 1890 to examine all known quarry and alleged Palaeolithic sites in eastern North 121 C. Lyell, Principles of Geology" 2 (London 1872) 470- 71. 122 H.

While his findings did not completely silence the proponents of an early hominid presence, his work introduced a strong element of caution into their previously unrestrained speculations. It was left to Ale' Hrdlitka's refutation of supposedly early hu- man skeletal finds and the failure of later archae- ologists to discover archaeological remains in North America dating from Lower Palaeolithic times to re- fute Abbott's claims.'25 As earlier forms of hominids were discovered in southern and eastern Africa during the 20th century, new interpretive problems arose. The evidence that the earliest hominids had brains that were little big- ger than those of modern great apes suggested that a human hunter-gatherer model might not by itself provide appropriate analogues for interpreting the behavior of these creatures. Apes lack the symbolic and linguistic skills that are shared by all human groups and their sexual physiology is quite different from that of humans. By the 1950s, it had been con- cluded that the behavior of nonhuman primates as well as that of modern hunter-gatherers would have to be taken into account in inferring the behavior of early hominids. But which nonhuman primates? Some looked to chimpanzees and gorillas, who were the surviving species most closely related to humans. Others drew analogies with baboons, who were less closely related to humans but lived on the savannas, as the early hominids who had evolved into humans appear to have done. Still others sought to utilize a combina- tion of features from both groups. These analogies drew upon the more social primates, while gener- ally ignoring the solitary or pair-bonding orangutans and gibbons. Males, who are physically larger than females, were seen as playing a major role in defend- ing females, and hence the reproductive capacity of the group, and their hierarchical male bonding was interpreted as a central feature of early hominid so- cial organization. Comparisons of such behavior with that believed to be common to all modern hunter-gatherer soci- eties suggested that the main changes that had taken place in social organization in the course of hom- inid evolution had been the development of male- female pair bonding and the emergence of the nu- clear family within the context of small societies that continued to be dominated by rivalrous and hier- archically organized males. It was argued that greater dependence on meat-eating favored greater intelli- gence, slower maturation, and a sexual division of labor in which males risked their lives hunting for game while females cared for children and collected vegetable food and small game near base camps.126 The main conclusion of this research was that early hominids had soon come to behave much like mod- ern hunter-gatherers. More recently feminist critiques have called tra- ditional interpretations of hunter-gatherer societies into question and studies of bonobos, or pygmy chimpanzees, have provided examples of highly so- cial great apes whose females play an active role in selecting mates and maintaining social cohesion. Among bonobos cooperation is more important and competition less so than among other chimpan- zees and gorillas."27 This research provides a wider range of options for modeling early hominid social behavior. Hypotheses about early hominid social behavior proved very difficult to confirm or refute using archaeological data. Many disputes remain unre- solved. Did crude stone tools, such as those associ- ated with the Early Oldowan industry, which changed slowly if at all over long periods, indicate a lack of cognitive ability, the absence of challenge to perform better, or a dearth of cultural capital on which sig- nificant innovations could be based? Opinions still differ widely, with some archaeologists treating sym- bolic and linguistic ability as developing very early in hominid history and making pre-Homo erectus forms only quantitatively different from ourselves. Others, noting the lack of symbolic representations or other evidence of symbolic behavior in Lower or even Middle Palaeolithic times, have concluded that modern forms of linguistic and symbolic behavior do not antedate modern forms of Homo sapiens.'28 Once again, however, the development of middle- range theory has allowed significant progress to be made. The first major debate concerned the status 125 D.J. Meltzer, "The Antiquity of Man and the Devel- opment of American Archaeology," in M.B.

Raymond Dart interpreted the Australopithecine bones as those of hominids who had killed and eaten many other species of animals and used their teeth and bones as tools and weapons.' 29 Dart's dramatic view of human beings being descended from "killer apes" was popularized by Robert Ardrey in his book African Genesis.'13 Others, however, believed that all these bones, including those of the Australopithe- cines, represented the meals of hyenas and other scav- engers. Taphonomic studies suggested that at least some of the Australopithecines had been killed by large carnivores and that their bones, like those of the other animals, had been washed into the caves. 131 Mary and Lewis Leakey interpreted their early hominid sites in East Africa as the remains of en- campments of big-game hunters.'32 The evidence that Jane Goodall had collected of the important role played by small-game hunting among male chim- panzees suggested that early hominids might have confronted and killed the larger animals whose bones were found in these sites. While this model received considerable support,'" Binford, who had long ex- pressed considerable doubts about early hominid cognitive abilities, remained skeptical. He proposed that early hominids might not have been big-game hunters, but scavengers along the lines of hyenas and jackals.134 Binford's proposal stimulated important taphonomic research. He argued that, before ani- mal bones found in Lower Palaeolithic sites are inter- preted as having been brought there by early hom- inid hunters, it is necessary to determine what types and numbers of bones would have occurred in par- ticular sorts of terrain in the absence of any hom- inids. Binford in this way called into question the interpretation of various Lower Palaeolithic finds as kill sites or hunting camps.'35 Subsequent study of bone remains has revealed breakage patterns that strongly support scavenging rather than big-game hunting. During the Oldowan period, hominids may have hunted small game as chimpanzees do, but most of the meat they consumed was obtained from carcasses already much picked over by feline predators or other scavengers. Evidence of big-game hunting does not appear until later Lower Palaeolithic times.136 By questioning received opinions, Binford and earlier researchers stimulated research that has altered our understanding of early hominid behavior in significant ways. Some of the ideas we have been considering re- lating to life in Palaeolithic times were confirmed by subsequent research and others were refuted. What is important in each case is that, by contra- dicting accepted interpretations of the past, these ideas stimulated research that tested both old and new ideas. The result in each case was to advance archaeology both methodologically and in terms of its understanding of the past. The greatest obstacle to making progress in archaeology is complacency. Without the ability to imagine alternative explana- tions, archaeology languishes. On the other hand, without the opportunity and determination to test ideas, imagination is of little value. Controlling Imagination Bradley sees talent and imagination in archaeol- ogy today as being curtailed, if not crushed, by moral earnestness and acute critical self-consciousness.'137 What he calls moral earnestness embraces political correctness and a related desire that archaeological findings should support what are deemed to be, and in many instances undeniably are, progressive causes. It is true that archaeologists, like all other social sci- entists, have a moral duty to defend freedom of in- quiry and that they are now, perhaps even more than in the past, being consciously manipulated by po- litical agendas. Yet there is nothing fundamentally new about this sort of behavior; only the issues have changed. One even has some reason to hope that an ever growing database renders the negative im- pacts of political correctness on research progres- sively less virulent.

TRIGGER [AJA 102 couraged by the vogue for idealist epistemology, is an overabundance of imagination without adequate concern for archaeological testing. Hodder's The Do- mestication ofEurope is the most sustained application of a structural approach to archaeological data yet attempted.'38 In it Hodder examines the distribu- tion of iconographic, or what are assumed to be icon- ographic, elements in relation to various examples of houses, tombs, settlements, and landscapes in Europe from Neolithic times into the Iron Age, with evidence from the Middle East being considered as it relates to the beginning of this sequence. On the basis of these examples, Hodder postulates a series of changes in beliefs that took the form of structural adjustments in relations among a set of binary op- positions that include nature and culture, male and female, wild and domestic, field and house (agrios and domus), outer and inner, front and back, light and dark, east and west, life and death. He also makes considerable use of the concept of boundary (foris). As a structuralist, Hodder assumes that human thought is constrained by conceptual dichotomies that can undergo significant permutations in their mutual relations, while the system to which they be- long remains unchanged. He assumes that underly- ing culture is a deep structure, or essence, governed by its own laws, that is hidden from view but ensures regularities in the phenomena that emanate from it. Within this structure, concepts acquire their mean- ing by the position they occupy vis-a-vis other con- cepts. In other words, culture as a whole is assumed to have many of the same properties as language.'39 Hodder then imputes meanings to these patterns and suggests how alterations in their meanings over time relate to social change. It is by no means clear, however, how Hodder has gone about interpreting the patternings he has ob- served in the archaeological record. Sometimes he appears to have assumed universal meanings, a pro- cedure that runs contrary to his insistence on the incomparability of cultures, but which he uses else- where, as, for example, in his argument that trash is used symbolically in many cultures to demarcate boundaries.140 Yet, despite his inclusion of material relating to the Middle East, Hodder also suggests that, from perhaps as long ago as the Upper Palaeolithic period to the present, there has been sufficient con- tinuity in various concepts that are unique to Europe that someone nurtured in modern Europe could, as a result of sharing these ideas, have privileged intuitive insights into the thought patterns of pre- historic times.141 Those insights presumably would not be shared by an archaeologist who was born and grew up in China but had studied European prehis- tory, while analogous ones concerning China would be inaccessible to European archaeologists who were trained as sinologists. Hodder does not specify whether these continu- ities correlate with a biological population, a cul- tural tradition, a language family, or perhaps all three, although his use of Indo-European terms to label some of his oppositions suggests that they might be tied to the Indo-European language family. This aspect of Hodder's analysis represents an extension of the direct historical approach to embrace intui- tive and even mystical notions resembling those once associated with the more chauvinistic interpre- tations of European archaeology. The nature of his proposed continuities is never clearly defined and continuity is assumed rather than demonstrated archaeologically. Many of Hodder's oppositions also appear to be highly ethnocentric and of questionable antiquity. I doubt, for example, that the distinction between nature and culture that is central not only to Hodder's analysis but also to much of Levi-Strauss's, meant anything to Europeans prior to about 500 B.C. His- torical and ethnographic evidence suggests that, prior to that time, Europeans would have concep- tualized what we view as the natural world as being animated by spiritual powers that possessed minds and wills similar to those of humans. This under- standing made no use of the distinctions that Eu- ropeans and others later would draw between nature, society, and the supernatural. It was only after the desacralization of nature that took place in Greece, parts of the Near East, India, and China around the middle of the first millennium B.C. that a distinction between nature and culture probably had meaning anywhere in the world.142 138 Hodder (supra n. 86). 139 For general treatments of structuralism, R.

Instead the wild is viewed as a nurtur- ing sphere controlled by powers on whose friendship and benevolence humans must rely.143 Hodder's de- lineation of patterning in the archaeological record, while far from systematic, offers empirical general- izations that invite study and interpretation. Yet his own interpretations, while often very clever and thought-provoking, are frequently unprovable and in many cases may be highly misleading. Archaeological interpretation along these lines is nevertheless currently very popular. Archaeolo- gists search the archaeological record for pattern- ing that may have symbolic meaning. Distributions of different types of human bones or broken pot- tery are established in relation to different parts of European megalithic tombs. Or the orientations of burials and cult centers are correlated with various astronomical phenomena and with natural features of the landscape. The archaeologist then proceeds to suggest symbolic meanings that these remains might have had in cultures that produced or used them."14 This research often has the merit of draw- ing attention to hitherto unobserved patterning in archaeological data. For example, landscape ar- chaeology systematically is identifying features that can and cannot be observed from other points in various regions. Although religious beliefs and ideas such as geomancy have long been recognized as play- ing a role in shaping the distribution of human struc- tures across the landscape and influencing how the landscape was conceptualized,145 prehistoric archae- ologists had paid little attention to this issue until recently. Processual archaeology encouraged the be- lief that such meanings were imposed in an epiphe- nomenal fashion on a landscape that already had been shaped by material considerations, which im- plied that meanings would be both archaeologically inaccessible and of trivial importance. Yet the prob- lem remains of how the inferences concerning mean- ing that archaeologists have attached to these pat- terns can be tested. When more solid arguments cannot be offered, in the form of universal generalizations or the di- rect historical approach, these archaeologists often will represent their interpretations as suggestions that future research may support or refute. In prin- ciple, this is harmless, but it encourages the accu- mulation of increasing amounts of unverified and often mutually reinforcing speculation, which may be little different from the erudite etymological non- sense that preceded the development of compara- tive philology. Those who are attracted by extreme idealist epistemologies or postmodern sophistry may go further and attempt to justify their inconclusive interpretations as valid end points of archaeologi- cal research. Archaeologists are held invariably to be biased by contemporary beliefs and concerns; hence any interpretation of the past is bound to re- veal more about the prevailing ideology of their own culture than about prehistoric beliefs or actions.146 It has been further argued that material objects as symbols are "irreducibly polysemous,' which means they signify different things to different people and even different things to the same person at different times.147 This not only implies that the symbolic meanings that artifacts might have had in prehistoric cultures are frequently inaccessible, but also denies that there ever was an "original meaning to be tex- tually recreated in an analysis of a set of artifacts''"148 Under these conditions, the only meanings that artifacts can have today are those that archaeolo- 143 N.

TRIGGER [AJA 102 gists and others assign them. Shanks and Tilley have asserted that "there is no way of choosing be- tween alternative pasts except on essentially polit- ical grounds"'49 That conclusion has such nihilistic implications for archaeology that in recent years even its more vocal advocates have begun to distance them- selves from the extreme subjectivism that underlies it.150 The solution is not to curb the archaeological imagination, which as a source of new ideas contri- butes to the health and vigor of the discipline. But, like genetic mutations in living organisms, novel ideas must be subject to some form of rigorous se- lection if they are to contribute to the well-being of a discipline rather than destabilize it. In the sciences, selection takes the form of testing, refutation, and verification. An archaeologist can produce any num- ber of ideas about the past or the nature of cultural change, but unless these ideas can be tested, they will do little to advance archaeology. On the contrary, they will have a negative impact by wasting time and resources and sowing unnecessary confusion. The greatest contribution that processual archaeology has made to the general development of archaeol- ogy is its insistence that interpretations must be sub- jected to explicit forms of verification. The aim of such testing is not simply to refute hypotheses, as Karl Popper advocated,'51 or to establish absolute truth, which is not humanly possible. It is to achieve a deeper and more accurate understanding of the past. I have already argued that all testing does not have to be conducted in terms of universal general- izations, which do not account for culturally specific regularities. 152 A productive discipline of archaeology requires both the flourishing of creative imagination and a determination to subject the products of that imag- ination to rigorous testing. Deprived of either of these ingredients, archaeology will fall short of its creative potential. We must recognize that some ideas cannot be tested, although they may become testable in the future as new data or new analytical proce- dures become available. We must also acknowledge the truth of Bunge's observation that "we shall never attain an exhaustive knowledge of the past or even of the present, because most facts are never recorded [and] some documents are destroyed or lost."'""53 Cultivating Imagination The greater problem for many archaeologists, in- cluding myself, is not that of controlling a hyperac- tive imagination but of not having enough imagi- nation. What recourse is there for the imaginatively challenged? Collingwood, as a classical archaeo- logist, advocated immersing oneself in the non- archaeological data relating directly to the culture being studied-which may amount to a great deal or very little. Provided that the distinctive nature of the textual and oral sources is taken into account, this approach provides insights into the meaning of archaeological data, at the same time that archae- ological finds stimulate a better understanding of the meaning of textual sources and oral traditions. Such a synergistic approach has tended to be the preferred form of interpretation in classical studies, Egyptology, Assyriology, and sinology, and, as a consequence of recent advances in the transla- tion of Mayan texts, it is struggling against proces- sual archaeology to establish itself in Mayan studies.154 Its main limitation is that, while it is very efficient at drawing archaeologists' attention to cul- turally specific meanings, it leaves them unaware of broader, cross-cultural parallels that facilitate valu- able and often quite different insights into the be- havioral significance of archaeological data. This sug- gests the importance of supplementing what is known from textual or ethnographic sources about the cul- ture that is being studied archaeologically with a greater awareness of cross-cultural variation. While such knowledge is often stressed as the prin- cipal strength of an anthropological approach to ar- chaeology, as we have already noted, social anthro- pologists, especially those who espouse unilinear evolution, have been curiously negligent about study- ing cross-cultural variability. By failing to compare societies at similar levels of development in differ- ent regions of the world, and basing their ideas about what such societies are like largely on examples from 149 Shanks and Tilley 1987 (supra n. 96) 195. 150 Shanks and Tilley 1989 (supra n. 96) 4; M.

Archaeological interpretation is a challenging task to which no one ever can bring enough com- parative knowledge. Imagination can also be encouraged by the man- ner in which theories are constructed and tested. Binford's advocacy of a nomological-deductive meth- od, combined with his support for an ecologically determinist approach to explaining human behav- ior, encouraged a premature commitment to a theory that in the long run has turned out not to account for as many aspects of human behavior or of the archaeological record as was anticipated. Support- ers can argue that much has been learned along the way and that archaeology is the better for having adopted this approach. Yet, it equally could be main- tained that archaeology would have progressed further, both in the interpretation of data and in theory building, had it stayed with the method of multiple or alternative working hypotheses that was being advocated by many archaeologists in the 1950s. As expounded by T.C. Chamberlin, this approach proposed that, where a single explanation of data is inconclusive, it is best to formulate a series of al- ternative explanations, each with its own test impli- cations. The discovery of new data may eliminate specific alternatives and permit surviving ones to be elaborated.'56 The advantage of this approach, which has much in common with ideas advocated by Kelley and Hanen,'57 is that it does not commit archaeologists to a particular high-level theory. On the contrary, it encourages the empirical testing of how various such theories accord with specific ex- planations that prove viable in the long run. This approach is especially important given the ambiguous and controversial nature of what passes for high-level theories in the social sciences. They still cover a spectrum that runs from ecological de- terminism at one extreme to cultural determinism at the other. If there is broad agreement that the more plausible explanations of human behavior are to be found somewhere in the middle, there is no consen- sus concerning the precise nature of these expla- nations.15" A second advantage is that the method of multiple working hypotheses encourages social scientists to search for alternative patterning and significance in their data. As a result, imagination is promoted rather than stifled by this approach to formulating and testing explanations of archaeolog- ical data. Science cannot operate without having gen- eral propositions to apply and test, but to try to struc- ture decades of archaeological research exclusively around a single, highly specific, high-level theory at this stage in the development of the social sciences is to waste resources and invite disappointment. Finally, I would suggest that processual archaeol- ogy limited the development of a more profound understanding of human behavior by subscribing to the position that the principal goal of archaeol- ogy, as well as social anthropology, should be to create general laws concerning human behavior and cul- tural change. This idea did not begin with Binford or with processual archaeology. It had been accepted by Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips in Method and Theory in American Archaeology in 1958, and advocated by Walter Taylor in 1948, Clyde Kluckhohn in 1940, and Alfred Kidder still earlier.'59 All of them had argued that science was concerned with generaliza- tion and therefore that the ultimate goal of archaeol- ogy, if it was to become a science, must be to gen- 155 Neoevolutionists, with rare exceptions such as R.

This view overlooked the fact, repeatedly emphasized by Alfred Kroeber, that the physical and biological sciences embrace both generalizing and historical disciplines. Cosmog- ony, historical geology, and palaeontology are all his- torical, and are not, for that reason, regarded as any less scientific than physics, chemistry, astronomy, geol- ogy, botany, and zoology.160 Moreover, while the currently accepted synthetic theory of biological evolution explains in a perfectly satisfactory manner how change occurs, it cannot predict the specific lines that change will follow or what its consequences may be. This is because the factors involved in any specific example of change, such as the particular species that is evolving, the changes that are occurring in the environment, and the specific characteristics of competitors, are ex- tremely complex and frequently vary independently of one another. As a consequence, each instance of biological evolutionary change can be explained in retrospect, but cannot be specified, or predicted, in advance. 161 Because processual archaeologists, as neoevolu- tionists, assumed that human behavior was highly regular, they thought that it would not be difficult to formulate general laws that would explain the most salient aspects of human behavior as well as account for the histories of specific societies. In general, so- ciocultural change appears to display more uniline- arity than does biological evolution. That is because at least in the long term more complex societies are able to dominate, encapsulate, and even absorb smaller societies when the two compete for the same territories and resources. As some societies have grown more complex and expanded the scope of their operations at the expense of neighboring groups, the range of intersocietal variation has de- clined, although at the same time intrasocietal vari- ation has increased as surviving societies have grown larger and more complex. Moreover, because cultural behavior is learned, it is possible for humans to aban- don uncompetitive behavior patterns and lifestyles and emulate those of more successful groups, al- though this process may take a long time and be very difficult if the gap in complexity between two cul- tures is very great. An additional constraint on social variation arises from there being only a limited range of economic, political, and ideological patterns that fit together to form viable systems. To cite an extreme example, it seems certain that no society will ever be found that has both a big-game hunting subsistence base and a divine monarchy. Sociocultural variation may be considerably greater than processual archaeol- ogists once imagined, but the need for functional integration limits what is possible within viable sys- tems. For all these reasons, there tends to be less di- versity among human societies than among repro- ductively isolated biological species that have many ecological niches to which they can adapt and whose existence is terminated primarily as a result of nat- ural selection bringing about the replacement of one species by another. This produces the dendritic pat- tern that has characterized biological evolution.'62 In spite of this, there is much specific variation between one society and another even when they are at the same general stage of development, and still more variation in the processes by which social change comes about.163 It may be, and I believe it is, a valid task to try to identify and understand the general patterns and processes in human history. But understanding the linear patterns that charac- terize sociocultural evolution is different from ac- counting for how specific societies have changed, which is a highly contingent process. The decline of the Roman empire and the collapse of the low- land Classic Maya states may have features in com- mon, but these shared features cannot be understood until the development and decline of both societies have been accounted for in their specific detail. Only in this way is it possible to delineate and try to under- stand the reasons for both the similarities and the differences between the two processes. Imposing gen- eral evolutionary patterns on particular cases is usu- ally done, and even then inadvisedly, only in situ- ations where little is known about what specifically happened. At best it results in nothing new being learned, but more often it produces a pseudo- 160 A.L. Kroeber, The Nature of Culture (Chicago 1952) 66-78. 161 Bunge (supra n. 1) 160-63. 162 B.G.

Unfortunately, the latter was the case with Steward's celebrated "Cultural Causality and Law: A Trial For- mulation of the Development of Early Civiliza- tions"164 and with most of the neoevolutionary schemes of the 1960s. Contrary to much sociocultural evolutionary practice, if the specific cannot be pre- dicted on the basis of a generalized understanding, it is necessary to understand the particular in specific terms before using it as a basis for elaborating and testing any evolutionary or behavioral generaliza- tions. Far from belittling generalization, such a pro- cedure seeks to establish it on a scientifically cred- ible foundation. This perspective justifies adopting a historical ap- proach to understanding cultural change either as an end in itself or as a necessary prelude to attempt- ing to formulate evolutionary generalizations about the processes of sociocultural change and the gen- eral shape of human history. In The Logic of Historical Explanation, Clayton Roberts argues that historical explanations are attempts to use facts to establish why events occurred.165 The goal of historians is thus to establish causes rather than merely correla- tions. Because human beings actively pursue goals, a search for causes is legitimate in terms of a realist, if not a doctrinaire positivist, epistemology. Roberts is particularly concerned with detailing the many different ways in which historians seek to trace and integrate sequences of causation in order to explain specific events. He provides an understanding of the nature of historical explanation that is far removed from the grossly simplistic caricatures that proces- sual archaeologists produced of it in the 1960s.166 Karl Marx never drew a clear distinction between what I am here calling sociocultural evolution and history. On the one hand, he proposed grand schemes of evolution that seem to be materialist counterparts of Hegelian cosmic mysticism. On the other hand, in a work such as "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte," Marx applied his far-reaching under- standing of economic and social behavior to provide a detailed analysis of specific events in which indi- vidual personalities, curious conjunctures, and sheer miscalculations played significant roles.167 His studies of the transition from feudalism to capital- ism in Europe are also deeply grounded in empir- ical data and closely argued. One cannot help think- ing that Marx's macroevolutionary schemes would have been of greater value had they been derived more from his empirical research. Historical expla- nation of cultural change constitutes an essential and irreducible aspect of archaeological interpretation. Yet the detailed insights that it provides into the com- plex processes that have produced specific aspects of the archaeological record also may draw attention to hitherto unrecognized processes that occur more generally. This too is a way of expanding the archae- ological imagination in a fashion that permits ar- chaeologists to move beyond superficial generaliza- tions about the processes of cultural change. CONCLUSION Philosophy has a 2,500-year tradition of studying how to construct arguments that promote clarity, depth, unity, and insight in the interpretation of data. It also has a long and distinguished tradition of in- vestigating how human beings understand the world around them and each other. This knowledge, which is highly elaborated in very complex, and sometimes arcane, language, is recognized by many social sci- entists to be of value for their work. Often, however, because philosophical treatments of issues are only partially understood by social scientists, what is known about them generates much confusion. This is not a reason to abandon contact between philos- ophy and the social sciences, but it is a challenge for social scientists to apply philosophical insights more knowledgeably and critically. Where archaeology and the other social sciences have a clear advantage over philosophy is in the realm of ontology: defining the nature of what there is to study as this applies to their own disciplines. Archae- ologists and social scientists share with philosophers a common-sense understanding of how human be- ings behave, but they also possess more specialized knowledge of the nature of human behavior based on research in the physical, biological, and social sciences. Many aspects of this understanding are highly controversial and keenly contested. Archae- ologists and physical anthropologists, because of their subject matter, tend to be more aware than are most other social scientists and philosophers that 164J.H.

TRIGGER, ARCHAEOLOGY AND EPISTEMOLOGY human beings, like all other animals, are a product of biological evolution and that their physiology, which includes the biological basis of their behav- ior, has evolved as a result of natural selection work- ing on available material. Hominid evolution has resulted in increasing dependence on learning, com- munication, and symbolic mediation, rather than on instinct and individual trial and error, as means to adapt to the natural and social environments. By making their behavior increasingly flexible and self- reflective, it has endowed human beings with an enor- mous selective advantage over other species. Pro- vided that an evolutionary perspective does not become biologically reductionist or ecologically de- terminist, it supplies a basis for evaluating and in- tegrating explanations of human behavior that is more focused and unified than are approaches that do not take account of how such behavior developed. The development of a cultural mode of adapta- tion means that while, as physical entities, each of us has the capacity to understand the emotions and feelings of all reasonably functional human beings, we are not anatomically equipped to understand the values, beliefs, and more symbolically influenced behavior of people who belong to other cultures. Since the Enlightenment, scholars, especially social anthropologists, have believed that the variation among existing cultures represented either the total range that was possible or an adequate sample of that variation. Today, as a result of the work of Eric Wolf and others, it is recognized that most cultures were modified as a consequence of European con- tact long before Europeans studied them.'68 Hence, social anthropology, despite its claim to be a general study of humanity, is starting to look more as if it were a science of acculturation. Only through his- tory and archaeology is there a possibility of ascer- taining the kinds of societies that existed in many parts of the world prior to the industrial revolution and everywhere prior to the beginnings of literacy. Archaeology is challenging social anthropology's long-standing claim to be the integrative core of the social sciences. At the same time, the social sciences are becoming increasingly dependent on archaeol- ogy's ability to infer ever more forms of behavior from the archaeological record and to reconstruct prehistoric societies for which there are not neces- sarily any living analogues. Any full explanation of human adaptation must consider not only human behavior but what goes on inside the human mind. Since humans do not adapt to reality directly, but only through each individual's conceptions of reality, any complete understanding of human behavior must take account of mental phenomena, which cannot be treated as a black box. The material expression of religious beliefs that bulks so large in the archaeological record is no less important for understanding human adap- tation than are stone and metal tools. It is also im- possible from an evolutionary perspective to treat the cognitive realm as autonomous from the mate- rial world. On the contrary, it has evolved, both as a biological potential and in its culturally specific expressions, as the means by which people adapt to their social and natural environments. The de- velopment of a capacity for culture, which facilitates humanity's ability to learn and to modify learned behavior, has greatly benefited humans by switching the main locus of selection from the whole organ- ism to individual beliefs and concepts. This does not, however, guarantee an idyllic world. Many ideas are maladaptive and those who, for whatever reason, persist in holding them must pay a price for doing so. The real world passes judgments on human ac- tions and on the ideas that underlie them. All of this favors an outlook that, while respecting the unique qualities of the human mind and its creations, is ontologically materialist and epistemologically realist.
