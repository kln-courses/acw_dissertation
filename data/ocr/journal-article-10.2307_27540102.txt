<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Effects of Anthropomorphism on Word Learning JAY BLANCHARD GEORGE McNINCH Texas Tech University West Georgia College ABSTRACT Anthropomorphism as a cue in word learning was investigated in relation to illustration and no picture cue conditions in trials to criterion and word memory tasks with kindergarten children. The study and test trials format of the study replicated similar studies but employed unique anthropomorphic cues with similar and dissimilar words. Analysis of variance was used to investigate differences among training conditions (anthropomorphic, illustration, and no picture) and word types (similar and dissimilar). Sig nificant differences were found between similar and dissimilar word types with the dissimilar words being learned more easily. Significant differences were found between training conditions with the anthropomorphic cues leading to enhanced learning and retention for both similar and dissimilar words. Anthropomorphism, a conventional writing and graphic technique, involves giving human qualities to non humans. In both the school and home environments, chil dren encounter many anthropomorphic characters in pic tures and stories as they learn to read (Blanchard, 1982). The most common sources of these anthropomorphic char acters have changed over the years from venerable classics in children's literature to anthropomorphic versions of typ ical family stories (e.g., Dick and Jane) and updated ver sions of classic selections in children's literature. These new sources reflect much of the content of beginning reading materials. The question for research seems obvious: Does this anthropomorphic situation create problems in early experience in learning to read? The research described here was designed to test the ef ficacy of a teacher introducing a new word in isolation with anthropomorphic pictorial information, a common practice in the development of sight vocabulary in schools (Burns &amp; Roe, 1980). Historical perspective. Anthropomorphism in its many forms has a long history. Early Greek civilizations (500 B.C.) are credited with the first discussions of the topic. From the Greek discussions to those of today, anthropo morphism has been viewed both as a literary technique and a psychological process. As a psychological process it is an attempt to deal with the unknown. In children it is an attempt to deal with a largely unknown world. In adults it is an attempt to deal with that which is unknown to society. There have been few research studies on anthropomorphism as a psychological process (Looft &amp; Bartz, 1969). As a literary technique, anthropomorphism has been a popular and very accommodating writing technique (Arbuthnot, 1972). When anthropomorphism as a literary technique and anthropomorphism as a psychological process are not con sidered as two constructs, but as one, they become inter twined with reading theory and reading instruction theory. Two fairly interesting facts seem to emerge from research taking into account the many aspects of anthropomorphism. First, familiarity with real world functions of anthropo morphized characters seems to reduce their impact (Ber zonsky, Ondrake, &amp; Williams, 1977; Looft &amp; Charles, 1969; Nass, 1956). Second, linguistic judgments sur rounding semantic and syntactic sentence correctness de velop in relation to a child's belief about what is real or unreal in life (Schwartz, 1980). Pictorial research. The role of illustrations or pictures as cues in prose learning is well documented, but this is not the case with word learning. In fact, few available re search studies (those that report statistically significant dif ferences) can be considered independent word learning re search, especially with regard to anthropomorphic cues (Levin &amp; Lesgold, 1978; Samuels, 1970). Word and prose learning research both involve some variation of a study- or learn-test paradigm. The few dif ferences between the two types of research usually occur during the study or learning trials. In prose learning study trials, the pupil learns to identify an unknown word em bedded in the context of supposedly known words (i.e., phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or short stories), either with or without pictorial information. In word learning study trials, the pupil learns to identify an unknown word in iso lation, either with or without pictorial information. The Address correspondence to Jay Blanchard, College of Educa tion, Texas Tech University, Box 4560, Lubbock, TX 79409. 105</page><page sequence="2">106 Journal of Educational Research distinctiveness of each approach to the study-test design is important because the test trials for both are similar, and involve the words, introduced in the study trials, being presented in isolation for identification without any pictorial information. Unfortunately, the distinctiveness in research approaches (word versus prose) seems to have gone unnoticed by many concerned with pictorial information research. Clearly, the contributions of each approach are important considerations when addressing the questions surrounding the use of pic torial information in learning to read; however, the conclu sions are different. Research on the effects of illustrations or pictures in prose learning, as mentioned earlier, has not been uncommon, and despite occasional disclaimers gen erally concludes that "pictures facilitate prose learning" (Levin &amp; Lesgold, 1978). Research on the effects of illustrations or pictures on word learning is less common than prose learning. Samuels (1967), Braun (1969), Harzen, Lee, and Miles (1976), Harris (1967), Dollinger and Walker (1978), and Singer, Samuels, and Spiroff (1974) report that pictorial informa tion can inhibit or interfere with word learning. On the other hand King and Muehl (1965), Montare, Elman, and Cohen (1977), Rohwer, Lynch, Levin, and Suzuki (1967), and Dilley and Paivio (1968) report that pictorial information enhances word learning. And, just to confuse the issue still further, Peeck (1974) reports that pictorial information nei ther inhibits nor enhances early word learning. This study is an attempt to add data to the base of in formation regarding picture cuing of word learning. More importantly, the study is an attempt to systematically eval uate anthropomorphism as a picture cue or prompt. Edu cationally, the question posed for the study can be reduced to asking what is the effect of an anthropomorphic cue on word learning experiences? Is anthropomorphism an in structional condition that will help a child learn to read an unknown word? In learning to read words, is there a dif ferential effect between materials prompted with anthro pomorphized or realistically illustrated materials, between aurally prompted or picture-cued words? Methods Subjects. For this study, 102 second semester kinder garten students were chosen from four suburban-rural schools in two states. To obtain the sample, students were screened on a letter recognition task to ensure that they were involved with learning and had completed some abstract verbal/visual experiences. Students who could not name all the letters used in the words of the study were excluded from further involvement. Additionally, students were screened on their ability to read any of the study/test words and any who could were dropped from further involvement. The researchers sought as subjects naive pupils who were capable of learning the words and completing the experi mental tests. Letter identification was used as a screening device and can be supported by Galocy (1969) who found that first graders' ability to recognize letters and names had a significant impact on later word learning. Letter recog nition as a screening device was piloted in an informal study prior to the research and it was found that pupils who could not correctly recognize the letters in the words often re sponded randomly to the study/test word learning tasks. Design. A 2 (word type) x 3 (condition) factorial design was used. Subjects were randomly assigned to either the similar or the dissimilar word group and further assigned in random order to one of the three training conditions (anthropomorphic cue, illustrated cue, or no-picture cue). Effects for word types, training conditions, and interaction could thus be investigated. Procedures Individually, subjects were administered a neutral study test warm-up task to acquaint them with the learning task and build background for the experiment. Three 5" by 8" index cards were used, each containing a color patch in the center of a rectangular box (3" x 4") with a word for each color typed in uppercase primary type letters below the box. The warm-up test trials consisted of three additional 5" x 8" index cards with the color patches omitted but with the rectangular box and the word remaining below the box. The experimental study-test trials used 5" x 8" laminated index cards with each card containing a rectangular box (3" x 4") with a word printed below in uppercase primary type. Pictorial information or the lack of it dictated the contents of the rectangular box for the experiment. Six sets of cards were employed, classified as either being in the similar (anthropomorphic, illustrated, no picture) or dissimilar (an thropomorphic, illustrated, no picture) group. Similar words were fork, frog, drum, and worm. Dissimilar words were belt, comb, fish, and duck. As can be seen, the similar and dissimilar words are high-frequency concrete nouns with what would appear to be equivalent sensory image evoking strengths (Dilley &amp; Paivio, 1968). They were ho mogeneous in word length and medial vowel position and were selected based on the following criteria: that they were suitable for illustration, present in the students' oral and listening language backgrounds, of equal lengths, and could be learned by kindergarten students. The similar words share salient graphic and phonemic cues (Marchbanks &amp; Levin, 1965) and the consonant "r" in the medial position. These similarities obviously do not exist in the dissimilar words (see King &amp; Muehl, 1965, and Hartley, 1970, for additional information on the selection process for similar and dissimilar words). Anthropomorphic cue cards were hand drawn cartoon style characters displaying at least five human attributes. According to the work of Duchastel and Waller (1979) an thropomorphic cues of these types are referred to as atten tional illustrations. Generally, attentional illustrations maintain the learner's attention to the task of reading. It</page><page sequence="3">November/December 1984 [Vol. 78(No. 2)1 107 makes the reading task more enriching and agreeable while it develops interest. Illustration cue cards were factual, explicative illustra tions of the actual object from My First Picture Dictionary (1970) obtained by permission of the Scott, Foresman Com pany. Duchastel and Waller (1979) present evidence that a factual or explicative illustration shows what an object looks like and helps to explain or clarify. The no-picture cue cards contained only a 3" x 4" rect angular box on each. The study-test trial cards for each of the six experimental treatments were bound on a ring in random order following a study-test sequence. Each subject learned one set of four words. The study sequence for the anthropomorphic and illus tration cued tasks in the experiment was controlled by asking the pupil to look at the picture, point to the word, and pronounce the word. If a correct pronunciation was not received in seven seconds, the subject was shown the next card. Regardless of whether the word was pronounced cor rectly or incorrectly a correct pronunciation was always given by the experimenter. The study sequence for the no picture cued tasks in the experiment was controlled by asking the subject to look at the word, point to the word, and pronounce the word. The same experimental word pro nunciation procedures were followed with the no-picture subjects. (It should be remembered that the first time through the word cards, for the no-picture subjects the words were unknown and the experimenter had to pro nounce all words.) The test sequences for all six experi mental treatments were the same, as were the test cards. The laminated 5" x 8" index cards contained only a rect angular box and a typed word. During the test trials, no feedback of any type was given by the experimenter. Learning was said to have occurred when two adjacent trials were completed correctly. The study-test sequence was dis continued when 12 trials were completed without learning all the words. Correct responses were recorded for each trial; thus, two scores were available for analysis; trials to criterion and the number of correct responses. Results Two independent 2 (word type) x 3 (condition) AN OVAS were utilized: the first dependent variable was trials to criterion and the second was total number of correct responses on test trials. Trials to criterion. Table 1 presents the means and stan dard deviations for each of the main effects. The ANO VA (Table 2) resulted in a significant main effect of word type. The mean scores indicated that dissimilar words (X = 6.10) required significantly fewer trials to learn than the similar words (X = 7.70). As can be seen in Figure 1, the anthro pomorphic cues resulted in enhanced learning rates when compared to illustrated and no-picture cues. As mentioned, the similar words were more difficult to learn but the an thropomorphic cues and the no-picture cues resulted in en Table 1.?Means and Standard Deviations for Word Types and Training Conditions by Trials to Criterion and Correct Responses Trials to Criterion N X SD Dissimilar Word Types Training conditions anthropomorphic 17 5.60 3.20 illustrated 17 6.20 3.50 no picture 17 6.50 3.40 Similar Word Types anthropomorphic 17 7.30 4.40 illustrated 17 8.50 3.90 no picture 17 7.40 4.20 Correct Response Dissimilar Word Types Training conditions anthropomorphic 17 41.50 7.52 illustrated 17 38.00 10.97 no picture 17 33.60 13.10 Similar Word Types anthropomorphic 17 32.80 15.67 illustrated 17 26.70 15.68 no picture 17 32.70 13.45 hanced learning rates when compared to illustrated cues only. Correct response. Table 1 presents the means and the standard deviations for each of the main effects. The ANOVA (Table 3) resulted in a significant main effect of word type. The mean scores indicated that subjects _were able to retain significantly more dissimilar words (X = 37.70) than similar words (X = 30.73). Despite the results indicating non-significant condition means, methods for making multiple comparisons and testing the significance of them are available and appropriate (Edwards, 1972). (This option was not available on trials to criterion data because of restricted score ranges.) Duncan's new multiple range test (p &lt; 0.05) was used to determine the means between which significant differences existed. Concerning the similar word type groups, it was found that anthropo morphic cues helped the subjects retain a significantly greater proportion of the words when compared to the other two cue conditions. And, the other cue conditions did not differ significantly from each other. Concerning the dissimilar words, it was found that the anthropomorphic and no-picture cue groups differed sig nificantly from the illustrated cue group, and the anthro pomorphic and no-picture cue groups did not differ signif icantly from each other. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates the superiority of anthropomorphic cues (X = 41.50) in the retention of dissimilar words over illustrated (X = 38.00) and no-picture (X = 33.60) cues. Concerning similar words, the anthropomorphic (X = 32.80) and no-picture (X = 32.70) cues appear to aid retention more than illus trated (X = 26.70) cues only. In addition, Figures 1 and 2 graphically demonstrate that little difference exists between trials to criterion or retention test scores of similar or dis similar words if no picture cues are provided.</page><page sequence="4">108 Journal of Educational Research Table 2.?Analysis of Variance for Effect of Treatment by Training Condition Employing Trials to Criterion Source SS DF MS F p Word types 70.88 1 70.88 4.83 &lt; .05 Training conditions 12.41 2 6.21 .42 NS Interaction 7.90 2 3.95 .27 NS Residual 1407.06 96 14.66 ? ?

Conclusions The primary thrust of the study was to investigate the impact of anthropomorphic cues on word learning. Cues involved were anthropomorphic, explicative-illustration, and no picture (only voice cue). While there were no sig nificant differences for the main effects of training condi tion (cue procedures), post hoc multiple comparison tests revealed there were significant differences on the retention of learned words favoring anthropomorphic cues over il lustrated cues regardless of word types. While post hoc comparison tests were not appropriate for trials to criterion data, descriptive statistics seem to point to basically the same conclusion. While there has been a paucity of research involving anthropomorphic cues in word learning, this has not de terred the inclusion of anthropomorphism, with increasing magnitude, in childhood reading instruction materials. Much needs to be done concerning investigations sur rounding anthropomorphism and its effects on young learners. This study, then, can only offer tentative hy potheses to account for the results. Why were anthropomorphic cues superior to the other cuing conditions in learning rate and retention for dissimilar words? Dissimilar words have less intra-list confusion than similar words. It seems almost a fact in word learning re search that a dissimilar group of words is easier to learn and remember than a similar group of words (Rothkopf, 1958; Samuels &amp; Jeffrey, 1966; Underwood, 1953). Per haps anthropomorphic cues are superior to explicative-il lustrated and no-picture cue conditions because as atten tional cues, they do just that: focus attention. Some might speculate that anthropomorphic cues, since they contain a variety of stimuli, might inhibit word learning because they focus attention away from the word to be learned. Such does not seem the case with young learners in this study. Figure 1.?Mean Trials to Criterion: Training Conditions x Word Types anthropomorphic illustrated similar m 22 dissimilar no picture</page><page sequence="5">November/December 1984 {Vol. 78(No. 2)1 b o u 40 35 30 25 anthropomorphic illustrated Figure 2.?Mean Correct Response: Training Conditions x Word Types 109 similar m dissimilar '4L no picture Indeed, it seems possible to suggest that anthropomorphic cues activate what is undoubtedly a myriad of human sche mata (as opposed to only relevant object schemata in the explicative-illustrations and no-picture cue conditions) that help the learner focus attention on the word. The attention or focusing process that leads to the human schemata ac tivation occurs because of a universal, but misdirected ten dency in young learners to ascribe humanness to non-hu mans. This process focuses consciousness and attention while probably engaging imagery or organization processes that can contribute to the active elaboration of words in memory. The elaboration affects depth of processing (Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972) as well as storage and recall (Lesgold, McCormick, &amp; Golinkoff, 1975). Since it is doubtful that the schemata activation process is an either-or situation, this hypothesis could be tested by either varying the number of relevant anthropomorphic cues available and recognizable to the learner or using age as an independent variable. (It should be noted with regard to the last point that the use of anthropomorphic cues, as an activation agent for human schemata, is probably a transient phenomenon and would be abandoned in most children as anthropomorphism gives way to a more naturalistic view of life.) Why were anthropomorphic cues and no-picture cues su perior in learning and retention for similar words? Similar words have more intra-list confusion than dissimilar words. Hence, the schemata activation processes of the anthropo morphic cues are diminished by the attentional demands of learning similar words. The anthropomorphic cues are at a point of rough equivalency with the no-picture cues, but with both still superior to the illustrated cues. Perhaps the schemata activation process was made difficult because of the attentional demands required by similar words. Since the no-picture cue condition was superior to the illustrated cue condition, it seems possible to hypothesize that the degree to which illustrated cues seem to distract from the necessary attentional demands for similar words is com pensated for by the increased attentional facilities of the anthropomorphic cues. No-picture cues (and anthropo morphic cues) are superior to explicative-illustrations in word learning and retention for similar words (Samuels, 1967). However, such a conclusion is only partially gener alizaba to dissimilar words since word retention data in dicates that anthropomorphic and illustrated cues were su perior to no-picture cues. Why were the no-picture cue conditions seemingly un affected by the use of similar and dissimilar words? While the dissimilar words required fewer trials to learn and re sulted in more words learned, as can be seen in figures 1 and 2 these differences were slight. Evidently, the addi tional attention burdens of the similar words do not place undue responsibilities on the learner if a picture or expli cative illustration is not present. In conclusion, the positive effects of anthropomorphic cues on word learning and retention indicate that in word learning research with young learners it is the type and content of the picture that controls the effects (Levin &amp; Lesgold, 1978). Thus, it appears that the recent trend to ward pictorialized anthropomorphic characters and dialogue in word learning situations can not be expected to have a deleterious effect on word learning. The implication for educational practices, as well as publishers, is that the an thropomorphic trend does not harm word learning among young learners. REFERENCES Arbuthnot, M. H. (1972).
