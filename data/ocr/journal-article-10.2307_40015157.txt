<plain_text><page sequence="1">ETHICAL NATURALISM AND INDIGENOUS CULTURES Introduction Robin W. Lovin and Frank E. Reynolds Abstract Comparative ethics raises theoretical and methodological problems im- portant for all ethical studies. Five essays in this focus section provide introductions to the ethics of specific indigenous cultures and suggest implications for further comparative studies. In this introduction, we review these findings and discuss their relevance to the concept of ethi- cal naturalism which we have previously offered as a basis for compara- tive work. Recent years have seen extensive development of the field of com- parative religious ethics. Methodological essays that concentrate on the implications of comparative work for ethical theory (Little and Twiss 1978), systematic works that test theoretical claims in a variety of cultural settings (Green 1978, 1988), and historical studies that attempt serious cross-cultural comparisons of major intellectual sys- tems (Yearley 1990) have all contributed to this growth of compara- tive studies in religious ethics. The Journal of Religious Ethics has provided a forum for these discus- sions for more than a decade (see Bird et ai 1981). In a previous//?Â£ Focus, we introduced three articles on cosmogony and comparative ethics, together with an assessment by Charles Reynolds and Ronald Green of the theoretical issues raised in those essays (see Lovin and Reynolds 1986). The treatment of Aztec cosmogony and ethics, in particular, sparked further discussion (Green and Reynolds 1986; Read 1987). The Ethics of Indigenous Cultures This Focus section continues the exploration of these issues through studies of what are sometimes called "primitive" or "tradi- tional" cultures. None of those conventional labels seems quite ap- propriate to the variety and complexity of these communities. 267</page><page sequence="2">268 The Journal of Religious Ethics "Primitive" suggests, falsely, that their beliefs and practices are either simple or lacking in historical development. Identifying these cultures as "traditional" implies, oddly, that they are shaped by tra- dition, while other cultures are not. In this introduction, we will, for simplicity, speak of "indigenous" cultures and religions, though that is also misleading. Perhaps no single designation can cover cultures from West Africa to the South Pacific and from the Arctic Circle to Tierra del Fuego. What the myths, beliefs, and rituals described in these essays have in common, at any rate, is that they have developed until quite re- cently without a written language. The studies focus, therefore, on relatively small communities bounded by the limits of spoken com- munication and collective memory, although they are often con- nected in complex ways to larger linguistic and ethnic groupings. In addition, the material culture of the peoples studied in these essays often does not provide much control over the effects of seasonal changes, variations in food supply, and the unpredictable results of small-scale agriculture or local hunting expeditions. Indeed, these essays show how ritual observances and material culture are often shaped by responsiveness to these natural contingencies. Finally, each of the cultures considered by these authors has been changed in significant ways by the encounter with modern Western technology and society, including Western religions. We must be cautious, therefore, in ascribing features of these cultures as they presently exist to the cultures that supposedly existed before that contact. Those general characteristics of small-scale community and a way of life shaped both by natural forces and by significant dislocations in the encounter with Western modernity are shared by the cultures surveyed in these essays. They are in other respects as different from one another as they are from the academic culture of the authors. Tod Swanson studies the impact of seasonal changes on moral life and moral reflection among indigenous peoples in North and South America. Laura Ketekou Grillo studies the use of divination among the Dogon people of Mali, in West Africa, demonstrating that these ritualized practices serve as a way of relating specific events and choices to a larger cosmic system in which they take on moral mean- ing for the actors. Mary MacDonald traces the cosmogonic myths of the Kewa of Papua New Guinea to show how their beliefs about ori- gins provide systematic connections among cosmic order, individual physiology, and the culture's moral values and expectations. Susan Staiger Gooding discusses the ethical resonances of multiple tellings of cosmogonic myths among the Salishan-speaking Native Americans</page><page sequence="3">Ethical Naturalism and Indigenous Cultures 269 who live in the interior of the Pacific Northwest along the U.S./Cana- dian border. John Grim focuses on a specific Salishan-speaking com- munity, showing how their contemporary practice of the Winter Dance ritual reflects and communicates a "synthetic" ethic that em- phasizes both giving and empathy. Modern Thinking about Indigenous Ethics Although these essays recount the traditional knowledge of the in- digenous cultures they study and require that the reader be intro- duced to some very specific anthropological investigations, they also immediately involve the student of ethics in a number of more gen- eral questions about moral judgment and moral community. Indeed, comparative religious ethics brings into sharp relief a set of theoreti- cal and methodological questions that are implicit in all study of ethics. The difficulties inherent in interpreting any moral belief in its so- cial context are often heightened in comparative studies by difficul- ties in obtaining accurate historical and ethnographic information about both the beliefs and the context. Comparative study also raises questions about what ethics is, so that it becomes difficult to specify even what the object of study is without recourse to the inves- tigator's own theory of morality - explicit or implicit. The controver- sies in comparative religious ethics suggest that there is no such thing as pure "descriptive ethics." Even the most objective account of the morality of particular groups or persons is shaped by some prior understanding of what morality is. Comparative study is thus shaped to some extent by the observer's own ethical theory, implicit or explicit. This is often painfully appar- ent to today's reader in the early modern defense of "rational morals" against "primitive morality." The "primitive," it was said, responds to awe and fear of supernatural powers. Rational moral behavior is motivated by kindlier emotions of human sympathy and a prudent assessment of self-interest. David Hume's Natural History of Religion traces the origins of a whole range of false beliefs about the world of nature on which the "primitive" fear depends, and Hume concludes that once we have dispelled these false, conflicting, and sometimes cruel beliefs about nature, it will be clear that "nothing can preserve untainted the genuine principles of morals in our judg- ment of human conduct, but the absolute necessity of these princi- ples to the existence of society" (Hume [1779] 1927, 278). A reasoned utilitarianism is not only sufficient for human morality; it is the only secure foundation for it.</page><page sequence="4">270 The Journal of Religious Ethics Later writers evidenced greater appreciation for the ethics of in- digenous cultures. The complaints of both clerics and philosophers during the eighteenth century against savagery and superstition gave way in the nineteenth to an esteem for the unadorned virtues and simpler way of life among these peoples uncorrupted by civilization. A romantic vision of the their nobility and wisdom, rather than Hume's "barbarous and necessitous animal" (Hume [1779] 1927, 256), became the paradigm of indigenous moral life. It was not merely that the European image of indigenous cultures changed. The development of scientific anthropology also contrib- uted to a more accurate description of them. The shocking reports of early travelers sometimes proved unfounded. More important, as Alexander Macbeath pointed out in his 1948 Gifford lectures on comparative ethics, a holistic approach to other cultures often ren- dered understandable practices that seemed inexplicable or cruel when taken in isolation (Macbeath 1952, 18-22). More complete knowledge of the moral beliefs and practices of other peoples and of the cultural systems of which they are a part leads to a greater appre- ciation of indigenous ethics. Modern moral theorists, meanwhile, had discerned another funda- mental problem for the idea of comparative ethics. Though it might be true that investigation reveals in indigenous cultures a compre- hensive set of moral practices linked to a reasonable system of beliefs about human beings and their place in a larger cosmic order, such descriptions do not, in themselves, provide any information about what morality ought to be. As a result, the moral life of indigenous peoples has few direct lessons for our own. In 1954, Richard Brandt published Hopi Ethics, one of the first im- portant efforts at comparative ethics in contemporary philosophy. Brandt provides a thoughtful phenomenology and psychology of Hopi moral life, but from the outset, he warns us against drawing hasty philosophical conclusions. Where earlier observers rushed to draw moral implications from the observation of indigenous ethics, Brandt cautiously allows that "the facts about primitive peoples have some implications which, directly or indirectly, are of not negligible import for the interest of philosophers" (Brandt 1954, 10). The in- formation which the ethicist gains from the anthropologist is primar- ily a stimulus to reflection. We may learn from skilled observation what the moral practices of other peoples are, and how these prac- tices are connected in their cultures to shared ideas and beliefs, but knowing that will not tell what the moral philosopher wants to know. It will tell us neither whether a proposed course of action is moral for us nor even what it means for us to call something moral.</page><page sequence="5">Ethical Naturalism and Indigenous Cultures 271 The problem of comparative ethics, according to Brandt, is not just that it is difficult to understand a specific moral practice in isola- tion from the cultural matrix in which it exists. The problem is the fundamental logical difference between a description of what the moral beliefs of a culture are and a justification of those beliefs. An accurate account of what people believe to be morally justified may be difficult to obtain, especially if they are separated from us by wide differences of time or culture. It may even be difficult to determine whether they have an idea that corresponds to our concept of moral justification. Success in obtaining answers to those questions may be an important achievement, but it will not settle the question of moral justification itself. Theory and Description Brandt's sharp distinction between descriptive ethics and the justi- fication of a moral system is conceptually clear, but it often is blurred when writers get down to cases about particular cultures and their moral beliefs. Contemporary writers who are concerned about the human stresses and environmental threats imposed by modern life often describe the straightforward virtues and simple lives of people in indigenous cultures in ways that make their character out to be a choiceworthy alternative to the excesses and vices of modern Euro-American society. Popular films, such as Dances with Wolves, and even alternative cuisines (Kleiman 1991) present themselves as representations of the values of indigenous cultures, but they may have more value as a moral critique of the dominant culture than as descriptions of other possibilities. In any case, admiration is not justification. To praise other peo- ple's virtues requires not only a knowledge of what they value, but also a morality of one's own by which to determine that their virtues are indeed praiseworthy. The fact that these moral convictions of the observer are often unexpressed does not make them any less es- sential to the process. Nor does one escape Brandt's problem by a rigorous descriptive method, for one must have at least an implicit theory of what morality is to know what one wants to describe. Those who conceive a moral system as based on the rules of a nor- mative logic will likely go looking for it in judgments rendered by authoritative leaders or encoded in traditional rules. They may miss altogether the physiological speculation that Mary MacDonald iden- tifies as the center of Kewa morality, or the cosmological order through which, as Laura Grillo shows, Dogon divination contextual- izes important individual choices.</page><page sequence="6">272 The Journal of Religious Ethics Brandt may have expected too little moral learning from our ex- amination of the morality of indigenous peoples, but his crucial dis- tinction between description and justification alerts us that what we learn will be reliable only if we have identified our own moral theory and understood how it affects our implicit evaluations and our de- scriptions of the cultures we observe. An eighteenth-century colo- nialist's smug sense of moral superiority to the "uncivilized" peoples whose beliefs fail the utilitarian test illustrates this point in an obvi- ous way, but so, and more subtly, does Macbeath's twentieth-century conviction that indigenous moralities are important because they en- able us to see the limitations of contemporary ethical theories (Macbeath 1952, 17). In each case, the possibility not only of critical judgment, but even of coherent description turns on the observer's understanding of what morality is. Contemporary work in comparative ethics is marked by an aware- ness of this complex interaction between moral theory and observa- tion. The hope for a neat division of labor between the moral theorist and the descriptive anthropologist or historian of religions is replaced by a recognition that everyone who attempts this task must master at least some of both sorts of disciplines. In these essays, the descriptive skills predominate, but attention to moral theory is also evident in each of them, ranging from Tod Swanson's explicit com- parison of indigenous and modern ethics to John Grim's elucidation of the ethics of giving and the ethics of empathy that jointly shape the practices of the Winter Dance ritual. Ethical Naturalism To understand what the authors of this focus section have to say about indigenous ethics, then, we must not only appropriate the de- scriptions of indigenous cultures that they offer us. We must also understand the ethical theories which shape their observations. These authors generally identify their theoretical perspectives as versions of "ethical naturalism." That is, they begin their effort to understand the moral beliefs and practices of indigenous cultures guided by the idea that morally correct choices are those which en- able persons and communities to flourish within constraints and pos- sibilities set by the general requirements of human nature and the particular conditions of their own lives (Lovin and Reynolds 1985, 1- 35). The ethical naturalist rejects the formalism which in modern moral theory often abstracts moral judgments from other sorts of desiring and valuing. On the other hand, the ethical naturalist also rejects the subjectivism and relativism that commonly provide the al- ternatives to ethical formalism.</page><page sequence="7">Ethical Naturalism and Indigenous Cultures 273 The authors of these essays obviously value narratives and myths. They offer extensive accounts of the stories in which indigenous peo- ples formulate their moral insights and explain the order of the world as they experience it. Yet these are not essays in "narrative ethics." What is important is the interaction between natural condi- tions and moral evaluations expressed in the myths. Where other observers might see a closed system of narratives that structures the possibilities for moral experience, these authors stress the way in which the moral judgments implicit in the stories mirror the exper- ienced limits and possibilities of their own natural and social world. Ethical naturalism, which is a moral theory, is thus quite different from the reductionism often associated with "naturalism" simpliciter. Ethical naturalism must include an appreciation of a world of human experience that cannot be reduced to empirical facts. What the ethi- cal naturalist insists is that despite the diversity of narrative and in- terpretive systems through which peoples and cultures recount this world of experience, the limits and possibilities are sufficiently simi- lar to render moral judgments and choices intelligible across the boundaries between cultures. The terminology of "ethical naturalism" may be no more satisfac- tory as a way to capture the nuances of these authors' perspectives than the terminology of "indigenous ethics" is to designate the ob- jects of their interest. For the most part, however, Swanson, Grillo, MacDonald, Gooding, and Grim do not aim to refine the concept of ethical naturalism, but to use it as the starting point for their own descriptive efforts. It is possible to profit from a reading of these essays without any prior commitment to ethical naturalism and the nuances that distinguish it from other theories of ethics. The reader needs to understand ethical naturalism only when critical questions arise about why just these aspects of indigenous cultures, and not some others, are taken as the primary locus of ethical expression. Further reflection may lead to additional questions about ethical naturalism, at least to the extent that the reader wants to probe how his or her own ideas square with the ideas that shaped these observa- tions. Questions emerge about whether ethical naturalism provides an adequate basis for the comparative enterprise and whether it ade- quately encompasses the full range of concerns that must be in- cluded in a moral orientation that accounts for the realities of our own modern world. Learning from Indigenous Ethics Our remarks thus far should serve to clarify the understanding of the relationship between theory and observation that shapes these</page><page sequence="8">274 The Journal of Religious Ethics essays. Attentiveness to the problems of modern ethical theory ren- ders problematic any approach to comparative ethics that claims to take a purely descriptive approach to the moral life of traditions and cultures. To speak about the ethics of a community is also, at least implicitly, to make a statement about what ethics is, and that state- ment will always be potentially controversial - in the modern aca- demic culture in which it is made as well as in the culture under observation. As we observed at the outset, it is this inescapable con- nection between comparison and the questions of ethical theory that makes comparative religious ethics an important center of scholarly interest today, even for those ethicists whose work does not directly involve comparative studies. We conclude these introductory remarks by returning to the ques- tion which modern scholars have raised in one form or another since the beginning of their attention to other ways of living the moral life. To adopt Brandt's modest formulation of the possibilities, what do we find in comparative studies that provides those "implications which, directly or indirectly, are of not negligible import" to our own moral thinking (Brandt 1954, 10)? Swanson, Grillo, MacDonald, Gooding, and Grim clearly share the conviction that there are important lessons to be learned from the peoples whose myths and rituals they have observed. Their reports are guided by the methods and conventions of ethnographic objec- tivity, and they avoid the romantic admiration of particular virtues and practices isolated from their cultural contexts. Much of what they share with the cultures they have studied is an aesthetic sensitiv- ity: an enjoyment of particular kinds of stories, a delight in the tastes and textures of food, or love of a particular landscape. However, there is also evident in these essays a moral approval as well: an acknowledgment that in knowing what makes for the good life of a Papago, Kewa, Dogon, or Salishan Indian, we learn something about what makes a good life for ourselves. Tod Swanson's study of American Indian ethics identifies this learning most directly, though we see aspects of it in all of these essays. For Indian peoples it is not the limits of a universal human nature that are ethically relevant, but the limits of Papago nature, Hopi nature, Cal- deron Quichua nature. The Papago (their name, Tohono O'odham, means "Desert People") have a Desert People character because the limits of their endurance have been stretched and fixed by the seasonal move- ment of their particular part of the Sonoran desert. By contrast the Pima, or River People, are recognized as a distinct people (even though</page><page sequence="9">Ethical Naturalism and Indigenous Cultures 275 they speak the same language) because their limits have been fixed by the different environment of the Gila River [Swanson, 293]. There is in the moral life of these peoples an interest in the details of life that is often lost in modern moral thought. What the authors in this focus section seem to admire most in the moral traditions they have observed is the attention to particulars. Moral life is shaped, not just by the conditions of human life in general, but by the specific conditions under which this people now has to live, and even by the seasonal variations that mark off one time of year, with its own enjoy- ments and challenges, from the enjoyments and challenges of other times of the year. In the authors' culture, of course, many of these variations are moderated or eliminated by technological means, and the possibility of removing oneself to another location and another way of life is always present. We continue to take note of seasons and regions, often, indeed, accentuating them for commercial purposes, but we rarely see them as matters of moral significance. By contrast, the emphasis in the focus essays is on the particularity of moral questions and moral roles. Divination, for the Dogon, is a way of deciding what one person, constrained by quite specific cir- cumstances, ought to do. Modern people often ask similar ques- tions, of course, but we have difficulty conceptualizing them as properly moral. The stories of the Interior Salishan peoples involve mythic animals and people whose actions give the natural landscape and its non-human inhabitants a moral character. Moral assessments pertain to quite specific relationships between very different kinds of characters. What is right for one may not be right for another, or not right in relation to a different character. Modern people tend to la- bel such sensibilities "anthropomorphic," treating them as a distrac- tion from the assessment of human relationships which, when they are properly moral, treat all who can enter into the specified relation- ship as equals. In short, the essays in this focus section present us with moral worlds that are structured in ways quite different from the world of modern Western ethics. In general, in the ethics of indigenous peo- ples the moral world is expanded to include animals and elements of the natural environment, while the moral roles available in this ex- panded universe are particularized, denned by the character and en- vironment of specific persons and groups. In modern Western ethics, by contrast, the moral world tends to be restricted to the human world, while the roles available within it are universalized.</page><page sequence="10">276 The Journal of Religious Ethics To be a moral being is to play a part that is not denned by the specif- ics of one's own character or desires. The differences between modern Western ethics and the ethics of indigenous peoples are profound, but they are not total. If they were, we would not even be able to frame an ethical theory that would allow us to pick out what the Dogon diviner or the Salishan storyteller does as "ethics." The attention to particularity and indi- vidual variations that characterizes indigenous ethics has its counter- part in the Western tradition in Aristotle's formulation, early in the Nicomachean Ethics, that ethics is deliberation about contingent mat- ters. Ethics attempts to make wise choices about things that could be otherwise, rather than to understand things that must be as they are (Aristotle 1941, 969). The focus on human universals in modern moral thought has lately been criticized for contributing to moral neglect of non-human species and the natural environment, but it also reflects a modern preoccupation with what Aristotle would perhaps have identified as "speculative" or "theoretical" questions, rather than with the contin- gent, which is the proper realm of moral deliberation. The modern questions are not speculative in a way that makes them irrelevant or trivial, nor are they remote from human concerns. They reflect a modern critical consciousness that wants to know the transcendental conditions of human life that make possible all of the variety and contingency that we experience. They also bespeak a modern anxi- ety that the universe as a whole may be hostile to human projects in a way that indigenous peoples seem only rarely to have conceived. It would be romanticism of the worst sort to suppose that we could evade these distinctly modern questions by taking refuge in a moral universe in which they do not arise. The study of indigenous ethics may, however, call our attention to details of the moral life that only come into focus when those questions about the transcendental cir- cumstances of our lives are temporarily suspended. It may be that the particular roles and contingent choices that dominate the problems of indigenous ethics have real moral significance only if the natural world of our experience does have the order and coherence about which modern accounts raise critical questions. We cannot escape the question whether the world really does sup- port our moral aims, but neither should we overlook the fact that most of our moral life is spent, not in asking the question about meaning, but in deciding which course of action to take on the as- sumption that the choice makes a real difference. A recovery of the</page><page sequence="11">Ethical Naturalism and Indigenous Cultures 277 attention to particulars found in indigenous ethics, and also in cer- tain periods in the history of the Western tradition, may make it pos- sible to craft a version of ethical naturalism that will be closer to the actual contours of the moral life - in indigenous cultures and in our own.
