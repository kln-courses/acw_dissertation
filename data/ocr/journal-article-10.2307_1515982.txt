<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEROME'S TREATMENT OF AN ANTHROPOPATHISM BY RAPHAEL LOEWE Leeds In piam memoriam STANLEY ARTHUR COOK l;w": ;nn;»7 nr» 2nmn The direct influence of rabbinical exegesis on St. Jerome's biblical translations is recognised, and has often been demonstrated by the adducing of parallels. 1) More significant, however, are solecisms or peculiarities in Jerome's renderings that argue for his having thought on parallel lines to Jewish scholars even though evidence of direct influence on any particular passage is not forthcoming. Such simi- larities, although much more elusive, when they can be authenticated bespeak a subtler influence and suggest that Jerome may have been more steeped in rabbinic ideas than posterity has recognised, or than he himself might have been disposed to admit. Caution has to be exercised in searching for such evidence, since parallels between Jerome and the Rabbis may be mutually independent and derive from a common source. This seems to be the explanation for the similarity of treatment accorded by Jerome and Sa'adiah to the word t117Y when the eternity of God is concerned; it is scarcely possible that Sa'adiah has been influenced by the Latin Bible, and specific earlier rabbinic evidence is not forthcoming. Jerome and Sacadiah both seem to depend here on a common, and as yet unidentified, neo-platonic source. 2) The present note is intended to draw attention to a tendency evinced by Jerome when confronted with the Hebrew root n13f in certain contexts, and to compare his treatment of it with that 1) M.

Mnr, which in the Picel and Pu'al means to comfort and to be comforted, is used also in the Niph'al and Hithpa'el; here, in addition to the passive meaning, there is a semantic development (or rather jump) from consoling oneself to the idea of being sorry, repenting of, or ruing an action, and hence it comes to mean repent of an action and change one's mind. In this sense it is applied in the Bible indifferently to God and man; meaning to be comforted or comfort oneself it is used of God in three passages (Is. i 24, lvii 6, Ezek. v 13). The embarrassment of the Targumists when confronted by an- thropomorphisms is familiar, and led them to various periphrases - the most obvious being the introduction of God's Word, the R'lO, and the rendering of active verbs of sense perception, when applied in the text to God, by passive constructions: when in Ex. iii 19, God says, D11l', "I know", this becomes in Targum Onkelos "revelatum est coram me" ('2 'tYIIn) 1). Similar, but not so far reaching scruples are to be detected in parts of the Septuagint, especially in the Pentateuch and the Psalms. 2) But scarcely less diffi- cult than anthropomorphism from the theological point of view, and even more intractable to a translator concerned with theological tendency rather than literalism, is the imputation to the Deity of anthropopathetic reactions-at least, of the "unworthy" ones. In such cases the Targumists, concerned principally with unexceptionable theology and the instruction of the laity in how to meet popular controversy, may substitute a different verb entirely. 3) An analysis of the targumic renderings of ntl in the Niph'al and Hithpa'el when it means to repent and change one's purpose, shows that where man is concerned the Targum uses the root in3 itself three times. 4) In two other places 5) it uses 111, to return, which is also the root used in the majority of cases 1) Similarly "in the eyes of the Lord" regularly in Onkelos becomes "before the Lord" ('"1 t:p'), e.g. Gen. vi 8. Ib. xxi 17 "God heard" becomes "and there was heard before the Lord" ('l t1l'p Y1l7 ). 2) See CHARLES T. FRITSCH, The Anti-anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch, (Princeton, 1943), esp. p. 17 ff.

Gen. viii 21 (and the Lord smelled a sweet savour) becomes (Onkelos) "and the Lord accepted with favour his offering".

In a few instances the regular rendering :111 is replaced by another root. 2) The Samaritan text is in agreement with the massoretic in the pentateuchal occurrences, and the Samaritan Targum generally treats these passages as circumspectly as the Jewish Targums do -although the root is retained in Ex. xxxii 12 and 14 (n11nSX1), in Gen. vi 6 and 7 we find 'I. f3 ';1 n n 111, K'1T r nn3f nx, which WALTON translates "inflatus est", in Deut. xxxii 26 '1310' ("cogitabit"-WALToN), and in Numbers xxiii 19 '1nn . The latter, the reading of WALTON and PETERMANN 3), is confirmed by the Barberini Triglot (MS Vat. Sam. 2) of which a photostat copy is available in the Semitics Department at Leeds University. The Bodleian MS printed by NuTT 4) reads ("n) WIn1. WALTON renders rinnl poenitet ipsum: we should presumably restore 1n1V1 (cf. note 2 below. CASTELL, Lexicon Heptaglotton, vol. II, col. 3873 iden- tifies the two). The Nablus Triglot transcribed at the beginning of this century for P. KAI,LE, of which transcription a copy is also a- vailable at Leeds, reads B1n1O10 (cf. Deut. xxxii 26 cited above, also for nnUl"). The targumic renderings thus evince a fairly con- sistent reluctance to allow that biblical language, when it employs :113 of God, can admit of the possibility. of His changing His purpose either of His own volition or through the operation of any external cause. With regard to rabbinical exegesis proper, as opposed to paraphrastic translation, it may be noted in passing that of the comments offered in Midrash Genesis Rabbah § 27, 4 on Gen. vi 6 5) those of Rabbi Nehemiah and Rabbi Levi seem to rest upon the same sense of impropriety. 1) Jer. xx 16. 2) Ex. xiii 17 (Onkelos) of man 113W1T (quake); Deut. xxxii 26 (Onkelos) 1Srn11 (take punishment, vengeance); Ezek. xxiv 14 (Jonathan) of God Q"'nNk (love, have mercy) (taking 13nI as tnlX,cf.below, pp.264,269). The Targum Pseu- do Jonathan (ed. M.

The verbs used by the LXX for God not changing His mind are (ignoring the negative) (1) pzravoe'v (also used of man), (2) (JrapA o-ral, (3) a&amp;retLXecOa (Num. xxiii 19), (4) &amp;ivLeva (Jer. xv 6), (5) eseiv (Ezek. xxiv 14); and positively, (6) v'OupZa30RoL (Gen. vi 6), (7) O0u±po5oot (Gen. vi 7), (8) xapacxaXeocaL,, (1) seravooLv,, (these last two most frequently), (9) trauCaOaL (Jer. xxvi 3), (9a) ou Trauc0aOaL (Is. i 24- a counsel of despair on the part of the translator) 1), (10) &amp;aMvTraue60aL (Jer. xlii 10), (11) 'xeo; yLyVEOaLt (Ex. xxxii 2), (12) iXeZaOoa (Ex. xxxii 14). With regard to the occurrences in the Pentateuch, where the words chosen are, negatively (3), and positively (6), (7), (8), (11), (12), it has been shown by CHARLES E. FRITSCH 2) that the Greek expressions are an attempt to palliate the anthro- pomorphism. It might be added that in Ex. xxxii 14, the text of B- xao. LX6'aOy x upLoS tepLClotaao t To Xao6v -is probably a deliberate and further weakening of the anthropopathism, as against the literal rendering of A and F, xac i LX&amp;ao KupLoS Trepi T- xcaxa&lt; ? I7CtTrev T7oLrota: for FRITSCH has noted definite evi- dence that the text of B is more anti-anthropomorphic than that of A.3) Outside the Pentateuch, in Jeremiah aiVaTraX6aOL and rtauseOaL (significantly "corrected" by Bb to TrapaxaXeZOait) at least seem to be anti-anthropopathetic, and also ieiZv in Ezek. xxiv 14, unless it represents n3ll as a genuine alternative tradition to Qn39. Yet as against these pEravoeZv is used four times, and rapaZaX?crOatl possibly once (v.1. in Ezek. xxiv 14) out of a total of eight statements (including the one pentateuchal passage, Num. xxiii 19) of God's not repenting of His purpose, and peTavoeZv nine times, and rapaxaXezs'OaO five, out of a total of twenty-five positive references (again including the five in the Pentateuch, where, as FRITSCH has shown, the impropriety is sensed and other expressions are chosen.) Yet even in the Pentateuch in Deut. xxxii 36, we find OnnIT =- 7apaxX706zTal positively of God; FRITSCH observes 4) that anthropomorphisms consistently avoided in the 1) I. L.

Similarly in Jeremiah, alongside 7ro.6ae0a (xxvi 3, 13, 19), 0avaocat6s0Oact (xlii 10), and CavLvoa (xv 6), apparently attempting to palliate the anthropomorphism, we find txJsavozZv negatively (xx 16). The meanings of all the septuagintal renderings listed above are straightforward except for ocapaxaoaZo0alt, which requires some ex- planation. In classical Greek this verb means, in the active, to call in, sendfor, summon, of men, and to invoke a god; passively, it is found in the latter sense already in Thucydides 1). By extension, the passive might reasonably be understood to mean to be (successfully) invoked, and hence chosen as a rendering for 13ll Niph'al and Hithpa'el meaning to repent of a purpose when applied to God. This develop- ment might have taken place quite independently of the fact that the active trapoacxocXev was also adopted by the LXX as a rendering of CMl Pi'el meaning to comfort. This meaning for trapaxaXeZiv, although not found in Greek before the LXX, is a perfectly reason- able extension of its usage, authenticated from Aeschylus onwards, in the sense of to exhort, encourage: but the fact that these two exten- sions were feasible from the same stem in active and passive respecti- vely, probably encouraged its choice as an equivalent for Wnl in its twofold sense of repent of a purpose and comfort. But this same passive, Tcapao0xaoce0cat, was used also to render the passive of nrl to comfort where man is concerned, e.g. Ps. cxix 52; and the meaning be comforted seems to have contaminated the passive x7rxpxaXoa60ct used of God in the sense of be [successfully] in- voked [so as to change His purpose]. Probably this explains why it is retained by the LXX in Deut. xxxii 36 for rlnin, although studiously avoided elsewhere in the Pentateuch, for FRITSCH 2) regards it there as a "less objectionable" rendering than Le-ravooszt. It seems, indeed, probable, that the meaning be comforted ousted that of be [successfully] invoked, in common usage, of 7crpaxaXsZc0ocx; and that this accounts for its frequent use outside the Pentateuch, as consti- tuting a "less objectionable" rendering for Wn1 of God than z-aocvosZv, "repent" would be-although the latter is also used. It will be observed, however, that the softening of the anthropo- pathism is more apparent than real, inasmuch as the Deity can scarcely ) , 118, 8fin. 2) Op. cit. p. 18 n. 2. 265</page><page sequence="6">RAPHAEL LOEWE be conceived to be in need of, or subject to, consolation any more than to change of purpose. Indeed, in the three passages where the literal sense of the original text states as tnuch, the Greek goes to considerable lengths to palliate the anthropopathism. Thus in Is. i 24 "ISt crUX becomes o' t7c xUaCFe-0C yap [Lou 6 0uv64q ev Toti 57rVIVTEOLs (cf. Targum, which treats 13K as a Picel- =17 "M= ... 1 U'W T'f17 X3X).

In Ezek. v 13 "Mtrh311 is tendentiously omitted in the text of B (cf. above p. 264, n. 3); Q (= Theodotion) renders napaxkrO-qiao[xLM (Targum TON, make an end). The minor Greek versions are preserved very fully in the passages here under review. Aquila, who uses 7mpmmXceZGOmXL of man being comforted and (Ps. lxxvii 3) nap-yopeZaOou. in the same sense, most frequently uses 7cmpmmXceZaOXL also of God's repenting of Hispurpose, positively or negatively; yeaOacr is found negatively (1 Sam. xv 29) and positively (Gen. vi 6). In Ezek. xAdv 14 FIELD suggested that he used &amp;etLGP'PeeLV, but of this more in a moment. Symmachus uses 7rmpmmXaeZaOXL and L6?Aea L both positi- vely and negatively, also ~twravoeZv negatively; positively, he uses once each &amp;,toatprcperv (Gen. vi 6) and &amp;vc.atp6kpeLv (Jer. xviii 10)-both, apparently, anti-anthropopathetic solecisms, so that perhaps eiLaTpepyeLv in Ezek. xxiv 14 (negative) should be assigned to Symmachus rather than to Aquila. He also uses [4eCa7L- OeaOcL (a good classical usage) in Jer. xviii 8. Theodotion, for whom there is less evidence, uses 7cmpmxmXeZOea0L negatively (1 Sam. xv 29) and positively (ib. xv 11), and tLeaOc L (2 Sam. iv 6). In addition to these translations there is recorded by Procopius, as a reading of the enigmatic "to Eppoxcx6v" '), &amp;Levo'OYe or 7tpoaeaXev in Gen. vi 6 in place of that version's stock renderings with ttvra[tLeX'0B or 7CMpeyx 0Om. 2) Again, apparently, a pallia- tive rendering. The Greek evidence may thus be summarised as follows. The stock renderings in the LXX of t3nf of God = repent are [4eravoeZv (negative and positive) and 7paxokoeZaO0xL (positive).

Aquila uses most frequently rapaxcaXeCZaOa (negatively and positively), and sometimes tercx0C,- XeaOcmL. The same is true of Symmachus, who, however, has a few alternative solecisms apparently intended anti-anthropopathically; and 7ocapaxaoX0iaOocL (negative and positive) and teroateXecrOact (positive) are also authenticated from Theodotion. Thus, Symmachus emerges as troubled by an occasional anti-anthropopathetic scruple about this Hebrew root that does not seem to have worried Aquila; and this tallies with the results obtained by FRITSCH 1) for the anthro- pomorphisms of the Pentateuch, where Aquila evinces but five anti- anthropomorphic renderings out of thirty-one, as against ten out of thirty-two in Symmachus. Jerome's treatment, as will appear from the analysis below, is a little more rigorous than any of these versions, although he does not press his scruple to the lengths to which the Targum goes. A differentiation seems to emerge between positive and negative statements involving rn1 of God. Where the biblical text states that God does not, or did not, "change His mind", Jerome sees nothing wrong in using an expression involving poenitet 2)-his usual word where man is concerned-although he sometimes rejects it. Where the statement about God is positive, Jerome seems at pains to avoid poenitet-except that, when the statement though positive refers to the past, he seems to feel compelled to retain it (e.g. Gen. vi 6 and 7).

Yet the caution uttered at the beginning of this note against too facile a postulation of "influence" in either direction should be born in mind. The whole anti-anthropomorphic tendency has been regarded by some as an essentially internal Jewish develop- ment of thought, while others have been equally emphatic in tracing it to the influence of Alexandrian philosophy 1). Too rigid a cate- gorisation is unhelpful, and (at least as yet) impossible. We may conclude with a brief glance at the treatment of the same theme in the Syriac Bible and by Sacadiah in Arabic. In the Peshitta we find a surprisingly large number of words to render Qn3, which root is itself out of court as a rendering since it means to resurrectin Syriac; it is, in fact, retained once, in Job xlii 6, introduced probably precisely for this reason. In the three passages where God is said to be comforted, the Peshitta renders literally with '.Ca= in Is. lvii, 6 and Ezek. v 13, but in Is. i, 24 it substitutes .is- s (take vengeance). Where God's change of purpose is mentioned, some of the changes... Some of the changes introduced are surprisingly bold (see the underlined examples in the following list). Negatively, we find vro&amp;w&lt;(Num. xxiii 19, take council), r .i.&amp;, (consider), (regret), =. (lie, Ps. cx 4), v9cor (reverse, m'oAiar Zech. viii 14, where the negative is tendentiously omitted), &gt;uAi (love, have mercy, Ezek. xxiv 14). Positively, there occur ac.&amp;&amp;'r (regret), rac&amp;mr (regret), vs,car&lt; (reverse), rxLLe (be easy, neglectful-Jer. xxvi 3, xlii 10), a r&amp;&amp;cr (rest from, = TrcuecOca Jer. xxvi 13 and 19) rc'&amp;i vur .=A rare . (He rebuked the Angel of Death-a notable alteration-2 Sam. xxiv 16), _.=&amp;r' (was comforted) -aL. (heard, sc. cry, Judges ii 18), &gt;"si (love, have mercy on, Joel ii 14), &lt; .iAnr' (consider, Ex. xxxii 12). In Ps. xc 13, the verse division is ignored, the Peshitta rendering (how long art Thou not comforting Thy servants?) Such manipulations may lead us on Sa'adiah, perhaps the most circumspect of all trans- lators where anthropomorphism is concerned. For the last quoted 1) FRITSCH (op. cit. p. 3 ff) refers to DXHNE (Religions-Philosophie II pp. 1-72) and GF6RERS (Kritische Geschichte II, pp. 1-18) in the latter sense, and Z. FRANKEL (Vorstudien Zu der Septuaginta pp. 125 if, and Einfluss der Paldstinensichen Exegese auf die Alexandrinische Hermeneutik, p. 30) and J. FRENDENTHAL in the Jewish Quarterly Review (Old Series) II pp. 205-22 in the former. 271</page><page sequence="12">272 LOEWE, JEROME'S TREATMENT OF AN ANTHROPOPATHISI passage he has 1) cy= -fUf s, turn away from, i.e. pardon. This is the same expression as he uses in Deut. xxxii 36 2).

"Dieu les menafa au sujet de ce qu'il les avait crees sur la terre.. .en disant: J'ef- facerai... .puisque je les a menaces au sujet de ce que je les avais crees" (or, "lorsqueje les ai crees") 6).
