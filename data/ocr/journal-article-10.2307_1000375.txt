<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSIE CRYSTAL Public Schools, Los Angeles, California Role-Playing in a Troubled Class In the spring semester of 1967 I transferred from an upper-middle- class public school in west Los Ange- les to teach Negro children in a school in central Los Angeles. This community has changed much in the past four to five years. Most of the stable families have moved farther west into "better" sections and have been replaced by more transient fam- ilies. Many of the recent newcomers are families without fathers. More than half of the children in my class had no father living at home. The unem- ployment rate seemed to be well over 50 per cent. The responses of this class on the Federal Impact Survey for May, 1967, indicated that nearly 70 per cent of the parents were un- employed. The per cent may be inac- curate, since the form is unclear, and it is possible that some parents did not fill out the place of employment be- cause of misunderstanding. Most of the homes in the commu- nity are individual dwellings, small, modest, frame houses moderately well kept. This description gives an im- pression of better conditions than really exist. Several families may live in a single dwelling. Relatives who have just come from the South often spend weeks and months with cousins, aunts, or grandmothers. There are pockets of poverty on the fringes bordered by Western Av- enue, the main street. This is an area of ramshackle apartments, shacks be- hind other houses, and the kind of slum conditions associated with back- alley life. My first impression of my class was its explosiveness. Typically, between the time the children came into the class at nine and recess at ten-thirty as many as three fights broke out in the classroom. On the playground the children rarely played with one an- other. They usually fought for the balls and then ran away with them. Unruly behavior is a way of life among highly disturbed children. During the semester there was not a child in this class who was not in- volved in a physical fight. Usually boys fought boys and girls fought girls, but sometimes fights broke out between boys and girls. The outbreaks were usually over name-calling: "He called my mother a dirty name. He was messin' with 169</page><page sequence="2">170 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL January 1969 me." These, of course, were only ex- ternal causes. Repeated failure, con- stant frustration, unsuitable home conditions, inadequate diet, lack of sleep, and inability to talk out prob- lems took their toll. The children's self-concept and sense of worth were weak and negative. School-a drag School re-enforced some of their worst inadequacies. These sixth-grad- ers saw school as a prison, a place to avoid if possible, a trap of all their weaknesses. On the street, some of the children, especially the boys, had already earned status, but at school it was taken away. Among eleven- and twelve-year-olds, it was very "uncool" to be positive about anything having to do with school, even if one did find something attrac- tive about it. The better the show of antagonism toward school, teacher, and lessons, the tougher one appeared and the higher one's status in the peer group. The children's interest was ex- tremely difficult to capture. As a group they were never able to remain calm for more than five minutes at a time. Any kind of instruction had to be given in as short a time as pos- sible. Ideally, teaching should have been done individually or in small groups. There was a negligible amount of group cohesiveness. On a sociogram made during the second week of the semester, no child received more than three choices. Some leadership devel- oped, but it was effective only occa- sionally. Group discussions and evaluations were almost impossible, since the chil- dren reacted with barrages of accusa- tions and counteraccusations; tempers flared immediately and a brand new fight broke out. Riot-like conditions were not uncommon. One fight led to others in and out of the classroom. During individual talks with chil- dren involved in some difficulty, there was rarely any sign of objectivity or of understanding the dynamics of the incident. Reasoning it out with a child did not seem to work. The confront- ed child always seemed to feel unjust- ly accused, persecuted, resentful, and blameless. It seemed impossible to help a child see the other guy's side, regardless of guilt. It seemed that the child always felt that he had been the sole recipient of injury so that no un- derstanding could be reached and there were often recurrences the next day. At this point it seemed reasonable to try role-playing. Role-playing provides experience in seeing the relationship between cause and effect. Since wise choices depend on foreseeing probable conse- quences, role-playing would hope- fully lead to the habit of using forethought and break the existing behavior pattern of impulsive physi- cal outbursts. A preference for action Muriel Crosby (1), Hilda Taba (2), and Frank Riessman (3), all spe- cialists in the study of disadvantaged children, have reported that children from low income families respond more fully and directly to action than</page><page sequence="3">ROLE-PLAYING 171 to talk. Role-playing offers many op- portunities. The informality, the hu- mor, and the empathy-arousing drama catch young people's interest, involve them, and hold their attention. Slum children, whose crowded homes and play settings condition them to work- ing together, find the group aspects of role-playing natural. In contrast to their lack of attentiveness in ordinary discussion and their hesitancy to an- swer questions, they respond to role- playing more spontaneously and en- thusiastically. Pantomime Since my pupils were reluctant to approach any activity that appeared unfamiliar or different, I thought it best to start the role-playing sequence with short, quick, warm-up exercises in which simple situations could be enacted in pantomime. I tried sugges- tions that Mark Chesler and Robert Fox made in their book (4) Role- Playing Methods in the Classroom: walking on pebbles barefooted looking for a lost puppy arguing with a silent umpire eating potato chips, a lemon, pickles, cotton candy throwing an ice cube, a feather, a hot potato, a ball having a cinder in one's eye carrying a heavy water bucket lifting a heavy load putting on a pull-over sweater stand facing another student pretending to be his reflection in a mirror walking a tightrope The authors list pantomimes that re- quire some show of emotion, though no words: How do you feel when: it rains on the day of a picnic. a large dog is running toward you. you find a dead bird. your baseball bat is broken. you see people teasing a dog. you are watching a funny film. you get an A or an F on a test. you see a friend who has been telling lies about you. The authors also list problem situ- ations for one main character: two good friends ask you to go to two different places at the same time. your best friend tries to talk to you while you're listening to an explanation of a lesson in math. a friend tries to get you to sneak off the playground at noon. you see two kids who are about to get into a fight. you're walking by a fruit stand and your friend tries to get you to steal. you're in the middle of a good game and some outsider runs away with the ball. you're sitting doing your spelling work and the person sitting across from you starts shooting paper clips. a neighbor tries to look at your answers during a test. I began the pantomimes about the fourth week of school. The whole class was enthusiastic. It was the first time the class responded unanimously to anything I suggested. There were many volunteers, and I had my first opportunity to see the children in a fairly natural situation. They had been extremely guarded about any spontaneous expression outside of anger or hostility. We had not laughed together once before this first pan- tomime session. Unrecognized talent emerged. Chil- dren who posed the worst behavior</page><page sequence="4">172 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL January 1969 problems were the most enthusiastic participants and among the most gifted actors. Through the dramatizations, it became evident that many of the children were very observant of their physical environment, very much aware of weight, distance, pain, balance, temperature, and taste. They were not at all lacking in the involve- ment that seemed characteristic of their ordinary classroom behavior. For the first time I saw them laugh at themselves. For the first time I saw them show delight, amusement, and the kind of child-like joy that is easily found among middle-class children in ordinary situations. For the first half-hour session, the children actually enjoyed one another in an unhostile, friendly, and accept- ing way. It seemed as if they were discovering things about one another they had never recognized. They would clap spontaneously at some- one's good performance and look to where I was sitting as if to say, "Wasn't that great?" Encore The children who showed the most remarkable response were the two most hostile and most belligerent boys in the room. It seemed as if all the at- tention they had been lacking was suddenly available to them, and they clamored for more "pantomine" long after it was over. The sessions gave me the first gen- uine opportunity to praise the two boys for something they felt great about doing. Previously, I had given praise honestly, but I sensed their re- jection of it almost every time, since praise from Teacher was usually con- sidered "uncool." After recess-no change I must add that my big disappoint- ment came when after the first few pantomimes several children lost in- terest because they were not person- ally involved. I had asked some of them to take the roles, but they re- fused. After the first ten or fifteen minutes they showed signs of restless- ness, but did not disturb those who were still acting. During that first ses- sion none of the children who pre- sented serious behavior problems lost interest. It was also disappointing that after recess the children showed no change in general behavior even though they had left the classroom with high esprit de corps. I realize now that any change would have been miraculous. We had many long sessions before any sign of improvement appeared. What misled me in my expectations was that in every other teaching situation, any such activity-whether dramatic play, construction, or art-yielded almost immediate results in building group cohesiveness. But not here in central Los Angeles. After this initial pantomime session, I used every opportunity that lent it- self to dramatization. In our social studies we were studying Nigeria. Any information that we read that could be acted out was dramatized on the spot. I found that this made the children eager to read more in order to be able to "pantomine." We pan- tomimed every aspect of our study, from tapping rubber trees to boiling</page><page sequence="5">ROLE-PLAYING 173 palm oil. Perhaps the greatest value of role-playing was that it gave the chil- dren a legitimate opportunity to get out of their seats. At the time I was reading them African folk tales from various sources written especially for chil- dren. The stories are excellent for dramatization, since they stress action rather than conversation. Further- more, they are often about inanimate objects that come to life or animals that have anthropomorphic qualities. The stories can be used almost exact- ly as they are without any modifica- tion. They are short and follow a simple line of action in much the same way that Aesop's Fables do. The tales are ideal to build groundwork for more complicated role-playing. Many children who refused to take the role of a person accepted the role of an animal. A plea for plays After several weeks, role-playing or dramatization became a part of the curriculum. Certain children often said to me: "What we were doing can be acted out. Could we please?" We played one folk tale for the principal and any visitor that hap- pened to come to the class. This was an activity the children definitely "felt" in the experiential sense. Still, the intense behavior problems continued. The fighting did not les- sen. Peer hostility did not taper off. Perhaps the most positive outcome so far was that the children seemed to enjoy school more than before. Dur- ing this period several of my worst offenders in the schoolyard and in the classroom were threatened with trans- fer to other classes. They met the threat with begging and pleading for another chance. I decided to perceive this as a positive outcome, though I was not ready to establish any con- nection between dramatization and the desire to remain in class. A problem story During the tenth week of school I introduced the first problem story, "But Names Will Never Hurt Me," from the book Role-Playing for Social Values (5) by Fannie R. Schaftel. Though I had warned the children that there would be no ending, they were quite agitated that it was so. Many wanted to act out the story, but refused when they were called on. I suspect that they refused because of the ambiguity and the fear of making a mistake or of being unable to make up the proper ending. We discussed possible solutions, which I listed on the board under two headings, "positive" and "negative." We laboriously acted out each solu- tion, and I was gratified and encour- aged to hear the children say: "Well, couldn't you talk it over before you started to fight?" "Hey, come on don't fight; it ain't gonna help." "Let's go call the teacher." "Callin' names ain't nothin' so bad." There was also the usual, "I'm gon- na get my brother, punk, don't mess with me." There was one mock fight, which the actors ended themselves. When we took a final vote, the children decided on one of the nega-</page><page sequence="6">174 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL January 1969 tive solutions, much to my disappoint- ment. I was perplexed at the time by the public sanctioning the vote seemed to give to fighting, but de- cided to keep trying. I realized that it was easy for me to contaminate any kind of genuine ex- pression if I too openly showed ap- proval or disapproval at the time of the evaluation. It was entirely pos- sible that they might be voting just to thwart the teacher's expectations, since they were so hostile toward any authority figures. pupils become playwrights After recess I had a pleasant sur- prise. They asked me whether they might act out a play they had made up on the playground just before. Re- luctantly I allowed it-but after arith- metic. I was determined to do some teaching that day, and they were quite stimulated from the excitement of the morning. One difficulty of allowing "acting out" is that children tend to become perhaps even "higher" immediately after it is over. The teacher must de- cide whether she can stand the stress that accompanies such behavior. I tried to have a recess period immedi- ately after the sessions. It was always difficult to judge when to stop and when to continue. One has to sense whether the class is becoming so "high" that the rest of the morning will be impossible. Whenever I could, I chose not to threaten the children with total elimination of the activity, since it would have defeated my ul- timate purposes. The play that the children worked out by themselves was quite simple and unrefined in presentation, as I had expected. Loosely put together, though full of spontaneity and en- thusiasm, it was about two children who had been in a fight and were now being represented by older brothers and sisters. There was a great deal of fast and loud arguing. A mock fight broke out, but it was quickly ended by some of the more peaceful adver- saries and a firm matriarchal figure, who finally said, "Well, if you ain't gonna apologize, then just go home." This ended the play. The negative tone of the earlier play that morning was now replaced by a much more positive manner. I was encouraged. The rest of the day classroom be- havior seemed more acceptable, prob- ably because of my own optimism over the second play. The two natural leaders in the class had enjoyed the venture. They were much more co- operative than usual in helping to get the class in order for dismissal. These same two leaders were the loudest, most stubborn, and often most unruly members of the class. They could swing in either direction. Dramatiza- tion brought out their better qualities more consistently than any other classroom activity. Problems in the audience About half of the pupils in the class were still non-participants, how- ever. When the plays dragged, these children showed a great deal of bore- dom and became so disturbing that they interfered with the play acting. The biggest problem was still how to involve everyone.</page><page sequence="7">ROLE-PLAYING 175 At the following session, the chil- dren again acted out a play written by the children themselves. Several girls were spending their free time writing plays with long elaborate lists of characters, little dialogue, and sketchy descriptions of the action. Since few of the children would be able to "read" scripts even if they were more adequately prepared, I de- cided at this point not to interfere with the playwriting. On social life A large group of children formed to enact one of these plays and begged for time to practice. The play they wanted to do was about a camp situ- ation in which the boys and the girls came together and were expected to socialize. Since this was a pre-ado- lescent group, it seemed a natural theme. Meetings and introductions were elaborately enacted. An amaz- ing degree of personality was re- vealed. Each boy or girl introduced himself and then interacted in a "so- cial teen-age" atmosphere. I found the play useful for understanding some of the children's self-concepts. Some revealed a brand new side I had never suspected. Again, leadership was clearly shown. I was beginning to recognize increasingly why certain children held power over their peers. I saw that the children who were decisive and fast-talking were the most popu- lar. Quick action, regardless of its appropriateness in a given situation, was the quality that was most admired and respected. Georgene and Stewart, the two emergent leaders, had a great deal of "style" and were unquestionably con- sidered "hip." Both were extremely aggressive and often brutal in their treatment of their peers. I am fairly sure that neither child was well liked, but both were feared and given the kind of respect that accompanies fear. It is not surprising that the chil- dren attached themselves to such au- thoritarian types. This is the kind of personality that has probably had the most influence in their own personal lives. Standard ending The play ended in the usual "fight" between the boys, much to the girls' disdain. The playwright protested vociferously that she had not written the script that way, but no one was paying attention to the script any- more. I was not overly distressed by the "violent" end, for a great deal of co- operation and accommodation had gone into the rehearsals. I had steered clear of giving any direction. I ac- cepted the invitation to watch the final rehearsal on the playground, but made no recommendations. I wanted to see how the children acted toward one another when they had a com- mon goal about which there was a fair amount of commitment. It was gratifying to see that they seemed to interact with more cohesiveness, self- direction, and harmony than I had ever seen in them before. The next play the children pre- sented was "Johnny Kotowski," from the book by Schaftel (5). Somehow the story did not reach them. No one</page><page sequence="8">176 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL January 1969 wanted to accept a part immediately. Reluctance and lack of interest were obvious. The performance was artifi- cial and muddled. Shift to the casual I decided to go back to simpler story plots in which the action was confined to a single scene. It was hard for the children to change scenes without a great deal of direction from me; my interruptions tended to stifle spontaneity. Also, I tried a more casual approach to the sessions. Often in the middle of the day when I sensed that the children were so restless that little constructive activity would be pos- sible, I would say, "I need two people at the front of the room to do a play. You're going to act out a situation in which your best friend tries to talk you into leaving the playground at lunch time. Who wants to try it?" The response to such spontaneous skits was enthusiastic. The results were becoming more natural and more delightful. The whole class be- came far more involved when the plays were short and quick than when they were long. Often we would end with a good laugh at something funny that had happened and then resume curriculum activities. I sensed that the children-actors and audience- tended to forget themselves and be- come deeply immersed in the action. I asked Georgene and Stewart to do the disciplining during these short skits. Since both were keen on acting, they ruled with an iron hand and order was easily maintained. I felt that this was useful, for peer-group con- trol was developing. It allowed me to become part of the audience, free to observe and show approval without having to act as part-time referee. The skits that dealt with stealing and other illegal behavior showed a lack of concern with morality; the only concern was fear of being caught. The ramifications were ob- vious. I had discussed the rightness or wrongness of an aggressive act with the children, but I now realized that this approach was inappropriate. At this point all that should be empha- sized was the realistic danger inherent in an aggressive act, not the morality of it. This was no small discovery. A welcome guest At this time the principal asked to observe some sessions. The children and I welcomed the opportunity to have her as a guest. The children were pleased because her visit gave them an important personage in the audience. I was glad because I knew that her presence would make some deeper evaluation possible. Fewer children would openly attack each other as in previous evaluations. The attempts at evaluation had all too fre- quently turned into vicious accusa- tions that created brand new conflicts. It must be said that this principal is an exceptionally sensitive, perceptive, and sympathetic person, who encour- ages any innovation that may have even the remotest chance of reaching children.</page><page sequence="9">ROLE-PLAYING 177 The spelling test For the occasion two children en- acted a skit about cheating during a spelling test. The skit was extremely well acted by the two culprits as well as the girl who played the role of teacher. When she discovered the cheating, she silently pulled one child away from his friend and went right on with the spelling test without ut- tering a single syllable of reproach. We were able to have a discussion on cheating-how it feels to have someone copy answers from your paper, how the teacher feels about it. The class said that it was not really that bad to miss many words. All that happens is that you have to take the test again after you have had a chance to study the words once more. The children were unanimous in their ap- proval of the "teacher's" method of handling the cheater. They were glad that she did not embarrass him. Hav- ing to cheat was embarrassment enough. This was certainly the most suc- cessful session so far. Watching the children at their most "mature" level gave the teacher and the children re- newed hope. Because this class set a high premium on negative behavior, this experience with maturity was a revelation. In the afternoon of that same day, we had class elections, which were held about every two weeks to give many pupils a chance to hold office. The children voted out the incumbent officers, Georgene and Stewart, and chose a quiet but powerful boy who said little, but could fight anyone on the schoolyard. The former leaders were miffed and threatened to be dis- ruptive under any new officer. Sub- sequently, they refused co-operation on every occasion, but the class and I did our best to ignore them. Un- fortunately, the next day, the new president got into a heated battle with a girl during arithmetic and had to be suspended from school. The suspen- sion gave the former leaders fuel for their fires. I was uncertain whether to reinstate him or to rule him out, as several pupils suggested. The problem promised to be a good topic for the next role-playing session. The following day the children were hostile. Fearing an excess of punitive reaction, I did not bring up the question of keeping the new presi- dent, Brian, in office. Toward give-and-take We played a scene in which two smaller children were being bullied by the classroom tormentor and an- other child tried to intervene. Three sets of children played the scene. After the plays were over, I asked the class to vote on which was the best solution. Then I asked them to vote on the best solutions as they thought their own mother might vote, as they thought the principal might vote, and as they thought their best friend might vote. To my surprise, they agreed unanimously on the most positive solution. It was-in each elec- tion-the solution that offered a com- promise.</page><page sequence="10">178 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL January 1969 A break from old patterns? Each of the three scenes showed a definite increase in verbal rather than physical efforts to solve problems. At the risk of excess optimism, I hoped that the children were beginning to realize that there is a way besides physical reaction. I doubted that any of the role-playing would influence their daily interactions, for when emotions run high, reason runs low. Still, the fact that the children were beginning to even think of other solu- tions in their calmer moments might be a sign that the role-playing was having an effect. I chose to hope it was a beginning. The Schaftel story "Trick or Treat" created eager participation (5). In the story a mild prank results in a serious injury for which two inno- cent children are blamed. The chil- dren enacted the scene in which one boy attempts to persuade the other culprit to own up. Interesting argu- ments were offered: "You ain't gonna be able to sleep if you don't." "Your conscience is really gonna hurt your head." "You gonna go straight to the devil." "Man, if you don't tell, you got no soul." As usual, the children who are in trouble almost daily are the ones who talk most freely along these lines. Yet on the day this play was presented I was distressed to see a knock-down, drag-out battle between the two boys who had made the most contributions in the discussion after the play. Evi- dently, any kind of transference would require far more play acting. The trick-or-treat tale ended with the consultation of a juvenile officer, who took the pair of boys down to be fingerprinted. This turn of events led to a heated argument over what happens at juvenile hall. I explained briefly the appearance before a judge and punishment depending on the seriousness of the offense. One boy then asked whether the culprits in our story would receive a milder sen- tence if they agreed to pay for the damages. The whole class was excited by this suggestion, but some realists reminded their classmates that money cannot really compensate for physi- cal injury. Growth I believe that I saw growth in the application of reasoning to problems when they were isolated in this way, but the lack of visible carry-over is discouraging and makes me wonder whether role-playing is worth the time and energy. Dare I take heart from the belief that though the chil- dren may not always come up with proper behavior, they continue to give the problems thought when they are alone or perhaps in a more com- fortable atmosphere? That hope, it would seem, justified continuing this daily exercise. "Keeping the faith" is not easy! In "Shutter-Bug," from the Schaf- tel book, an individual has to make a decision as to whether to consider his desires or the needs of the group (5). The outcome was not especially</page><page sequence="11">ROLE-PLAYING 179 meaningful. As I watched the presen- tation, I was wondering whether the story was appropriate when I over- heard a small buzz group discussing the problem privately. "This," they were telling one another, "was just like the time when. ...." Guidelines for tomorrow At that moment I had a flash of in- sight that these experiences in the classroom may have far more value sometime in the future when the chil- dren will recall them, perhaps even as guidelines for their own plan of ac- tion. Right now because of emotional immaturity, the children may not yet be able to apply some of the solutions offered. Later they may well recall a similar situation and how their peers reacted. Maybe it is this process of laying bare the reactions of their peers that will ultimately be most meaningful. The recognition that everyone has similar experiences and has to meet conflicts that are more alike than different may give the chil- dren a measure of security they might not otherwise have. The experience of watching and participating in these make-believe situations that are real and life-like gives the viewer a storehouse of ex- periences in human relationships he would not otherwise have. When children are removed from the emo- tionally charged context in which conflicts usually occur, they are like- ly to come to an intellectual under- standing of what is going on. Whether their immediate subsequent behavior is affected is perhaps not so important -however desirable from my point of view-as the opportunity to observe and evaluate in an unthreatening en- vironment. The fact that the children verbalize their conclusions poorly does not mean that they lack under- standing. I am making no final judgments on the basis of this semester's activities. I am far more certain of the potential value this process holds for "typical" classes than for the one I taught. I am also aware of my limited knowledge and experience in guiding these ses- sions. In the hands of a trained guid- ance counselor or psychologist, role- playing is probably far more likely to be effective. I cannot even be sure that the ordinary classroom teacher ought to tamper with this sensitive area. Few principals would have per- mitted it, I am sure. I am grateful for the opportunity to try it and will continue my efforts. The time to reach disadvantaged children is now. Role-playing offers some hope. REFERENCES 1. Muriel Crosby.
