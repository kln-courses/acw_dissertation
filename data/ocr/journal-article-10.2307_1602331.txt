<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Enhancement Imperative: The Evolutionary Neurophysiology of Durkheimian Solidarity* MICHAEL HAMMOND Department of Sociology, University of Toronto Durkheimian solidarity, especially in regard to religion, is reanalyzed in terms of recent developments in the neurosciences and evolution. Neurophysiological studies indicate that religious arousers can piggyback on reward circuitry established by natural selection for interpersonal attachments. This piggybacking is rooted in uneven evolutionary changes in cognitive capacities, emotional arousal capabilities, and pre- conscious screening rules for rewarding arousal release. Uneven development means that only a special class of enhanced arousers embedded in macro social structures can tap some of the reservoirs of expanded arousal release protected by these screening rules. It becomes imperative that part of collective social life offers these special arouser packages. Beginning with religion and inequality, the social construction of enhanced arousers leaves a trail across human history. However, this trail is not quite what Durkheim had in mind. INTRODUCTION The technological advances and theoretical changes in the neurosciences and evolution cast new light on many aspects of the sociological tradition. This article looks at Durkheimian solidarity. Durkheim believed that humans must link strong interpersonal attachments with another set of emotionally strong bonds to larger social structures. To be emotionally attractive, these structures must be marked by a high degree of differ- entiation, such as the contrast between the sacred and the profane. Without a second set of attachments to such high-contrast structures, humans are incomplete and are far more likely to experience psychological anxiety and anomie. For Durkheim, the study of this second set of ties lay at the heart of the new field of sociology. Durkheim also claimed that these high-differentiation structures marked out a path through human history. Religion was the first and most historically common example of this extended solidarity. Later, other forms of emotionally loaded differentiation, such as the social division of labor, would appear to provide solidarity under different historical condi- tions (Durkheim [1893] 1964; Hammond 1983; Lukes 1973:24-25, 138-40). Unfortunately, Durkheim never attempted to specify just why humans were wired to be so attracted to highly differentiated social creations. In his obsession with the idea that society has its own unique objective reality, he was content to state his law of gravitation in the social world ([1893] 1964:339) without investigating the nature of his gravity. Similarly, he rejected the idea of an innate religious sentiment regularly fueling the emergence of religion ([1895] 1964:107), but he did not try to specify the reward circuitry that might lie at the basis of contrasts such as the sacred and the *I am most grateful to the editor and anonymous reviewers of Sociological Theory for their many helpful suggestions on this article.

He also made no effort to probe into the deeper dynamics of collective rituals that were a part of his concept of "effervescence," in which religious beliefs and sentiments were transformed into social solidarity. With his commitment to social phenomena having a sui generis reality, he was not to look into the black box of the human mind that generated such creations. Today, however, we can begin to pry open this box a little. Parts of Durkheim's model can now be tentatively grounded in both evolutionary theory and neuroscience data. Other parts are not supported, but point in the direction of new possibilities for sociological theory. For example, in much the same manner as Durkheim saw ties to individuals and social structures as woven together, the new revolutionary technol- ogies to study the brain demonstrate that strong personal attachments and religious experiences use many of the same neurophysiological components for rewarding emotional release. In order for them not to get in each other's way, there must be a means to regulate the use of these common components. The manner in which this regulation occurs gives the neurophysiological groundwork for some of Durkheim's claims about solidarity. From this perspective, humans have an imperative to seek out macro social constructions offering additional attractive arousal release. Only high- contrast structures can tap these reservoirs. Religion is, in part, a product of that imperative. To understand these dynamics, it is necessary to review recent research on religion in the neurosciences and to examine the role of uneven neurophysiological changes in the evolutionary origin of humanity. THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF PIGGYBACKING Although incomplete at present, neuroscience research indicates that religious experi- ences do not have their own specific subsystems of arousal rewards. Instead, religion seems to piggyback upon processes established before the origin of our species and expanded in our evolutionary formation. The subcortical areas of specialized sub- systems and neurotransmitters for various kinds of attachments are not all known in great detail (Fisher, Aron, and Brown 2002; Le Doux 2002:233). Like other subsys- tems of reward circuitry, however, they are beginning to be unveiled (Bartels and Zeki 2000; Farrow et al. 2001; Knutson 2002; Smith and Stevens 1999, 2002). Hormones from the hypothalamus, such as vasopressin and oxytocin, have been demonstrated to be crucial to some aspects of partner loyalty and parenting behavior in attachment (Carter 1998; Fisher, Aron, and Brown 2002; Konner 2002:325-26). Studies of some religious experiences have also shown increases in hormones such as vasopressin (MacLean, Walton, and Wenneberg 1994). Similarly, heightened activity in areas of the temporal lobe such as the hypothalamus and the amygdala, as well as in other areas such as the anterior cingulate, has been shown to be stimulated by arousers involving strong personal bonds and by arousers involving religious activities (Joseph 1996; Newberg, d'Aquili, and Rause 2001:4, 42-45; Saver and Rabin 1997). The piggybacking hypothesis also provides a framework in which to interpret other recent discoveries in the neuroscience of religious experiences while awaiting a parallel study in regard to attachment experiences. For instance, Andrew Newberg and his colleagues have used single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan- ning to demonstrate that some religious stimuli have a dampening impact on the posterior superior parietal area, associated with maintaining a physical sense of the self as a separate object in the world (Newberg, d'Aquili, and Rause 2001). Dampening activity in this orientation area is associated with feeling close to spiritual beings or 360</page><page sequence="3">THE ENHANCEMENT IMPERATIVE feeling connected to another level of reality. At first glance, it might appear likely that this dampening of the sense of self in the world would have a disorienting impact on individuals. If this dampening had been useful elsewhere in our evolutionary history in regard to other arousers, however, then the ability to piggyback on these other experi- ences could be felt positively. What other interest might find such a dampening to be attractive? The most likely candidate is an attachment interest in which the temporary dampening of the self as a separate object in the world could be used to stimulate and reinforce a strong personal tie between individuals. If religious arousers could tap into this same pattern, then this dampening would be interpreted positively in terms of very appealing contact with other beings or other worlds of experience. Once again, in producing this second set of attachments, religious stimuli seem to be able to piggyback on arousal reward pathways already established for other ties. Without its own reward circuitry, religious arousers could make use of the variety of subsystems for personal ties. As Melvin Konner (2002:323-33) indicates, parent-child, sibling and other kin, male-female, and nonsexual friendship bonds appear to have some elements specific to a tie and other elements shared in common. With piggyback- ing, each could provide a pathway to arousal rewards. Similarly, there is growing evidence that romantic attraction has some of its own subsystems in regard to hor- mones, neurotransmitters, and other subcortical elements (Bartels and Zeki 2000; Fisher, Aron, and Brown 2002), and it could be that religious arousers are able to double up here also. Indeed, with such stacking, religion might be able to use a number of reward pathways linked to a number of different interests. For instance, Rhawn Joseph (1996:287) notes that sexual arousal has its own reward circuitry and that some religious experiences have demonstrated characteristics indicating a sexual component. From the point of view of the economy of natural selection, if there are selective advantages to individuals engaging in a collective construction such as religion, then there is a real benefit to a piggybacking relationship. The alternative of evolving a fully separate subsystem for religion entails a great many more changes. Given the difficulties of integrating any new developments into an already complicated struc- ture, evolution normally takes the path of lesser change for any selective advantage. As Alexandra Maryanski and Jonathan Turner stress, evolution prefers extensions, elaborations, and alterations of a biological heritage rather than dramatic mutations (Maryanski and Turner 1992:57). This is part of the "principle of conservation of organization" (Stebbins 1969:103-04, 125). Metaphorically speaking, evolution's con- cern is with getting the most benefits for the least number of changes. In the case being considered here, by letting two sets of ties use the same neurophysiological com- ponents, individuals would have a selective advantage that accomplishes this task in a most elegant and parsimonious manner. However, piggybacking does create a potential problem. Unless it is regulated in some manner, it is entirely possible that interpersonal attachments and religion could quite literally get in the way of one another. Given the finite capacity of any reward system, an increase in the use of the common components for personal bonds could entail a decrease in possible use for religious ties, and vice versa. Empirically, this does not appear to be the case. Individuals with strong religious beliefs do not have, on the average, fewer or less intense personal ties than individuals without such beliefs, and nonbelievers do not have, on the average, a greater number of or more intense personal ties than believers (see, e.g., Fischer 1982:208-14). Thus, if there is a selective advantage to piggybacking, there must be some means evolved to regulate this dual use. What is the evolutionary logic in this piggybacking arrangement? There are two issues to be considered. First, there is the question of ultimate causation. What are the 361</page><page sequence="4">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY selective advantages in using this doubling-up system? What would individuals gain with group creations such as religion piggybacking arousal rewards? Second, there is the question of proximate causation. What are the means used to create such an arrangement and to limit the possible difficulties in such a dual-use system? Let us look at one of the advantages in terms of increased social-network size among individuals and some of the mechanisms that might be used to extend network size. Maryanski and Turner (1992) argue persuasively that for a number of reasons, the scale of reliable social ties had to be increased for humans in comparison to the pattern of our closest evolutionary relatives and to the presumed pattern of our last common ancestor. Increased solidarity was facilitated both by the major expansion of our cognitive capabilities in areas such as language and communication and by the lesser but still significant expansion of our affective capacities. Turner (2000:92) has demonstrated this in summarizing the comparative evidence for the relative size of brain components in great apes (i.e., the gorilla, the chimpanzee, and the orangutan), humans, and a primitive mammal. The neocortex had the greatest increase in relative size. However, there were also substantial enlargements of subcortical areas such as the diencephalon, the amygdala, the septum, and the hippocampus. These enlarged areas are all possible sources of additional affective capacities. With more capacities, humans could have more strong affiliations. These ties could have a great deal of reliability, based, in part, on the rewarding arousal release in such linkages. Many other valuable social resources could flow along the lines rooted in these affective dynamics, and the two lines of exchange could reinforce one another. In order to maintain a high degree of flexibility-a characteristic demonstrated in much of human evolution-the selective advantage was not in favor of a hard-wired fixing of the direction or number of these ties. Affective loading was ideal for this role. It increased reliability, with a minimum sacrifice in flexibility. There are two paths that could have had a selective advantage in the pursuit of more emotionally rewarding ties. The first was to make parallel and balanced changes in the expansion of affective capacities and in the preconscious rules for converting additional stimuli into rewarding arousal. Even changes would mean more of the same-in this case, more direct personal ties on a one-to-one basis. The greater the resources available, the greater would be the number of personal ties. This extension of personal ties occurred to some extent, but equally important was a second strategy to expand social-network size. The second path was to make uneven changes in relation to arousal-release capacities and arouser-screening rules. Uneven develop- ment would create an indirect means to produce a much larger number of reliable ties than was possible with direct personal bonds. As we shall see below, in our evolu- tionary context of origin, religion was one such indirect vehicle. Before examining the logic in favor of uneven changes, however, it is necessary to outline the basic pre- conscious rules for the conversion of arouser additions into rewarding arousal release. AROUSER SCREENING The human brain has a wide range of stimulus-appraisal mechanisms, with an equally wide range of conscious and unconscious triggers shaping responses (Le Doux 1996). One set of these mechanisms is made up of arouser-screening rules preconsciously shaping responses to stimuli based upon more or less recent responses to other arousers (Hammond 1999, 2001). The basic conversion question in these screening rules is, how much arousal release in exchange for how much stimuli strength? 362</page><page sequence="5">THE ENHANCEMENT IMPERATIVE Habituation is probably the most familiar rule. Faced with the repetition of a novel attractive arouser, arousal release begins to decrease. The same arouser produces less rewarding arousal. Habituation thereby creates an arousal reservoir ready for use if another novel attractive arouser appears. Although there are a number of factors that can affect the rate of habituation, there is ultimately a significant preconscious element in such a discounting of arouser impact. Even though we are members of a species with awesome cognitive capacities, we do not have the means to be directly aware of these arouser screens, and we cannot consciously prevent this arousal- dampening. The preconscious screening rules that are the most important sociologically are those that control the release of additional rewarding arousal in the face of a variety of additional arousers. For instance, at some point it takes stronger and stronger arouser contrast values to trigger the same arousal release produced before with lesser contrasts. At some further point, even the strongest of arouser additions only pro- duces a diminished arousal release. At some endpoint, no arouser additions will produce anything much in the way of rewarding arousal, and such additions may produce negative arousal. These conversion codes are at the root of diminishing marginal utility measured in terms of arousal rewards. If natural selection favors only a limited variety of stimuli, then the preconscious discounting of the arousal impact of additional stimuli is severe and irreversible. If there is a selective advantage to more extended variety, then the discounting is eased in the face of certain types of arouser packages (Hammond 1999). Changes in arouser screening can be a part of wider evolutionary changes. Take the example of a species in which, under one set of circumstances, natural selection has favored a strategy for males involving the pursuit of the largest number of different female partners possible. Novelty of additional arousers is given precedence in arouser screening, and familiarity leads to a rapid decline of sexual interest. One of the consequences of this strategy is to limit the amount of male-male long-term cooperation and the amount of male-female cooperation. Such stable ties are very difficult with this male sexual strategy. What if circumstances change and there is selective pressure favoring more male-male or male-female cooperation? Sexual interest must remain strong, but the screening for additional sexual arousers will have to be altered to discourage the pursuit of too much novel variety. Increase the rate of dampening for novel additions, and sexual interest can remain high while focusing on a smaller number of potential partners. At the opposite extreme from the novelty-maximization strategy, the screening codes can be set to favor only one mate at a time, with a rapid discounting of any additional sexual interest. Or the schedule can be set somewhere in between these two extremes, with some sexual interest in additional females, but also a diminishing return curve as the number of additions increases. Different circumstances can produce different outcomes. By changing the preconscious screening protocols, natural selection can change the pattern of activity in the pursuit of any interest. In terms of natural selection, one advantage of arouser screening is the controlled flexibility made possible by adjusting the different points at which screening rules kick in. They can be set to not have a significant impact on the first arousers appealing to an interest or some combination of interests. Individuals will then pay almost any cost for even the most basic stimuli. Calculations of effort, time, and risk are often minimal if the alternative is no such arousers available at all. However, beyond that point, screen- ing comes more and more into play. Its role is to ensure that interest is extended only under better and better conditions in terms of arouser strength and access costs. As more and more arousers become available, there occurs a point sooner or later when 363</page><page sequence="6">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY only more and more stimuli differentiation without a parallel increase in costs will trigger sufficient arousal release to fuel expanded interest. In other words, only Durkheimian-like high-contrast differentiation can tap additional arousal reservoirs, and this only occurs if the price is right. If those costs are high, and the screening codes are limiting rewarding arousal release, then the ratio of attractive arousal to unattrac- tive costs will not be inviting. This decreases the appeal of any further extension of interest and increases the appeal of other activities pursuing other interests. The special arouser packages with additional attractive contrasts not paralleled by equal cost increases are called "enhancements" (Hammond 2001, 2002). The dispro- portionality in their ratio of arouser contrasts to access costs can counter the effects of arousal dampening in the screening rules. In a wide variety of circumstances, if enhanced arousers are available, interest is extended. If they are not, arousal release is eroded, and before too long, individuals turn to other activities. Different settings of the arouser-screening codes determine when only enhancements will extend interest. These special packages can be required early on with arouser additions, or they can come into play later on. The disproportionality requirement in the ratio of arouser contrasts to access costs can have both an absolute and a relative quality. There can be an initial absolute baseline for the extension of interest. Without some disproportionality, interest will simply not go much beyond such a point. Most important sociologically are circum- stances offering more and more disproportionate additions. These additions can extend interest again and again. The impact of such additions is relative to the strength of the previous disproportionate packages. The rule here is that the greater the number of enhancements piled on one another, the greater must be the ratio of increases in appealing arouser contrasts to changes in access costs. Otherwise, reward- ing arousal release will simply not be there. Hammond (1999) discusses some of the general aspects of neuromodulation that are part of arouser screening. Universal patterns in electrochemical transmission of neural messages create one basis for such variable arousal release. For instance, by altering the active zones at the terminal ends of the cell, neurotransmitter commu- nication between cells can be altered. This makes it possible for experiences to modify the properties of synapses (Carlson 1995). These changes can be stored as a kind of memory that, in turn, alters the response to future stimuli (see also Bear and Linden 2001). Natural selection can operate on these mechanisms of electro- chemical transmission to direct interest toward and away from different sets of arousers. Similarly, hormone and neurotransmitter release can be tied to the degree of differentiation in stimuli available. Neuroscientists have looked at arouser screening in other primates by wiring up specific neurons associated with interests such as feeding. One of the classic studies of these rules in action was done with rhesus monkeys by E. T. Rolls and his colleagues (1986). In this experiment, the monkeys were presented with four attractive and familiar foods, one after another. Arousal impact was measured in terms of neural firing rates. The first three were similar in their appealing contrasts and in their initial arousal impact. The fourth had greater contrast values, but was available with no extra effort. It was an enhanced arouser because it offered more appealing contrasts with no parallel increase in access costs. After consuming a great deal of the first arouser, interest fell off completely in more of that substance, but not in eating itself. Screening rules simply required that further interest be fueled by different stimuli. The presentation of the second and third arouser had a lessened impact, but still enough to extend interest somewhat. The fourth had had a much greater initial impact, and after 364</page><page sequence="7">THE ENHANCEMENT IMPERATIVE a great deal of consumption, only the presentation of the fourth produced an arousal spike back up to the original level of the first three. That is, only the enhanced arouser contrasts of the fourth produced enough interest to continue eating after the pre- sentation of the first three stimuli. Altogether, the interest in eating was extended by arouser variety, but not proportionately to the variety of stimuli presented. Having four attractive arousers did not quadruple interest, but the package did extend interest greatly. We do not permit the wiring-up of specific neurons in the human brain as we do in other primates, but it is clear that the same pattern exists in humans. As B. J. Rolls and colleagues (1981) have demonstrated in humans, increase the variety of attractive foods available and interest will be extended-but not proportionately to the increase in food variety. There is no plausible reason to assume that other interests involving a variety of possible arousers in rhesus monkeys or in humans are wired any way other than is the case for the interest-in-food variety. Arouser screening for greater contrast values is the common pattern. Details may vary in the screening schedule, such as in terms of the starting points for arouser depreciation or the later points at which only enhanced arousers will continue interest. These variations do not alter the basic pattern, however. How important are enhancements to be? How many members of a population are they meant to touch? The answer depends on the selective pressures in the evolu- tionary origin of a species. In many nonhuman species, enhanced arouser packages may only appear occasionally, such as in the case of exceptional food-provisioning opportunities. Their role is comparatively minor. It is good to take advantage of them when they occur, but it is also possible to live without them. They are only options. In the human case, enhancements are an imperative on a regular basis for the entire population. So much potentially attractive arousal is protected by arouser screening that humans will always seek out at least one-or preferably more than one-of these special packages. To understand this imperative, it is necessary to look at the evolu- tionary logic in preferring uneven rather than balanced changes in arousal capacities and screening rules. EVEN OR UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT? As noted above, there were two basic alternatives with selective advantages in regard to using expanded affective capacities to frame extended tie networks. The first was to have balanced changes between expanding arousal capacities and delaying increased contrast requirements in arouser screening for the release of that arousal. This would reduce the arousal-dampening impact for ties to additional human beings, who can have only a limited contrast value in terms of differences from other, already emo- tionally moving humans. With a less demanding screening schedule, there would be sufficient contrasts among other available individuals to provide more rewarding arousal and extend network size. Even development did extend networks to some extent, but it was supplemented with a second strategy based on uneven changes and enhanced arousers. Direct ties between individuals can have high flexibility and reliability, but they require sig- nificant investments of time and emotional energy on a case-by-case basis. At some point, there was a selective advantage to using an indirect approach that could produce an even greater number of reliable ties without as much in the way of further increases in affective arousal capacities and further changes in screening 365</page><page sequence="8">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY rules. Indirect ties between individuals through a common, emotionally laden third point, such as a social structure, can produce a greater number of reliable ties with a lesser increase in affective capacities and a smaller change in the conversion schedule. The triangulation to a common attachment is an ideal bridge between individuals. It can link a greater number of individuals with fewer total costs than a direct tie-by-tie construction. This is only possible, however, if the bridge is an enhanced structure offering the special package of increased arouser contrast values without a parallel increase in access costs. That is, the larger structure must offer an arouser package that further additions to direct personal bonds cannot equal. Otherwise, individuals will stick with personal ties. From the point of view of natural selection, how to best produce this extension of interest? Take an attachment interest, and lag evolutionary changes in arouser screen- ing for increased contrast values behind the expansion of affective capacities. For the addition of more strong personal bonds, this uneven development will produce early dampening in relation to the significant reservoirs of attractive arousal release remain- ing available for attachments. That is, such early screening will dampen interest in additional direct personal ties even though the affective resources remain for more such bonds. The attachment interest will have to turn to enhanced structures able to access these arousal reservoirs through very special arousers available at much the same costs as regular direct ties. Once again, there are two basic paths that might have selective advantages in regard to this uneven development and its emphasis on enhanced arousers. First, there could be precise, hard-wired detailing of the enhanced structures providing the common point of reference for a large network of individuals. Second, there could be little or no detailing. In the first case, evolution could create preconscious triggers and reward pathways specific to these enhanced structures, thereby guaranteeing their appearance. However, there were problems with such detailing in the human case. It would go against the general trend to increase flexibility in the behavioral repertoire of humans. It would also require more neurophysiological changes than the alter- native of not specifying the enhancements for network extension. Evolving major new reward pathways and appraisal mechanisms specifically for the extended interest would clearly be more problematical than simply piggybacking on existent compon- ents. The easiest solution would be the second alternative: mix uneven changes in arousal capacities and arouser-screening rules along with little or no precise detailing for the enhancement imperative created by this combination. All of this was made possible by the last aspect of uneven development, the massive expansion of human cognitive capabilities. There were many other selective factors favoring this expansion, but one factor was its role in creating enhanced arousers. Any enhancement requires disproportionality in arouser contrasts and access costs. Hard- wired detailing can provide both. If such scaffolding was not to be used in the human case, however, there must be other developments that could make a contribution to meeting this disproportionality demand. Our cognitive skills can offer such a possi- bility. They can handle vastly increased amounts of information to create and main- tain very special enhanced arouser packages. Hard-wired detailing represents a type of knowledge based upon the past experience of individuals expressed in terms of reproductive success. Without such specifications, it is crucial that there exist sophis- ticated tools to substitute another form of knowledge framing action for any interest. The greater the cognitive capacities, the less additional detailing is required. The less the detailing, the greater is the behavioral flexibility, for enhanced arousers or for any other human pursuit. 366</page><page sequence="9">THE ENHANCEMENT IMPERATIVE RELIGION AND THE ENHANCEMENT IMPERATIVE As noted earlier, Durkheim made no attempt to look into the black box of the human brain to trace the beginnings of an interest in gods and spirits as part of the sacred. In his definitive intellectual biography of Durkheim, Steven Lukes argues that Durkheim was an early and long-time admirer of French intellectuals, such as Fustel de Coulanges, who asserted that gods are nothing else than the beliefs of individuals (Lukes 1973:62). However, Durkheim also argued that these beliefs were not totally illusory ([1912] 1976:262, 417). They were only partly illusory. What was real was the society itself from which these beliefs emerged. For Durkheim, the world of gods and spirits was "only society transfigured and conceived symbolically" ([1924] 1953:52). This transfiguration meant that humans were able to attach themselves to a special macro structure with many attractive characteristics that direct personal ties to other individuals could not offer. It was no wonder, therefore, that for Durkheim, humans were irresistibly attracted to such social attachments. This position was part of Durkheim's fixation on the idea that society has a sui generis objective reality of its own, a stance that few support today. How might Durkheim's position be reanalyzed in terms of the enhancement impera- tive? This alternative model suggests that the symbolic conceptions of gods and spirits do offer a set of attachments with qualities that purely personal ties to other human beings cannot offer. Humans have the expanded cognitive capacities for these symbolic renderings at a reasonable cost. We have the arousal reservoirs to fuel these additional attachments. There are also real selective advantages to such additions. One of those advantages is that a religious species can have reliable social networks far larger than those our evolutionary cousins have. Such religiously framed networks would be partly illusory in Durkheim's terms, but they would also be very real. For natural selection, there are two steps to predisposing humans to increase their network size through a construction such as religion. The first step is to have early arouser screening for an attachment interest. This quickly launches individuals on a quest for enhanced arousers that can tap the deep arousal reservoirs remaining. In our evolutionary context of origin, with dispersed and often nomadic populations having only limited technologies, what kind of special beings could offer increased arouser contrast values without a similar increase in access costs? These beings must be enough like regular human beings to be able to tap into already-established reward pathways, but they must also have enough appealing extraordinary characteristics to counter the effects of screening rules for arouser additions using those pathways. Is this not a good description of the sacred beings that emerge in all these cultures? These creations have enough anthropomorphic qualities to open the gates of arouser screening, and enough extrahuman characteristics to push through that barrier. Let them have control of different parts of the natural world. Let them shape the path of illness and death, or recovery and rebirth. In any specific set of historical circumstances, let them do things that ordinary humans can only dream of in that situation. The result is that high- contrast additions become available for much the same costs as more direct personal ties. In the face of such Durkheimian high-contrast differentiation, the arousal release will feel totally real. Ties to these enhanced beings will be experienced as just as real as bonds to other human beings. The evidence of this parallel experience is in the neurophysiological studies of piggybacking referred to above. This piggybacking highlights the importance of anthropomorphism in providing a bridge to additional arousal release. Having spirit beings with some human characteris- tics is more than a useful cognitive tool in aiding individuals to grasp the nature of the 367</page><page sequence="10">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY sacred. It is also a vehicle for easing access to reward systems that predate our emergence as a species. The animism and ancestor worship so common to hunter-gatherer religions are the first examples of this pattern. As Durkheim noted, in terms of representing the physical world, these religions are "scarcely more than a fabric of errors," but their appeal lies elsewhere ([1912] 1976:225). The degree of anthropomorphism can vary, both on an individual and collective level, but it will always be an element of any religious belief within a population as a whole. The second step in predisposing humans to creations such as religion is to set the early arouser screening for very high-contrast values that only a larger social group can provide on a regular basis. If the requirement is for elevated differentiation, it is going to be very difficult for individuals, families, or close kin to create and maintain such very special arouser packages by themselves on a regular basis over the long term. The costs in terms of time and effort would simply be too great in the face of arouser screening that demands increased contrast values without a parallel increase in those costs. For example, the larger group can afford to support specialists devoting extra time and effort to these creations, thereby taking some of the load off many other individuals. Similarly, the larger group can have collective rituals with a comparative impact that more micro units cannot regularly match except at a greater individual cost. Evolve the right set of arouser-screening rules, and by the standards of our closest evolutionary cousins, only a large number of individuals can regularly create those special arousers without having any individual or small group of people pay too great a cost. The result is a species that must seek out a wide breadth of ties and that can use an enhancement package such as religion to frame those ties. Durkheim's emphasis on the role of totemic systems in early religion is a good example of the social-bridge alternative to tie-by-tie networks. A shared totem links many different individuals within a group. Totem differentiation between groups organizes even larger numbers. The social-breadth requirement also increases the penalties for cheating on resource exchange among individuals who share a package of these sacred beings. The cheater then risks the potential punishment from the sacred world, and also risks having the number of ties to other humans drop below the expanded size necessary to maintain the sacred world without too great a burden on the individual. With a body ready to trigger attractive arousal release from reservoirs protected by early arouser screening, the rewards for such symbolic transfigurations are immediate and powerful, especially in a ritual social context involving other individuals experi- encing the same dynamics. In such circumstances, our bodies will leap at these opportunities, especially if they are the only enhancements regularly available. Thus, the Durkheimian "effervescence" of religious ritual can be rooted in uneven neuro- physiological changes and the enhancement imperative these developments create. The result is that in many circumstances, the most moving response to this imperative for many individuals has been the social construction of religion. The enhancement model also supports Durkheim's claim that in worshipping a religion, individuals are in fact worshipping their own social world, but are unaware of this ([1912] 1976:209, 225). Once again, from his perspective on the existence of a sui generis social reality, Durkheim has no inclination to ask what deeper elements might be at the roots of such a dynamic. The preconscious arousal release from enhanced arousers creates this dynamic. It might feel as if the sacred is the origin of these arousal rewards, but in fact, those rewards are a product of preconscious screening rules of which we have no means to be directly aware. Thus, even though social constructions such as religion are a product of individuals, they will feel as if they have another origin, and believers will be predisposed to act as if the sacred does in fact originate elsewhere. 368</page><page sequence="11">THE ENHANCEMENT IMPERATIVE Using an enhancement strategy, the selective advantage would nudge individuals toward these types of constructions without using hard-wired details specifically designed for religion. There is no need for anything like what popularly might be called a "religion gene." Just lag the arouser-screening schedule such that humans cannot find special enhanced arousers through efforts among their closest personal ties. Individuals must then find a way to make a linkage to a greater number of individuals, who of course are caught up in the same quest for extended attachments. In a vast range of social conditions, one product of this common quest is the social structure we label "religion." It should be noted that an enhanced structure such as religion helps humanity cope with some of the problems created by the massive increase in our cognitive capacities. A very smart species is going to have concerns that others will not. As Robert Hinde (1999) has demonstrated, problems such as understanding otherwise inexplicable events, sensing a degree of control over one's life, and giving life meaning emerge with all our new capacities. Simultaneously, religion emerges as one response to such dilemmas. Such an enhancement can both extend social cooperation and reduce psychological anxiety. This article has tried to suggest one proximate mechanism of attachment piggybacking for this emergence. There are bound to be other mechanisms rooted in other interests that religion might serve, but these, too, should soon be coming into the light as neuroscientists sharpen their skills and technologies. Finally, the enhancement-imperative model provides one factor to help to account for what might appear to many social theorists to be the astounding perseverance of the belief in spiritual beings of one kind or another in contemporary high-technology cultures in which the forces of secularization should be at their apex. Given our evolutionary origins and neurophysiological developments, the arousal-release rewards for a belief in spiritual forces are not simply going to disappear. It is much more likely that such enhancements will continue to be very appealing to a wide range of individuals. In the face of a wide variety of alternative enhanced secular arouser packages in modern high-technology cultures, the comparative emphasis on religious enhancements might erode somewhat, but the appeal of these spirits is not going to evaporate completely. BACK TO DURKHEIMIAN SOLIDARITY Let us review Durkheimian solidarity in light of this enhancement model. Durkheim made three basic claims. First, humans have a need not just for strong direct personal attachments, but also for bonds to emotionally moving, macro social structures. Without these additional ties, humans suffer from anomie or psycho- logical anxiety. Therefore, for Durkheim, it is crucial to find social structures offer- ing this solidarity. The enhancement model suggests a mechanism that creates an imperative to find enhanced ties and that facilitates the piggybacking of ties. The natural-selection logic behind enhancement supports Durkheim's first claim. Second, Durkheim argued that only high-contrast differentiation could frame these additional ties. Anything less does not seem to have the emotional impact necessary. The enhancement model makes it clear why such high contrasts are necessary for individuals carrying early arouser-screening rules guarding deep arousal reservoirs. Once again, Durkheim's claim is supported. Third, Durkheim asserted that in pre- industrial societies, religion, with its sacred-profane differentiation, was the most historically common social construction for these dynamics. The enhancement model 369</page><page sequence="12">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY highlights the natural-selection logic that made the emergence of the sacred so universal in our first historical context. Altogether, the enhancement-imperative model suggests that in certain respects, Durkheim was right. We are wired to seek more than close personal ties. We must also seek at least one set of enhanced arousers. To overcome the dampening effect of the arouser addition conversion schedule, these enhancements must be marked by high- contrast differentiation. These enhancements are regularly available only in more macro social constructions. A web of close personal ties, however moving it might be, will not be able to tap additional rewarding arousal release protected by early screening for enhanced arousers. The most likely enhancement to appear in our early history was religion. No other social structure could regularly offer so many high- contrast arousers to so many individuals at such reasonable costs. However, the enhancement model also highlights the limitations of Durkheim's perspective on solidarity. Humans might always seek out linkages to social structures much larger than the network of personal ties they can sustain, but this extended solidarity does not necessarily translate into the functional unity Durkheim so desper- ately sought. It is clear that Durkheim was conflating solidarity and unity by making the assumption that network-extending attachments only work effectively if they are tied into a fully integrated social system. All members of a group might be required to sustain a structure such as religion in our evolutionary context of origin, but this is not necessarily the case after our exodus from that small-scale world. The difficulties in Durkheim's position are evident in his strained attempt, using the concept of organic solidarity, to argue that the social division of labor in larger-scale societies can play the same solidarity- and unity-inducing role that religion can play at a smaller scale. The division of labor does provide heightened differentiation, but at a massive cost, with some benefiting much more than others. It is no wonder that Durkheim could never specify just how such inflated inequality was going to reintro- duce both solidarity and functional integration to modern social life. Similarly, other enhanced arouser packages such as racism, ethnicity, and nation- alism that hyperinflate differences among individuals might be good vehicles for solidarity extension, but with very different consequences than Durkheim would have wished. Like religion, such packages provide high-contrast arousers with anthro- pomorphic qualities, making it easier to tap into our basic attachment interests. Like religion, the additional arousal release triggered by such enhancements can be very appealing. But the other consequences of these enhancements hardly fit into the functionalist model. The same is true for social inequality in general. ENHANCEMENTS AND INEQUALITY Like the differentiation between the sacred and the profane, the pursuit of status differentiation can also be shaped by arouser-screening rules that piggyback different behavioral responses on top of one another. Attachments come in two packages, one enhanced and one not. Social inequality also comes in proportionate and dispropor- tionate packages (Hammond 1999). Proportionate inequality provides status contrasts that parallel the costs expended to acquire such differentiation. Disproportionate inequality provides status contrasts that do not require parallel cost expenditures. In our earliest history, there were some circumstances favoring the inequality of propor- tionate packages, and other circumstances favoring disproportionality. Once again, just as in the case of attachment and religion, with uneven changes in cognitive capacities, 370</page><page sequence="13">THE ENHANCEMENT IMPERATIVE affective release reservoirs, and arouser-screening rules, humans could readily produce both basic patterns, as well as different mixes of those patterns. They could also move comparatively easily between these alternatives. This gave our species unparalleled flexibility while pushing individuals toward lesser or greater degrees of inequality depending upon specific circumstances. As with extended attachments, scientists are just beginning to peek into the black box of the neurophysiology of inequality to try to trace the mechanisms that make such packages possible. Research has already focused on the neurotransmitter sero- tonin (see, e.g., Sanderson 2001:292-93). Higher serotonin levels seem to have a positive impact on a wide variety of behavior, and that is one reason why serotonin- elevating drugs such as Prozac can be used to counter depression. Studies have linked serotonin rates to social status in both males and females (Westergaard et al. 1999). There is some evidence that serotonin also serves as a conduit to other activation systems by regulating the frequency and intensity of arousal release elsewhere (Higley et al. 1996). In any case, natural selection can operate at the level of such substances with regard to shaping an interest such as status differentiation. It is possible to set a hypothetical arousal-release schedule for neurotransmitters and hormones (Hammond 2002) such that in certain situations there is a dampened interest in expanded inequality, as well as active resistance to such inequality. In other situations, the same preconscious arouser-screening rules can heighten interest in inflated inequality and dampen resistance to such an extension. The fine-tuning of the screening rules has to be somewhat different than in the attachment case, but the extension of interest is very similar. In many conditions, only disproportionate arouser packages will be able to trigger additional arousal release on a regular basis. Once again, two or even more behavior patterns can be produced from the same reward system without too much interference and without hard-wired detailing of outcomes. In our evolutionary context of origin, this piggybacking had many selective advantages for individuals. With our exodus from that early history, however, the outcomes tilted more and more to favor the expansion of inequality to extremes that had little to do with the origins of this piggybacking. Take the example of ascriptive male and female gender-solidarity groups in hunting and gathering societies (Hammond forthcoming). Like religion, such macro social constructions have significant indirect advantages in extending gender networks for cooperation and resource exchange far beyond that of our evolutionary relatives. Like religion, these creations add social ties at a lesser cost per tie than that incurred using more direct personal attachments. These gender groupings are particularly important in partially reducing the male-male competition seen in our closest evolutionary relatives, as well as in expanding the scope of female-female cooperation. Both were necessary steps to a hunting-and-gathering division of labor, allowing humans to occupy successfully a whole new range of ecological niches. From the point of view of natural selection, what is the most efficient means to push individuals toward these gender-solidarity groups? Just as in the case of religion, this is a two-step process. First, use early arouser screening, but in this case, focus on a status- differentiation interest. The result is that individuals will soon be looking to add some enhanced arousers offering further attractive status contrasts without a parallel increase in access costs. For a number of reasons, the only enhancements widely available in such contexts are ascriptive gender-status markers. Ascription is appealing in the face of early arouser screening because it imputes performance differences, but does not necessarily demand that all individuals actually demonstrate their superiority on any specific valued quality. Simultaneously, ascription discourages or prevents others from 371</page><page sequence="14">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY trying to show that they, too, have certain qualities meriting that status. Limiting merit competition can provide a tremendous cost savings for those protected by ascriptive walls. Thus, with ascription, the variety of status arousers available to an individual can increase, without a necessary parallel increase in the costs of claiming those status markers. As with religion and attachment, the second step is to set arouser screening for a status-differentiation interest such that at least some of the disproportionality demanded to trigger additional rewarding arousal release is too great for individuals, families, or close kin to maintain over the long term. In the face of this arouser screening, only the larger collective group, such as all males or all females, can provide some of the cost-efficient enhanced-status arousers. Individuals will then quickly be pushed to seek out extended ties within such macro groups in order to access these special arouser packages, and many other resources can flow along the lines estab- lished by these ties. Once again, there is no need for what might popularly be called an "ascription gene" to account for this emergent behavior. What we label "ascription" is simply the least costly enhancement in many circumstances. If individuals are pursu- ing enhancements, most will go for ascription first. The potential inflation of ascrip- tive differentiation and the disproportionate escalation of merit inequality were capped by the small scale of our evolutionary context of origin. With our exodus, these enhancements rapidly expanded in size and shape, often with many tragic consequences (Hammond 1999). It is important to note, however, that the same model of early arouser screening and enhancements can help to explain the regular emergence of another striking behavior pattern in humans. In his Division of Labor in Society ([1893] 1964), Durkheim did try to turn economic differentiation and inequality into a new form of solidarity in presenting a social evolutionary sequence to organic solidarity in modern industrial cultures. But it is clear that Durkheim was stretching things here. As plausible as his analysis of the functional origin of religion might be, his perspective on the parallel macro integra- tion effects of the social division of labor is implausible. The extended social ties that might be created by economic differentiation are real enough, but it does not follow that these translate into macro social unification. Indeed, an enhanced status interest rooted in such extended networks can lead to the fevered pursuit of goals having just the opposite impact on many members of a population. It could be that Durkheim was right in arguing that differentiation structures such as the sacred and the profane or social stratification are tied together-but not because of their common function in promoting solidarity. Instead, they are tied together in terms of their reliance on a common pattern of uneven neurophysiological development fueling a quest for enhanced arouser packages. Despite these problems with Durkheim's perspective on solidarity in more complex societies, his basic insight that these dynamics leave a trail across our history was partially correct. Durkheim clearly saw that high-contrast differentiation was an imperative for human beings. Its arousal release was somehow crucial to the social life of the new species. Solidarity-inducing enhancements such as religion were one product of this imperative. Collective ascriptive inequality was another product fuel- ing expanded social networks. After the historical exodus from our evolutionary context of origin, both enhancements flourished. But-especially in the case of inflated inequality-they also produced many developments that compromised the Durkheimian dream of macro solidarity in larger societies. Eventually, a third enhancement package appeared with high-technology production and consumption on a mass scale (Hammond 1999:356). These technological enhancements make high- contrast and low-cost arouser packages available for virtually all interests, even as 372</page><page sequence="15">THE ENHANCEMENT IMPERATIVE classic enhancements such as religion and inflated inequality continue to be attractive. The competition among these three enhancement packages gives our modern cultures their special imprint. CONCLUSION At the very beginning of modern sociology, Durkheim suggested that there was a key linkage between high-contrast differentiation and solidarity that produced a social evolutionary sequence in human history. When one follows the trail of enhanced contrasts rooted in uneven neurophysiological changes, a sequence does appear, even though the focus is not always on solidarity. This is not quite the path Durkheim had in mind, but it shows how sociological tradition and modern neurosciences can be fused into a new synthesis. REFERENCES Bartels, A., and S. Zeki. 2000.
