<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jewish Scholarship in the United States: Selections from the Literature, 1967-1969 T״ JLhe number of books on Judaism and the Jews, published in the last few years in the United States, was probably larger than in any com parable period. Books dealing with every possible manifestation of Jewish life, some trivial, some significant; works examining the role of Judaism in civilization or grappling with the challenges of the recent past and the complexities of modern society; novels having Jewish heroes often filled with self-contempt, abound on the shelves of today's American bookstores and in book review sections of newspapers and periodicals—indeed proof of the vitality of contemporary American Jewry. A relatively smaller part of this flood of books was devoted to the thorough scholarly investigation of the Jewish past. The present survey deals with the last segment, and includes a selection from the recently published works of American authors, as well as works of non-Americans published by American publishing houses. A most welcome change was the appearance in reprint, with new introductions, of many long out-of-print classics. Generally, the introduction evaluates the signifi cance of the original work, contains a short outline of scholarly developments since its publication, and points to further research possibilities and tasks ahead in the field. In the main, this aspect of publishing has been under taken by Ktav Publishing House, New York. The survey will include reprints in the appropriate subject area, not in a separate section (AJYB, Vol. 69 [1968], pp. 362-364). It should be noted that the survey is selective, and excludes books on contemporary affairs, sociology, political science, and those not written from a scholarly, academic point of view. Biblical and Ancient Near Eastern Studies are also excluded, in the main. BIBLIOGRAPHY AND BOOKLORE A major tool for research on the American Jewish community's role in the last half century is the American Jewish Year Book: Index to Volumes 1-50 (1899-1949),(1899-1949), compiled by Elf ride C. Solis-Cohen. Listing names of persons, organizations, and subjects, it is a well-arranged, simple guide, most useful in historical, biographical, and communal research. Another index, of the first 25 volumes (1939-1964) of Jewish Social Studies, prepared by Max M. Rothschild, makes this publication's rich and varied contents easily accès sible. Hebrew Union College Annual, one of the most important and oldest American-Jewish scholarly periodicals, now has a cumulative name and 308</page><page sequence="2">JEWISH SCHOLARSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES / 309 subject index edited by Isaiah Berger. The catalogue of the Hebrew collec tion of Harvard University Library was published in six volumes. In his introduction to the catalogue, Charles Berlin discusses the history and significance of this magnificent Judaica and Hebraica library. Containing author, title, and subject entries, the catalogue has already become an indispensable reference tool for librarians and scholars in this country and abroad. The classification of Judaica and Hebraica libraries challenged many great scholars and bibliographers to come forward with their solution to the problem. Harry A. Wolfson of Harvard devised the system in use at Harvard University library, and the above-mentioned catalogue was based on his classification scheme. A new attempt in this field is A Classification System for for Libraries of Judaica by David H. and Daniel J. Elazar. After 16 years of experimenting at the United Hebrew Schools library in Detroit, Mich., the authors presented a system which takes into consideration recent develop ments in Jewish life, and gives much attention to books on Jewish observance and practice, education, and the State of Israel. Michael Yizhar is the author of the useful Bibliography of Hebrew Publications Publications on the Dead Sea Scrolls. In The German Jew in America, Rudolf Glanz provides an annotated list of publications discussing the social, political, literary, and scholarly activities of the German-Jewish immigrant in the United States. Two exhibition catalogues contain beautiful illustrations of and scholarly information on Jewish ceremonial objects, Hebrew manuscripts, and old Hebrew books: Ingathering, edited by Irene Winter, describes the Jewish Museum's "Ceremony and Tradition" exhibition of items from New York City museums and libraries. In Remembrance of Creation by David S. Berkowitz catalogues a major Bible exhibition arranged on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Brandeis University. William Popper's The Censorship of Hebrew Books, reprinted with a new introduction by M. Carmilly-Weinberger, examines the attitude of Church authorities toward the Hebrew book. The long history of banning, burning, and expurgating Jewish books is brought to its sad climax with Carmilly's discussion of the Nazi book burnings in Germany and German-occupied countries. HISTORY: EVENTS, TRENDS, AND PERSONALITIES Professor Salo W. Baron has continued his major work, A Social and Religious Religious History of the Jews, with the publication of two further volumes. As in the previous twelve volumes, and perhaps even more so, the author mastered a tremendous wealth of material in a wide variety of cultures. The result is the usual lucid synthesis of very complex historical processes and</page><page sequence="3">310 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1970 a most detailed, comprehensive section of notes. Leading us to the threshold of the modern age, Baron describes how Jewish history was affected by the Inquisition, humanism, the Renaissance and Reformation. It is impossible to indicate in this survey the many areas Baron illuminates. Briefly, the volumes examine the turbulent general and Jewish history of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, the various shifts in Jewish centers of population, the interactions of different Jewries—reaching back to the medieval origins of the events and trends and delineating the early developments ushering in modern times. Simon Dubnov's older, but still useful, History of the Jews, from the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, is now available in English translation. Jewish Jewish Military Colony Two books present the life of Jewish and Aramean settlers in fifth-century Egypt. Bezalel Porten's Archives from Elephantine vividly describes the political, economic, religious, family, and communal life of the Elephantine Jewish community, using all available sources. Yochanan Muffs, in Studies in in the Aramaic Legal Papyri from Elephantine, discusses highly technical legal aspects of the Elephantine documents against the background of other Ancient Near Eastern texts. Through his thorough analysis, quite a number of passages in biblical and rabbinic literature are explained as fixed formulas of the general Near Eastern legal tradition. Babylonian Babylonian Jewish History During the period under review, Jacob Neusner published two additional volumes of his important A History of the Jews in Babylonia, from 273 C.E. to 379 C.E. Neusner set for himself the task of systematizing the many dis jointed, scattered statements in talmudic literature in order to present a "coherent outline of political, religious and cultural, and social history." He attempted a reconstruction of the historical fabric of Babylonian Jewry against the background of general Iranian history. Avoiding the danger of writing the history of the literature of the Babylonia diaspora, Neusner reconstructed mainly from literary sources, the role of the rabbinate in the community. He deals with the relationship between the elite of the academies and the broad masses; with the cooperation, and sometimes tension, between the secular power of the Exilarchate and the religious authority of the rabbis. The fourth century in Babylonian Jewry was a period of stabilization, with the rabbis being "heirs of giants and progenitors of giants." In that period they succeeded in consolidating their decisive role as legal authorities, religious leaders, and even as men of magic and medicine. Neusner's skillful extraction from the "jigsaw puzzle" of talmudic literature of the underlying social, legal, political, and cultural pattern of Babylonian rabbinic Judaism, gives insight into the origins of many later developments in Jewish history.</page><page sequence="4">JEWISH SCHOLARSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES / 311 Classic Classic of Jewish Historiography The critical edition of Abraham ibn Daud's The Book of Tradition, pre pared by Gerson D. Cohen, contains, in addition to the critical Hebrew text and its English translation, a very learned and interesting interpretation of ibn Daud's ideology as expressed in his chronicle, and an analysis of the spiritual and political atmosphere of the eleventh- and twelfth-century Spanish Jewish community. Cohen first determines the faulty chronology of the work, and then reconstructs with ingenuity its concept of symmetry which construes Jewish history as fixed, alternating periods of doom and redemption. Through this symmetrical presentation, ibn Daud obliquely expresses his expectation of redemption. Cohen established the work's tendency to represent messianic speculations. However, other elements can be distinguished. The author's presentation of an uninterrupted chain of tradition in rabbinic Judaism probably was his way of engaging in anti Karaitic polemics, purporting to prove that the only true tradition is that of the rabbinite community. While the chronicle's value for biblical, talmudic and geonic history is rather limited, it is a most important source for the history of the Jews in Spain, though Cohen points to its many anecdotical elements. Cohen's interpretation reveals to us the noble type of the Spanish statesman-rabbi, who unites within himself Torah, Greek wisdom, poetry, and politic skill. Jews Jews Jews in Many Lands In his earlier works on Franco-German Jewry, Irving A. Agus outlined his thesis concerning the decisive and creative contribution of medieval Ashkenazi Jewry to the development of organized urban life in Europe. His new volume The Heroic Age of Franco-German Jewry, drawing mainly on the Responsa literature, examines the economic and communal life of the Jews in tenth- and eleventh-century Central and Western Europe. Agus paints a picture of a highly distinct and talented community which developed a most intricate and advanced form of social, political, and economic organization in what Agus says was a primitive and barbaric environment. Achieving autonomy, the Jews of that time were able to enjoy a great measure of political, personal, and economic freedom and security. Agus also proposes that the uniqueness of medieval Franco-German Jewry in fluenced the emergence of modern Western Jewry as the most significant branch of the Jewish people. Arthur Hertzberg's The French Enlightenment and the Jews, deals with another crucial period in European Jewish history. The author traces the events and examines the philosophical trends leading to the emancipation of the Jews in Europe. Describing the internal life of French Jewry in the preemancipation period, he points out the group's diversity, as represented by Portuguese, Sephardi, and Alsatian elements. The examination of the</page><page sequence="5">312 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1970 relationship of these groups to Church and state authorities is accompanied by a very detailed analysis of the attitudes of the great French philosophers, notably Voltaire, to the Jewish question. Hertzberg suggests that modern antisemitism, as well as nineteenth- and twentieth-century Jewish visions of total assimilation, were born in these French circles of the eighteenth cen tury. Anticlericalism, assertion of religious freedom, the beginnings of Bible criticism, and the emergence of Western liberalism were responsible for the political emancipation of the Jews, but also for their tendencies toward assimilation as well as for antisemitism directed against those Jews who, for some reason or other, were considered to be outside modern Western European civilization. Here mention should be made of the publication of the first volume of The The Jews of Czechoslovakia, a compendium of historical studies by well known scholars. A survey of the state of Jewish historiography in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia is followed by other papers dealing with the political, economic, and cultural life of the Jews in the lands of modern Czecho Slovakia. A series of lectures by prominent scholars, mainly on past and current problems of German-Jewish relations, was published under the title Studies of of the Leo Baeck Institute, edited by Max Kreutzberger. An important contribution to the early history of the Jews in New York is the publication of the Letters of the Franks Family (1773—1748) by Leo Hershkowitz and Isidore S. Meyer. These letters provide information not only about the life of the Jews in the city, their place in society, and their contacts here and abroad, but also about life in general in eighteenth-century New York. A compact history of a once great, now disappearing, Jewish community is offered by André Chouraqui in Between East and West. The 2,500-year old past of North African Jews is recounted, with special emphasis on the last 150 years. In dealing with the earlier period, Chouraqui describes the diversity of the group which was formed under the rule of empires that underwent many changes. The internal life of the community, its peculiar customs, social conditions, religious beliefs, and political status are reviewed before Chouraqui turns to the discussion of modern developments under the French, and then in independent North African states. The final chapter describes mass emigration to Israel and the problems of integration into Israeli society. The modern history of Egyptian Jewry is the subject of Jacob M. Landau's Jews Jews in Nineteenth-Century Egypt. Though the early history of that Jewry became relatively well known, mainly through the discovery of the Cairo Geniza, its more recent developments received only scant attention. Landau used many original documents for his presentation of the demography, occupations, community organization, and intellectual and religious life of Egyptian Jews from the early part of the nineteenth century to the end of</page><page sequence="6">JEWISH SCHOLARSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES / 313 the First World War. He strongly emphasizes the effect of modernization and the influence of European, especially British, colonial interests on the community. Two works by Isidore Epstein, The "Responsa" of Rabbi Solomon ben AdrethAdreth and The Responsa of Rabbi Simon b. Zemah Duran, were reprinted with an introduction by Solomon B. Freehof. Epstein used these responsa as source material for the social history of Spanish and North African Jewry, respectively. In his short but most interesting introduction, Freehof describes the nature of responsa literature and its significance for social history. He also surveys other works utilizing responsa for historical study, and ap praises Epstein's contribution to the field. Finally, reprints of Joseph Schwarz's Descriptive Geography and Brief Historical Historical Sketch of Palestine and of Joshua Starr's Romania: The Jewries of of the Levant After the Fourth Crusade, are to be welcomed. Great Great Jewish Personalities The revised edition of Don Isaac Abravanel by Benzion Netanyahu is a detailed description of one of the most colorful personalities in Jewish history. Descendant of a noble and wealthy family, statesman, scholar, and philosopher, Abravanel played a most important role at a crucial period of Jewish history: before, during, and after the expulsion of the Jews from the Iberian Peninsula. Though, according to Netanyahu, Abravanel "failed to sense the strength and direction of the tide" before the expulsion, his writings, permeated with deep faith and messianic hope, offered aid and solace to a generation in despair. Abravanel's theology and philosophy reveal him as a man deeply rooted in medieval traditions, who saw the world through a mystical veil; his political career shows him as a practical statesman of great financial and diplomatic skill. The moving and dramatic story of a martyr of the Inquisition is unfolded in the writings of the younger Luis de Carvajal, the Enlightened. A member of a family of forcibly converted Jews of Spanish origin, Carvajal grew up as a Christian, but later returned to Judaism, was tried by the Mexican Inquisition, and condemned to death. Seymour B. Liebman, the editor and translator of Carvajal's letters, memoirs, and last will, prefaces the book with a learned discussion of Carvajal's family background and life, and of the Mexican Inquisition in the sixteenth century. The beautiful English transla tion, presented in a fine typographical form, reveals a most touching record of the heroic life and death of a crypto-Jew who returned to his ancient faith. The reissue of Meier Kayserling's Christopher Columbus and the Partici pationpation of the Jews in the Spanish and Portuguese Discoveries also con tributes to the understanding of the era of the Spanish Inquisition. Other biographical works lead us to the more recent past. Jacob B. Mandelbaum published a most thorough and useful Index to Rabbi Chaim Nathan Dembitzer's Klilath Yofi, which makes Dembitzer's work on the</page><page sequence="7">314 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1970 history of the rabbis of Lemberg and other Polish cities much more accès sible. A famous native of Lemberg who was one of the founders of the scholarly study of Judaism in the nineteenth century is the subject of Isaac Barzilay's biography Shlomo Yehudah Rapoport. Barzilay examines Rapo port's contribution to the establishment of modern Jewish scholarship and describes his relationship with his contemporaries. He discusses Rapoport as defender of traditional Judaism but, at the same time, also of innovative critical spirit, which led to his embroilment in many controversies. A large section of the book is devoted to Rapoport's reasons for devoting himself to the study of medieval Jewish history and an appreciation of his pioneering contribution to it. Shlomo Eidelberg edited a volume on Yitzhak Schipper, the martyred historian of Polish Jewry. It contains several scholarly appraisals of Schipper's contributions to Polish-Jewish history, a bibliography of his writings, and a selection of his papers. Besides his communal activities, Schipper's most significant work was his pioneering study of the economic history and legal status of Polish Jewry, based on general archival material. The The Scholarship of Bernard Revel by Sidney B. Hoenig pays tribute to one of the ideological architects of Yeshiva University, analyzing his manifold contributions to Jewish scholarship. Mention should be made here also of Gilbert Klaperman's The Story of Yeshiva University which traces the early history of this important American-Jewish institution, outlines its scholarly and educational achievements, and describes the state of Jewish education in the United States at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. STUDIES IN JUDAISM Religion,Religion, Philosophy, Mysticism A considerable number of the books in this category, published in 1968 1969, are reprints of older works, many with new introductions. It is to be hoped that their availability will stimulate a thorough reexamination of their subjects. Kaufmann Kohler's Jewish Theology was reissued with a new introduction by Joseph L. Blau who summarizes and assesses the significance of Kohler's theological system against the background of German rationalism and German-American Reform. It is a rationalistic, evolutionary, somewhat apologetic theology, void of the later mystical and sociological approach to Jewish theology. Another older work, an anthology of texts, also to be understood in light of nineteenth-century German Jewish scholarship, is Simon Bernfeld's The Foundation of Jewish Ethics. It was reprinted with a new introduction by Samuel E. Karff, who, in his summary of Bernfeld's views, calls attention to his basically optimistic notion and to the apologetic</page><page sequence="8">JEWISH SCHOLARSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES / 315 overtones of the book. Karff suggests that the time has come for a new compendium of Jewish ethics, taking into account the writings of such thinkers as Martin Buber and Leo Baeck, and of the problems presented by the Nazi holocaust and modern technology. With all its limitations, Bernfeld's book is rewarding reading. Seymour J. Cohen translated into beautiful English Orchot Tzaddikim, a popular, anonymous work of ethics that was published no less than 75 times since its first printing in 1581. In the introduction Cohen deals with the possible authorship of the work and the time of writing. He quotes Abraham J. Heschel on the similarities between this work and the writings of R. Yehiel, father of R. Asher (thirteenth century). Cohen places the book in the fifteenth century. Charles B. Chavel published three popular and frequently printed ethical works of Rabbenu Bahya. Their texts are based on first editions and manu scripts, and are copiously annotated. With this publication Chavel continues his earlier efforts to make available Bahya's Works in modern editions. Specific aspects of Rabbinic theology are the subject of Arthur Marmor stein's The Doctrine of Merits in Old Rabbinical Literature and The Old Rabbinic Rabbinic Doctrine of God. R. J. Zwi Werblowsky's new introduction to the two works, which are reprinted in one volume, is a positive appraisal of Marmorstein's careful, critical analysis of the well-defined doctrines of a certain group of Jewish teachers at a certain period. Marmorstein's compre hensive documentation is of lasting value; but the subjects deserve a fresh treatment in light of new textual and historical evidence, and of more recent theological insights. ProselytismProselytism in the Talmudic Period by Bernard Bamberger was reprinted with the author's new preface. Bamberger takes note of more recent re search, surveys the newer literature on the subject, and adds a few new insights which, however, do not alter his earlier basic conclusions. He mentions some criticism he received because "he overstressed the favorable attitude of the Rabbis towards proselytism." Bamberger concludes his introduction with a short discussion of the contemporary problem of proselytism. Joseph Abelson's The Immanence of God in Rabbinical Literature and Frederick R. Tennant's The Sources of the Doctrines of the Fall and Original Sin Sin were reissued in unchanged editions. Sectarian developments in Judaism and the relationship between Judaism and other great religions are investigated in a number of works. The Samaritans Samaritans by James A. Montgomery was reprinted with an introduction by Abraham S. Halkin. Halkin has high praise for the book, whose basic con elusions are still valid. The introduction summarizes the theology of the Samaritans, and reviews the long history of tensions between the sect and the Jews, establishing the construction of the Samaritan sanctuary on Mount Gerizim as the time when the definitive split between them occurred. Halkin</page><page sequence="9">316 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1970 also points to the remarkable shrinkage of the Samaritan community, and the lessening of tensions between it and the Jews in recent years in Israel. In The Samaritan Pentateuch James D. Purvis sets out to prove that the period of the sectarian redaction and promulgation of the Pentateuch by the Samaritans should be regarded as the time of their complete separation from Judaism. Purvis concludes from an examination of the textual tradi tions of the Samaritan Pentateuch in light of new evidence, including the Dead Sea Scrolls, that the emergence of the sect as an independent group followed prolonged development in the late Hasmonaean period. Leah Bronner's Sects and Separatism During the Second Jewish Common wealth wealth offers a short summary of the views of different scholars regarding such groups as the Hasidim, Pharisees, Essenes, and others. With the appearance of volume 13 of Erwin R. Goodenough's Jewish Symbols Symbols in the Greco-Roman Period, this monumental work is concluded. It contains indices, maps, and corrections for the preceding volumes. Samuel Sandmel's The First Christian Century in Judaism and Chris tianity,tianity, his most interesting and stimulating work, is an intellectually honest presentation of our limited knowledge of that crucial century in the history of religions. He speaks about the wealth of multiple explanations, implying the equivocal nature of the evidence at our disposal. With all this in mind, and with a stress on scholarly objectivity, he outlines his views on the several competing versions of Palestinian Judaisms, Hellenistic Judaism, and Chris tianity. Sandmel also authored a short introductory essay to the reprint of H. S. John Thackerey's Josephus, the Man and the Historian. Claude G. Montefiore's The Synoptic Gospels was republished with Lou H. Silberman's appraisal of the work. Montefiore, an aristocratic English Jew, approached the Gospels with sympathy and impartiality, holding in high regard the greatness and originality of the teachings of Jesus. A Jewish commentary on the New Testament, the book reflects the author's view of the links be tween early Christianity and Jewish traditions. Three older volumes of lectures were reprinted in one titled Judaism and Christianity.Christianity. Against the background of these volumes, Ellis Rivkin, in a substantial introduction, provides a review of scholarly opinions on the genesis, development, and nature of Pharisaism, the "binding motif" of the three volumes. Pharisaism, the basis of later developments in Judaism and a crucial element in the life of Jesus and Paul, is of tremendous interest to scholars. By citing some of the deficiencies of earlier studies, Rivkin presents an outline of his thinking on this crucial factor in the development of Judaism and Christianity. The development by the Pharisees of the concept of the two-fold law, written and oral, and its rejection by Christianity are the decisive points in the evolution of the two great religions. An anthology of Jewish refutations of the christological interpretation of The The The Fifty-Third Chapter of Isaiah, collected and translated by Samuel R. Driver and Adolf Neubauer, was published twice, by two different reprint</page><page sequence="10">JEWISH SCHOLARSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES / 317 publishers. One edition also includes the Hebrew text and has a new intro duction by Raphael Loewe, which gives the biographies of Driver and Neubauer, and refers to the more recent findings concerning the figure of Isaiah's "Suffering Servant." The influence of Judaism on Islam is the subject of The Jewish Founda tiontion of Islam by Charles C. Torrey. In Franz Rosenthal's new introduction we find a survey of recent insights into the problem, an analysis of Torrey's theory, and an appreciation of his life and contribution. In Rosenthal's view, Torrey went too far in assuming early Islam's dependence on Judaism. He points out that our knowledge is too limited for any definitive statements about the precise forms of Judaism, rabbinical or sectarian, or about other religious forms, such as Gnosticism, which might have been known in Central Arabia and were thus accessible to Muhammad, the Prophet. Among collective works, mention should be made of Religions in An tiquity,tiquity, a volume of essays in memory of Erwin R. Goodenough, edited by Jacob Neusner. It contains studies by foremost scholars in biblical religion, the history of Judaism and symbolism, and the history of religions. Another collection, Interpreting the Prophetic Tradition, presents a series of Golden son lectures on the beginnings and the nature of prophecy, and its medieval and modern interpretations. Medieval developments are analyzed in scores of other studies. Alexander Altmann, in Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism, deals with some of the major themes of medieval Jewish and Arabic philosophy and mysticism, such as the images of the Divine and anthropomorphism. Exten sive documentation based on Greek, Arabic, Christian, and Jewish sources enables us to follow the intricate ideas of medieval thinkers and mystics. The author points to the common patrimony of many of these concepts in medieval thought. Other sections of Altmann's book are devoted to the rabbinic doctrine of creation, certain aspects of Saadia's and Maimonides's philosophies, and, finally, to such modern thinkers as Moses Mendelssohn and Franz Rosenzweig. Isaac Barzilay's Between Reason and Faith examines the attitude of some famous Jewish scholars in Italy to the growing challenge of involvement with the general culture of their times. This general culture, represented by Greco-Islamic philosophy and, later, by Renaissance thought, evoked varying reactions among Jewish scholars. Some attempted a synthesis of the national communal, religious nature of Judaism and the skeptical, aristocratic notions of rationalism; others developed antirationalist tendencies in .defense of the spiritual values of Judaism. External circumstances, as persecutions and expulsions, on the one hand, and tolerant treatment of the Jews, on the other, influenced the intellectual attitudes of Italian-Jewish thinkers toward secular studies and culture. Through the analysis of the writings of men like Jacob Anatoli, Hillel of Verona, Isaac Abravanel, Joseph Yaavetz, Judah Moscato, and others, Barzilay establishes as characteristic an implicit</page><page sequence="11">318 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1970 trend of antirationalism in Italian Jewish thought from the mid-thirteenth to the mid-seventeenth century. Benjamin Ravid undertook to edit the scattered articles and important unpublished works of his late father, the great scholar and thinker Simon Rawidowicz, among them an ambitious "Introduction to a Philosophy of Jewish History." The first volume of this collection, lyyunim bemahshevet Yisrael:Yisrael: Hebrew Studies in Jewish Thought, contains fragments of that "Introduction," as well as works on Saadia and Maimonides. It also has a biography of Rawidowicz and a bibliography of his writings, prepared by Ravid. Maimonides is the subject of three books, published in 1968-1969: Abraham Cohen's anthology The Teachings of Maimonides was reissued with a new introduction by Marvin Fox. The writings are systematically classified around a number of philosophical, psychological, religious, and ethical concepts. In his introduction, Fox calls attention to modern research on Maimonides, especially that of Leo Strauss. He also discusses the many contradictory interpretations of Maimonides—to some he was a heretic, to others a model of orthodoxy—and stresses the difficulty of finding the true significance of his thoughts because of their obscurity and subtlety. What we can learn from Maimonides today, Fox says, is intellectual honesty, lack of dogmatism, and the realization of the possibilities and limits of reason. Jehuda Melber's The Universality of Maimonides is a short summary of his life, teachings, and influence on Western thought. Taking into account all Maimonides's writings, philosophical, ethical, and legal, Melber presents the philosophical ideas in a systematic fashion. He also discusses Maimonides as disciple of Aristotle, and where he diverges from the latter. Fred G. Bratton's Maimonides: Medieval Modernist is a popular compilation in tended mainly for the non-Jewish public. Bratton's aim was to fill a gap in Christian literature by presenting with objectivity, from a wider perspective, the life and work of one of the greatest Jewish philosophers. Emphasizing the insistence of Maimonides on "intelligence in religion," Bratton con centrâtes on his present relevance for Christians and Jews. Among unchanged reprints in this field are: Joseph Abelson, Jewish Mysticism;Mysticism; Joseph Sarachek, The Doctrine of the Messiah in Medieval Jewish Jewish Literature, and the standard work by Jacob Klatzkin, Thesaurus PhilosophicusPhilosophicus Linguae Hebraicae. Rabbinic Rabbinic Literature, Interpretation, and Law Though published by an Englishman in England, John Bowker's The TargiansTargians and Rabbinic Literature deserves inclusion in this survey of Ameri can publications. It is a long overdue, good, concise, and up-to-date intro duction to classical rabbinic literature. To a certain extent, it replaces Hermann Strack's earlier work on the subject. It takes into consideration new discoveries and research, relying heavily on the work of American and</page><page sequence="12">JEWISH SCHOLARSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES / 319 Israeli scholars. A large section of the book is devoted to selections in English translation from the Targumim, with commentary. The extensive bibliography makes the work eminently useful. Louis Finkelstein, in New Light from the Prophets, presents a most significant thesis having important implications for Jewish theology, litera ture, and the development of the system of ancient Jewish education. Proceeding from an examination of texts in tannaitic Midrashim in which the Prophets are mentioned, Finkelstein proposes that words of the Prophets were incorporated into these later structures. New elements should therefore be added to our knowledge of the Prophets: their contributions to academic teaching and to the development of specific norms in Judaism. Finkelstein concedes the difficulty of freeing one's self from the old notions concerning the nature of prophecy and the origins of rabbinic works. However, he strongly and convincingly advocates that a number of teachings, preserved mainly in the Mishna, Mekilta and Sifre, originate from prophetic times, some as early as the pre-exilic period. These teachings were transmitted orally and were included in the Midrashim by the Tannaim. The Charles Taylor edition and translation of The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers Fathers was reissued with a new introduction by Judah Goldin. While Goldin gives a warm appreciation of Taylor and his work, particularly the excellence of his commentary, he also points out the limitations of his translation rooted in the nineteenth-century concept of strict fidelity to the original. Max Kadushin, in A Conceptual Approach to the Mekilta, applies his well-known theory of the system of value concepts in rabbinic literature to the exegesis of a large section of the tannaitic Midrash, the Mekilta. In the introduction and commentary to the text, Kadushin discusses the emphatic trends in rabbinic literature, expressed in value concepts, such as Univer sality, Love of God and Israel, which form an integrated pattern and provide the key for a proper understanding of rabbinic texts. In his book on Siphre Zutta, Saul Lieberman establishes the place and date of origin and defines the characteristics of this tannaitic Midrash on the Book of Numbers. The complete Midrash text is not known today; we have it only in fragments and quotations by later rabbis. With his extraordinary erudition, Lieberman isolates all elements that make Siphre Zutta different from other rabbinic sources. He speaks of the distinct style, terminology, and different halakhah represented in the work; enumerates those rabbis who are mentioned only in this halakhic Midrash, and con eludes that Siphre Zutta is a work of the end of the tannaitic period, edited by a rabbi who did not accept the authority of Judah ha-Nasi. It is the product of the academies of Southern Palestine, probably Lydda, and not Galilee. In the course of the discussion, Lieberman elucidates a number of rabbinic passages, and refutes some of the methodological deficiencies in the work of modern scholars on the subject.</page><page sequence="13">320 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1970 William G. Braude continued to make available in English translation the classics of rabbinic literature, this time the aggadic Midrash Pesikta Rabbati. The fine translation is augmented with notes, summaries, indices, and an introduction. Braude offers a description of the text, its form, contents, and peculiarities. Reviewing the conflicting views on time and place of the work's origin, ranging from the fourth to the ninth centuries, and from Palestine to Greece and Italy, Braude proposes that the work was edited in Palestine in the sixth-seventh century, though, of course, it contains much older elements. To his new edition of The Passover Haggadah Nahum N. Glatzer added a selection of rabbinic and other readings relating to the Passover. The tannaitic Midrash Siphre, edited by Louis Finkelstein, was reprinted. Only a few copies of the original edition, which appeared in 1939 in Berlin, were saved from the Nazis. In a short preface to the reprint, Finkelstein summarizes the tasks to be undertaken for a new, revised editing of the text. Moses Schwab's translation of the first tractate of the The Talmud of Jerusalem Jerusalem was reissued as an unchanged reprint. David Halivni-Weiss applies his critical method for an understanding of the talmudic texts in Sources and Traditions, a major commentary on Seder Nashim of the Babylonian Talmud. In the concise introduction, Halivni Weiss defines his approach as source-critical; there must be a distinction between the original form of the sources and their later developments. Though it is well known that the rabbis of the Talmud insisted on a faithful and careful transmission of rabbinic sayings, certain variations developed, and the altered sources became part of the tradition. These variants sometimes forced the rabbis to apply artificial explanations. A rediscovery of the original framework of the sources must make it possible to arrive at their simple meaning, the Peshat. Halivni-Weiss classifies the variations as unconscious changes made by oral transmitters and as editorial changes. Other textual difficulties can be resolved by determining the original his torical setting of the source, as well as by recognizing that the later text preserves equally authoritative sources that contradict the original. The The Commentary to Mishna Aboth by Moses Maimonides has been made available for the first time in an annotated English translation by Arthur David. In the introduction, David describes the significance and place of Mishna Aboth (Sayings of the Fathers) in the Mishna, as well as Maimon ides's system of ethics, as manifested in his commentary. David mentions episodes from the personal life and communal relationships of Maimonides to prove that his personal virtues were based on the consistent, practical application of his system of ethical norms. The first volume of the new annual, P'raqim, contains several major articles by American and Israeli scholars on certain aspects of rabbinic literature and medieval philosophy and poetry. Some works of medieval Talmud commentators are still unpublished. A</page><page sequence="14">JEWISH SCHOLARSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES / 321 product of the continuing effort to make them available in critical editions is Shamma Friedman's careful and thorough edition of The Commentary of of R. Jonathan Ha-Kohen of Lunel on the Mishnah and Alfasi Tractate Bava Bava Kamma. The text is based on manuscripts and Geniza fragments, which are meticulously examined from the paleographical point of view, and is critically annotated. In the introduction Friedman describes the life and contribution of R. Jonathan of Lunel and his place in medieval rabbinic literature. Most likely, R. Jonathan was the first in a quite long succession of scholars who wrote commentaries on the halakhic work of Alfasi. Fried man also discusses his unusual interpretation of the Mishna and the Gemara and the insights we gain from his commentary on the text. A number of important medieval commentaries were collected, mainly from manuscripts, and published in two volumes by Moshe Y. Blau under the title, Shittath ha'Kadmonim. One is devoted to tractate Baba Metzia and the other to tractate Aboda Zara. In his introductory remarks Blau provides a short biography of the scholars whose works are included. Unchanged reprints dealing with Geonic literature include Louis Ginz berg's Geonica; the three-volume set of Genizah Studies in Memory of Doctor Doctor Solomon Schechter which, in addition to Geonic texts, also contains earlier Midrashim and later texts of secular and liturgical poetry; and Henry Malter's Saadia, His Life and Works. Talmudic-midrashic and medieval rabbinic interpretation of the Bible, the Aramaic and other translations of the biblical text, and the Masorah—the system of vowels, accents and orthographic rules relating to the Hebrew text of the Bible—are the subjects of a number of books published in the last few years. Menahem M. Kasher continued the publication of his monumental TorahTorah Shelemah. The twenty-third volume concludes the treatments of the Book of Exodus. In it we find an encyclopedia of texts taken from the full range of the literature of the Talmud and Midrash, arranged in the sequence of the biblical verses, and explained and illuminated by Kasher. He also includes relevant passages from a most important recently discovered Targum Yerushalmi manuscript. In the fourth volume of his The Bible in Aramaic, Alexander Sperber publishes the text of the Targumim to the Book of Chronicles and to the Five Scrolls. Sperber characterizes these texts as "Midrash in disguise of Targum," representing, as such, the transition from translation to Midrash. Though dealing with a more recent period, two books devoted to Bible translation should be included here. Notes on the New Translation of the Torah,Torah, edited by Harry M. Orlinsky, gives the philosophy and philological considerations underlying the recent Jewish Publication Society translation of the Torah. The editor's introduction emphasizes that, besides the results of modern archeological, historical, and linguistic research, the works of the traditional interpreters of the Bible were utilized. The insights of these commentators, from the earliest rabbis through the great medieval exegetes,</page><page sequence="15">322 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1970 like Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and others, to modern scholars like Luzzatto and Malbim, were frequently found to be valid today, and their contributions command the respect of modern critical biblical scholarship. The German Translations Translations of the Pentateuch by William Weintraub discusses the history, methods, tendencies, and problems of the various German translations of the Bible. Weintraub distinguishes two major trends in these works: the attempt to achieve literal faithfulness and the desire to reflect certain ide ologies. Analyzing the translations by Luther, Mendelssohn, Zunz, Hirsch, Buber-Rosenzweig and Tur-Sinai, the author cites the sources used and points to discernible influences. The treatments by the various translators of certain grammatical categories, personal names, Divine names, and anthropomor phistic, philosophical, and polemical passages take up a considerable portion of the book. The hitherto unpublished Commentaries of R. Meyuhas ben Elijah on Deuteronomy Deuteronomy and Job were made available in the works of Michael Katz and Charles Chavel. Katz used a manuscript of the British Museum, Chavel the photograph of a unique manuscript, which once was in Warsaw but was lost during World War II. R. Meyuhas lived at the time of the Byzantine empire, but scholars disagree on the exact period. Some date him in the twelfth century, some as late as the fifteenth. The editors preface their books with an introduction discussing the author's life, work, and method. The commentary is philological in character, trying to arrive at the simple meaning of the biblical texts. In the field of Masorah studies, reprints appeared of Romain Butin's The Ten Ten Nequodoth of the Torah, with a new introduction by Shemaryahu Talmon. Christian D. Ginsburg's edition of two masoretic works by Jacob ben ben Chajim and by Elias Levita, with a new introduction by Norman H. Snaith, and Solomon Frensdorff's Massorah Magna, with Gérard E. Weil's new introduction. Talmon summarizes the new insights into the problem of the origin and function of the extraordinary points that are found over certain letters and words in the Pentateuch. According to Butin, they indi cate spurious texts and point to deletions. On the other hand, Talmon believes that their function is that of a rather general "nota bene." Norman Snaith's introduction defines the two basic approaches in the study of the Masorah. One, originating with Elijah Levita is concerned with the accuracy, interpretation, and application of masoretic and grammatical rules; the other, whose first representative was the apostate Jacob ben Hayyim, collects and collates manuscripts, and out of these presents an eclectic masoretic text. Followers of Levita and of Jacob ben Hayyim can be traced throughout the last four centuries, even among modern scholars. Snaith also deals with the different traditions of the Masorah, as well as with the problem of the pos sibility of establishing a true masoretic text. Weil summarizes the insights gained from new approaches to the study of Masorah. His introduction also contains biograpnical material on Frensdorff.</page><page sequence="16">JEWISH SCHOLARSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES / 323 A timely aspect of Jewish law is examined by David M. Feldman in Birth Birth Control in Jewish Law. Feldman presents a unified, systematic picture of the Jewish view on birth control and related issues, based on primary sources collected from the Talmud and post-talmudic codes and responsa, as well as from nonlegal works. Making use of a wealth of material, Feldman presents both the positive and the negative aspects of Jewish law regulating marital relations, contraception, and abortion. He distinguishes stricter and more lenient trends within Jewish law, as well as differences between the Christian and the Jewish attitudes on the question. Emphasizing the dynamism of Jewish law, Feldman takes the discussion of the problem up to the present. Louis M. Epstein's Sex Laws and Customs in Judaism was reprinted with an introduction by Ari Kiev in which the sound psychological validity of traditional Jewish sex laws are stressed. Epstein's book is based on biblical, talmudic, medieval, and modern sources. David W. Amram's The The Jewish Law of Divorce is now available as an unchanged reprint. The concept of the authority of state law in civil matters, as granted by rabbinic law, is examined by Leo Landman in Jewish Law in the Diaspora. In a chronological treatment, Landman presents data concerning the genesis, development, and application of Jewish acceptance in certain cases of the jurisdiction of non-Jewish courts. The origin of this principle, Dina D'MalkhuthaD'Malkhutha Dina (the law of the kingdom is the law), goes back to third century Babylonia, and is attributed to acknowledgment of the divine right of the kings. The book concludes with a discussion of questions arising from the application of this legal principle in the modern era. David Daube's important Studies in Biblical Law, also dealing with later developments, and Samuel Mendelsohn's The Criminal Jurisprudence of the Ancient Hebrews Hebrews were reissued without changes or additions. LITERATURE, ART, MUSIC AND SCIENCE Moses Gaster's The Example of the Rabbis, a collection of 450 tales and anecdotes, was republished with a new introduction by William G. Braude. Braude reviews the controversy regarding the dating of the collection: All the scholars disagree with Gaster's contention that the material dates from the fourth century; they rather propose a late medieval period, though, of course, some of the tales may have had their origin in antiquity. The tales can be grouped according to central motifs, such as the boons of study and piety, punishment of wickedness, and resistance to temptation. As a whole, the book is a notable contribution to the study of Jewish folklore. Harris Fletcher's Milton's Rabbinical Readings was reprinted without change. With the publication of the seventh volume of the important and frequently consulted Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur ("Biographical Dictionary of Modern Yiddish Literature"), this major reference work is nearing completion.</page><page sequence="17">324 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1970 Bezalel Narkiss published an attractive album of 60 reproductions of Hebrew Illuminated Illuminated Manuscripts, whose originals are in the major libraries of the world. Narkiss classifies the manuscripts by origin: Oriental, Spanish, French, German, and Italian. He deals with the peculiar Jewish element in manu script illumination, e.g., the use of the illuminated word rather than initial letter, which creates the designs by micrography, the use of minute script. The book is proof that the Second Commandment did not smother Jewish artistic expression in the Middle Ages. Music Music in Ancient Israel by Alfred Sendrey examines the biblical and talmudic references to musical practice, musical instruments, and the dance. Against the background of ancient Near Eastern material, Sendrey deals with the musical aspects of the Psalms; the origins and functions of music in biblical times, and the problems of biblical cantillation and other ancient Jewish melodies. A very neglected field, the history of the sciences among the Jews, was enriched by Bernard M. Goldstein's edition of Ibn al-Muthanna's Com mentarymentary on the Astronomical Tables of al-Khwarizmi. The original Arabic work is no longer in existence; it is only known from Hebrew and Latin translations. The close relationship of Islamic, Christian, and Jewish scien tists in the Middle Ages is a fascinating phenomenon. Goldstein presents the texts of two Hebrew versions of the work, and establishes that the author of one was Abraham ibn Ezra. Goldstein's work is also important for the study of medieval Hebrew scientific terminology. Menahem H.
