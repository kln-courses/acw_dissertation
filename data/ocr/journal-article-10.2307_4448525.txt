<plain_text><page sequence="1">How-To-Do-It Ecological Awareness in the Biology Classroom Deborah E. Reichert Ecological Awareness in Perspective The impetus to teach ecology gained its greatest momentum in the 1960s and early 1970s. A variety of curricular materials was produced during that era, and schools strived to keep up with the ecology movement by offering environmental science courses and by stressing energy con- servation. Earth Day, Zero Population Growth, and the banning of DDT were hallmarks of this era. The energy crisis of the 1970s spawned public in- terest in recycling, alternative home energy sources and gas-saving cars. Recession and inflation, coupled with a renewed interest in outdoor activi- ties, caused a concern for diminishing resources. By the late 1970s, ecology had be- come a household word, but the envi- ronmental movement was fading. An improving economy, cheaper fuel and the end of the Viet Nam era of unrest lulled us into believing that the envi- ronment was being managed ade- quately. The newly-founded EPA and a series of federal acts to protect en- dangered species, wetlands and wild- lands, caused us to believe that "Big Brother" was watching over the envi- ronment. The 1980s have been characterized by severe governmental cutbacks in federal conservation programs and cleanup funds. In education, state propositions have eliminated enrich- ment programs and forced a return to basics. Biology textbooks still include units on the environment, but often they are tucked at the end of the book, where they are in danger of being eliminated in the year-end rush to complete the text. Ecology in the Biology Curriculum Biology is a hands-on, visual science, which is part of its appeal vis-a-vis the physical sciences. The hands-on experience can be extended into the local environment in any set- ting-urban or rural. We should feel particularly committed to including ecology in our biology curricula in an era of increased waste, energy usage and world population growth. Most students are apt to forget ribosomes and RNA; but many will benefit from a life-long appreciation of the natural world if introduced to it during their formal education. There are two ways to integrate eco- logical studies into the science curric- ulum. The year-long ecology course can focus on basic principles of eco- system development, energy and pol- lution, with labs concentrating on field work. This should be an upper- level course, with an introductory bi- ology course as a prerequisite. The second method of integrating ecological awareness into the biology curriculum is by incorporating out- door labs into the traditional biology course. All biological principles come into play in an ecosystem. Here plants and animals are no longer static units for discussion and dissection, but living, interacting organisms. Stu- dents should view the outdoor labs not as a recess from lecture or lab, but as an opportunity to investigate the living world as it really is. Outdoor Labs and Classroom Projects I will describe four outdoor labs and several other projects which I have used successfully in my introductory biology course. The labs usually re- quire one 90-minute period, and some library research. (1) Investigating the Food Web in a Terrestrial Ecosystem This lab can be done in a city park, a local wooded area, or even on the school playground. The purpose is to identify as many organisms as pos- sible in a predetermined area (or quadrat), and then to place the or- ganisms in a schematic food web. Field guides to mammals, birds and insects are useful identification aids. Students enjoy the detective work in- volved in this lab. Signs, tracks or calls as well as actual sightings should be considered evidence of animals. A live trap may be used to capture small mammals, but care must be used to check the trap frequently and to re- lease the animals quickly after obser- vations are made. Be sure to turn over rotting logs for evidence of decom- posers such as fungi, earthworms and millipedes. The concepts of energy flow, trophic levels, predation and de- composition should be discussed be- fore the lab. Students should con- struct a food web, showing interrela- tionships, at the conclusion of the lab. (2) Animal Behavior In this lab, students choose one species of bird, mammal or inverte- brate to observe closely for several days. Some choices include squirrels, sparrows, pigeons or spiders. In making and recording observations, students should look for evidence of territoriality, feeding habits, competi- tion and communication. Caution stu- dents to avoid anthropomorphic inter- pretations of animal behavior. Stu- dents can use reference materials to supplement their knowledge of the species, but their reports should be based primarily on their own observa- tions. Spotting scopes or binoculars can be used to observe the animals without disturbing them. (3) The Pond Ecosystem A local lake or pond is an ideal place Deborah E. Reichert is chair of the Science Department at Wilbraham and Monson Academy, Wilbraham, MA 01095. She re- ceived her A.B. from Smith College (1971) and a M.F.S. from Yale University (1982). She has worked for the National Audubon Society at the Maine Ecology Camp (1980) and as a National Park Service Ranger at Cape Cod National Seashore and Isle Royale National Park (1969-1971). She served on the Higher Education Com- mittee at the First National Congress for Environmental Education Futures (1983) and recently presented a paper, upon which this article is based, at the NABT convention in Baltimore. Reichert has taught at St. Mark's School (Southboro, MA), The Hotchkiss School (Lakeville, CT), and The Masters School (Dobbs Ferry, NY). She currently teaches environmental science and Advanced Placement Biology. 298 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 49, NO. 5, MAY 1987</page><page sequence="2">to observe reptiles, birds, fish and mammals in their native habitat. Be sure to bring dip nets, collecting jars and buckets on this trip, and advise students to wear old sneakers so they can wade in the pond to collect samples. You can use a LaMotte water test kit to analyze samples for dis- solved oxygen, nitrates, phosphates and other nutrients. These kits are available from most biological supply companies. The results of the tests can be compared to tolerable levels of these chemicals for drinking water. You can use a minnow trap baited with raw hamburger to capture small fish, tadpoles and crayfish. These can be maintained easily in an aquar- ium for further observation in the classroom. Water samples can be ob- served under the microscope for evi- dence of algae and microorganisms. The organisms observed often are a clue to the biological condition of the pond. Discuss eutrophication and sources of water pollution before the lab. The pond study might stimulate discussion on acid rain and its effects on aquatic ecosystems. Students may follow up on this lab with library research on local water pollution problems. (4) Primary and Secondary Succession A rock, a disturbed area or a re- cently burned area are good places to study primary succession. Students should stake out quadrats in the study area and record the percentage of space covered by each species of pio- neer plant. The typical progression is lichens -- moss -- ferns -+ angio- sperms. Students should measure the depth of soil associated with each plant type. You can use a soil ther- mometer and light meter to record mi- crocimatic variations. Secondary succession typically occurs in old fields, cleared areas or abandoned gardens or farms. Stu- dents should employ the quadrat method for determining dominant vegetation types. They should look for evidence of animals associated with secondary succession, such as rabbits, deer and mice. The typical sequence for secondary succession in the north- east is grasses -) perennials -o thorny shrubs -&gt; softwoods -* hardwoods. A vacant lot is a good place to study sec- ondary succession in urban areas. Prior to the lab, discuss the concept of the steady state, or "climax" commu- nity. Point out the factors that can in- fluence succession, such as fire, pre- cipitation and human disturbance. Students should write a report com- paring the two types of succession in terms of dominant vegetation, abiotic influences and the relative time in- volved in each type of succession. (5) Collections Collections of pressed plants, winter twigs or insects promote un- derstanding of habitat and taxonomy. Materials for these projects are readily obtainable and inexpensive. You may want to set up a bird feeder outside of the classroom, and have the students record the species and numbers of birds seen. Encourage students to bring in specimens they find at home for discussion and identification. (6) Problem-Solving You can set up a weekly nature "mystery" in the classroom and have the students try to solve it by using reference materials. The "mystery" could be a skull, a gall, a cocoon or any item of interest from the local en- vironment. You may want to correlate your "mystery" with the chapter being studied that week. Students can earn extra credit for the number of mysteries they solve. In-Service Enrichment for Biology Teachers The best way to integrate field studies successfully into your curric- ulum is from your own knowledge of the environment. The National Au- dubon Society sponsors adult ecology camps during the summer, which em- phasize field studies and the hands-on approach to learning. (For information write Audubon Ecology Camps and Workshops, National Environmental Education Center, 613 Riversville Road, Greenwich, CT 06831-9990). Re- gional conservation groups offer workshops and field trips which will help familiarize you with the local en- vironment. Posters and pamphlets for your classroom can be obtained from utility companies and state conserva- tion organizations. The teacher who is a birder, nature photographer or out- doorsman willbe a more knowledge- able and enthusiastic field trip leader. The Peanuts character Pigpen said, "If you're going to be an ecologist, you have to stir things up a little." You will find that outdoor studies stir up your students' enthusiasm for science. The hazards- dirty hands, wet feet or insect bites-are a small price to pay for experiential leaming. The intrigue of field studies is dis- covery, for the natural world is never static like the prepared slide or the preserved animal. You will find the hands-on approach to ecology through outdoor studies will be a wel- come alternative to the traditional lab or lecture. Your students will benefit from an increased awareness of, and appreciation for, the natural world. Most importantly, you will be pro- moting an ecological awareness in your students, which will make them better citizens in the future. Useful References Borror, Donald J. &amp; White, Richard E.
