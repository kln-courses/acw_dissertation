<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECEPTION David S. Areford Employed across a range of fields and contexts, including astrology, hos pitality, broadcasting, and American football, the English term "reception" origi nated—according to the Oxford English Dictionary—from Anglo-Norman and French (recepcion, réception) and the Latin noun receptio, formed with recept-, the past participial stem of the verb recipere (to receive). Among its various mean ings, reception is repeatedly defined as "the action of receiving," "acquiring," or "taking in" something, whether a person, an object, or an idea (OED, l.b-c, 2.a, 3.a-b, 4.a). Based on the cited usages, a specifically physical and spatial under standing of the term developed in the late fifteenth century (3.a); and a more gen eral notion of reception as a mental action, synonymous with "comprehension," dates to the early seventeenth century (3.b). The dictionary definitions have yet to include meanings connected to the realms of vision or the visual arts. Yet the term is quite common in popular under standings of theater, especially in the qualitative reception given to a performer on stage (4.b). In such instances reception is embodied by a collective audience (cheering or jeering). Connected to this meaning, the OED cites a recent textbook that frames reception in a more theoretical fashion. In Drama and Theatre Studies (2000) the authors declare: "Any study of theatre must hold this as a prerequisite: theatre is a performance art focused upon audience reception.'" The foregrounding of the audience—as opposed to the author, the text, and the text's performance— comes closest to art history's interest in reception as a fruitful area of investigation. In the last three decades, art historians have increasingly turned away from questions of style, attribution, and production to focus on issues involving viewers and reception, which, in the language of the definitions above, involves the audi ence's action of receiving, acquiring, or taking in the visual object. For art history, this shift in emphasis occurred gradually in response to theoretical propositions first championed in other disciplines, such as literary studies and anthropology. Most dramatically, literary theory began to dismantle traditional notions of author and text. For the French post-structuralists Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault, the author could no longer be seen as the stable, determining agent of meaning. With the "death of the author," literary studies offered a new way of understanding © 2012 by the Board of Trustees of Western Michigan University</page><page sequence="2">74 David S. Areford the text in terms of the reader's contribution.2 Especially important was the recep tion theory or reception aesthetics (Rezeptionsästhetik) championed by the 1960s German Constance school, the impact of which was felt more broadly with the English translations of key works by Hans Robert Jauss, Wolfgang Iser, and others in the late 1970s and 80s.3 These scholars and those who followed their lead made the reader preeminent, stressing the "role of the reader," the "act of reading," and the "reader in the text."4 These developments in literary studies coincided with a general rejection of canonical notions of the art object, as art historians and other scholars became increasingly interested in the products of a more inclusive "visual culture."5 Fur thermore, new ambitious and innovative histories of art have shifted the discipline's focus to viewers and their response. Two works were particularly influential, how ever contentious: David Freedberg's The Power of Images: Studies in the History and Theory of Response (1989) and Hans Belting's Bild und Kult: Eine Geschichte des Bildes vor dem Zeitalter der Kunst (1990).6 In these seminal studies of visual objects and their functions, the semantic and conceptual differentiation of "art" and "image" was a crucial distinction, especially for those who study medieval religious art. One could argue that medievalists have long been at the forefront of recep tion studies, in that artistic anonymity is a commonplace aspect of most medieval images, and a devotional function (as opposed to an exclusively aesthetic one) is often a central concern when reconstructing meaning. Although our notion of reception is typically limited to a viewer's comprehension and interpretation of meaning (iconographie, symbolic, conceptual), in this short essay I explore a more expansive understanding. As a productive case study, fourteenth- and fifteenth century images of the side wound of Christ reveal not only a cerebral process of seeing and decoding but also a multisensory experience in which a mix of pious and practical desires guide emotional, corporeal, material, and spatial responses.7 Among the most powerful manifestations of medieval piety are images of Christ's side wound isolated from his body and treated as an independent motif. One variation of the theme is found in a Cistercian prayer book produced in Bel gium around 1440, now Walters MS 218 (Fig. I).8 As the culminating image in a series of eight illuminations for the Hours of the Cross, the side wound is depicted as a gaping, vertical slash in the center of a cloth held by two angels. Following the standard scenes of the Passion narrative, the bleeding wound serves as a sum mation of Christ's suffering and death, acting as an explicit sign of bodily pain as well as an abstract and otherworldly vision. As such, the wound inspires a visceral, flinching discomfort, and it also invites a lingering, immersive meditation in which the physical is transcended. Further, the image's simplicity belies a visual and conceptual complexity that slowly reveals itself. Although the disembodied wound</page><page sequence="3">Reception 75 Fig. 1. The Side Wound on a Cloth. Baltimore, The Walters Art Museum, MS W.218, fol. 28v. (Photo: The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore.)</page><page sequence="4">76 David S. Areford is made legible by the suspended cloth, its status within the miniature's pictorial play of two and three dimensions is unstable. While the cloth and the background's glittering diaper pattern create a shallow space, the wound's black center suggests a deep recess, an entrance drawing one through and beyond the image. This sense of an opening is echoed in the angels' outstretched wings and the tiny blossoms dotting the background and margins. The motif's inherent ambiguity is also demonstrated by an illumination in an English book of hours made for the Bohun family between 1361 and 1373, now Pommersfelden, Schlossbibliothek, MS 348 (2934) (Fig. 2).9 Here the wound is joined by several other fragmentary references in the form of the arma Christi, or the Instruments of the Passion.10 Arranged in a grid, these objects and emblem atic abbreviations are designed to prompt mental re-creations of the Passion's key events, two of which—the Crucifixion and the Flagellation—are depicted along the central axis. These two scenes are formally linked to the composition below, where the red side wound is surrounded by angels and rises from a sarcophagus, suggestive of the resurrected Christ or the Man of Sorrows." Symmetrical and upright, the wound gains an anthropomorphic quality that clarifies a synecdochic relationship with Christ's body. Moreover, the equivalence of body and wound literalizes the gory outcome of textual and visual elaborations of the Flagellation in which Jesus is reduced to nothing but bleeding flesh, or as the English mystic Richard Rolle wrote, "many wounds in one wound."12 Beyond these compositional and formal clues, it is the wound's verticality and swelling shape that immediately indicate the Savior's body. This is the form of the mandorla, the radiance that surrounds Jesus in scenes such as the Transfigura tion and Ascension. In these moments of epiphany the mandorla makes visible the space where Christ's humanity and divinity coexist. Thus the wound's shape aptly communicates the relationship of part and whole, human and divine, sacred wound and sacred body. Yet, as in the Walters manuscript, the wound hovers perpetu ally in between meanings, always transforming before our eyes—a chameleon, a shape-shifter. It simultaneously suggests a bloody gash, an abstract body, and a radiant portal through the gold background. And the framing angels complicate these various interpretations. Are they holding the wound in place? Pulling at its edges? Opening it wider? Faced with such ambiguity, medieval viewers confronted the very limits of their individual devotional practice. Although the mandorla-shaped wound suggested the presence of Christ's body and the totality of his suffering, its fleshy form certainly encouraged other corporeal associations. In this regard, several scholars have explored the erotic, gendered, and psychosexual aspects of these images, interpreting the wound as a not-so-veiled substitute for the vulva or vagina. Such analyses partly depend on medieval mystical and devotional texts that metaphorically articulated spiritual</page><page sequence="5">Reception 77 ? ^ . 1 ugp t t Fig. 2. Arma Christi.

Areford union in physical and sexual terms. As the focus of both male and female devotees, Christ's body was explicitly made female or allowed to occupy a space between sexes. According to Flora Lewis, the figurative play was not limited to a purely het erosexual model; and thus the feminized side wound permitted a range of meanings related to "union, incorporation, and rebirth."13 For Karma Lochrie, the conflation of bleeding wound and vagina perfectly expressed the complex nature of "mystical sex"; for the truly devout, the soul's union with the divine was often characterized by "violence, suffering, and torture."14 A broader cultural context is explored by Martha Easton, who interprets the side wound images as inversions of medieval notions of female anatomy and sexuality in which the vagina, as an "insatiable, dangerous mouth," was correlated with the mouth-like entrance to hell.15 Indeed, a mouth-wound analogy is expressed in several illuminations and prints in which the wound is depicted horizontally. In a German single-sheet woodcut, now in Berlin, a gaping, lateral opening in the middle of an oversized heart dominates a collection of arma Christi (Fig. 3).16 Like the cloth in the Walters miniature, the heart was another typical way of framing the disembodied wound. In this case even a brief analysis of the image reveals a subtle overall composition suggestive of a face, with the wound as a thin-lipped mouth and one of the hanging scourges as a winking eye with long lashes. Although the idea of the wound-as mouth apparently found no overt expression in medieval Passion tracts, the trope was employed in other texts, from fifth-century hagiographie narratives to late medieval medical literature.17 In the Berlin woodcut, like many other similar depictions, the side wound is grossly out of proportion relative to the surrounding arma Christi. Along with its abstract and simplified form, the wound's prominent size allows it to morph into its various guises—body, portal, vagina, mouth. However, the large scale is also crucial to another sort of visual and devotional complexity. Along the bottom of the Berlin print, a xylographie inscription reveals that the "red slash on the heart gives the exact length and width of the side wound of our Lord Jesus Christ."18 In the late middle ages the wound's precise dimensions were believed to have been known, thus images of this type depict the wound as life-size. This sacred measure was explained by various origin stories, including visionary encounters in which a close-up view of Christ's body allowed an examination of his wounds.19 Other stories tell of the measure preserved as a relic in Constantinople and later trans ported to Charlemagne in a gold chest carried by an angel.20 The measure's status as a relic and its heavenly delivery are indicated in many images by the presence of angels. In the Walters miniature the angels are combined with a suspended cloth that presents the side wound as a kind of vera icon, equivalent to famous textile relics, such as the Veronica veil and the Shroud of Turin, that preserve life-size images of Christ (Fig. I).21</page><page sequence="7">Reception 79 &amp;» nm*pv&amp;*fr *% s*p^L!r ■ t***i* im* ^ c^r.^.V «» fr'gaw - vajb*. tfit i* aft" Iffliom'-ooQgtn,V«n »&lt;ug &lt;&gt;Ht «g fftia?iriy vus** vw* m 5a# vW xvdJOi lf»9" Vn"V**Jj*_11 to wwiW^r-K Fig. 3.

(Photo: Bildarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz / Art Resource, New York.)</page><page sequence="8">80 David S. Areford The wound's exact dimensions are also featured in another late fifteenth century German woodcut, now in Munich (Fig. 4).22 Of the many painted and printed versions, this image offers the most explicit expression of the wound as substitute for Christ's body. The print is like a devotional kit complete with textual and schematic directions that clearly communicate the goal: to construct the body of Christ through the joining of the side wound, the cross, the titulus, the three nails, the heart, the Veronica veil, and the wounded hands and feet. Thus the side wound quite literally becomes a miniature version of Christ's body. This visual and devotional construction is further animated by another popular medieval mea surement revealed in the inscription on the right. When multiplied forty times, the "little cross within the wound" yields Christ's height. Thus the diagrammatic and symbolic image is enlivened by realistic, spatial dimensions that ultimately depend on the viewer's own body as the essential reference point. The bodily link between viewer and image is further reinforced by the print's inscriptions, which specifically stipulate a physical interaction. In exchange for seven years indulgence and protection from "sudden death and misfortune," the devotee must not only meditate "with remorse and sorrow" but also kiss the wound and cross. A kiss is also required by the Berlin woodcut, and thus its mouth-like wound becomes a visual cue for a very specific and intimate tactile experience (Fig. 3). In terms of the Munich print, the reading of the directions requires the sheet's rotation so that the vertical mandorla-wound is made horizontal and thus transformed into a mouth. The act of kissing and the potential rewards suggest that the image of the life-size wound was valued primarily as a powerful, apotropaic amulet. As such, the print's portability and malleability allowed for a range of practices related to an amuletic function, from affixing the image to a household wall to folding or rolling it to slip into a container or carry close to the body.23 Indeed, bodily engagement was essential to other examples of the measure of the wound and the body of Christ. In a late fifteenth-century French illuminated version, now Princeton University Library MS 138.44, the accompanying texts indicate that it was designed to be used by both men and women.24 For a bar ren woman, the inscriptions instruct the placing of the measure of Christ, a Latin prayer, and a candle on her body. A woman in labor who wears the measure of the wound will have a delivery free of complications. For men, the protective pow ers targeted specifically masculine dangers; armed with the life-size wound and a short Latin prayer, the bearer will be protected "from his enemies and he shall not die from sudden death." Indeed, both men and women who wear the measure of the wound will be protected from "sudden death" and not be injured by "fire, water, storm, arrow, spear, knife, sword nor by any enemy." Although more gen eral, the Munich woodcut's promise of protection from "sudden death and misfor tune" clearly applied to a range of situations and dangers. Thus the print's life-size</page><page sequence="9">Reception 81 ■r+y-Jf * in ! ,0-Stf ■ « ™ * +J&gt; •"*«% m, • W , » 7 * • Ö "» ; fe &amp; S ; I. ■* {- V- C.J , £«'t?

Areford depiction was meaningful on both literal and metaphoric levels, equally suggestive of birth and death, the female genitalia and the wounds of war. The iconographie, perceptual, and corporeal responses triggered by images of the life-size wound found an even more complex expression in a seemingly sim ple woodcut of the Sacred Heart, ca. 1465 (Fig. 5).25 Once owned by the Nurem berg physician and humanist Hartmann Schedel, the print was inserted in a volume of devotional texts compiled while Schedel was studying medicine in Padua.26 When initially acquired, the woodcut included only the xylographie inscription at the top indicating that the heart had been "pierced through by the lance of our Lord Jesus Christ." This is visualized by a diagonal black wound that intersects the red heart. Yet the wound is combined with an easily missed detail: along its length is an actual slit through the paper sheet. One of a class of images referred to as Speerbilder, the print was designed to be cut by the Holy Lance, the star attraction of the annual display of imperial relics in Nuremberg's marketplace.27 Like the metal badges and other souvenirs collected by thousands of pilgrims drawn to the event, images pierced by the sacred lance offered a physical and permanent link to its presence by serving as secondary or contact relics. The literal opening in the image heightens an awareness of its materiality and thus encourages a closer examination. On the print's reverse the pigment used to color the heart appears to have seeped through the diagonal cut, resulting in a messy red puddle (Fig. 6). Thus another image is revealed, one even more minimal and abstract than the printed heart on the front. Here we are faced with the bloody side wound itself. Although such an "image" might be dismissed as accidental, the print's reverse and the slit through the paper were clearly integral to its meaning and authenticity. The result of printing, painting, and piercing, the woodcut is an indexical simulation in which the depicted wound becomes a real opening repro ducing the exact dimensions of the wound of Christ. The print's special, extra-representational qualities are explicitly acknowl edged by Schedel's manipulations, starting with the way the sheet is integrated into his devotional codex. Instead of gluing the woodcut to a blank folio, its right edge is stitched into the binding so that it becomes a page. In this way, the print asserts a surprising multidimensionality with a front and back that become two equal sides, as well as an in-between space created by the slit in the paper. As a bloody page, the woodcut illustrates a creative variation on a popular medieval trope that equated the body and wounds of Christ with a book's pages covered in text.28 When the print is viewed as Christ's body, it is the reverse that depicts the lance's entry wound and the front that presents the wounded heart within, thus thoroughly challenging the typical understanding of the print's front and back and converting them into an inside and outside. This situation is further complicated by the puddle of red paint.

Areford moment is beyond the pictorial; it is hardly an image at all. The stain of paint repre sents the "very place where figuration abolishes itself," and yet, as Didi-Huberman suggests, it also simultaneously "generates itself' by asserting its visibility and blurring the boundaries between the depicted and the real.29 Compared to the subtle material integration of the print in his book, Sche del's other manipulations of the woodcut are much more obvious, although their meanings are not immediately apparent. Along one edge of the front and back, he inscribed lines of pagan Latin verse, including a passage by the first-century Roman poet Persius (Figs. 5 and 6).30 These obscure texts serve as an anachronistic gloss that harmonizes the pious Christian image with the more worldly knowledge of Schedel's humanist education. Through this text and image combination, Sche del draws a sophisticated correlation between the "two-headed Parnassus"—the twin-peaked mountain associated with Apollo, Dionysus, and the Muses—and the double-lobed Sacred Heart. Further, the side wound is compared to the "Caballine fountain" or "fountain of Pegasus," the mythic spring of inspiration. Thus seem ingly random marginal notes prove to be an interpretive act through which Schedel constructs an unexpected analogy, one suggesting that true inspiration is found in the landscape of Christ's heart and through sipping at the fountain of his wound. More familiar are the texts written at the top and bottom of the print's reverse: the Latin prayers Deus qui nobis and Salve sancta facies (Fig. 6).31 Associated with the Veronica veil or sudarium, the cloth believed to be marked with the image of Christ's face, these prayers are often accompanied by depictions of the relic; but here they frame the image of the wound created by the slit and the stain. For Sche del, the bloody opening was clearly a substitute for Christ's body: a fragmentary and indirect vision consistent with the Deus qui nobis prayer, which asks for the ability to venerate the sudarium "as through a glass darkly" in hopes of eventu ally seeing Christ "face to face." The language derives from 1 Corinthians 13:12, which concludes, "Now I know in part, but then I shall know even as I am known." Ultimately, the addition of these prayers reveals a chain of devotional responses inspired by the evocative form of the red stain, which may have reminded Sche del of the darkened, stained appearance of the sudarium itself. The stain's overall shape resembles the simple silhouette depicted in various copies of the relic. Fur thermore, Schedel may have actually clarified what he saw in the puddle of paint through a visual addition that is now lost. Close examination suggests that a small rectangular replica of the Veronica veil was once pasted over the stain.32 Whether in an illuminated book of hours or in the form of a single-sheet print, the depiction of the side wound allowed for a dynamic viewing process, one that can be partly reconstructed through careful attention to the image's material and formal features. Such an image inspired not only visual study but also creative interpretation and interaction.

Areford primarily a matter of solitary viewing, an essentially one-on-one experience char acterized by close proximity and physical intimacy. Instead of a passive presence gazing from a distance, we must imagine a viewer more fully engaged, not unlike the conception of the reader proposed by Roland Barthes: a reader in "collabora tion," involved in "playing" the text, who must "produce the text, open it out, set it going."31 As a potential instrument of meditation, prayer, protection, and reward, the image needed the viewer as much as the viewer needed the image. Indeed, the image was completely dependent; not only did it need to be looked at and imagi natively transformed but also touched, pressed, kissed, folded, inscribed, and even prodded into being.
