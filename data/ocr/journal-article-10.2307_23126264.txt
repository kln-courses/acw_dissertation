<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLES H. HINNANT Schiller and the Political Sublime: Two Perspectives In a lath essay, "Postscript to Terror and the Sublime," Jean Frangois Lyotard declared that "as for a politics of the sublime, there is no such thing. It could only be terror. But there is an aesthetics of the sublime in politics."1 Lyotard's confidence in his ability to distinguish the sublime from terror, aesthetics from politics, is a trait that he shares with post-Longinian theorists of the aesthetic ideology of sublimity. Edmund Burke showed no hesitation in arguing not only that the sublime is governed above all by the emotion of terror but also that terror becomes sublime only "when it does not press too close."2 Friedrich Schiller likewise emphasized that "the sublime object must, of course, be frightening, but it may not incite actual fear."3 What is striking about these observations is that they take for granted the fact that sublime pleasure is ori ented toward unpleasant, dangerous, even death-dealing experiences. Nothing sets terror apart from the sublime, it seems, except the simple fact that a sense of material security keeps it at a manageable distance. This is where the diffi culty begins: have the implications of the passage from politics to aesthetics, from terror to the sublime received adequate scrutiny? Instead of seeing the sublime experience as an indirect result of our reflection upon our personal safety, might we not do better to ask what objects have to be altered, modified, or withdrawn in order for the imagination to be able to recuperate a sense of its own power, to be able to take delight in phenomena that it might otherwise find too threatening? Does the experience of the sublime involve some kind of necessary political censorship? Or are there different possible solutions to the dangers posed to the imagination by phenomena it finds itself incapable of controlling? This is a matter which, all in all, has received little commentary. By examining the different ways in which the sublime has been constructed we can come to a fuller understanding of the political unconscious of the aes thetics of terror—what has to be suppressed in order for us to achieve active mastery over it rather than allowing ourselves to be passively overcome by it.

Hinnant In a pair of essays, "On the Sublime: Toward the Further Development of Some Kantian Ideas" (1793) and "On the Sublime" (1801, composed between 1794 and 1796), Schiller is one theorist who worked out strikingly different approaches to the paradox of pleasure and pain. Separated by his shift from an admiring to a critical attitude toward the French Revolution after the Reign of Terror, these essays provide ideal test cases for a study of the political issues posed by the relation between terror and the sublime. In the past twenty years, as their interest in aesthetics has increased, philosophers and literary critics have focused on the sublime in order to recast their broader understanding of the relationships among art, literature, and history.4 The two essays by Schiller can provide an ideal site for this kind of investigation because in them the dif ferent political compromises, adjustments, and suppressions that are possible if the sublime is to maintain its distance from terror are especially evident. Both essays take as their point of departure Kant's hypothesis concerning the sublime in The Critique of Judgment (1790). Contending that the sublime is an "outrage" to the imagination, overwhelming it, Kant distinguishes be tween a "mathematically" and a "dynamically" sublime, according to whether the imagination is related to "the faculty of cognition or to that of desire."5 The mathematically sublime is that which is "absolutely great" or that "in comparison with which all else is small" (Kant, 94, 97). The dynamically sublime is experi enced when we recognize our helplessness, for example, before the terrible physical power of nature but, nonetheless, "discover within us a power of re sistance of quite another kind" (111). It goes without saying that the dynami cally sublime can no longer be equated merely with our sense of physical safety. The reason is simple, and it points out the originality of Kant's reason ing. It is this: before Kant, the term sublime had designated a terror that was carefully bounded by a real material security; this stops being the case as soon as the sublime object is conceived as an overwhelming external force and, in addition, once a place is set aside for a separate power of resistance.6 Schiller acknowledges this power when he takes up Kant's distinction in the earlier essay, where he renames Kant's categories the theoretically and practically-sublime. According to Schiller, an object is theoretically-sublime insofar as it brings with it the no tion [Vorstellung] of infinity, something the imagination does not feel capable of depicting. An object is practically-sublime insofar as it brings with it the notion of danger we do not feel ourselves capable of overcoming with our physical powers. We succumb in the attempt to grasp the idea [Vorstellung] of the theoretically-sublime or to resist the force of the practically-sublime. A peaceful ocean is an example of the former, a stormy ocean an example of the latter. (24-25) Of the two categories, Schiller is only interested in the practically-sublime. Like Kant, he insists that the essence of this category resides in our awareness</page><page sequence="3">Schiller and the Sublime 123 of our resistance in the face of danger, going on to pose the issue in terms of two possibilities: "either the fearful object may not direct its power at us at all, or, if this happens, then our spirit must remain free, while our sensuous nature is overwhelmed" (29). Inasmuch as Schiller believes that the latter possibility is extremely "rare," he argues that we are concerned only with the first case where we are able, of course, to witness the might of the frightful object but without it being directed at us, in other words, where we know that we are safe from that very object. It is only in the imagination, then, that we put ourselves in a position where this power could affect us and all resis tance would be in vam. (30) Hence it is not sufficient, Schiller believes, to argue that the sublime is embod ied in the distance between the "frightful object" and the material security that permits us to believe that we are "safe" from that object. On the contrary, the terrifying object must exist for us even if "only in the imagination." What we behold is only a "representation" (Vorstellung), yet if this representation is "vivid enough," it will set "the preservation instinct in motion and the result" will be "something analogous to what the actual sensation would produce" (30). On this double movement rests, not so much a distinct experience in its own right, as the repetition, in a different key, of the primary feeling of actual fear. For Schiller, even this feeling—which is assumed to be a central element of the sublime experience—is far from simple. According to Schiller, fear has two connotations: it is the anticipation of the pain that might befall one for whatever reason, whether it be through a natural catastrophe or human ac tion—and the feeling of disquiet aroused by instances of misfortune and dan ger which one can never anticipate and from which one can never know one is safe. "The concept of safety," argues Schiller, "cannot be restricted to the fact that someone knows he is physically out of danger." Indeed, "would anyone," he asks, "be willing to base his security in the face of fate, the omnipresent power of the divinity, painful diseases, poignant losses, or death?" (30) To overcome the danger posed to the psyche by these intractable realities, Schiller introduces a distinction between a security that is external and physical and one that is inner and moral. At first glance, the difference might appear to be minimal, but Schiller contends that the sense of well-being that arises when one contemplates a stormy sea from the safety of the shore can never by itself become a source of the sublime. "This sense of security satisfies the instinct for self-preservation," Schiller concedes but adds that "the sublime is never based upon the satisfaction of our instincts" (33). Schiller also holds that if death is going to remain sublime, it cannot be permitted to lose its terror. This</page><page sequence="4">124 Charles H. Hinnant means that "the very idea of immortality . . . can contribute nothing at all to the representation of death as a sublime object" (32). What is notable about this formulation is its precision: the martyr or fanatic is not conceived as a sublime figure; a sacrificial death lacks the inner tension of a confrontation in which one seeks not to negate adversity but to struggle against it. The problem that confronts Schiller arises from the absence of a vocabu lary adequate to respect the conflicting claims involved in the construction of the sublime. The object of the sublime "must be frightening to the sensuous side of our nature; an evil must threaten our physical condition and the repre sentation of the danger must set our self-preservation instinct in motion" (34). At the same time, however, "our intelligible self, namely, that within that is not of nature, must distinguish itself from the sensuous side of our being and be come aware of its self-sufficiency, of its independence from everything that can affect its physical nature. In short, it must become conscious of its freedom" (34). It is the linking of these two incompatible strands that generates the sym metrical, reversible chiastic pattern that Paul de Man describes in his essay on Schiller and Kant. De Man describes the way the chiasm operates in Schiller's argument in the following terms: "If Reason can take on the attribute of Terror, then Nature will be able to take on the attribute of tranquility, and you will be able to enjoy tranquilly, with a certain tranquillity, the sublime violence of Nature."9 Schiller thus distinguishes between the figure who successfully re sists the terrifying object and the figure who succumbs to it yet still preserves his dignity: someone who overcomes what is fearful is magnificent [gro(3]; some one who, even while succumbing to the fearful, does not fear it is sublime lerhaben]. Hannibal was magnificent from a theoretical point of view, since he forged a passage over the untrodden Alps to Italy. He was mag nificent in a practical sense, or sublime, only in misfortune. Hercules was magnificent because he undertook and completed his twelve tasks. Prometheus was sublime because, fettered to the Caucasus, he did not regret his deed and did not acknowledge having done anything wrong. An individual can display magnificence in good fortune, sub limity only in misfortune. (35) But Schiller's explanation also implies the constitution of a specific dra matic scenario in which the experience characterized as sublime is observed. We are made aware of the sublime figure, even in defeat, as an object of plea surable scrutiny by a third party. The representation is thus theatrical in nature and yields a rudimentary typology of heroic and tragic protagonists. Within</page><page sequence="5">Schiller and the Sublime 125 the space of this typology, which objectifies and universalizes the sublime ex perience, there is a discontinuity between the first-person spectator and the third-person protagonist. No doubt it is Schiller's distrust of the security that is a function of purely physical causes that leads him to shift in focus from the observer to the central character of the drama. But such a shift locks the protagonist into the same predicament as the one it seeks to overcome: the preternatural security of the person whose spirit remains free while his or her creaturely nature is overwhelmed. Schiller has already declared that such a person is "extremely rare and demands an elevation of human nature that can scarcely be considered possible in an individual" (29). Schiller seeks to over come this obstacle by dividing the sublime moment into three parts: "(1) an objective, physical power, (2) our subjective, physical impotence, and (3) our subjective, moral superiority" (36). In Schiller's argument, it is the linear suc cession of these three images in our minds that constitutes the sublime experi ence. The sublime (as distinct from the merely pleasurable) is not primarily a matter of reflection and comparison. Rather, it is an informed judgment of a particular kind. According to Schiller, "it is left to the individual making the judgment to produce the image of the suffering in himself and transform that subject matter into an object (Objekt) of fear by virtue of its relation to the preservation instinct and into something sublime by virtue of its relation to the moral person in him" (36). Yet the individual making the judgment either plays a part in the sublime spectacle, or is a spectator; either one merely sees, or one sees oneself, by pre senting oneself confronting the danger in the objectivity of the Vorstellung. Schiller is apparently unconcerned with this distinction; what matters to him is what assists the individual in transforming the "subject matter" of the sub lime into an object of fear. Clearly, the sublime supposes comprehension of some kind of awesome, destructive power. The contentious issue is whether "the kinds of subject matter that show us nothing more than a power of nature far superior to our own" and are sufficient to relate that power to "our physical state or to our moral character as persons, are sublime solely in a contempla tive sense" (36). The difficulty arises "because not everyone has sufficient imagination to produce in themselves a vivid image of the danger, nor do they all have enough moral self-sufficiency and fortitude not to try to avoid such an image" (37). Any sublime object is split at the outset by the uncertainty— unresolved—of knowing what can be evoked by a contemplation of it. Of cer tain images there can be no doubt: an abyss appearing at our feet, a thunderstorm, a flaming volcano, a mass of rock looming over us as though it were about to plunge down on us, a storm at sea, a bitter winter in the polar regions, a summer in the tropics, ferocious or poisonous animals, a flood—all these and</page><page sequence="6">lib Charles H. Hinnant more are the sorts 01 natural forces in the face of which our capacity to resist counts for nothing, natural forces that contradict our physi cal existence. (37) Other subject matters taken trom nature are, however, "neutral" and can only be "subjectively transformed by the intervention of fantasy into frightful pow ers, and fantasy does not merely discover what is frightful through comparison, but rather creates it quite arbitrarily without an adequate, objective basis for it" (38). When this happens, the spectator at once realizes and dematerializes his fear, making it true but only on an illusory level. The problem obviously is that this still does not establish what it is that evokes the shudder—whether through comparison or an imaginative process that resists the test of reality. The sublime begins precisely at the moment we stop worrying whether the fearful object is actual or imaginary and reflect in stead on whether it is sufficiently threatening to pose a danger to us. The prob lem is not for people experiencing terror to decide whether the object of their tremor is real or illusory. The problem they confront is whether it is imagina tively powerful enough to frighten them. The difficulty has nothing to do with the more or less actual basis of the fear; it has to do with the terrified subject's imagination of disaster. In order to recover the source ot this phantasmatic terror in all its purity and intensity, Schiller finds it necessary to resort to a fable of origins: tor humanity in its infancy, where the imagination works in the most unencumbered way, everything unusual is terrifying. In each unex pected appearance of nature people believe they see an enemy, an jnemy armed against their existence. At the same time the preserva tion instinct is at work meeting this attack. In this period the preser vation instinct is their unbridled master and, since this instinct is anxious and cowardly, its domination is a realm of terror and fear. 38) what matters in this subjective version ot the omnium helium contra omnes is appearance not reality. Such a version acknowledges no discrepancy between the fictive and the real because its terror has become so intense that it has freed itself from the claim to the actuality that gives depth but also ambiguity to fearful objects. But behind this fable of humanity in its infancy something else makes itself felt, the revelation of the hidden truth of the sublime: that the archaic threat is posed less by natural phenomena than by other human be ings. This threat thus has a political character. Terror is the passion that drives tiuman beings to posit the Other and to achieve security through this Other— not by suppressing or fleeing it but by seeking to anticipate it. As Schiller viv idly describes the effects of this passion:</page><page sequence="7">Schiller and the Sublime 127 one finds people who arm themselves before they dress, and they grab first for the sword when meeting a stranger. The custom of the ancient Taureans, to sacrifice to Diana every newcomer who had the misfortune to land on their coast, scarcely had any other origin than fear. For only a human being formed in a depraved way and not some one merely unformed is so barbaric that he rages against what can do him no harm. (38) In one sense, the danger posed by the Other is revealed as the impetus behind "the rise of culture." But this impetus oscillates between two poles. On the one hand, terror has positive value as a political incentive. The defense against terror, the terror of the Other, is the true upward movement of human ity, and the "people" are the driving force behind this movement. Here one salutes the submission of the terrified populace to the juridical rule of the so cial contract that subordinates individual liberties to the well-being of the community. On the other hand, terror has a negative value in its promotion of preemptive violence against others: strangers, enemies, or whoever must be sacrificed to insure our safety. Schiller's ideas contain the germ of what is de veloped in philosophical rather than historical terms by Emmanuel Levinas when he describes the habitual mode of Western philosophical discourse as a "horror" of the Other that remains other.8 In Schiller's historicist explanation, the custom of the Taureans suggests what is also suggested by Diana's dual role as goddess of the moon and the hunt; namely, the predatory nature of a state of pure unbounded imagination unchecked by reason and judgment. In this childlike state, the fear aroused by the Other has to be acted out; no sooner do we represent the Other to ourselves than we experience terror; hence the instantaneous punishment that we mete out to newcomers even as we fear a similar fate for ourselves. In that moment the Other will doubtless be scarcely any different from ourselves, the terrorizer from the terrorized, but this Other will already be an enemy. Although an increasing anthropological interest in early peoples may have provided the impetus for it, Schiller's fable of humanity in its infancy is most importantly a desire to project onto the past what it denies in the present. The rediscovery of the Other suggests how for Schiller early history becomes the disclosure of a genealogical link between the sublime and terror ignored by a tradition that seeks to segregate aesthetic appearances from political actuali ties. It is to earlier theorists of the aesthetic ideology of terror that one might turn for an understanding of how this process of segregation came about. John Dennis includes in a seminal early list of objects that inspire terror not only "Thunder, Tempests, raging Seas, Inundations, Torrents," and "Earthquakes" but also "Spirits and Souls of Men," "Fire," and "War."9 In An Essay on the Sub lime (1747), John Baillie argues that if "we suppose an Alexander laying level</page><page sequence="8">128 Charles H. Hinnant towns, depopulating countries, and ravaging the whole world, how does the sublime rise, nay though mankind be the sacrifice to the tradition."10 By the time of Burke, however, the aesthetics of sublimity was coming to be domi nated by natural phenomena—hurricanes, volcanoes, mountains, stormy seas, etc.11 Nonetheless, Burke inaugurates his analysis of the sublime in the Philo sophical Enquiry into the Origins of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful (1757) with an example of state terror, the gruesome torture and execution of Robert Damiens, the would-be assassin of Louis XV (39).12 According to Burke, "the power which arises from institution in kings and commanders has the same connection with terror" as natural power. "Sovereigns are frequently addressed with the title of dread majesty" (67).13 An even more diminished concern informs Kant's "Analytic of the Sublime" where it is asserted that "aes thetic judgment" prefers the "general" to the "statesman" as an object of rever ence and that "war itself, provided it is conducted with order and a sacred respect for the rights of civilians, has something sublime about it" (Kant, 112, 113). Here the political is distinguished from the natural sublime by a series of qualifications that emphasizes the gulf between a war in which civilians are comfortably insulated from any cruelty and such catastrophes as "volcanoes in all their violence of destruction, hurricanes leaving desolation in their track," and "the boundless ocean rising with rebellious force" (Kant, 112). The ex plicit anthropomorphism of Kant's description only adds to the impression of a violence that has been displaced from the political to the natural realm. Schiller carries this disjunction even further, for his interpretation of terror in terms of a vanished era of human savagery assumes that fear of the Other is the key to the subject's relation to external reality and that aesthetic pleasure begins at the point where this fear begins to disappear. Yet it is clear that beyond the darkened past, Schiller continues to imagine some kind of survival of the primitive world we have left behind. In Schiller's evolutionary model, the archaic actors of social conflict have left the scene, thus making possible the transmutation of fear into what he identifies as a sub division of the practically-sublime, the "contemplative sublime." Yet even though our primeval fear of the Other has disappeared "with the rise of cul ture," a "trace" of it remains in "the contemplation of nature where people give themselves up to the play of fantasy" (38). The term "trace" here means for Schiller what it means for Levinas—it is the specific manner by which the Other signifies. Within Schiller's aesthetics of play, the "trace" of the absent Other continues to haunt the cultured observer in the silences and empty spaces it has left behind. Schiller shows a quite significant reluctance to grant these familiar props of the natural sublime the status of frightful objects: a profound quiet, an immense emptiness, a sudden light in the dark are in the themselves quite neutral things, distinguished by nothing</page><page sequence="9">Schiller and the Sublime 129 but their extraordinariness and unusualness. Nevertheless, they arouse a feeling of fright, or at least, intensify its impression, and for that reason are suited to be something sublime. (38) I his is not merely an inventory of special eilects to be appropriated by novel ists, dramatists, and painters as they see fit. Not the magnitude and indetermi nacy of the sublime in place of the littleness of reason and beauty; not the mysterious as a source of power in its own right; but, on the contrary, the mys terious as an index of "the idea of helplessness" (39), the atavistic terror that continues to link us to our primeval ancestors. Disarmed of our weapons, we are compelled to rely upon our senses, but "the sense of sight, the primary sentry of existence, fails us in darkness and we find ourselves defenselessly exposed to the hidden danger" (39, 40). Yet the emptiness of the scene pre vents the contemplative sublime from coinciding with itself. It compels the cultured spectator to live in the space of a discontinuity between fact and fan tasy, between the empty iconic sign and the tremor it evokes but can never truly justify. Schiller's contemplative sublime, therefore, is one manifestation of a ten dency to make natural phenomena the primary, if not exclusive, focus of the aesthetics of terror. His revision of the status of early peoples results from the optimistic assumption that the rise of culture is a progressive movement in which a realm of terror has been replaced by a reign of peace. Consequently, the sublime is now presented as occupying an "empty space," somewhat like a Gothic mansion that, while abandoned, is still haunted by the spectral pres ence of its ghostly ancestors.14 The sublime is perceived through the incidence of menace at the moment when the danger is no longer posed by the antici pated presence of the Other but by the excessive violence of the frisson itself. This is not to imply that Schiller's contemplative sublime is nostalgic, mourn ing the past because it has disappeared. Its emotion is pleasurable simply be :ause the objects that occasion it have all but vanished, leaving only a trace of their former existence. In keeping with the symbolic environment of an empty landscape, Schiller's sublime seems deprived of nearly all bodily substance, ca pable of frightening only the timorous and the weak. Modem theorists of the sublime such as Slovoj Zizek agree with Schiller in pointing to the fallacy of :onfusing the contemplative sublime with the object it projects. In his Lacan lan reinterpretation of the Hegelian dialectic, Zizek insists that "there is nothing intrinsically sublime in a sublime object."15 Perhaps the best instance of a con temporary work that presents an argument similar to that of Schiller is Arthur Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Idea (1819), where "a very lonely place, with unbroken horizon under a cloudless sky, trees and plants in the perfectly motionless air, no animals, no men, no running water, the deepest silence" is</page><page sequence="10">1JU Charles H. Hinnant described as an example ot the sublime in a low degree. 16 Yet the exposure of the contemplative sublime as a phantasm reveals something tenuous and self-deceptive in its illusion of danger. From the moment we enter into its si lent, tenebrous world, we are haunted by an awareness of falsity as well as fear, by a recognition that once we cross the barrier of fantasy that keeps it safe, we endanger its very existence. The contemplative sublime poses another difficulty: inasmuch as its plea sure is achieved through the disappearance of the Other, it is not a pleasure that can readily accommodate the coexistence of actual, flesh and blood peo ple. What is dark, silent, and full of mystery may evoke an archaic shudder, but there is nothing in it that can engage us in the lives and suffering of our fellow human beings. To overcome this limitation, Schiller introduces another subdivision of the practically-sublime, "the pathetically sublime." In this cate gory, "something is presented to us in an objective way, not merely as a power in general, but at the same time as a power having catastrophic consequences for people—in other words it does not merely show, but actually expresses its power in a hostile manner" (41). In the pathetically sublime, the "people" are not presented as Other but rather as like ourselves, so that they do not pose a threat and for that reason can become objects of sympathetic identification. Yet the cause of their suffering must be clearly marked as an "illusion" or "fab rication," or, in case it actually exists, must be presented "not immediately to the senses, but to the imagination" (42). The insistence upon illusion must be seen in the context of the objection of anti-theatrical critics like Charles de St. Evremond, who contended that tragedy transformed the theater into "a school of terror and pity, where people only learned to be affrighted at all dangers, and to abandon themselves to despair at every misfortune."17 We must see Schiller's pathetically sublime as a defense against the demoralization implicit in St. Evremond's criticism. The lucid observer who distinguishes what is imi tated from what is imitating still identifies or empathizes with the sufferer, yet the identification must not be "pressed to the point where one is actually suf fering oneself. Even in the most violent emotion we must distinguish ourselves from the individual who himself suffers" (42). This is a matter of intensity: when the emotion becomes too violent, the identification becomes too violent, as it were, and not compassionate enough. In this sense, the pathos that Schil ler evokes takes place against the background of a dissociation of suffering from fear. In place of terror, he substitutes empathy and compassion and it is this substitution that makes our "consciousness of our moral freedom" possi ble—the freedom that enables us to feel that we are "removed from the causal ity of this suffering" (43). Thus the pathetically sublime, fully as much as the contemplative sub ime, involves a disavowal of the Other. If imaginative identification and pa :hos are what orient our response to the pain and misfortunes of others, it</page><page sequence="11">Schiller and the Sublime 131 follows that our tear, disgust, and horror of the Other must be suppressed. In "The Art of Tragedy," Schiller contends that "our compassion is no less weak ened if our souls are filled with revulsion at the perpetrators of some calamity, when we should be pitying the victims of it" (8). It goes without saying that Schiller here grants an absolute privilege to compassion. Doubtless, he ac knowledges the traditional interdependence of pity and fear in tragedy. But, in fact, fear is always diminished: "our sympathy ascends to a much higher level when both the person suffering and the person causing the suffering become objects of sympathy" (8). The fact that pathos acquires sovereignty over the aesthetic world allows the empathic spectator's awareness of the causes of an guish to become a constitutive rather than a blocking element in tragedy and leads to a reduction of the Other to the Same. 1 here is no reason to suppose that Schiller was not keenly aware of the difficulties posed by this disavowal of the Other, for he submits the terms of his theory to a thoroughgoing revision in the 1801 essay, "Of the Sublime." In this essay, Schiller attempts to reconnect the sublime to the real world by associating a feeling of terror with the danger aroused by a confrontation with the Other, a danger engendered by history as well as by natural phenomena. Schiller's rejection of the revolutionary politics he admired before the Reign of Terror may also have played a role in this revision. In the later essay, the sublime is no longer inspired by our atavistic shud ders in a darkened and empty space or by our identification with the sufferings of others but rather by an active resistance to what he now calls "brute force," the immediate viofence that orients all power at its origin. This resistance is plainly anti-Revolutionary in intention, inverting the pacific sentiments of the pathetically sublime into an oblique criticism of those who refused to fight back during the Terror. Thus Schiller argues that "nothing is so beneath the dignity of a human being as to suffer viofence, for it destroys the individual's humanity. Whoever inflicts it on us, is at odds with nothing less than our hu manity; whoever cowardly suffers it, tosses his humanity aside" (70). Overtly, then, the goal of Schiller's argument is the frank affirmation of a self that re fuses to give in where its own preservation is concerned. This resistance can Dccur in two ways: "realistically, when the human being opposes brute force with brute force" and "idealistically, when he takes a step beyond nature and thereby negates the concept of brute force with regard to himself" (71). By implication, the realist who meets force with force without vexation or anxiety is the one who fails to experience the sublime. It follows that in order for our response to brute force to be characterized as sublime, it still has to be 'mixed": "it is a combination of being in anguish (at its peak this expresses itself is a shudder) and being happy (something that can escalate to a kind of ec stasy" (74). In its insistence on the coexistence of these two "contradictory"</page><page sequence="12">132 Charles H. Hinnant responses, Schiller's argument has affinities with Schopenhauer's description of the "undismayed beholder" who perceives himself, on the one hand, as an individual . . . which the slightest touch of these forces can utterly destroy, helpless against powerful nature, ... a vanishing nothing in the presence of stupen dous might; and, on the other hand, as the eternal, peaceful, knowing subject. (132)18 Schiller likewise insists the sublime moment will continue to be a moment of defeat: "we relate [the sublime object] to our powers of living and regard it as a might against which our own might amounts to nothing" (74). Yet because the sublime is arrayed against brute force, the language of pa thos and idealism is played off against the harsher realities of existence, surface against depth, in order to generate in the mind of the spectator a reassessment of the "sublime object." This reassessment leads to a heightening of the con trast between an illusory ideal and a destructive reality. Schiller speaks of the sublime as the kind of experience that draws the individual away from the "sensuous world" and all its beauty: "not gradually (since there is no transition from dependency to freedom), but only suddenly, and through a kind of shock, does something sublime tear the individual spirit loose from the net a sophisticated sensuousness uses to ensare it" (77). But the encounter of surface and depth can only be a destructive one, even though it is necessary to the freedom of spirit that is an integral aspect of the sublime. Because the structure of illusion is analyzed exclusively in terms of beauty, illusion (whether playful or pathological) is now perceived as a barrier to genuine freedom. Schiller thus leaves us no alternative but to acknowledge "world history" as an appropriate subject of the sublime. What this means is that we must do "away . . . with the coddling that is based on a false understanding and with the frail, pam pered taste that throws a veil over the stern face of necessity" (83). This proc ess of unveiling has an inescapable logic: "there is salvation for us, not in ignorance of the dangers camped around us—for ultimately this ignorance must come to an end—but only in the acquaintance with these dangers" (83). Since we can never know when these dangers might arise, it follows that we must prepare ourselves ahead of time by searching through the historical record for instances of tragic misfortune. History supplies "ample examples of the pathetic picture of humanity wrestling with fate, a picture of the incessant flight of fortune, of confidence betrayed, injustice triumphant, and innocence violated. Imitating these images, the art of tragedy places them before our eyes" (83). These images are used by Schiller to reconstitute the truth of the sublime, the truth of its terrifying political actuality. But our acquaintance with this actuality will not enable us to envision an intelligent principle above the</page><page sequence="13">Schiller and the Sublime 133 world of change. The movement of history will always remain no more than the unending cycle of creation and destruction, oppressing the mind with a core of mutability that cannot be absorbed into a higher vision and thus anes thetized. Adhering to his earlier distinction between being anxious and being happy Schiller suggests that the spectator of world history is at once a knower and a sufferer, "shivering in wonder at necessity's stern law" (83). Hayden White has recognized the significance of this argument, contend ing that Schiller countered "the progressive demotion of the sublime in favor of the beautiful" and the tendency to concentrate solely on "the imagination's response to natural phenomena." In opposition to these trends, writes White, Schiller "joined the notion of the historical sublime to the kind of response that would authorize a totally different politics."19 Two essential traits define this new historical sublime and oppose it to the historical model of the earlier essay. First, history is no longer a matter of the rise of culture, of the progress of humanity from natural anarchy to the peaceable kingdom. Schiller's new vision of world history is remarkable for the complete absence of the two-stage hypothesis so prominent in the first essay. Second, the historical sublime is linked to a theater of 'victimization' in which the threat posed by the Other is no longer imaginary but real. Since the threat is always unexpected, there is no room for the kind of anticipatory violence that characterized the politics of archaic man in the first essay; people are posited from the outset as reacting rather than acting, not initiating but responding to events over which they have little control. History occurs by reason of an implacable Necessity that takes the form of a reign of injustice. History institutes an iron law, by linking the spectacle of injustice, as the lot of those who have been mistreated, to the blind cycle of fortune and mutability. This very precise vision of world history can be seen in Schiller's evoca tion of "the stubborn yet futile struggle of Mithridates" and in the spectacular destruction of the cities of Syracuse and Carthage (83).20 Such episodes never stop repeating themselves. Schiller's sublime history is presented in the form of a retrospective prophecy: particular examples are reinterpreted in a way that transforms them into a prophecy of the historical destiny of people in general. The designation of the sublime as a realm of personal power and dignity is now opposed to a vision of history as a spectacle of crises, duplicities, errors, and terrorisms; a vision which, accordingly, defines a sphere of absolute free dom that can acknowledge pain yet assert its mastery over the deeply indiffer ent energy of the historical process. That resistance to actual misfortune must become the ultimate goal of an aesthetic education is what, for Schiller, now characterizes the sublime and the requirement of independence proper to it. In order to prepare us for the possibility of great suffering, the tragic theater must cull exemplary lives from the classical past, so that "the self-sufficient</page><page sequence="14">134 Charles H. Hinnant principle in our minds gets room to assert its independence" (82). Such a the ater works on the assumption that the more often the mind renews this act of independence, the more accomplished the human spirit becomes and it acquires an ever greater advantage over sensu ous urges, such that when a serious misfortune finally does arise in the midst of these imagined and artificial ones, that person is in a po sition to treat it as an artificial one and transform actual suffering into a sublime emotion. (82-83) Such spectacles cannot be recollected in tranquillity but must be repeated; not recounted but staged in the present, dramatized in symptomatic actions. They will not be efficacious when they are replayed in the mind; instead they must be represented directly in front of the beholder. In short, Schiller's aesthetic education insists upon the multiplication of these artificial spectacles that in still a sense of independence in us; it holds to these demonstration devices that are at once eye-opening shockers and "an inoculation against unavoidable fate, robbing fate of its perniciousness and diverting its attack to a human being's strength" (83). The term "inoculation" is an analogue for an act of tragic representation that points to a knowledge deeper than the "trace" of an archaic terror without actually immersing us in the destructive element inherent in world history. One can see the difference between this art and one that reshapes external re ality by projecting its own imaginary terrors onto it. The new conception of art is committed to the inevitability of suffering rather than the assurance of happiness. It seeks to induce the "kind of philosophical calm" that, as Eugene Delacroix writes in his journal, "prepares us for suffering and raises us above mere nothings."21 Not to become aware of the reality of injustice, not to know the dangers lurking around us is to leave ourselves vulnerable to the dark core of destruction concealed within the world of sensuous beauty. Yet an unmedi ated knowledge of brute force will inevitably prove inimical to the independent spirit. All this enables us to see something positive in tragic representations and to assume that they can achieve a domestication of the alien, however terrifying that may appear to anyone who lacks their historical perspective. Thus Schiller's reformulation of the sublime is related to changing atti tudes to politics and history. Where he initially sought to discover the sublime in our response to an imagined or absent object, he now recognizes that it must involve us in an encounter with "the murky anarchy of the moral world" (79). Given his adoption of such an aggressive stance, his problem is to imag ine the possibility of an engagement with actuality that will not emasculate the exaltation of the sublime emotion, reducing it to the abject impotence of pure</page><page sequence="15">Schiller and the Sublime 135 terror. It is for this reason that he has recourse to a tragic theater in which the spectator sees the anarchy of history in a representation, and through the mediating eyes of surrogate figures like "Cato, Aristides, Phocion, and similar men" (81). In art, this could lead to an expansion of the sublime to include not only the exhilarating terror inspired by rushing torrents, waterfalls, precip itous crags, and unattainable mountain peaks in landscape paintings, but also the new genre of contemporary history painting in which the spectator's sym pathy is directed not to the power and glory of the victors but to the plight and the heroic dignity of the victims. Goya's The Third of May, 1808 (1814), Gericault's The Raft of the 'Medusa' (1819), and Delacroix's The Massacres of Chios (1824), are three examples of this new genre of the political sublime that come immediately to mind.22 For Schiller, the depiction of these exemplary scenes would serve the function of a practice run, permitting us to become aware of the actualities of history through a protective but transparent barrier. As spectators, we remain outside the representation, even as we identify with the surrogate figures for the purpose of gaining an aesthetic education. The appeal of such an educational program is twofold: intellectual and emotional. On the one hand, its tragic plots provide a lucid demonstration of vicissitudes of history, a primer of the dangers confronting heroic figures that corresponds to what might happen to us in the immediate present or future. On the other hand, these struggling figures could inspire in us "a painful feeling of our limi tations" or, more dramatically, the sublime courage associated with the nobil ity and endurance of those who remain steadfast in defeat.23 What also seems apparent to me, however, is that Schiller's two essays are a standing rebuke to those of us who regard the sublime as a viable living cate gory but continue to treat it, as Andrew Wilton notes, "in an archaeological spirit," as if it belonged to an outmoded historical episteme.M They are a mock ing reminder of the contradiction inherent in our attempt to view the aesthet ics of terror as a normative center of value at the same time that we refuse to regard it as a genuine theoretical issue. To examine Schiller's essays is to fur nish ourselves with the salutary but necessary reminder that the sublime rep resents a daunting challenge to any one who would like to preserve it as a meaningful literary and aesthetic category. These essays were composed in an era in which such terms as art, beauty taste, imagination, aesthetics, and the sublime were still regarded as part of an ongoing and unfinished theoretical project. Can we approach the problematic relation between terror and the sub lime with the same degree of urgency and rigor that Schiller brought to the subject? The contrasting solutions of his two essays provide an example of how that process might begin. University of Missouri-Columbia</page><page sequence="16">136 Charles H. Hinnant Notes 1.

In an analysis of the sublime in Thomson's Seasons, Tim Fulford shows how Thomson represents a landscape "in which not only is danger suffered by rustics rather than the gentry, but power and violence are contained within a larger structure of order." The "ter rifying scenes," he concludes, "remain set pieces that do not endanger the overall authority of the surveying narrator and reader."

Alan Liu describes the picturesque as "arrested violence." See William Wordsworth: The Sense of History (Stanford: Stanford Univer sity Press, 1989), 63-68. 12. Burke claims, incredibly, that he is convinced that "we have a degree of delight, and that no small one, in the real misfortunes and pains of others" (45). Burke's ideas may contain the germ of what has sometimes been called the 'negative' sub lime, the sublime of the terrorist, torturer, or world conqueror. On this version of the sublime and its relation to the holocaust, see Dominick La Capra, In the Shadow of the Holocaust: History and Memory after Auschwitz (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), 3n3, 38. 13. Since early modern governments lacked most of the coercive powers of a modern state, princes and ministers had to rely on the spectacle of state executions to com pel the obedience of ordinary people and to maintain public order. One can argue that it is Burke's loss of faith in the efficacy of these spectacles after the Revolution that led him to shift in his meditation on Marie Antoinette in the Reflections from an aesthetics of sublimity to an aesthetics of beauty, of spectacle, of ceremony, to a politics of reverence rather than fear. Richard Payne Knight observes that "the execution of a state criminal of high rank, or indeed of any rank, has of late years been a rare event; and one, which very few persons now living have ever wit nessed" (An Analytical Inquiry into the Principles of Taste [London: Payne, 1805], 315). 14.

It is of course possible to define the sublime more broadly than Kant, Schiller, or Schelling did. Barton Thurber describes the late eighteenth-century sublime as being "associated with dramatic mountain scenery, political rebellion, madness, witchcraft and demonol ogy, . . . and above all with the anti-social, even inhuman voices of mayhem, rebel lion, and political as well as rhetorical insurrection" See "Scott and the Sublime," in Scott and His Influence, ed.
