<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRIoEF COMMUNICATIONS A PRE-SPANISH RECORD OF HOPI CEREMONIES It has been generally held that the Flute ceremony and its biennial alternate, the Snake-Antelope ceremony, are among the most ancient of Hopi ceremonies, also that Jeddito Valley people near First Mesa may have been Keres,1 Pueblos among whom snake ceremonial has been observed. Fresh evidence along these lines has come to hand in the design on a bowl from Jeddito Valley, now in the Southwest Museum. This bowl (Fig. 1) was excavated in 1901 in Jeddito Valley, either at Kawaika or Kokopnyumu, by the first U.S.N.M-Gates Expedition2 under the direction of Dr Walter Hough. The bowl is 81 inches in diameter and 4- inches deep, of thin- walled, fine, homogeneous clay well baked and having a musical ring when tapped. The slip is a pale yellowish cream, worn in spots. The designs are in brown. The outside design (Fig. 2) which suggests a textile, possibly a dance sash, is better drawn than the interior designs. The two large figures appear to be anthropomor- phic beings, Locust and Snake, patrons of the Flute society3 and Snake society. The other figures on the interior are naturalistic snakes and a naturalistic insect presum- ably a locust (Fig. 3).4 The anthropomorphic or animistic Snake is holding a naturalistic snake to his mouth.5 Inferably the head of the snake is inside his mouth. Both large figures are depicted as are dance figures in pictographs. I infer that this collection of figures represents not merely animistic concepts but a ceremony em- bodying such concepts. We may guess that the bowl was ceremonial pottery for the 1 E. C. Parsons, Early Relations between Hopi and Keres (American Anthropologist 38, 1936), pp. 554-560. L. L.

Reichard, Navajo Medicine Man, New York, 1939, P1. XIII). Navaho Arrow People are identified with the Locusts. Between Shooting Chant and Flute ceremony there are some intimate resemblances. Both are cures for lightning shock; Locust, birds, and the sacred mountains figure in the Emergence myth and on the altar of both. Again there are resem- blances between the Shooting Chant and the Snake-Antelope ceremony. A Bear impersonation figures at the Snake initiation, just as at the mythical initiation of Holy Man. The Antelope sand-painting is very like Navaho sand-painting-the "house" lines, the snakes which are made like the "messenger" snakes in P1. XIII, Navajo Medicine Man, and like the naturalistic snakes in our bowl.-I surmise that the Shooting Chant is old in the amazing involutionary system of Navaho sand-paintings, and that it may have been borrowed from the Hopi, per- haps even from Jeddito Valley people, at an early date. 5 Snake swallowing was a feature at Acoma where snake ritual was observed by Espejo in 1582.

I say society, not societies for the bowl is evidence for the theory that a closer relation between the two societies once existed in the social organization than is generally recognized by the townspeople today. Snake and Flute societies never were the same, said the Walpi Snake society chief to Stephen, although the Ship- aulovi Snake chief said that they were "long ago the same."' There is another hypothesis: the Snake-Antelope society may have been intro- duced by the immigrants from the Little Colorado, the Snake-Sand "clans" ac- cording to native tradition, and the Flute society from elsewhere, possibly from the Kayenta region where Flute altar-like objects were found,7 and in course of time correlations between the two societies may have developed. If the bowl was ceremonial, this would account for the naturalistic designs as distinguished from the prevailing geometric designs of Jeddito-First Mesa pottery. Zuni ceremonial pottery shows naturalistic designs although design on the pottery in daily use is predominantly geometric. From Awatobi Dr Brew reports a sur- prisingly frequent occurrence of realistic life forms, both in painted designs and in the round.s The outstanding significance of our bowl lies in dating. It is a specimen of the Jeddito-Old Shumopovi yellow ware described by Kidder (Southwestern Archae- ology, 93, pl. 42, e)9 and found by him at Second Mesa and in the Jeddito Valley at Kokopnyumu, Awatobi, and Nechepatanga, ware found also by Brew at Awatobi and described as made about the latter half of the fourteenth century.10 The bowl indicates that the Snake-Antelope and Flute ceremonies were performed on Second Mesa and in Jeddito Valley" as early as the fourteenth century, the first prehis- toric date to be ascertained not for various contemporary Pueblo rites but for the ritual complexes known as ceremonies.

Tree-ring dates for Kokopnyumu are 1269-1435; for Kawaika, 1357-1495. 1' In Second Mesa tradition Old Shumopovi was settled by Sikyatki survivors, as Sikyatki was settled by Jeddito people, and Mishognovi, by Awatobi survivors (Stephen, p. 146). In other words, connections between Jeddito Valley, Sikyatki, and Second Mesa covered a con- siderable period. As has been pointed out elsewhere, the destruction of Sikyatki and Awatobi suggests intertribal hostility.</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, N.
