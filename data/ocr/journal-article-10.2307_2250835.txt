[Those unable to accept philosophy in any of " the fantastic forms that it presents " can find " a refuge in the attitude of research ".1 P. C. Jones. Idealism and Its Relation to Science. [A summary restatement of subjective idealism. Argues that the truth of " philosophical idealism " is independent of any truths of natural science.] A. F. Bentley. Declassifying Dewey. [Severe criticism of a paper by .E. 0. Sisson (in Phil. Sci., July, 1940).] H. Giomperz. The Meanings of " Meaning ". [An analysis whose interest results largely from its adherence to what Gomperz styles " the principle of terminological conservatism ", viz., the injunction to " keep as close as possible to its traditional meaning" when analysing the variant usages of such a term as meaning. (The obvious difficulty, which is not altogether faced in.the paper, is of knowing how close " as close as possible " is to be construed as being.) Gomperz distinguishes three main senses of meaning, (a) as predicated of facts, (b) as ascribed to linguistic expressions, (c) as equivalent to implication. All the " applications " of the term to mean are regarded as " different species of a common genus ". Since to mean and to signify " appear to be used almost indiscriminately" (interchangeably ?) the analysis of the former resolves into an anatomy of signs. Subject to certain qualifications, " s is said to function as a sign for another object or fact o " (for a person P) " in so far as P's response to s is similar to what would have been P's response to o ". Signs are cross-classified by the dichotomies natural- arbitrary and linguistic-non-linguistic. The meaning of linguistic signs is discussed from the standpoints of pragmatics and semantics, and a distinction is made between the grammatically meaningful, the logically meaningful, and the practically meaningful. Application is made to the principle of verifiability. The discussion is presented as a sample of a method which would " if widely and consistently applied tend considerably to reduce the number and the significance'of epistemological problems." But the clarification of the meaning of terms in the way illustrated in the paper " is really the job of philology rather than of philosophy ".] C. Hartshorne. Anthropomorphic Tendencies in Positivism. [" . . . posi- tivism, whether old or new, is a version of the doctrine of Protagoras, that man is the measure of things. Certain limitations of the human mind are mistaken for characteristics of the universe ". Hartshorne argues (i) that positivists unjustifiably identify the experience of which the human mind is capable in a certain " cosmic epoch " with experience in general, (ii) that such knowledge as is achieved in the sciences presupposes the validity of certain metaphysical propositions (notably " the law that there shall be law, from which the validity of 4cientific induction as a principle can be deduced "), (iii) that positivism " takes sides " upon a metaphysical question, " the issue of nominalism and realism in one of its more adequate formulations ". It is suggested that " theology is the only radical way to overcome anthropomorphism ". " There ought to be a language deanthro- pomorphised enough to express a dog's sensations as they are to him, yet</page><page sequence="2">88 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. in precise comparison to the experiences of the mind knowing the dog as those are to that mind. Only one such language is conceivable, but it is something more than just a language; the knowledge superior to symbolic thought, realised in the sympathetic intuitions of God."] E. C. Kemble. The Probability Concept. [Distinguishes between a priori, inductive and theoretical probability. " In the opinion of the author the long-standing controversy over the meaning of probability is due primarily to the universal but unjustified assumption that the word has a single unique meaning."] A. Kardiner. Psychoanalysis and Psychology. A compari- son of Methods and Objectives. [Describes, in a general way, the aims and methods of Freudian psychoanalysis.] W. J. Norton, Jr. Towards a Value Theory of Mind. [Argues that " no understanding of mind can be arrived at unless two things at least be shown: (1) that mind presupposes objective values; i.e., rests upon them for its own intelligibility, and (2) that in itself mind implies an active attitude towards the attainment of values by seeking their actual expression."] Reviews.
