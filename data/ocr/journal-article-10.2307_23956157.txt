<plain_text><page sequence="1">72 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Israel: Its Life and Culture, III-IV, by Johs. Pedersen. Pp. 788. London: Oxford University Press, 1940. 2ir. 6d. This volume completes Dr. Pedersen's psychological study of Israel's life and culture. The first volume (parts I—II) appeared in Danish in 1920 and in English in 1926 (see 'Chronicle of Old Testament and related literature' in J.T.S., vol. xxix, pp. 98 ff., Oct. 1927). The second volume appeared in Denmark in 1934 and was ready for pub lication in England in 1940, but has only recently been made available. It follows so closely on the argument of I—II that it may be useful to summarize the contents of the earlier before going on to a review of the later volume. Part I is a psychological study of the Hebrew conception of the personality ('soul') of man, of the power which emanates from it, and of the forces which impinge and operate on it. Emphasis is laid on the unity of the soul and on the idea of totality. This 'totality' of the soul is inclusive, every element of life being taken up into it. ' The soul is wholly in everything belonging to it or emanating from it, therefore it must be wholly in the impress which it leaves on another's soul' (p. 132). It extends beyond the things pertaining strictly to the individual and merges into the 'totality' of family, clan, or tribe. Part II then goes on to a detailed examination of the factors which enter into the social and communal life of the people—the covenant, and the principles of righteousness, truth, and justice—and describes the practices and laws arising out of, or governing, these principles. The volume ends with a sketch of the Hebrew conceptions of life and death. The view of the soul so expounded enables the author to re present personal and social relationships as organic and not merely as customary or conventional. '... the annihilation of the covenant would not only be the ruin of society, but the dissolution of each individual soul' (p. 308). The second volume (parts III-IV) passes on to a full, but often very discursive, examination of the idea of holiness. This is shown to be the source of the strength necessary for the successful pursuit of life. Holiness was originally concentrated in certain persons and things. Kings, chieftains, prophets, and priests were all sources and centres of holiness—they are said to be 'impregnated' with it. We are told, for example : ' The priesthood spreads a net of Israelite holi ness over the land' (p. 189). The earlier chapters, therefore, are occu pied with long descriptions of these groups of leaders, showing in what relation they stood, at different periods of Israel's history, both to the people who were dependent upon them and to Yahweh the ultimate source of all holiness. Certain places and objects were also 'marked by an immense concentration of sacred strength' (p. 198).</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 73 Accordingly, the last two chapters of part III examine the nature and history of the traditional holy places and objects—Sinai, the local sanctuaries, the tent, the Ephod and the Teraphim, and the Ark being the chief subjects of discussion. Throughout the argument a distinc tion is made by the author between ' blessedness ' which is the charac teristic of a full, healthy life and which all men can and must have if life is to continue, and 'holiness' which is rooted in Yahweh, is mediated by those persons and things in which it is concentrated, and, though mostly a power for good, is capable of inflicting grievous harm if wrongly approached (p. 267). The fourth part is concerned with the renewal and the source of holiness. In brief, its renewal is dependent on the observance of festivals and sacrifices and its source is to be sought solely in Yahweh, the God of Jerusalem. In his discussion of sacrifices Dr. Pedersen, whilst accepting in part the view that they were in origin gifts to God, shows how they were intended also to be a means of sanctifying the land and its produce so as to ensure successful repetitions of growth and harvest. He then goes on to show how, as the Israelite cultus became centralized, they were gradually detached from their organic connexion with Nature and came to be associated rather with the history of Israel and her relation to God through that history. The same transference of thought from natural processes to historical events is seen in the development of the festivals. With the increasing significance of the priesthood and the emphasis on Jerusalem as the sole sanctuary a change of interpretation was inevitable. The Passover slowly lost all connexion with sanctification of flocks and first-fruits and found new and enriched meaning in the experience of history. 'Re-living the Paschal legend, the Israelites sanctified their history and thus strengthened the foundation of their life and the relation to their God' (p. 409). This Paschal legend is written in Exod. i-xv, which Dr. Pedersen, who does not fully accept the customary analysis of the Pentateuch into documents, regards as a single narrative apart from a few inconsistencies. In the closing chapters of the book attention is focused on the growth in the idea and knowledge of Yahweh, who, from being known and worshipped locally on Sinai and in Zion, came to be recognized as universal sovereign. The germ of this development is traced to David's act in bringing the Ark into Jerusalem, for in that act ' he appropriated the whole history of Israel for the new monarchy and established the identity of its God with that of the ancient God of the people' (p. 524, cf. 229). Elsewhere Yahweh is described as the 'soul of the history of the people' (p. 512). The part played in this process by prophet and priest, religious reforms, Exile and Return is reviewed, and the book closes with the recognition of the twofold</page><page sequence="3">74 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES endeavour in Israel, first, to exalt Yahweh above everything, and second, ' to bring Israel into more and more intimate relations with him' (p. 669). This is an important book which no student of Israel's psychology, life, and social customs will be able to ignore. Dr. Pedersen has again and again succeeded in bringing ancient Israelite thoughts and prac tices to life before our eyes, as, for example, in the vivid description of the temple activities (pp. 254 ff.). It is enriched also by many fresh and interesting points of exegesis. The reader must be prepared, however, to find his way about a book which is both long and diffuse in treatment and in which he will find no very clear indication at times of the direction the author is taking. Moreover, some readers may feel that the author has sometimes interpreted ancient Hebrew thought in ways which go beyond what the records warrant. This is chiefly so in what he has to say about soul and spirit. In parts I—II he spoke of the nephesh as the centre of personality, laying more emphasis on it than most scholars, making it at times, indeed, a separate and separable part of human personality. ' The Hebrews ', he says, 'are quite able to distinguish soul and body ' (p. 170). This in terpretation forms the background of parts III-IV in which the author speaks of the soul of man 'pervading' external objects (pp. 79, no, 214 f.). Moreover, there is ambiguity in speaking of both the soul and the spirit of God. Quite frequently Dr. Pedersen speaks of the soul of God where presumably he means what we should call the spirit of God (pp. 42, 54, 107, in). In two respects, at least, this is mis leading, first, because the body or the flesh is the fundamental element in human personality, and by this use of the term soul the full force and significance of Old Testament anthropomorphism are swept aside, and second, there is really no word for soul in Hebrew; it is true that nephesh may sometimes be so translated (this underlies what is said in I—II about the soul of man), but in any case nephesh is used only fifteen times in respect of God. One further point may be mentioned. Although it is useful to have a picture of Israel's life so carefully presented against the background of the unity of the group and the ' totality ' of all that enters into the realm of personality, we ought not to overlook the developing sense of individuality which may be traced back to quite early times in Israel. It is difficult to imagine that the sense of individuality was so weak that the Hebrews could think of a man's personality as passing over into inanimate objects such as the King's throne (p. 79) or the prophet's mantle or staff (p. 118). So impersonal a way of representing human personality scarcely does justice to the vivid sense of personal relation ship, between man and God as well as between man and man, so characteristic of the Old Testament.</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 75 The English translation was made in Denmark and on the whole is very well done, but, as might be expected, it buffers here and there by the introduction of un-English forms and idioms. On the other hand, there are surprisingly few misprints for a book of such length printed abroad. L. H. Brockington L. H. Brockington</page></plain_text>
