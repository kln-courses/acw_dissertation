The whale attracted worldwide at- tention and directly impacted a community. Each stakeholder held strikingly varied opinions about what to do with this lonely whale that had been tagged as L98 and nicknamed Luna. The Whale: The True Story of Luna is a film that chronicles the tale of a whale separated from his pod and how interwoven it becomes in the daily lives of people. The anthropomorphic traits ascribed to Luna are difficult to avoid as he I interacts with individuals by trailing boats, nudging canoes, and seeming to play fetch by bringing floating sticks to outstretched hands. Mi- chael Parfit and Suzanne Chisholm were intrigued by Luna when they worked on an article about him for the Smithsonian. They found a com- munity that wanted to interact with the orca and, in essence, befriend him; float plane owners furious about the damage Luna caused to their planes; governmental agencies that wanted human contact with the whale to be minimal or non-existent, to the extent that they threatened people with a $100,000 fine; the First Nations tribe that believed Luna was a reincarnation of their chief; and an active stewardship program to preserve orcas in the wild. With all the stakeholders as- sembled, a plan to relocate Luna was met with joy and resistance. Throughout it all, Luna was thriv- ing in the Nootka Sound. He had plenty of fish and socialized with people in the absence of a family pod. The documentary footage over the years was edited magnificently to portray the struggle that occurs when difficult decisions must be made because humans have become attached to wild animals and vice versa. "What is best for the species?" is the central question. Ryan Reyn- I SHARE YOUR IDEAS! Have an idea for an inspiring presentation or workshop on science education?

Need some help with science-liter- acy development? I really enjoyed reading over this publication. It has that was very powerful. Another part I enjoyed was the section on explaining how to use evidence, since many students want to make claims based on opinion instead of evidence. Another great part of the book was been well thought through and well about teaching students how to take written. There is not much that has notes. I know that skill helped me been left out.
