<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exorcism from the Streets to the Tomb: An Image of the Judge and Minions in the Xuanhua Liao Tomb No. 7 JEEHEE HONG Syracuse University The concern uncertain surrounding fate of the tomb-making dead was always in traditional a major concern surrounding tomb-making in traditional China. A series of rituals were conducted before, during, and after the burial to securely send the deceased off to the other world, shaping the tomb site as a conceptual nexus of the manifold rites of passage.1 While the funeral conducted prior to the entombment was to end at the tomb chamber as the destination of the physical body, a new ritual process - through images and objects devoid of any living agency - began where the funerary ritual was finished: the transfer of the deceased to the nether- world and/or the transformation of the deceased into an eternal being.2 The separation between these ritual phases in the larger context of the funerary process is thus marked at both the physical and symbolic levels.3 However, in tombs where there are many images that refer to preburial rites - some by direct description and others through metonymy - a sense of ritual continuity that may have transcended the clear division of those phases is too strong to ignore. Symptoms of the ritual continuum and the roles of representations in linking the two worlds have been touched upon with varied degrees of focus and depth in previous studies of distinctive subjects. For example, images of the deceased, which occupied a central place in the funerary space and had a predominantly iconic significance, have been considered for their potential function as the focal point of the worshipping rite.4 Images of the funerary ritual, of which there are a much smaller number of extant examples (often highlighting selected moments of the ritual), have been studied in the context of the symbolic journey of the deceased to the netherworld.5 Last of all, images of exorcism in the tomb space have been studied with an emphasis on their particular role as a purifier and/or protector of the burial site.6 All three themes were adopted for represen- tation in the space for the dead by the second century ce at the latest, and production of these kinds of images continued with some frequency throughout China's middle period (ninth-fourteenth centuries). Although the roles of such images within the burial chamber have been discussed at length in previous studies, the notion of how they might have manifested or con- tributed to ritual continuity between the realms of the living and the dead remains largely unexplored. The focus of this essay is one of the themes mentioned above: exorcism, the least studied of the three. Exorcism as a representational motif in tombs is doubly distinguished from the other two themes: unlike the deceased and the funerary rite, which are exclusively connected to the funerary discourse, exorcism was a ritual broadly associated with the realms of both the living and the dead, and hence is embedded with a ritual duality of its own. Also, images of exorcism charted a distinctive path as a pictorial motif in the burial space. Representations of semi-anthropomorphic exorcists such as Fangxiang or Chiyou for example, appeared ubiquitously in Eastern Han tombs (25-220 ce), but almost dis- appeared from burials after that time.7 Such a waxing and waning of exorcism as a subject in tomb art suggests a general shift of interest in repre- senting particular themes in tombs, rather than reflect- ing changes in the degree of popularity of exorcists aboveground.8 In light of such a trend in representation, an unusual depiction of an exorcism in a middle-period tomb deserves special attention. A small mural of five grotesque figures painted in an eleventh-century tomb in Xuanhua 1 Ëib, Hebei province, offers a rare glimpse of the intersection between exorcistic and mortuary practices in northern China during the middle period (Fig. 1). Because its variegated ritual genesis has gone unnoticed in previous studies, this image has usually been interpreted as performing a protective role for the burial chamber.9 Although I agree largely with this view, I would like to call attention to the complex web of ritual practices underlying the image, which reveals how the image dynamically linked the tomb space with the world of the living. The extent to which the space of the dead embraced the ritual experiences of the society of the living demonstrates the ritual continuity between the two worlds conceived by middle-period Chinese.</page><page sequence="2">2 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. i.

"Five Ghosts" or A Troupe of Performers The mural occupies a small section of a tomb in the well-known Zhang family cemetery of Liao dynasty in Xiabali TAM village, two miles west of Xuanhua.10 According to the epitaph, the tomb belonged to a man named Zhang Wenzao 3R:$C5!, who died in 1074 and was reburied in this location in 109 3. 11 Located near the southeastern border of Inner Mongolia and present- day Hebei province, this area had experienced political turmoil since the early tenth century, during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907-960). It only became secure under the single governance of the Liao dynasty in 938, and was renamed Guihua zhou until the collapse of the dynasty in 1 125. 12 Guihua zhou shared some government functions with two of the five capitals - Western (Datong fu and Southern Capitals (Xijin fu - and a fair number of officials would have resided in the area.13 Thus, it would have enjoyed a certain level of cultural sophistication. Zhang Wenzao's tomb was among ten tombs found in the area, located in the eastern section of the site, where it was clustered with four other tombs.14 Accord- ing to the epitaphs, most members of the Zhang family were affluent and learned, yet did not hold any offices in the Liao court - except the occupant of Tomb No. 1, Zhang Shiqing 35 tï®. He was a nephew of Zhang Wenzao, and his life and status in the family deserve our attention, as he was in charge of the construction of his uncle's tomb.15 Zhang Shiqing held a series of low-ranking offices and was able to contribute to the community financially in the time of a famine, for which he was rewarded with some official titles.16 The Zhang family can be therefore characterized as part of a local elite, some of the members of which held minor offices yet had sufficient means to construct elaborate tombs for the family. Zhang Wenzao's tomb is composed of a rectangular antechamber and a round rear chamber, the two con- nected by a narrow corridor (Fig. za, b ); vivid paintings of different motifs decorate all the walls. In the ante- chamber are, in addition to the mural of five grotesque figures on the south wall, depictions of musicians and a dancer on the west wall, and of several children at play and grown-ups preparing tea on the east wall (Fig. 3a, b). Unique in its motif among all the tomb murals in Xuanhua family cemetery, the small mural painted in the arch of the south wall, at the entrance to the tomb, presents five sinewy figures painted using ink and pale color. In terms of form and gesture, they can be divided into three groups: the two figures at each end of the painting, the two figures in the middle who are inter- acting with each other, and the single figure wearing a headdress immediately to the right of the latter.</page><page sequence="3">JEEHEEHONG • Exorcism from the Streets to the Tomb 3 Fig. 2a.

Detail of Fig. 1 (figure at far left and figure at far right). The figure at the far left has a nearly bald head, with just a little bit of hair, and is wearing only a loin- cloth (Fig. 4a). He is holding a paiban - a popular percussion instrument used in musical and theatrical performances at both religious and secular events - and seems to be gazing at the other figures. His entire body is pale blue, set off by the contrasting thin reddish loin- cloth. The figure at the far right, also pale blue and wearing only a loincloth, squats on the ground with his back to the viewer and holds a long, slender object (Fig. 4b). In addition to the coloring that they have in common, both have skinny limbs. Although their bodies are human in form, their eccentric costumes, body color, and style of hair, and the lack of eyeballs in the sockets of the figure on the left, endow them with a grotesque and ghostly character. The pair of figures in the middle of the tympanum are dressed only in white loincloths, but they are dis- tinguished from the first two in terms of their facial features and whitish color (Fig. 5). 17 Their heads, with Fig. 5. Detail of Fig. 1 (figures in the middle). no indication of fleshy volume except their ears, appear skeletal: they are smooth, round, and hairless, and there is a vertical line that runs from the top of the head to the mouth, like the suture in mammal skulls. Their bodies and faces are discernibly whiter than those of the first pair. One of the two figures has its arm outstretched as if it is trying to touch the forehead of the other; and in its other hand this figure holds a long, wiry stick with a rope tied near the top, perhaps a kind of tool for catch- ing something or someone. There is an unidentifiable white, round object on top of this figure's head. The second figure leans over in an unstable posture, as if trying to elude the first figure's outstretched arm. On</page><page sequence="5">JEEHEE HONG • Exorcism from the Streets to the Tomb 5 Fig. 6. Detail of Fig. 1 (figure at the far right). the ground near its feet lies a long stick, which it seems to be about to grab. This pair's gestures and poses create a clear sense of tension, uncanny and playful at once, which is emphasized by their central position in the painting. To the right of the pair of skull-headed figures stands the last figure, wearing an elaborate form of headgear, shoulder coverings (possibly epaulettes or a capelet), and ragged-looking shorts (Fig. 6 ). The headgear consists of a round cap with a winglike, oval-shaped bar on either side (like those on a literary official's hat such as niaoshamao Fig. ya) and a crestlike ornament at the top (resembling a military official's helmet; Fig. jb ), an ambiguous hybrid form indicating the headgear's fabricated nature. The shoulder coverings might very well be part of a military outfit, an interpretation that would correspond with the crest on the headgear. The ambiguity is augmented by his ragged short pants, the casualness of which contrasts sharply with the formality of the clothing on the torso, and thus seems incon- gruous. Although his face is drawn primitively, like a simple caricature, it possesses basic facial components that are complete and articulated, such as eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, and, most distinctively, eyeballs - the element that the other figures lack. The authors of the archaeological report have de- scribed this small mural as a "picture of the realm of ghosts (or demons)" (guiyi tu in which a ghost is arrested by an official from the underworld (and taken to the netherworld).18 According to this view, the figure described last (with the relatively elaborate costume) represents a ghost official, and the skull-headed figure bending over is the ghost who is being arrested; and the three objects - the paiban at the left, the stick with a rope attached in the middle, and the slender object at the right - are all interpreted as some sort of torture tools. Although this description might seem plausible in general terms, the authors' interpretation is not based on what is depicted, much less on any historical sources. Careful observation of the figures' traits and the overall composition leads to different conclusions about their identities and their roles in the tomb space. First, the assumption that all five figures belong to a single narra- tive of "arresting a ghost" is questionable. As pointed out above, only one figure is engaged in what appears to be an attempt at capturing another; moreover, it is unlikely that the former is in a superior position relative to the latter, since the two share identical physical fea- tures, thus categorizing them as a pair. The possibility that the two figures at each end are connected to the middle two figures' action is even more dubious; each of them seems to be concerned with his own activities outside the central circle, as if they are onlookers who are not directly involved with what is being performed on the "stage." For example, the figure at the far left is playing the paiban , and his body is turned toward the three figures in the middle as if making special sounds for the "performance" taking place there. Similarly, the figure at the far right may also be seen as playing some kind of musical instrument, perhaps a zither, without directly engaging with the ongoing event in the middle. The image as a whole thus could present a performance space, rather than a narrative space in which each figure as a character participates in the composition of a single plot, such as the scheme of the "realm of ghosts."</page><page sequence="6">6 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 7a.

The spatial layers created by the tension, distance, and varied degrees of interaction among the figures sug- gests that a kind of theatricality choreographs their actions for conscious display. In fact, certain formal elements, such as the number of figures in a troupe as well as the ways in which they are grouped, point to the strong pos- sibility that they represent a theatrical performance.19 Given that the pairing up of actors in comedic duos was already a common form in early dramatic perform- ances,20 the two middle figures' exaggerated gesticula- tions and the apparent tension between them resonate with such a theatrical convention. Furthermore, the way in which the notion of gui % is used needs to be reconsidered. The report identified all the figures as gui without providing any connection between their visual characteristics and the term. The visual distinctions among the figures outlined suggest that, rather than forming a single group, they were</page><page sequence="7">JEEHEEHONG • Exorcism from the Streets to the Tomb 7 carefully differentiated by the painter(s) as sets. In addi- tion, the word gui in medieval and middle-period China had multiple connotations, depending on the context. Often more versatile than that of the modern concep- tion of "ghost," gui in middle-period China could refer to numinous hun souls of the deceased; or a wander- ing posthumous soul who has no familial bonds; or a kind of seminal pneuma of such things as stones, trees, mountains, or water; or a lesser or great demonic figure - especially when appearing as a chief or a king - who judges the dead in Buddhist and Daoist discourses that had developed since the late Six Dynasties (220- 589).21 At stake is our understanding of how certain visual features and roles of these grotesque figures were associated with particular concepts and terms - be it a ghost or a demon - in the ways that contemporaries, including the painters and patrons, would have conceived of them.22 In fact, their characteristics went far beyond a single abstract notion of a "ghost," which basically oscillated between demonic beings and human actors. The Judge and Little Demons: Exorcism for the Living The theatrical cues observed in the mural suggest that the visual topoi of the image could have derived from contemporary experiences of actual performances. A log- ical place to look for such practices is a social stratum or environment outside the tomb in which the specific pictorial idioms of this painting - uncanny in its form and theatrical in its mode - were shaped: performative events that featured semihuman creatures. A valuable source for descriptions of seasonal festi- vals, rituals, and the daily life of the people in the Song capital city of Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng Uti), Dongjing menghua lu (Record of dreamy splendors of the Eastern Capital),23 includes a series of tableaux reminiscent of the ghostly performers in this mural. A series of flamboyant variety shows were performed on the main street of Bianjing as part of the celebration of the Qingming Festival (Qingming jie i#BSSp) in spring, one of the extensive celebrations of the New Year:24 Then there comes the sound of another "Exploding Staff," and out comes one character with a mask and long whiskers, wrapped in a green turban, with bootslips, looking like a representation of Zhong Kui MM- Beside him is another person who, using a small gong, calls [him] and dances around with [him]. This is called "The Dance of the Judge" (Wu pan H^lJ). [The performance] is continued by two or three haggard characters who have plastered their bodies with powder. With golden eyes and white faces, they look like skulls. They are wrapped in brocaded and embroidered waistbands around their bellies. They carry slapsticks in their hands; each makes jests and capers about. Their lifting [limbs] and stopping [movements] look as though [they are] putting on a play, and it is called "Silent Comedy" (Ya zaju töSHiil).25 In this detailed depiction of spectacles, the distinctive costumes, props, and makeup of the characters share striking parallels with those of the five figures depicted in the Xuanhua tomb. Among the most immediately recognizable similarities in their appearances are their skinny bodies, powdered faces, and simple cloth wraps. In fact, these features reappear in other sections of the same text; just before the quoted passage, the text describes actors painted in blue and wearing similar loincloths, playing the roles of "Stubborn Ghosts" (Ying gui WL%)-26 These descriptions suggest that such visual traits were commonly used in representing ghostly creatures in performances. Other details are also tellingly alike. For example, the lack of eyeballs in the cadaverous figures in the Xuanhua image seems to be an exaggerated pictorial appropriation of the "Silent Comedy" charac- ters' golden eyes on white masks. Especially noteworthy is the resemblance between the pseudo-official in the mural and the dancing "Judge" in the first segment of the performance. It is not only their leading roles within the performances but also the distinctive social position indicated by the official title conferred on the latter figure, i.e., "Judge," that link the two. The exact identity of the "Judge" in the text remains vague at this point, although he is intriguingly described as "Zhong Kui-like," based on the performer's costume. This unspecified character of the Judge was in fact an important persona in the ritual and religious life of middle-period Chinese. While his appearance was likened here to Zhong Kui, the well- known vanquisher of demons, it is important to recog- nize that the author, Meng Yuanlao šētc^, did make a distinction between the two characters.27 This character was clearly in the central position in the performance in terms of both the action and his status as a type of an official (hence the title of the segment, "The Dance of the Judge"), not as an anonymous dancer. Beyond the resemblances between the individual figures, the structure of this twofold performance also closely corresponds to the Xuanhua mural: "The Dance of the Judge" has much in common with the mural's official-looking figure and the musicians around him, and the description of the two skinny characters with</page><page sequence="8">8 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART skull-like faces in the "Silent Comedy" who make jests and tease each other using their slapsticks is comparable to the interaction of the pair of figures in the mural's central tableau. This is not to suggest that the painting is a representation of the two performance segments described in this particular text. Rather, by entertaining the possibility that contemporary experiences of such performances could have provided a prototypical visual source for the representation at hand, this notion of corresponding imagery situates the painting in a deeper structure of visual and ritual contexts. A better-focused picture emerges from a more ex- tended spatiotemporal look at the world of festivals. Although the two playful segments mentioned above are introduced only as some of the numerous entertain- ments offered during the Qingming Festival, an attentive reader of Dongjing menghua lu would soon encounter recurrent characters in the descriptions of other seasonal events addressed in the text. The Judge, along with Zhong Kui, was one of numerous figures featured in the masquerade extravaganza of the imperial exorcism on New Year's Eve: When it comes to New Year's Eve, the Great Exorcism Rite ( Danuo Aft) is performed in the Forbidden City [The actor] Nan Hetan of the Court Entertainment Bureau, who is ugly and fat, would dress up as the Judge ( Pan'guan Others dress up as Zhong Kui and his little sister, as the god of earth and of the [deity of the] kitchen- stove and the like. There are altogether more than a thousand people, and they drive the evil spirits out of South Gate of Fragrance to Twisting Dragon Bend. They call this simply "Burying Evil Spirits" (. Maisui iSS).28 In this vivid description of the Great Exorcism (Danuo), costumed characters seem to play the central role for expelling baleful spirits. Among more than a thousand characters, the first mentioned is the "Judge." Again dis- tinguished from Zhong Kui, the Judge is portrayed as hideous and strange, the predictable characteristics that were most likely believed to have endowed him with the power of exorcism. The Judge who made an appearance in the Qingming Festival emerges as a crucial denomina- tor in contemporary exorcisms, placing him in the larger context of the ritual performance of the time. Moreover, a fuller context for this particular exor- cist performance is contained in the events traditionally put on during the entire month of December (in the lunar calendar). During the last month of a year, three or four poor folks in a group masquerading as deities and lesser spirits would knock on every neighbor's door, banging gongs and drums, requesting money as a bribe for protecting the donor from plague or evil spirits. The kind of exorcist parade casually organized by towns- people was also unofficially called da yehu fTSřM ("expelling wild demons").29 Notably, one of the char- acters included in the "deities" and "lesser spirits" was the Judge.30 It is apparent from the way the seasonal events are arranged in Dongjing menghua lu that this masquerade of the Judge, along with other characters, would have continued throughout the month, prior to the Great Exorcism on New Year's Eve.31 It can there- fore be suggested that the character of the Judge and the other deities in the exorcist parade were virtually the same demon vanquishers who were expected to expel baleful spirits during the "Burying Evil Spirits" ritual on New Year's Eve. The Judge in the exorcist performance was accompanied to the site of the ritual by a group of deities or spirits, even when they were absent at the moment of the exorcism. The popularity and expected efficacy of the Judge as an exorcist would have prompted people to depict his images in the burial chamber. While the mural in the Xuanhua Tomb No. 7 alludes to a composite exorcist performance in action, in another middle-period case the Judge alone was emphasized a single deity. A stone panel found in a thirteenth-century tomb in Haikang $55Ë, Guangdong, bears an engraved image of the Judge, along with the inscription that reads "the Judge of the Tomb Gate" (Mumen pan'guan UHÁJIT; Fig . 8 ).32 Whether the term was widely used in the north as well cannot be determined, but it is noteworthy that the Judge figure had gained a specific name exclusively asso- ciated with the funerary context. Performing between Two Worlds: Ontology of the Judge Who was the Judge, and what was his appeal as one of the most popular characters in exorcism? More pre- cisely, what was the nature of the "judgment" involved? Although the name "Judge" was obviously derived from the existing title of juristic magistrates, the action of "judging" had been charged with the ideas of the netherworld since medieval times. An episode recorded in the late-seventh-century text Chaoye qianzai ^fSc ( Comprehensive record of affairs within and out- side the court) by Zhang Zuo jjgjg (ca. 660-740) intro- duces the ambiguous ontology of a "Judge" whose activities involved the netherworld. In this episode, Em- peror Taizong of the Tang dynasty is visited by his minister, who foretells Taizong's death the following</page><page sequence="9">JEEHEEHONG • Exorcism from the Streets to the Tomb 9 Fig. 8.

That night, soon after Taizong enters a coma, a man appears before Taizong and requests that the em- peror leave with him right away, yet promises that he will release Taizong soon after. When asked to identify himself, the man says, "This subject is a living man who judges otherworldly affairs."33 As in numerous other medieval stories of a person traveling to the netherworld, Taizong in this episode also experiences a short trial in the subterrestrial court, and is released back to the world of the living. After waking up, Taizong orders his staff to endow the man from the netherworld with an office. Although there is no specific title given to the char- acter who takes Taizong and leads him back to the world, his self-identification as a human official who makes judgment on things concerning the netherworld is an indirect indication of his status as a magistrate from purgatory. This episode makes a clear reference to the medieval Buddhist concept of the terrestrial court in hell where souls of the deceased were to be interrogated by ten kings.34 Although the terminological distinction is often ignored for convenience - the kings (wang Ī) were also sometimes called pan'guan in popular stories - the hierarchy of the kings and their subordinates, the assist- ing magistrates, was clear both in texts and in visual representations. The kings had the power to make final judgments; the petty magistrates were not only the helpers of the kings but also the liaisons between the two worlds. The Judge's deep engagement with the everyday world is further illuminated by a slightly different ver- sion of this story. Michel Soymié has identified this magistrate as a man named Cui Ziyu a histori- cal figure from the Tang period, based on a manuscript from Mogao Cave 17 at Dunhuang. In his pioneering study on the acolytes of the Bodhisattva Dizang iftü (S: Ksitigarbha), Soymié has suggested that one of the magistrates depicted in a painting from Dunhuang, the Cui pan'guan can be identified as Cui Ziyu.35 In the well-known painting of Dizang Bodhisattva and the Ten Kings of Hell in the Musée Guimet in Paris (ca. 983), in the foreground of the upper section there are four figures wearing civil official's robes and holding hu tablets (Fig. 9). A cartouche placed beside each figure identifies each one as a pan'guan , with an indi- vidualized surname attached to it; it reads, from left to right, "Song ^ pan'guan "Wang pan'guan "Cui pan'guan and "Zhao pan'guan ."36 Whether every pan'guan in the painting corresponds to a historical figure remains an open question. Neverthe- less, the tangible connection between the Cui pan'guan and Cui Ziyu alludes to a remarkable status of the pan'guan: the particular form of the individualization of each magistrate in the painting was just enough to indicate his ambiguous identity - not too specific to be a singular historical figure, yet not as abstract and sym- bolic as the Ten Kings of Hell. The act of endowing each magistrate with an individualized surname thus suggests that contemporaries imagined the judges as local agents who had the social position in the world of the living yet who were in charge of assisting the Kings of Hell.37 The point here is not to claim that the pan'guan as a mediating figure between the two worlds derived from Buddhist discourse38 but to understand what made the pan'guan , as an existing official in the society of the time, suitable for people to imagine him as an acolyte of hell. Generally associated with the connotations of "judging" since the early period, "pan'guan" during the middle period was used broadly as a suffix indicat- ing a third-level executive officiai in a unit of territorial</page><page sequence="10">IO ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 9.

The pariguan was prevalent locally, and his func- tion so common in the everyday world, that both the imagery and discourse of the otherworldly judgment converged in exorcist rituals. Taking part in the extended street performances of the exorcism, sometimes dancing and other times marching, the pariguan would also be spotted in a later local exorcism, yet this time heavily imbued with the images of the judgment in hell. In a poem by the Southern Song literātus Liu Tang §[JÜ (fi. early thirteenth century), "Guan nuo" lift (Watch- ing the exorcism), a village exorcism unfolds with a series of performances by recognizable characters already familiar to us. It begins with the resonating sound of drums and flutes, in which the exorcism evolves: The one with purple robe with golden seal alone occupies a table; The two with horse manes and ox cheekbones unroll [the scroll of] the judgment. [They are] able to say [whether or not] weal or woe comes from heaven: "By arduously following proper customs and limiting any excess, [I] distinguish the stupid from the wise!" The one with caltrop [branches] threatens a little demon in costume [His] flag with long manes flutters as loudly as women's wailing in a funeral; White-faced envoys with bamboo spears, Boastfully claim [they can] hunt and capture [demons], leaving none in hiding; The ox-hatted one clutching a scroll begins to examine and search, while The tiger-hatted one shouldering a halberd casts a furtive glance.42 A section of a long poem, this vivid description of the costumes, props, makeup, and actions of the char- acters reveals an intriguing combination of the two types of pariguan images: the pariguan helping out the Kings of Hell, and the street performance of the pariguan catching demons. Furthermore, this mixed form of exor- cism is evocative of the visual features of the figures painted in the Xuanhua tomb: the figures in animalistic costumes, such as an ox skull, control little demons in the scene; "white-faced officials" holding bamboo spears claim the ability to capture little demons.43 Although the iconic sight of the purple-robed figure seated before a table clearly resonates with contemporaneous depic- tions of the Kings of Hell (Fig. 10 ), notice how the con- tent of their judgment has been altered here: the judges are using the scrolls to find and catch demons, not to scrutinize the deeds of any deceased in his/her former life. In other words, the object of judgment in the original discourse has shifted and been applied to unidentified, collective evil spirits. Behind the action - the fundamental purpose of the exorcism, in fact - was the protection of individuals or a community, not punishment of them. Although the iconography of the Judges and Kings of Hell was still widely recognized and promoted within the Buddhist context, by the thirteenth century its visual features were thus borrowed and incorporated into exorcist practice. Since Liu Tang lived in the south from the early to mid-thirteenth century, this poem is not immediately relevant to the performance of the five figures depicted in the Xuanhua tomb.44 What should be noted, how- ever, is that the role of the pariguan and his crew as a major component of the exorcism popularized in the north in the preceding centuries appears in succeeding time periods, and also was further enriched by absorb- ing popular Buddhist images. Visually relocating the sites of exorcist performances from the streets of Bianjing to a southern town as such, we can conjure up the common sight of the Judge as an important exorcist with his semi- human minions and their targeted demons. Exorcism for the "Body" Viewed in this particular visual and ritual context, it can be inferred that the mural in the Xuanhua tomb displays popular images of exorcism. The local character given to the persona of the pariguan would have facilitated the assimilation of the exorcist performance into the lives of the Xuanhua townspeople, as it did in other parts of China during this time. When the exorcist performance made its way into the tomb space as an image, the painter(s) would have had options on how to render it so that the ritual expe- rience and efficacy of the exorcism could be effectively conveyed.

Zhang Jiangu (a mythical witness or guarantor of tomb contracts). Rubbing of stone engraving. From Cao Tengfei et al., "Guangdong Haikang Yuan mu chutu de yinxian ke zhuan," 176. mode was chosen in which the pariguan is singularly presented without any company, which would not have been an unusual form for talismanic images or repre- sentations of evil-slaying figures, as confirmed by other stone engravings found in the same tomb (Fig. 11 ).45 In the Xuanhua tomb, the quintessential characteristic of the pariguan as a mediator between two ontologically separate realms was conveyed visually by utilizing the theatrical mode. If the pair of music players and the dramatically acting group fill the pictorial space with a theatrical atmosphere, the position and gaze of the pariguan imply that the image as a whole assumes the "audience" of this performance that is situated outside the image-world. Gazing far off into space, and standing awkwardly off-center, the pariguan does not seem to be involved either in the main performance or in the musical accompaniment at the margins. Present within the picture plane yet disengaged from the pictorialized performance, the image of the pariguan alludes to his self-awareness - his own consciousness of the pictorial world to which he belongs.46 As an intermediary being situated between the world of the living and the dead - the attribute shaped through his complex origins - and between the "stage" and the "audience," the pariguan opens up a path between the picture plane confined in the narrow arch and the physical space of the tomb. It is not the direction of the pari guari s gaze but his disengagement itself that leads us to the question of the audience and efficacy of the painted exorcism. What was the exorcist image, evoking ritual practices origi- nally intended for the living, expected to do in a space specifically designed for the dead? What was the appeal of the intensely theatrical mode that was firmly rooted in the visual and ritual experiences of the living? The exorcism image's relationship to other murals in the tomb offers some clues. The exorcist motif and strong theatrical mode of the exorcism scene differ dras- tically from those of the other images depicted. On the west wall are painted a tableau of musicians and a dancer in formal attire; on the east wall, men and women preparing tea and children playing (Fig. 3a, b). Li Qìngquan in his comprehensive study of the Liao tombs in Xuanhua, has identified these activities, respectively, as a sanyue music performance and the preparations for a tea ceremony, together represent- ing an initial stage of the ritual of ancestral worship.47 The seemingly unnecessary depiction of three children hiding behind a stack of container boxes that are used in the ritual adds an element of playfulness that greatly enhances the scene's realistic quality. This choice of a mundane motif not only adds general liveliness to the scene, but, with its temporality firmly anchored in a specific moment, also effectively differentiates the antechamber from the rear chamber as a spatiotemporal setting. The rear chamber, created as a space unbounded by a single, particular temporal frame, is adorned with a series of images of female servants engaging in activities that punctuate different times of day in a single place. As Li Qingquan has observed, a woman adding oil to a lamp and another woman gesturing to lock the dummy door (Fig. 12a) on the west wall both signify nighttime, whereas the last figure on the east wall, carrying a cup of tea to a table set with writing tools, seems to be preparing the space for its occupant to write down Buddhist sutras or Daoist scriptures in the morning as a votive act (Fig. 12b ).48 Hsueh-man Shen has characterized this room as a typical Daoist jing shi ("tranquil room"), in which a person would light the lamps before</page><page sequence="14">14 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 12a. Servant adding oil to a lamp, and another servant locking the door, west wall, rear chamber of the tomb of Zhang Wenzao.

The motif of a small mural on the tympanum above the entrance in the rear chamber also evokes this idea of universal time embedded in the pictorial space (Fig. 13). It is a purely symbolic image of three men representing Confucian- ism, Buddhism, and Daoism playing chess, generally projecting an ideal immortal's world in which a person transcends all religious boundaries and achieves post- mortem immortality.51 The intermediacy embedded in the image of the exorcism, at both pictorial and iconographie levels, doubly engages with the temporal distinction between the two chambers. On the one hand, its quintessential^ performative mode of representation fits well within the bustling ambience of the antechamber. On the other, the pari guarì s liminal ontology, as a character who bridges</page><page sequence="15">JEEHEE HONG • Exorcism from the Streets to the Tomb 15 Fig. 12b.

Although the represented exorcism is thus linked to the pictorial world of the two chambers in different ways, the objects that it is directed toward are unam- biguous: the tomb occupants. As in other burials in the Xuanhua cemetery, Zhang Wenzao and his wife were placed in the coffin in the form of mannequins - two figures made of straw, containing cremated ashes of the deceased (Fig. 14a , b). A highly complex form of the corpse treatment, this practice has been addressed by only a few scholars in depth. Among many remarkable features, its origins and meanings can be generally de- scribed as an amalgamation of various religious and cultural practices in ritualizing the corpse.52 The signi- ficance of the ritual and ontological symbolism aside, what concerns us here is the totality of the attention paid to the corporeal presence of the bodies in the tomb. Within the "socially acceptable" boundaries of</page><page sequence="16">i6 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 13. Daoist priest, Confucian scholar, and Buddhist monk playing chess. Painting on the tympanum above the entrance in the rear chamber in the tomb of Zhang Wenzao. From Hebei sheng wenwu yanjiusuo, ed., Xuanhua Liao mu bihua , pl. 29. each religious and cultural practice, the conductor of this particular practice concentrated attention on pre- serving the physical substance and even restoring the form of the bodies.53 In other words, this emphasis on the physicality of the body seems to have been the central concept that drove the conductor of this practice to conflate categorically heterogeneous practices. That the bodies of Zhang Wenzao and his wife were so pre- sented nineteen years after Zhang's death intensifies the seriousness given to the "reconstruction" of the bodies. The real body was most likely gone, or already cremated, by the time it was reburied at this site; regardless, the ideal body had to be restored in its eternal form. This strong desire to retain the somatic presence of the deceased seems the most likely explanation for the vivid image of the exorcist performance in the Xuanhua tomb.54 Although the exorcism as a pictorial motif in burial chambers went out of vogue after the Eastern Han, its appearance in this tomb is reasonable: its inclu- sion was probably a way to respond to the immediate need for protecting the bodies of the deceased - with the bodies ritualized in the most corporeal form ima- ginable. The corporeality of the body, albeit symbolic, required the protection from pestilence or other bodily diseases, as well as from any harmful spirits. The Exorcism within and beyond the Tomb I have attempted to explain the variegated ritual con- texts and visual practices from which the mural of five grotesque figures in the Xuanhua tomb took its shape. Prominent in my analysis has been the manifold persona of the pariguan, as seen in a series of kaleidoscopic images of exorcist rituals and festivals in various written accounts. This semisocialized deity, which by the middle period had mutated and evolved, played an important role in fulfilling the wishes of the living to protect their welfare by expelling evil spirits and epidemics. Once established as a popular exorcist character, the pariguan not only continued to take an active part in the ritual world of the living but was also reborn as a dramatic character with the name of Guipan ("Ghostly Judge"). Numerous stories, exorcist perform- ances, and dramas produced during the Yuan and Ming periods (1279-1644) featuring trials by this character have survived.

Hangzhou by the sixteenth-century author Tian Rucheng the format and content of which both hark back to the Dongjing menghua lu and Mengliang lu (Record of the millet dream), describes a figure "dressed as Ghostly Judge" and identifies him as a lead exorcist.55 Several plays and comedies performed during the Yuan and late imperial periods featured familiar characters in exorcism such as "little demons" (xiao gui /'^%) and the Judge (Pan'guan).56 This trajectory of the incarnation of the pan'guan as a people's exorciser and its vital role in the cultural arena helps define the level of performativity evident in the small mural of the exorcism in the Xuanhua tomb. The mural's imagery of exorcism, showing various ac- tivities and rituals of the living, and suitably represented in the theatrical mode, had great potential to be enacted for the dead in the space specifically prepared for them. There may have been several reasons for such a virtual exorcism within the tomb space, but one of the more salient conditions was the presence of the deceased in corporeal form, presented with unusual intensity. The idea of "protection" hovering around this image should thus be distinguished from the generic and abstract sense of protection of the tomb space as proposed in previous studies; it corresponded to the sheer physicality of the deceased in a way that was intended to protect</page><page sequence="18">i8 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 14b. Remains of the bodies in the coffin, rear chamber in the tomb of Zhang Wenzao. From Xuanhua Liao mus vol. 2, color pl. 24. the living body. Oxymoronic as it may seem, the picto- rialized virtual exorcism assumed the enlivenment of the dead by treating them as if they had living bodies (not just the reconstruction of them) that required protection from pestilence and inauspicious spirits. It remains unclear why, in the cemetery that con- tains Zhang Wenzao's tomb, it would be the only one whose walls bear the highly theatrical exorcist scene.57 It is also premature to say to what degree this could be seen as a potential indicator of a changing conception of the burial chamber during the middle period as a space in which ritual experiences and practices from the realm of the living were deliberately incorporated. This essay has only begun to unravel the complexities of this issue; indeed, the question of how the conceptual construction of the tomb space, especially through representations, was in dialogue with ritual experiences in the society of the living during the middle period is a topic that de- serves further study.

My thanks to the chair of the panel, Carolyn Malone, and the audience members for their useful ques- tions and comments. My thanks also to Wen-shing Chou and Julia Orell for their comments on an earlier draft, and to Seunghye Lee for her help with image reproduction. Finally, I am grateful to two anonymous readers for Archives of Asian Art for their thoughtful suggestions. i. I define ritual as "rites of passage," based on Catherine Bell's discussion of ritual in her book Ritual Theory , Ritual Practice , 2nd ed. (New York: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 2009), pp. 19-29. Bell acknowledges the validity of the concept that Victor Turner posited as a basic structural pattern of the ritual, but she further emphasizes the organic, inseparable relationship between thought and action in ritual, i.e., what she calls "homol- ogization" of the dichotomy between them. For Turner's influential discussions of the notion of ritual and liminality, see Turner, From Ritual to Theatre : The Human Serious- ness of Play (New York: PAJ Publications, 1982). 2. The principal functions of the tomb space in the passage of the deceased were exemplified in these two basic ideas, even when tombs included images of Buddhist services or deities, or any other such images and objects closely associated with organized religions that theoreti- cally contradict the fundamental ideas underlying the prac- tice of ancestral worship as well as the tomb-making itself. 3. When focusing on the activities of the living that took place aboveground, the funeral (sang 5?) in prescrip- tive terms began with the initial ritual of soul-calling (fu ig or zhao hun and ended with the final worship cere- mony (yuji SIU). The soul-calling, which was carried out at the house of mourning, was a symbolic summoning of the deceased's soul back to the body before the official acknowledgment of its separation from the body. The yuji was a worship ceremony conducted when the mourners returned home from the burial site. Although the yuji marked the final stage of the first phase of the extended mourning ritual, which was itself composed of three suc- cessive ceremonies, mourning usually continued for another several years. For the soul-calling, see Yili fllUt ( Etiquette and rites), juan 35, pp. 1045-47; for the final worshipping, see Yili , juan 40, in Yili zhushu (Commentary on " Yili ") (Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 2008), vol. 3, p. 1216.

Wu Hung's in-depth studies of the images of tomb occupants demonstrate their role as a focal point of the symbolic worship in many cases from the second century BCE through the thirteenth century ce, a status derived from their marking and occupying the "spirit seat," rather than from their resemblance to the deceased as a "portrait" in a common sense; see Wu Hung, The Art of the Yellow Springs: Understanding Chinese Tombs (Honolulu: Uni- versity of Hawai'i Press, 2010), pp. 68-84. F°r discussions on the ritual meanings of the empty seat without the image of its occupant, see Wu Hung, "A Deity without Form: The Earliest Representation of Laozi and the Concept of Wei in Chinese Ritual Art," Orientations 34, no. 4 (2002): 38-45. However, as in the scholarship of tomb art gen- erally, this issue as it pertains to the middle period has begun to be examined only recently. For a preliminary study of the roles of deceased "portraits" in Song and Jin tombs in Henan and Shanxi areas, see Yi Qing, "Song Jin zhongyuan diqu bihua mu 'muzhuren dui (bing) zuo' tuxiang tanxi" 'KÎÀÏÎ (#) ® #t (Examinations of the images representing "tomb occu- pant couple seated face to face [or side by side]" in mural tombs of Central Plain from the Song and Jin periods), Zhongyuan wenwu 201 1.2: 73-80. 5. The Eastern Han tomb from Yinan, Shandong, is a good example.

The role of Fangxiang, the chief exorcist of the Great Exorcism (Danuo) since antiquity, was to exterminate pestilence or to purify ritual space, such as tomb chambers,</page><page sequence="20">20 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART by vanquishing evil spirits. For a discussion of the Great Exorcism, see Derk Bodde, Festivals in Classical China : New Year and Other Annual Observances during the Han Dynasty, 206 B.C.-A.D. 220 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton Uni- versity Press, 1975), pp. 75-138. 7. For an extensive discussion of the exorcist images in Eastern Han tombs in ritual contexts, see Patricia Berger, "Rites and Festivities in the Art of Eastern Han China: Shantung and Kiangsu Provinces," PhD diss., University of California, Berkeley, 1980. 8. By the same token, I reject the problematic assump- tion that the popularity of the exorcism motif during the Eastern Han is an unfiltered reflection of reality. Exor- cism was deeply ingrained in the everyday world of China throughout history, from the early dynasties to the late imperial period, and therefore this phenomenon should be understood in terms of the contemporary interest in representing the motif in the tomb space as tomb de- signers' conscious choices, rather than as mirroring the historical reality, as if exorcism was more prominent in early imperial times. 9.

The epitaph of Zhang Wenzao found in the tomb informs that the reburial was prepared as a token of filial piety and respect by the descendants, orchestrated by his nephew Zhang Shiqing. See Hebei sheng wenwu yanjiusuo, Xuanhua Liao mu , vol. 1, p. 123. 12. This area had been under the control of numerous short-lived dynasties such as the Later Liang (907-23), Later Tang (923-36), and Later Jin (936-46), before the Liao's march on this area in 938. See Tuotuo et al., Liao shi (History of the Liao dynasty ), juan 41, Dili zhi iftilS; (Geography) 5 (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1974), pp. 510-11. The area had been called Wuzhou Ä;jH, but was changed to Guihua zhou in 938, and retained that name for about 130 years, until the Jin dynasty renamed it Xuanhua and then Xuande in 1167 and 1168, respec- tively; see Tuotuo et al., Jin shi (History of the Jin dynasty) (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1975), juan 24, p. 569. No gazetteer with information about this area is avail- able, as is the case for most northern regions in Song times. But from limited historical sources, we know that Guihua zhou was one of many places in which Liao emperors had a local palace and an imperial villa, where they held meetings with officials or spent summers hunting; see Hebeisheng wenwu yanjiu suo, Xuanhua Liao mu, vol. 1, p. 3. 13. Its location between the Western and Southern Capitals, serving as the axis of the triangular capital zone, may have been one of the factors for the imperium to choose Guihua zhou as an unofficial subcapital. In addi- tion, judging from the peripatetic residential habits of the imperial house, it is likely that the area was frequented by members of the imperial court whenever they moved between the two capitals. For example, Taizong convened a meeting at Guihua zhou in the fifth year of the Huitong #|r] reign era (943) and "received a group of officials." See Tuotuo et al., Liao shi, juan 4, Taizong xia 51. 14. According to the epitaphs found in the tombs, eight of the ten belonged to a single Zhang family - all ex- cept Tomb No. 8, which was an unfurnished, undecorated tomb, and Tomb No. 4, which belonged to a man named Han Shixun. Several excellent studies of the individual tombs and the cemetery have advanced the research of these Liao tombs that generally followed traditional Chinese-style tomb-making, as opposed to the Khitan tradition. Therefore I will not deal with the entire site or the relationship among all the tombs, which involves a complex genealogy among the identified tombs. For that extensive genealogy of the Zhang family, including the ones whose tombs were not discovered yet (but whose names are mentioned in some of the epitaphs found in the excavated tombs), see Su Bai ÍHÉU "Xuanhua kaogu san ti" (Three topics regarding excavation of Xuanhua tombs), Wenwu 1998.1: 52- 15. Hebei sheng wenwu yanjiusuo, Xuanhua Liao mu, vol. i, pp. 123-24. Tombs Nos. 3, 7, and 10 were first constructed in 1093; No. 1 in 11 16; and Nos. 2 and 5 in 1117. 16. According to the epitaph, some of Zhang's official titles were given by the emperor Daozong for Zhang Shi- qing's contribution to the local community by opening his own grain storage and providing grain to people in the time of famine during the Da'an reign era (1085-95); see Hebei sheng wenwu yanjiusuo, Xuanhua Liao mu, vol. 1, p. 237. 17. Unlike the first two figures, the colors of this pair can be described as "whitish" since, though slightly different from each other, both basically share the white paste. It is unclear whether this was the intention of the painter (s) or the result of natural discoloration. 18. Hebei sheng wenwu yanjiusuo, Xuanhua Liao mu, vol. i, p. 90. An earlier report names it more simply as "picture of five ghosts/demons (wu gui tu )" Although this report describes the central, singular figure as "judgelike" (pan'guan), it provides no explanation.

The typical number of actors in early drama before the late Yuan was four or five. Wu Zimu Hēļfc provides one of the earliest descriptions (a brief one) of the basic role types of the Song zaju; see Wu Zimu, Mengliang lu (Record of the millet dream), in Dongjing menghua lu wai si zhong (^izg®) (Shanghai: Shanghai gudian wenxue chubanshe, 1956), pp. 308-9. 20. Among numerous accounts, see Duan Anjie KiSrfp, "Paiyou" (Actors), in Yuefu zalu (Miscellane- ous records on songs from the Music Bureau), Congshu jicheng chubian edition, no. 1659 (Shanghai: Shanghai Shangwu yin shu guan, 1936), pp. 20-22. 21. The meanings of the term gui in the first two examples reflect a more general and popular conception of the term developed early on in Chinese history, which is found in early texts such as the Liji ÍÜfB (Book of rites) or Zuozhuan žīfU (Commentary of Zuo); see Mu-chou Poo, "The Concept of Ghost in Ancient Chinese Religion," in Religion and Chinese Society, ed. John Lagerwey (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press; Paris: École française d'Extrême-Orient, 2004), pp. 173-91. The latter two ex- amples are a relatively later development, especially after Buddhism and Daoism as institutionalized religions became widespread during the Six Dynasties period. Particularly in a Daoist context, the term gui, often conflated with the term mo Jf| ("demon"), sometimes referred to a demon that existed in a supernatural realm, apart from a mortuary context. From the Six Dynasties to the Southern Song periods, this phenomenon became commonplace not only in a strictly Daoist sense but at a popular level. See the examples discussed in Angelika Ursula-Cedzich, "Ghosts and Demons, Law and Order: Grave Quelling Texts and Early Taoist Liturgy," Taoist Resources 4, no. 2 (1993): 23-36. Although Kamitsuka Yoshiko focuses on the concept of the "demonic" in a Daoist context, her care- ful discussion of the relationship between the notions of the demonic and the ghostly during the Six Dynasties is also helpful; see Kamitsuka, "Ma no kannen to shõma no shisõ" (The concept of "mo" (demonic) and the discourse of the extinguishing "mo"), in Chügoku kodõkyõ shi kenkyü (A study of the history of early Chinese Daoism), ed. Yoshi- kawa Tadao (Kyoto: Dõhõsha, 1993), pp. 89- 144, which was translated by Amy Miller and Thomas Peterson as "The Concept of Māra and the Idea of Expel- ling Demons," Taoist Sources 6, no. 2 (1996): 30-50. For anthropological observations on the relationship among concepts related to ghosts, see Arthur P. Wolf, "Gods, Ghosts, and Ancestors," in Arthur Wolf, ed., Religion and Ritual in Chinese Society (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1974), pp. 131-82. For the use of the appearances of ghosts in drama during the Yuan, see Karin Elizabeth Myrhe, "The Appearances of Ghosts in Northern Drama," PhD diss., University of California, Berkeley, 1998. Re- cently, Judith Zeitlin has explored the roles of ghosts par- ticularly in relation to femininity in late-imperial Chinese literature; see Judith T. Zeitlin, The Phantom Heroine : Ghosts and Gender in Seventeenth-Century Chinese Litera- ture (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2007). 22. Here I am thinking of common "visual knowledge" that would have been generally shared by people who be- longed to the same social sphere as the tomb occupant and his family. Within this shared visual knowledge, the viewers as well as the painters would have been able to identify these ambiguous figures in specific terms. Later in this essay, I demonstrate what constituted such visual knowl- edge in particular visual and ritual contexts. The next- closest concept that can articulate this point of view would be what is called visual literacy. Alluding to the compati- bility between seeing and reading, the concept of "visual literacy" has the virtue of not trying to solve the contradic- tion of "reading images" that is innate in the term, as W. J. T. Mitchell argues. Regarding popular visual culture of the past, however, the concept can serve as a way for art his- torians to understand certain images that are not readily identifiable in terms of motif or style in the language of their own time, due to the nature of such "marginalized" material, which tends to leave no literature directly pertain- ing to the images. For the most recent discussions of some of the limits and the potential of this concept, see James Elkins, ed., Visual Literacy (New York: Routledge, 2008). 23. Although this text by Meng Yuanlao îÊtuÎ: is a record specifically of the customs in the capital of the Song (960-1126), its content is helpful for understanding overall customs as well as material and visual culture in northern China during the eleventh century, for two reasons. First, since festivals and popular rituals are the result of long-established practice, it is reasonable to assume that the content of this text would convey the basic forms of cultural activities that were typical in the north prior to the eleventh century. Second, the fact that the Zhang family, as a Han-ethnic group living under the Khitan Liao regime in Hebei, followed the most fundamental system of traditional Chinese tomb-making suggests that they would have followed the cultural conventions of the late Tang and Five Dynasties in general. 24. As is the case with many other seasonal customs practiced in the Song dynasty, the celebration of Qingming seems to have occurred at the same time and maintained a similar form over the centuries in China, all the way up to the present. Usually beginning in early March in the lunar calendar (early April in the Gregorian calendar), Qingming traditionally began the day after Hanshi, a three-day holiday that started on the 105th day after Dongzhi (which marked the winter solstice), as is still done today. During the season, numerous kinds of festivities were carried out; although the descriptions in Dongjing menghua lu are primarily of imperial events, they do give a tangible sense</page><page sequence="22">22 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART of the ways Qingming was celebrated, and these were certainly - at least on a visual level - part of ordinary peo- ple's lives.

See Meng Yuanlao, Dongjing menghua lu, juan 7, p. 43. 27. As one of the best-known legendary figures in Chinese folklore, Zhong Kui was also an important exor- cist. The oft-cited story from the lost Tang yi shi (Unrecorded events in Tang history) recorded in the thirteenth-century text goes as follows: Tang Xuanzong (r. 712-756), bedridden due to an illness, encounters a small demon in his dream, who apparently caused the illness. Suddenly a huge, fearsome demon appears and captures the small one; he scoops out the small demon's eyes and then devours it. He then introduces himself to Xuanzong as a figure who in his mortal life failed to earn high honors in the civil-service examinations and killed himself. But then he was posthumously awarded imperial honors by the second Tang emperor. Deeply moved, he in return became a vanquisher of demons to protect people from epidemics. Awakening from the dream, Xuanzong ordered the renowned painter Wu Daozi to paint an image of Zhong Kui based on his dream vision. Greatly pleased by the image's close similarity to what he saw in his dream, Xuanzong awarded Wu Daozi a hundred pieces of gold.

Yi Yongwen suggests that "Nan Hetan" was likely the stage name of an actor; several post-Song texts mention "General Tan" (Tan jiangjun as a character, which would have derived from the stage name Nan Hetan.

Attentive to its close connection to shen, which could refer to "(great) spirits" or "deities," I translate gui here as "lesser spirits." In other contexts, especially when used independently, I translate gui as "demons" or "ghosts," depending on the context. Although the Mengliang lu is a record of the city life of Hangzhou, written slightly later than Dongjing menghua lu, judging from the fact that a substantial part of this text overlaps in content with Dongjing menghua lu, it is reasonable to retroactively project this passage back into the Song period. 31. As a general editorial pattern, subtitles of each sec- tion (juan) about seasonal customs in Dongjing menghua lu (from juan 6 to juan 10) begin with the largest seasonal category that applies to the events that would occur during the season, and one section often includes several seasonal markers. For instance, Lichun and Yuanxiao jñW are introduced in the section that begins with Zhengyue IE H (January). Dongzhi (the beginning of November in the lunar calendar) opens the last section of the seasonal cus- toms, in juan 10; and the last seasonal category appearing in this section - and the entire text - is "Shi er yue," under which the above-discussed subsection, Chuxi, is introduced. 32.

The historical development of the discourse of judgment in hell is hardly linear. For example, one of the two ramifications of "demon (Mara)-kings" (mowang $tī) that appear in the early-fifth-century Lingbao SS Daoist scripture Lingbao wuliang duren shangpin miao- jing MMMM&amp;Á-hè (Wondrous scripture of the upper chapters on limitless salvation from the numinous treasure ) already suggests a similar role of the kings to those in the Buddhist discourse of Ten Kings of Hell devel- oped as late as the tenth century. In the Wondrous Scrip- ture, "demon-kings" appear as either judges who decide the fate of the dead, or testers who examine the mettle of adepts seeking transcendence. See Kamitsuka, "Ma no kannen to shõma no shisõ." For a concise historiography of the publication/circulation of the Wondrous Scripture , see Richard von Glahn, The Sinister Way: The Divine and the Demonic in Chinese Religious Culture (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2004), p. 156. For a study and translation of this text, see Stephen Boken- kamp, Early Daoist Scriptures (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), pp. 8-10; 373-438. Given the conceptual conflation of the terms mo and gui during the Six Dynasties, especially in the arenas of Buddhism and Daoism, the structural parallel in the role of judge for the dead between the Lingbao Daoist discourse and later Buddhist discourse of the Ten Kings is telling. It is a topic that goes beyond the scope of this paper, and deserves a separate study. 35. Based on Dunhuang manuscript S. 2630, Soymié has pushed further the connection between the "Cui pari guari" in the painting and the historical figure Cui Ziyu by tracing relevant anecdotes, novels, and dramas in which the figure appears as a pariguan . In the Dunhuang manuscript, Cui Ziyu appears as the hero, who visits hell and sees Tang Taizong; see Wang Zhongmin et al., "Tang Taizong ruming ji" (Record of Tai- zong of the Tang entering the netherworld), Dunhuang bianwen ji Jjd (Record of transformation texts found in Dunhuang) (Beijing: Renmin wenxue chumanshe, 1:957), pp. 209-15. His personage and history reappear, somewhat altered, in the popular novel Xiyou ji ¡SIS IB (Journey to the west) in the late Ming period. In some of these anecdotes, Cui Ziyu is sometimes referred to as Cui fujun BHÇïî (Officer Cui), a character that survives into the modern era in a pantheon of popular religion. Though most anecdotes and fictional narratives derive from post- Song-period sources, the association between Cui pariguan and Cui Ziyu is generally accepted. For examples and detailed arguments, see Michel Soymié, "Les acolytes de ti-tsang (II)" (Acolytes of Dizang Bodhisattva [II]), Arts Asiatiques 14 (1967): 141-70; Yoshida Ryuei lÉfESPIill, "Cui Ziyu to Cui fujun shinkõ" I (Cui Ziyu and religious beliefs in Officer Cui), Shükan Tõyõgaku 29 (1973)' i04~I7; and Huang Zhengjian fflE it, "Guan yu Tang Song shiqi Cui fujun xinyang de ruogan wenti" (Some aspects of the beliefs in Officer Cui during the Tang and Song periods), Tang yanjiu n (2005): 295-312. 36. With variations in number, such individualization of each pariguan appears in other paintings of the same period; for a detailed discussion about this, see Matsumoto Eiichi , "Jizõ juõ zu to Inro bosatsu" iÉH+IH (Painting of Jizõ with Ten Kings of Hell and Inro Bodhisattva), Kokka Hìjl 515 (1933): 266; and Les arts de l'Asie centrale: La collection Pelliot du musée Guimet (The arts of Central Asia: The Pelliot collection at Musée Guimet) (Paris: Reunion des musées nationaux, 1:995), v°l- 2&gt; P- 3°4- For discussion of the literature and discourse of the Ten Kings, see Stephen Teiser, The Scrip- ture on the Ten Kings and the Making of Purgatory in Medieval Chinese Buddhism (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1994). 37. The level of localizability may be contingent on the extent to which we can identify the other magistrates with historical figures, which remains to be further investigated. Regardless, the strong implication of the locality itself differentiates the socialized magistrates from the deified ten kings. One may argue that some of the names given to the ten kings also reflect the localization of the kings, since several of them bear names derived directly from tra- ditional Chinese terms, such as Taishan wang ;feiil3î, as opposed to Indian-rooted terms. However, the "locality" of the magistrates that I am emphasizing here sharply differs from that level of localizability. By having common sur- names of people, rather than names of mountains or other places, the magistrates depicted here are characterized as human officials rather than terrestrial or celestial ones. 38. Soymié demonstrates that the term pariguan was also used in Daoist texts for designating the clerks of the netherworld; see Soymié, "Les acolytes de ti-tsang (II)," 146. At a popular level, the term pariguan itself could also refer to many things, including a magistrate assisting the Ten Kings of Hell, an assistant civil official of the God of Fire (Huo shen ^c#), or the demonifuge Zhong Kui; see Da Fang, "Zhong Kui gushi de yanbian," p. 18. 39.

At a basic iconographie level, the role types as well as the makeup and props of the characters are similar to those of the tomb's twofold performance: blue-faced char- acters as grotesque musicians and a white-faced actor as an official who uses a bamboo stick as a means to control demons. There are also many other segments and char- acters described in the poem, which the author seems to have chosen to depict in order to focus on audio-visual aspects. Although we cannot know the entirety of the performance, it is worth noting that visual and theatrical elements similar to those in the Dongjing menghua lu account appear in this poem. 44. Little is known about the life of Liu Tang. With no surviving texts by him available, a brief account about him and his poetry, by his nephew Liu Xun (1240-13 19), is the only source. According to this scant account, he was an erudite Confucian scholar locally active in Nanfeng, Jiangxi province; see Liu Xun, "Xueguan lingxing men zhi" (Outstanding scholars and officials), in Yinju tongyi, pp. 742-45. 45. Although no example has survived from this time due to the perishable nature of the material, paper talismans depicting individual deities were in wide use during the Song. Just before the Lunar New Year, ordinary folks would purchase prints of deities and lesser spirits at the market and paste them on their house doors. See Meng Yuanlao, Dongjing menghua lu, juan 10, p. 61; and Da Fang, "Zhong Kui gushi de yanbian," p. 18. This anthropologically universal phenomenon was well documented in China by early texts such as Wang Zhong's īft Lun heng fiitī (The balanced inquiries ); see Lun heng (Shanghai: Shanghai renmin chubanshe, 1974), p. 247. Note that the prints depicting what are known as "door gods" (men shen FW) were only a part of a variety of talismanic images used at the entrance to a house. Among numerous studies on talismanic images or objects on doors, see Mary Fong, "Wu Daozi's Legacy in the Pop- ular Door Gods (Menshen) Qin Shubao and Yuchi Gong," Archives of Asian Art 42 (1989): 6-24; Wang Zijin Menji yu menshen chongbai (Rites at doors and the worship of door gods) (Shanghai: Sanlian shudian, 1996); and Wang Shucun žEfXÍfct", Zhongguo nianhua shi (A history of New Year's pictures in China) (Beijing: Beijing gongyi meishu chubanshe, 2002). 46. I use "self-awareness" in the sense that Victor Stoichita characterizes metaimages; see Victor I. Stoichita, The Self-Aware Image: An Insight into Early Modern Meta-Painting (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 15. 47.

The time associated with this particular activity may not be evident here, but when this image is seen together with murals of other tombs in the same cemetery, it is clear that the sutra writing was associated with morning. 49. Hsueh-man Shen, "Body Matters: Manikin Burials in Liao Tombs of Xuanhua, Hebei Province," Artibus Asiae 65, no. i (2005): 133-34. 50. Hsueh-man Shen's observation of the sense of separation between the two chambers resonates with the dual temporality pointed out here. Shen characterizes the antechamber as full of noise and busy movement by the pre- parers of the ritual, while the rear chamber was a tranquil space for cultivating the body; see ibid., p. 133. 51. Wu Hung, The Art of the Yellow Springs , p. 233. This mural also corresponds to the content of the epitaph that describes Zhang Wenzao as a man who mastered all three religious teachings; see Hsueh-man Shen, "Body Matters," p. 136; and Li Qingquan, Xuanhua Liao mu, pp. 221-30. 52. According to Hsueh-man Shen, underlying this particular treatment was a reconstitution of the body for continuous living after death; the Buddhist-originated prac- tice of storing cremated ashes in a statue was adopted for realizing the Daoist ideal of cultivating the body for post- mortem immortality. Li Qingquan further traces the ritual origins of the hybrid practice to a Khitan burial tradition; see Li Qingquan, Xuanhua Liao mu, pp. 262-73. Wu Hung, focusing primarily on the aspect of ritualizing the body, defines the second procedure of the treatment - storing the cremated ashes in a mannequin - as deriving from the Confucian practice of ancestral worship that em- phasized honoring the corpse, as well as the time-honored use of cypress wood to make Daoist protective figures; see Wu Hung, The Art of the Yellow Springs, pp. 142-46. 53. Judging from the fact that the Zhang family was a group of revered local elites, the rather shockingly hybrid manner of body treatment, especially to modern scholars' eyes, would still have been a form negotiated through social norms. The "restoring" aspect of this practice was</page><page sequence="25">JEEHEEHONG • Exorcism from the Streets to the Tomb 25 even further emphasized in other cases such as the manne- quin of Zhang Shiqing (in Tomb No. 1), which bears a lifelike face of the deceased with individualized traits; see Hebei sheng wenwu yanjiusuo, Xuanhua Liao mu, vol. 1, p. 223. A few similar types of mannequins were found in another group of tombs in Xuanhua and in Beijing; see Zhangjiakou shi Xuanhua qu wenwu baoguan suo et al., Xuanhua Xia ba li er qu Liao bihua mu kaogu fajue bao- gao ÄibTAM II (Archaeological report on District No. 2 of Xiabali, Xuanhua) (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe, 2008); and Li Qingquan, Xuanhua Liao mu, pp. 262-83. 54. It is unlikely that the exorcist image was designed to act against the spirits of the deceased. The roles in the tomb space, of those ranging from the classical exorciser Fangxiang to all kinds of the so-called tomb-pacifying figures (zhenmu yong/shou üllfi /S£), boil down to the expelling of harmful spirits, never the spirits of the tomb occupants. Unlike living quarters, where exorcisms were conducted to drive away wandering spirits of the dead, the tomb was the place to which the spirits of the deceased legitimately belonged. The exorcist image would be to protect the deceased, rather than quell them. 55. See Tian Rucheng, Xihu youlan zhi yu (Superfluous touristic records of a journey to West Lake), juan 20 (Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 1998), p. 294. Having traced the genesis of the pan'guan and his characteristically liminal ontology, we can better interpret the term gui in its later compound form, guipan ; rather than simply meaning the judge who himself is a ghost, it reflects the liminal quality attached to him, and hence means "ghostly." 56. For example, Xu Yingqiu Yuzhi tang tanhui (Forest of discussions from the Hall of Jade Mushrooms), SKQS ed., vol. 883, juan 12, pp. 296- 97. For a Yuan drama where guipan appears, see, for ex- ample, Zhusha dan dishuifuou ji (Loads of cinnabar and dew under the eaves), in Guben xiqu congkan bianji weiyuanhui ed., Guben xiqu congkan si ji lÉf^fjcŮllŤÍJEIll (Collected early editions of ancient dramas, ser . 4), series 3, Maiwang guan ļjļcStJ® edition, vol. 23 (Shanghai: Shangwu yin shu- guan, 1958), ia~36a. 57. The other tomb in the cemetery with a lifelike mannequin of the deceased is the tomb of Zhang Shiqing (Tomb No. 1), but, unfortunately, the tympanum on the south wall in the antechamber had already been damaged when it was excavated, and we cannot know what might have been painted there; see fig. 52 in Hebei sheng wenwu yanjiu suo, Xuanhua Liao mu bihua SfbiZllfltH (Murals of Liao-dynasty tombs in Xuanhua) (Beijing: Wenwu chu- banshe, 2001).</page></plain_text>
