<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Grene AESCHYLUS: MYTH, RELIGION, AND POETRY' In 405 B.C. Aristophanes produced The Frogs, a play of rather extraordinary literary criticism to have been shown before a large popular audience. The plot is something like this: the god Dionysus, whose statue occupied a place in the theater (we might now describe him as the patron saint of the drama), is going down to the Under- world. His aim is to bring back with him to the upper air a "truly creative poet"-tragic poet, it appears (gonimos poietes). Those that are left in the profession and alive, he says, are no good. So he must bring up one of the three great dead, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. At this time Aeschylus had already been dead for more than fifty years, and Sophocles and Euripides had died the year before the play came on. It was clearly a moment of review, in which the comedian, a comparatively young man himself, looked back on the great century of Attic tragedy. For reasons which are partly obscure and partly too long to enter into here, Aristophanes decided that he would not involve Sophocles in his play. The god Dionysus makes Aeschylus and Euripides, as the most opposite of opposites, compete for the role of the truly creative poet, and his reward, the return to the upper world. In the competition, each of the competitors, 'This essay is the revised form of a lecture that was presented at Northwestern University on February 22, 1982. ? 1983 by The University of Chicago.

The plot of the comedy demanded that the "creativity" of the truly creative poet should be shown by the goodness of the kind of citizen which his works had helped produce. Aeschylus in justifying the role of the writer says in this play, "Children have schoolmasters and young men the poets." Athens in 405 B.C. was fighting for her life, besieged by the Lacedaemonian League led by the Spartans. The city fell, and the defeat of the Athenians was made absolute just about a year later. So the morale-and the morals-of Athens is looked at in the light of the long years of the century before and during the First and Second Peloponnesian Wars, when Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were conditioning the people to be what they have now become in 405. At least, that is what the god Dionysus is supposed to think. Moreover, both of the competitors, especially Aeschylus, are made to explain whether or how their tragic plays had made men into the good soldiers that at this moment the Athenians must be. Most of the comedy, however, is given over to a minute and technical examina- tion of the kinds of poetry, the kinds of verse rhythms, the kinds of images that made the two rivals effective in their trade of educating and delighting-and the relation of all these means to what could be called truth or reality. In The Frogs, Aeschylus places himself in the long list of poets of Greece who in their several ways have served the function of improving their auditors and readers. Among these he mentions Homer-though, interestingly enough, after Orpheus, who taught men mysteries of religion and abstention from bloodguiltiness, Musaeus who gave cures for diseases (besides oracles), and Hesiod who treated of agriculture.2 "From what source does divine Homer derive his glory and distinction save that he taught men good things-the ranks in battle, deeds of bravery, the arming of soldiers?" Then, after a comic interruption from the interlocutor, the play goes on: "He (Homer) taught many other brave men, too, including the hero Lamachus, and from these [both Lamachus and others and Homer as a general background] my mind [says Aeschylus as speaker] took an impression [or mold] [apomaxamene] and I created in poetry many deeds of bravery done by Patrocluses and lion-hearted Teucers, that I might rouse the citizen to stretch himself in competition against such [antekteinein] when he hears the trumpet of battle."3 A little later in 2 Aristophanes, The Frogs (Batrachoi) 1030-36. 3 Ibid., 1039-42. 2</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions the play, the importance of the style of language spoken by Aeschylus's heroic figures comes up. Aeschylus is defending himself against Euripides' criticism of his style, which he describes as in general bombastic and unintelligible. "You wretch," says Aeschylus, "a writer must create words and phrases [hremata] which are the equals of his great judgments and great thoughts."4 Let us disregard Aeschylus's immediate rhetorical purpose, as Aristophanes presents it-the making of Athenian citizens into better soldiers. More and better soldiers are needed; that is what should win the prize of ascent to the upper air for the poet chosen. But let us concentrate on how this Aristophanic Aeschylus describes his inspira- tion and material in writing a tragic play. First, it is not Aeschylus but "his mind" (heme phren) which is at work on the raw material. This is somehow important. He is speaking not of a wholly personal act of creation in fiction, but of an almost impersonal interaction. Second, "his mind" looks to the Homeric poems (we must add, in view of the Aeschylean plays we possess, that it looks also to the current myths of not so definitely literary origin) and from this and certain real historical characters "takes an impres- sion." The word apomaxomene means to take an impression in clay or dough and is used elsewhere also of a sculptor taking an impression. Note also that there is a real historical component in this from which the impression is taken-the soldier Lamachus and certain others who, says the Aristophanic Aeschylus, also were inspired by Homer themselves. (There is admittedly a historical difficulty here as far as Aeschylus goes. Aeschylus could never have known the famous Lamachus except as a small boy, if at all. This does not bother Aristophanes. I suppose from his distinguished place among the dead, Aeschylus has as much right to know of Athens's great soldiers during the last half century after his own death, as he has to know the wickedness of Euripides' plays, most of which were also produced in the same period.) Third, from this "impression" the poet "created" certain acts (in plays) that could be attributed to generic heroes- Teucers and Patrocluses (the plural is important in emphasizing their generic character)-so that the ordinary citizen "should stretch himself in emulation against" such heroes. Lastly, the language which fills these designs with substance must be as great as the "thoughts and judgments" which belong to the work. The use of this Aristophanic presentation of Aeschylus is to make us take a more understanding account of the role of the imagination in Aeschylus's tragedies and our effort of imagination in receiving 4 Ibid., 1058-60. 3</page><page sequence="4">Myth, Religion, and Poetry them-how we stretch ourselves in emulation of the models to see their significance. It does not do to treat comedy as though it were a philosophic argument in which each joint of the discussion is to be examined. But there is enough in this, which is how a particularly acute Athenian poet saw the artistry of the senior Athenian tragedian of the fifth century, to make us pay a lot of attention to it. Especially as it has a curious kind of correspondence to what any twentieth- century reader must feel to be the most striking feature of Aeschylus's tragedies-his inspired use of archetypes in character and event, derived from myths in literature or elsewhere, and his re-creation in dramatic poetry of the living moment of the impact of the archetype on the present and now-his and ours. The "mold" must imply, I believe, an intense concentration of effect into an enforced shape. In turn this shape is Aeschylus's inspiration and control in the creation of "all manner of brave deeds." It is the intermediary between his raw material, in myth and history, and the play itself and in especial the movement and words of the actor. And it is perhaps the Centaur-like blend of myth and reality in the mold within the play which fills the great thoughts and concepts with a language unexampled for vivid and brilliant contortions of ordinary grammar, meaning, and construction. The archetype or archetypes which underlie the Aeschylean play are, we feel, like a cast taken from elemental life, coming to him through the myth but not necessarily identical with the myth. Some- times it is a character, or a moment in a character's existence, which grafts on our own deepest fantastic experience the backing of some mythical event derived from some dubiously recorded past. In handling the myth story in the Agamemnon, Clytemnestra and the murder of her husband are bound to be the centerpiece of the plot. The archetype indeed does inhabit this scene with terrible power. The queen speaks: I stand where I have struck, over the death accomplished. I so brought it about-I'1 not deny it-that he could neither escape nor defend himself. I railed him round, with this cloak so rich, so evil, a limitless net for the fish. I struck him twice and with two groans his limbs relaxed. He lay there fallen. I dealt him yet a third in honor of the God Underneath, Hades, Safe Keeper of the Dead; that blow was my grace-prayer. So he lay, gasping out his life, and as he spirted out the sharp stream of blood, he struck me with the dark drizzle of red drops. I rejoiced no less than the sown ground rejoices in the bright rain of Zeus, when the plant buds are bursting.5 5 Aeschylus, Agamemnon 1379-92. 4</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions The metaphor of the sown earth is intrusive, assimilating the mythic scene to dark terrors. But the directness of the words and their simplicity of description almost realistically fuse the murder and the sex act. It unites the unfulfilled frightfulness in our minds with the evil fiction in progress on the stage. The vividness of this is personal, grotesque, horrible. It is also entirely of the world of fantasy. It is an archetypal imaginative experience. Such archetypes are the stock in trade of myths, since the myth is the story that links together such evocative units of passionate response. Though for the myth itself we can hardly ever pin down a single author-and it is doubtful if there has ever been one-the impression the mythic archetype creates is something the same as the work of the greatest individual artists. When Aeschylus gets hold of a myth that stirs his genius, each of the archetypal scenes or situations gains a clarity and sharpness, somewhat akin to the breath of life that enters the face or form glimpsed by a novelist and makes the fictitious character vital in itself. But it is a myth Aeschylus has got hold of, and therefore it is an archetypal scene or situation which assaults us with a power naturally far greater than that of the single novelist's imagination. Again, the archetype may be different from the human-superhuman Clytemnestra. It may be an archetype of another kind as in the Prome- theus story. There are really two mythological stories of Prometheus, one dealing with his theft of fire and his gift of it to man, the other involving the contrast of Prometheus (Forethought) and Epimetheus (Afterthought). Aeschylus has combined the two, removed Epime- theus, and made the Prometheus trilogy the archetypal story of man's beginnings and survival in the world. And for this, Forethought, his name, seems to sum up his dramatic function. But he is man, like us, and suffers as we would do as he is shackled on the rock by Might and Violence. If one reads the cast of characters-Forethought, Ocean, Daughters of Ocean, Might, and Violence-one might con- clude that the play is a simple allegory. If one listens to some of the speeches one might think it a drama of human characters borrowing allegorical names. But anyone who responds to the play realizes that the archetypal story is for Aeschylus neither an outline nor an allegory that he fills out with poetry. The myth becomes the text, creating itself at the moment of enactment, with poetry appropriate to its transformation. This includes both words and theatrical effects. The hammer strokes which are described and mimed, as Prometheus is chained on the rock, are as true, original, and vital as the figure of the Hellenic savior of mankind himself. The blows are as much part of the living drama as the great speech which Prometheus delivers to those elements of the world not yet committed to his enemies: "Airs 5</page><page sequence="6">Myth, Religion, and Poetry of the heaven, swift winged breezes, springs of the rivers and the numberless laughter of the sea's waves."6 Prometheus is not Fore- thought destined to play-a part in a totally dictated story, like an antique Pilgrim's Progress. Action has been replaced by narration, but that narration is conditioned by the prisoner's loneliness and his inevitable retrospection and prophecy. The theatricality of the scene is such that, as Prometheus relives the past for his auditors and suggests the future, the scope of the play never loses touch with the dilemma of the presenter that is at the root of the play's "meaning." The past of man and the destiny of man, the past of Zeus and the destiny of Zeus are not past and future only; they are dramatic in the words of one of the two protagonists and in their reception by Io, the Oceanids, and ourselves. We are also alive in Prometheus's suffering, since it was his pity which gave man a stake in the game (man who sits in the audience) when the other God, Zeus, would have ended it with our obliteration. We live moreover in the suggestion that further changes in our lot depend on the ability to suffer and survive as Prometheus does and as lo does as she moves to settle new continents and people the known world with different races. The myth itself is new and alive in its theatrical image. Visual clarity superimposed on grotesqueness of form is the key to much of the shock in Aeschylus's dramatic life of the myth. Sometimes this is physically expressed on the stage, as when the priestess at Delphi crawls on hands and knees from the shrine to meet the audience, overpowered by the terror of seeing the Furies in the holy place, or when the black robed forms of the Furies themselves writhe, moaning under the haunting of the nightmare ghost of Clytemnestra. Sometimes it is in details of verbal description, as when Apollo forces us to listen to the account of the tortures that, he says, are the appropriate scenes of the Furies' attendance, instead of Delphi: "Hence get you gone, out of my house.... It does not befit such as you to draw near it. Your dwelling is where heads are struck off, and eyes gouged out; where the manhood of the young is maimed in the destruction of the seed; where nails are torn off and men are stoned to death; where is the piteous moaning of those that are impaled."7 Sometimes it is in a single phrase such as the great douleias gaggamon ates panalotou.8 This, literally "the great net of slavery, an all- capturing ruin," is sometimes translated "net of fate," which might seem just a metaphor, slightly jaded. But there is something remark- 6Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound (Promitheus Desmotes) 88-90. 7Aeschylus, Eumenides 179-90. 8 Aeschylus, Agamemnon 360-61. 6</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions able here. The word gaggamon elsewhere occurs only in Oppian, a writer on fishing. It is glossed as meaning "shrimping net" or "oyster net." There is apparently something in the shape or meshes of this particular net that drew Aeschylus to see it as suitable to describe slavery and, in apposition to it, ate (infatuate ruin) "which captures all." The effect must have been as if we were to refer to "Fate's lobster pot." The myth, then, as Aeschylus transformed it into theater is the reenactment, with new and sudden overtones, of a moment universal and mysterious. But the myth sequence, that which constitutes the trilogic plot, is the archetypal image of process in the cosmos and of history among men. Aeschylus received the myth of the succession of Ouranos, Kronos, and Zeus, the despot gods that have successively controlled the universe. But these are not simply names of rulers that follow one another. Between Kronos and Zeus there is the break between the Old Gods and the New. How the Old Gods and the New should be divided literally (historically and factually in Greek pre- history) we are very far from certain. Aeschylus's divisions may probably correspond to the division between the Greek gods (new invading deities or gradually encroaching deities) and the Old-gods that were in possession when the Greeks came. There is quite a lot of doubt about the origins of some of the gods, on either side of the divide. However, as far as the myth in Aeschylus goes, after Kronos's subjugation by Zeus, the Old Gods made their last assault on the new ruler. And Prometheus, one of the Old Gods, changed sides. He changed sides because his mother, Themis-Ge (Natural Law and Earth), told him that the day of violence was over, that henceforth victors will be victors by craft, by wisdom, by knowledge supporting endurance-not by strength. Prometheus tries to convince his brethren of this, but fails. And so he goes over to the new forces of the world and helps them by the quality which his name implies-Forethought. However, he does more. Out of gratuitous pity, he grants a form of this personalized quality (forethought) to the despised other creation, man. Zeus, on resurveying the universe after his accession to power, has decided to destroy what man was and create something new instead. The chorus of Oceanids, having learned how, in general, Prometheus had baulked Zeus's plans for man, engages in the follow- ing dialogue: Ch. Did you perhaps go even further than this? Pr. I did. I stopped mankind from seeing their doom, ahead. Ch. What cure did you find for that disease? Pr. Blind hopes. I sowed in them blind hopes. 7</page><page sequence="8">Myth, Religion, and Poetry Ch. Great indeed is the blessing, the gift you gave to man. Pr. And besides, it was I that gave them fire. Ch. And do these creatures of a day have bright-faced fire? Pr. Yes, and frorfi that will learn all manner of arts.9 Prometheus's decision to help man exists, in the eyes of Zeus, in a dangerous context: he is a former friend who as kingmaker in the past may very well become the maker of a king other than Zeus in the future. Prometheus also shows himself possessed of another secret of destiny, his knowledge that Zeus may perhaps not always be domi- nant. The word Forethought is stretched to cover a multitude of aspects of what is mental, rather than physical, both in earth and heaven. Most remarkable, it is made to cover the kind of secondary version of itself that implies the denial of the first. It is through not foreknowing that mankind's blind hopes lead him to ordinary fore- thought. Prometheus as embodied Forethought grants and denies in order to effect the final desirable transformation of the concept, as it functions in the human world. Of this Prometheus trilogy we have only one play, which with some assurance we regard as the first of the three. The second and third, of which we have only the tiniest fragments, apparently dealt with Prometheus's release and final reinstatement in honor. This is brought about, as far as we can gather from hints in our text and very small support from fragments of the other plays, by some symbolic conces- sions made to Zeus in the form of a substitute victim for Prometheus, a rescue by Heracles, the descendant of Io, and Zeus's capitulation to Prometheus's threat implied in the knowledge of Zeus's possible supplanter. Although this is a very rough sketch, it illustrates how Aeschylus draws together the events of the story so that their signifi- cant interaction is due to certain principles that appear from the complex latencies of the myth. Such principles as, for instance, the disappearance of violence as the significant effecter of change. It is, of course, highly ironic that Zeus, the new god who succeeded largely through Prometheus's sense of the new order of craft, himself tries to break down Prometheus through the agency of his own daemons, Might and Violence. Aeschylus looks at the myth, looks at the living and historical methods of the Greek tyrant, takes his cast or impression, and creates his "acts"; in this last he blends his general conception of Prometheus, in the myth, with the physical presence, voice, and person of the actor and his verse and dramatizes the archetypal passions and archetypal 9 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound 246-54. 8</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions principles of dominator and victim as he has seen them between myth and historical reality. Zeus in the Prometheus is a Greek tyrant. But he is also the godhead that can only find a comprehensible image in the tyrant-and, we are finally to discover (in Prometheus and in the last stage in the Oresteia), in the evolving tyrant, the tyrant who becomes a monarch with settled laws. Man, as we understand man, could not have come to pass without rebellion and without the minor deity's, our champion's, willingness, out of pure pity, to act as our partisan. Thus it is the course of opposition by our champion, the long struggle and eventual compromise, that leads to whatever is good or typically human in our lot. It is emphatically not due to a beneficent providence. All of this means that Aeschylus saw the historical and political process, visible and comprehensible in human life, as mimetic of the order of events in the cosmos. And this includes the spontaneous and casual extending of personal pity during the political process. From man to gods there is a continuum of power, at each stage subject to hampering limitations, largely connected with the accessi- bility of knowledge. Man is weak before the gods-but one of the gods has invested man with some new attributes, which once granted apparently cannot be recalled, and this has given him a new identity. Man's future now also contains a mastership of all the earth, over which his primal ancestress Io will travel and produce its different breeds. Prometheus is Forethought. He was able to thwart Zeus's plans at the beginning. But he is now also Zeus's victim and must be imprisoned until he can blackmail his tyrant successfully to release him, and until Io's descendant appears as rescuer. Finally, Zeus himself, we are told by his agents at the start of the play, is all powerful, but as it turns out, he is not master of his own future. The relevant dialogue occurs when Prometheus denies the present possi- bility of his release to the Daughters of Ocean: Pr. Not yet has Fate, that brings all to fulfilment, decreed that it should be so. No, with ten thousand agonies and piercing pains I must be twisted, as I am now, before I shed my chains. Art is far weaker than Necessity. Ch. Who is the steersman of Necessity? Pr. The three-formed Fates and the remembering Furies. Ch. Is even Zeus weaker than these? Pr. Even he cannot escape what is decreed to be. Ch. But what is decreed for Zeus except eternal rule? Pr. This you may not learn yet; do not seek to know it.10 0 Ibid., 511-20. 9</page><page sequence="10">Myth, Religion, and Poetry Not only does power, specialized and incomplete, stretch from man, to gods, to its last resting place in Fate, but this power, insofar as it is conceived of as vested in personal agents (that is, in all except Fate), is destructively fettered by ignorance. It is because Zeus does not know the detail of Fate's design that Zeus must eventually surrender to Prometheus. But Prometheus does not know what the torture can be like until he endures it, and therefore there is always the chance that he will give in. Man lives on his blind hopes to carry out all his ventures toward the mystery of death. Fate is never entirely under- stood by either God or man. Fate is the convergence of all the currents-the rhythm of the universe itself, the will of the gods, multiple or sometimes single, and finally the actions of men them- selves. It is haunted by potentiality also, in the Greek view-the crossroads where the taking of one track instead of another rearranges all the factors involved. The end of this track is the last moment of final weighing, as Zeus ruefully is forced to conduct it in the Iliad, in regard first to his own son Sarpedon and later his favorite worshiper, Hector. 1 The concept of process in Aeschylus is something like an image of time itself. But the ending of the single units of the process both in divine and human terms constitutes history. The victory of Zeus, the third god in the sequence, is the final mark of such a unit, though there is a hint of the danger to its finality in the threat of Prometheus. In the case of man, the end of such a unit in series is a historical event. This has a clearer and more immediate definiteness than anything that has preceded it in the myth. It is true, of course, that myth and history can, for a Greek, come close together when so much that is historical is vouched for by traditional memory. But the myth is, nonetheless, different from history. It is something a little more universal than a recorded event, some link with a past transfigured and extraordinary. History is more "realistic," more like what is singular, more vouched for. The Areopagus as a court existed in Aeschylus's day, though he does not really know about the circum- stances of its institution. In the Oresteia, its first trial ever is described. The goddess Athena is its chairman, the defending lawyer for the accused Orestes is Apollo, the plaintiff the Furies. For all that, the theatrical audience is seeing before it a court and a courtroom procedure which is part of ordinary Athenian life. The creation of the Areopagus is exhibited as one aspect of the settlement of the huge issue of purification and responsibility that goes back to the struggle of the Old Gods and the New, and through them to the primacy of ' Homer, Iliad 16.430-61; 22.167-87. 10</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions male or female in the society-the Old Gods are female, the New Gods male. The myth in Aeschylus may be looked at as a funnel growing narrower and clearer as the historical event and the known historical entity impose their single reality on the potential multiplicity of the myth. The myth in Aeschylus's plays, unlike the myth in the plays of Sophocles and Euripides, consists explicitly of the greatest religious and human issues, seen almost abstractly, while the details of charac- terization and event are realistic. In Sophocles, for instance in Oedipus the King, the hidden values of the incest and patricide, above all the counterplay of what Oedipus knows he is looking for and what he is afraid he is looking for, powerfully reinforce the plot of the play. By degrees we are overwhelmed by the coexistence of the plot structure, the acts before our eyes, and a deeper level of the story that is assaulting us simultaneously. But the plot, at its direct level, is complete and perfect of itself. It is the story of a man who through seeming good luck, courage, and brains attained everything he wanted, avoided everything he wanted to avoid, and ended by seeing that every step he took away from disaster brought him toward it. That is the story and we respond to it basically in exactly that sense. It is quite right that Aristotle in his specifications of the proper hero of tragedy should speak of a man rather like ourselves, destroyed by an error or hamartia-quite right that Aristotle makes clear that the Oedipus is the best kind of tragedy. Sophocles, to give substance to his tragic vision, rendered his play in hard spare poetry, with very little in the style that is exaggerated or fantastic. By contrast, none of Aeschylus's figures are simply tragic figures in the dramatic plot: not Prometheus, not Io; not Clytemnestra or Cassandra; not Agamemnon or Orestes. They are all super size. They all speak for the huge thoughts and concepts they represent or involve. They have a unique grip on our minds because they themselves are imaginative projections, which stand outside of the play's story-or rather, to adopt a sentence of W. B. Yeats, they stand gesticulating before the curtain of the story. Aristotle's definition of the tragic hero as a man like ourselves is certainly not one to apply to them. And the Aeschylean plot takes us at once into the additional meaning it possesses for us the audience, over and above our concern with the "who loses and who wins, who's in, who's out" of the story. Prometheus is the champion of man, who has made of man something better than a brute; he is himself man, in that he must suffer. His "forethought" is godlike, but it is limited by the human defect that torture when experienced is different from the torture anticipated with forethought. All the issues of his saving of man and the nature 11</page><page sequence="12">Myth, Religion, and Poetry of knowledge in him and us become alive directly we watch or read. Clytemnestra in the first play of the Oresteia, the Agamemnon, carries on her the shadows of the Furies who will represent her in the last, the Eumenides. Her terrifying femaleness, dominant over her victim husband and her no less feeble lover, are part of our conscious experience of the confrontation of the Old Gods (female) against the New Gods (Olympian and male). If we read in succession our one play of the first trilogy, the Prometheus, and the full three of the Oresteia, we find evidence of the religious vision of a single thinker that is like nothing else in Greek literature. Many scholars refuse to look at the four plays together; they say there is a separate background of thought for each of the trilogies, often reinforcing this in finding the Zeus of the two sets of plays fundamentally incompatible as witnesses to a single religious position. Neither of these difficulties seems to me overwhelming. It is, on the other hand, perhaps fair to object that we should take account not only of these plays but also of the other plays of Aeschylus if we talk about his religious position. Still, these two trilogies are certainly concerned with a single topic-man in his origin and development as conditioned by his direct contact with the gods. The conflict of the Old Gods and the New is most important in the background of the Prometheus. It is a fight that is finally settled in Athens at the end of the Eumenides. Zeus and Prometheus in the context of fate is a question that pervades the Prometheus. It is settled at the end of the Eumenides where the play ends, "And so the will of all-seeing Zeus and Fate have come together."'2 Granted the difficulties of integrating the other plays of Aeschylus with the two trilogies, as the other three plays deal with quite different questions, my restriction to the two trilogies at this time is perhaps reasonable. We do not have positive evidence for the dating of the Prometheus. The Oresteia is written in the last years of Aeschylus's life-460-59 B.C. The Prometheus Bound is variously attributed to any one of the last ten years before his death. The first trilogy, the Prometheus, deals with man as he enters his new and human as distinct from his half beast stage. It is seen entirely through the eyes of the deviser of man's rescue, who is now suffering for his act in his punishment by Zeus, man's would-be destroyer. The second, the Oresteia, takes a single incident from history, a mythical history, the murder of Agamemnon by his wife and that wife by her son, as crucial in its implications for Athenian society-perhaps for human society as a whole. These implications are rooted in religious purification, which for the Greeks 12 Aeschylus, Eumenides 1045-46. 12</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions is indispensable for all the civil and social life of the state. If Orestes can be purified of matricide by Apollo, the representative of the New Gods, the Furies as Old Gods have lost their jurisdiction. This jurisdiction embraced all homicides committed among people of kindred blood. Thus the Furies hunt Orestes to the death, because son is allied to mother in blood, while they remain indifferent to the murder of Agamemnon by his wife because this pair is not blood related. The trial then involves the conflict of Old Gods against the New, under the chairmanship of Athena, the establishment of a change in the possibility of purification, the pleading of a new importance of male over female because the male is the only true parent of the child and to him the child's duty is owed, and finally the setting up of a human jury to determine the facts and significance in cases of murder, rather than to have the whole matter decided by the automatic claims of kindred bloodguiltiness. But the enmity of the Furies, if they are openly degraded, is a thing greatly to be dreaded. So the end of the Eumenides sees them ensconced as a new kind of supervisory authority over morals, though no longer as a power of direct and immediate enforcement of bloodguilt based on blood tie. This settlement is, of course, represented by the court of the Areopagus. And in this particularization, the end of this great abstract all-human issue lies with Athens, the Areopagus, and the alliance of Athens with Argos, which was a contemporary political interest in Aeschylus's day. Thus a movement which started among the gods, in their fundamental division of Old and New, ends with the solid history of the Areopagus in Athens, the reception of the Furies, and the Argive alliance. A kind of superhistory of man and the world this is-but not a proper cosmogony, nor does it contain a real eschatology. Apart from the sequence of Ouranos and Kronos and finally Zeus, who is the governing power when we see Prometheus for the first time, we have no glance at cosmic beginnings. There is no origin in time, no Hesiodic myth of theogony, no creation of the world. Just as surely there is no permanent and all-solving end at the last in the Oresteia. The court of the Areopagus, the new title of the Furies (Eumenides), the Argive alliance are all, however glorious and however revelatory, things of a moment, though this moment may be prolonged for a decade or a century or two. In a special sense for Aeschylus, process, as process and as change, has taken over the meaningful cosmos. What has taken place among the gods exists as it can be understood in human analogy, an analogy of human history and politics. There is no proper beginning that can be reenacted, no proper end toward which things can be revealed as moving. As there is no true understanding without experiencing, 13</page><page sequence="14">Myth, Religion, and Poetry suffering the event, there is no proper foreknowledge. Zeus is compre- hensible, I think, through both trilogies, though comprehensible with more difficulty, and less strictly relevant evidence for comprehension, in the second series than the first; but the universe is not solely and certainly not entirely directed by Zeus. The finality of the individual units of change or even the possibility of change lies in a necessity or rhythm that is greater than Zeus-the design of Fate. Something else emerges as we look at the religious position estab- lished in the Prometheus trilogy. We are not seriously in the presence of the Olympian gods as we know them from Homer. In Prometheus Bound there is Zeus the dictator offstage. On the stage his only associates that we see are Hephaestus, the unwilling god of fire forced to forge Prometheus's fetters, and Hermes, Zeus's "running footman." Both are very small roles. Zeus's other servants are Might and Violence, one of them a muta persona. Their names are important; these are merely embodiments of abstract qualities. In the rest of the cast, Prometheus's friends or doubtful friends included, we have Ocean and his daughters, and it is to the natural powers of the world (wind, waves, etc.) that Prometheus appeals as he goes down to his new rocky grave. Everything in the play concentrates on the elemental and un-Homeric. We do not of course expect Zeus to appear-he never does on the Attic tragic stage-but it is remarkable that his anthropomorphism turns simply into the spirit and genius of tyranny, evolving under threat into something more like a settled monarchy. The god who made man what he is and Io who is the ancestress of man, as she moved round the world breeding the races of his kind, frame all that is important in the expansion of the theme of the tyrant versus the rebel god. Io is the first of these forces for change that is female, to be followed by the more fully humanized Clytemnestra and Cassandra and the divine Furies. First and last, man is the center of movement in the Aeschylean universe. It does not matter that he counts for little on the theological scale. He is the issue which splits Zeus and Prometheus. It is a descendant of Io who will deliver Prometheus. It is Orestes whose purification is crucial to the ultimate relations of the Old Gods and the New. The interaction of god and man is the key to the developing universe, and change and development is that universe in its observable expression. Finally, and perhaps most remarkably, it is through man's eyes that Aeschylus permits us to see the evidence and the validation for the Zeus of the Oresteia-the Zeus who has evolved from the bullying tyrant of the Prometheus, the Zeus whose "will has at last come together with fate." 14</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions The Oresteia is, in itself, a trilogy concerned with the evolving godhead, though in it the stress is on how man deals with his need of the different sorts of god. The Prometheia-to give its proper title to the trilogy of which we have only the one play-has a complete cast of gods, only lo's being dubiously human. But again it is the change in the gods, their evolution, that is important, both in the division of god from god (the Old Giants from the New Zeus) and in the change in Zeus himself, who is driven by Prometheus's threats to compromise, while Prometheus makes certain small concessions. And it is man whose interests cause the split and to some extent cause the change in the godhead. In one speech of the chorus in the Agamemnon, we seem to start again from the same moment as in the Prometheus Bound. In the first lines we learn again of the succession of the three despots of the Divine World, with Zeus triumphant. But now much time has gone by-if the concept of time is what we should add to the equation. Anyway, Zeus has become a settled, legal sort of monarch whose decrees about the quality of human life control us. In the person and through the eyes of the Old Men of Argos left behind Agamemnon's expedition to Troy, we are looking at the meaning of the evolved Zeus, now no longer new, as our supreme interpreter-not necessarily absolute ruler-of man's destiny: In the ancientness of our flesh we have no honor; we have been left behind the expedition then; we prop our strength on our staffs, a strength that is a child's. When the marrow is young, it leaps in the breast, but that is the same as the strength of old age; Ares dwells not in that country either. And the overold, in the parching of the leafage walks its three-footed way, no better than a child, it wanders, a dream in the daylight ...13 Zeus, whoever he is, if this it is the name he cares to be called by, this do I call him. I cannot find likeness of this to that when I cast all in the scale, except for Zeus, if in very truth I must throw from my heart its vain burden. Not He that was aforetime great, burgeoning in daring, all challenging, 13 Aeschylus, Agamemnon 71-82. 15</page><page sequence="16">Myth, Religion, and Poetry shall even be spoken of, as being of old. And He that came after has met his triple-fall wrestler and is gone. But the man that cries the victory song with a full heart to Zeus shall have all, all that his heart craves. Zeus it is who set the road to man's feet, the road of learning through suffering. He it is who made this law valid. There drips before our heart instead of sleep an agony of suffering remembered, and against our will comes the sense of wisdom. Truly these gods enthroned on their solemn thrones- their grace comes with violence.14 Prometheus in bondage discovered the secret of wisdom-that fore- thought is not truly thought till the event adds its component to the thought in the head. This has now become Zeus's decree: "He it is who set the road to man's feet." Prometheus learned this first in person: "Of knowledge I offended, I will not deny it. Through helping mortals I found my affliction. But I did not think that with such punishment I would wither away on these towering crags."'5 However, Zeus the evolving tyrant has also learned the lesson, the relation of knowledge to the moment of experience, and he has now set it as the principle laid down for the guidance of man's life. In the myth that he treats, Aeschylus lays hold of a story with deeper meaning than any that can be constructed fictionally out of any writer's single experience. Alternative meanings lie hidden in the myth in semicompleted form. Aeschylus's newly created image is something that takes over the existent story or character from some flash of mutual recognition between him and the myth. He has grasped it in the moment of truth-whatever the moment of truth may be that has spanned the ages of difference between the myth's emergence and himself. He galvanizes some latent aspect of the myth, of passionate concern to his own day, and, wonder of wonders, very often to ours. This is the archetype-of figure, of situation, perhaps even of time and history. When he re-creates the myth, he sees it and hears it in the setting of actor's body and actor's voice; true life is in it then, at last. Whether the myth in its original form emerged in some similar way, but left us only with a sketch on our lips, who can know? 14 Ibid., 160-84.
