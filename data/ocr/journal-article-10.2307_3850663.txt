<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews J. E. CHAMBERLIN Poetry Chronicle THERE IS A KIND OF ELEGANT ambivalence about mankind's useless en- deavors, and those who engage in them often display a nice blend of promethean paranoia and feline self-satisfaction. John Hollander has woven a complex and entertaining tale' out of the resemblances between the craft of the poet-who we have always known makes nothing hap- pen-and the art of the spy-who is, as Hugh Trevor-Roper, among others, has recently assured us, the most perfectly useless of men. It is a nice fiction, and what is especially delightful is the rich display of mirror images which Hollander's reflections on espionage reveal. First of all, there is the wonder of the exercise, of writing things that ostentatiously are something before they mean anything, of discovering how That code itself, the purest form of language Thrills the enciphering mind; putting the plain Sense into travelling garb is a kind of Singing. And until They change the codebook, my Eleven seems a kind of measure fit for Reaches of feeling as wide as any mode's. There is much of the diffident assurance of Robert Browning here, and especially of his poet-prophet-prince Sordello, blended with an affable Augustan confidence in continuities, in cultural breeding. Providing en- ergy to the enterprise is a zealous attachment to its purity, to its ultimate exemption from normal categories of experience, an attachment that brings to mind the aesthetic obsessions of the turn of this century. Cer- tainly Hollander's master-spy, whose code-name was Cupcake, has the flickering aesthetic delicacy of the Imagist, as he sends many of his most appealing messages (through Control, of course) to the agent Image, about whom nothing is known. The one insight which eliminates the bother of any tedious justification is that both the poet and the spy operate in closed systems, in which life and art (or craft) do not exactly merge, but reinforce and reflect each other, and in which the cover of the spy (the persona or mask of the artist) reveals the true self, as the "false self reflects back a real image" when "cover and work . . . embrace without touching." Indeed, some spies, as some poets, 1 REFLECTIONS ON ESPIONAGE, by John Hollander. Atheneum. $8.95.</page><page sequence="2">J. E.

Ultimately, the hope is for one of those flashes Of understanding that would allow all the Scraps and pieces and anxieties of the Planning to catch fire all at one.

Crowned only with a muss of hair, Barely wrapped in the muffled tatters of my Mute bathrobe I stare out at the gray early Morning traffic groaning down its avenue. The paranoia of the compulsive outcast, of Prufrock and Mauberley as well as Melmoth and Pierrot, is a part of this portrait, with the city replacing the wilderness in an unmistakable manner. The world in which Hollander's fiction is set is essentially a reflection of the consciousness and attitude of a fairly defined time and place, when the "altogether inconven- ient little republic which ceased to exist a good time ago" flourished after its fashion, and when European theories Revealing the brotherhood of prophecy And encipherment were particularly fashionable. This brotherhood has since become se- verely divided-hermeneutics and structuralism and so forth-but the spirit prevails, and the compelling fascination with encipherment is linked with imaginative speculation. The work in which the agent Cupcake is engaged is a continual struggle against being found out, against unwary routine, against false confidence. We must keep asking for Ciphers more difficult, each month, to use, lest Our care and hope vanish into the message, Coding having become too much a matter Of sighing, flopping into one's chair ...

One way, the true and paradoxical way, of shunning this madness is by embracing the significance of the obscurely constant and the constantly obscure, by subverting trivial expectations and expecting the trivial to be subversive, by playing casual games with purposeful intensity. We are left with a final menace, the irony of perpetual solipsism, of losing oneself in the hall of mirrors that Shelley described in Alastor. Cupcake was warned in Training ... about absorption In the observed image which might as well be In a mirror. And he is acutely aware that As with the life, so ridiculously, with The work. But, after all, which of them is the Enciphered version of the other one, and Are we, after all, even supposed to know? Questions of cause and effect, distinctions between real and imaginative, problems of time and space . . . these inform all processes of transforma- tion, all creative functions. Cupcake's confusion is no different from Wallace Stevens'; somewhat exasperated by efforts to decipher a first cause for emotional and artistic activity, Stevens told a correspondent that he "felt very much like the boy whose mother told him to stop sneezing; he replied: 'I am not sneezing, it's sneezing me.' " Cupcake sneezes his way, or is sneezed, through interminable encipherments until he reaches a point at which invention and discovery merge, and the self merges with its creations in a message to the Aeolian Lyrebird. Beth Bentley2 is also intrigued by correspondences and reflections, exemplified by Andrew Marvell's image of "the Mind, that Ocean where each kind / Does streight its own resemblance find," and conditioned by a world in which we resume our imaginary lives, smiling at our visions, given shape and substance by a mirror ("The Mirror") 2COUNTRY OF RESEMBLANCES, by Beth Bentley.

CHAMBERLIN The motifs of Bentley's volume are provided by the apparently in- dispensable Martin Buber, by the ubiquitous Chuang Tzu, and by that perpetual sneezer Wallace Stevens. The quotation from Chuang Tzu with which the second section of the group begins sets the tone. Now he does not know: is he a man who dreamed he was a butterfly or a butterfly who dreams that he is a man? There are some nice explanations of this notion in the volume, such as "The Poet at Seven," in which an expression of anger precipitates a confused realization of its origins, its possible independence of the self yet its certain reflection of the self. Anger. Anger like her mother's. But she felt no anger, seeing her friend's red face, only wonder at what she'd done. And wonder as she learned her mind was a hidden place, deep as grass, thick as the scent of peach-blossom, quieter than sky seen through branches; a quiet into which she moved, swimming down, down, down through dark waters toward trees, beasts, changing weather: the place her self lived. It waited for her, the country of resemblances. Carl Jung, a distinguished geographer of this country, once remarked in an introduction to the Taoist Secret of the Golden Flower (translated by Richard Wilhelm in 1929) that the process of intuitive ordering of experi- ence is "first projected and expressed in forms furnished by the experience of organic life, that is, as fruit, embryo ... This fact could best be expressed in the words 'It is not I who live, it lives me.' " Bentley's interest in what Stevens (in an epigraph she employs) called "a muddy centre before we breathed ... a myth before the myth began" leads her to one of the most powerful and elemental of Greek myths, that of Demeter and Persephone. Her treatment is rather schematic, to be sure, but the instincts are fair. Above all, the mother liked order . .. In the garden, her rows lay straight, tomatoes facing south, corn in clusters so as to pollinate. The bees and winds did as they were told; I II</page><page sequence="5">THE HUDSON REVIEW days followed in proper sequence; months were schooled. There was no rebellion. Even the vegetables consented, seasonably, to being eaten. But the daughter liked her chair to face the window one day, and the next to face into the room. She liked doors swinging open, especially on windy days, and sometimes at night. Moonwort, tall and purple, turned up among the daughter's onion sets, and rows meandered one into the other. When she should be weeding, she was dreaming in the shade, or standing in the river shallows. She was fond of exploring the woods, where people had disappeared- the daughter liked mysteries. ("Mother and Daughter") Walter Pater suggested that "no chapter in the history of the human imagination is more curious than the myth of Demeter, and Kore or Persephone." James Frazer saw it as "one of the few myths in which the sunshine and clarity of the Greek genius are crossed by the shadow and mystery of death." Persephone's story is, in a sense, an intense version of the story of Adonis, of Hyacinth, of Adrastus, of the Sleeping Beauty. She is the goddess of summer, and the goddess of death; and Demeter's grief is poignant and selfish. The confusion with the myths of Dionysus, Cybele, Attis and Pan (who in the guise of Marsyas pipes to Cybele to console her for the death of Attis) are many and profound, and provide the story of Demeter and Persephone with rich and disturbing associations and possi- bilities. William Carlos Williams touched on one aspect in Kora in Hell; most recently, W. S. Merwin has given a complex version in a poem entitled "Kore." Beth Bentley, though she has chosen only one theme here, might write a powerful and compelling sequence out of her per- ception of the myth and her sense of its implications, for her genius appears also to be crossed by shadow and the mystery of death. Her present volume, as a whole, is without the cohesion and focus-and therefore without the power-that mirrors and resemblances could give to a different kind of poet. There are fine possibilities, but curiously re- pressed. Derek Walcott's new volume3 is a rich collection of poems, which displays the author's humor and sensitivity in a wide range of pleas- urable inventions and striking images. 9 SEA GRAPES, by Derek Walcott. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. $8.95. 112</page><page sequence="6">J. E. CHAMBERLIN The ancient war between obsession and responsibility will never finish and has been the same for the sea-wanderer or the one on shore now wriggling on his sandals to walk home, since Troy sighed its last flame, and the blind giant's boulder heaved the trough from whose ground-swell the great hexameters come to the conclusions of exhausted surf. The classics can console. But not enough. ("Sea Grapes") Walcott does not offer consolation, but the kind of resolution that Stevens talked about in "The Man on the Dump," where "one sits and beats an old tin can, lard pail," and in the end, one always comes to this: to the dock, the rain hazed horizon and the corpses of poems. ("Frederiksted Nights") There are several notable elements in these poems. Some consist of a celebration of endurance, whether of people or places: old men like empties set down from morning outside the almshouse, to let the rising evening brim their eyes, . . . .. .Whatever it is that leaves bright flesh like sand and turns it chill, not age alone, they were old, but a state made possible by their collective will, would shine in them like something between life and death, our two concrete simplicities, and waited too in, seeming not to wait, substantial light and insubstantial stone. ("Frederiksted, Dusk") Other poems sparkle with refreshing scepticism and a lively wit, not without its chill. Then after Eden, II3</page><page sequence="7">THE HUDSON REVIEW was there one surprise? O yes, the awe of Adam at the first bead of sweat ... Adam had an idea. He and the snake would share the loss of Eden for a profit. So both made the New World. And it looked good. ("New World") There are also unsettling interludes, such as those in which Walcott illuminates, with sly skill, some relationships between fictions and lies, and sheds some disturbing light on the complex obligations of the poet: but in the black markets lizard-smart poets selling copper tributes changing skin with the tribe and the tribe still buys it the dreams and the lies ("Dread Song") At what point must we mistrust our fictions, our language, our images? One grows to hate these things except on the dump. Or in "Sainte Lucie": O Martinas, Lucillas, I'm a wild golden apple that will burst with love of you and your men, those I never told enough with my young poet's eyes crazy with the country, generations going, generations gone, moi c'est gens Ste. Lucie. C'est la moi sorti; is there that I born. Walcott is a fine poet, knowing finally that he may even understand the contract between the galloping lion and the stunned doe; there is some yes to terror in her eyes. What I will never understand II4</page><page sequence="8">J. E. CHAMBERLIN is the beast who writes this and claims the centre of life. ("Force") David St. John's first volume of poems4 is filled with fine touches, clever images, elegiac tones, but flawed by poor connections, unenticing discon- tinuities, and unnecessarily coy moments: ("I vowed to take up my affair with your mandolinist. I took off my silence, and my coat; and I waited for you.") The opening poem (taking as its inspiration a poem by the Polish writer Tadeusz R6zewicz) introduces a poet whose invitation is to a somewhat macabre and unevenly metaphysical realm of fictions. This is the light, I said. This is the light, and the day ... Here; I pointed. A newsman whose tongue is a rancid almond. A machinist whose ears drone like sirens. Your own twin, looking for a street sign. A girl, slipping her hands under your shirt. No, he said. Go on. These are my hands, that drag a knife through meat, that stack crates in warehouses, in trucks, that whisper like thieves in dark offices, that twist an icepick into your temple, that hold a woman's face. Yes. What else. Nothing else. Or this: that some days, the letter you wait for comes; that the light is blowing into the hallway- as you open the door, and step out. You're lying, he said. Go on. ("This") Whitman rampant, with gules. Rozewicz once noted that an image or metaphor "does not speed up but rather delays the reader's encounter with the true meaning of a poetic work," and St. John is adept at sustained encounters ... though he is not yet quite so good at conveying true meanings. I might add that his literary touchstones are also in this 4 HUSH, by David St. John. Houghton Mifflin. $6.95; $3.95 paperback. "I5</page><page sequence="9">THE HUDSON REVIEW mold, but more successful at "only (un)connecting." St. John's most poignant poems are his most private ones, such as "Naming the Unborn"; his most interesting approach the surrealistic, such as the scheme of "Four O'Clock in Summer: Hope," after a painting of that title by Tanguy in the Raymond Queneau collection in Paris. When he controls his affecta- tions ("loneliness means having / Your gin neat . . . and risk is just a ve- hicle of faith") and commits himself to some one kind of poetic relation- ship to his subject, at least for enough time to master it, St. John may well be a fine and consistent poet. Raymond Queneau would I suspect like to be ushered in the back door in this way, and suitably there is in a series of poetry translations from the French that have recently been published an excellent selection of Queneau, well translated by Teo Savory.5 Queneau's poems must be fiendish to translate-with their profusion of fabricated words, rhymes, phonetic devices; and dislocations of words, lines, meanings-but Savory does a fine job.

Translated by Teo Savory. Unicorn Press. $10.00; $4.00 paperback. i 6</page><page sequence="10">J. E. CHAMBERLIN A poem's just a little thing The Queneau volume is published by the Unicorn Press, which has also published translations of a variety of works in French and German, as well as the work of well and little known writers in English. It is a venture that is well worth noticing, for there are some pleasant reminders and delight- ful surprises, and the volumes themselves are presented with taste and individuality-neither always entirely to my liking, but with an admirable sense of purpose and evidence of consideration. One of the most intriguing of the present group is a translation of Guillevic's Euclideans,6 a wittily anthropomorphic presentation of geometric design and poetic reification. The hyperbola, for example: To be not only this hollow, but also these two long graphs which never finish up by being lines that are really lines, to know that this can happen only in infinity, which must be a myth, a lost region. -Must one be asymptote even in infinity? At the other extreme, the equilateral triangle: I've gone too far with my obsession for order. There's no future in it. There is one volume in the packet that came from the Unicorn Press that I should especially like to mention; a first volume by Michael Hogan, entitled Letters for My Son.7 Several of these are poems written about or from prison, and they all display a keen poetic insight, an attention to the details of the imaginative life which is remarkably sure in spirit; and though at times Hogan is unsure in execution, his shortcomings have a poetic side to them. 6 EUCLIDEANS, by Guillevic.

I "7</page><page sequence="11">THE HUDSON REVIEW My little boy, no longer small, writes to me as a stranger writes. Had all those kitchen miles of crawling led West, he would be here. Had I lingered there handcuffed by love, regret perhaps would not lie thick as the soap ring in her sink. Today he writes and wonders why it was I left and there is no emotion, no sense of loss, merely curiosity- a question a bright child might ask like: why did biplanes have two wings and no easy, circular reasoning, please. The answer, not terribly important to him, should still be true. ("Letter from My Son") Celebrating the arrival of spring, Hogan creates a particularly effective and lasting image: Above them a tower guard dips his rifle then raises it again dreamily. He imagines a speckled trout coming up shining and raging with life. ("Spring") Miriam Waddington8 is capable of sensitive writing and of fine effects, and her poetry is often marked by a delicately vicious self-consciousness. I stand alone in the great anteroom no use now even to be afraid there is no one to be afraid to anymore. ("Ending") This poem is one of a powerful sequence of "darkening snapshots of (the poet's) dead husband": my mother said, with a marriage like that it's plain curtains 8 THE PRICE OF GOLD, by Miriam Waddington. Oxford University Press. $3.95. II8</page><page sequence="12">J. E. CHAMBERLIN for simple you- Well it was curtains in a way for a while for me; but for him it was curtains too and for him forever and for always. ("Wives' Tales") There are some dangers in this kind of poetry, to be sure, and the temptation to be cleverly obvious is one that Waddington enjoys risking. What diminishes the effect of this game, and of its serious implications, is an irritating tendency to try to be overtly serious, to be universally significant, to discover ultimate truths ... as for example discovering in such unlikely places as rocky earthbound faces, the eternal lineaments of the transforming lover. ("Artists and old chairs") It is possible to make this discovery, of course, but not easily in this poem about chairs. And it is difficult to work up much enthusiasm for this kind of spiritual gymnastics on a caesura's notice. Our ghosts sit there and stare ahead, this year the people are not kind; their eyes are fixed on the lake of the dark trees they do not see each other. They sit on the stone bench they do not see each other, each one is looking inward and each one is continually taking the photograph of his own ghost ("The dark lake") Waddington writes out of a belief (in Gertrude Stein's word that provide her with an epigraph to a section on "Living Canadian") that every one is as their land is, as the climate is, I9</page><page sequence="13">THE HUDSON REVIEW as the mountains and the rivers or their oceans are ... This is about as true as a poetic statement ever is; and although Canadian poetry undoubtedly reflects the consciousness that its environment creates, I see little future in the interminable behaviorist orgies of provin- cial self-discovery that this environment and some of its besieged in- habitants seem inevitably to encourage. Stein also spoke of there being "more space where nobody is than where everybody is" in the New World. Miriam Waddington is at her best writing of those spaces where nobody is, except sometimes somebody's shadow. Revealing the hand with its signs and its wonders writing bird beak and claw writing ice mounds and ages whose writing has summoned from the caves of green light from the flowing of water the shadowy figures of those who come after and their shadowy laughter ("The cave") Grace Schulman9 has a sure instinct for images that inform the romantic sensibility, for the importance of returning to the village where forests are spirals of fire, to climb narrow roads and find that pine torn by lightning, its branches holding stares of needles that strain the sky, pointing upward, stiff as hands in prayer.

CHAMBERLIN crossing the river that drives through rocks and sings in my blood, treasure of my being ("Recovery") What she does not yet have is a sure sense of what I would call voice and mood, of the relationship of the subject to the action, and the func- tion of the poetic statement with respect to both. Even without meeting these conditions, however, she achieves lines curiously sharp in outline. I have established my chapel in water. I would move through mountains. But fathers, Let me return to a safe harbour; like the waves' Slate-sheets, crash in the jetties of your arms. ("Burn Down the Icons") One especially intriguing element in Schulman's poetry is her use of the paradoxes of imaginative metamorphosis, of forms changing yet remain- ing the same, of energy that creates and destroys, of love that famishes the receiver as well as the giver, of transformations that are intensifications, of surfaces that are profound, of effects that are causes. I pray to Proteus, the god of change And proteolysis, 'the end of change Changing in the end' To break old images and make you new As love is its own effect unendingly. ("Surely as Certainty Changes") This is somewhat pedantic, perhaps; elsewhere the images take on more life: our air is flung With forms that change; We burn on air as fire feeds and kills, As water becomes ice or vapor, As sun moves all things, We manage mountains, Altering horizons. ("Morning Song") Or the forces are personified with a kind of classical humor. 121</page><page sequence="15">THE HUDSON REVIEW See me in the glaze On a leaf, in the skin's Iridescence, have me in luminous Reveries; light turns into me. I preside the sea: waves harness My force. I am lightning Flashing; I am the lair Of all change that is life. My road is various; an alternating blaze; I generate and destroy, Feed what I devour, Burning on air. ("Metamorphosis") The consistent use of the image of fire in this volume makes for a powerful kind of continuity; and Schulman's control, her surprising lack of self- pity, augur well. She plays with paradoxes as though they were meta- phors, and with metaphors as though they were paradoxes, seeming to know that both are the same, and gorgeous nonsense, as she "immolate(s herself), betraying friends / ((her) enemies), decoding messages"... a nervous Cupcake trying to find Lyrebird's frequency. Peter Redgrove'1 is an accomplished hunter of snarks. It is lechery, lechery: fits and starts, Grabbing and gluttony, while the sightless worm Like soft successive links of a spring Wants to pile out and slubber for hours In the moist slow shade among the twigs And damn the birds! in this slithing time. ("A Leaf from my Bestiary") The poems in this selection of Redgrove's work are quirky and disturbing, and many of them are very fine indeed. Some are poems of loss, of waste- from a Frostian lament for a boy who lost his hand to a hungry saw, to a reflective "walk on the waste-ground for no good reason": I crash a puddle up my shin, Brush a nettle across my hand, And swear-then sweat from what I said: Indeed, the sun withdraws as if I stung.

CHAMBERLIN Looking as it would feel now, if I walked back, Across the carpets of my home, my own home. ("For No Good Reason") His invitation is to share in a sense of the force and the fury, the beauty and the fear, of the world that "attends (us) / Like a friendship." He introduces us to "Dr. Faust's Sea-Spiral Spirit": It changes places With Job continually ... It is the last trumpet And the first trumpet. It fashioned Glastonbury Tor With helical fingermarks. And his descriptions of the nature of organic forms and unseen but clearly perceived growth are nicely worked. Always he has a good eye, and a human compassion. Grown-up idiot, see the slow-motion of him, And that slow-motion sludge of a tongue Coiling along its stream of happenings ... Thereafter he was to wander With a hesitation at either elbow And a little free-wheeling spittle Through a kind of pastoral ... ("Decreator") Redgrove is deceptive; his sometimes trite phrasing is often reiterated with compelling skill to create fine moments. Hours late we walk among the strewn dead Of this tide's sacrifice. There are strangled mussels: The moon pulls back the lid, the wind unhinges them, They choke on fans, they are bunched blue, black band. The dead are beautiful, and give us life. The setting wave recoils In flocculence of blood-in-crystal, It is medusa parched to hoofprints, broken bands, Which are beautiful, and give us life. The moon has stranded and the moon's air strangled And the beauty of her dead dunes sent us up there Which gave us life. ("The Moon Disposes") His creative mind is restless, nervous, anxious, always fidgeting-his friend "had hair that was / tangled and scurfy, you / could work a radio 123</page><page sequence="17">THE HUDSON REVIEW on so much detail." A drop of rain becomes "a terrestrial globe for nobody's inspection"; the "troubled horsetrough" in the same scene holds "a slightly vaster version of the sky." His surprises are splendid: Only underground, far beneath the exhausted soil the great rock still wings silently. ("From Love's Journeys") He has a fascination with what Pater referred to as "diaphaneite," with crystalline translucence and transparence, as a metaphorical condition of creative energy; and he would share with Victor Hugo and Aubrey Beardsley alike a belief in the grotesque as central to art. Redgrove is a disturbingly original and a genially frightening poet, and this book is full of some of his best work. My only cavil is with the undoubtedly well- intentioned but quite unnecessary introduction by Marie Peel. I do not much want to be told that Redgrove "recoiled also from the castration of knowledge with every sliver labelled for analysis rather than the living continuum he knew." I would rather read Redgrove, writing on "The Nature of Cold Weather": His teeth unclench and jaw tumbles Cheeks sink flat in jagged thaws Like the cracking of fledglings or of hands, And black branching cracks grow green and pimpled, And grass, not pleasure, skrimp-pins him to the ground. His withered limbs lie as short-ice in the grass, In ice-weals along the shaded bumps Drawn after his teeth and jaws, legs and lion-like head, Brain, spirit and crystalline reflection Along the chugging streams That feed on him and grow plush along their sides. The sun shines on the green meadows, The chines and valleys, tufts and hillocks Quilted with daisies and with buttercups, Misty with gossamer and pollen, And his heels drum in the stream As the playing children come. 124</page></plain_text>
