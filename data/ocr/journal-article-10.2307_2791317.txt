With Plate I-J. Archaeology: Channel Islands. Ayscough. The Use of Floodlighting in Archeological Photography. By Florence Ayscough. 00 The Austrians have a proverb: 'when needs mnust the Devil eats flies.' It sprang to my lips when confronted with the problem of photographing the schematic figure on the under side of capstone two, in the Dehus Dolmen, Guernsey. I knew that Col. de Guerin had discovered two eyes, a mouth, two hands, a circle, a straight line and a strange figure, which might be a weapon of sorts, to be scratched upon the stone, but by day they were very difficult to see; and to photograph them was out of the question. No one had ever attempted such a hopeless task and the only representation of the figure was the diagram drawn by Major Carey Curtis: see T. D. Kendrick ' Archseology of the Channel Islands,' p. 28. The only course open to me was to determine what could be done by night. The effect of carefully controlled lights was amazing. The Guardian of the Tomb, if such he be, seemed endowed with life and his expression became extraordinarily mobile. After many experiments my very able assistant and I evolved the following method of procedure: we ran two spot lights from the car (these being, of course, attached to long flexes), and after we had decided upon the most advantageous position for these lights, hung them upon two tall poles, A and B. The reason we used two lights instead of one was that we did not wish to disturb the shadows at the point where the join in the mosaic photograph must come. After the first exposure, A light was moved from left to right of B, then B was moved from left to right of A, and so on until all the neces- sary exposures had been made. We diffused the lights as much as possible with white muslin shades and kept them moving throughout the exposures to avoid 'streakiness.' In fact, the diffusion of the light is the most important and the most diffidult part of the whole business. It is impossible to avoid a certain unevenness of exposure, as in order to throw the faint scribings into relief the lights must be held practically on a level with the edge of the stone. The near edge is then over-illuminated, while the portions farther away do not get sufficient light. The result can, of course, be corrected to a certain extent by reduction of the negative, but from the nature of the case a perfect result is, I think, impossible to obtain. As, in the Dehus Dolmen, the ground is only six feet below the stone, it was necessary to use a wide angle lens, to focus by measurement, and to determine the absolute plane of the camera by rmeans of a spirit-level.. It would, I suppose, be possible to obtain a result by the use of flashlight, but we prefer to give a ten-minute exposure with fixed lights, as thus we can control the shadows and be sure of our effects. I have used this system of floodlighting for photographing erect stones and find it equally satis- factory, as many details, unnoticed by day, spring into prominence. The oblique light revealed in the Dehus a number of hitherto unknown workings on the stone. [ 93 ]</page><page sequence="2">PLATE I-J. MAN, JUNE, 1933. FiG. 2. FACE OF FIGURE.

In the first place, careful percussioin on either side of what are apparently natural ridges has produced a definite nose and heavy arched eyebrows. Secondly, careful percussion has been used about the mouth and chin where definite ornament is shown. The ornament seems to be a beard, heavier on the left cheek than on the right, which factor, combined with the circumstance that the distance between mouth and eye is less on the left side than on the right, gives the effect of a face slightly turned. It is interesting to note that this turning is towards the entrance. The figure seems to be watching anxiously. Thirdly, the wide portion of the stone was shown to be covered with typical dolmenic scribings. As in Brittany, each tomb seems to be decorated with some dominant 'motive,' so in the Dehus a certain hooked design predominates. As in Brittany, the meaning of the scribings is obscure, so in the Dehus are they unintelligible. One marking resembles the supposedly anthropomorphic designs on the standing stone at Carao, in Abamio, Spain, and it is possible-although doubtful-that the figure I refer to represents a man with his arms in the air. Le Commandant Octobon, author of ' Statues-Menhirs, Steles sculptees, Dalles grave'es,' is much interested in the photographs which I have sent him, and suggests that the figure carved on the under side of the Dehus Dolmen is of the same type as those at Collorgues, which latter he considers to be ' Guardians of the Tomb.' In any case the most important beakers at Dehus were found by F. C. Lukis in his excavations of 1847 (see 'Archweology of the Channel Islands,' p. 145) under this capstone beside a ritual pillar, rather like the one at Bryn Celli Ddu, which is also placed within the tomb. Miss Edith Carey suggests the possibility that this placing of an anthropomorphic figure in a horizontal position over the dead points to the early existence of a cult, possibly the prototype of that followed in the catacombs at Rome, where the portrait of Christ has been found placed in a similar position. (See ' The Times,' 24 December, 1932.) The Dehus Dolmen has lately been re-excavated by Miss V. C. C. Collum at the instance of Sir Robert Mond, and is now being repaired by the States of Guernsey. A fine peristilith has been laid bare, the tomb is being covered by a tumulus of earth, and electric light is to be installed. This will enable visitors to study, and possibly decipher, the scribings on the second capstone, while the unique and fascinating Guardian of the Tomb will then be visible by day. Guernsey is already noted for two unique monuments: the statues-menhirs of St. Martin de la Bellouse, and Ste. Marie de Castro; and now the Dolmen of Dehus will take its place as a third.
