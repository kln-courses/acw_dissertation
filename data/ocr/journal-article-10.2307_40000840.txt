<plain_text><page sequence="1">Priestesses of Hathor: Their Function, Decline and Disappearance* ROBYN A. GlLLAM 1. Introduction Of the few functional titles held by women throughout the long span of Pharaonic history, few are as celebrated or as seemingly ubiquitous as the designation hm.t ntr Hthr, "priestess (or more properly prophetess1) of Hathor." As we all know, Hathor is the goddess of love, childbirth and other "female" pursuits like song and dance. It is easy to imagine these priestesses wielding their sistra from prehistoric until Roman times. 2. Conceptual and Temporal Parameters of the title hm. t ntr Hthr Unfortunately, the reality is not so simple. Priestesses of Hathor flourish only from the middle of the Old Kingdom to the early Mid- dle Kingdom. After this time, the title occasion- ally occurs, held by such figures as Mry.t-imn, daughter of Ramesses II. However, we can be sure that these women have appropriated this along with other archaic titles to demonstrate political legitimacy and cultural capital. They no more represent actual duties and responsi- bilities than the archaic epithets held by Saite officials.3 Indeed, in this context, we should do well to remember Herodotus' statement that No woman holds priestly office, either in the service of goddess or god; only men are priests in both cases. This certainly seems to be true from the New Kingdom onwards when the most common ca- pacity in which female members of the elite served their gods was as smSyt or "musician priest- ess. As such they were members of a body known as the /mr which had existed at least from the middle of the Old Kingdom. For although these women could participate in the divine ser- vice by providing musical and choreographic ac- companiment, they could no longer perform the role of the hm ntr or god's servant, who fed and clothed the divine image every day. In order to play this role, a person had to be wcb or pure,8 * A version of this paper was read at the Annual Meeting of the American Research Center in Egypt, Toronto, 1994.

For example in P. Westcar XI, 18-19, Rudjedet purifies (wcb) herself for 14 days after the birth of her children. In the first tale of Setne, Ahwere, his wife, refers to her menstruation as her purification. Funerary curses, dating from the Old Kingdom, threaten those who enter the tomb in an impure state.11 It is possibly a euphemistic reference to urina- tion and defecation and suggests that, to the Egyptians, like other ancient peoples, bodily functions were unclean and created ritual danger in sacred spaces. However, this concern with purity also reflects the growing professionalizaton of the Egyptian priesthood over its history, which finally resulted in it becoming a closed caste for which one had to prove membership over several genera- tions. In the Old Kingdom and Archaic periods a different state of affairs prevailed. At this time, members of the ruling elite, very small in numbers, performed all the functions of government and cult without much special- ization. Cultic operations were organized, like other tasks, on a shift basis. Although purity was essential for performing the god's service (irt wcb), it was not always performed by one person all the time, so anyone who was pure at the time could perform it. It has sometimes been suggested that, even in the Old Kingdom, km ntr Hthr is merely an hon- ourary title or rank indicator, but clear proof of its actual duties is provided by a table of ser- vice drawn up for the 4th-5th Dynasty provincial administrator and overseer of priests (imy-r hmw ntr), Nkj-Cnh. This was intended to serve the lo- cal cult of Hathor Mistress of the Valley Mouth (td in.t) near present day Tehneh and the funer- ary cult of an earlier administrator Hnw-kj, a foundation originally endowed by Menkaure. In a pictorial table, Nkj-Cnh's wife and children are all allotted turns of duty at the cults of Hathor and Hnw-kj; and the contract quite clearly stipu- lates that they will perform wcb for Hathor.19 All such persons are therein designated hmw ntr}^ chc.n Rwddt wcb.n.s m wcb n hrw 14 Hpr pjy.y sw ir.n hsmn bw pw.y ir hsmn cn, (When) my time of purification happened, I did not make purification again.

If there is any doubt as to what this service entails, it is dispelled in the autobiographical inscription of the 6th Dynasty overseer of Priests of Hathor of Cusae, Ppy-Cnh Hr-ib. He states not only that he was in the condition (ra-c) of being wcb for Hathor (Urk. I 224.10), but specifically states that in his capacity of overseer of priests of Hathor that I entered (ck) before Hathor, saw her (and) performed for her the ritual (hr irt.n.s. ht) with my (own) hands. (Urk. I 222.2) Of greatest importance here is the use of the phrase try iht with reference to the actions of a private person in the service of a god. Before the New Kingdom, the daily cult of a god is seldom described as being performed by any- one else but the king. However, Ppy-Cnh's text reveals this as a necessary fiction and suggests that any purified person, even a woman, could enact the divine service. And women did serve in the cult of the gods. Apart from well over 400 hmw. t ntr Hthr known from the Old through Middle Kingdoms, they are known to have been the servants (hmw.t) of a number of other gods such as Neith, Pa- khet and the deceased Khufu. Priesthoods of gods like Thoth, Tjaisepef, Bapef and the liv- ing king were held by queens. Women at the temple of Min at Akhmim also shared with men the responsibility of keeping watch throughout the day and night hours. During the Old King- dom in particular, women's role in the central cult ritual was matched by greater participation in positions of authority than at later periods. Although these positions never match the power and responsibility of those held by men, they in- clude posts such as imy-r pr, imy-r pr snc, hrp wsht, shd sdjwt, sdjwty, or imy-r swnw. Admittedly, many administrative positions held by women reflect their responsibility for domestic activities such as clothing, linen, food preparation, and are wcb because they are not individually credited with the hm ntr title. See however, the statement in the last note, where the hmw ntr indicated are clearly the same persons listed in the table. See also Frazer ASAE 3, pls.

From the middle of the 5th Dynasty on- wards we also find them holding titles in con- nection with music, singing, and dancing, although it must be noted that prior to this time persons depicted in these activities were seldom named and were clearly not of the same rank as the women who held hm.t ntr and other, admin- istrative titles. There are also some men at- tested as holding titles connected with the hnr and they are often depicted as attached to it. While we have already noted a gradual dis- appearance of women from public life in the course of the Middle Kingdom, of which their removal from the performance of the daily cult is an important part, nothing is as dramatic as the disappearance of the hm.t ntr Hthr. Still well attested at the close of the 11th Dynasty, by the reign of Senwosret II, the position has all but vanished from the historical record. Oddly enough, it had appeared almost as suddenly in the mid-4th Dynasty. 3. Attestations of Hathor and her Priestesses to the 4th Dynasty The earliest firmly attested holder of the title hm.t ntr Hthr is Nfr-htp.s, the daughter of King Radjedef. On a statue base in his temple at Abu Roasch, she is described as hm.(t) ntr Hthr nb.t nht, Priestess of Hathor, mistress of the syca- more. No title holder can be safely dated any earlier. In fact, there is scarcely any textual attes- tation of Hathor at all that is any earlier than this. A handful of sealings displaying the titles hm ntr Hthr and hm ntr Hthr nb.t nht are assigned by Peter Kaplony to the Archaic Period. There is no mention of this deity on any of the inscribed Ibid., for example, imy.t-r pr, imy.t-r pr snc, shd pr snc, iry-c nsw, imy.t-r pr ssr, imy.t-r mrw. 61 Examples: Phr.t-nfr.tlBbi, Tomb of Ppy-Cnh, D4, Meir (Blackman, Meir IV, pl. 15); Hnw.t, G 3093 (C.

This last cited as a hnw.t by Galvin is not a musician; hnw.t is her name. The pertinent inscription reads: Hnw.t nist Inty, Hnw.t who is called Inty. This was correctly translated in the original publication. An early holder of the title mitr.t is Nfr.htp.s, Pelizaeus Museum 418 (H. Kayser, Die dgyptisches Altertumer im Roemer- Pelizaeus Museum im Hildesheim [Hildesheim, 1973] 47, colour plate 2). She is not, however, a priestess of Hathor. Nfr.s-rs, a 5th Dynasty priestess, is the earliest known female overseer of the hnr and ibw dancers (S. Hassan, Giza II [Cairo, 1936], 204, 208, pls. 78-79). After Phr.t-nfr.t, the next hnw.t and priestess of Hathor is Hnw.t, attested at Naga ed-Der (Dun- ham, Naga ed Der Stelae of the First Intermediate Period [Boston, 1937], 80, pl. 23). For examples where the hnr is referred to see Nord, Dunham, 137. H. G. Fischer, Dendera in the Third Millennium b.c. (Locust Valley, 1968), 24. In scenes where names are lacking, it is hard to know if labels on performers are actually to be read as titles or descriptions, e.g., depictions in the tomb of KSi-m-cnh (Junker, Giza IV [Vienna, 1940], fig. 9) shows ibj dancers and "singing by his children" (hs.t in msw.f) . In the tomb of Mrs-Cnh\\\ (Simpson and Dunham, op. cit., fig. 11) the deceased watches dancers and offering bearers who are depicted on the same smaller scale. See also R.

We first encounter the sign group Hthr written with the hw.t sign, hawk and t in the name of Nfr-htp-hthr, wife of Hcw-bjw-skr?8 This piece probably dates from the reign of Snefru, al- though it may be somewhat earlier. Although most scholars maintain that Hathor is an ancient goddess, known from the predynas- tic period, they refer to images that resemble her later manifestations, none of which are spe- cifically labelled. Most notable of these is the hu- man face with cows' ears and horns found on Arkell's so-called Hathor bowl,40 a fragmentary palette from el-Gerzeh41 and on the Narmer palette where it appears both as a pair at the top of the palette and on the verso as a beaded adornment on the king's loin cloth. A similar costume is also found on a fragmentary statue of Djoser from the Step Pyramid complex.43 From the Middle Kingdom onwards, this is one of Hathor's most characteristic manifestations, found on everything from mirror handles to monumental stone capitals in her places of wor- ship;44 and the Pyramid Texts45 obligingly tell us that "my kilt which is on me is Hathor." Henry Fischer has shown that this human-faced horned deity is also Bat, a goddess who, although iden- tified with Hathor as early as the Coffin Texts, enjoyed an independent cult into the Middle Kingdom and beyond. A similar figure de- picted sitting in a palanquin in a relief of the Archaic period, also noted by Fischer, is found on the front of the representation of Triphis. Our first unequivocal textual reference to Hathor is found on the facade of the valley temple of Khafre. In a pair of inscriptions on either side of the entrance, the king is said to be beloved of Bastet (north side) and beloved of Hathor (south side).49 Since the facade, with its two doorways is thought to represent the houses of Upper and Lower Egypt, the goddesses are obviously conceived here as the patron god- desses of either half of the country. Although King Snefru is associated with Hathor of the Syca- more by the construction of a mr.t temple for her and the consecration of a golden statue of her son Ihi within it, our only knowledge of this comes from the Palermo Stone, dated from the reign of Neferirkare. With the reign of Menkaure, Hathor and her priestesses rise to prominence. The famous triads which depict the king with the goddess and per- sonifications of selected upper Egyptian nomes identify her as Hathor, mistress of the Sycamore in all her places.51 Wns.t, perhaps a true princess, buried in G 4840, probably dates from this 38 Mariette, A2 (M.

As we have already noted, Menkaure was responsible for the foundation of the priest- hood of Hathor at Tehneh (RB-int), one of the new towns (niww.t mBBt) that seem to have been part of a scheme for internal colonization of this period. As well, we possess a number of cylin- der seals which describe Menkaure as "beloved of" and "one who worships" Hathor. Although similar seals survive from the reign of Khafre, their number is much greater under this king.55 4. Hathor, the Divine Kingship and its Relation to her Priestesses The rulers of the 5th Dynasty were even more enthusiastic in their devotion to this goddess whom they coupled with that of the Heliopoli- tan god Re. As well as benentting from the vast hecatombs which poured into the sun and mor- tuary temples which celebrated both of them,°6 Hathor had priesthoods in the mr.t temples of Userkaf, Sahure, Menkaure and Isosi.57 Her cult in the royal mortuary temples required priests as well as priestesses59 to do her service. This poses the question, just who or what was Hathor and what function did her service by numerous highly-born women perform for the theocratic regime of Old Kingdom Memphis? Studies of Hathor, which emphasize her connection with royalty and her function as a goddess of women, tend to synthesize material from different periods in a way that may be misleading and anachronistic. Edward Wente and Lana Troy, for example, have taken as their starting point texts and representations of the mid to late 18th Dynasty, when the king celebrated his cultic and regenerative potency through union with Hathor both as wife and mother. Not only did this thought complex give rise to funerary artifacts such as Tutankha- mun's golden chamber of rebirth, but it led to its real-life acting out with the chief queen, queen mother, and princesses all taking on a Hathoric persona to some extent.

Although Sinuheis fiction (and so for that matter is the tale of the three kings in P. Westcar) , Gabriella Scan- done-Matthiae has suggested that the scene in Sinuhe actually reflected cultic dramas staged by the rules of It-tjwy. Scandone-Matthiae also sug- gests that the jewelry and other personal effects of the princesses of the mid-1 2th Dynasty are not only gifts of the king but represent the costumes that helped them personify various aspects of divine royalty.6 Sj.t-hthr and SS.t- hthr-iwn.t were decked out in the cobra, sacred plumes, and lioness manifestations of Hathor; and their toilet articles were decorated with the sacred Bat head which Hathor had appropri- ated. Even their girdles were made so that they jingled like the sistrum.69 On the other hand, Hnm.t, the daughter of Amenemhet II, whose full name was Hnm.t-nfr-hd.t, "the one who bears the beautiful White Crown," was provided with a different panoply which featured the feathers and claws of the vulture goddess Nekhbet, the patron goddess of Upper Egypt. Hathor was at this time closely identified with WSd.t, the cobra goddess of Lower Egypt, in her capacity as the eye of Re.71 While Matthiae's arguments are suggestive rather than convincing, it must be noted that, with the accession of the 12th Dynasty, the office of priestess of Hathor is confined to a few provincial cult centres where the goddess was worshipped; and even there they are none too plentiful. For example, at Cusae, one of her most important sanctuaries in Upper Egypt, there is only one priestess of Hathor known for the entire Middle Kingdom;73 and with the ex- ception of Sn.t, wife of Antefoker, the vizier of Senwosret I, there are none associated with the royal court whatsoever. This coincidence sug- gests a hypothesis that the personification of the goddess Hathor and other divine figures by female members of the royal family somehow rendered the office of priestess of Hathor un- necessary. In order to test this theory, I shall now try to evaluate the role played by these priestesses under earlier regimes, no easy task, given the paucity and ambiguity of the available material. In attempting to answer our question, who was Hathor, two answers come to mind. The first is that she was a type of deity rather than a single entity that manifested itself in various forms and places. This plurality is well demonstrated in the later notion of the "seven Hathors," bovine or cow-headed creatures that assist in childbirth. Indeed most of the goddess' common forms, cows, trees, or papyrus, all suggest a nurtur- ing, life-giving goddess of the type common to all traditional societies.77 As Kurt Sethe long ago observed in Urgeschichte und dgyptische Religion der Agypter, Hathor undoubtedly concealed in herself the identity of many fertility and protec- tive goddesses of the folk or "little tradition" of the non-elite classes. On the other hand, as her name suggests, Hathor was the creation, and, initially, a rather bloodless and abstract one at that, of the specula- tion of the elite aimed at providing an ideology 65 "Snefrou et les rameuses," Revue d'Egyptologie (herein- after RdE) 21 (1969), 19-25. 66 "La dea e il gioiello: simbologia religiosa nella fa- miglia reale femminile della XII Dinastia," La Parola del Pas- sato, fasc. 224 (1985), 321-37. 67 Ibid., 333fF. 58 Ibid., 327, 329; H.

Rudolf Anthes was undoubtedly right when he suggested that the Pyramid Texts and other early texts support an interpretation of Hathor, sell "the house of Ho- rus," as the building in Heliopolis where Horus, the prototype king was acclaimed as king by his peers, the pct or "patricians." In a similar way, Isis was the throne which made a person into a king when he sat on it.80 But this model, reminis- cent in many ways to that suggested by Thorkild Jacobson in his theory of Sumerian primitive democracy, could not have held much appeal for a sentimental, family-loving people like the Egyptians. The humanizing of this scenario, which later produced the Osiris myth,82 also connected Hathor with Horus, a god of kingship with celes- tial associations. These were amplified with the union of Horus and Re as Re-Horakhty when Hathor become the mother and protector of both the creator sun and his earthly representa- tive, the king.83 At Heliopolis, Hathor must have been associated with the original Benben, as the copies in the Fifth Dynasty sun temples at Mem- phis show. She was also conflated with the local tree goddesses, Iusaas and Nebethetepet, and, perhaps, even with the mountain goddess of nearby Gerf Hussain.85 Her celestial associations no doubt encouraged her absorption of the sky cow goddess Bat. Indeed, it could be argued that wherever the ruling elite penetrated, local goddesses tended to be absorbed into Hathor's identity, specifically to support the ideology of the kingship and its perpetuation. The presence of boat-graves in tombs as early as the First Dynasty suggests that the ideology of solar kingship was already well along in the pro- cess of formation.

By the 25th Dynasty, the temple of Nebethetepet de- picted on Turin 2682 (H. Ricke, "Eine Inventartafel aus Heliopolis im Turiner Museum." ZAS 71 [1935], 111, 132) contained many objects of Hathorian significance, such as shm-sistra and whs. (The wh was an object associated with Hathor at Cusae, but also found in the mortuary and sun temples of the 5th Dynasty where it was used in the Sokar festival [see Gillam, "Studies," pp. 490-514].) Hathor was here the goddess of the red mountain, Gebel el-Ahmar, the site of a large quarry and grotto carved in her honour by Ramesses II, who also described this god- dess as nb.t dsr.t in the stela of Manshiyet es-Sadr, which dates from years 7-8 (Champollion, Notices Descriptives I [Paris, 1864], 133; Vandier, RdE, loc. cit., 97, pl. 15; ID III, pl. 178, A.

Hamada, "Stela from Manshiyet es Sadr," ASAE 38 [1938]), 217-30, pl. 30). Perhaps this particular cult of Hathor, where the goddess is identified with the mountain was anal- ogous to other cults such as Deir el-Bahari, Serabit el- Khadim or Timna (see E. Naville, The Xlth Dynasty Temple at Deir el Bahari [London, 1907-13] I, 24-31, 63-7, III, 1-8, 13-18, pls. 7-10, 14-16, 24-26; W. M. F.

Priestesses of Hathor and the Kings of the 4th Dynasty Evidence both of officers of the cult of Hathor and her actual celebration by the ruler does not seem to antedate the mid Fourth Dynasty. Al- though later sources associate Snefru with the building of a mr.t temple for Hathor and he was linked with her in later cults and legends (like P. Westcar), the locus of Hathoric activity seems to be the Giza necropolis. As Lehner has shown, this cemetery was planned and land- scaped as a unity from the beginning, in the reign of Khufu, and significant nodal points like the Great Sphinx manifested the ideology of divine kingship. Another significant religious site, which doubtless preceded Khufu's grand de- sign was a sacred sycamore tree, like many found along the desert edge. This became part of the royal mythology when its goddess was identified with Hathor, conveniently, since sycamore god- desses were also associated with the care of the dead.95 That this was an ad hoc creation is dem- onstrated by Hathor's appearance on the Men- kaure triads, her first known anthropomorphic depiction. Although she appears here with her familiar disk and horns, the iconography is still evidently experimental, as the horns are wavy and slope backwards, more like the extinct Egyptian ram than the familiar longhorn. Although there are no contemporary docu- ments to connect Khufu with Hathor, an in- scription in the temple of Dendera states that plans for the temple were found which dated from his reign.9 However, given that this is a very late source and Khufu was a famous fig- ure, this statement seems virtually worthless. Of more interest is that two women as well as two men who are hmw. ( t) ntr Hthr are also priests of Khufu during the Old Kingdom.98 Two women, Wmt.t-kj and Mr-it. f.s, were married to priests of Khufu." 6. Priestesses of Hathor at Memphis in the Old Kingdom While the reign of Redjedef gives us our first documented priestess, it was Khafre who in- scribed the name of Hathor on his own funerary temple. Perhaps it is the doorway inscribed for her that was tended by Db. t who was hm. t ntr Hthr hnt.t Hc.f-rc}^ assuming that hnt.t means here "in front of," rather than "preeminent." Db.t is also priestess of Neith who is in front of (the temple of) Khafre, Neith perhaps standing in here for Bastet as the goddess of the north, as well as priestess of Hathor of the sycamore.

However, there is concrete evidence that this second Hathor sanctuary existed in the Memphite necropolis as early as the late Old Kingdom. Nb.t, the daughter of King Teti's vi- zier Mrr-wi-kj(i) , is hm.t ntr Hthr nb.t rs.t.108 Hnm-htp, a male functionary who held office in the sun and pyramid temples of Userkaf and, perhaps, a close contemporary of this king, was imy-r [hw.t] Hthr [n] nh.t. Since he was buried in the Saqqara necropolis (Mariette D 49), it is possible that he was responsible for the south- ern sycamore temple, which would thus have existed from the beginning of the 5th Dynasty. This would make sense, since the funerary com- plexes and sun temples of these kings, which all contained cults of Hathor, were far to the south of the Giza necropolis.110 Thus, it is likely that women who hold the title priestess of Hathor at Saqqara are connected with the southern sanc- tuary. Later references to the sycamores associ- ated with the funerary complex of Snefru at Dashur suggest yet further branches of this royal mortuary cult.111 Although it is likely that a priestess would be attached to the sycamore cult nearest the pyramid and residence city of the reigning sovereign, some had a wider juris- diction, as the title, Priestess of Hathor, mistress of the Sycamore in all her places, suggests. Apart from the titles Priestess of Hathor of the Sycamore, Priestess of Hathor of the Syca- more in all her places, Priestess of Hathor in all her places, Priestess of Hathor before the temple of Khafre, and of Hathor in the mrt buildings of various kings, other cults of Hathor with female hmw.t ntr attested in the Memphite area also include Hathor mistress of Dendera (some- 1 1 Q times in all her places) , Hathor mistress of the desert {smit) , and from late in the 6th Dynasty, Hathor mistress of Heaven.115 However, apart from five priestesses of Hathor of Dendera, these variations are statistically negligible. By far the greatest number of priestesses of Hathor have no special affiliation whatsoever, they are simply hm.t. ntr Hthr At Giza fifty-one out of a total of eighty-one women hold this title, and at Saqqara fifty-three out of sixty-five.117 Taken together these women of the north and south Memphite necropolis far outnumber those from all other centres for the 4th through the 12th Dynasty. Out of all mentions of priestess of Ha- thor, the plain variant occurs 259 times in this whole period. Although these numbers include instances where the plain title is held by women who also have specific variants, they are indeed striking and raise, even more urgently, the ques- tion of what these women actually did. Marianne Galvin has asserted that even where hm.t ntr Hthr occurs in a titular string with a place- specific variant it is to be considered a separate title rather than an abbreviation.

It can be demonstrated that male title holders of the plain variant are of lower rank than those who hold the place specific versions.119 In the Old Kingdom, the congruence of title elaboration with high rank seems to be the general rule. It is likely that if the title hm.t. ntr Hthr is not an ab- breviation of a place specific variant, it represents a lower rank in the hm.t ntr hierarchy through which the holder had passed at an earlier time; it must not be forgotten that Old Kingdom title strings record all the titles ever held by an indi- vidual (but, unfortunately for us, not always in comprehensible order of time or rank). It is im- portant to establish that hm.t ntr Hthr is a lesser version of place specific title since it puts to rest the troubling vision of priestesses of Hathor at large, an idea only attractive to those who think of them as little more than itinerant musicians or wise women. These women performed the daily cult for Hathor in sanctuaries specifically con- nected with the ruling family of Old Kingdom Memphis. This may be demonstrated by closer examination of their ranking titles and family connections. In later times Hathor is closely associated with the queen ( hm. t nstv wr. t) ; and scholars like Wente and Barta have postulated some kind of sacred marriage with the king and queen as Re and Hathor.122 On the other hand, Shafik Allam has asserted in his study of priestesses of Hathor that queens have nothing to do with the cult. Nei- ther position seems adequate to characterize the actual data from Old Kingdom Memphis. Material datable to the 4th Dynasty suggests that although queens may be priestesses of Hathor (Mrs-Cnh III, hm.t ntr H, hm.t ntr H nb.t Iwn.t, G7530; Bw-nfr (h. n. H),124 it is certainly more common among sSw.t nsw n ht.f (Nfr-htp.s, daughter of Dejedefre and both the above queens), and after the mid 4th Dynasty, rh.t nsw is a common complement of our title (see Appendix I). Although Junker's suggestion that rh.t nsw means king's relative is unlikely to be true, it seems to suggest some extended family connection, as does the honourary use of the ti- tles king's son and daughter which become com- mon at this time. It seems that in the 4th Dynasty, most of the title holders are connected with the king, either as actual daughters or near relatives. Apart from the women already mentioned there is Nb-htp, wife of Nb-m-jht,127 the son of Mrs-Cnh III (h. n.

Many men who hold priesthoods of Re and Hathor in the pyramid and sun temples are mar- ried or closely related to priestesses of Hathor.138 The persistence of certain names among these women is to be noted: Hnw.t.sn, Hc-mrr-nbty, Mrs- cnh, Htp-hr.s and Hnt-kjw.s are those of the 4th Dynasty royal family. Some of these women, of the rank of princess, married viziers. Hc-mrr-nbty, for example married Pth-spss}^ Junker believed that members of the old ruling house had mar- ried commoner officials, but more likely the entire ruling elite was so small that it constituted an extended kin group. If, as the Turin Canon suggests, the rulers of the 8th Dynasty were de- scended from those of the First, a large pool of persons must have existed with royal blood in their veins that would provide outsiders with an entree into Memphite society. It also seems that females of this class helped perpetuate the royal house through a form of ancestor worship via the goddess who created the divine king. Seschemnofers, pl. 13, Beitrage III).

Other women of this name were married to mid-range officials connected with the judiciary, scribal organization and the royal cult, like those found in the sun temples, e.g., Htp-hr.s, married to Nht-kB (Hassan, Giza VII, 21ff., pls. 18- 20, figs. 18, 20-21) early 5th Dynasty; Htp-hr.s, married Spssi (Mariette, Mastabas, 207; Borchardt, Denkmdler I, 37) early 5th Dynasty; five priestesses named Hnt-kBw.s are known from the Memphite area in the 5th Dynasty. One was married to the vizier Sndm-iblMhi (LD II 73-75, Ergdnz- band, pls.

For the original queens and other higher ranking women, possibly royal descendants, who lived during the 5th Dynasty, see Barbara Mertz, "Certain Titles of the Egyptian Queens and Their Bearing on the Hereditary Right to the Throne," Un- published Diss., U. of Chicago, 1952, 71, fig. 2; Bettina Schmitz, Untersuchungen zum Titel sB njswt "Konigsohn" (Bonn, 1976), 28-34; Junker, Giza II, 39-41. 14U Borchardt, Grab des Neuserre, 126-28, fig. 107; PMIII3, 340-47.

Romer, Zum Problem von Titular und Herkunft bei den dgypti- schen "Konigsohnen" des Alien Reiches [Berlin, 1977] 108-9). Note also that King Isosi may have married a Mrs-Cnh (Kuch- man, 87fL). This pattern seems to have been established under Shep- seskaf, when he married his daughter Hc-mjj.t to Pth-spss, the high priest of Ptah (N. Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt [trans.

Although the name of Djo- ser is noted in red ink in Col. Ill, frag. 18, this is actually a patch, there seems little reason to doubt that all these kings formed one ruling house. At the end of the 8th Dynasty, after Ibw and before Nfr-kj- rcand Hty, there is given a total, of years since Mni, of 955 years and 10 days.

They did not operate in the sun temples; they did not hold any ad- ministrative office connected with the priesthood above the rank of phyle or shift coordinator; and with very few exceptions, they did not sing or play musical instruments. They had nothing to do with the queen. In fact, the only queens who hold priesthoods of Hathor can be argued to have done so, while not in the position of royal spouse. For example Mrs-Cnh III, although cer- tainly a queen, was only a titular princess, being the daughter of prince K3-wcb. She probably acquired her title as priestess of Hathor in her youth, before becoming queen. Bw-nfr, who was probably the wife of Shepseskaf, seems to have outlived him and his branch of the ruling house, being buried in a relatively humble tomb and sur- vived by a son with only the lowly titles of judge and superintendent of scribes (sjb shd ss). Thereafter there are no other queens who hold the title of priestess of Hathor until the reign of Mentuhotep Nebhepetre of the 11th Dynasty. Queen's titularies of the Old Kingdom stress their relationship to the king as a divine being and they also are often hm.t ntr of other gods. The only exception is the title s?.t ntr, the sig- nificance of which at this period is not clearly understood. Fourth Dynasty representations of queens do not portray them any differently from other women; their clothing and general appearance are quite unremarkable. They begin to be depicted in the vulture headdress in representations and texts during the 5th Dynasty151 and by the 6th Dynasty are shown holding the cnh, hitherto reserved only for the king and other gods.152 The queens of Pepy II are given lavish burial places equipped with texts in the burial chambers, a prerogative not per- mitted other commoners at this period, and Pepy's non-royal mother cnh.n.s-mry-rc's father Hwi was permitted to call himself "father of the god.' Berlev has seen this as evidence of the development of a theory of a king being con- ceived by the god through a mortal woman. Such notions illustrate not only tenuous claims to the throne through existing family ties, but the difficulty of explaining the existence of the king as the only living, breathing divine being in a world of mortals. While the theory of divine queenship was later developed to solve such problems, the evidence presented above suggests that this did not 143 Kaiser, MDAIK 14, 104ff. Interestingly enough, the only known priestesses of Hathor, who are also imy wr.t, are from Naga ed Der, not Memphis, and are to be dated to the very late Old Kingdom or afterwards (Dunham, Stelae, 65-66, pl. 16.1; H. F. Lutz, Egyptian Tomb Steles and Offering Stones of the Museum of Anthro- pology and Ethnology of the University of California [Leipzig, 1927] , pl. 19). One of the women is imy. wr.t of hnww.t or mu- sicians (see below). On the title imy. wr.t, see Roth, 11-26. The title hm.t ntr Hthr wr(t) sww.t.s nb.t, which Galvin inter- prets as "chief priestess" ("Priestesses", 80) of the king's daughter Hm.t-rc (Hassan, Hemet Rec and Others, 5 pls. 2-4; Borchardt, Denkmdlerl, 22 [CG 1524] ) does not exist. The wr sign is, in fact, an m. The only hnw(t) known from the Old Kingdom at Memphis is a man named Tnmw, buried at Giza (Fischer, "A False Door of the Old Kingdom in Bologna," Varia, 11, n. 9. The other title holder from the Old Kingdom is Phr-nfr.t, a priestess of Hathor, who was married to Ppy-Cnh Hr-ib, the overseer of priests of Hathor of Cusae in the latter part of the reign of Pepy II (Blackman, Meir IV, pl. 15; Gillam, "Studies," 135-39,230-44). 146 See Romer, 28ff. 147 Hassan, Giza III, 176, 196, figs. 147, 149, 150, 152, 156, 159, pls. 54-56, 58.

At this period, the king's divinity was the result of union with gods not mortals. Just as the Pyramid Texts show that Isis, the throne, brought about the rebirth of the king in the next world as explained in the myth of Osiris, Hathor, the en- closure or hw.t maintained the legitimacy of the King in this one. In contrast with the Coffin Texts, the Pyramid Texts contain only a few references to this goddess, suggesting that her role as a mortuary deity was not one that the house of Memphis needed to appropriate. If Hathor played a role in the king's afterlife at this period, it was as the congener of Re with whom he was closely identified as ruler of gods and mortals.159 The priestesses of Hathor were em- ployed to maintain this relationship in her own temples, in the royal funerary complexes, and in the mr.t buildings built within the precinct of the palace and often maintained for generations. Whatever went on in these temples, it was cer- tainly not the sacred marriage of king and queen suggested by Barta. Attempts to connect these structures with the mrw buildings of the Amarna period or the Mammisis found in Graeco-Roman temples cannot be proven. 8. Priestesses of Hathor outside Memphis in the Old Kingdom We have already observed that the priestesses of Hathor of Memphis far outnumber others at- tested at any other site for the whole of the Old and Middle Kingdoms. They also predate office holders at the other sites. Indeed, it seems obvious that the cult of the royal goddess fol- lowed the ruling elite as it organized the towns of Upper Egypt (evidence for the Delta is not so clear) as centres for the redistribution of goods and services for its benefit. Whereas the officials who administered the hinterland during the 4th Dynasty, officials like Mtn or Ntr-Cpr.f, governed largely out of the cap- ital or, at least, were buried there, the 5th Dynasty regime settled its officers in the actual centres.165 As we have already noted in the case of Nkj-Cnh of Tehneh, such officials often held the office of Overseer of the New Towns (imy-r niww.t niDDW.t)}^ suggesting a policy of internal coloni- zation and a need to administer the ever growing number of royal and elite estates whose existence is attested in Memphite tomb chapels and royal mortuary complexes of this period. Officials holding this and similar titles are found at Hagarsa, Hemamiya Sheikh Said, Zawyet el- Amwat, and Deshasheh, suggesting a policy to settle and control the underdeveloped middle Egyptian area, valuable for its large tracts of arable land. Both men and women holding priesthoods of Hathor are found among this new class of administrators, representing as they do 156 J. G.

That priestesses of Hathor are to be found among these provincial admin- istrators is no surprise, since as high ranking members of the elite descended from the Fourth Dynasty royal family, they made a desirable match for any ambitious bureaucrat. A special case seems to be that of Dendera, whose cult of Hathor is the only non-Memphite form of this goddess attested at the capital in the 4th Dynasty. Although there has been some speculation that Dendera (Iwn.t) was equated with Heliopolis as its feminine counterpart, as Hathor was Re's feminine counterpart, it may also be possible that the goddess of Iwn.t, which had been settled before the Archaic period, had a popularity that allowed her to be iden- tified with her royal equivalent. 9. The Cult and Personnel of Hathor in the 6th Dynasty and Later At the beginning of the 6th Dynasty, when the central government was reorganized, attempts to order and exploit the resources of the countryside were redoubled. If the Mem- phite necropolis is any guide, the population, especially of the official class, burgeoned; and power came to reside in the hands of powerful viziers like Kj-gm.n.(i) cnh-mc-hr and Mrr-wi- kS(i), who also controlled the pyramid city of the current ruler. All the cultic installations of Hathor continue to flourish and there are more hmw.t ntr Hthr than even before. Al- though some, like Mrr-wi-kj. (z)'s wife Wr-th-hthr, preserve the old titular and ranking pattern of princess and priestess of Neith, most are of the mid-range rank, the main difference being that the ranking title rh.t nsw has been replaced with hkr.t nsw/wct.t and for a brief period in Deshahsheh, Sheikh Said, Dara, Tehna, Cusae, Deir el- Gebrawi, Abydos, and Athribis; and men connected with the cult of Hathor are found at Dendera, Cusae, Tehneh, and Sheikh Said.

Although the hkr.t nsw titles probably represent a hierarchy of elaboration, it is also possible that in some cases the short form is just an abbreviation of the other.180 Indeed the cult was encouraged by a particular interest that the kings of the Sixth Dynasty felt for Hathor of Dendera. Teti dedicated an alabas- ter sistrum to the goddess and his son Pepy I made a point of styling himself son of Hathor of Dendera. He lavished his patronage on the temple of this town and installed a new line of provincial administrators who were also over- 1 8^ seers of the cult. Pepy's architect and overseer of works, Nhbw, tells us that he embarked on a programme of irrigation improvement all over the country. The remains of one of the kS houses Pepy built for himself throughout Egypt, which has been found at Bubastis, prominently displays Pepy's connection with Hathor. The link between the religious ideology of this exer- cise and its economic benefits hinge on the fact that royal mortuary foundations were one of the main methods of economic redistribution and sources of employment for the expanding elite class.186 A plethora of decrees dating from the 6th Dynasty shows that the employees of these establishments benefitted from all manner of ex- 1 8^7 emptions from taxation and forced labour. Given Pepy's interest in Hathor, this pro- gramme of cultic colonization is probably re- sponsible for the origin of most of the centres of Hathor's worship in Upper Egypt. In a cen- tres, like Thebes, his favourite goddess, Hathor of Dendera, was later equated with a local deity like the goddess of the western mountain.188 But at Cusae, the centre of a particularly fertile 1 SQ area in middle Egypt, her cult, which arrived with the canal digging programme of Pepy I Sm,DC.t (Jequier, Tombeaux des Particuliers, 76, pl. 11); Ksw.Lt/ Nw.t-wdnw (Firth and Gunn, Teti Pyramid Cemeteries, 196- 97); Gm.n.i-s.tlDwDW.htp (Firth and Gunn, Teti Pyramid Ceme- teries, 188, 54, 258-59, pl. 75); Dft.s (Jequier, Tombeaux des Particuliers, 86, fig. 97).

Senwosret III erected many statues of himself in Mentuhotep's temple at Deir el-Bahari, where he also had himself depicted before this king, together with Hathor (Naville, The Xlth Dynasty Temple at Deir el Bahari [3 Volumes, London, 1894-1908] III, 10-11). The other evi- dence for the early existence of Hathor's cult and what later became The Feast of the Valley is largely based on (1) the existence of Thutmose Ill's Hathor shrine next to Mentu- hotep's temple and (2) New Kingdom votive objects that show Hathor and Mentuhotep (Naville, Xlth Dynasty Temple I, 61; Allam, Hathorkult, 61ff., G. Pinch, Votive Offerings to Hathor [Oxford, 1993]). 189 See Gillam, "Studies," 23-67. 190 An earlier mention of Hathor in connection with the Cusite nome is found in a list of funerary estates in the fragmentary name of the establishment Mr[hthr-Cnh] Ni-wsr-rc</page><page sequence="19">PRIESTESSES OF HATHOR: THEIR FUNCTION, DECLINE AND DISAPPEARANCE 229 and later hw.t k? of his son, seems to have been created ex nihilo. Every significant aspect of the cult, from the sacred tnt.t cows, the wh fetish, to the office of hnw.t or female musician priest, which was just beginning to be adopted in the capital, can be seen to originate in the Memphite area. The ideological and eco- nomic importance of the cult of Hathor of Cu- sae is demonstrated by the fact that the main players in this nome are the overseers of priests and not the administrators (hryw tp-cj). Hw- n-wh, one of the earlier functionaries, who was originally a shd hmw ntr and later elevated to overseer of priests,19 had a peculiar titulary which connected him with the celebration of the sed festival,195 an event, which, one imag- ines, could only take place in the capital. Both his wives and all his daughters were priestesses of Hathor. Perhaps he was imported as a rit- ual expert to found the cult, while others took care of the economic infrastructure of the area. It may have been for this reason that he was buried at Quseir el-Amarna, right across the river from Cusae, rather than the necropolis of Meir, the remote western cemetery where his successors were buried. Cusae's close con- nection with the metropolis is also seen in the titulary of a later overseer of priests, Ppy-Cnh Hr-ib, whose autobiography we have already quoted. Apart from holding a number of sacer- dotal titles, which also seem to connect him with the royal cult and sed festival, Ppy-Cnh was also a vizier, although perhaps only respon- sible for the middle Egyptian area. Needless to say, there are priestesses of Hathor at Cusae in the Old Kingdom, although their relative numbers are few in relation to Memphis. Perhaps this is because there was only one cult centre of Hathor and the overseer of priests played a major cultic role in it. Two other important centres for priestesses of Hathor in Upper Egypt are Akhmim and Naga ed-Der. We have already noted four priestesses of Hathor of the Sycamore at Akhmim, which ("Hathor desires that Neuserre might live") (Jacquet- Gordon, op. cit., 71). However, there is no proof of an ac- tual cult or personnel of the cult of Hathor in the Cusite nome at this early date. Pepy I's architect and overseer of works, Nhbw, states that "his majesty sent me ... to dig [a canal?] for his . . . [of Hathor] of Cusae" (Urk. I 221.6-7; Dunham, JEA 24, loc. cit., pl. 2). See also Gillam, "Studies," 90-91. For the kS house of Pepy II, see G. Jequier, Le Monu- ment funeraire de Pepi II (t. Ill, Cairo, 1940), pl. 27 and Gillam, "Studies," 73-74. The first known functionary of the tnt.t ("outstand- ing?") cows is mniw (herdsman) , Rc-mnw-kj, who was buried at Giza in the late 6th or early 6th Dynasty (Hassan, Giza II, 169ff., figs. 204, 208, 210, pls. 61-62). The ht-wr tnt.t, cnh-ir.s, also from Giza (Curto, Gli Scavi I, 78-83, pls. 23-25, figs. 32- 33; Reisner, Giza Necropolis, 492) may be somewhat later. As Fischer (Dendera, 25-26) has pointed out, since Rc-mnw-kj is also a priest of Harsomtus, and his tomb preserves a fragmen- tary mention of Hathor of Dendera, the tnt.t cows are to be as- sociated with this town. However, it should be noted that the first mention of the tnt.t cows at Dendera itself is no earlier than the end of the 6th Dynasty (Fischer, Dendera, 120). On the hnw.t priestess, see above n. 32. The wh is a cultic object, first found in the sun and funerary temples of the 5th Dynasty (F.

The latter title (imy-r hmw ntr) only appears on the outside of the tomb. Although I placed Hw-n-wh later, in the middle of the reign of Pepy II (Gillam, "Studies," 486-89; review of Quseir el-Amarna, Discussions in Egyptology 20 [1991], 75-87), it now seems clear that Kanawati 's dating of Hw-n-wh, in the reign of Pepy I or Merenre, is correct. Hw-n-wh has similar titles to a Memphite official, Wr- nww, who probably dates from some time later in the 6th Dynasty. See W. V. Davies, A. el-Khouli, A. B. Lloyd and A. J.

However, if we accept Naguib Kanawati 's sugges- tion that many of the monuments thought of as characteristic of the First Intermediate Period are to be dated to the earlier 6th Dynasty, it is probable that some of these women followed their husbands straight from the Memphite court when they took up their new administra- tive posts. However, since Akhmim was already the centre of an ancient and important cult of the god Min, these priestesses augmented their duties to their official deity with positions 90^ in the local cult as keepers of the sacred vigil. The possibility raised by Kanawati that much inscribed material formerly dated to the First Intermediate Period may be as early as the late 5th or early 6th Dynasty helps explain the pres- ence of more priestesses of Hathor and Naga ed-Der and its environs than anywhere else other than Memphis itself, a total of thirty-four in number. These cemeteries served Abydos/ This, which as the burial place of the rulers of the Archaic Period and probably their ancestral home.205 In the first half of the Sixth Dynasty, when upper Egypt was apparently divided into two separate administrative areas, This be- came its administrative centre. As late as the 8th or 9th Dynasty, an administrative council known as the Council of the Overseer of Upper Egypt existed here, although if we are to be- lieve cnh.ty.fy, it has lost any real power it might ever have had.208 It is, therefore, not remarkable that there are so many priestess of Hathor in the Thinite nome.

Although Fischer (JAOS 74, 32) sug- gests religious and historical reasons for the prominence of Abydos, Kanawati (Governmental Reforms, 31ff., 48, 62-64) thinks this may have more to do with the marriage of Pepy I to the two like-named daughters of Hwy, the first of a line of nomarchs of Abydos, who held many other important posi- tions, including the Vezirate. By the latter part of the reign of Pepy II, this family had disappeared and the rulership of the Thinite nome seems to diminish in importance (ibid., 92-94). 208 J.

Such persons simply repre- sented a branch-plant operation of the central government complete with its official cult of royal self perpetuation. As at Akhmim, there was no attempt to start a new local cult or inter- fere with the venerable, existing local cults. 10. Mentuhotep Nebhepetre and the Cult of Hathor When the Memphite system of government and ruling house finally collapsed at the end of the 8th Dynasty, a period of internal struggle and economic decline ensued. This seems to have been exacerbated by famine and plague; and it could have been well over a century before a ruler strong enough to unite the whole country emerged. That person was Mentuhotep, the sec- ond of that name, of the house of Inyotef, a fam- ily originating in the general area of Thebes. Although his name linked him with the local warrior god, Mentuhotep realized that Egypt had to be united by propaganda as much as military might. Early in his long reign he began describ- ing himself as the son of Hathor of Dendera,212 who as well as being worshipped at Thebes, had the cachet of the great rulers of old like Teti and Pepy I. He was, no doubt, also aware of the an- cient cult of Hathor that had perpetuated the Memphite succession. However, unable to trace his descent from the 900 year old house of Memphis, Mentuhotep had to become creative in his use of the royal goddess. In the earlier part of his reign he celebrated his connection with the goddess in a hw.t k? he had constructed at Dendera, optimistically showing himself bringing the entire country under con- trol for her. The reliefs also show the first depictions of Hathor offering her sistrum and menat to the kings, suckling him both in human and cow form.2 These representations suggest not only the contamination of the original Mem- phite royal theogony from other sources, but show Mentuhotep meant that his position as Hathor's son was to be taken extremely liter- ally. As Labib Habachi has shown, Mentuhotep used his monuments to identify himself as closely as possible with a number of gods, apart from the traditional Re-Horus association. The king's theological legitimacy was to be expressed in his funerary complex at Deir el- Bahari, just as his Old Kingdom predecessors' was in their pyramid ensembles. Sometime in the period prior to his final conquest of the north, Mentuhotep decided to strengthen his legitimacy and that of his successors by actually marrying a number of priestesses of Hathor. In the plan of the temple at this time, their chapels with their tombs underneath them, formed part of a unified complex like the sub- sidiary pyramids of the queens of the Old King- dom.

Of particular note is the milking scene in the burial chamber of Kmsit (Naville, op. cit., Ill, pl. 2) which takes place in a papyrus thicket. Does it represent the cow in her natural environment, the marshes, or is it an early depiction of Hathor in the papyrus?

That he did so in a hurry could be for a number of rea- sons - a high mortality rate due to disease or childbirth (one of the burials is that of a child), a need to legitimize his position by crea- ting heirs - all are more acceptable than Ward's suggestion that they died before they actually became queens. No one would be given such an exalted title, so publicly displayed unless they were entitled to use it. Of the women buried in this complex, cSsy.t, K3wi t, Kmsi. t and Sjdh are designated as hm. t nsw, either in their funerary chapels or in the temple reliefs proper. While Hnhn.t is not attested as hm.t nsw in any surviving inscription, she shares the other designations of these women, hkr.t nsw wct.t and hm.t ntr Hthr, it seems likely, given the position of her chapel in line with the others, that she was also a queen. Other priestesses of Hathor, obviously not queens, such as Imn.t were buried elsewhere in the complex, but since they were not placed near the chapels, should be consid- ered as regular courtiers. That these women functioned as actual consorts of the king is shown unambiguously by reliefs from the chapels which depict the woman in question seated on a wide seat or bed, embraced by her husband.223 Such depictions of marital relations are unknown in the royal art of the Old Kingdom, and like much else in Mentuhotep's temple were borrowed from private iconography224 indicating that he was not yet confident of his royal status, much as he wished to make innovations in the depiction of the myth of divine royal theocracy. The burial of MSy.t, a five year old child, does not record any titles. A possible reason for this may be that she was the child of one of the other women by a previous marriage, or that she died too suddenly for her burial equipment to be inscribed. Still, it is strange that if she is the offspring of one of these women and Mentuhotep, that she does not bear the title of king's daughter. The king also had two other wives, presum- ably his principal consorts, who both bore the title hm.t nsw wr.t. The earlier one, queen Nfrw, who was also s?.t nsw wct.t^^ is thought to be Mentuhotep's full sister since both their moth- ers are called Ich, although Ward has ques- tioned this on the basis of differences of spelling. She was buried in a lavish rock-cut tomb in the face of the cliffs bordering the temple precinct, at some period before the final phase of the construction of the temple follow- ing the reunification of Egypt. Winlock has identified the donor of a piece of linen in a communal burial of this period, hkr.t nsw wct.t, hm.t ntr Hthr, Nfrw as this queen, and Ward suggests that the wives of Mentuhotep were drawn from a common pool of such court women. However, tempting as it is to see this king married to another priestess of Hathor, this is tenuous evidence indeed, considering that Nfrw is an extremely common name, as is W.

Another queen, Tm, whose importance was signalled by the fact that she was mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, was buried within the precincts of the temple proper at some time after the construction of the earlier royal tomb ("Bab el- Hosan") and the lesser queen's chapels, possible as late as the final years of Mentuhotep's reign. That Tm postdates Nfrw is suggested by her being credited with the heir to the throne. It is also noteworthy that she is nowhere mentioned as being a priestess of Hathor. It seems that after the reunification of the country Mentuhotep sought other ways to demonstrate his legitimacy, as when he depicted his actual parents in a commemorative graffito in the Shatt er-Rigal. Oleg Berlev has suggested that this depiction represents a development of the "divine birth" theory of kingship were a mortal woman is di- rectly inseminated by the god.235 Mentuhotep's determination to secure his line of succession is also seen in his designation of Tm as king's mother. Apparently union with priestesses of Hathor as a way of legitimizing his rulership was abandoned when his unification of Egypt was complete, although his burial complex is posi- tioned in front of the local cult of the goddess of the west, long identified with Hathor; and she seemed to play an important role in the cult and depictions of his temple proper. 11. Priestesses of Hathor and the Royal Cult of the Goddess in the Middle Kingdom Priestesses of Hathor can be attested for the remainder of the 11th Dynasty throughout the country, but they almost entirely disappear from the royal court after the beginning of the 12th. The last important one is Sn.t wife of Ini-it.f-ikr, vizier of Senwosret I. In her tomb at Thebes, she is hm. t ntr Hthr and imBy. t hr Hthr hry[t] tp st, and revered before Hathor, mistress of the desert. This likely refers to Deir el-Bahari and the cult of Hathor, already commemorated by Mentuhotep and the later Feast of the Valley. This suggests that Sn. t both originated from this area and rep- resented a member of the old elite of the 11th Dynasty, a possibility also in the case of her hus- band, whose name associates him also with the earlier house of Inyotef. Perhaps Senwosret ap- pointed this representative of the old ruling house as vizier to guard against a possible counter coup, like the plot that killed his father.238 With the exception of Sn.t, almost all 12th Dynasty priestesses of Hathor are found in the households of provincial governors, and, even here, their numbers are greatly diminished. For example there is only one at Cusae, a major center of the cult of Hathor, for the whole Middle Kingdom.240 What we do notice is the depiction of women offering the menat and sistra to revivify the deceased (a ceremony first attested in the late Old Kingdom) and the re- placement of women by men as functionaries of this cult (not just as hm ntr, but wcb, or temple i- \ 241 custodian). i- \ 232 See above, n. 178. 233 Winlock, Rise and Fall, 43, n. 60, cf.

By the reign of Amenem- het II, specifically Hathoric jewellery began to be made for queens and princesses. It is also significant that the name of the Nekhbet-iden- tified princess Hnm.t-nfr.hd.t also was used as a queen's title at this period. In the later 12th Dynasty Amenemhet III depicted Hathor offer- ing the menat in the temple of his ancestor Amenemhet I and at Medinet Maadi, his daughter Nfrw-pth is shown playing a sistrum for the goddess Renenutet and wearing a diadem with plumes at the back, similar to that belong- ing to princess Sj.t-hthr-iwn.tr It is also from the late 12th Dynasty that fragmentary depic- tions of queens in sphinx form are known; and it is Nfr.t, queen of Senwosret II, who is shown wearing the distinctive coiffure with curl- ing plaits which later became so closely iden- tified with Hathor, a goddess known as "she of the plait."249 12. Conclusion To conclude, I would like to offer this evi- dence for a hypothesis that the cultic activity of Old Kingdom priestesses of Hathor was origi- nally devised by the rulers of the 4th Dynasty to ensure the religious legitimacy and perpetua- tion of their hegemony. Since all the rulers of the Old Kingdom were part of a single extended kin-group, the ideology of the king-making god- dess and her cult remained unchanged while they held sway. However, with the disappear- ance of this line and the anarchy of the First In- termediate Period, when royal legitimacy had to be created ex nihilo, more dramatic and tangible proofs of the right to rule had to be produced. Mentuhotep tried to create a new myth of the royal succession, first by calling himself son of Hathor, like Old Kingdom rulers, and then ac- tually marrying her priestesses. Given the insta- bility of dynastic rule as demonstrated by the fall of his house, that of Inyotef, it seemed logical that the divinity of the ruler and his right to rule be directly embodied in his own person and those of his wife and children, who played the role of Hathor/Buto and Nekhbet opposite his Re/Horus. That this development also coin- cided with the gradual exclusion of women from the daily cult of the gods explains the disappear- ance of the office of functioning priestess of Hathor that had been such an important part of the life of the elite women of ancient Egypt for the best part of a millennium.
