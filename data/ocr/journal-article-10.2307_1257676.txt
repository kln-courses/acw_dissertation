<plain_text><page sequence="1">In his article on " Bhagwan, the supreme deity of the Bhils " in Anthropos (xxxv/xxxvi, 1940-41), Father Koppers seeks to analyse Bhil legends of the Creation and the Deluge, and the general Bhil attitude to their High God to throw light on the history of religions in India. He suggests incidentally that the Bhils represent a population element which is fundamentally distinct from what he calls Aryan, Dravidian, and Munda elements. His use of these linguistic terms in what is apparently a racial sense is unfortunate and confusing, as the languages spoken are often a most unreliable guide to the physical and cultural affinities of the various peoples of India, and particularly of central India. The Nahal tribe now uses a language predominantly Indo-Aryan, but which apparently had a Dravidian complexion before that, and was probably Kolarian at a still earlier date. The Oraons have a definitely Dravidian speech, but are physically and culturally very close indeed to their Munda neighbours. Legends, myths, and religious ideas are probably as easily shed and acquired as languages are, where there is no written word, and in spite of Father Koppers' opinion one must feel very doubtful how far the present beliefs of the Bhil people represent anything more than the results of external contacts. The insistence of the Bhils on the importance of charity very strongly suggests the influence of Islam, which we know to have been considerable in some portions of the tribe. Nevertheless it is of undoubted interest to note the suggestion that the Bhils represent a distinct element in the population of India. Guha's work on them from the purely physical standpoint gave a similar indication in 1933 in terms of his coefficients of racial likeness.</page><page sequence="2">268 There seems, however, to be little justification for Father Koppers' postulate that Hindu evolutionary pantheism developed as a result of the loss of belief in a personal god and in his act of creation. The Hindu philosophy has its roots in a materialistic conception of life-matter which is much more primitive in nature than any story of the creation of man by an anthropomorphic god. Bhagwan among the Baiga has many of the attributes of a culture hero, and even among the Bhils he is associated with the giving of corn to man in a way that may be significant of an origin of this kind. The name Dharmes for the supreme deity is surely no more " native" to the Oraon tribe than Bhagwan is to the Bhil, and Dharmeswar as a name for him is common among Hindus. The use of a foreign name rather suggests the borrowing of the basic conception, and though it seems likely enough that Fr. Koppers is right in his conclusion that the idea of a single supreme deity, in so far as it is found in Hinduism to-day, is a survival of some very ancient form of belief, it seems to us to be stretching hypothesis unduly and unnecessarily far to suppose that the title Bhagwin was borrowed by the Bhils from the Rigvedic Bhaga because they " recognized that ... Bhagwdn corresponded most closely to that Supreme Deity which ... they already worshipped." J. H. H.</page></plain_text>
