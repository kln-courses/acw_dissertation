<plain_text><page sequence="1">CARLYLE'S CONCEPTION OF RELIGION HERBERT L. STEWART Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia Froude has told us that despite all the doubts which Carlyle entertained about historical Christianity he remained throughout life an uncompromising theist.' Numerous passages, especially from Sartor, from Cromwell, and from Past and Present, seem to confirm this judgment of the biographer. Yet it is worth our notice that so intimate a friend as John Sterling was by no means sure of the old prophet's belief in divine personality. Sterling was even distressed about it. So much that Carlyle said seemed to point in the orthodox direction, so large a part of his teaching lost sig- nificance if such belief were repudiated, so many of his onslaughts upon other thinkers involved the cruciality of this difference, that the churchman was impatient until his friend should have explicitly ranged himself "on the side of the angels." Yet, when pressed on the matter, Carlyle was wont to take refuge in ambiguities. He would speak with fervor of what this faith had historically effected; he would declare that without it no nation and no man had ever come to much;2 he would even fiercely insist that it must be no mere theoretical assent to the theistic principle, no mere acquies- cence in the idea of a Divine Mechanician who had made the uni- verse and. watched it go, but a constant trust in a particular Providence shaping human affairs and holding men responsible for their acts.3 In his interpretation of history the heroisms of the past had been shown by men who believed, not in the Etre Supreme of Robespierre,4 but in the God of John Knox, not in the deity whom if He had not existed it would have been necessary for Voltaire to invent, but in the All-Seeing Judge of the English Revolutionists.

If Oliver's body had been hanged in chains on Tyburn, this was simply because he "had found the Christian religion inexecutable in this country";2 if amid many similarities of personal endow- ment he was so much more to be admired than Frederick the Great, it was enough to point out that the one had grown up among the Puritans and the other among poor French philosophes, that the one had his gospel of life in the Bible, while the other had to rely upon "the withered Pontiff of Encyclopaedism."3 At the same time, for a writer who had so conspicuously both the courage and the candor of his convictions, Carlyle was strangely indefinite about his own faith. He says of Sterling, "I remember him insisting often, and with emphasis, on what he called a 'per- sonal God,"' and excuses his own reticence on that point by plead- ing that "of such high topics it was not always pleasant to give account in the argumentative form, in a loud, hurried voice, walk- ing and arguing through the fields or streets!"4 Sterling, he con- fesses, "did look hurt" at the "flippant heterodoxy" of the famous retort about Pantheism, "Suppose it were Pot-theism, if the thing is true."5 And in one of his many citations from the young curate's letters he breaks off just where the embarrassing theme is resumed: "There follow now several pages on 'Personal God,' and other abstruse or indeed properly unspeakable matters; these, and a general Postcript of qualifying purport I will suppress."' Sterling indeed could have produced some colorable reason for uncertainty as to the sense which Carlyle attached to the religious language so constantly upon his lips. Why, for example, did he so cherish that enigmatic phrase of Faust about the world as the living visible garment of God ? Why should he have compared the secret of man's being to the secret of the Sphinx, "a riddle that he cannot rede, and for ignorance of which he suffers death" ?7 What did he I Past and Present, Book III, chap. xiv. 2 Loc. cit. 3 Frederick, Book III. 4 John Sterling, Book II, chap. iii. 5 Ibid. 6Ibid., Book II, chap. ii. 7 Past and Present, Book II; cf.

It was against this incoherence that Sterling protested. Wholly apart from religious motives or interests, he was surely right in urging Carlyle to put two and two together. It was a matter of intellectual consistency, of seeing the upshot of one's own opinions, of drawing the inference to which a scheme of thought is by implication committed. To the present writer it appears that the ambiguity in question was not due to any indecisiveness in the philosopher's own mind, still less to any wish for concealment or disguise of his spiritual attitude. It was due rather to two very different causes. In the first place, Carlyle was obsessed by the idea that the language of English theologians was permeated by "cant," and it was emi- nently distasteful to him to adopt as his own any traditional formula which they employed. This was one of his real foibles. Just as he loved to speak of hell in gross material terms, apparently because the word was out of fashion with the polite Broad Church, so I suspect he was shy of such phrases as "the personality of God," because it was used with so little reflection in ecclesiastical circles. Yet we should stultify the purport of half his writings if we sup- posed him to disbelieve in that for which this phrase stands. In the second place, his immense intellectual acquirements, did not include any severe training in metaphysic; but he had an irresistible 'Sartor, Book I, chap. viii. 2 Death of Goethe. 3 Sartor, Book III, chap. viii. 4 Ibid., Book III, chap. iii; Book I, chap. viii; cf. Characteristics.</page><page sequence="4">46 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY impulse, especially when talking theology, to play with meta- physical language. He was somewhat like a layman who ventures on the terminology of lawyers and finds that he has implied far more than was in his mind. We shall thus do him an injustice if we attribute to him all those opinions in this abstract sphere which might reasonably be inferred from his formulae if such had been used by a technical metaphysician. I shall try to make this clear by collecting and examining some of the more important passages from which a general view of his cosmic outlook may be obtained. I On the subject of religious origins Carlyle's doctrine, though in many respects it is now a commonplace, was very notably ahead of his time. He has no patience with fraud theories--"a most mournful hypothesis, that of quackery giving birth to any faith, even in savage men."' The greater faiths, at all events, had lived far too long for an explanation like that. A Cagliostro might prosper for a day, but his run would be short, like that of a forged banknote." Ere long "Nature will proclaim with terrible veracity that forged notes are forged." Conscious imposture was the key to a religion, not in its period of strength, but in its period of decay; the unfailing test was that of time. Grand Lamaism itself must have had a kind of truth in it. Mohammedanism had been the life-guidance of one hundred and eighty millions of men for twelve hundred years; who could believe that it was grounded on nothing but so much spiritual legerdemain ?3 "There is no edifice that stands long but has got itself planted here and there upon the basis of fact; and being built in many respects according to the laws of Statics.'"4 The conception of early cults as the outcome of "allegorizing" appeared to Carlyle much better, although-when taken as the whole account of the subject-quite insufficient. It was better, in that it recognized the religious impulse as a genuine experiential ' Heroes, Books I and II. 2 Cf. French Revolution, Book II, chap. iii: "The first of all Gospels is this, that a lie cannot endure forever." 3 Hero as Prophet. 4 Latter Day Pamphlets, No. III.</page><page sequence="5">CARLYLE'S CONCEPTION OF RELIGION 47 fact, and it contained the eternal principle that all expression in such a field must be symbolic. The personifications of primitive fable shadowed forth under picturesque image what men once sincerely felt about the universe in which they found themselves. But what is to us a figure must have been to them a literal truth. It was absurd to suppose, for example, that one generation deliber- ately personified the bright sky, and that a later generation mis- taking this metaphor for fact, came to conceive Zeus, the actual father of gods and men. To argue thus involved anachronism; it was not merely to pervert, it was to invert the real movement of thought.' Allegory does not precede, it follows the belief that is allegorized. One might as well assume that Christianity did not give birth to The Pilgrim's Progress, but that The Pilgrim's Progress gave birth to Christianity. Conscious symbolizing was relatively late; "the Faith had to be already there, standing believed by everybody, of which the Allegory could then become a shadow." Carlyle finds the original datum in the mingled feelings of wonder and awe. The religious mind was the mind of a little child, and it was eternally true that only they who become as little children can enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Like Plato's Cavemen when they looked out upon the sun, our ancestors were dazzled and over- whelmed by the mystery of things. More fortunate than we, they saw Nature face to face, with no disguise of learned concepts to veil from them their own ignorance. Science had not yet deluded them into thinking that they knew all about it, and if we have ceased to share their amazement, we owe this far less to our superior insight than to our superior levity. Did not the higher type of scientific man even yet recognize that the poet, the painter, the intuitive genius, have a vision into the heart of reality which is denied to him ? In rare moments of inspiration a few of us could still, thank God, recover the simplicity of the past. The universe becomes again godlike to us. We realize "the great, deep, sacred infinitude of Nescience, on which all science swims as a mere superficial film." This point is further developed in that section of Sartor which expounds "Natural Supernaturalism." To what profit had we a Heroes, Book I. 2 TIid.</page><page sequence="6">48 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY elaborated our knowledge of mechanical causation, if it has deceived us as to the ultimate Inscrutabilities ? We had become like the minnow which is familiar with the crannies and pebbles of his native creek, but understands nothing of ocean tides and trade winds and monsoons by which, in the end, the creek itself is regu- lated. Why plume ourselves on having found out that Nature is an inflexible system, while we have still so faint an inkling of the principles upon which the system rests ? Since Kant's day our very fundamental notions of space and time had become exposed as mere accidents of the human point of view. In vain do we contrast the natural with the miraculous; the distinction is only relative; to the king of Siam anyone who knows how to use an air-pump can work miracles at will. Our utmost success lies in the mere rearrangement and manipulation of forces whose essence is unknown to us; our true wisdom is but a docta ignorantia, and our fitting attitude a renewal of the early worship.' There is much in this way of thinking which recalls the spiritual position of Wordsworth. Carlyle, like the poet, would rather have been a pagan suckled in a creed outworn than have been brought up in a scientific school which dissolved the divine in mechanical explanations. He too envied the insight of the little child on whom those truths do rest Which we are toiling all our lives to find. In an age of Benthamite illumination no one valued less than he that material progress which had involved a darkening of the soul. Indeed, passage after passage of our philosopher's eloquence might be taken as epitomized in that memorable stanza: There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream The earth and every common sight To me did seem Apparelled in celestial light, The glory and the freshness of a dream. It is not now as it has been of yore;-- Turn wheresoe'er I may, By night or day, The things which I have seen I now can see no more. z Sartor, Book III, chap. viii.</page><page sequence="7">CARLYLE'S CONCEPTION OF RELIGION 49 But his conviction of the limits of science did not lead Carlyle, as it led Spencer, into a cult of the Unknowable. Sartor is not open to Mr. Bradley's reproach against First Principles, that of having asked mankind to worship the Absolute, without having first shown that the Absolute has any worshipful quality. Unreasoning awe is only the first stage; the features of mature religion could not appear until man's wonder at external phenomena had passed into the deeper wonder at the workings of his own mind and espe- cially at the tumults of his own conscience. Carlyle quotes with admiration the saying of S. Chrysostom that the true Shekinah is man himself.' Herein lay the distinguishing feature of all the higher religions. The mainspring was no longer in the conscious- ness of natural but in the consciousness of moral processes. For the earliest folk, viewing the universe as itself godlike, all the parts were equally divine; thus in the Scandinavian sagas homage alter- nates between protecting gods and destroying jdtuns. These poor Norsemen had not yet appreciated the awful distinction of Thou shalt and Thou shalt not. Once that turning-point of thought had been passed, it was not the mere magnitude of the forces surrounding him, it was rather the conflict of right and wrong raging ceaselessly within him which became for man a token of the super- natural order. To the Jew the imperative of duty was such as he could explain only through the formula "Thus saith the Lord." To the Arab-whose Mohammedanism is but a confused Chris- tianity-it was Islam, "We must submit to God." "Mark the difference between Paganism and Christianism; one great differ- ence. Paganism emblemed chiefly the operations of Nature; the destinies, efforts, combinations, vicissitudes of things and men in this world; Christianism emblemed the law of human duty, the moral law of man. One was for the sensuous nature . ... the other was not for the sensuous nature but for the moral. What a progress is here, if in that one respect only. "2 At a superficial glance Carlyle may seem to be constructing what is called in theological textbooks "the ethical argument for theism." But nothing was farther from his mind than to con- tribute to the literature of apologetics. Natural theology was his I Heroes; cf. Sartor, Book I, chap. x. * Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">50 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY bite noire. Not even Albrecht Ritschl had a more profound scorn for theoretical deductions of deity. Thus in Characteristics he tells us that vital religion has been replaced by "Discourses on Evidences, endeavouring, with smallest result, to make it probable that such a thing as religion exists." A probable God! A God whom tiny human creatures might prove to their own moderate satisfaction- such a result would be worthless, even if it could be reached. In a letter to Emerson he exclaims against" faint, possible theism, which I like considerably worse than atheism." This "which now forms our common English creed cannot be too soon swept out of the world." Diderot and Voltaire were like one who with painfully constructed sulphur match and farthing rushlight is seeking for the sun. Marks of design and the like, while suited to the devout meditation of him who already believes, were powerless to convince him who does not. Knowledge in this sphere must come, if it comes at all, "not by glimmering flint-sparks of Logic, but by an infinitely higher light of intuition, never long by Heaven's mercy wholly eclipsed in the human soul."' Thus, not through reasoning, but intuitively, does the con- viction of right and wrong within the breast lead to faith in a Divine Ruler of the world. We are all of necessity animistic; Nature is for every man the phantasy of himself.2 Belief in the paramount authority of conscience, belief that the distinction of good and evil is something which we did not make and cannot alter but to which we must reverently bow-this inevitably expresses itself as belief in God. Worship is, etymologically, just the recognition of worth; it is a value-judgment. When the Norsemen deified Odin, no doubt they selected that hero from among themselves whom they "ad- mired without limit "-thenceforth he stood for them in the place of God. Let us not smile at such fancies; there is a deep truth in them. Let us rather ask whether we ourselves cannot do the same thing "a little more wisely."' Is not such hero-worship still man's noblest attitude ? Do we not see it in Christianity itself ? ' Diderot; cf. Frederick, Book I: "Sublime Theodicde (Leibnizian justification of the ways of God) was not an article this individual had the least need of, nor at any time the least value for. 'Justify'? What doomed dog questions it then?" 2 Heroes, Book I. 3 French Revolution, Book I, chap. ii.</page><page sequence="9">CARLYLE'S CONCEPTION OF RELIGION 51 And what is the Christian affirmation of a Divine Being but the faith that all power is moral, and that the laws of the universe express a moral purpose ? Carlyle never wearies of illustrating by historical examples this intimate connection between sensitiveness to duty and a theistic creed. Especially he loves to point such contrasts as that of Mohammed, to whom right and wrong were wholly incommensur- able-the one high as heaven, the other low as hell-and Jeremy Bentham with his calculations of profit and loss, discovering after much addition and subtraction that the right "preponderates considerably."' He speaks on the one hand of Oliver Cromwell- a phenomenon which "this poor slumberous canting age" can no longer understand-striving to make his acts of Parliament "emblems of God's Law Book," and on the other of Voltaire, the prince of persiflage, "for whom life and all that pertains to it has at best but a despicable meaning."' He finds combined in his own time the belief that the universe is not divine, but merely a machine, and the "indistinct notion that right and wrong are not eternal but accidental, and settled by uncertain votings and talkings." II What features specially arrest one's attention in this treatment of religious phenomena ? i. In demanding a single explanatory principle for all forms of worship our author may be compared with modern "psychologists of religion." But he has kept quite clear of one seductive fallacy by which work in this field is often beset, and which has made the "scientific" results of even such a writer as Professor James seem vapid and unreal to the concretely religious mind. Carlyle nowhere confuses the essence of religion with that abstract residuum which is left over when the individual differences of all cults have dropped out of the reckoning. He was far removed from that courteous latitudinarianism which affects to be a product of the very latest psychology, but which has really descended to us from the eighteenth-century deists.

Voltaire.</page><page sequence="10">52 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY omnibus, or Securus iudicat orbis terrarum was no test of truth for him. Nor did either of these become a better test when it was applied, as is the fashion today, to the feelings and emotions rather than to the intellectual beliefs of mankind. Carlyle was perhaps saved from this delusion by his horror, at least equal to Professor Bergson's, of applying mechanical and arithmetical measurement to the processes of life. For example, one could not imagine him admitting such an argument as that the expecta- tion of personal immortality cannot be vitally religious because it is absent from Hebraism, or that the idea of a personal God must be among the religious accidents because it was not taught by Buddha. He would have held that both these tenets are to be judged, not by their title to ubiquity, but by their fitness to meet that spiritual need in which all religions take their rise. What Carlyle sought was not so much a common element in the faiths of the world as a common impulse behind them. As Teufelsdrtickh puts it: "Let any Cause-and-Effect philosopher explain, not why I wear such and such a garment, obey such and such a law, but even why I am here to wear and obey anything."' So far, however, from attempting to discover the spiritual impulse of religion by eliminating the doctrinal content of religions, he knew that this impulse must reveal itself as doctrinally embodied. The embodi- ments, no doubt, all failed in some degree to clothe the spirit; but only through them could the spirit itself be identified. 2. It was in perfect harmony with this view, but in striking contrast to the method of the comparative psychologists, that Carlyle would interpret lower cults in terms of higher, not vice versa. This is all the more notable because few writers have been equally explicit in recognizing the unity of all faiths. To him it appeared axiomatic-however he may have fallen away from the principle in practice-that every religious mind should be able to understand every other. "A soul of man is like the souls of all other men, and everywhere in Nature deep calls unto deep."2 He thought it the one disqualification for discussing any form of faith that the critic should himself be faithless. Thus Voltaire's chief 3 Sartor, Book I, chap. v. 2 Historical Sketches, "The Colchester Prophets."</page><page sequence="11">CARLYLE'S CONCEPTION OF RELIGION 53 offense in the eyes of Carlyle was that of having "intermeddled in religion without being himself in any measure religious."' In short, he had to an intense degree that human sympathy which Matthew Arnold has so well expressed:" Children of men! the Unseen Power whose eye For ever doth accompany mankind, Hath looked on no religion scornfully Which man did ever find. That man must still to some new worship press Doth in his eye ever but serve to show The depth of that consuming restlessness Which makes man's deepest woe. But his impartial respect for every sincere worship did not lead him, as it might easily have done, into that foolishness which has been committed by modern psychologists through their equally impartial contempt. He would not, for example, "explain" the faith of Fichte by putting together in a more complicated and ingenious system elements which he had collected from a study of the cult of Odin and Thor. He would have thought this as absurd as to attempt an explanation of modern mathematics through the first efforts at figuring by tribesmen of the woods. If religion is a genuine activity of the human spirit, there is no ground to doubt that it will be equally progressive with other activities, and that in time features will disclose themselves of which the germ can scarcely be recognized at an earlier period. But if the continuity is to be recognized at all, Carlyle saw that the interpreter must proceed backward and not forward. As Plato would have put it, we may decipher the inscription when we get. it in large letters though it baffles us in small. As we study the religious nisus in its most mature and intelligent expression, we obtain the clue by which the first feeble gropings become significant and intelligible.

The white European mocks; but ought rather to consider, and see whether he at home could not do the same thing a little more wisely."' 3. It is surely a high merit in Carlyle that he should have in- sisted with such ringing emphasis upon the moral element as the differentia of the higher religions. One need not here enter into his general view of morality further than to recall his insistence upon the incommensurable character of good and evil. In fierce protest against Bentham and the Utilitarians he laid it down that right conduct differs from wrong, not in the quantity of pleasure it produces, either to the agent himself, or to anyone else, not in any sort of consequences which may be calculated by an emotional arithmetic, but in the intrinsic nature of the act itself. He was a Puritan of the Puritans. He loved Kant's comparison of the majesty of the moral law to that of the starry heavens, even as he loathed the "profit-and-loss morality" which would balance alterna- tives, "grind out Virtue from the husks of pleasure," and manu- facture a rectitude by ingeniously co-ordinating the acts of a community of rogues.3 To him the path of duty was always clear, calculated goodness was really vice, and every casuist was ana- thema. When he told his anxious mother, a Presbyterian of the stern Burgher sect, that his views of life were the same as hers, varying only in the mode of expression, he seems to have said neither more nor less than the truth.4 No doubt he pushed his theory of intuitions much too far. A glance at his doctrine of punishment in the second article of Latter Day Pamphlets should be a warning to those who think that consequences can be ignored in a moral decision. But he was surely right in his insistence that a theistic view of the world is not readily adopted by those who look upon the difference of right and wrong as a mere contrast of feeling. Its natural affinity is with the ethic which rests upon reason. The sensitive nature is infinitely variable, and one man's French Revolution, Book I, chap. ii. 2 Historical Sketches, Book II, chap. xxii. 3 Sartor, Book II, chap. vii. 4 Froude, Early Life of Carlyle, chap. v.</page><page sequence="13">CARLYLE'S CONCEPTION OF RELIGION 55 emotion cannot, as such, claim authority over another's. If the moral judgment is to be objective in the same sense in which science is objective, it must rest upon rational axioms as to "the good" and "the bad." And the objectivity of such axioms almost ceases to be intelligible unless the world-process is conceived as controlled by a Moral Will. The historical development of sys- tems in our own day has gone far to confirm Carlyle's conviction that belief in God is intimately bound up with belief in conscience as a function, not of the feelings, but of the reason. III Pantheism is a word whose vagueness constitutes what Mr. Bradley would call a "philosophical scandal." Yet when Sterling used it as a reproach against Carlyle, we have a fairly clear idea of what he had in mind. To the churchman God was a being who feels and wills, who forms purposes, who takes a side in the human struggle, who hearkens to prayer, who cares for the individual rather than for the mass, and who will bestow upon each of his faithful children the life everlasting. Was the deity in Sartor all this ? On that sultry dog-day in the Rue Saint-Thomas de l'Enfer Teufelsdrdickh reached the spiritual crisis through which he was led to his "Evangel." "The Universe is not dead and demoniacal, a charnel-house with spectres; but godlike and my Father's."' On divine fatherhood all Christianity rests. But Carlyle goes on to perplex us with phrases that are very remote from such a conception. How, for example, can a deity who is out of time be said to form purposes, or to hear prayers ? From what sort of religious stand- point does it become of no consequence whether the individual is happy or unhappy, provided the cosmic scheme is allowed to fulfil itself ?2 In what sense of the word "just" is it possible to say that "in this Universe there is nothing else than justice"?3 How exactly is "all contradiction solved" in the Everlasting Yea "Love not pleasure; love God," especially when we are told that the God SSartor, Book II, chap. ix. 2 Past and Present, Book III, chap. iv; cf. French Revolution, Book II, chap. i. 3 Ibid., Book I, chap. ii.</page><page sequence="14">56 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY in question reveals himself sufficiently through the facts of the natural order ? What species of immortality is that which we reach by simply discovering that time itself is unreal ?' And is not perhaps the gravest doubt of all suggested when we remember that Goethe was Carlyle's prophet of the faith, and that the difficulties of the Christian religion were to be elucidated from Faust ? But we can very easily press these objections too far. Like the Calvinists whom he admired, Carlyle was given to philoso- phizing his theology. It would be unfair, for example, to charge Calvin with disbelief in a moral God merely because he ventured a doctrine of election which we can now see to have been wholly incompatible with justice. It would be equally wrong to suspect "pantheism" in those Puritans who exalted divine sovereignty till they had really made the Most High the author of all evil not less than of all good, glorifying himself alike in the harvest and in the pestilence, responsible for the character of Caesar Borgia in the same sense as for that of St. Paul. It is a cardinal sin of present-day critics to attribute to a writer, not the opinions which he avows, but opinions which in their judgment are legitimate inferences from something he has said, even though these inferences may be expressly contradicted by what he has said elsewhere. Carlyle indeed spoke of this uni- verse as being through and through just. So does many a pious clergyman, with an optimism like that of Dr. Pangloss in Candide, equally unaware that, if " the just" be that natural order which we see, then the moral consciousness of man is at once discredited, and with it that faith in a higher order of which conscience is our most authentic token. If our author spoke of God as timeless, and invoked for theological purposes the Kantian abstraction of " thing- in-itself," he used language which was once very much on the lips of orthodox Christians, and he can hardly be blamed for ignoring difficulties which English metaphysicians had scarcely even begun to point out. The theologians, too, were speaking against naive anthropomorphism, reminding us how one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. Dean Mansel, a generation later, advanced a doctrine with far more negative 1 Sartor, Book III, chap. viii.</page><page sequence="15">CARLYLE'S CONCEPTION OF RELIGION 57 implications, when he distinguished in kind between divine moral- ity and human: "In his moral attributes, no less than in the rest of his infinite being, God's judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out."' But his critics, while arguing that Mansel was unaware of the upshot of this, never used it to prove that he was not genuinely a theist. And Mansel was a technically trained philosopher, to be tried by a far more rigorous standard than one applies to a general man of letters. Carlyle must be his own interpreter, and innumerable passages of limpid clearness on this subject should more than discount a few vague metaphysical phrases. The whole tenor of his thought proclaims one whose faith in God was central. He looks wistfully back to the day when this creed was not even questioned, and forward-as to the world's only hope-to the day when it shall be regained. It is a far cry from Sartor to The Loves of the Angels, and the Chelsea prophet had little in common with Tom Moore; but one recalls the stanza: When earth was nearer to the skies Than in these days of crime and woe, And mortals saw without surprise In the mid air angelic eyes Bending upon this world below. For the transfigured return of such a time Carlyle never ceased to hope. "God is in heaven still," he exclaims, "whether Henry Brougham and Jeremy Bentham know it or not."
