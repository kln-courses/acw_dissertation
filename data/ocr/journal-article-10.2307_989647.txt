CURTIS Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Harvard University Styles, like languages, differ in the sequence of articulation and in the number of questions they allow the artist to ask.... E. H. Gombrich1 Le Corbusier was obsessed with creating the prototypes of a new era of harmony for the industrial city. His solutions to individual commissions were often laden with urbanistic principles which he sometimes demonstrated at the expense of a more immediate practicality. By digging into the design process of Pavillon Suisse, we may sense how Le Corbusier translated the given program and site into the terminology of his own dream, how he coped with compromises and attacks on his ideal intentions, and how he adjusted and extended an architectural language that was already mature. In particular we are better able to gauge the way standard elements, such as the pilotis, were "re-thought" to embody new levels of meaning. H ISTORIANS have customarily treated Le Corbusier's Pavil- ion Suisse of 1930-193I as a transitional building standing between the "Purist" tendencies of the twenties and the "Primi- tivist" characteristics of the thirties. This essay will be concerned less with defining phases in Le Corbusier's oeuvre than with unravelling the intentions behind a single work. Broadly speak- ing the aim is to explain why these particular forms were em- ployed in this situation. To answer such a question even approxi- mately one must reconstruct the process of design. In the case of the Pavillon Suisse the evidence for the design process is consid- erable and includes drawings, letters, notes, and reminiscences.2 Description and architectural promenade Pavilion Suisse is well known to many who never have been to Paris through the remarkable drawings and photographs of Le Corbusier's Oeuvre complete, Volume z (Figs. I, z).3 Here it stands some pages after the Villa Savoye and a little way before the urban schemes of the early thirties, as yet another statement of mature principle. As usual the black and white photograph is employed as a rhetorical aid to give a highly select set of vignettes. Nearby buildings are left out of the account, the greenery of the site is accentuated, and a soft sunlight, more related to Mediter- ranean mythology than to Parisian reality, bathes the forms. Evidently this is the way the architect himself wanted his creation to be seen. He presents us with a finely proportioned steel and glass box poised on robust concrete pilotis, facing south over a field destined to become an athletics ground. Student rooms are freshly cleaned and conjure up that combined atmosphere of liner cabin and monastic cell the architect so admired. Carefully composed groups of young men in shirt sleeves are strategically placed so that they may casually demonstrate the role of the pilotis as liberators of terrain and circulation. These photographs give us glimpses into an ideal world of healthy bodies and healthy minds, in which mechanization and nature run along in harmony, and those "essential joys" of space, light, and greenery are available to all. The picture is filled out and modified if one visits the site today. Pavillon Suisse is not an isolated building, but a terminating incident in a larger whole-that international park which is the Cite Universitaire (Figs. 3, 4). It stands alongside a number of unfortunate essays in "national" imagery from the twenties. The approach is liable to be along a tree-lined drive with a turning circle at the end of it. The lower curved rubble wall echoes the shape of this roadway, roots the building to the ground, and contains the main communal function, now a lounge (originally a dining hall); the quarters of the concierge also stand at ground floor level. These lower elements are surmounted by another curved shape, a sort of flange, containing stairs and lavatories and coated at one end in glass brick. This abuts the main box containing the access corridors to the students' rooms, the domi- nant element of the design. It stands in tense relationship to the curves, a rigorous and silent critic of the numerous pastiches of the same arrangement since put up worldwide. Steel framed, the box is wrapped in a stone veneer: only the south side is fully I. Ernst H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion, London, 1977, 78. z.

The approach as one leaves the drive is a carefully orchestrated "promenade" of a kind familiar from the villas of the twenties. One is guided gradually past the glazing to one end of the lounge and towards views of the landscape cut out between the pilotis. One ascends shallow steps to a slightly raised podium on which the main box sits. It is a place with a dignified air which is enhanced by the sober character of the concrete supports, broad but never dumpy, receding in perspective. They form a sort of portico towards the center point of the box. To enter the build- ing one has to circle back through the structure and thread be- neath the superstructure on a diagonal path. One then penetrates the hall and glimpses a series of transparent planes which allow a clear inspection of the options for movement. The stairs, off to the left, are most inviting, and draw one up into the flange seen in the first views, prior to feeding one onto the various landings and corridors. Throughout this sequence one recalls Le Corbusier's dictum that "... architecture can be judged as dead or living by the degree to which the rule of movement has been disregarded or brilliantly exploited."4 The dynamic play of the main volumes seems to illustrate the difference between functions, but also the path that it is intended one should follow. Pavilion Suisse as a transitional building Along the route from public path to private room one is con- fronted by various firm reminders of Le Corbusier's much-dis- cussed changes of emphasis in style since the Purist phase of the twenties. The white cylinders of earlier pilotis have here given way (under the main box) to squat creatures of bare concrete, complex curvature, and anthropomorphic character.5 The hori- zontal strip windows and bands of white stucco of the canonical villas have been replaced by fully glazed "glass walls" (pans de verre). A stern restriction on the range of textures and materials used has yielded to an obvious enjoyment of the contrasting qualities of steel and stone facing, of rubble and glass brick, of planar glass areas and surfaces of varying concrete aggregate. The usual roster of "explanations" for such changes in style is well enough known. We hear that human bodies impinged more on Le Corbusier's consciousness in his middle years than they had hitherto, or that parallel piped bottles and machine parts lost something of their hold over his imagination. We gather that his capitalist sympathies softened up and that "Syndicalism" seemed more soothing; and somehow or another this switch in "ideology" is supposed to have led to a greater love of "organi- cism," or curvaceous "natural" forms. Or it is occasionally 4. Le Corbusier, Talks with Students, New York, 1961, 46. 5. Of course, cylindrical pilotis were not the only sort that Le Cor- busier employed in the twenties; for example, in the Centrosoyus scheme, ca. 1929, pilotis of an oval plan form were used.</page><page sequence="3">CURTIS: LE CORBUSIER'S PAVILLON SUISSE, 1930-1931 297 Fig. z.

The point in general is to remain suspicious of any kind of oversimplified statement about cause and effect. The internal chemistry of Le Corbusier's style was anything but simple. It is not sufficient just to credit such an artist with a vague new form volition or else to take another extreme and expect major changes in morphology automatically to reflect major shifts in belief. Similarly one has to be wary of the sort of argument which emphasizes an interest, on the part of the creator, in new "sources." It is very probable that the "organic" profiles of the pilotis at Pavillon Suisse do reflect a fascination, on some level, with the structure of bones or shells or some other natural "ob- jects with a poetic character" (objets a' reaction poetique) but such things had preoccupied the artist for a number of years. Why was it here that this particular form tendency chose to come so clearly into the open? But if there were changes at Pavillon Suisse there were also, most definitely, continuities with earlier works. The grammar was still firmly based on the principles of "the Five Points of a New Architecture" (pilotis, free plan, free faCade, strip window, roof terrace), even if the accentuation was altogether different from the earlier works. The well-worn theme of the box on stilts was clearly in evidence and the plan shapes offer numerous pos- sible finds for those whose hobby it is to compare the outlines of bathrooms with those of painted guitars. Pavillon Suisse, more- over, was surely another fragment of Le Corbusier's ideal social dreams, a suggestion of the direction society might take. In it, he extended his generic themes and his earlier vocabulary, blending and adapting them with new discoveries appropriate (in his mind) to the new situation. This is where an examination of the design process proves specially valuable, for it reveals a style at work. By scrutinizing the evidence of drawings one may begin to grasp a hierarchy of different intentions in a most rich and com- plex work of architecture. The client's intentions and the site Before the architect was involved there was a program, and before a program, a social purpose which stemmed in this case from members of the Swiss elite living in Paris. The Cite Universi- taire itself embodied a number of loosely framed ideals. From its foundation in 19I2 the practical intention of providing decent 6. Since the author himself has indulged in most of these folkloric observations about Le Corbusier's changes in style ca. 1929-193z, he will not attempt to trace them to any particular invidious source. 7.

Each nation was to have its own house in a sort of miniature and studious version of the League of Nations; its young visitors to Paris would thus be freed from the disadvantages of garret ac- commodation. The "Cite" was to be supplied with sports fields and parks, yet was to have easy and swift access by rail to the main centers of the Sorbonne. Something of this enlightened spirit can be traced in a report written in December 1929 by the "Comite de la Colonie Suisse de Paris pour la Fondation d'une Maison a la Cite Universitaire."s Describing the "Cite" as a whole the report stated: This institution is put forward to provide students with a foyer, where, for a reasonable fee, they may find a moral, safe and reassuring atmos- phere, an agreeable place to stay, and good food, all in the best condi- tions of hygiene and well being. The Cite already includes a number of residences set about with gardens and all sorts of other facilities, such as lecture halls, playing fields, etc.... It is really a sort of little cosmopolitan city which is coming into existence behind the Montsourris park.9 The committee was glad to play its part in such a scenario. It emphasized the stimulating role of Paris as a cultural center and the importance of friendships for young Swiss, as these might later bloom into idealistic and commercial alliances. The even- tual building should provide a suitable setting for these noble aims and do "honor to our country."10 The Swiss colony in France has always demonstrated its attachment to the Mother Country by its acts, and will certainly not withhold its support from bringing to fruition a work destined to render such an outstanding service to our country, namely, the formation of the intellec- tual elite of the future." Such an aim was liable to appeal to the man the committee was soon to choose, without competition, as their architect. It was in June 1930 that Le Corbusier was first approached by Monsieur R. Fueter, a professor of mathematics from Zurich and the acting president of "le Curatorium de la Maison Suisse dans la Cite Universitaire de Paris."'12 It seems that, behind the scenes, Le Corbusier had been strongly backed for the job by Karl Moser, architect, and Sigfried Giedion, historian; however, as Moser implied in a brief note to Le Corbusier, there were other "fervent orators" in his favor, including an earlier Corbusian client, Raoul La Roche, banker and collector of paintings.'3 La Roche had been extremely pleased with the house designed for him by 8. Dated 5 December 1929. This was evidently a circular to drum up support. The membership committee was drawn from the intellectual and commercial upper crust of the Swiss community in Paris; the Presi- dent was M. Sennhauser. (Document, FLC.) 9.

La cite comprend deja nombre de maisons spacieuses, entour&amp;es de jar- dins, ainsi que des installations de tous genres, des salles de lectures, des terrains de jeu etc.... c'est toute une petite ville cosmopolite qui s'1elve derriere le Parc Montsourris."

Fueter's letter spoke enthusiastically of the "authority" that Le Corbusier's reputa- tion would bring to the project;14 perhaps he and his fellow committee members were aware of the architect's battered feel- ings after the League of Nations fiasco in Geneva. In any case, Le Corbusier accepted. Evidently the Swiss clique in charge of the commission thought of Le Corbusier as "their man," a fellow Swiss, despite the fact that he was now a legalized Frenchman who regarded himself as an international prophet. The letter of invitation also outlined the bare bones of the architectural program, but without making any strong sugges- tions concerning dimensions or the interrelationship of spaces. The residence should contain: An entry, a hall for breakfast, also to act as a lecture room. 41 student rooms (for size and furnishing, see for example, the Japanese pavilion). Rooms for the concierge. z rooms for the director and rooms for the servants. Baths and showers on each floor. 15 In the same letter reference was made to the site and Le Cor- busier was referred to "M. le Ministre Dunant" for further de- tails. Apparently, there were a few extant building plots in the "Cit6" and it is not altogether clear how the eventual one was chosen. This stood to the southeast extremity and was bordered by the rue Benoist Malon to the east, a sliproad running in front of the playing fields to the south, the small Swedish foundation to the west, and a driveway (also running past the Danish and Japanese residences) to the north. Thus Le Corbusier's site was an oblong with its long axis running approximately east-west. It immediately implied a certain ambiguity about "front" and 14. See note I2. 15.

"back" for, while many could be expected to approach along the north driveway on a diagonal, the entire thrust of the site was outwards, to the south, towards the intended playing fields and (in Le Corbusier's mind, no doubt) towards the health-giving rays of the sun. Moreover, the chosen plot had another feature: it stood over some disused quarries, thus necessitating ingenious foundation solutions which were liable to have their repercus- sions in the design. Le Corbusier's initial project Unfortunately there is no extant graphic evidence concerning the architect's earliest ruminations on these givens. There is evi- dence that by zI October 1930 a guiding idea was in existence as on that date Le Corbusier wrote excitedly that the project was "clearly established" (difinitivement ... conqu).16 It appears that a preliminary scheme was further studied in the atelier at 35, rue de Sevres in November and December, and that a more thor- oughly worked out version was then submitted to the client for review in mid-January of 193I.17 Thus one has to work back- wards, as it were, from this proposal and try to reconstruct the guiding ideas behind it. The scheme in question is known through a series of carefully ruled measured plans, elevations, and perspectives now at the Fondation Le Corbusier. These were mailed to M. Fueter on 14 January 193 I, in time for a major review by the Curatorium. The salient features of the intended building show clearly in a site plan a perspective under the pilotis, and a rear perspective done in preparation for the submission (Figs. 5, 6, 7). The student rooms were put on the south side of an oblong box parallel to the playing field border of the site. The remaining functions, includ- ing the concierge's quarters and a gymnasium (which had not been called for), were placed in a sort of box punctured by a terrace. This ancillary volume abutted the main one half-way along its length. However, Le Corbusier had apparently seen fit to place all functions, public and private, above the ground, since the entire scheme was raised up on slender steel supports. The visual effect was somewhat precarious, especially under the box containing the student rooms where there were only four stan- chions. The contrast with the earthbound neighbors was dra- matic as here the ground level was almost entirely free of ob- struction. However, an entrance and some way of getting up were both needed, so a door and a stair were inserted into a curved, fully glazed area protruding beneath the main boxes. It seems worthwhile to consider why Le Corbusier adopted such an approach. Clearly he was intrigued by the relationship and distinction between the public and private worlds of the inhabitants. Apparently he wished to maximize the light and views of the student rooms. Evidently he wished to handle the tricky substructure problems by localizing all the weight on four i6. Note Le Corbusier to R. Fueter, I9 October 1930 (FLC). There are a number of tiny sketches in the correspondence files of the Pavillon Suisse at the FLC experimenting with a quasi-courtyard scheme, and another with rooms on each side of a slab. But there is no evidence whatever that these are by Le Corbusier or, even, when they were done. 17.

If these were aspects of Le Corbusier's rationale they had still to be translated into forms and merged with more nebulous and poetic interpretations. This is where it is intriguing to speculate on the debts of the scheme to earlier solutions and themes. One is not, of course, suggesting that Le Corbusier constructed his ideas by just sticking together the bits and pieces of earlier solutions. At the same time one is not claiming that the order of a new solution was traceable entirely to novel conditions or to singular creative sparks. The truth about invention surely lies between, with old type forms being stretched and agitated into new com- binations on the one hand, and unprecedented conditions being gradually reorganized in terms of a preexisting language on the i8. The length of the foundation pilings of the final building (over 6o feet) points to some of the problems presented by the substructure cav- erns.

JSAH, XL:4, DECEMBER 1981 other. 19 Perhaps one may picture a phase of incubation, in which a gradual synthesis occurred between type forms and new inten- tions. Such a synthesis might be judged "successful" when it could withstand the scrutiny of both external demands and the artist's own intuitive sense of "rightness." Thus it serves only a limited purpose to recount some of the obvious influences on the Pavilion Suisse project of January 193 I. One recognizes first of all the generic theme of the box on stilts, a leitmotif which transcended differences of building func- tion in Le Corbusier's earlier repertoire.20 The interest in proces- sional circulation, the liberation of views beneath a structure, and the use of a curved, glazed undercroft were all features remi- niscent of the then recently completed Villa Savoye.21 Oblong "collective" slabs had of course been employed for work func- tions in the League of Nations' Secretariat, 1927, and were also being envisaged for the more recent, almost contemporary, "set- back" (ei redent) housing schemes of the Ville Radieuse.22 In- deed, one is not surprised to gather that Le Corbusier treated the problem of student accommodation as a subspecies of commu- nal housing, and in the placement of the two boxes, one senses the possible influence of Soviet housing prototypes of the late twenties such as the student housing by K. Nikolayev for Mos- cow of I928.23 The definition of an ideal collective order was a dominating obsession of Le Corbusier's (as has been pointed out a number of times);24 later I shall attempt to show how he co- opted the Pavillon Suisse program in order to transcend it with his own ideological attitudes to this basic issue of the modern industrial city. The scheme of January 193 1 is also interesting for what it tells of Le Corbusier's need to adjust certain of his type forms in new circumstances. After all this was not a villa but a collective dwell- ing of some size, a situation which required modification of some of the "Five Points of a New Architecture." The strip windows for example, were not now treated as dark tiers laid into white stucco horizontals, but as elements which had formally and con- ceptually to blend with a fully glazed fagade. For structural rea- sons Le Corbusier chose to employ a steel frame to manifest his idea, and it may be that he thought such a fagade treatment more honest and evocative. Or, again, he may have found the new system more satisfying in harmonizing whole and part at a large scale. One guesses that Pierre Chareau's recent Maison de Verre may have influenced him, and that the fully glazed fagade of that "cousin" of the Pavillon Suisse, the Maison de Refuge, may have also been on his mind; the latter was in construction at the same time that the Pavillon was being designed. The pilotis also marked a departure from the customary con- crete cylinders that Le Corbusier employed in the twenties.25 Was this a matter of "structural honesty" requiring some exhibi- tion of the steel superstructure? Was there an interest in explor- ing mass production techniques? Were these steel "I" beams employed because they suggested a directionality from one side of the site to another? Was this type of support employed be- cause it did at least provide minimal grooves for the placement of ducts and pipes? Or was this solution used because it engendered a feeling of mechanistic precision? Whatever the combination of practical and metaphorical intentions, the effect of details like this, and of the taut machine age boxes above, was much closer in spirit to the "Purist" phase than to the later "Organicism." There was no sign at all of the elephantine concrete pilotis or the free form curves in rubble of the final building. Pilotis under attack On 18 January 1931 M. Fueter wrote back to Le Corbusier expressing Karl Moser's and his own reactions to the drawings. I have just studied your project with Professor Moser, and we are equally enthused over the genial and classic manner in which you have resolved the problem. The simplicity of the ideas and the harmony of the spaces, above all the unity of the conception, demonstrate your mastery in a striking fashion. I shall be very happy to show your project as soon as possible to the committee, and I don't doubt that everyone will share my admiration.26 Nonetheless, there were practical issues which arose from this initial inspection, such as the suggestion that the gymnastics room might not be needed and the implication that the scheme seemed to overrun the budget. These criticisms were amplified by the observations of the curatorium. To sum up: the client was worried by the placement of the most public areas and the con- 19. It seems important to assert this at a time when "typology" is so frequently invoked as a clue to the formation of vocabulary. The present article was certainly not written as an intentional critique of over-facile definitions of typology in Le Corbusier's work, but it might be read that way. zo.

The student rooms, and their disposi- tion in the slab, were approved meanwhile. In other words, Le Corbusier was being asked to reconsider the ancillary box alto- gether; the hints were more than slight that he place concierge and communal areas at ground level.27 But that was not all: the curatorium admitted that the idea of lifting the building up on pilotis was "very original" but doubted the practical value of such a solution.28 M. Jungo, the Director of Federal Construction, implied that he did not accept Le Cor- busier's rationalizations about limiting the number of founda- tion pilings, and pointed out that the neighboring buildings had been constructed by more "customary and ancient methods."29 He then answered another Corbusian claim which had evidently been used to explain the slender stanchions. Circulation can only be the reason in some small measure for lifting the building up on pilotis. The proposition is very bold and probably very costly compared with many other methods in which the weight would be more evenly distributed. The considerable spans between pilotis are quite astonishing and are not rational.30 Correspondingly, M. Jungo suggested that the pilotis be multi- plied in number, that the foundations be enlarged and that some better system be found for the running of ducts. It is amusing in retrospect to see that his recommendation for the pilotis-that they be wrapped in concrete-implied a return to the more usual Corbusian usage. I wonder if these steel pilotis might not have been wrapped in concrete as this naked steel presents dangers from a number of viewpoints.31 In like manner M. Jungo rejected the fully glazed south fa;ade on the grounds of thermal inadequacy, in favor of "strips of concrete or some other material."32 It was as if Le Corbusier were being asked to turn the clock back to the twenties, when he had more usually employed strip windows set into stuccoed con- crete surfaces. The committee evidently wanted a second opinion, so in early February Dr. M. Ritter of the Ecole Polytechnic Federale in Zurich was consulted. He too was shocked by the structural concept.33 He drew attention to the problem of instability from windloads and to the difficulty of providing foundations for the supports under the ancillary box given that they were off line with the main structure. He too rejected Le Corbusier's vague rationalizations. His remarks were very much to the point: I simply cannot understand the architect's motives in bringing the weight of the building down to the ground on only four supports. Such a solution provides no advantages whatsoever in handling a tricky site. About all it succeeds in lifting up is the cost of the construction, and that considerably. Moreover, a building carried out according to the sug- gested plan does not offer much stability and is liable to be so sensitive to lateral thrusts that one will definitely feel vibrations . . produced by wind pressure."34 M. Ritter argued that it would therefore be far better to in- crease the number of supports to 16 or 32 and to place them under the lateral edges of the slab containing the student rooms as this would make the building safer, cheaper and more con- sistent. He too was puzzled concerning the way in which Le Corbusier meant to bring pipes down to the ground. Indeed, he finished up his letter to M. Jungo with a polite but unambiguous rejection of the whole idea: I allow myself to sum up my thoughts on the project by telling you that I take it to be quite useless in its present form.35 The creation of the ground floor curves It is likely that the full impact of this onslaught was kept from Le Corbusier by the diplomatic barrier of M. Fueter, who was clearly in favor of Le Corbusier's ideas. In any case, by early February the architect had already had time to absorb the sug- gested rearrangements made a week or so before, and to under- stand that the curatorium wanted him to act quickly. Pilotis were not a major concern in a series of sketches done on 3 1 January, in which the architect drastically rearranged the communal areas by bringing them down to the ground level and by enclosing them in a curved outline (Fig. 8). In the largest sketch on the sheet, the outline of the entire building was clearly shown in its original form, except that the circulation was expressed as a sort of rectangular flange detached from the rear of the main slab; in the same image one can see that Le Corbusier changed his mind and bent the element back into a bow-like shape with the stairs at 27. See especially document written by L. Jungo, 23 January 1931, entitled: "Cite Universitaire de Paris. Maison Suisse. Projet Le Corbu- sier"; sections 4 and 6 imply that movement of communal zones to the ground floor will ameliorate many problems of the scheme. (Document at FLC.) z8. See note z7, section 8. 29.

In the sketch to the top right hand of the sheet, this new curved piece was studied in even greater detail, while in the third and smallest sketch (to the top left of the sheet), the ground level was also shown bent into a concave curve. From a merely practical point of view, this was, of course, Le Corbusier's response to the client's suggestion of a social space and concierge's quarters at ground level. But why the curves? Again one can only hypothesize. One guesses that the move to the ground was a quite drastic one in the architect's mind, re- quiring in and of itself an accentuation of volumetric contrast between the earthbound and the suspended. Again, one suspects that he may have felt the earlier box somewhat wooden and crude, in its lack of acknowledgment of the pressures of internal and external circulation. In turn he may have felt it necessary to be more responsive to the context, particularly to the curved driveway, the diagonal line of approach through the "Cite"' and the diagonal of the Rue Benoist Malon to the East. The new forms tended to suggest kinesthetically the direction of move- ment from the surroundings towards the entrance under the slab. However, I believe other issues were at stake as well. The formal contrast served to accentuate still further the contrast of social meaning between the public and the private worlds. The devices employed to reinforce this distinction were in turn rooted in the artist's formal syntax as painter, urbanist, and architect; indeed, patterns of geometrical contrast were frequently em- ployed in all media to reinforce dualities of theme. In architec- tural terms, the new curved walls were obviously relatives of the free plan partitions which Le Corbusier had often dramatically contrasted to rectangular grids of supports in his earlier works. In this particular setting, the curved, earthbound walls allowed a gradual modification from the thick walled setting to the more perforated and transparent world of the hovering box. The relationship of curves to rectangles was found only after some experimentation. In another set of sketches, which appear to be preliminary to those done on 3 I January, one can observe alternatives being tested on a combination of convex, ear-like shapes, and protruding, angular, diagonal ones (Fig. 9). These seem to portray, among other things, the difficulties involved in bringing the diagonal line of approach in under the pilotis, then round and into the building. In this respect they serve to under- line the elegance of the final solution. However, internal issues were also involved, such as the combination of the concierge's quarters with the public areas, also beautifully harmonized by the concave curve. But these tentative explorations of Le Corbusier's are interest- ing on another level. They reveal customary patterns of formal thinking of a sort often found in his paintings to portray such things as the handles on jugs or the outline of human organs. Le Corbusier deliberately evolved a limited number of formal ele- ments in his paintings within certain "rules" of combination, and the same shape might recur in a variety of representational con- texts.36 One might add that, on occasion, Le Corbusier managed to combine more than one reading in a single shape.37 But, to return to the curves of the Pavillon Suisse doodles: is one justified in seeking out a metaphorical level in them? It does, after all, 36. This characteristic of Le Corbusier's formal syntax is discussed by Eduard Sekler, "The Carpenter Center in Le Corbusier's Oeuvre: An Assessment." 37.

One would not, how- ever, expect such a "reference" to be too literal, or simplistic.38 Moreover, the juxtaposition of free form curves containing circulation with rectangular flange-like shapes was not entirely without precedent in Le Corbusier's architectural oeuvre. The most striking similarities, it seems to me, are with the circulation organs (so to say) of the third scheme for the Centrosoyus in Moscow, where the external curves also allowed the delicate combination of a number of oblique site geometries.39 In the earlier League of Nations project, curves were also used in com- bination with rectangular flanges, in this case to contrast cere- monial volumes from the Secretariat areas, or else (in the main faqade) to convey a sense of visual movement corresponding to the main line of movement within. The solarium on top of the Villa Savoye was yet another preceding case of a complex curved geometry being used to respond to a number of visual directions, and to transmit energies towards the horizons. Now, in all of this there was an associative level to "ear-like" curves which was related to what Le Corbusier called, in his later years, "an ac- coustic component in the domain of form."40 By this he meant to imply forms which emitted and received the pressures of the surroundings, and whose shape suggested a tactile equivalent to such pressures. I do not believe it is being too rash to claim that the concave invention of 31 January for Pavillon Suisse was a major addition to Le Corbusier's stock of devices, and to suggest 38.

Courtesy of Fondation Le Corbusier and Garland Publishing, Inc.) that its contextual and visual properties made it an ancestor of the "accoustic" shapes of the chapel at Ronchamp. Certainly in its own individual context it was an ingenious way of reconciling a great number of interior and exterior demands. From "I-beam" to "dog-bone": a tale of pilotis The piloti solution shown in the sketch of 31 January was the same as in the presentation drawings. It is not clear precisely when Le Corbusier turned his attention to his untenable struc- tural solution, or how M. Ritter's stringent criticisms were re- layed to him. However, to judge from the dozens of studies of the ground level undertaken by the Atelier between February and July, the matter became a dominant obsession. Numerous differ- ent alternative treatments-including increasing the number of supports, varying the sizes and types, and using double-legged cradles-were attempted. Since pilotis were such central elements of Le Corbusier's architectural language, there is some value in examining a few of these alternative treatments for what they tell us of his intentions. Here indeed was a case of a "type" element which had to be modified to meet a number of practical, expres- sive and symbolic requirements in a single scheme. Some of the dilemmas between the pragmatic and the ideal emerge if one analyzes a proposal of May 1931 (Fig. io). In this instance the structural supports were made from concrete as the committee recommended. However, to increase stability, a double, splay-legged construction was placed under each end of the main slab. Above these, and running along the slab bottom, was a vertebrate system of girders and beams. This was in turn supported by two squat concrete columns loosely resembling an "M" in plan, and situated so that they flanked the entrance to the ground floor zone. There can be no doubt that this solution was more feasible structurally and in terms of lateral stability than that suggested in January. But these practical requirements were achieved at a cost. The solution led to supports of varying size, to beams of sagging appearance and to an elevation with weak visual emphasis at the ends. Where the January scheme had sacri- ficed utility to formal effect, this version did the opposite. Le Corbusier needed a solution that made sense structurally, that solved the windload problem, that was feasible in terms of its foundations and that could accommodate down pipes and services. At the same time the solution would have to fit his own expressive criteria. For this was an architect who had written, a decade before, that "The purpose of construction is to make things hold together, of architecture to move us,"41 and who might have contributed wholeheartedly to Geoffrey Scott's ob- servation that: "Architecture studies not structure in itself, but the effect of structure on the human spirit."42 More than that, Le Corbusier needed to discover a form for the pilotis which ade- quately embodied his own ideas in this particular work. To judge from the January scheme, he was after a row of even-numbered, almost evenly spaced supports, aligned exactly midway along the bottom of the student residence slab. The middle supports needed to act as a sort of portico to the entrance, and it was important that the overall effect should be a directional screen aimed towards the view. Moreover, the main box should appear poised in space, while the area underneath should have a habitable scale. The relationship between load and support needed to be convincing in tectonic terms (arguably the supports had appeared too thin in the January submission, whatever their actual structural capacity), and the pilotis' shape needed to harmonize with both the circu- lation flow and the main form of the building. In this respect the problem after 31 January had one new major ingredient: the curved and earthbound ground level functions. One suspects that this drastic change in and of itself would have necessitated some change in the pilotis' form, even without the complaints of Jungo and Ritter. The resolution between these expressive criteria and the afore- mentioned practical ones was at last achieved in the summer (the precise date is not clear) in a scheme for the pilotis which became known as "the dog-bone" (Fig. I ).43 In this hypothesis there were three main types of pilotis, all of concrete, repeated for each half of the main slab. Type "no. I" was to stand towards each end and in plan was very like a dog-bone as its sides were formed from two concave curves while its ends swelled outwards to become two knob-like extremities. The two pilotis of type "no. 2z" were to stand about one-sixth of the way in from each end of 41. Le Corbusier, Towards A New Architecture, Paris, 1923, transla- tion F. Etchells, 1929, z3. 42.

Courtesy of Fondation Le Corbusier and Les Editions d'Architecture, Artemis, Zurich) the slab: the sides facing outwards towards the "no. Is" were again concave and curved, but the sides facing inwards towards the center of the slab were carved out as rectangular recesses to receive pipes and ducts. These inner profiles anticipated the cen- termost pilotis called type "no. 3," in which the solid areas be- tween the knobs of the bone were removed altogether resulting in four far more slender pilotis and in a greater effect of trans- parency. The motivations for "bifurcating" the structure in this way are obvious if one turns to the final plan. For by this means an open, habitable space was created at ground level. More than that the slender pilotis made a portico which allowed diagonal views and movement towards the entrance while anticipating the cylindrical pilotis of the interior. Thus the pilotis of the dog-bone solution were each attuned to their particular setting, but seen side-on from a distance they still presented equal thicknesses. They succeeded in reconciling other irreconcilables as well. Broad enough and sufficient enough in number to insure stability, they were also few enough to fit with Le Corbusier's own notion of the ideal foundation solution of deep piles (which he continued to argue was sanctioned by the "Service des Carrieres de la Ville de Paris").44 Solid enough struc- turally to support all the weight, they were not so fat visually as to destroy the poised effect of the main slab; indeed, the dog- bone profile created an accent of shadow between two vertical lines of light and made the pilotis seem less dumpy than they actually were. Aligned under the slab as a single row, they still implied directionality towards the athletics field while respond- ing to diagonal circulation as well. Sufficiently similar in shape, color and material for a unified reading, they were nonetheless adjusted for variable spacing to accentuate the two end bays and the middle one. Masculine, stable, and robust in form, they still made the forces of the design manifest in a way which could be experienced directly through empathy. In that respect they re- called Le Corbusier's earlier characterization of the Doric order as possessing "almost the quality of natural growth."45 Finally the dog-bone solution was "right" in this context because it harmonized with the concave forms of the ground level spaces. This was more than a rhyming effect; it was a coincidence of aim. The new pilotis partook of both worlds of form and meaning: those of the ground level curves and those of the poised box. Little wonder that the solution took so long to discover and that Pierre Jeanneret proclaimed, at the end of 193 x: ... We are glad that we persisted with our system of construction (with very few points of support) despite the strong opposition that we felt on all sides.46 Even then not everyone was convinced: in the fall of 1933, shortly before the building was opened, there were still mut- terings about the possible instability of the structure.47 The image and idea of Pavillon Suisse This essay began with the suggestion that intentions behind a complex work of architecture like PavillonA Suisse might be un- derstood as working in "hierarchies," the most important of them standing close to the core ideas of a design, the secondary ones allowing some greater degree of variation so long as there was no threat to kernel meanings. Evidently Le Corbusier was able to tolerate a major rearrangement like the placement of the communal zone at ground level, because it did not totally destroy the big ideas of the building; indeed, it is even arguable that the move encouraged the artist to find ways of heightening central meanings through contrast. But while he was willing to allow some variation on the disposition of the pilotis, their shape and their size (within the limits of expressive criteria hypothesized earlier), it is extremely unlikely that he would have done without them altogether. On the major theme of a communal box on stilts Le Corbusier would not budge, even under a barrage of quite sensible criticism. Even his own practical arguments in favor of the solution were rather feeble, if not downright unten- able. It seems then that this area of the design lay very close to the main ideas behind the building. Surely he would not have made all this fuss just to preserve some views and pathways between the access drive and the athletic fields?

Courtesy of Fondation Le Corbusier) sophical concerns which transcended the local situation is to be found in the same photographs with which this essay began, the illustrations of the Oeuvre complte, Volume 2 (Fig. 12). In a caption to a view under the pilotis (where a gentleman is shown smoking a pipe) one finds the following: People without imagination still frequently pose this question: "What use are these pilotis?" At the festivities held in the University of Zurich in 1933, Professor Maurin, dean of the Faculty of Sciences for France, said to Le Corbusier: "I have seen the Pavillon Suisse in the Cite Universitaire. Don't you think that the pilotis that you have used might serve to provide the definitive solution to the passage of circulation of a large town?" M. Maurin, physicist, accustomed to working in a laboratory, discovered spontane- ously the rudiments of an urbanistic and architectural doctrine that Le Corbusier had expounded for ten years, without halt, in all his works and his writings.48 It therefore seems fair to regard the Pavillon Suisse, like many earlier and later works by the same architect, as an exploration of an urban ideal.49 I have elsewhere argued that universities, along with monasteries, ocean liners, and collective arrangements based on the Phalanstere of Fourier (sources suggested by other scholars) were among Le Corbusier's paradigms when it came to formulating an ideal for collective life.50 In the case of the Cite Universitaire, the ground was right for such explorations, since the setting as a whole had been conceived in reaction to the slum accommodations then normal for foreign students visiting Paris. Le Corbusier took these local hints embedded in the program and universalized them: he used the opportunity to explore cer- tain of his own theoretical correctives to the choking and filthy conditions of modern urban life. The site he was given was itself highly conducive to such treat- ment, for it looked south over greenery and playing fields. In that respect the parallel with Le Corbusier's ideal housing type for the "Radiant City-" the ta redent housing-was exact (Figs. 13, i4).51 These too were glazed on the south side and made to stand in a park amply supplied with the "essential joys" of space, light, and greenery; these too had flat roofs for relaxation and exercise; these too had an open ground level under pilotis permitting the flow of pedestrians, the growth of plants, the passage of motor- ized traffic.

"., e:: busier found them in the residential proposals of his ideal city; presented with the givens of program and site, he transformed them into the terminology of his own myth. Thus the Pavillon Suisse was a sort of demonstration of ur- banistic principles as well as a highly resolved individual work of architecture. The corollary was that it acted as a species of labora- tory in which urban solutions could be tried out on a smaller scale. As Le Corbusier wrote in the introduction to the Oeuvre complkte, Volume z: Henceforth I shall no longer speak of the architectural revolution which has been achieved. Now it is the era of large works, the period when urbanism becomes the dominant concern. ... So what have we done in these years 1929-1934? First of all a few buildings, then many large scale urbanistic studies. These buildings have played the role of laboratories. We wanted each element of construction during that pe- riod to be the experimental proof which would allow us to take the necessary urbanistic initiatives with complete assurance.52 The clients may not have been aware of these multiple under- lying meanings of the Pavillon Suisse, though they were certainly right in sensing that Le Corbusier had strong and, so to say, "irrational reasons" of his own for clinging so tenaciously to his pilotis. But they did recognize the extraordinary probity of their new building and did sense that it was the manifestation of a broad philosophical vision. In a report made on the final project they wrote: The architecture of the building expresses the aspirations of our epoch, which tend towards a new ideal ... it adheres with an almost brutal frankness to forms arising from the means of construction. The general lines are simple and calm.53 Indeed, M. Fueter, Le Corbusier's unwavering supporter through thick and thin, and without whom the building might never have been completed, recognized that the Pavillon Suisse was liable to have seminal importance: The committee was completely charmed and delighted by your fourth (final) project; it believes that the residence conceived by you will give our country the greatest honor and will mark an era in human develop- ment.54 52.

For, without clients of vision, the task of architects of vision is made all the more difficult. Reflections on the notion of style I have concentrated on the design process of the Pavillon Suisse because it illustrates so well the general contention that innova- tions in Le Corbusier's architectural language are best under- stood not by appealing to vague theories of stylistic or ideologi- cal change, but by digging deep into the context and intentions project was the final one; intermediary versions with different pilotis and room arrangements had been shown to the client in the spring. 55. Letter Fueter to Le Corbusier, 27 December 1932 (FLC): "Je ne peux pas terminer ma lettre sans vous dire encore comme je suis ravis de votre maison suisse qui est de toute maniere parfaite. Je vous remercie chaleureusement de tout ce que vous avez fait et ferez encore. Je crois qu'on serait unanime chez nous a reconnaitre l'6norme valeur artistique de votre oeuvre." unique to a case. In general, what is needed is an explanation for formal invention which balances the internal tendencies towards certain patterns of form and meaning within a personal style, with the constraints and opportunities offered by the outside world. Le Corbusier found the forms and details of the Pavillon Suisse by a gradual extension and testing of solutions whose validity in other contexts he already knew; but the new context stretched his categories and presented him with new stimuli and new conflicts-and the latter could only be resolved by inventing new forms, or, at any rate, new variations on old ones. Even then further modifications were necessary, as elements were adjusted to harmonize with the individual building's guiding ideas, with what Le Corbusier once called "the rules of the game" of the new creative organism.s6 An order had to be found which transcended any merely additive assembly of earlier type solutions in its power to blend parts and whole, form and content, on a number of different levels, and so to embody, in symbolic form, a frag- ment of Le Corbusier's utopia. 56.
