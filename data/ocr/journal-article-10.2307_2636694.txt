In the half century that followed, archaeologists were able to collect together large amounts of information and to demonstrate, with the aid of radiocarbon dating, that the first farming communities were established in the subcontinent by 200 A. D., thus adding more than a millennium to earlier interpretations, which had negro warriors storming across the Limpopo at much the same time that the Dutch were sowing the seeds of civilisation at the Cape. 2 Yet despite the volume of work that has been completed, archaeology in southern Africa has until recently remained impoverished of theory. Most writers have relied on a simple model of southerly migration - which links together race, language, ceramics and economy - to account for farming origins,' despite the fact that race is almost obsolete in physical anthropology,4 language history for the continent appears increasingly complex, 5 archaeological work in other areas has shown ethnic readings of ceramics to be simplistic6 and economy is clearly a matter of adaptation to local circumstances rather than a vehicle on which migrating populations can ride across thousands of kilometers, irrespective of environment. 7 The conventional historiography of the pre-colonial southern African past, set out clearly in a number of overviews,8 is based on the distinction between a Later Stone ' For a recent overview of the southern African Iron Age, see T.

The Iron Age is seen as the archaeological manifestation of the southerly migration of Bantu-speaking, Negro immigrants, and is further divided, on the basis of changes in ceramic design, between the Early Iron Age and the Late Iron Age. Elsewhere 9 I have argued that this model was derived from unsophisticated assump- tions made by European and American archaeologists earlier this century, and is an empirical classificatory system that does not bear critical, theoretical assessment. More recently, however, a number of writers have begun to look for new ways of explaining the past. One approach is founded in structuralist principles, and attempts to establish 'cognitive systems' which can be discerned ethnographically and traced into the past through diagnostic characteristics of rock art 10 or settlement architec- ture. " This school of thought has led to highly cogent interpretations of complex painted panels'2 and of Great Zimbabwe itself, '3 but it also contains a number of inherent difficulties, of which perhaps the most. severe is an inability to cope systematically with change. 1 An alternative road is that of historical materialism. Materialist analysis is no stranger in the study of pre-colonial southern Africa, for a number of archaeologists have attempted innovative studies on a local scale, 1' while historians have argued for lineage, tributary and other modes of production in the explanation of the Swazi, Zulu and other kingdoms of the subcontinent. 16 But apart from cursory and specula- tive consideration of the earlier nature of social formations, '7 there has been no attempt to extend such general interpretations back to the early first millennium. This lack of application of materialist theory is to some extent the result of a methodological problem. For whereas forces of production can often be discerned through conventional archaeological evidence, the other essential component of any mode of production - the relations of production - are disconcertingly elusive without recourse to the circularity of ethnographic analogy. 9 Hall, 'Burden of tribalism'; M.

Giddens emphasises the importance of the exercise of power in social life, for '. . . to be an agent is to be able to deploy (chronically, in the flow of daily life) a range of causal powers, including that of influencing those deployed by others'. 18 Power in this sense is not a resource which can be gained by, for instance, a dominant class; it is rather a relation exercised through rules and resources. This concept has been developed further, and in the context of archaeo- logical theory, by Miller and Tilley. 19 Giddens has argued that such power relations are made concrete, or signified, often by the use of material symbols. This is supported in a recent study by Hodder. in which he shows how material culture carries symbols which take an active part in forming and giving meaning to social behaviour. Hodder has gone on to argue that material culture is particularly relevant to the study of power relations because, '. unlike much action and speech it has duration. It lasts, and so in a very direct way it channels and organises perception and behaviour . . . it is through material culture and its spatial organisation in homes that individuals come to grasp meanings and relations in society. Material culture is itself, then, an important force in the regeneration of ideology and power. It has inherent properties which can lead to the naturalisation of power relations and authority'. 20 In the discussion that follows I hope to show both that materialist theory, operationalised as a set of modes of production, can advance understanding of the precolonial history of southern Africa, and that material culture can be used to identify the nature of relations of production. The Primitive Communist Mode of Production It seems feasible to differentiate three modes of production relevant to southern African precolonial social formations. Firstly, a 'Primitive Communist Mode of Production' can be defined by the constitution of the relations of production in interactions between individuals who form domestic groups; '. . . the product of any given labour process is distributed among the producers and others through the intervention of determinate social relations between the individuals concerned'. 21 From the character of these dominant relations of production follows an absence of classes, complex division of labour or accumulation of the product on a substantial scale by individuals or specific segments of the community. An immediate question, and one that is central in the present context, is whether both agriculture and hunting/gathering can be forces of production within the 18 A.

Hirst, Precapitalist Modes of Production (London, 1975), p. 44.</page><page sequence="4">4 Journal of Southern African Studies primitive communist mode. Meillassoux maintained that such a distinction in the forces of production has to be reflected in the mode as a whole: 'At a low stage of development of the productive forces, when human energy is the only form of energy available and when toolmaking requires comparatively little labour investment, the use of land as subject of labour amounts solely to the extraction of the necessities of life from it, as it is with the case of hunting or collecting. At a higher stage of the development of productive forces, as in agriculture, man, with the expectation of a later return, invests his labour into the land, which therefore becomes an instrument of labour'. 22 But others have objected to Meillassoux's stress on the determinate role of produc- tive forces, pointing out that this implies that change in a social formation dominated by the primitive communist mode can only come through technological 'discoveries' by individuals or from external forces. 23 Despite their objection to his theoretical position, Hindess and Hirst recreated Meillassoux's distinction, contrasting two distinct variants within the primitive communist mode as 'simple redistribution' and 'complex redistribution', typified respectively by ad hoc relations of redistribution and permanent relations of redistribution through 'the location of individuals at determinate points in a more or less extended network of kinship and marriage relations'. 24 But this position has also proved untenable. As Keenan has pointed out, the fluctuations in resources and the risk of their failure make connections between hunter-gatherer bands essential; relations of production that may be structured as 'an ideology, as a symbolic code for expressing relations between men, and between men and nature'. 25 Wiessner, in her study of reciprocity between !Kung San communities, provides an excellent example of such relations of production in action. Risk is contained by the 'storage' of social obligations in hxaro alliances between individuals, marked by the delayed exchange of gifts. Within the camp, such relationships smooth income differences; between neighbouring camps, they allow frequent visits and sharing; and between distant camps they allow sustained visits: 'Hxaro paths wind through both camps and cores of these close relatives, thereby making them into nodes in the hxaro network, and travel through many camps over hundreds of kilometers.'26 Relations of production such as these do not appear to be structurally distinct from the patterns of interaction between some agricultural communities; relations of reciprocity such as the hxaro may have a different form to kinship, but the effect - the managing of risk within non-accumulative social formations - is much the same. Thus the primitive communist mode of production may span the conventional divide between the Stone Age and Iron Age, suggesting that communities that have so far been considered structurally distinct might in fact be analysed as within the same mode of production. I do not in this wish to imply that hunting/gathering and farming 22 C. Meillassoux, 'From reproduction to production.

This connection has been in part recognised by David Lewis-Williams, who has identified the crucial role of the medicine man in the social process: 'Consumption is as important as production, and the San rules of distribution complement the exploitation of resources. Every man hunted, but the chance nature of hunting meant that not everyone was equally successful; the inequalities of production were counterbalanced by the sharing practices. The curer was therefore not merely healing the bodies of sick individuals or reducing private animosities; he was also keeping the social relations within the production process in good order and ensuring the essential distribution of the comparatively scarce resource of meat'. 30 Thus, through the trance dance, the medicine man performed 'symbolic labour' that represented general cooperation within the camp. In addition, the medicine man's facility of 'out-of-body travel' when in trance established the rights in reciprocity between camps which were essential to survival. Rock paintings, and in particular the meaning carried by key symbols, 'held in perpetuity what was otherwise an intermittent activity'. 31 This reading of southern African rock art reinforces Hodder's point that all material culture may carry symbols of importance in power relations. 32 Thus the stale distinction between 'style' and 'function' in artefactual analysis becomes redundant, for any artefact may signify a complex set of power relations. This realisation allows a reassessment of the role of ceramics; artefacts that have been viewed as, for example, tribal markers, indicators of 'culture', coincidental with language distributions or indicators of ethnicity. For, seen as potential carriers of symbols that signify power relations, ceramics may be particularly informative about connections between households in southern Africa. 2 M.

The price of the higher productivity of the cereal crops introduced by the beginning of the first millennium A.D. was reduced species diversity and greater ecological instability and, although households using the new crops would have been able to support more members with a reduced degree of mobility than those still reliant on gathering and hunting, the risk of resource failure would have been higher, demanding a concomitant securing of reciprocity. In addition the potential for storing resources such as grain was limited. 3 Given these circumstances, coupled with Lewis-Williams' demonstration of the vital mediating role of symbolic labour and its material signification in rock art among households with, if anything, a lesser need for the security of reciprocal relations, there is every reason to predict the signification in material culture of relations of power between farming households which had no certain mechanisms for storing resources against future needs. Clearly, this proposition cannot be fully tested against the ethnographic record, for all communities now have a degree of access to market economies which, to some extent, will solve the problem of accumulation. However, Hodder's study of the use of material culture symbols by the Kenyan Dorobo provides some interesting indicators. The name 'Dorobo' means a 'person without cattle', and is used to refer to hunter-gatherers and forest-dwellers. However, Dorobo have always lived in close association with cattle; indeed many Dorobo were once herdsmen. Dorobo carry out extensive trade with Maasai and Samburu cattle-keepers, acquiring stock of their own in some cases. But the nature of this interaction with trading partners has varied from region to region. Thus there have been tensions between the Lonkewan Dorobo and Samburu herders, while Kisima and other Dorobo groups 'followed a different path. Here the economic strategy was one of non-competitive symbiosis and integration. Hunter-gatherer and host tribe exchanged products and became incor- porated within one system. Some cattle were obtained by the hunter-gatherers, but the overall result, encouraged by government administration, was a gradual break- down of cultural and tribal differences by intermarriage and assimilation'. 36 The Dorobo case tests experimentally the southern African proposition, for the Lonkewan households, with the contradiction of conflict with their neighbours and the simultaneous need to trade with their neighbours, should need to signify their interdependence through material culture, while other Dorobo households have no such requirement. Indeed, Hodder found that this was the case, discerning differen- ces between Lonkewan Dorobo and Samburu households in a range of material culture items, such as necklace and ear decorations, that were also explicitly recognised by those who used them. In contrast there were no observable material culture differences between Kisima Dorobo and the Samburu households with which they freely traded and mixed. Hodder has interpreted the Dorobo case as an example of 'ethnic manipulation', with communities exercising, or relaxing, their use of material culture symbols 3 Hall, Role of cattle. 36 Hodder, Symbols in action, p. 102.</page><page sequence="7">Archaeology &amp; Modes of Production in Pre-Colonial Southern Africa 7 according to the wider context of their economies. However, the unstated corollary of this interpretation is that the Lonkewan Dorobo used distinct material symbols to affirm their interdependence in a hostile environment while other Dorobo had no need for such signification. Thus the Dorobo case further strengthens the expectation of finding a material system of signification attached to the archaeology of early farming households in southern Africa. Other ethnoarchaeological studies have shown that the manufac- ture of pottery is often a 'symbolic process' which is loaded with meaning beyond the functional act of creating a fired clay container. 3 Similarly, the decoration of the pot is often not just a matter of applying design in the face of tradition. Thus Welbourn has shown how Kenyan Endo ceramics are seen in anthropomorphic terms, with different parts of the vessel and their associated decorations bringing to mind equivalent parts of the human body. Loaded with this potency, pots have a particular importance in ceremony, for their use '. . . enhances and reinforces the significance and importance of the ritual passage, especially when many of these objects have everyday uses. The ritual legitimisation of the social order is reflected and reinforced by the everyday legitimation of everyday use'. In addition, and significantly for the interpretation of archaeological residues, such associations may long outlive the prosaic function of the vessel, for Welbourn notes that broken sherds may be left around compounds for many years, implying a sense of permanence'. 38 In addition to design placement, the actual motifs employed may have a far greater significance than has yet been acknowledged. 'Early Iron Age' ceramics known from the first millennium south of the Limpopo River are conventionally divided into the Matola and Lydenburg Traditions 39 although both are characterised by sets of geometric designs in various combinations. So far these have only been used as 'cultural markers' in disputes about origins, directions of movement and associations40 and the fact that geometric design is a far wider phenomenon has not been deemed significant. But Tilley, in his study of the Middle Neolithic of Southern Sweden, has followed a thesis proposed by Gombrich and shown how the degree of 'boundedness' of designs which are, in some cases, very similar to those known from southern Africa, may indicate the nature of power relations between communities. " Thus there is a case for investigating ceramics as the vehicle for the signification of power relations between households in first millennium southern Africa. Indeed, any such role would be reinforced by the mundane function of ceramics for, in an economy dominated by cereal cultivation, pots would have been important in the 3 For a discussion of the concept of 'symbolic process', see R.

If this proposition is correct, then I would expect ceramics and their decoration to have a central role in what Giddens has termed the 'binding' of space and time; the manner in which time and space are themselves used as resources in the enactment of power relations between actors. 43 Indeed, the archaeological evidence from the first millennium is quite consistent with such a possibility. The 'span' of similarly decorated ceramics (from 50 B.C. to 900 A.D. and from the Mozambican coast to western Transkei) is quite incompatible with any 'ethnic' or 'tribal' model of shared social system and is rather consistent with a wide ranging network of shared obligations similar in form to the hxaro of the Kalahari. By exchanging cereal products in vessels similarly decorated with potent symbols, householders would simultaneously signify and reaffirm their mutual connectedness. The conser- vativeness of the decorative codes - an accumulation of 'symbolic capital' in Bourdieu's terms44 - reflects the high price of innovation; faced with the daily uncertainty of agriculture in the southern African savannas it was vitally important that reciprocal obligations should be constantly reinforced. Such a system of signification through ceramic design would be precisely analogous to, and to a large degree contemporary with, the system of signification through rock art. Such a binding of space clearly operates simultaneously as a binding of time, for by signifying an obligation, the actor is projecting reciprocity into the future; the 'delayed response' which is a crucial part of the relationship. 45 But, as Giddens has pointed out, there are different sorts of time, and the making of a key artefact like a pot has a role in more than one of them. Thus in dasein, the linear time of day-by-day living in which the individual perceives a progression from birth towards death, the routinisation of activities is essential to provide the individual with a sense of 'ontological security'; 46 the source of 'tradition' which has been obliquely perceived by archaeologists as determinate of conformity in ceramic form and style. But if ceramics also served to signify the rules of power relations between households, the pot would also have had roles in 'reversible', or cyclical, time; the longue duree of institutional repetition and the dure'e of the daily, seasonal and annual cycles. 47 Apart from the future projection of obligations repaid and incurred, the archaeological record has yielded the shadows of additional roles in the binding of duree and longue dure'e past and present. The seventh century ceramic heads from Lydenburg in the eastern Transvaal, with geometric decorations similar to those found on contemporary pottery and carefully placed on the human form, suggest strongly a role in 'making real' ritual as among the Endo. 48 Although the details of 42 C.

Of equal importance to securing the future is the validation of the past, for the consciousness of longue duree is based on the knowledge of reversible time completed. It is clear that, in recent non-literate societies in Africa and other parts of the world, oral traditions have had a central role in binding the past to the present and that signification of the connectedness of present and past is achieved through sets of ritual artefacts. 49 Although we have no knowledge of the rituals which bound first millennium households to their past, the role of ceramics in signifying such connections is apparent. 'Early Iron Age' pots have frequently been found buried in pits, often inverted and with their bases deliberately removed. 50 If these features are interpreted as part of the symbolic process binding together time, then the actions of burial and the double negation of the role of the vessel (inversion and removal of the base) must have had considerable potency. Thus the model of the relationships between these early households, although in places frankly speculative, holds together. Because only limited storage of resources was possible, there could be little accumulation of power, reinforcing the need for secure reciprocal relations between households to cope with the anticipated risks of duree. In consequence the widely accepted signification code of rock art and ceramic decoration was of crucial importance. The Lineage Mode of Production A second form of the articulation of forces and relations of production has been called the 'Lineage Mode of Production', and has been defined and employed within the southern African context by several historians. 5' As with many social formations dominated by the primitive communist mode of production, kinship provides the realisation of the relations of production in the lineage mode. In contrast with the primitive communist mode, however, it has been argued that dominance (control of surplus production) is not confined to relationships of prestation and redistribution within the domestic unit, but is rather at the scale of the lineage, and between dominant and dominated lineages. In this formulation, senior members of the exogamous lineages maintain their authority by controlling marriages - necessary if homestead heads are to obtain female labour to work in the fields and children for the continuity of their domestic units. By retaining a portion of the surplus product that circulates as a result of marriage arrangements and other forms of prestation and redistribution, lineage 4 For an example of a detailed analysis of the role of oral tradition as a 'political charter', see A.

In turn, members of the royal group organise crucial activities that demand coordination between lineages, for example large-scale hunting, harvesting and defence. It has been argued that, in general, neither lineage heads nor members of the royal lineages have access to sufficient coercion to maintain their control through force. Consequently, their sanctions are ideological, based on the lineage elders' (and at a higher level, the chief's) claim to close kinship connection with the ancestors, and belief in the power of the ancestors to intervene at critical junctures in the processes of everyday life. Therefore, by controlling ritual, the lineage leaders control the relations of production. 52 An objection to the concept of the Lineage Mode of Production has been the identity of the definitive collectivity. In the primitive communist mode the principle agent is seen as a minimal group. 5 This may be the 'camp', the 'domestic group' or the 'household', all of which concepts overlap in their definitions, but all of which contain the idea of a group of people involved in concrete action and interaction. 5" But in the lineage mode, emphasis is shifted to a collectivity that may have no such day-by-day existence: the lineage. Adam Kuper has traced the fortunes of the lineage through the history of anthropology and has shown that it has been an analytical category difficult to discover 'on the ground'. 'Two reasons above all support this conclusion. First, the model does not represent folk models which actors anywhere have of their own societies. Secondly, there do not appear to be any societies in which vital political and economic activities are organised by a repetitive series of descent groups. '55 Guyer has reached a similar conclusion as the result of a more empirical survey of the literature, arguing that descent ideology is more a problem to be investigated than the basis for an assumption and that those who use the concept of the lineage mode of production 'drop it onto vast areas of Africa like a cookie cutter onto the dough'. 56 Hammond-Tooke, who had earlier seen the segmentary lineage as the basis of organisation for the Cape Nguni, has recently revisited his analysis and found that he was mistaken. 5 However, these criticisms miss the point that a mode of production is a theoretical concept that will not fall because the folk category of the lineage cannot be found. The crucial feature of the lineage mode of production is the control of the relations of production from beyond the immediate unit of production. At worst, Guyer and Kuper's critiques indicate a terminological inadequacy and, for the present, the lineage mode remains a useful conceptualisation. 52 Hedges, 'Trade and politics'. 5 In Giddens' terms, the minimal group is defined as having a high 'presence-availability'.

As shown already, a persistent problem within the primitive communist mode would be securing the reciprocal relations essential if variations in the resource base were to be dealt with effectively. This problem was amplified greatly when agriculture was a component in the forces of production, for added to the environmental variability facing hunter-gatherers were the problems of potential crop failure and stock loss with higher densities of population. Such factors must have resulted in a contradiction between the need to establish relations of delayed reciprocity on the one hand, and the need to retain the surplus product, as an insurance against the failure of reciprocal arrangements, on the other. At the same time there was, in Slater's words, a 'dialect with nature'; an ongoing interchange which was constantly changing the concrete terms of this contradic- tion. 58 It is probable that, in the first millennium A.D., southern African farming communities were living in woodland environments; closed forests along the sub-tropical littoral and savannas with variable tree density on the rest of the coastal plain and in the river valleys and valley sides. 59 But the very process of agriculture, and particularly of swidden cultivation, must have resulted in a progressive opening of these woodlands and the creation of more extensive secondary grazing for livestock. This transformation of the environment may have been rapid in some areas and slow in others; indeed, in some circumstances fallow fields may have been allowed to regenerate completely, resulting in equilibrium between farmer and the biota. The important point is that the consequences of swidden cultivation provided a solution to the contradiction in the relations of production of the primitive communist mode. This solution was based on the greater surplus potential of domestic livestock over grain, for although seed crops of the latter could be stored and a certain amount of additional accumulation was possible, the southern African climate was not in general suited to keeping large stocks of grain over sustained periods. 60 In addition, grain production was labour intensive, while accumulated surplus would be subject to a range of risks including decay, damage by pests and loss in warfare. Livestock, on the other hand, could be moved with ease if circumstances so demanded while flocks and herds increased in size with the minimum of labour input and herders. Consequently, there would have been an imperative for households in social formations where the primitive communist mode was dominant to accumulate livestock while still maintaining reciprocity with other households. But such accu- mulated wealth gave those who had it the power to set up unequal exchanges, for by giving more than was received an obligation was established; a basis for power within the lineage and the dominance of one lineage over others. 58 Slater, 'Transitions in the political economy'. 5 M.

Sansom, 'Traditional economic systems' in W.D. Hammond-Tooke (ed.), The Bantu-speaking Peoples of Southern Africa (London, 1974).</page><page sequence="12">12 Journal of Southern African Studies Viewed from this perspective, the critical transition in the pre-colonial southern African past was not to acquisition of crop plants and domestic animals, or the change from mobility to sedentary village life, or the manufacture of iron tools, for these all represented changes in the forces of production within a mode where the relations of production remained essentially unchanged. Of definitive importance was the transfer of accumulated surplus production from the household to the larger collectivity, for this caused changes that ran through the whole fabric of society. If the general contention, made earlier, that power relations are signified in material culture holds good, then it is to be expected that a transition from primitive communist to lineage mode, with concomitant and definitive changes in relations of production, would be marked in the archaeological record. This appears to be the case. In particular, the wide-reaching networks of reciprocity that were so central to relations of production in the primitive communist mode would be subverted in the lineage mode, for they would work against the interests of those new power holders who had succeeded in accumulating wealth in cattle. Consequently, the long established ceramic signification of power relations within the primitive communist mode would also fall away. This is indeed apparent in the archaeological record for, in 600 A.D., when swidden clearance could not have had a profound impact, ceramic decorative motifs were common across a wide area, indicating the need for a generally acknowledged system of signification. But by 900 A.D. localised variants in ceramic decoration were apparent in areas such as the eastern Transvaal and the Tukela basin, 61 suggesting power accumulation and a need for distancing from the generalised system of signification to emphasise a new order of obligations. It is not surprising to find that such localised ceramic styles are accompanied by evidence for the greater importance of cattle. 62 This bridge between the 'Early Iron Age' and 'Late Iron Age' has been in part perceived by Huffman.63 However, the point is not that both shared a common, ahistorical 'cognitive system' based on cattle, but rather that the household in which power could be accumulated and stored had localised, multiple origins in the first millennium as householders found, and were able to apply, the accumulation of livestock as a solution to the tenuity of earlier relations of reciprocity. An associated prediction would be that societies structured by the lineage mode had new forms of signifying relations of production. It was argued earlier that one of the key validations of ceramics as a system of signification was the association of pots with the redistribution of grain as a principal resource. Consequently, it can be anticipated that livestock would be central in a new system of signification. Both ethnographic and archaeological evidence make it abundantly clear that this was the case. Adam Kuper has brought together a wide variety of sources to show 61 T.M. Evers, 'The Iron Age in eastern Transvaal, South Africa' in E.A.

Of central importance are bridewealth payments which, Kuper reminds us, must not be seen as a consequence of cattle-holding, but a system of transactions in which cattle are the signifier: 'Each bridewealth payment consequently formed part of a chain of transactions, not only between the immediate 'wife-givers' and 'wife-takers' (however they might be defined) but between debtors and creditors, related in a great many possible ways . . . The system . . . rested on a simple and ineluctable principle of reciprocity. Cattle were exchanged for wives, wives for cattle. This rule applied not only as between a man and his wife's family, but at every step between those who contributed to bridewealth payments, and those who exchanged bridewealth for wives.'64 Thus the marriage exchange is the pivotal transaction in a network of connections and obligations that weave together many households. In adopting codes of signification based on cattle, these later precolonial house- holds have in a sense removed themselves further from the archaeological gaze. Mere cattle numbers from archaeological sites are insignificant, and the meaning is not engraved on the potent object, as in rock art and ceramic decoration. Neverthe- less, there are clear indications that cattle had a role similar to that described by Kuper on the basis of the recent ethnography. The numerous stone-built settlements known from the southern highveld, the foothills of the Drakensberg, the uplands of Zululand and other areas south of the Limpopo River are centred on varied designs of livestock enclosure. But many of the architectural details cannot be explained in purely functional terms. Entrances may be complex and stylised, as at the site of Mgoduyanuka in Natal, 65 surrounding walls may be too low to have been of practical value, as at many of the Type N sites on the southern highveld66 while the complexes of secondary and primary enclosures in Zululand and on the southern highveld67 cannot merely be for the convenient division of the herd. It would seem probable that many of these architectural features, highly expensive in terms of the labour needed to construct the walling, were associated with the signification of cattle as the principal medium in storing and transmitting relations of power. Therefore the occupants of households with cattle 'bound' together locales in webs of 'unbalanced reciprocity'.68 But, as with the primitive communist mode, it was equally important to bind together dure'e and, here again, the central role of cattle is evident. The importance of cattle in mediating between present and past in sacrifices for the ancestors has been interpreted and reinterpreted since Herskovits formulated the idea of the 'cattle complex', is described in many standard ethnogra- phies, and does not need repetition here.69 Equally evident is the archaeological 64 A.

The Tributary Mode of Production A third structure which has been applied in the analysis of southern African pre-colonial history is the 'Tributary Mode of Production'. As with the primitive communist and lineage modes, the crucial area is the nature of the relations of production; the manner in which the surplus is distributed. In Slater's definition surplus is transferred by the producer to the elders as in the lineage mode (Meillass- oux's 'prestation') and then on to a dominant lineage, which can use accumulated wealth to retain military followers and expand its sphere of power further. In Slater's view, this coercive ability allowed the development of feudalism in southern Africa, with the direct producer forced to give a proportion of his time to meet the subsistence requirements of a 'non-labouring class', while still retaining a degree of control over the means of production. This economic power (of the non-labouring class) was not complete, because the subordinate class was not totally separated from control over the means of production. It was not concentrated in the hands of the monarch or a handful of individuals, but decentralised to varying degrees amongst a large number of powerholders. .. The powerholder at the apex was a "paramount" rather than a "king". His power was very far from being "absolute". 72 Wolf, however, has criticised this distinction of feudalism at the theoretical level, and suggests instead a continuum within the tributary mode, with an all-powerful ruling elite at one end of the spectrum and the decentralised power structure of feudalism at the other; 73 a model which avoids the particularism of Slater's interpre- tation of the Zulu Kingdom as a rapid progression through tributary, feudal and absolutist modes, and is certainly more useful when considering the full range of the southern African past. A feature central to the tributary mode of production is the state; the mechanism through which the dominant class ensures the continuing extraction of surplus labour from subservient classes. 74 Thus the tributary mode, the origin of the state and the presence of distinct classes within particular social formations are inextricably bound together. Bonner has considered the problem of the transition from the lineage to the tributary mode of production in eighteenth and nineteenth century south-east Africa, where the Zulu, Swazi and a number of other kingdoms came into being. He has suggested that trade with merchants at Delagoa Bay, coupled with a sharp fall in agricultural production consequent to a severe drought and famine in the early 70 Maggs, Iron Age Communities; E.

Unfortunately, the technological preoc- cupations of southern African archaeology have had the result that, although sites such as Great Zimbabwe have provided prima facie evidence for the existence of complex social formations for many years, there has been no systematic considera- tion of state formation in the subcontinent prior to the work of historians such as Slater and Bonner. In searching for evidence of early states in southern Africa, it is again important to remember that the relations of production, rather than any particular causal agent, are crucial. Therefore although trade between social formations may commonly be associated with the state, it cannot be seen as an immediately determinate factor, as Huffman has suggested in the context of the origins of the state based around Great Zimbabwe between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. 76 Equally religion and ritual may often be central to the manner in which a dominant class maintains power. A hallmark of these (ideological) models is that they not only underline the status of the surplus takers and the social distance separating them from other people, but they also claim supernatural origins and validation. The Chinese emperor was the holder of the mandate of Heaven, ensuring they balance of Heaven and Earth; the Confucian sash-bearing scholars activated that mandate by enacting the proper hierarchical relationships. The kraton, or palace, or the Southeast Asian ruler was more than the center of government; it was also the site of religious ritual carried on by the king-god and his noble entourage. . . 77 But again, this factor is a consequence of the state, rather than a cause as Garlake has suggested, again with regard to the Zimbabwe state. 78 Other evidence must be used to show when patterns of distribution were transformed from the interlineage scale to the supralineage scale. Here, Cohen's concept of fission is particularly useful. Cohen has argued that all political systems except true states break up into similar units as part of their normal process of political activity. Hunting bands, locally autonomous food producers, and chief- taincies each build up the polity to some critical point and then send off subordinate segments to found new units or split because of conflict over succession, land shortage, failure by one segment to support another in intergroup competition or hostilities, or for some other reason. These new units grow in their turn, then split again. The state is a system specifically designed to restrain such tendencies. And this capacity creates an entirely new society: one that can expand without splitting, incorporate other polities and ethnic groups, and become more populous, more heterogeneous, and more powerful, with no known upper limit on its size or strength. 7 7 Bonner, 'Dynamics'. 76 Huffman, 'Archaeology and ethnohistory'. 7 Wolf, Europe, p. 83. 78 P.S.

Service (eds.), Origins of the State: the Anthropo- logy of Political Evolution (Philadelphia,. 1978).</page><page sequence="16">16 Journal of Southern African Studies Fission is particularly useful as a dimension of state formation in the absence of documentary or oral evidence for the nature of the relations of production, for it may be directly reflected in the period over which a site is occupied and in the spatial distribution of settlements. When Cohen's notion of fission is combined with the suggestion that the presence of a state apparatus will be indicated archaeologically by the presence of a hierarchy of settlement types, 80 it is possible to reexamine the southern African archaeological record for evidence of contrasting relations of production. For example, Maggs' wide ranging analysis of farming settlement on the southern highveld between the fourteenth and nineteenth centuries8' shows that although some settlements within clusters of settlements were larger than others, there are no large local or regional centres and that, through the centuries, farming communities radiated outwards towards the west and south. This appears to be an excellent example of the dynamic of the lineage mode and Cohen's fission. In contrast, Denbow's work on the eastern margins of the Kalahari82 has revealed a social formation, dated to between about 700 A.D. and 1400 A.D., in which large numbers of cattle were kept in a threefold hierarchy of settlements, the largest of which were very much larger than the smallest. This settlement pattern, coupled with the evidence for the accumulation of surplus on a substantial scale, is clear evidence for the tributary mode of production, classes and some form of state apparatus. The model presented in this paper for the transition from primitive communist to lineage modes of production also suggests why and how the tributary mode emerged from the lineage mode. Again, the key is the accumulation of surplus and the nature of relations of production. While cattle remained the form in which surplus could be accumulated and redistributed, there would have been limits to the extent of economic differentiation. Natural increases in herd sizes, while allowing lineage elders to increase their holdings, would also provide outsiders with the opportunity to build surplus to their own account. In addition, the effective costs per unit of maintaining wealth in such a form would increase with increases in herd size, as grazing would have to be found at ever-increasing distances from settlements, with increasing risk of loss from raiding and other agencies. However, from about 800 A.D., new forms of signifying power became available with trade from the east coast to the Limpopo River valley and beyond. 83 Glass beads, cloth and other exotic items achieved value in their rarity and in the constraints on their supply, and by 1200 A.D. new political orders were established on the eastern margins of the Kalahari and in the Limpopo River valley. These may be distinguished by hierarchical patterns of settlement and centralised control of wealth. More work is necessary before it can be established how traded commodities achieved generally recognised status as wealth, but it is clear that, within a few 80 G.A.

Just as gold was an essential standard for European and Asian trade, so beads and cloth were accepted tokens of wealth in southern Africa. This mechanism allowed surplus accumulation on a far greater scale than had been possible with cattle alone, leading to class formation and the transition from the lineage to the tributary mode. 84 The point is not that trade 'caused' the emergence of early pre-colonial state, but rather that the availability of exotic trade goods allowed a contradiction within the lineage mode to be resolved, leading to a transition to a new mode. Conclusion Conceptualising the southern African past as a set of modes of production is clearly an advance over the migration model and the concept of two 'ages' explained in terms of simple technological development. Emphasis on the role of the relations of production redirects attention to the totality of human behaviour and avoids the reductionism inherent in both those approaches which have seen a determinate role in the environment and those which have given primacy to 'cognitive system'. In addition, materialist theory which stresses the importance of the relations of production points to the explanatory power of archaeological evidence, such as burial practice and architecture, which has sometimes been considered secondary to more ubiquitous data such as fauna, lithic and ceramic artefacts. It must be emphasised that the interpretation offered here is preliminary. In particular, the concept of a Primitive Communist Mode of Production, which began millennia ago, incorporated a modification in the forces of production with the availability of domestic crops and animals early in the first millennium A.D., and was finally replaced late in the first millennium when cattle accumulation solved central contradictions in the mode, demands further theoretical refinement and testing. Similarly, early state formation, accompanying the transition from lineage mode to tributary mode, is exciting terrain for future research. The main point, however, is not that the formulation put forward in this paper is necessarily correct, but that archaeological evidence can be used to address the problem. Despite more than thirty years of empiricism, southern African archaeology is not doomed to be the mere classification of stone tools and potsherds. 8 Hall, Changing Past.</page></plain_text>
