<plain_text><page sequence="1">never separated in his mind. His research on in- dividual works of art, be it the cathedral of Chartres or Centula, or the work of an individual artist, such as a painter of stained glass win- dows, speaks for itself. Only on this basis could he present in his volume of the Handbuch an over-all picture of early Mediaeval and Roman- esque architecture which, to this day, remains astonishing both in its breadth and its depth. And it is good to know that the volume on Gothic architecture which he prepared for the Pelican History of Art just was terminated in manuscript by the time of his death. Paul Frankl's strength was that he always came back to the individual work of art as a source of his thought. Only those who were fortunate enough to stand with him in front of a building, to crawl with him through every nook and corner, climb across the vaults and down into the foundations can understand how su- perbly he "read" a building and the successive phases of its construction and how he enjoyed finding out about the architect's or architects' intentions and their changes of plan. Only those who studied under him can know how he taught them to read a structure, to observe every minute detail, never to jump to conclusions, and thus to reconstruct the history of the individual work and through it, the gross, the fulfillment and the change of style in a given period. Paul Frankl had the secret of the great teacher. He showed you the tools and taught you their use. He presented you with his view of a prob- lem and with his interpretation of historical data and their interrelation, but he never tried to force his views on his students. If we disagreed with him, he would listen, and without giving an inch, think over our arguments. He had the deep respect the true scholar and teacher has for the greenest of his students, who is himself a potential scholar. His own firm convictions made him respect those of others, even when he could not share them. The combination of conviction and respect was perhaps the greatest thing he transmitted to us.
