The Fortunes of Nigel. I. PROEM CANADA is the Scotland of America, and a proof is before you. Scotland gave a King to England in 1603; today Canada gives a President to the American; Statistical Association. James Sixth of Scotland and First of England whose vasty shoes I thus inherit is, I fear, "mixed grill" to many. He was an apriorist, and he was a pedant. Though his education was bleak and early as Stuart Mill's, he hadn't a good style. His personal appearance was against him, also his northern accent, even his table manners (he drank his cocky-leekie from the bowl). He was given to cursing and swearing. It is a chilling historicism. Yet, despite that Professor Laski still uses him austerely in the Encyclo- paedia of the Social Sciences, from a boy with the Fortunes of Nigel in my school-desk I have liked its "principal personage" (as Scott called him) James. And of course he is the James of Jamestown, first per- manent English settlement, first cradle of representative government, in these United States. Speaking of Nigel, even in the 'nineties we used to skip the antique, Dr. Dryasdust "Introduction." Yet there amidst a descant on dying chivalry stands out a sentence how that when Nigel went up to London "already the hour was arrived when Bacon was to teach the world no longer to reason from authority to fact, but to establish truth from fact *EDITORIAL NOTE: This paper was read by Dr. Coats as his presidential address at the one hundredth annual meeting of the American Statistical Association, December, 1938, and is reprinted by permission from the Journal of the American Statistical As- sociation, March, 1939.

It appears my cue. And James who was a theologian in the seventeenth century would, they say, have been a philosopher in the eighteenth, a man of science (of Tennyson's water no doubt) in the nineteenth, and I like to hope a statistical "fan" (useful word) today. He "enlarged" and protected, though he did not comprehend, the inductive Bacon; if Bacon fell it was because of his deductions (the pun, alas, is pure James). My title is "Science and Society," one must be in the fashion. Incontinently I call the Social Sciences "Science," though the "exact" sciences have been stretching a hand of late upon us. Overseas, Lancelot Hogben, Julian Huxley, J. B. S. Haldane, are indeed "the cat amongst the pigeons."1 Here, judging by our A.A.A.S., they would not "take over," but they do insist on "social" status. Perhaps they have been reading Walter Lippmann who judges with President Butler that joint- stockism, a purely social device, did as much as invention to increase production in the nineteenth century,2 at any rate it can buy up the patents. And History is aware of inventions before 1800, vixere fortes ante Agamemnona.3 And the anthropologists (statisticians now, by whose measurements the Indian, the Negro, and the Eskimo are the "highbrows" of the continent)4 would say that it was the stirrup that made Attila a nuisance long before poison gas and the fire bomb, our own fine flowers.5 But in truth there is nothing in history like the problem of today. Moreover, it grows. Chemistry alone with its catalyst and now its valence with quantum theory taking on the energy problem '"The association of economics with science jars harshly on the modern ear" (Lance- lot Hogben, Prolegomena to Political Arithmetic, Toronto, 1938). 2Walter Lippmann, The Good Society (Boston, 1937), pp. 13-17. 3"Spice high with Latin and a curn or two of Greek," one was admonished when conversing with James; of Hebrew he was less exigent. The Marquis of Worcester's list of one hundred new inventions (all his own) appeared in 1663; Hero of Alexandria's about 75 A.D.,-from a fire engine to a penny-in-the-slot machine. 4And you are not weak because your chin recedes or brave because your jaw sticks out (A. Hrdlicka, "The Forehead" in Smithsonian Institute, Annual Report, 1933, Washington, 1935, pp. 407-14). Karl Pearson's controversy with the craniologists may be recalled ("The law of ancestral heredity," Biometrika, Feb., 1903). Statistics is giving meaning to the new science of biotypology. 5The stirrup enabled cavalry to thrust as well as deliver chopping blows. But the fire-bomb has the "edge," especially on non-combatants, as Bruno Mussolini's Volli Sulle Ambe (recommended to Italian schools) elucidates: "I got only mediocre effects because I was expecting enormous explosions whereas the little Abyssinian homes give no satisfaction to anyone bombing them. The incendiary bombs give satisfaction, at any rate one sees the fire. We set fire to the wooded hills and the little villages; it was all most diverting; I began throwing bombs by hand. It was most amusing. A big 'zariba' was not easy to hit, I had to aim carefully. The wretches inside, seeing their roof burning, jumped out and ran like mad."</page><page sequence="3">Science and Society -the sun-and-earth machine, the geo-electric engine, a utilizable sub- atomic potential-perhaps! As to our biological future, it isn't decent; its Brave New World makes Dean Inge sick in the English use. Astronomy and four-dimensional physics meanwhile poise us between oo and 6x (1027 atoms =1 man; 1028 men =1 star) in mere awe; and mass is energy and energy is mass, and so on: This is a snow flake that was once a flame. We are like Alice when she nibbled the mushroom and her chin got tangled with her toes. Not that the social sciences could advance till physics and chemistry had defined the environment, and biology and psychology had told us what we are-statistics were not very necessary before 1700. But now, as I say, the cry is for help, the need is dire. Man must not wear his science like the shirt of Nessus.6 But in the vernacular, is he who heaves the brick the one to assess the damage, noble as it is to offer? And is the "balm" to be the "Cartesian Economics" of the Chemist?-or the Technocracy or the Social Credit of the Engineers? Ah no, the tail must not wag the dog, even "a ninety-six inch tail on a four-inch dog." In the new Salvation Army the social sciences must take over and direct the natural sciences, not vice versa- of course, like General Booth, not letting the devil monopolize the good tunes. This is all the natural sciences want-to tell us how. My point is that, so far, they lack definiteness in the telling. And here without further "build-up" my title regresses to "Statistics and Science," not that the change is so great. In close upon the 100th year of our Associa- tion and of the Physique sociale and of Cournot's Recherches; about the 200th of the Treatise of Human Nature; one is 'almost compelled to the pleasant theme. James himself could have wished no wider for his discursive tongue. One other apologetic: A preacher (Scottish) once explained that when he said religion he meant the Protestant religion, and by the Protestant religion the Presbyterian religion, and by Presbyterianism the Wee Free Kirk. So I in like-felt crescendo address you only as a statistical administrator, but that of a central Statistical Bureau, a ministry as it were of all the talents. James, who wrote thirty books on forty subjects (from predestination to tobacco), was an administrator when Kings were Kings; an office like mine which has many times James's output (and on more subjects), is of a day when Statisticians 60r, as W. F. Ogburn would say less tragically, the tin can, marvel though it be, must not be tied to Society, even in the form of women's suffrage. "The invention of the tin can led to canning factories; it reduced the time in preparing meals; it thus gave women more time for activities outside the home" (W. F. Ogburn, "The Influence of Invention and Discovery" in Recent Social Trends, New York, vol. I, chap. iii). 153</page><page sequence="4">154 The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science are fast becoming Statisticians. If therefore I speak in all the bravura of the Basilikon Doron, you will understand. II. STATISTICS AND "SCIENCE" Beginning softly, statistics has long been handmaid to these exact sciences, apprenticed in the scullery, but now risen housekeeper, eating with the family. Statistical averages and distributions now supplement the old inductive processes everywhere, i.e., the observing of experi- mentation has become scientific. This opens a dozen vistas. Passing astronomy the pioneer (our motion through space only an index number); passing biology the pre-eminent (species only a statistical grouping); let us glance down just the two most distractingly intimate to homo sapiens,-the two he places first in the prayer book, preceding economics: medicine and psychology.7 Medicine.-Medicine, a fragment of Greek science, all but perished when slave labour divorced the manual from the mental, leaving diet to nurses, materia medica to monks and apothecaries, surgery to barbers. The Renaissance set that straight,8 and Vital Statistics for a hundred years has been signalling just where to train the guns-a reconnaissance on foot at first, now the scouting airplane. Dublin and Lotka think modern medicine will add, say, another ten years to life.9 But though this still leaves Back to Methuselah to biology and Bernard Shaw, did you notice the fuss over the new fertility questions in England lately, and the indignation of Mr. A. P. Herbert, MI.P., that women should be thought of like "cattle"? Mr. Herbert is a humourist (at any rate he is an editor of Punch) and still looks for children under gooseberry bushes, or for embryology in Ecclesiastes (xi, 5).10 But the doctor of 1938 is being taught more than birth, death, and morbidity reports, or how in the laboratory to correlate the elusive bacteriophage,-he is being taught how to capitalize his experience. Startling is Mr. Bradford Hill's hint of what may happen from an unscientifically analysed hospital record, and how easily a doctor may fool himself (and you and me) on what are quaintly called his "survival after treatment" rates." One 7"All those who are any ways afflicted or distressed in mind, body or estate." 8For a striking image see Graham Wallas, Social Judgment (London, 1934), p. 122. 9L. I. Dublin and A. J.

Census). "A.

Preventive medicine will soon include preventive statistics, and doctors will apply therapy in the light of o- and %2. Psychology.-Bound though it remain to the old Cartesian duality, the psychology that has shaken our time is objective. Energies, instincts, libidos, complexes, mostly of that new induction, the unconscious mind, are the interest; urgency the yardstick; "measure and move forward" the slogan. Quantitative goes hand in hand with qualitative even in accounting for cognition.l3 "The problem of judgment" (the harmony of reason and emotion), says Graham Wallas, "is quantitative." The intelligence test (G, with growing additions) bogged down till statistics replaced diagnostic (incidentally making hard going for the felicific calculus?).14 Galton's correlational coefficients theorem has expanded into the multiple factor analysis of temperamental and character traits, for better "captaincy of the soul." (Psychoanalysis might have, made a man of James.) And finally there are the para-psychologists. We have all been playing Professor Rhine's new card game-the extra- sensory perception (telepathy, clairvoyance) game.15 It appears that Professor Coover, endowed to assess Psychical Research and assessing it nil, slipped up in his statistics. The Duke experiments took off by creating the phenomena, thence statistically. Sad to say they grow less exciting. But will this new sheep ever win to the psychological fold? Did the Woman of Endor really raise Samuel? or have she and Saul and later compeers of the Poltergeist been merely raising Cain? Statistics is having a lot to say about it-from the stage, not the coulisses. 12R. H. Jones, "Physical indices and clinical assessments of the nutrition of school children" (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, vol. CI, part I, 1938). 13C. Spearman, Psychology down the Ages (Toronto, 1937), part E, wherein certain mental unities are derived by a statistical technique from (a) three knowledge-originating principles of a qualitative kind, stated as tendential, and (b) five quantitative principles, which determine their occurrence and amount. Contrast C. E.M. Joad's "psychology only becomes scientific at the cost of turning into physiology.... Psycho-analysis substitutes the stirring of the bowels for the process of reason" (Return to Philosophy, London, 1935). '4As a measure of the importance of the statistical use of applied psychology, R. B. Cattell finds that "the birthrate is inversely related to the intelligence level, throughout the whole of intelligence." If matters continue as at present "in 300 years half the popula- tion [of England] will be mentally defective" (The Fight for our National Intelligence, London, 1937). In Sweden, however, the outlook is not so bad (K. A. Edin and E. P. Hutchinson, Studies of Differential Fertility in Sweden, London, 1935). 15J. B.

Thus entropy, the alpha and omega, whereby the cosmos will surely one day reach thermodynamical equilibrium, and the present once and for all catch up with the future, and the forecaster cease from troubling (in a Nirvana of commingled history and geography)'7-entropy is just "proportional to the logarithm of the probability of the universe."'8 That may not matter for those of us who have things to do first (we have a thousand billion years to go), and in the space-time continuum Since there's no help, come, let us kiss and part will tell the hysterica passio of lovers for that long, but statistics sets the ineluctable end. And, again, since Heisenberg, there is no cast-iron determinism in physics (there never was, says Dingle) only statistical laws; the electron is just "a smear of probability"-a holistic Arminian as it were; and the quantum physicists' art is the art of the bookmaker. We cannot define and confine the human unit? Neither summarily can the physicist the electron, which is both velocity and position-a series of discrete happenings (teleologically or causally inspired let them fight it out) impossible even to imagine connectedly. Matter is but a mathe- matic of events: where numbers are large chance is the warranty. Physics and biology are not "simpler" than sociology, they are only "bigger," i.e., have larger aggregates to work on. Thus speaketh a new Zarathustra.l9 III. ARISTOTLE AND GALILEO IN PRACTICAL POLITICS And now, Mr. Chairman, I approach the Social Sciences, where, if this were an epic, I should make ad hoc invocation of the Muse (Urania in our case as in Milton's) "to the light of this great argument," while it pursues not only la statistique but les statistiques, a Brahma indeed. Statistics are primarily for "executive" use, to do things with- 16Sir Arthur Eddington, The Nature of the Physical World (Cambridge University Press, 1928), chap. xiv. 71In the meantime, however, the future here is as "existent" as the past, though there is no "now" in space. 1S"A definition which no statesman would be unwilling to admit to lie completely outside his purview" (G. Udny Yule, An Introduction to the Theory of Statistics, London, rev., 1936). l9But see W. H. Watson, On Understanding Physics (Toronto, 1938), particularly chap. iii; also Erwin Schr6dinger, Science and the Human Temperament (London, 1935).</page><page sequence="7">Science and Society which weds us at a word to "applied science." But frankly I was also brought up Consule Planco to think that statistics were parade-ground for theory, that statistics and theory were like Huz and Buz of whom Genesis (xxii,21) makes the cheery remark that Huz was the brother of Buz, and leaves it at that. But notoriously no poor relation expects to be made much of. And greatly though we be risen in the world today, let us beware of nouveau riche pretentions. Still let me bandy words for just one moment, at safe distance-James had "a genius for raising dangerous questions and settling none." Professor Hayek comes close to the cut direct. Man, to Professor Hayek, hangs midway between nature and society, the effect of one, the cause of the other. In nature the essential facts can only be surmised, but in society they are part of the stuff of our thinking, "known beyond the possibility of dispute." In the Natural Sciences, therefore, the empirical lies in the elements, whereas in the social sciences it is in the inductive process. Statistics cannot verify; they can, however, pose new problems. Naturally, in the Hayek epistemology (not to say solipsism) statistical technique sings low. Even so might Walter Lipp- mann, nonplussed as to what he would like for breakfast, reflect how many million times harder it would be to order breakfast for the United States.20 And Lionel Robbins has a fling at quantitative economics for never having discovered a law (Bonar advises "law" in quotation marks). But if it was economic legalisms that ruined Spain, lost the thirteen colonies, retarded factory legislation, and set up a wages fund (resembling Providence at least in being consistently on the side of the big battalions), Robbins himself would call it a day with us when fact leads on to larger fact, as for example when Kuznets on capital formation improves on previous analysis.21 So Cassel in the midst of his Quantitative Thinking, when he falls upon Professor Douglas's demonstration of the classic method of (1) the hypothesis; (2) the equation; (3) the verification by statistics (unfortunately Douglas failed to verify the famous three per 20F. A. von Hayek, Collectivist Economic Planning (London, 1935); "Economics and Knowledge" (Economica, Feb., 1937); E. C. Snow, "Is the Trade Cycle a Myth?" (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, vol. CI, part II, 1938). Lippmann's The Good Society consistently understates quantitative possibilities. Incidentally H. J. Fleur ("Racial Evolution and Archaeology," Huxley Memorial Lecture, delivered before Royal Anthropological Institute, Nov. 9, 1937) says Society is the Creator of Man, not vice versa. 21Lionel Robbins, Nature and Significance of Economic Science (London, rev., 1935); James Bonar, Philosophy and Political Economy (London, 1927); Graham Wallas, Social Judgment, pp. 120-7; Simon Kuznets, National Income and Capital Formation, I919-I935 (Toronto, 1937). 157</page><page sequence="8">158 The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science cent); would still agree with the much-quoted "mathematics is a subject where we do not know what we are talking about or whether what we are saying is true" of Bertrand Russell.22 Of course statistics is accus- tomed to gloatings over her frailties; some even transfer their own "illusions" to her, as if the moon were to blame when Burns saw too many horns.23 Now Burns poses the problem. Surely our bane is that the things "known beyond the possibility of dispute" have a way of turning out not so. Looking at the moon, Burns counted. He counted wrong, as a statistician in Burns's condition will, but his method was right. It may be only a trick of the brain that the one thing it can grasp comfortably is quantity, that until we measure a phenomenon we do not know it, but it is the trick that has given us Science, or the mathematical de- scription of things, based of course on the faith that things yield to such description. Yet for thousands of years "men thought it foolish to use their eyes on what their minds told them so clearly," and Aristotle (in the old story) promulgated that heavy objects fall faster than light, till Galileo dropped a mixed lot off the Pisa tower-and they went down aequo pede.24 The matter, however, is different when Burns (even 22Bertrand Russell, Mysticism and Logic (London, 1919). Paul H. Douglas, "Pro- fessor Cassel on the Statistical Determination of Marginal Productivity" (C.J.E.P.S., Feb., 1938). Theories, says W. H. Watson (On Understanding Physics) "must in the first place do what a crude map does for a surveyor . . . the equation is the perfectly clear as opposed to the muddled statement . . . but a clear statement may still be incorrect." The year's monumental essay in verification is the lamented Henry Schultz's Theory and Measurement of Demand (Chicago, 1938). 23Professor Knight, e.g., is scandalized at discrepancies of 40 per cent in cotton estimates, but not at theories which are diametrically or 100 per cent opposed to each other ("The Limitations of Scientific Methods in Economics" in The Trend of Economics ed. by R. G. Tugwell, New York, 1924). The particular Burns incident is in Death and Doctor Hornbook: "The rising moon began to glow'r The distant Cunnock hills out-owre: To count her horns, wi' a' my pow'r, I set mysel; But whether she had three or four, I cou'd na tell." 24Aristotle similarly said that air had no weight, and man went seventeen centuries without the common pump. Aristotle made few observations himself, and had a very limited range of facts from which to generalize. "His was a philosophical age. But he clearly understood the objectives of scientific method and research. His followers listen to him saying 'Let us first understand the facts and then we may seek 'their causes.' Again, 'We must not accept a general principle from logic only, but must prove its application to each fact, for it is in facts that we must seek general principles, and these must always accord with the facts' " (R. E. Chaddock, Review of Scientific Method by T. L. Kelly in American Statistical Journal, June, 1930). The elimination of the observer</page><page sequence="9">Science and Society a sober Burns) is looking not at the moon (perceptually) but at his fellow men and himself (conceptually)-for a new subjective emerges, and the social sciences are enmeshed. Well, but society is not an in- dividual but millions of individuals, and millions do "stay put." Analogy may mean much or nothing, as Mill says, and it may be little practical that the sciences are steadily converging upon one another and tauto- logically upon the flower in the crannied wall, but the new physics is more than titillating. The physicists seem, if from another planet one may say it, like M. Jourdain when he discovered that he had been talking prose all his life: they have discovered that the physical universe is not "hard" but "fuzzy"-like the social universe.25 But if this gives a new status to probability, it must not and does not abate the extreme of deterministic care over the observed foundations. In the war that comes down every wind between the "Aristotelians" (misnomer rather hard on Aristotle) and the "Galileans" over the "cosmolatries" of Milne, Eddington, and the rest-an aftermath of relativity-the Aristotelians would shift from prose to poetry, from physics to metaphysics, where we may all land at last if we are interested in what things are rather than in what things do. (Back to Hume, who abolished causation! back to Berkeley, who abolished matter!)26 But statistics has the best of both these worlds, its detail (les statistiques) the very stuff of Empiric, its mass (la statistique) the dread kismet of Law. Of course the nearest analogue to economics in Science, since Marshall will have it so, is biology. Marshall rather fobbed off Mendel, and one wonders what he is only technique. Quantity is defined by W. R. Thompson (no enemy of philosophy) as "that property by which not only the substance but all the qualitative attributes of the substance are made manifest to the senses" (Science and Common Sense, London, 1937). 25"In the live branches of physics formal logic is not called for; what is needed is a very different kind of thinking, a review of a system of interrelated facts and a perception of conjectured analogies" (C. G. Darwin, Logic and Probability in Physics, Presidential Address, Section A, B.A.A.S., 1938). 26Milne "by metaphysics out of mathematics" can breed universes at will, whilst Eddington is equally fertile with our'own. Over against, Dingle cares no more for Milne's universes than for Alice's; Jeans's mysterious universe, says Dingle, isn't mysterious: Jeans and Eddington but emotionalize the new mathematics from a tool and fifth sense into a science self-contained. Eddington, however, can derive N, which now replaces infinity as the number of particles in the universe, by sheer knowledge of relativistic quantum analysis: by looking at the articles in a house, says Eddington, we reach the generalization that none cost more than sixpence, but we can reach it equally well by knowing that they were bought at Woolworth's (Nature, May 8 and July 12, 1937, for the apotheosis of the Dingle-Eddington controversy). The Aristoteli- ans are attracting endowments, which is bitter. On probability as having an inde- pendent metaphysical existence see review of Von Mises' Wahrscheinlichkeit, Statistik und Wahrheit in Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, vol. CII, part I. 159</page><page sequence="10">160 The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science would say of Needham's statistical biology and the new continuity of inorganic, biological, and social order.27 There has always been over- lapping too in the old opposition of experiment and observation as method. Astronomy and meteorology among the natural sciences do without experiment: we can predict eclipses, but weather not well, so we call Nikias a fool, but still pray for rain. But how dangerous to say any longer that the social sciences cannot experiment: not only that but the experimentee can talk back while the experiment is on- what no cell or atom can do. In the threnody of C. F. Roos for the N.R.A., the saddest note is over the current statistical controls that might have been.28 To return to qualitative personalities: "Cloistered," "physiology not pathology," "too easy" as a brain exerciser, "unromantic," are words in Pigou's "apologia" for economics (Pantaleoni's "an idle science though a true one"-almost James Mill's "contemplative pleasure").29 Yet, though he would not "trespass" on ends ("what drugs will do, not what drugs to take"), he believes there should be "economic practition- ers," to tackle "immediate practical problems."30 Keynes thinks eco- nomists should go on government committees. So say all of us, if they will bear yet another Pigou injunction in mind: "to clothe the dry bones of theory with appropriate statistics" (there being an appropriate boneyard no doubt when the clothes will not go on). And I make bold to believe that a poll of "economic practitioners" will find four out of five practising just this device-statistics. On which I make the observation that ordinary training in economics is not training for research: it sounds incredible, but there are exhibits from time to time by economists, welcomed "with whoops" as Mr. Mencken would say by others, which are just bad statistical work-at least I know it may be so in Denmark. Bien entendu economists should not be adding to 27"The biology of tomorrow will be statistical.... One solitary isolated phenomenon is of no more interest to the biologist than the man in the moon ... it is not until we begin to deal with whole populations of facts that regularities begin to appear" (J. H. Needham in Science Today and Tomorrow, compiled from a series of lectures delivered at Morley College, London, 1937). And again: "Living things differ from dead things in degree and not in kind, and are as it were extrapolations from the inorganic" (J. H. Needham, The Sceptical Biologist, New York, 1930). Cf. also J. Langdon-Davies, Science and Common Sense (London, 1931), chap. vii. Most daring as analogy is Reiser's suggestion from relativistic kinematics that the structure of thought may be inferred from the structure of light, based on the Morley-Michelson isotrophy of light (on which, however, see W. R. Thompson's Science and Common Sense, chap. vi). 28C. F. Roos, NRA Economic Planning (Bloomington, Ind., 1937). 29A. C.

Of course we should like to be as Huz and Buz with theory, and impossible as it sounds in these days of specialization I believe most government statisticians could declare of theory as Josiah Allen of Paradise Lost that if they have not read it all they have "hefted" it. Part of the reward (one has to say it) is the dazzling controversy, some- times all along the line-foot, horse, and artillery-as with Barbara Wootton last summer. But unless called to give evidence, the statistician can but murmur to this, either "how can Satan cast out Satan," or con- temporaneously with Bertrand Russell "thought alone cannot establish any non-verbal fact." If a law is general enough it cannot help being right, but of what use is it to governments who cannot summon help from ceteris paribus or wait upon the "long run," for the ceteri are human beings all with votes-it is majorities not modals that matter. By a categorical imperative government economics is empirical. All of which leads to the one point in this paper, adumbrated when I said that the scientists in springing to the help of the economists are not practically minded. Notwithstanding the advances of past decades, notwithstanding that we have certain materials to suffocation, the problem remains the how of things, as when Newton never made a theory till the facts required it (non hypotheses fingo). Pigou is right: economics is not so hard, if only we could know what we are talking about. I shall expand on the latter in a moment. But first may I exemplify? I choose two subjects, unemployment and population, for their topicality, and I use Canadian statistics, not I hope another of the bores whose geese are swans, but simply as proffering chips from the workshop I know. IV. EMPIRICIST AT LARGE Unemployment.-To the orthodox, unemployment is "disequilibri- um." It wouldn't happen in a free market, except transitionally. When 31J. B.

Relief is another rigidity. Per contra, Mr. Keynes tracks unemployment past cyclical maladjustment to its lair in unemployed resources, unwillingly unemployed because savings are not flowing into investment. For cure,-reduce the rate of interest, which is not the reward of abstinence but a premium on not-hoarding swayed by liquidity preference, savings being a by-product of the level of income. Orthodoxy invokes scarce means; M/r. Keynes would prime the pump, after the philosophy of Mir. Alfred Doolittle,33-if you will pardon this unseemly brevity in so many-volumed a matter. No doubt more and better "barometrics" would help in this, dimin- ishing too that strain upon intuitive banking of which President Burgess spoke with pathos a year ago, that trouble in distinguishing cheap from easy money, new capital equipment from replacements-in generally maintaining the "feel" of things.34 What finally is this cycle, not always of contrasting but often of similar interrelations of factors on the way up and on the way down; whose path is more the strayed reveller's than the pendulum's;35 which shows signs of stepping out of the picture altogether-Stamp indeed says it will vanish once we define it, like a 33Keynes makes the assumption that the more income people receive, the larger proportion they save, whereas the classical economists assume that savings will be much less flexible, as human wants are unlimited. Both of these statements, of opposite bear- ing on policy, are without verification, though a family budget study over the gamut of incomes would clarify the point. Miss E. W. Gilboy, "Propensity to Consume" (Quarterly Journal of Economics, Nov., 1938) seems to say that for large classes of the population Keynes's postulates are not so. 34"Business forecasting," it has been said, "must be by observation not by theory, and in observation we must not be hypnotized by our tools, but must get the feel of the phenomena themselves. The business trend is full of all sorts of whirls and eddies that change as the stream strikes new channels, often working in diverse directions." 3aFrank D.

According to one school of thought we are now experiencing a major intermediate recession in a major cyclical recovery, but this view is opposed by those who argue that it is a minor intermediate recession in a major cyclical recovery. More pessimistic are the people who dispute whether it is a major or a minor intermediate recession in a minor cyclical recovery, and those who plump for a minor intermediate recession in a minor cyclical depression are outbid by those who insist that it is a major intermediate recession in a minor cyclical depression. The realists ask us to face the fact that it is a minor intermediate recession in a major cyclical depression and the Cassandras go all out for a major inter- mediate recession in a major cyclical depression.

The League of Nations is promising a world look-out, statistical one hopes, and has already got from Professor Haberler a synthetic framework of theory.36 But tonight I approach from the other end, that of the unemployed them- selves, who though ignorant of seismology know how the earthquake hit them. I invoke, as before said, the Canadian scene.37 We overturned a government in Canada in 1930 and held a special session of our Parliament; enacted then and thereafter a long series of relief measures; turned out another government; and finally set up an Employment Commission; in all of which Unemployment was Public Enemy No. 1. It still surprises some that in our 1931 Census we found nearly as much wage-earning employment in Canada, per capita of population, as in 1921 when we had no such disturbance. There was vastly more unemployment among persons working for wages, but why? Because there were proportionally more wage-earners. Because in the interval, while population increased only 18 per cent, and the total gainfully occupied only 20 per cent, the number of wage-earners increased 30 per cent. Under "prosperity" the wage-earners curve had siphoned a great "hump" out of the curve of workers-on-own-account. When the boom broke this was projected as unemployment: the boom-made jobs were gone, the individual had cut the painter with his old status.38 A second element can be isolated quite handily: Industry as it becomes mechanized, rationalized, integrated, centralized, increasingly constricts its labour supply; the rejects tend to become casual. This is secular, not cyclical, i.e., it is not a durable vs. consumption goods phenomenon. Moreover, unemployment is not a matter of all or the majority of workers being sometimes employed and sometimes idle, but of a differentiation (which is hardening) into two classes, the one seldom employed, the other seldom unemployed.39 The unemployed thus appear, first a sort of human scaffolding cast aside when the building stage of enterprise is over; secondly, a series of discards made as operating requirements are worked out. 36G. von Haberler, Prosperity and Depression (League of Nations, 1937). Of course it does not satisfy all economists: e.g., R. F. Kahn, "The League of Nations Enquiry into the Trade Cycle" (Economic Journal, Dec., 1937). 37Seventh Census of Canada, vol. VII; also Census Monograph on Unemployment. 38The Canadian Census, it will be noted, breaks up the total "gainfully occupied" population into (a) "wage-earners," and (b) "workers on own account." 39The differentiation varies with industry; it is much greater in an industry in which a small proportion lose time than in one in which a high proportion report some loss of time-the degree of difference appears to be a function of time lost, a fact of direct bearing on relief policy. 163</page><page sequence="14">164 The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science Some 1931 and 1936 figures are interesting. In 1936 certain industries showed an increase in numbers at work, whilst others showed a decrease, the increases aggregating 31,000, the decreases 24,000. You would expect less unemployment in the first category, but there was not, the reason being that, though the number at work increased, the total number of wage-earners increased pari passu. Meanwhile the industries that had 24,000 fewer jobs had actually fewer unemployed, because 30,000 workers got out of them, and this was not to any great extent a transfer to the increasing industries.40 How important is the dis- tribution factor is seen, of course, if we project the 1921-31 trend: it would require, by 1941, an increase of 26 per cent in volume to maintain even the 1931 proportion of continuously employed, yet at that the number losing time would be swelled by 50 per cent. What of wages and earnings? It is the low-wage class that shows heaviest unemployment. Indeed, it would seem that the higher the wages the steadier the employment. Less than a half of our wage- earners receive perhaps 80 per cent of the wages bill; had all our un- employed worked full time in 1931 it would have added less than 15 per cent to that bill. Could they have been put to work by wage-reductions in the higher brackets? Well, if we cut the wages of, say, statisticians (which Heaven forfend), we might theoretically hire more and increase output, but we could not hire from amongst the unemployed because there are no unemployed statisticians in Canada, and no statisticians employed at other than statistical jobs. Alas, there are too few altogether. Race and sex have little bearing. There is unemployment amongst the races attracted by the boom conditions, but that is not "race." Female workers fare as badly as the males ceteris paribus, except as regards long-time unemployment: as a class they are in occupations less exposed to unemployment. As to age, the old and the young are not more apt to lose their jobs, as is commonly said, but it is harder for them to obtain new ones.41 Seasonality is not the bugbear it is painted. 40The 1936 Census from which these figures are taken covered only the three Prairie Provinces. The complete figures are as follows: While the total number of "gainfully occupied" increased from 895,786 in 1931 to 915,436 in 1936, or by 19,650, the number of "workers on own account" increased by 32,891, so that the number of "wage-earners" decreased by 13,241. Meanwhile the number of unemployed wage-earners decreased by 18,739. 41A propos, W. H. Beveridge commenting on the common view that men become too old at 55 or 60 years to be retained in employment, points out that old union records run directly counter to this view. "In them at least men seem able to work on to a later age than they could a generation ago." Commenting, however, on the special Report on Unemployment by the United Kingdom Ministry of Labour in 1927, he arrives at the same conclusion as above.</page><page sequence="15">Science and Society I review these facts because it has been said that "quantities of employment can be made strictly homogeneous" (Keynes fabricates a "labour unit" playmate to the "economic man"); and again that high prices of raw materials counteract high industrial wages as labour magnets during a boom. Distance no doubt lends homogeneity to the view, but those who must provide relief, preserve occupational skill, and maintain morale in a country, cannot use the big end of the tele- scope. There is all the difference in the world between the entire working force losing a couple of weeks a year, and 5 per cent of it losing the whole year. Yet in many an aperqu this disappears, as from an airplane disappear those earth-wrinkles so distressful to road builders, excellently as earth-sphericity is revealed. Suggested remedies are also general: the well-being of the body, it is presumed, is the well-being of the cell. But if low interest does not distribute as well as create demand for a unit of labour per unit of production, it will not eradicate unemploy- ment.42 "How unsuitable," says Beveridge, summing up a masterly analysis of the British insurance figures, "is unemployment for abstract theorizing in general terms.... The beginning of an understanding of the unemployment problem is to break it up," and he goes on to suggest improved organization of the labour market.43 Now figures like these are not the whole story, and it is their proportional effect which counts.44 But neither can advice be "lifted" out of macroscopic cycle theory- dosing the patient without looking at him. So we may repeat our Canadian Census of Unemployment in 1941 (if we could extend it to capital and income a real critique could be written), unless, of course, the world equilibrates its equilibrium in the meantime; at present, equilibration is proceeding via measures to exterminate the species.45 42Incidentally it is not to be assumed that spreading jobs on the part-time principle does nothing to increase aggregate purchasing power and thus up-turn the cycle; it probably does (Hans Staehle, "Short Period Variation in the Distribution of Incomes" in Review of Economic Statistics, Aug., 1937, and Aug., 1938). 43W. H. Beveridge, "An Analysis of Unemployment" (Economica, Nov., 1936, and May, 1937). Also his Unemployment a Problem of Industry (London, New York, ed. 3, 1912). The Archbishop of York's Committee points the same moral, under Mr. Haw- trey's nose (Men Without Work: A Report made to the Pilgrim Trust, Cambridge Uni- versity, 1938) as does the course of recent empirical economics in Germany. Certain of Beveridge's a priori statements require qualification for Canada, e.g., an increased demand for labour will not produce insufficiency of supply and a rise in wages as readily as in Great Britain, owing to our larger reserve of potential wage-earners. 44The law of gravitation is not that bodies attract each other, but that the attraction is proportional to the product of their mass divided by the square of their distance. But the distribution factor in employment has been overlooked and is certainly of first importance. 45Expenditures of 60 nations on armaments have increased from $3.8 billions in 1932 to $17.6 billions in 1938. 165</page><page sequence="16">166 The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science Housing.-A foot-note on housing, the supply of which is more responsive to variations in income than in building costs, as the trade cycle knows. Less known is it that the rate of increase of number of rooms per person at progressive earnings levels tends to be highest in the middle earnings groups, while the ratio of rent to earnings actually increases for a brief interval in the lower groups. In other words, a simple statement of Engel's law requires qualification as a description of housing expenditure. Such at any rate emerges from certain Canadian Census analyses,46 which are also suggestive of how the equating of crowding and the evaluation of the low rent problem may be approached. They make two points abundantly clear: first, sampling surveys, of which we have so many nowadays, are intelligible and safe for generali- zation only if based upon census "controls" made possible by cross- classification of earnings, rent, size of household, number of rooms per household, etc.; secondly, there is a basic relationship between income and the adequacy of housing. Yet the League of Nations is sponsoring a World Housing Census which leaves income out of the picture-are sociologists interested? Population.-In this widest field of all, recent theory is modest,47 but "standard authorities" should not preach birth control, in 1930 and proliferation in 1937, however Canute-like either time,-it is dis- concerting. I could wish we might likewise catch up on that continental myth, immigration. Now, population is very practical politics: a country definitely must know what is, and whither tends, its population. This includes, (1) all about each population attribute in itself, and (2) the interplay of attributes upon the composite. Especially must Canadians give themselves to think in these channels, for we are but 11 millions on half a continent, much counsel do we suffer on it. The counsel would be bearable if it appreciated Canada's growth process-which is, that we have increased by four times since 1850, but so has the area popu- lated ("area" means space that can be occupied under current incomes and standards of living). It is the relation of area to population nucleus that is important. Our original settlement proceeded from points of distinct saturation, for troughs not levels were left in the rear: 87 inner counties in Canada out of 219 have smaller populations today than 460f dwellings by class, tenure, and number of rooms, collected on the population schedule. 47Cf. Lionel Robbins's "melancholy reflection" ("The Optimum Theory of Popula- tion" in London Essays in Economics ed. T. E. Gregory and H. Dalton, London, 1927). "To-day we are as ignorant of the causes which govern the birth rate as we were ignorant a century ago of the causes which govern the death rate" (J. B. S. Haldane, "Society as a Biological Experiment" in Human Affairs ed. by R. B. Cottell, J. Cohen, and R. M. W. Travers, London, 1937).</page><page sequence="17">Science and Society thirty, forty, or fifty years ago, or we would have a million more people. On top of land settlement, a second (city) growth-impulse has worked itself out, likewise a spreading. We are told ex cathedra that populations do not act in this way, but ours does. How many of such processes are written into our fate we do not know and no "projection" will tell us, though a new cycle is looming. Overspeed has been the prevailing mistake. An interesting fact is, that though no simple curve fits our growth alone, a logistic does fit a compound of growth and area. The Drosophila melanogaster bottle was closed: the Canadian bottle is an expanding one.48 A by-product is our extraordinary situation vis-a-vis our very con- venient neighbour. We have but 350,000 American-born in Canada, but 1,250,000 or about 14 per cent of all living Canadian-born are in the United States; extend this to persons of Canadian stock, and a third of us are in the Republic, mostly in clusters just over the border, but we do not call them Sudetens. In the 'eighties, for every thousand added to the native-born in Canada, we donated 726 to you: even in the 1920's we donated 228 per 1,000. Most comment on this is cant. In this last decade, Canada's total population increased by 1,589,000, but as excess of births over deaths was 1,582,000, and as 335,000 Cana- dian-born returned from the United States, we had 330,000 Canadian- born alone in excess of our increase. Yet we received one and a half million immigrants. Fluidity like this explains why the "optimum" discussion is even more vapid to us than to others, and why a new chapter in the Malthusian controversy is just a sweepstake without a ticket. Omnibus interpretation by all means. But what omnibus? We mustn't take the wrong one. Nothing could be more encouraging than the United States Report on Population of the National Resources Committee, which surely sets a new mark.49 In Canada also we "know our way around," though Sweden and the Netherlands beat the world in up-to-the-minute book- keeping. In this new atmosphere I should like to see the various census 48As items: The Maritime Provinces of Canada are in contrast with many other sections of the continent; no new natural resources have been developed, no territory has been added, nor have they experienced much stimulus of industrialization. For Nova Scotia the trend of population from the earliest times until the present forms a logistic, with a slowing up above the point of inflection concurrently with movements into Western Canada and the United States. These episodes over, the curve is returning to form, pending a new cycle. From Jacob to the Census of Moses, and from the earliest settlement of the French until the present is about the same time lapse: the growth of the two populations is the same. 49Supplemented by Needed Population Research, prepared by P. K. Whelpton under the auspices of the Population Association of America (New York, 1938). 167</page><page sequence="18">168 The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science offices borrow a leaf from the astronomers, and work co-operatively. There should be a minimum list of census rubrics, and agreement as to cross-classifications. Over and above domestic uses, the fields which need intensive treatment could be parcelled out, and we could help each other with special data.50 (We have produced a census machine in Canada that has multiplied such analyses to finality at half the old cost: the United States was the first to develop a census tabulator, but we have the last and best so far! it sorts and in the same run takes off everything on the card, adding up incomes, time series, etc.!) Only in some such way will we conjoin with biology, sociology, human ecology, in a real science of population, when "robust common sense" like Dr. Johnson's on the birth-rate will pass out,51 together with some latter- day pontification its lineal descendant. As just said, the astronomers' Nautical Almanac (not altogether nautical) is a demonstration visible even to the naked eye of the layman.52 Moreover, the I.I.S. has paved the way, and the Population Union offers a forum. One would not add to "the things of Mary" amid the din and dither of the have's and the have-not's still murdering the Gracchi and prophesying war. But I would think a world census understanding as hopeful a la Martha as, say Sefior de Madariaga's World Bank or World Mandates scheme. It is true that Sefior de Madariaga describes himself as "born in Spain, but a citizen of the world." V. NEW ATLANTIS But I am overshooting-I come back to the substantive part. The job of defining what applied science has done to society is statistical, and the defining will tell a lot of what to do about it. And the first step towards setting statistics to work in the grand manner thus is their organization in what Knibbs once called an "articulated conspectus" of the national life and affairs. In brief, the statistics of governmental activities, with those created for information, should be subsumed in a general plan, horizontally as well as vertically organized, looking to complete and systematic exploitation of the overhead. The purpose is simply to see the structure whole and as a unison, so that when an essential is missing we shall know continuously, (a) that it is missing; "Of course, there must be more censuses, and some quaint methods of the past must disappear (see R. R. Kuczynski, Colonial Population, Toronto, 1937); and of course vital and migration statistics must keep pace. 51Udny Yule calls it nonsense, but not Harold Wright (Population, New York, 1923, p. 102). 52The International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (35 adhering nations) supplies another.</page><page sequence="19">Science and Society (b) why it is missing; and (c) just how and where to make it good. A first-rate example is the need we are just discussing; but if we have a co-ordinated scheme of production and trade statistics in their social and economic setting, with the interested government agencies tied into it, any special point of view like this can be elaborated or superimposed at a fraction of the cost and labour otherwise. I believe that (1) the Committee set up by the International Council of Scientific Unions, which has the "Science and Society" matter in hand; (2) the League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Co-operation, which also has the identical matter in hand; and (3) the new section of the British Associa- tion, which also is to tackle the problem de novo and to link up with some similar body here (a World Brain Trust it is already maliciously called-let it not become too Ezekiel-like); would do well, on the principle of first things first, to give attention, not to the creation of new agencies for more materials-not to the ad hoc creation of new materials-but to this basal matter of organizing the agencies and recreating the materials we already have, just as the multitudinous and orderly enrolment of stars has been the arduous prelude to astronomy. They must come for this, I fear, like everyone else nowadays, to govern- ments, for governments alone have the two things needful, the powers and the money. To multiply statistics into universes with the needful cross-classifications; to ensure homogeneity so that they shall be usable from multiple points of view; to see that they relate to government and life in as wide a way as the machinery permits, and to point where necessary to further sensible and economical machinery; only organi- zation as an end in itself can compass this. At the top, free and using such organization as working arm, let there evolve great Institutes for Inductive Social Research, to the substitution-with Aristotle's "in- evitability of gradualness," with Science's "approaching truth by successive approximations"-of judgment for improvisation in our important affairs. Under those portals let no idola either of the tribe, the den, or the market place enter (Hogben would say no Idol of Logic, of Purity, or of Caution). Statistics is first of all les statistiques: nature is not so kind as in the natural sciences-we have to make our matter. In this connection one grows tired of hearing of "amorphous masses of purposeless knowledge." Purposeless for what? Most of God's factual chilluns got wings. There was a day when I thought the economists would take this in hand, and some have Nobly: Mr. Keynes never ceases scolding, and Wesley Mitchell once went so far as to say that government statisticians should have more pay. But mostly statistics are mentioned hopelessly, like something forgotten at the picnic, though Pigou as we saw likens 169</page><page sequence="20">The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science economists to clothiers, and clearly clothiers have an interest in the textile industry. And I regret to add that cantankerousness in statisti- cians is not unknown. A Zionist movement, even to a Palestine with no Arabs, has less allure sometimes than spoiling the Egyptians. But the diaspora is reassembling. Specialization in statistics, as in medicine, is the opposite of decentralization: it is the water-tight compartment that is bureaucratic. Here James has a hint for us. His prime exploit was to round up the turbulent Scottish nobility in fealty to the common law. Of this it is enough to remark (of course a propos de bottes) that of his six immediate predecessors in the task two were murdered, two fell in battle, one died of chagrin, whilst James himself was more than once the mark of private war. James by the way whittled down his Divine Right of Kings from in abstracto to in concreto-in other words when faced with hard realities he backed away, as an apriorist always should do, for all he may have the better of the logic.53 As for research, the crown of the edifice, he would be insatiable who was not happy in American progress, reaching apex in the Social Science Research Council. In Ottawa you may stand upon a bridge and view the palace of the National Research Council, builded of enthusiasm in the natural sciences. On the other hand is the Bureau of Statistics (it would bore statisticians to dwell in marble halls) crammed with the "makings" of social research of more than local import. Our model has been, shall we say Engel? that great organizer and empiricist.54 As for theoretic demands (Bacon's experimenta luctifera as well as fructifera) why not list those amenable to observation and the statistics they need, hoping that when these are cleared up the unamenable may by the mercy of Providence turn out mostly of no practical use-as they have done elsewhere in Science. In the direct application, one need fear neither Mill's nor Edgeworth's warning as to empiricism, for in such a milieu is created that atmosphere of "the artisan thinking about his job" which Salter says accounts for most practicalities: the most important parts of the steam engine were invented by labourers.55 And 53James's son Charles lost his head and his grandson the throne over it (or so the Whigs have always made out, soft-pedalling bourgeois objection to taxes during an upswing of the trade cycle), but not James. It was Cromwell, Ruler (self-elected) of the Saints (self-styled), who called democracy "the Creed of all Bad men and Poor men." 54The Dominion Bureau of Statistics, a brochure issued on the occasion of the Con- ference of British Commonwealth Statisticians (Ottawa, 1935). 55Sir Arthur Salter, The Framework of an Ordered Society (New York, 1933). Edge- worth considers that if the investigation of the conditions which determine value (the job par excellence of abstract economics) were abolished, "there would survive only the empirical school flourishing in the chaos congenial to their mentality." But Hayek, who quotes this against planning, comments, "we are as far from capitalism in its pure form as we are from any system of central planning. The world of today is just inter- ventionist chaos." 170</page><page sequence="21">Science and Society it is with the man on the job too that will burgeon that new technique (as with the biologists), which sets the pace for all the rest, still only mewing its youth. One may walk warily (per ignes suppositos cineri doloso) over inverse probability vs. maximum likelihood, but yet wish well of R. A. Fisher's simple "making sense of figures," the reduction of the multitudinous so that it can enter the mind, the open mind.56 Our "method" has certainly not lacked breadth in these late marvellous years, but has it realized conceptual depth? Neyman is demanding a "grammar" of statistics.57 The National Economic Council Movement of the 'twenties has some lessons. About 30 were set up in as many countries. Some were for quasi-executive jobs, -and these they may have done well enough. But where in the absence of statistical organization they have taken on research, they have petered out or gone on footling errands. The natural sciences can be better satisfied with guerilla warfare than the social. Sweden's newly formed Konjunctur-Institut (to name the absent) is promising. But how shall we "put across" such doctrine? It is trite to say, by education-but what else? Miss Walker has most adequately reviewed our university teaching of statistics.58 (I could wish statistical teaching were less "ancillary"-that it had the "sweep" of our Association.) She did not include Canada: I grieve to say she would have found no chair of statistics, and that five of our twenty-two universities do not know the word in their curricula-it is either contrary to the Koran and impious, or agreeable to the Koran and superfluous. Hogben jeers at universities that are never "lying in" hospitals to new sciences, and indeed it is forty years since Pearson declared the logic of statistics as important to teach as the analysis of mathematics.59 Galileo proceeded by capturing the universities. We statisticians cannot make a "close 56"In deductive reasoning all knowledge obtainable is already latent in the postulates . the successive inferences growing less and less accurate as we proceed. In inductive reasoning we are performing part of the process by which new knowledge is created. The conclusions normally grow more and more accurate as more data are included. That errors in the knowledge postulated a priori will produce less and less effect on the conclusions drawn as the observations are made more and more abundant seems to be a reason not for thinking that the postulate is true but rather that it must be possible to draw valid conclusions without its aid" (R. A. Fisher, "The Logic of Inductive In- ference" in Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, vol. XCVIII, part I, 1935).

The future of statistical quality in no small measure depends on our esprit de corps. Still it is public opinion that counts, and the school is more important than the college. Alexandrians like Eratosthenes and Apollonius knew that the earth was round, and how big it was, that the sun was 90,000,000 miles away, and so on, but Epicurus who guessed the sun was two feet wide won out for 1,500 years.60 Progress is never faster than popular thinking. High-school in my day took us to binomial theorem, but statistics were like railway time tables. It is even so today; "from him that hath not shall be taken even that which he hath" is still a moral conundrum, not just a fact as Pascal showed the gamblers of the seventeenth century (and so on to the life table and all that has come of it). Statistics is "solid" with big business, but many a business failure results from naivete over short and long chances.61 Statistical thinking, says H. G. Wells, will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and to write. I believe I mentioned money, and that our governments had it. They must have, for their united debt is over $40 billions. But the money part should be easy (and without James's guile in money matters -qui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare). Put it this way: Any business man having $1,000 to spend would gladly pay $8 or $10 for sound factual guidance.62 Apply this to governments and it would enlarge us by four or five times. We could pay over then "in our stride" the whole large sum which it is said an indigent world gave the natural sciences last year, and tune them in to social needs as during the war, not holding them up as Lord Stamp suggested-nay, cheering them on. Of course, it is comparatively easy for "Science" to raise funds, with the Marconis "selling" the Clerk Maxwells. But on social meliorism, the world is still like Huckleberry Finn, who when he prayed for a fishing line and was told to ask only for spiritual gifts, just passed it up altogether. But even poets like Tom Harrison are taking up mass observation in Great Britain: they are only statisticians with their tongues in their cheeks.63 Reverting to popular education, may I proffer an "idea"?

But statistics needs a whole book of the kind-early as the day is. Miss Walker is splendid, but I am thinking for non-statisticians. Moreover, the book should show how social needs have produced the new data and methods, as Westergaard and Koren have partly done. Why should physics and mathematics have all the thrillers? Hogben writes "for fun" from sick beds and railway coaches. Statisticians are even busier than biologists, and Miss Walker seems "it," brutal as it sounds. She will avoid some ebulliencies. At this shall I "share" completely like the Oxford Group? You will recall that the New Atlantis was to have had a second "social" part. But Bacon was before statistics, and "the rest was not perfected." In the first enthusiasm for this paper I tried to imagine that unbuilded House of Solomon,64 uniquely dedicate to means as much as ends: its Towers and Gardens; its Merchants of Light, Compilers, Interpreters, and the others; at its head the Father of the House who, says Bacon, "had an aspect as if he pitied men." I could not visualize it save in the four great rooms of the Magna Instauratio, statistics and research the third and fourth and most opulent,-equating, synthesising, catalysing this world of "becoming," in terms of occurrences and frequencies. But on closer view some difference developed in me between a mind to such an undertaking and the mind-so this goes over, shall I say for E. B. Wilson? I do not doubt (for we are not Spenglerians) that creative vision, a rubbing of the eyes to significances in recent scientific thought, with a schema not in shackles but still a schema, is what we need. There are no greater obstacles in the way of the social sciences-no more undiscovered techniques-than were in the natural sciences when "large brow'd Verulam" conceived his New Atlantis. VI. PROLIFERATION "Here then were an end, if ever anything had an end," but let us have our Pisgah moment. Political Science.-Our ploughshare is for Economics and Sociology first, but these will more consciously stem from Political Science in our new New Atlantis. Don Marquis was once a census clerk but he did not learn from the census to make archy the cockroach say:65 i never think at all when i write nobody can do two things at the same time and do them well, for a census must think from forty angles. In any event the happy 64James was "Solomon" to his court-"save only in the matter of wives and concu- bines." 65Archy and mehitabel (New York, 1935). Archy could not reach the capitals on his typewriter. 173</page><page sequence="24">174 The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science state (which will take the first perfect census, compiling it in a few weeks on the Canadian machine) is assuredly the free state, deriving from that muniment of freedom won in James's reign-freedom of parliamentary debate. It was once a fear of Lord Bryce that democratic parliaments "obviously" could not gauge public opinion. But today statistics can gauge it while we wait, and at a thousandth the cost of an election.66 It emerges that public opinion on occasion wants incom- patibles (to the gross peril of vox populi vox dei), and though "it is better to go wrong in freedom than right in chains" (T. H. Huxley), the price of going wrong is going up-we bomb civilians now. This Freedom has never been perdurable: Greece had it and debauched it; Rome had it and crushed it; kept alive by the primitive Church it committed suicide in the French Revolution. Science, which has brought government into every walk in life, has undoubtedly increased authori- tarianism, and we have returned to the age of heroes-familiar, bellicose somnambulists who are not asleep one bit. Two remedies have been suggested, each showing our bent statistics-ward. Now that the universe is finite, whether of.the Einstein or de Sitter pattern, Bertrand Russell wants a census of it, for then "venturous and enquiring intellects" will turn to other fields, (as previously from geometry to physics) "altering the whole structure of human life," since our present acquisitive society is only the reflection of our interest in physical laws.67 The alternative is closer to earth and humdrum: that the free state try and become expert, of which the first task is to distinguish good discipline from bad regulationism, by methods on which in the purely political part an ex-president of our Association has written a good book.68 The hero's attitude to statistics is significant. Napoleon, whose liberalism never interfered with dynastic business merely banned them publication. But the moderns have multiplied them beyond all precedent-so much so, the London Economist hints, that they have even statistics for themselves and statistics for giving out-the "splendid lie" of Plato with a vengeance. In these complexities and perplexities a Russian statistician or two have been shot, so we have our martyrology, one hopes a hagiology. Ethics.-And still I have not mentioned the Good, the Beautiful, the True. Whitehead removes the aesthetic beyond science in the realm 66George Gallup, "Government and the Sampling Referendum" (American Statistical Journal, vol. XXXIII). 67Our obsession by economic interest is, in R. H. Tawney's excoriation (The Acquisi- tive Society, New York, 1920), "as local and transitory as it is repulsive and disturbing . as pitiful as the obsession of the seventeenth century by religious quarrels." 68Stuart Rice, Quantitative Methods in Politics (New York, 1928). Cf. also P. Sargant Florence, The Statistical Method in Economics and Political Science (New York, 1929).</page><page sequence="25">Science and Society of Philosophy,69 from whose door if we retire on tiptoe it is not without lingering looks, for Science and Psychology are jamming it, and Statistics is not Mr. Worldly Wiseman but Everyman. Of values, by their fruits ye shall know them (Matthew, vii, 20). In Ethics, for example, wherein theology, psychology, and jurisprudence commingle, the new criteria of science are for our measurement:70 in fact we are already measuring prohibitions, whether of institutional law (crime), or of the legislator within the breast (sin). Of succedent punishment (somewhat abated of late by the abolition of hell),71 we still believe that knowledge of law and a desire to do right are the only expertise of a judge, and so blunder ignorantly between sentimentalism and obscurantism, but only until statistics rewrite criminology and penology. Law itself in the days of the Ecclesiastical Polity had its seat in the bosom of God, creating vagabonds with one edict and disposing of them neatly on the gallows with another. But like the Archbishop in Saint Joan we are less glib than we were with the name of God (who banishes malaria on the fair condition that we liquidate the mosquito), and jurisprudence upgrows from practice and the "wilderness of single instances."72 From the jural concept emerges free-will, that age-old dialectic. Quetelet's "budget of the scaffold" exorcised it in vain, and the physicists argue anew the paradox of a predictable crowd and an unpredictable unit. Predictability is mere numbers. Democracy by the same token 69A. N. Whitehead, Science and the Modern World (Cambridge University Press, 1930). 70"Hygiene has transformed resignation in face of epidemic disease from a religious virtue to a punishable offence.... Institutions based on short lives have almost wholly collapsed."-Daedalus. 71'We must accommodate our eschatology to a view of the Universe which leaves no room for a geographical heaven and hell" (Dean Inge, Scientific Ethics, London, 1927). 72As to international law, still wallowing in make-believe ingeminating peace in terms of war, Sir Alfred Zimmern ("The Decline of International Standards," Inter- national Affairs, Jan.-Feb., 1938) describes the League of Nations' Japanese policy as a "double bluff," first because the jus gentium based on the Christian ethic has dis- appeared among European nations, and secondly because Japan is not Christian. Or as Senior Ortega y Gasset puts it, "the League was a gigantic juridical machinery created for the administration of a non-existent law" ("Concerning Pacificism," Nineteenth Century, July, 1938). Yet radio has brought the world within sound of a herald's voice -which was Aristotle's limit to the size of a state; we are not a plurality of nations but a world society; and in general as someone says it should be easier to love your neigh- bour when you do not have to see him and live with him. If war is psychologic as well as economic, statistics will let Norman Angell distinguish the two faces. "The people who do most completely what is in fact to their interest are those who, on moral grounds, do what they believe to be against their interest" (Icarus). Or, as P. G. Wodehouse says, we must be kind and not leave it all to the Boy Scouts. 175</page><page sequence="26">176 The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science is the best science: in its collective mind as well as physical body is the hope of a sane, orderly, and progressive world. Beauty.-As to the beautiful, we are measuring the mechanics of its provocation and apperception, and Max Eastman is asking what literature will do a thousand years hence when trained investigators "with statistics and laboratory findings under their bulging arms" may have the last word on everything.73 Why do "burlicue" and the "hog- wash of the movies" climax our present-day aesthetic (the American Mercury and Aldous Huxley respectively say they do), and why in spite of painless dentistry do we not write poems of happiness like the Jacobeans? Beauty, Lord Haldane that good Hegelian declares, lies "beyond measurement," but he adds that it is the quality of anything relative to its end-not exactly the beauty of the Symposium.74 Taste and fashion, says Sainte-Beuve, are next-door neighbours, and to Science after its orgy of Victorianism we owe the simplicity and purposefulness of contemporary art. As to poetry, which Aristotle held to be "a higher thing" (o-rovSaL6Etpov) than history, Dingle and Bertrand Russell make merry over lines in In Memoriam.75 Poetry like music does not make sense, it makes emotion: And you shall hear the herb and tree, The better heart of men shall see, Shall feel celestially, as long As you crave nothing but the song.76 If Plato banished poetry for plain lies, will science banish "the song?" The last biographer of Ruskin says his economics misfired not because they were wrong, but because Ruskin was a drug addict-his drug the emotive and overwhelming majesty of the James Bible.77 73Max Eastman, The Literary Mind (New York, London, 1931). Contemporaneously, Sefior Fassi is making a statistical analysis of the perforations on player piano rolls (Appunti di statistica musicale, Rome, 1936). Plato's preference for the Dorian and Phrygian modes over the Ionian and Lydian had a mathematical explanation. 74Viscount Haldane, The Pathway to Reality (London, 1926). Lord Haldane lived in the age of the bustle (et ego in Arcadia vixi), and no doubt found it beautiful, though the later Haldane calls it a revolution when man's ideal woman ceased to be steatopy- gous. 750f any event "to which the whole creation moves," says Bertrand Russell, a more correct description would be "to which some parts of creation move while others move away from it," adding that "an emotion which can be destroyed by a little mathematics is neither very genuine nor very valuable." And Dingle says that the lady of the line "the stars she whispered blindly move" might have been comforted by reflecting that she was not a star. George Moore (An Anthology of Pure Poetry, New York, 1924) calls "pure poetry" only poetry which is objective, born of admiration of the world of things. 76George Meredith, "The Lark Ascending" (Poems, vol. I, London, 1898). 77Ruskin "largely failed in his life's endeavours for the simple reason that he could not write ... he was incapable of using language as a precise means of communicating</page><page sequence="27">Science and Society Religion.-The word brings me to religion, which is not conduct, though good conduct is a necessity to the mystical experience, even of the neo-mystics like Aldous Huxley.78 The conflict between religion and science has changed since our youth, when Mr. Gladstone and Bob Ingersoll, for example, dealt to each other across the Atlantic such resounding thwacks-they still resound from Tennessee where 7r=3 as at the building of the temple (II Chron. iv, 2). But preoccu- pation with revelation has turned or returned (pointed by Science) to Whitehead's "adventure of the spirit," which in set terms is not a "rule of safety" from the "curse" which is the end-word of the Old Testament.79 Meanwhile Science has a new humility-the humility of statistics. In the dichotomy80 (whose everyday bridge is in social ethics), Curtis compares the progress of observational knowledge to a hyperbola which "will never touch the two straight lines to which it is referred, though it will asymptotically come infinitely close after the lapse of unlimited time."81 This at least charts the paradox of the Spencerian Unknowable, and yet our unending quest of it, to which Spencer himself relates all our progress from Caliban-Man still only in the making, still able to greet the unseen with a cheer.82 Of the religious in statistics ordered thought . . . again and again a paragraph begins as precise writing and ends as emotive rhetoric" (R. H. Willenski in The Great Victorians, London, 1934). But Professor Knight wants economics to be "literature" (The Trend of Economics). 7SAldous Huxley, Ends and Means (London, 1937). 79Darwin delivered the nineteenth century from anthropomorphism, and we have likewise survived the succeeding mechanicomorphism, books like Henry Drummond's Natural Law in the Spiritual World (London, 1902) marking the transition. Cf. also Bradleys "approximation of knowledge and aspiration . . . so that religion may satisfy the soul of the saint and not disgust the intellect of the scholar." Hogben has dis- interred the bishop who calculated from Numbers that man was created by the Trinity on October 23, B.C. 4004, at nine- o'clock in the morning, but it is idle sport: within the year the Anglican Commission on Doctrine has rejected both the infallibility of the Scriptures and the resurrection of the physical body-a far cry from the tocsin over Vestiges of Creation, the Origin of Species, or even Essays and Reviews. 800f a non-sensible reality: Jung would admit the mystic to the laboratory; but Eddington's truths of science are not truths but truisms: "non-metrical" laws, the statistical and the transcendental, lie beyond. So likewise Jacques Maritain, the twentieth-century Aquinas ("vae mihi si non thomatizavero") divides science from metaphysics, and both from the mystical union with God, of which Emily Bronte's "Last Lines" remain surely the supreme expression (Jacques Maritain, The Degrees of Knowledge, London, 1937). But Santayana would not call the mystical experience (including Hindu Yoga, Buddhist Dhyana, Mohammedan Sufism, Jewish Cabalism) "truth." 81H. D. Curtis, "Receding Horizons" (Scientific Monthly, Sept., 1938). 82Even in a "pessimist" like Thomas Hardy: Consciousness the Will informing till It fashion all things fair (concluding line of The Dynasts). Bernard Shaw wears his hope with a difference: "Man is on trial. If we are a mistake, God will use other creatures a trifle less stupid to carry on His purpose." 177</page><page sequence="28">178 The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science let Florence Nightingale, though pre-war, be exemplar-the "passionate statistician" she was called. The world, she believed, was evolved in accordance with a divine plan which it was man's business to discover. "But to understand God's thoughts she held we must study statistics," which thus became for her a religious duty. Her religion was of works, for she was the means of establishing the first Chair of Statistics in an English university.83 VII. L'ENVOI And so having won to the odium theologicum I fitly end on the James Leitmotiv born of this occasion. How James would embellish "Science and Society," Heaven knows. But, says Gardiner, "James usually sensed better than other people what sort of thing it was desirable to do"-an apriorist with a sense of smell; and for certain personal qualities, as I said, even a statistician may warm to this many-sided, modest man, "rather born to onus than to honus,"84 scornful of popularity. Whether or not he was Prospero, he had imagination (he was a fair poet) and he had humour, both essentials of our craft. His pedantry, like ours, was better than utopianism. If he "swam" witches, that was a priori Science-Scientific Demonology-in 161085 Also he "fustigated" the odd heretic: persecution was still good politics and not yet bad economics (we stop at a piece of rubber hose). As peace- loving as any statistician, James was always afraid that pistols would go off, nor did Woodrow Wilson nor Neville Chamberlain keep us better out of war in a Europe divided as today, in the words of a witty Canadian, "between nations practising the goose-step and nations practising the side-step." He even soothed the Irish. History in Detroit is "bunk," and elsewhere she changes her mind, and I for one am glad if by late accounts James is not the two-headed ass of Macaulay but a civilized, intelligent man-boreal but not arboreal. But I go on talking of him thus till the last late moment only because in one particular I feel his equal-if I may say it in these sloping days of my official life: James prized over all things his English throne, but he could exalt it no more than I do the generosity that has beckoned me at the ending of this pregnant century to be the President of the American Statistical Association.
