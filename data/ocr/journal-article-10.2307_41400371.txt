Reviewed by Rebecca Ragion Britain has its history of very civilized "rural writing," while the United States is home to wilderness writing. It would be interesting to report that Canadian nature writing is some skillful blend of the two, retaining the gentle demeanor of the country parson in a setting which rivals any in the world for "wildness." But in fact, Canada has not produced a Gilbert White or a Henry David Thoreau, or any combination of the two, and in part this is because of a very different kind of relationship its writers have had to the land. Wayne Grady sketches the broad outlines of this relationship, and some of the sig- nificant controversies arising from it, in his introduction to Treasures of the Place: Three Centuries of Nature Writing in Canada . Canadian critic Northrop Fry e introduced the concept of the "garrison mentality" to describe some of the différences he sensed between American and Canadian literary history. According to Frye, Canadian literature con- tains a view of nature which is overwhelmingly sinister and threatening, and</page><page sequence="2">1 84 THE GEORGIA REVIEW he speculates that just as Canadians built real physical fortresses against a "hostile" continent, so too did they raise psychological barriers to combat it. Canadians, in other words, never embraced the idea of a "regenerative" na- ture as Americans did, nor did they seek the partnership of "environmental reform" which American writers from Whitman to Willa Cather explored and celebrated. Novelist Margaret Atwood developed Frye's thesis further in her work Survival , but added an interesting new idea when she theorized that Cana- dians, unlike Americans, actually began to identify themselves with animal victims. Nature, so unrelentingly cruel from the human perspective, has no favorites: people and animals suffer alike. Canadians would not develop cul- tural heroes such as Buffalo Bill or Davy Crockett- hunters who triumphed over the natural world. According to Atwood, rather than celebrate the great exploits of human victors, Canadians seemed to sympathize more with ani- mals caught in the same struggle for existence as humans. While all cultures have their "animal stories," Canadian writers such as C. D. Roberts and Ernest Thompson Seton developed a slightly different version: narratives from the point of view of animal victims which preclude any form of "happy" ending. Unlike the animal tales of Jack London, for example, those in the Canadian tradition are not triumphant survivors, and their stories end with their deaths. Editor Grady takes to task the tendency for such views to monopolize the discussion of Canadian literature. He points out that in fact many writers- and particularly nature writers- have responded differently to their landscape. According to Grady, a "sense of wonder is the essence of all good nature writing," and he suggests that in both the United States and in Canada, "fa- miliarity with nature bred respect. . . . Once newcomers to Canada realized they were not sailing up the backside of Asia, they calmed down and took a good look around." Grady further suggests that Frye's thesis about the garrison mentality works fine as long as only poets or novelists are considered, but that nature writing itself is a special case: Roberts, Seton, Grey Owl and others were working toward "a return to a vision of nature in which Canis lupus and Homo sapiens could coexist in . . . wonder-filled harmony." It may be true that nature writers offer an alternative vision of the human relationship to nature, yet "wonder-filled harmony" has all the sickly and sentimental associations of a decadent romanticism. Although Grady makes a good case against Canadian literary icons, he is less successful at suggesting exactly how nature writers challenge the "garrison mentality." Oddly enough, the selections here do little in themselves to alter the rather traditional and formidable view that writers have had of the Canadian landscape. Over and over again, the reader is confronted by quantities of insects, by fierce cold and high-drifting snow. One of the earliest selections is from Peter Kalm, writing about eighteenth-century Quebec: "The country hereabouts is low</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 185 and woody, and of course the breeding place of millions of gnats and flies, which were very troublesome to us." Margaret Murie in the twentieth- century Yukon talks about the difficulty faced when eating because of the numbers of insects around them: "Bowl in hand you loosened the string of the head net, poked the spoon full of food into your mouth, and quickly let the net down again." Frederick Philip Grove writes about a blizzard that was so "harsh, so millennial-old, so antediluvian and pre-Adamic" that he still remembers "the sinking feeling in my heart, the awe, and the foreboding that I had challenging a force in Nature which might defy all tireless effort and the most fearless heart." Hugh MacLennan, writing about the Mackenzie River, speaks of "loneliness on a scale awe-inspiring," while R. D. Lawrence faces cold of thirty-five degrees below zero on his southern Ontario property. Overall, the impression one garners from the collection is that this is indeed an awesome land to be reckoned with, so much so that "wonder" seems hardly an adequate sentiment, and "harmony" is out of the question. Ultimately the book defines Canadian nature writing by gathering to- gether prose written about Canada, regardless of the author's national origins, and included here are fine selections from Peter Matthiessen and Barry Lopez. This of course complicates the question of whether or not there is something particularly Canadian about the collection. Is there anything that distinguishes Canadian nature writing in the way that, for example, it is possible to separate American nature writing from British? The key here rests with the selections of "animal stories" by Seton, Roberts, and Bodsworth, and with the mixture of fact and fiction that writers such as Farley Mowet and Grey Owl (who transformed Archibald Stansfeld Belaney, Englishman, into an Ojibwa guide) use to tell the stories of a place. These fictionalized accounts have had rough going in the past, beginning with John Burroughs' early attack on Seton, and they continue to have rough going today from literary critics who abhor any scent of anthropomorphism. Burroughs, an accomplished nature writer him- self, felt particular irritation with Seton, who wrote touching stories about animal heroes. "Such dogs, wolves, foxes, rabbits, mustangs, crows, as he has known, it is safe to say, no other person in the world has ever known," Bur- roughs wrote in the 1903 Atlantic Monthly article which launched the con- troversy over "real" and "sham" natural history. And yet the stories of Seton remain oddly touching, standing out in a field that insists on the "wonder" of nature while using the distancing techniques of an "objective" narrative stance. At the end of Seton's collection Wild Animals I Have Known , for example, Redruff the partridge is caught in a snare by a poacher: Have the wild things no moral or legal rights? What right has man to inflict such long and fearful agony on a fellow-creature, simply because that creature does not speak his language? All that day, with growing, racking pains, poor Redruff hung and beat his great,</page><page sequence="4">l8 б THE GEORGIA REVIEW strong wings in helpless struggles to be free. All day, all night, with growing torture, until he only longed for death. But no one came. The morning broke, the day wore on, and still he hung there, slowly dying; his very strength a curse. The second night crawled slowly down, and when, in the dawdling hours of darkness, a great Horned Owl, drawn by the feeble flutter of a dying wing, cut short the pain, the deed was wholly kind. An invitation to imagine the meaning of "fellow creature" is a crucial "Canadian" contribution to the field of nature writing. Wayne Grady has chosen wisely in his collection, by giving a generous sample of these animal stories and by concluding with a piece of fiction from Canadian novelist Sean Virgo. Clearly Grady is willing to include far more than the nonfiction prose essay in his definition of nature writing, something which in itself distin- guishes this book from recent collections published in the United States. Although his introduction could have provided a more thorough discussion of his sense of Canadian nature writing, Treasures of the Place nevertheless offers a long-needed introduction to a neglected field of study.</page></plain_text>
