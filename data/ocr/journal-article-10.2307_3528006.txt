<plain_text><page sequence="1">30 I Hastings Center Report, Special Issue, 1995 Does Environmental Ethics Need a Metaphysical Grounding? by Lawrence Vogel F or the past several decades until his recent death, Hans Jonas alerted us to an "ethi- cal vacuum" at the core of our culture: a vacuum caused by both traditional ethics and modem natural science.1 Technology today has altered the very nature of human action by allowing us to affect nature, both outside ourselves and within, in ways that are long-range, cumulative, irreversible, and planetary in scale. But traditional ethics has pre- sumed that the effects of our actions are quite lim- ited. With the exception of medicine, techne was be- lieved to be ethically neutral. Ethical significance be- longed to relations between humans, not between us and nature. Humanity was a constant, not an object of reshaping techne. And while the moral good or evil of our actions lay close at hand, the long run was left to chance, fate, or providence. But all of this has changed with the advent of modern technology, and traditional ethics leaves us ill-equipped to ac- count for our responsibilities when the very future of humanity is at stake. But this vacuum is intensified by the dominant scientific view of nature in the modern period: re- ductionistic materialism. On this view, nature is a ma- chine; it harbors no values and expresses no pur- posiveness. The idea that there are ends in nature is rejected as an anthropomorphic conceit. Extrahuman nature is indifferent to itself and also to human be- ings who are cast adrift in it. We may matter to our- selves, but there is no larger scheme of mattering to which we belong. Though human beings may be sub- jects who posit ends and act in light of purposes, nonhuman organisms are mere objects: matter in motion. And eventually humans, as part of nature, become objects of their own fabrications to be shaped according to the designs of biotechnology. If Laurence Vogel is an associate professor in the department of philosophy, Connecticut College, New London, Conn. Lawrence Vogel, "Does Environmental Ethics Need a Meta- physical Grounding?" Hastings Center Report 25, no. 7, Special Issue (1995): 30-39. nature presents us with no ethical norms, then no effort to change our own nature in the name of per- fection, convenience, or experimentation could count as a transgression of essential limits or a vio- lation of a natural standard of goodness. Herein lies the deepest root of our cultural crisis: nihilism. Lacking grounds for judging nature to be good and deprived of any stable "image of Human- ity" to which we owe reverence, we are unable to answer the fundamental ethical challenge posed by our novel powers: "Why should we care about the distant future of mankind and the planet?" Unable to justify why the presence of humankind on the earth is a categorical imperative, we are unprepared for the attitude of stewardship that we must cultivate if we are not to squander the future in the interests of a profligate present. This is the emergency of eco- logical ethics today. If nihilism is the cause of this emergency, then the only sufficient response would be a philosophical critique of nihilism. This is precisely the task that Hans Jonas sets for himself, and not only in his later writings, but from the very beginning. I shall show how his project unfolds in three stages: (1) existen- tial, (2) metaphysical, and (3) theological. Each stage is a response to the crisis of nihilism that Jonas di- agnoses in his early essay, "Gnosticism, Existentialism and Nihilism," the epilogue to his first major work, The Gnostic Religion. First, in The Phenomenon of Life, Jonas offers "an existential interpretation of the bio- logical facts," arguing that purposive existence is not a special attribute of human beings, but is present throughout living nature. Second, in The Imperative of Responsibility, he provides a metaphysical ground- ing of our ethical obligations to nature and to our- selves as special products of its evolutionary labors. Third, in his lecture "The Concept of God After Auschwitz," he presents a theology of divine creation that is consistent with both his existential and meta- physical views. I shall ultimately argue that Jonas does not take theology to be necessary for an overcoming of nihil- ism. Rational metaphysics must be able to ground an imperative of responsibility without recourse</page><page sequence="2">The Legacy of Hans Jonas I 31 to faith. Furthermore, while many environmental- ists presume that nonanthropocentrism must be a defining feature of any ecological ethics, Jonas does not believe that overcoming nihilism requires a renunciation of anthropocentrism in favor of biocentrism or ecocentrism. Instead, I shall con- tend, he tries to undercut the very distinction be- tween anthropocentrism and its supposed alterna- tives. Finally, I shall raise some critical questions about Jonas's project. In particular, I worry that a pluralistic culture cannot bear the burden of such a substantive metaphysics. If our future depends upon citizens agreeing with Jonas's speculations, then I fear we are not up to the task. But first let us explore the three stages along Jonas's way be- yond nihilism. A Responsible Existentialism The first stage on Jonas's way is reached in The Phenomenon of Life through an attack on his mentor, Heidegger, whose existentialism Jonas takes to be the most powerful expression of nihilism in our time. Jonas acknowledges Being and Time as "the most pro- found and important manifesto of existentialism," but criticizes Heidegger for restricting existential in- terpretation to human beings.2 Jonas begins his cri- tique of nihilism not by rejecting Heidegger's ap- proach altogether, but rather by extending his teacher's categories to yield an existential interpreta- tion of the biological facts. From Heidegger's per- spective, however, the very idea of an existential in- terpretation of the biological facts must sound like an oxymoron. It would be inappropriate to interpret nonhuman organisms existentially because only hu- mans "exist." We are the only beings whose Being is an issue for us: that is, whose behavior and expres- sion manifest a stance toward the sort of being we resolve to be within the constraints of our "thrown- ness." Whatever significance the rest of nature has, then, it possesses through the lens of our care. Jonas charges that Heidegger's fundamental on- tology does not fulfill its promise to delineate trans- historical structures of human existence. Instead, it bears testimony to the particular, historically fated situation of modern humanity: a situation defined by "the spiritual denudation of [the concept of nature] at the hands of physical science" since the Coperni- can revolution (p. 232). In Heidegger's analysis of existence, there is no room for nature as possessing intrinsic value, for nature is assumed to be a realm of "un-meaning" (sinnlos), only taking on signifi- cance in relation to our workaday world. As Karl Lowith puts it, "The world which is concretely ana- lyzed by contemporary existentialism ... is only our historical world of selfhood and interhuman rela- tions. . . . Nature, says Heidegger, cannot elucidate the ontological character of world and of our being because it is only a kind of being within our world, and we encounter it therefore within the analysis of man's being-there [Dasein]."3 Heidegger's supposedly ontological account of temporality presupposes the modern, materialistic understanding of nature in which there is no eter- nity, only the flux of time. This flux lacks a genuine present, according to Jonas, because, at the moment of decision, authentic Dasein stands unguided by any eternal measure; and this because Dasein is not seen as being part of "an objective order of essences in the totality of nature," but only as a "transessential, freely projecting existence" who must create values on the basis of nothing but the shifting soil of his- tory. The loss of eternity, Jonas contends, "accounts for the loss of a genuine present. .... If values are not beheld in vision as being (like the Good and the Beautiful of Plato), but are posited by the will as pro- jects, then indeed existence is committed to constant futurity with death as its goal; and a merely formal resolution to be, without a nomos for that resolution, becomes a project from nothingness to nothing- ness. . . . Will replaces vision; temporality of the act ousts the eternity of the 'good in itself."'4 Heideg- ger's existentialism, on Jonas's reading, uncritically accepts the metaphysical background of the nihilistic situation: the dualism between humanity and nature. The idea that nature has no ends and is indifferent to human purposes throws us back on ourselves in our quest for meaning. No longer able to find our place in a sacred order of creation or an objective order of essences comprising the totality of nature, we have lost not only the grounds for cosmic piety, but also a stable image of our own nature, even the conviction that we have a nature. Jonas writes, "That nature does not care, one way or another, is the true abyss. That only man cares, in his finitude facing nothing but death, alone with his contingency and the objective meaninglessness of his projecting mean- ings, is a truly unprecedented situation. .... As the product of the indifferent, his being, too, must be indifferent. Then, the facing of his mortality would simply warrant the reaction: Let us eat and drink. For tomorrow we must die. There is no point in car- ing for what has no sanction behind it in any creative intention" (p. 233). In other words, Heidegger's ex- istentialism gives us no good reason to care about future generations or the long-term fate of planet Earth. But existentialism, as we have seen, is not an idiosyncracy of modern thought; it is rather the most complete expression of "the ethical vacuum" caused by the two key assumptions of the modern credo: (1) that the idea of obligation is a human invention, not a discovery based on the objective being of the good-in-itself and (2) that the rest of Being is indifferent to our experience of obligation (p. 283). Jonas's whole philosophy aims at providing a reason- able account, consistent with modern science, of why it does make an objective difference how we relate to nature because living nature, from which our own caring selves emerge and on which we depend, is essentially good, is worth being cared for, and even cares that we care for her so that we, her most mag- nificent creation, can continue to be. What is so strikingly subversive about the first stage of Jonas's reply to nihilism is that he uses Heidegger's own existential categories as a point of</page><page sequence="3">32 I Hastings Center Report, Special Issue, 1995 departure for undermining the modern credo that human being is the source of all value in nature. By attributing "existence" to all organisms, not only hu- mans, Jonas challenges the metaphysical prejudice of materialism and begins to ground a heteronomy that supersedes all authenticity. Though only we humans can take stock of our lives as a whole, reflect on the ontological structure of existence, and be themati- cally aware of death, all organisms show concern for their own being and reach out to the world in order to fend off not-being. The materialist, of course, claims to remain metaphysically neutral and accuses those who impute purposes to nature of being all- too-metaphysical. But Jonas insists that one cannot offer a phenomenological description of an organ- ism's way of being without finding purposes in "the things themselves." Even the simplest organism's way of being is utterly different in kind from that of a lifeless object. Organisms are not mere destructible chunks of matter, but possess an inward relation to their own being. Their being is their own doing. Metabolism is the most basic expression of an organism's struggle for life. Each organism exhibits what Jonas calls "needful freedom." It is free with respect to its own substance: a dynamic unity, not identical with any si- multaneous totality of its parts. Yet it remains forever needful: dependent on exchange with an environ- ment that it must use to avoid dying. By clinging to itself, Jonas remarks, life says yes to itself.5 Only in confrontation with the ever-present potentiality of not-being can Being come to feel itself, affirm itself, make itself its own purpose. Through negated not- being, "to be" turns into "existence": a constant choosing of itself. Because all life is relation, and re- lation implies transcendence, polarities that we find in ourselves-being/not-being, self/world, form/mat- ter, and freedom/necessity-have traces in even the most primitive forms of life. Existential categories- concern, transcendence, freedom, possibility, world, not-being-are necessary to describe powers of mind (psyche) that are "objectively discernible" in all life. Some measure of "mind" (or "subjective inward- ness") and "freedom" are present at all levels of the life-world. Each new level of mind-metabolism, moving and desiring, sensing and perceiving, imagining and thinking-brings with it a new dimension of freedom and peril alike. Though all organisms share the vege- tative functions of nutrition and reproduction, the evolution of sensitive capacities in animals marks a major advance in the quality of freedom in the life- world. Whereas plants, moved by need but not de- sire, are immediately immersed in their surroundings and are at the mercy of adjacent matter and imping- ing forces, animals have a mediated relationship to their environment in virtue of their perceptual aware- ness of discrete things at a distance from them and their ability to move toward or away from these things in response to their passions. The "secret of animal life" is the gap they are able to maintain be- tween their immediate desires and mediate satisfac- tions. They participate in existential space and time because, as Jonas puts it, "motility guided by percep- tion and driven by desire turns 'there' into 'here' and 'not yet' into 'now.'"6 Among animals an inner dimension blooms forth and externalizes itself in be- havior and communication, yet at the same time there emerges a new liability: the capacity to suffer pain, fear, and even abandonment. Only with humans, and the interposition of an idea between subject and object, does mediacy be- come reflective: an explicit relation between a self- conscious subject and objects identified and classified as such. In our imaginations, we can make present what is materially absent. By comparing past and pre- sent perceptions we can discern between truth and falsehood. Furthermore, we can reflect upon es- sences or "thought-objects" in their own right. The eidetic capacity present in our power to recognize and create images as representations of objects is the root of our ability to live in light of an image of who we are and ought to be. And we are fundamentally metaphysical organisms, for we can, and even must, try to comprehend our place in the whole of which we are a part. Though the twofoldness of self-reflec- tion is the condition of having a "self" and of pos- sessing the special kind of freedom that Heidegger delineates when he calls us the only beings "whose Being is an issue for us," this split within the self is the source of perils peculiar to human existence: the threat of anxiety when we are deeply uncertain about what our standards should be, and the sting of un- happiness, guilt, and even despair when we judge ourselves unfavorably from the distance of our wishes, aspirations, and approvals. Once we recognize mechanistic materialism for what it is-a metaphysical prejudice, not a neutral description of the physical world-we are free to in- terpret the biological facts existentially and to appre- ciate the reality of value independent of us, for all organisms are "ends-in-themselves" who value what- ever contributes to their existence and welfare. This is not the case simply from our point of view, for we have no reason to doubt that they flourish or suffer in their own right. A crucial step in Jonas's reply to nihilism has been achieved, and one might think that there is little, if anything, more to be done. Once we see that humanity is not the sole locus, much less the creator, of all value in nature, we would seem to be in a position to accept our duty as guardians of living nature. But if our technological incursions into nature are destined to disrupt the ecosystem and destroy whole species at an unprece- dented rate, why would we not be doing nature a favor by taking ourselves out of the picture? Even if there are centers of purpose in nature outside of us that command our respect, it has not been shown that there is an overarching purposiveness in the evolutionary process as a whole in which we play a crucial role and by virtue of which we have an obligation to ensure that human beings remain among the Earth's citizens. Darwin's theory of evolution does not seem to be of much help in this regard, for it explains natu- ral history as a wholly mechanistic process in which</page><page sequence="4">rOdb%- -a! - t * _i ^^'_^^ ".4, _ -4 --bR&amp;jJLJ. 0 in '-4 a q) '4) I!

The official Darwinian view is resolutely antiteleological in hold- ing that life first came into being through spontane- ous generation from inorganic matter and evolved by chance through the joint processes of random ge- netic variation and natural selection. But Darwin's materialist explanation of evolution, according to Jonas, "contains the germ of its own overcoming" (p. 53) for, against the spirit of mind/matter dualism, evolution displays a continuity between nonhuman and human organisms. Rather than interpreting mind as an utterly novel and sudden emergence co- inciding with humans, Darwin makes room for the idea that the whole life-world is a chain of psycho- physical organisms whose minds and bodies co-evolve so as to allow for greater freedom and individuality. Being has achieved in us a being who can reflect her back to herself in thought. We can interpret our- selves as the outcome of a teleological process whose immanent purposes are self-knowledge and freedom: an evolution in which mind ultimately answers to the qualities that nature shows forth, and individuality, rooted in each organism's concern for its own being, reaches its maximal intensiveness in the capacity of each person to speak for himself and forge his own unique story. Against the reductionist tendency of modern thought which boils the complex down to its simplest parts, Jonas, in a synthesis of Aristotle, Hegel, and Darwin, finds the germ of what is higher in the lower forms from which it evolves. "Reality, or nature, is one and testifies to itself in what it allows to come forth from it."7 The extension of mind to the entire organic world enables Jonas in The Phenomenon of Life to make several speculative, metaphysical claims that cannot be proven but are consistent with the biological facts, existentially interpreted: (1) that mat- ter's feat of organizing itself for life attests to latent organic tendencies in the depths of being and (2) that the emergence of the human mind does not mark a great divide within nature but elaborates what is prefigured in all organic existence.8 These two points allow for a third speculation with dramatic ethical consequences: insofar as we see ourselves, with our capacity for reflecting Being in knowledge, as "a 'coming to itself' of original substance," we should understand ourselves as being called by na- ture, our own source, to be her guardian (p. 284). By extending the category of existence to all organ- isms, Jonas makes possible a radical conversion of modern thought: "a principle of ethics which is ul- timately grounded neither in the authority of the self nor the needs of the community, but in an objective assignment by the nature of things" (p. 283). A Rational Metaphysic But The Phenomenon of Life is only preliminary to the ethical task of The Imperative of Responsibility because the disclosure of value in nature is not yet sufficient to ground a principle of responsibility for the future. It is still possible, Jonas suggests, for a nihilist to acknowledge the presence of subjective value in being, of organisms willing their own exist- ence, while doubting "whether the whole toilsome and terrible drama is worth the trouble."9 Jonas wor- ries that "our showing up to now that Nature harbors values because it harbors ends and is thus anything but value-free, has not yet answered the question of whether we are at pleasure or duty-bound to join in her 'value-decisions'" (p. 78). Yet Jonas admits that once the immanence of purpose in nature has been shown "the decisive battle for ethical theory has al- ready been won" (p. 78). What must be established in the second stage of Jonas's reply to nihilism is the objective reality of value-a good-in-itself-because only from it can a binding responsibility to guard Being be derived. Jonas seeks to establish that the good is not relative to already existing subjective pur- poses, but rather that it is good that there is pur- posiveness in nature in the first place: that "the very capacity to have any purposes at all is a good-in-itself" (p. 80). Jonas admits that, empirically speaking, the quantity of suffering in life may well outweigh the sum of enjoyment. But, nonetheless, suffering rare- ly destroys the sentient self's will to live. "The very record of suffering mankind," writes Jonas, "teaches us that the partisanship of inwardness for itself in- vincibly withstands the balancing of pains and pleasures and rebuffs our judging it by this stand- ard."10 The metaphysical judgment of life's essential goodness cannot be made on hedonistic grounds. On the basis of the "intuitive certainty" that purposiveness is absolutely and infinitely superior to purposelessness in Being, Jonas derives the "onto- logical axiom" that "purpose as such is its own ac- creditation within Being."11 Being is "for itself"; and the facts bear testimony to the idea that Being favors the maximization and intensification of purposive- ness, ultimately the freedom and peril that comes with the human ability to think about, and deeply affect, nature as a whole. From these ontological premises, filled as they are with axiological signifi- cance, he draws the ethical conclusion that purposive nature, being good-in-itself, addresses an "ought" whenever it comes under the custody of a will. Though such a will must be infused with a feeling of responsibility in order to be moved by the ob- ject that obligates it, it must experience itself as responding to a transcendent summons in order for the moral sentiment "to be in its own eyes more than a mere impulse" (p. 86). Just as Jonas grounds the ontological goodness of Being as such prior to the ontic goods that are relative to the purposes of particular living beings, so he grounds the ontological goodness of human being prior to the goods that are relative to existing human individuals and to the rights that belong to them. Though from an ontic point of view our first commitment is to members of the present genera- tion, especially our kin (and nature guarantees it), this proves inadequate to the task of demonstrating a principle of responsibility for future mankind. For if the not-yet-existent have no rights, on what basis can there be a duty to ensure the possibility of their</page><page sequence="6">The Legacy of Hans Jonas 1 35 existence and the quality of their lives? Jonas argues that our first duty is ontological: future human indi- viduals matter because the idea of Humanity matters. "Since in [man] the principle of purposiveness has reached its highest and most dangerous peak through the freedom to set himself ends and the power to carry them out, he himself becomes, in the name of that principle, the first object of his obliga- tion, which we expressed in our 'first imperative': not to ruin (as he well can do) what nature has achieved in him by the way of his using it" (p. 130). Essential to the idea of Humanity is the capacity for re- The dut to ens sponsibility. The duty to ensure the future ence of mankinc existence of mankind to preserve his c includes the duty to preserve his essence by de mi g the C not undermining the man can show h conditions in which executor of a tn man can show himself to be "the executor of can see, but did a trust which only he can see, but did not create."12 Here we are reminded of a Heideg- gerian theme: a command of Being arouses our conscience and calls us to take responsibility. But in- stead of Heidegger's silent call of conscience com- manding us to own up to our ownmost possibilities in a moment of resolve in the face of nothingness, Jonas's call has moral substance because it emanates from the plenitude of Being. The expansion of exis- tential interpretation to include the biological facts allows Jonas "to ground an ethics in the depths of Being": to find value in nature and so to conceive of our freedom as subject to a heteronomous source of authority. The goodness of Being, reality, or nature opens up a genuine present because it gives us a future worth caring for. This is the mean- ing of Jonas's pointedly anti-Heideggerian motto: "Responsibility is the moral complement to the on- tological constitution of our temporality."13 The present, according to Jonas, is governed by an imperative to preserve the human essence forever, and this because our essence is the outcome of a natural process that is good. Our fundamental re- sponsibility is to that which allowed us to come into being, nature herself, but this responsibility is exer- cised first of all in our relationships to other human beings. The archetype of responsibility is the care of parent for child, where the goal of parenting is the perpetuation of the capacity for responsibility itself. "[The] highest fulfillment [of parenting], which it must be able to dare, is its abdication before the right of the never-anticipated which emerges as the outcome of its care. Its highest duty, therefore, is to see that responsibility itself is not stifled, whether from its source within or from constraints without" (p. 107). The ultimate ground for our duty to our children, however, is not our ontic relationship to ure tin .sse ond mi ist no them in particular, but our duty to humankind as such: to the idea of Humanity which is part of the idea of purposive nature. Has Jonas provided the glimpse of eternity that he claims is necessary to overcome the loss of a genu- ine present in Heidegger's nihilism? Jonas remains a modern in that he cannot rely on the vertical orien- tation of Platonic ontology which found the eternal beyond the transient: pure Being apart from becom- ing. Today, Jonas reminds us, it must be becoming rather than abiding na- ture that holds out the promise of a reunion between ontology and the future exist- ethics. But nature iclude the d uty evolves and can be ir- cludes the duty reversibly altered by Mnce by not un- our behavior. If all be- itions in which coming is simply change within nature self to be "the and not the destruc- which only he tion of nature, then t create." how can our spoiling of the environment or even collective suicide be a violation of na- ture? "We must seek the essential in tran- sience itself. It is in this context that responsibility can become dominant in morality. . . . Only for the changeable and perishable can one be responsible, for what is threatened by corruption" (p. 125). The good-in-itself is living nature, including humanity as the highest expression of nature's purposiveness. Un- like the permanent and indestructible Good of Pla- tonic ontology, Jonas's Good-our privileged, but delicate place within the totality of nature-is at the mercy of our actions. Insofar as our coming-to-be was "of cosmic importance," an "event for Being itself," it matters to Being that we preserve our existence and essence.14 Jonas hopes to have disclosed an ontological foundation for a principle of responsibility for the future. His ontological axioms-(1) that the very presence of purposiveness in Being implies that be- ing is better than not being and (2) that the idea of Humanity matters to Being itself as the maximal ac- tualization of its potentiality for purposiveness- ground his ethical axiom: "never must the existence or essence of man as a whole be made a stake in the hazards of action."15 And given scientists' uncer- tain ability to predict the long-term effects of our technological incursions into nature, Jonas's ethical axiom yields a "pragmatic rule": that we be cautious and only pursue modest goals, paying heed to proph- ets of doom before being seduced by prophets of bliss. Jonas chides utopians for being, in a sense, more pessimistic than prophets of doom, because the promise to perfect humanity presupposes that our nature is not essentially good enough already. For the sake of the perfect they would risk the good. The rhetoric of hope animating their "starry-eyed ethics of perfection" conceals contempt for the essential</page><page sequence="7">36 I Hastings Center Report, Special Issue, 1995 condition nature grants us. Against this, Jonas advo- cates the "sterner" ethic of responsibility, born of a veneration for "the image of man" and fear for what we might lose in the name of progress: a meliorism that aims at modest improvements in our lot. The link between nihilism and utopianism is the absence of veneration for the image of Humanity, and so the loss of a "genuine present" oriented by the "plain truth" that "genuine man is always already there and was there throughout known history: in his heights and in his depths, his greatness and wretchedness, his bliss and torment, his justice and guilt-in short all the ambiguity that is in- separable from his humanity" (p. 200). Beginning from an existential interpretation of the biological facts, Jonas accomplishes precisely the turn toward Being that Heidegger hoped to initiate by way of fundamental ontology, but could not ac- complish so long as existential categories were con- fined to the human way of being. Having so re- stricted his existential analysis, Heidegger could only see nature as a mode of being within our world, and so could not appreciate its intrinsic value or our con- tinuity with it. For Heidegger the turn toward Being spells "the end of metaphysics" because it reminds us that Being hides itself and that our approach to any supposed unconditioned ground is a conceit that necessarily bears the trace of our finitude. For Jonas, on the other hand, existential analysis provides the thread by which we can find our way beyond our- selves to what is good-in-itself. His expansion of "the ontological locus of purpose from what is apparent at the subjective peak to what is hidden in the breadth of being" (p. 71) permits him to make the metaphysical claim, though on admittedly speculative grounds, that Being reveals itself to contemplation if thought gives itself the right to transcend materialist assumptions about nature and hence to see the hu- man essence as part of a unified, continuous, intel- ligible order: what in older times was called a "great chain of Being." Existentialism, far from presaging the end of metaphysics, proves to be the beginning of a metaphysics that is compatible with the modern idea that being is dynamic and unfolds in time. A Complementary Theology We have now passed through the first two stages of Jonas's reply to the nihilist who asks, "Why should I care about the distant future of humankind and the planet?" The first, or existential, stage establishes the presence of "subjective inwardness"-mind, free- dom, value, and purpose-throughout the entire or- ganic realm. We are not aliens caught up in a lifeless machine, but citizens of a biotic community teeming with life. But the nihilist may still ask how we know that the presence of subjective value throughout the earthly environment is objectively good and so really worth protecting: not simply "'a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"' (p. 50). The second, or metaphysical, stage offers a grounding of the objective goodness of life and of our ethical obligation to safeguard the existence and essence of evolution's most sub- lime outcome: humanity itself. If Jonas has suc- ceeded, what more could the nihilist want? There is one last condition that the nihilist may believe is necessary to ensure that human life is worth caring for: namely, that we are creatures of a benevolent God. For if God does not exist, the ni- hilist may cry out, then we are but a flicker in the darkness and our prayers ultimately go unanswered in the silence of the universe. Jonas invites this worry when he asserts that "there is no point in caring for what has no sanction behind it in any creative inten- tion."16 One might assume, therefore, that theology comprises a necessary third stage for the overcoming of nihilism. Although Jonas does provide us with a theology that is compatible with his existentialism and metaphysics, he calls theology "a luxury of rea- son," not a necessity, and explicitly denies that nature needs to be created by God in order to ground an imperative of responsibility. If rational metaphysics proves insufficient on its own, then no appeal to a Creator will satisfy the nihilist. For if life can be shown to be worthwhile without reference to God, then whether God exists is superfluous to ethics. But if life cannot be shown to be worthwhile without ref- erence to God, then appealing to a benevolent Crea- tor will only provide hollow consolation for our ex- perience of life's worthlessness. In a reaction against theological voluntarism, whose conceptual formulation dates back to Plato's Euthyphro, Jonas insists that the cause of life's com- ing-to-be is irrelevant to the question of whether it ought to be, for if the world was created by a God worthy of our reverence, then the intrinsic goodness of the world must have been a prior and independ- ent reason for His creating it. The presupposition of a Creator offers us no reason for judging the world to be good if the world does not justify our percep- tion of its value in its own right. Theological volun- tarism runs the risk of lapsing into Gnostic dualism wherein faith is owed to a divine will that is wholly absent from the perceptible testimony of His crea- tion. Yet because theological rationalism posits the priority of the good-in-itself over God's will, it renders the question of life's authorship irrelevant to the is- sue of its goodness, and so cedes to metaphysics the task of providing a foundation for ethics.17 If the nihilist is to be defeated, reason must be able to replace revelation in the office of guiding our ultimate choices. But reason triumphant through modern natural science is precisely the root of nihil- ism. It undermines the cosmic piety that is supported by the Hebrew tradition, a tradition that Jonas iden- tifies with four key propositions: (1) God created heaven and earth, (2) God saw that His creation was good, (3) God created man in His own image, and (4) God makes known to man what is good because His word is inscribed in our hearts.18 It may seem, then, that theology provides the only alternative to the nihilism of modern reason. But I think that Jonas's metaphysics should be read as an attempt to preserve the meaning of the latter three biblical propositions on rational grounds without relying</page><page sequence="8">The Legacy of HansJonas I 37 upon theology at all. Once the metaphysical preju- dice of modern reason-materialism-has been chal- lenged byJonas's existential interpretation of the bio- logical facts, he can defend the three latter proposi- tions without recourse to the premise at the heart of the biblical tradition: that God created heaven and earth. In each case, we must be able to translate a theo- logical proposition into a naturalistic one. First, that "God saw that His creation was good" gets reinter- preted in Jonas's metaphysics as the good-in-itself of living nature whose very being imposes an "ought-to- be" whenever a responsible agent is there to appre- ciate it. Second, that "God created man in His own image" gets recast as the notion that the idea of Hu- manity is an event of cosmic importance because our unprecedented power to reflect Being in knowledge and to recreate nature in our own image is con- strained by the good-in-itself: the uncreated, ethical measure of our cognitive and technical powers. Fi- nally, that "God makes known to man what is good because His word is written in our hearts" gets trans- lated as the idea that the objective imperative of re- sponsibility is answered by our subjective capacity to feel responsible for the totality, continuity, and futu- rity of the object that commands our respect: namely, ourselves as, in Hegelian language, the "coming to itself" of original substance. Jonas's metaphysics provides a wholly naturalistic interpretation of these Judaic ideas based on an in- ternal teleology: the view that nature is purposive even if there is no purposer, that it makes sense to speak of a creative intention in nature without refer- ence to a Creator, and that life is a gift to be received with gratitude even if there is no giver. Though an external teleology-the view that nature is God's creation-may be grafted onto an internal teleology, there is no need to ground metaphysics in theology. Rational metaphysics must stand on its own. If it fails, Jonas contends, theology cannot rescue it from the nihilist's protests. It may be gratifying to those of a religious temper that faith complements Jonas's post- Kantian metaphysic, but theocentric commitments are not necessary to address nihilism and so to meet the emergency of ecological ethics today. A Both/And Ecological Ethic But even if an ecological ethic need not be theo- centric, it is a commonplace among environmental- ists that any ethic adequate to the task of saving our habitat must be nonanthropocentric. We often hear that, by according moral worth only to persons, tra- ditional ethics is anthropocentric and so cannot do justice to our duties to extrahuman nature. If nature has no moral worth for its own sake, then our envi- ronment has value only insofar as it is a means to satisfying our human ends. Environmentalists often decry this instrumental attitude as the philosophical core of our ecological crisis. Two alternatives to anthropocentrism are usually proposed. Some thinkers follow Albert Schweitzer down the path of biotic egalitarianism, claiming that all living beings have equal moral worth. Others- like the American preservationist, John Muir, and more recently "deep ecologists" like Arne Naess- pursue the way of ecocentric holism, asserting that the environment as a whole has intrinsic moral worth independent of its relationship to us. From both per- spectives, Jonas is open to the accusation that his philosophy is too anthropocentric, for he accords us a privileged place in evolution and insists that our primary obligation is to protect the existence and essence of human life. I believe, however, that Jonas's metaphysics un- dercuts the very distinction between anthropocen- trism and nonanthropocentrism. He thinks we can, and indeed must, have it both ways. While living na- ture is a good-in-itself commanding our reverence, and while all organisms participating in this goodness are vulnerable ends-in-themselves who exhibit con- cern for their own being, humans have special dig- nity as moral agents, for our will is responsive to ends beyond our own vital ones. "Only human freedom," Jonas writes, "permits the setting and choosing of ends and thereby the willing inclusion of the ends of others in one's immediate own, to the point of fully and devotedly making them one's own."19 Our first duty is to preserve the noble presence of moral responsibility in nature: of a being who is able to recognize the good-in-itself as such. This does not mean, however, that we must adopt an instrumental stance toward the rest of na- ture, viewing it as a mere means or resource to be mastered for our sake. We must come instead to re- spect ourselves not in virtue of our utter difference from nature, but for "what nature has achieved in us" (p. 129). Our difference in kind is rooted in our continuity with the rest of the biotic community: with others who share in life's goodness, regardless of whether they serve our vital needs. So our self-respect requires "cosmic piety": reverence for the whole of which we are a part. Our obligation to the future of humanity is not based simply on our natural preju- dice toward ourselves, but on an objective "assign- ment" by Being to take care of the delicate web of life that has allowed us to come forth from it. Ac- cording to Jonas, "the threatened plenitude of the living world" issues a "silent plea for sparing its in- tegrity" (p. 8). This claim upon us is "not a mere sentiment which we may indulge as far as we wish or can afford to," but a categorical imperative ema- nating from Being when it is "disclosed to a sight not blocked by selfishness or dimmed by dullness" (p. 90). So there is ultimately no distinction between anthropocentrism and nonanthropocentrism: be- tween self-respect for our unique title as nature's stewards and reverence for "mother nature" who gave birth to us as her guardian. Jonas is not a biotic egalitarian because the amount of moral regard organisms deserve as indi- viduals depends upon the quality of their individual- ity in the psychophysical hierarchy. There is a natural distinction between nutritive and sensitive souls, and among sensitive souls between animals who experi- ence primitive pleasure/pain responses and those who suffer the passions of desire and fear. Finally,</page><page sequence="9">38 I Hastings Center Report, Special Issue, 1995 there are humans: metaphysical and moral beings who can take the interests of others to heart beyond our own vital needs. It is no anthropocentric conceit that our first obligation is toward ourselves, for we are the necessary condition of there being obligation in the world at all. Though we should feel awed by the diverse web of species that let us evolve and sus- tains us, we are often justified in letting our nonvital interests-for example, the desire for cultural institu- tions-override even the vital needs of other organ- isms. There should be no guilt attached to swatting a mosquito. And we do not owe mammals in the wild the sort of protection from suffering that they merit when we have domesticated them. Our pri- mary focus should not be on each and every indi- vidual organism, but, in the words of Aldo Leo- pold, the American advocate of "land ethics," on protecting "the integrity, stability, and beauty" of our environment as a whole. Having rejected biotic egalitarianism, however, Jonas would not join the camp of radical ecocentric holists either, for they contend that nature has moral worth regardless of whether human beings are on the scene. Although Jonas believes that nature carries value independent of us because Being is "for itself" from the inception of life, the moral worth of life only comes into being with the phenomenon of ob- ligation, and obligation requires the evolution of a being capable of moral responsibility. We are "an event for Being" precisely because our arrival marks the transition from vital goodness to moral rightness: from desire to responsibility. It might seem that we would do the greatest justice to the ecosystem as a whole by removing ourselves from it in an act of supreme impartiality so that other species might flourish. But collective suicide would annihilate the phenomena of justice and injustice alike, and so de- prive Being of the metaphysical and moral dimen- sions it took so long to produce. We not only must, but should-out of respect for what nature has achieved in us-appreciate the ecosystem from the perspective of its suitability for our well-being. Pedagogical, Speculative, and Ethical Concerns I have traced Jonas's reply to nihilism through three stages-existential, metaphysical, and theologi- cal-and have argued that his answer to the question "Why should we care about the distant future of hu- mankind and the planet?" does not require an ap- peal to either theology or radical nonanthropocen- trism. At the same time, his answer is far more metaphysically substantial than that of simple anthro- pocentrists who appeal only to our fear for ourselves or disgust at handing a degraded habitat down to our children. The need to move beyond pragmatism to metaphysics arose because a "heuristics of fear" and prudence for our childrens' sake proved inade- quate to the task of grounding a principle of respon- sibility on behalf of the not-yet-existent who have, Jonas contends, no individual rights. But if Occam's razor permits us to answer the nihilist without theo- logical commitments, might we also, in this allegedly postmetaphysical time, meet the emergency of our ecological plight without relying on a metaphysics that is the functional equivalent of theology? I am persuaded by Jonas's extension of existen- tial interpretation to the biological life-world; it helps us to acknowledge the continuity and kinship among life-forms and to appreciate what we lose when we cut ourselves off from them and replace nature with artifice. Even without the metaphysical leap to the idea of nature as a good-in-itself, Jonas's critique of dualism lets us "see" differently, and in such a way that we may be moved to act less violently and in- strumentally. This monistic revisioning of life opens up new existential choices for us. But I wonder whether we need to turn the purposiveness embed- ded in nature into an imperative in order to establish limits. Correlatively, I wonder whether we need such a weighty metaphysics-one which turns the presence of value throughout nature into a command pro- ceeding from Being itself to us-in order to ground our responsibility toward future generations. This worry takes several forms: pedagogical, spec- ulative, and ethical. First, the pedagogical. If a nihil- ist is not moved to appreciate nature by an existential interpretation of the biological facts combined with his own experience of the world around him, I doubt that there is any hope of convincing him by way of the metaphysical claim that we are the self-realization of nature's purposiveness and are called upon to be her guardian (any more than an atheist can really be converted by the ontological proof of God's ex- istence or an immoralist might be shown the errors of his ways by an argument that persons are, after all, ends-in-themselves). It is not clear to me how or whether the metaphysical arguments that Jonas thinks need to be added to his existential interpre- tations improve the possibilities of moral education. I worry that insisting on metaphysical support as be- ing necessary to ground a principle of responsibility may have the negative effect of deflecting attention from the concrete appreciation of nature to abstract argumentation that may be understood only by a few. The response to this point may well be that metaphysical argument is not meant primarily to convert the unconverted but, like Kant's The Foun- dation of the Metaphysics of Morals, to articulate the background assumptions that are necessary to sup- port a feeling of responsibility that many feel pre- reflectively, but run counter to the presuppositions of the offical philosophical culture. This leads to my second, speculative point. Jonas claims that an ethics rooted in metaphysics does not require theology, though his metaphysics remains compatible with the theology laid out in his lecture, "The Concept of God After Auschwitz." But it remains unclear to me what it can mean to speak of human life as "an event for Being" or "an event of cosmic importance" or as being the outcome of "a creative intention" sanction- ing our care without there being a conscious per- spective outside our own for whom our destiny mat- ters. If human life were somehow to be extinguished, would this be a disaster for nature herself? One can hold that it would be a tragedy for us, and that we</page><page sequence="10">The Legacy of HansJonas I 39 ought to do everything we can to avoid it, without assuming that it would be a subversion of nature's final cause or purpose. The death of our star will eventually occur by nature. In the meantime, the bio- sphere itself might be better off without us; certainly many species would. Can we concur with Jonas that "purpose is in general indigenous to nature" (p. 74) without concluding that our way of being purposive is special from a larger perspective than our own? This raises a third, psychological point. One might wonder, along with all advocates of "the her- meneutics of suspicion," whether the insistence that we be subject to an imperative coming from beyond us lest "things fall apart" is not driven by a psycho- logical need to be at the center, linked to eternity, in order to avoid the bitter truth of our contingency. There is no hint of the terror of nature in Jonas's writing. Though he rejects Hegelian dialectic as a way of understanding human history, he finds a kind of reason at work in cosmic history. It is one thing to say that teleology is a more coherent way of under- standing our condition than absurdity. But it is an- other thing to suppose that unless cosmic teleology is true, there are no grounds for substantive respon- sibility. There are many thinkers-I have in mind, for example, the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould-who reject the idea that nature exhibits an overarching purpose but who surely feel that we are lucky to be alive on earth and argue forcefully that we ought to respect the delicate natural environment into which we happen to be thrown. Living within a nature that does not care about us or to which we do not make a difference need not be an abyss so long as we care: perhaps for its sake as well as ours, but not necessarily because we take ourselves to be special from a cosmic point of view. Against Jonas's Kantian account of responsibil- ity-which insists that ethics requires a metaphysical good-in-itself sanctioning obligation beyond the web of our natural sentiments-I can imagine a more Humean story that would build on feelings, like most parents have for their children and like field ecolo- gists often have for the niches they come to know, in order to motivate a desire to care about the future habitability of our planet. An empiricist ethic of this sort does not have the systematic force of Jonas's cos- mic deontology, but it may be more concrete and generally persuasive. Finally, a question about the application of Jonas's primary ethical commandment: the duty to perpetuate the existence and essence of human life. What would it mean to undermine our condition in such a fundamental way that our essence had been violated? How do we draw the line between melior- ism, which seeks to improve our lot without risking our essence, and utopianism, which would wager "the genuine present" for a "new and improved" humankind? When do proposed improvements ex- ceed the legitimate demands of justice, charity, and reason? As ecologist Garrett Hardin points out, "Even if the scenario ending in doom is correct, at every point short of the ultimate step, the techno- logical optimist wins out in competition with the technological pessimist."20 Few would disagree with Jonas's general com- mandment. Instead they would plead innocent to the charge of being utopians and would call themselves meliorists and their critics neo-Luddites. One worries that in spite of Jonas's critique of formalism, his com- mandment remains as formal as Kant's Categorical Imperative, and so just as subject to conflicting con- tents. It would be an unfortunate outcome if the power and glory of Jonas's ontological arguments succeeded in commanding a consensus, while con- cealing deep disagreements over the fundamental ex- istential and policy choices we face as we approach the twenty-first century. Even if we need an ontologi- cal grounding of ethics, there is no shortcut around paying the closest attention to the ontic domain in which real conflicts persist, for this is where each of us will figure out what it means to live like a good Jonasian today.
