<plain_text><page sequence="1">"IS THERE 'KNOWLEDGE' OF GOD?" FRANK B. DILLEY* THIS article is about one funda- mental question: Is conceptual knowledge of God possible within a philosophy or theology? Another way of putting the question is this: Is con- ceptual knowledge of God's nature pos- sible? The discussion is occasioned by two articles which appeared in this Journal in recent years, setting forth radically opposed positions on this vital question. I refer to E. LaB. Cherbon- nier's "The Theology of the Word of God" (1953, pp. 16-29) and Maurice Friedman's "Symbol, Myth, and His- tory in the Thought of Martin Buber" (January, 1954). I have included a third position, that of Paul Tillich, to extend the possibilities and to set forth the issues better.' It is the strange nature of the case that any two of these thinkers would mutually reject the third on crucial is- sues. Briefly summarized, both Tillich and Cherbonnier would regard Buber's position as embodying a "bad" meta- physics, in that Buber "refuses" to dis- cuss questions of God's nature, thus un- duly limiting metaphysics. Buber and Tillich would reject Cherbonnier's doc- trine of the nature of God, holding that Cherbonnier reduces God to a being less than he is and is not really talking about God but an idol. Cherbonnier and Buber would reject Tillich's position on the grounds that God is not Being itself, as Tillich conceives him to be, God is someone else altogether, a living God who relates himself to man. There are great similarities among these three thinkers. All three believe that they are expressing true religious experience, that experience which has been at the heart of the Judeo-Christian tradition. All three are equally sure that the others have distorted that genuine experience. All three believe that God, man, and the world are all real and that they are in some sense separate, hence all three stand against any world-dis- solving pantheism or God-dissolving im- manentism. All three are vitally con- cerned with the relationship which ex- ists between God, man, and the world and hold that this relationship is the vital one for man. There are several possible ways to characterize briefly the differences be- tween the three thinkers under discus- sion. One is to examine their ideas con- cerning the relationship between man and God. There are at least three possi- ble positions which have been taken at one time or another: that God and man are identical; that God and man are completely separate metaphysically; that God and man are ontologically re- lated. The first of these positions is what Huxley defends as the "Perennial Phi- losophy," resting on the seemingly ab- surd notion that ultimately there is no * Frank Dilley is an instructor of religion at Smith College.

The second position is held by Cher- bonnier and by Buber and, in a sense, by Tillich. Man has freedom to stand over against God; man and God are in some sense separate. The third posi- tion is Tillich's: God is the ontological ground of man in so far as man is de- pendent ontologically upon God. Buber and Cherbonnier can thus speak quite literally about creation, while Tillich can use the word only in the carefully quali- fied sense of ontological dependence. The problem can also be approached via their respective descriptions of the nature of God and of man. For Tillich, God is Being itself. Man has a deriva- tive status, participating in being but with a heritage of the non-being from which he came and to which he will re- turn. God is infinite; man, owing to non- being, is finite. God has absolute free- dom; man has finite freedom. Buber maintains a sharply opposed position. God cannot be described at all except to say that God is the Thou who can never become an It, and even this statement is not properly a description of God. Whereas Tillich maintains that much can be known about God by proceeding ontologically from the nature of man and the world, Buber argues that nothing about God can be known, not even sym- bolically. God's relation to man may be discovered but not his nature. Cherbon- nier takes a third position, that concep- tual knowledge of God can be had in a literal sense. God and man are both per- sons, both centers of will and freedom. God's nature can be discovered from what he does and says. But these classifications do not help much in discovering the positions which these men hold. To categorize these men so simply is perhaps to distort more than to display, and it is only after more care- ful examination of their positions that these categories can be used meaning- fully. PAUL TILLICH For Tillich, God is "being-itself,"2 the "ground of being."3 He is the ground of everything and every quality that is. All the structures of existence point on- tologically to God. The nerve of this position is stated quite explicitly: "The ontological argument relies on the sound principle of the identity of Being and thinking which all thinking presup- poses."4 God is the ground of everything that is; therefore, everything that is pre- supposes him. Thus Tillich can main- tain that the attempt to deny God im- plies him, since such an attempt implies truth and therefore implies God, who is the ontological presupposition of all truth.5 However, it is a mistake, according to Tillich, to say that God is. "Is" usu- ally connotes existence, and God does not, strictly speaking, exist. He is the ground of all existence, but he is not. To say "God exists" implies that God is a concrete, individual object and further implies that God is a being and not Be- ing. God cannot be a concrete object be- cause he is the Ground of all objects, of all being.6 "The being of God cannot be understood as the existence of a being alongside others or above others. If God is a being, he is subject to the categories of finitude, especially to space and sub- stance."' The logic is this: "If God is not being-itself, he is subordinate to it"8 and therefore is less than God. It is of great help in understanding Tillich to note that he uses the phrase the "God beyond God" as an indication of what he means by the word "God." By the use of such phrases he serves notice that</page><page sequence="3">118 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION he is not speaking of the God of person- alistic theism. Nothing can literally be said of God except that he is Being-itself. "However, after this has been said, nothing else can be said about God as God which is not symbolic."' The reason given is this: "There can be no doubt that any con- crete assertion about God must be sym- bolic, for a concrete assertion is one which uses a segment of finite experi- ence in order to say something about him."'1 yet it can say something because it is grounded in being-itself, the infinite. One such symbolic statement is that God can be described as "the highest being in which everything that we have does exist in the most perfect way."" Here is an example of the ontological method at work: Things about us seem to be real: Everything we encounter appears to us as real, as true being. But we soon notice that its reality is only transitory. It was, but now it is no more. Nonbeing has swallowed it, so to speak.... Or we notice that it is different from what it seemed to be, and we distinguish be- tween its surface and its deeper, more real levels. But soon these also prove to be surface, and we try to penetrate into still deeper levels, toward the ultimate reality of a thing. No thing, however, is isolated from all other things. And, the deeper the levels into which we enter, the less possible it is to consider them in separation from each other and from the whole of reality. In the ordinary encounter of man with man, each appears as an isolated individual. Yet, if we enter the levels of personal existence which have been rediscovered by depth psychology, we encounter the past, the ancestors, the collective unconscious, the living substance in which all living beings participate.12 Apparently, individuality is only a sur- face phenomenon, and one must pene- trate far beneath individuality to come to that which has reality. The figure of an inverted pyramid suggests itself, with individuality at the bottom, and collec- tivity then being itself as the higher levels of reality. We must go "back" from personality in order to discover being. In discussing various types of philos- ophy of religion, Tillich explicates his position in some detail."3 He identifies himself with the ontological position. In the ontological way, man "discovers himself when he discovers God; he dis- covers something that is identical with himself although it transcends him infi- nitely." Tillich defines the ontological position as "the experience of the iden- tity of subject and object in relation to Being itself," and he quotes with ap- proval Eckart's statement that "there is between God and the soul neither strangeness nor remoteness, therefore the soul is not only equal with God but it is-the same that He is." Man has immediate knowledge of God. Further- more, "perceiving and accepting the eternal truth are identical." The ques- tion arises as to how any dissolution of this state could be possible. If accept- ance and perception of the eternal truth are identical, then how can rejection of the eternal truth occur, and how can es- trangement come about? There is a dis- tinct possibility that Tillich means to imply that estrangement came to be at the time of creation and that creation came about as a necessary result of God's nature, for "the divine life is es- sentially creative.""4 Creation implies separation, estrangement, or fall. "Fully developed creatureliness is fallen crea- tureliness.... Seen from one side this is the end of creation. Seen from the other side, it is the begining of the fall.""' This seems to imply a clear-cut case of cre- ation equals fall; Tillich seems to be saying that to be a fully developed crea- ture is to be a fallen creature; but he elsewhere denies that he identifies cre-</page><page sequence="4">"IS THERE 'KNOWLEDGE' OF GOD?" 119 ation and fall, saying that "I do not identify finitude and evil, explicitly or implicitly."'6 Before launching into a critique of his position from another point of view, let me mention two points at which issue can be taken. In the first place, one could conceivably agree with Tillich that the real must be rational in order for man to know the real rationally, but this does not require that one conceive reality in the particular kind of rational terms which Tillich uses, that is, one can be a nominalist and still believe that the world is rational." In the second place, there is an obviously crucial ques- tion whether or not there is such a thing as Being or whether, rather, there are only beings. The argument used previ- ously that, if God is not being-itself, he is subordinate to it has validity only if there is such a thing as being-itself, and it is not necessarily evident that there is. One commonly recurring objection to Tillich's philosophy of religion is that he allows religion to be swallowed up into ontology. Cherbonniers8 furnishes an excellent summary of some of the divergences. The pillar of the biblical position is that men and God are defi- nitely related, while, for Tillich, God is not, strictly speaking, related to any- thing. "God as being itself is the ground of every relation; in his life all relations are present . . . but they are not the re- lations of God with something else."''9 Biblically speaking, God is one who acts, who wills, who loves, who responds. For Tillich, "a conditioned God is no God."20 For Tillich, God creates necessarily, and Tillich explicitly rejects both Calvin's claim that God created with a purpose, that he be glorified, and Luther's argu- ment that God created in order to have a communion of love with his creatures. "Here again the implication is that God needs something he could not have with- out creation."2' Biblically speaking, God lives and acts; for Tillich, these are only symbolic words for God. It is a blas- phemy to say that God lives and to mean it literally. Biblically speaking, God is related to man, and the relationships which hold require plurality. Love pre- supposes and maintains metaphysical plurality, while it produces a unity of purpose. For Tillich, love is unitive.22 Biblically speaking, knowledge of God comes to us from God himself or from his agents. The acts of God and the words of the interpreters of these acts convey knowledge of God to his people. For Tillich, knowledge of God arises be- cause all finite things participate in Be- ing and can show forth this participation. CHERBONNIER'S BIBLICAL METAPHYSIC Cherbonnier's avowed attempt is to wed the method of Athens (philosophy) with the content of Jerusalem. This would involve the theologian's accept- ing the contributions of the Greek philo- sophical method to human thought: clar- ity, coherence, and consistency. He points out that nothing involving content is conceded to Greece, for all these rules of thought are purely formal, they refer to the manner of thinking. One must think clearly, coherently, systematical- ly.23 If philosophy is only a method, there must be a content for philosophy to work on. It is Cherbonnier's claim that only the content of Jerusalem, the biblical content, when tested by the method of Athens, is found to be satis- factory. Other contents either prove to be unclear or incoherent or inconsistent. The failure of many of these contents is exhibited by their inability to include the existence of the philosopher as a free agent, when this is the presupposition of the whole philosophical quest. His hope</page><page sequence="5">120 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION is to provide a position which is philo- sophically sound, yet avoids swallow- ing up the biblical proclamation into ontology. The biblical content does include free agents. The Bible presents free agents, in negative or positive relation to God and their fellows, acting, thinking, being acted upon. The key biblical concepts are sin, grace, responsibility, love, re- demption, justice, forgiveness, right- eousness-all of which speak of actions, involve relationships between persons. From the creation story to the messianic fulfilment the portrayal of free agents is painted. God creates men in his own image, free to rebel. They do rebel, and the story is then of God's revealing him- self to men in the attempt to win them back. Dr. Cherbonnier acknowledges that there is no metaphysics as such stated in the biblical literature, but, he argues, nevertheless there is a meataphysics im- plicit in its stories, a metaphysics which has as its central tenet the freedom of God and men. Since freedom is the defining charac- teristic, it is required that will, not rea- son, be of the prime importance. The important types of relationship in such a metaphysics are acts, not thoughts. Right acting is more important than right thinking; in fact, thinking itself is an act of will. One can facilitate think- ing or cease thinking by acts of will, by choosing to think or by paralyzing think- ing through the use of drugs, etc. The key terms in such a philosophy are terms such as "love," "faith"-relatedness- words, not knowledge-words. Knowl- edge about what is real comes a posteri- ori, not a priori. This follows from the fact that what is real is free agents and their acts. A free act cannot be deduced before it happens. One can only look to see whether it has happened. This dis- cussion could not be deduced, but, once it is written, it can be read, a posteriori, and only thus can it be known to exist. It further follows that particulars, not universals, are the most real. Reality is concrete existing individuals and the things which they do and make. Univer- sals are class names, descriptions of par- ticular acts. Thus it is proper to speak not of "freedom" but of "free agents," "free acts." Universals are shorthand, used by man to order his world, not pre- existent realities. The importance of this is attested to by Buber in strong lan- guage: "The scholastic dispute over the reality or unreality of universals, was in essence a philosophical struggle between religion and philosophy and that is its lasting significance."24 Religion concerns not universals but particulars. God, too, is a free agent. The biblical tradition pictures God as such. He loves, acts, speaks, and all these are acts of a free agent. He is a God who wills. He wills to create, he wills that men should relate themselves to him freely and that men should relate themselves truly to their brothers. The God of the Bible is anthropomorphic, he looks and hears, listens and speaks. He causes things to come about, he creates and destroys. One cannot establish a priori that such a God exists. One can only say that if there is a God, then he must be free, then one must look, a posteriori, to see if there is such a God. To find out whether a person exists or what a person is like, one is dependent upon "knowl- edge by acquaintance.""25 In other words, knowledge of this sort is derivative upon revelation, upon the revelation of person to person.26 Knowledge of God is dependent upon right will. To those who are rightly related, events reveal God. Thus God's nature is not deduced</page><page sequence="6">"IS THERE 'KNOWLEDGE' OF GOD?" 121 but discovered, it is revealed by God himself. Cherbonnier thus could not say that everything is a fitting symbol for God. It depends on whether or not God has manifested himself in this event. Cher- bonnier cannot say with Tillich that there is "no difference between a stone and a person in their potentiality of be- coming bearers of revelation,""27 because God, being personal, can reveal himself adequately and fully only in a person. One further consequence should be mentioned. In such a view plurality is not limiting but fulfilling. One condition for relation is multiplicity. Plurality is good and necesary. Freedom is some- thing to be preserved, not something to be avoided in some quest for metaphysi- cal unity. MARTIN BUBER According to Buber, there are two types or ways of relating one's self to others. One way in which a man can be related to something is the I-It way, used in science, philosophy, mathemat- ics, and many other activities. This type of relation permits the knowledge of or- dering and controlling, knowledge which treats things and persons as objects for the purpose of better organization and control. It permits the knowledge of ob- servation, of measurement, of detach- ment. But there is another type of rela- tionship which one may have with an- other, involving not just the mind and the senses but the whole self. There is no "object" in the I-It sense in this type of relation. Something addresses one. There is real reciprocal movement to- ward each other. There is real meeting. Nothing "objective" transpires in an I- Thou encounter; no "knowledge" is de- rived; but there is meeting, of I with Thou, of person with person. There is no object; nothing to control; no think- ing about, only direct meeting, a turning toward, an addressing. Whenever this Thou becomes an It, the I-Thou rela- tion has been broken. Both I-Thou and I-It forms of relation are legitimate, necessary, and good. It is only when an I-It relation becomes autonomous and replaces the I-Thou relation that evil results. I-It knowledge must be kept within its sphere and must not be al- lowed to prevent the return to I-Thou. Man's relationship to God is an I- Thou relationship. God is the Eternal Thou, the Thou who can never become an It. In an I-Thou relation no objective knowledge is communicated, no knowl- edge of attributes or nature is revealed. There is only the I and the Thou, face to face. "Man receives, and he receives not a specific 'content' but a Presence, a Presence as power." In speaking of such an encounter Buber says further: "We acquire no knowledge from it"; "the Word of revelation is I am that I am. That which reveals is that which reveals. That which is is and nothing more." In short, God is the Being "that may prop- erly only be addressed, not expressed."28 To speak of God as Tillich does and as Cherbonnier does is theoretically quite impossible for Buber. Nothing about God can be said. Any saying about is I-It in structure. To speak of God means to get outside God and man, to take an objective position outside the I-Thou relation, to limit both God and man to some conceptual status and talk about them. When man does this, he has left all I-Thou behind. Buber goes on to say that when man does this, he is speak- ing no longer about God. I-It termin- ology can be used, but only to point back to the nature of the I-Thou relation and not to the nature of the beings related. I-It symbols can be used to communi-</page><page sequence="7">122 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION cate about this relation and can be used to point to the relation but not to de- scribe the related parties. The way of philosophy is the I-It way. It makes God an object of thought, not a living Thou which confronts man. Thus a philosophy which includes God is not possible and is supremely danger- ous because I-It forms eclipse God, blot him from sight, and prevent return to him, if one thinks that the I-It terms describe God. In passing, it might be well to men- tion here the notion of symbolism which follows from this position. Whereas Til- lich held that God could be spoken about, known at least symbolically by proceeding ontologically from the struc- tures of existence, and whereas Cherbon- nier argued that God's nature could be known, Buber holds that no symbols about God are possible. Any religious symbols refer solely to the relation be- tween God and man. God in himself can only be addressed, not expressed. Fried- man points out29 that all that can be stated are symbols of the relation which holds between man and God, symbols which point to that kind of relation. When Buber calls God the "Eternal Thou," he means only that God is eter- nally a Thou as we are related to him, not that God is, in nature, a Thou. Fur- thermore, a symbol does not participate in God but points to a relation. Its mean- ing is found precisely in its pointing to a concrete situation, a concrete I-Thou relation. To abstract the symbol from the encounter is to change it, to lose it. Man does not know God as he is in himself. It becomes increasingly evident that, for Buber, any philosophy which thinks that it speaks about God at all is mis- taken and, worse than that, idolatrous, for what it is speaking about when it thinks that it is speaking about God is something else. Cherbonnier tries to escape the im- pact of Buber's critique by avoiding making God into an ontological object. God is a Person, not a logical absolute or an ontological presupposition. God cannot be discovered rationally or (be proceeded to) ontologically: he can only be discovered in an I-Thou relation. CHERBONNIER VERSUS BUBER Cherbonnier has charged,30 and Fried- man has emphatically denied,"3 that Bu- ber capitulates to the Barthian (and also Tillichian) conception of God as the Unconditioned. A close perusal of Bu- ber's writings seems to indicate some ground for confusion. We have presented support for Friedman's position; now let us look to see whether there is an- other side. Cherbonnier points out, to support his claim, that Buber uses the words "Absolute" and "Eternal" for God. This has already been dealt with; we have seen that Buber's claim is that such words speak only of the relation between man and God and not of God. Yet Buber elsewhere seems to speak quite differently, giving some ground for Cherbonnier's contention. Buber speaks of "the limitless original Godhead" and of "the God Who has not entered the world, the Unlimited, the bearer of limit- less light, the Godhead, the pure Being, Who is at work," and goes on to describe this God as working "as a person." Again, "it is at one and the same time the complete unity and the limitless per- son . . . 'Esse est Deus' says Eckhart, and that can also be said here, but here Being includes Person . . . in the paradoxical sense, the limitless, the Ab- solute person." Buber speaks of "an ab- solute person, faced by nothing" who becomes "one faced by a recipient."32</page><page sequence="8">"IS THERE 'KNOWLEDGE' OF GOD?" 123 This latter statement is of crucial im- portance, for Buber is seen to have a concept of God as person even when he is as yet unrelated, before creation, making Buber also fall under Fried- man's strictures by also misconceiving, as Cherbonnier is charged with miscon- ceiving, personality "as an objective description of a being taken for himself rather than as something that only ex- ists in relation.""33 Buber seems to see what Cherbonnier also sees, that some structure of personality exists before creation and persists between moments of relation, that is, that God can be spoken of as a Person apart from a con- crete I-Thou relation. This is apart from the consideration that only a Per- son can choose to become related, so that if God wills to come into relation, he must be a Person. Buber further says about God: The Godhead as a perfect unity, God before and after creation, is at the same time the ruling God. For even He is the kind One, Who created the world to actualise His kindness; He is the great lover, Who has placed man in the world that He might be able to love him,- but there is no perfect love without reciproci- ty, and He, the original God, longs thereafter that man should love Him.34 Elsewhere, "The Eternal Thou can by its nature not become It: for by its na- ture it cannot be established in measure and bounds,""3 and Buber speaks of "the existence of a Being who, though in Himself unlimited and unconditioned, lets other beings, limited and condi- tioned indeed exist outside Himself."36 For one for whom any knowledge of God as he is in himself is impossible, Buber is able to say much about his nature. He is limitless, pure Being, the absolute person, perfect unity, the ruling God, the Kind One, the great lover who longs that men should love him, who cannot be established in measure and bounds by his nature, who is uncondi- tioned. Two alternatives have seemingly been stated by Buber. One is that no knowledge of God is possible, the other is that knowledge of God is possible. The latter alternative shows two kinds of terms, one kind appropriate to the Absolute, Being-itself, the other appro- priate to personality. He seems to side with Tillich, on the one hand, and Cher- bonnier, on the other, while claiming to be on neither side. The hypothesis offered is that Buber gets into this contradiction because of a misconception on his own part, a mis- conception which, when cleared away, frees his philosophy from its major dif- ficulty. Because Buber excludes God from metaphysical consideration at the front door, he unwittingly allows an in- adequate metaphysical conception to enter the back door, and he has thrown away his weapons. Buber rightly does not want to make God into an object which can be discovered and manipu- lated by man's reason. Such a God would be less than God; in this Buber, Tillich, and Cherbonnier agree. Their differences arise partly out of the way in which they go about protecting against such a misconception. Tillich does this by denying that God is a being at all, thus asserting that he can never be made into an object. Buber denies that God can be an object by removing God from the whole area of knowledge. Cherbonnier tries to protect against such a misconception by maintaining that God can best be conceived as a Per- son and thus as not subject to "objecti- fication" in knowledge. A distinction should be made, as Bu- ber so clearly makes it, between two kinds of relation, I-Thou and I-It. It</page><page sequence="9">124 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION should be acknowledged that I-It knowl- edge of a person, gained by disinterested observation and manipulation, is dif- ferent from knowledge derived from an encounter. But this does not compel one to say, as Buber does say, that there is no such thing as I-Thou knowledge of God's nature. I would want to defend the proposition that there is such a thing as I-Thou knowledge, that when a stranger takes one in and cares for him in a kind way, then one knows, existen- tially, that that person is a kind person. One has I-Thou knowledge of that per- son as kind. Buber can speak of a God who longs that men should love him; this is knowledge in a real sense, and it is derived by relation and not from ab- stract meditation. I can know another person intimately without possessing him, without making him into an object, leaving him still over against me, never coming within my possession. He is simply there in his totality; yet he is known for who he is, for what he is. One could deduce that if there is a God, he must be loving, but one would not really know, existentially, that God loves un- less one met God. Buber is correct if he means that to know God only concep- tually is not to know him. One must know him by acquaintance, by meeting him. What I am saying is that there are two kinds of knowledge as well as two kinds of relationship, and it is a danger- ous distortion to confine knowledge to only one of the two spheres. To identify the knowledge of God with I-It knowl- edge is to deny the validity of the distinc- tion between the two kinds of relation. I would like to examine briefly one furthur statement of Buber's in order to introduce one last crucial point in this three-cornered debate. Buber says that, in making personal statements about God, "we are making no statement about the Absolute which reduces it to the personal."" I call attention to the words "the Absolute," seemingly a des- cription of God, and "reduces." It is the latter word which I wish to examine. If our previous analysis of Buber's thought is correct, then it is meaningful for him to speak of reduction; that is, if we con- clude that Buber thinks of God as the Unconditioned, then we can give mean- ing to the above statement. Buber seems, questionably in my opinion, to think that the category of personal is less than the highest category and therefore that to speak of God as "person" is to "re- duce" his stature. This would fit in well with the mystical side of his philosophy. The issue is whether or not there is anything more than or higher than per- sonal, more than or higher than free. Buber, at least in the above quotation, would agree with Tillich that there is something higher; Cherbonnier would deny it. Historically, many attempts to describe a more-than-personal being end by using terms which are descrip- tive of the less-than-personal, even by using terms apropriate to non-being or the lowest levels of being. We have seen, in discussing Tillich, that this is done, for we proceed from personality down- ward, through collectivity and life, to get at the real. Other writers have de- scribed God as purposeless, beyond good and evil, moving by conformity with his nature, creating by necessity. All these descriptions deny that God is free in the sense in which we know freedom, that is, he has no live options but can only be determined by his nature. It seems to me--though this will not settle the argu- ment-that to say the above things is to say that the Absolute is determined, is less than free. Such considerations lead me to conclude that freedom lies at the top of the scale. What does it mean</page><page sequence="10">"IS THERE 'KNOWLEDGE' OF GOD?" 125 to be more than red? Or more than alive? Here again we have reached tops of scales. If God is best described mystically and/or ontologically, then freedom is a "reduction." From the ontological stand- point, freedom is dangerous because it makes disruption possible and because freedom is possible only as a result of separation and is to be avoided, to be left behind as one seeks to re-merge himself with the divine. To be free is to be less than self-sufficient if one means by "self-sufficiency" absence of relation. But is does not seem to me that Buber would want to be forced into this po- sition, at least I would assume that he does not from the emphasis which he puts upon relation and freedom. One must take his stand either for or against freedom and relation; and if one thinks that freedom and relation are good, then it seems to me that one must support the idea of a personal God. Buber himself seems to draw what I would see to be the proper implications of the I-Thou relation. He describes, as has been stated God as loving, as kind, as becoming a person in order to relate himself to man. These are all terms ap- propriate to personality. Furthermore, Buber describes lives lived in relation as "symbolic existence." He speaks of "be- ing a symbol." Friedman states that "the highest manifestation of the sym- bol is, in fact, a human life lived in re- lation to the Absolute.""38 This seems to suggest that the personal realm is the source of the most fitting symbols for God, again pointing to a personal nature. This much at least seems to be clear, Buber denies all possibility of knowl- edge of God's nature, yet at the same time makes statements about God's na- ture, thus illustrating what Cherbonnier and Tillich would both maintain, that one cannot help but have a conception of God in his philosophy. The choice is between having an explicit or an unex- amined philosophy, and Buber falls in- to contradiction because he refuses to be philosophical at this level. In this re- spect Cherbonnier's criticism of him seems to be valid. SUMMARY OF ISSUES 1. Tillich maintains, against Cher- bonnier, that to make God a being be- side other beings is to make him into an idol. Such a being is less than God, and to give one's allegiance to him is to wor- ship an idol. Cherbonnier's reply is that this is not the case; rather, to deny that God is actually personal, to maintain that God is the philosophical Absolute, is to "logicomophize" him, is to limit him to less than he is-in short, is to be idolatrous. 2. Tillich is attacked by both Buber and Cherbonnier, by Buber because he converts God into an It, by Cherbonnier because he swallows up the biblical God into Being-itself. Tillich, however, main- tains that his position is the only sound one, persupposed by all thought and by all being. 3. Tillich and Cherbonnier would both argue, against Buber, that to ex- clude God from philosophy is extremely dangerous. Both agree that one must have a metaphysical description of God in one's philosophy. Buber's reply is that God cannot be spoken of in philoso- phy and that if one thinks that he is speaking about God, he is in error, in serious error. One has eclipsed God, broken relation with him, if one thinks that he is describing him. 4. Cherbonnier argues, against Bu- ber, that Buber has unwittingly placed himself in the mystic's camp, that Buber ultimately has a metaphysical</page><page sequence="11">126 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION conception of God which is incompati- ble with the biblical tradition, with phi- losophy, and with the heart of Buber's own thought. 5. Buber would maintain that Cher- bonnier has unwittingly placed himself in Tillich's camp by treating God in an I-It fashion. To speak of God as a per- son, a being, is to treat him in I-It terms, and this to capitulate to philosophy. Cherbonnier disagrees, maintaining that God has revealed to man his nature as well as his will. To deny this is to deny God's word about himself. Further he argues that I-Thou knowledge is pos- sible and that this kind of knowledge avoids the strictures which cause Buber to reject knowledge of God. NOTES 1. I have had the good fortune to have worked with all three men in recent years. Friedman and Cherbonnier have both read an earlier version of of this article and agree that the issues are clearly set up, and I have profited greatly from critiques which both have given. Friedman does not agree with my conclusions. 2. Tillich, Systematic Theology (Chicago: Uni- versity of Chicago Press, 1951), I, 205. 3. Ibid., p. 238. 4.
