[A systematic and successful attempt to isolate the memory image, to compare it qualita- tively with the sense-complex from which it derives, and to estimate the extrinsic and intrinsic factors tending to modify its original quality. (1) Memory of so simple a thing as a coloured or grey disc may be mediated by a colour or brightness image, by names (verbal descriptions or as- sociates), by affective processes (felt organic sensations), or by strain sensations in the head and about the trunk. (2) Greys and colours exposed in daylight tend (if the subject is at all visual in type) to lighten in visual memory. (3) Greys shown in the dark tend to darken in visual memory during an unilluminated interval. These two facts show the importance of peripheral influences on memory, and suggest that it is often only by a combination of various memorial resources that retention is made definite and exact: (4) Qualitative fidelity shows no constant change from 2 to 6 seconds after the cessation of stimulus; it loses in accuracy from 10 to 60 seconds, the direction of change being constant. Above, 1 minute to 5 minutes, the inaccuracy increases. On the other hand, the image is more readily producible after 5 than it is after 1 minute. (5) Images are available in the great majority of cases of brightness and colour memory.

REVUE NPO-SCOLASTIQUE. No. 23. According to D. Nys ('iEtude sur l'Espace '), the internal space occupied by a body is, from the ontological point of view, identical with concrete extension, and thus its essential functions are to extend the material mass, to limit its volume, and to attach it in an exclusive manner to .a definite place. On internal place, as on their foundation, are based all those relations of distance which, in their aggregate, constitute real space. P. de Munnynck (' L'Hypothese</page><page sequence="6">428 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. scientifique') agrees with Ostwald in holding that a causal hypothesis is never proved in the proper sense of the word. Such an hypothesis is neither true nor false. It is simply good or bad, useful or harmful, according to circumnstances. St. Thomas would seem to have been of this opinion, for in the commentary on Aristotle's treatise De Caelo et Mundo he says: " The suppositions of astronomers are not necessarily true. Nor are they to be regarded as necessarily true even when they explain the facts of observation, for it may very well be that at some future time an explanation equally satisfactory, though as yet quite un- discovered, may present itself". G. de Craene ('La Connaissance de l'esprit') maintains that though, by llmeans of that faculty of abstraction which enables us to apprehend the essence or nature of bodies apart from the notes which characterise it in individual bodies, we may, up to a certain poinit, place ourselves in relation with things immaterial, never- theless it remains always true that material things constitute the proper object of human thought. From this it follows that our idea of spirit or immaterial substance is a purely negative idea. N. Kaufmann ('La Finalite dans l'Ordre moral'), following Aristotle and St. Thomas, argues (1) that the perfection of the rational nature of man is the iimanent end of moral activity; (2) that the rational nature of man is the norm and law of moral activity. Reason recognises the nature of man in all its relations, and, when it is sound (X6yov op0o6), it decides rightly as to what is in harmony with that nature, and thus constitutes the norm of conduct; (3) that the rational nature of man is the basis of virtue, and, since it tends towards its own perfection as its end, the principle of finality. No. 24. P. de Munnynck ('L'Hypothese scientifique,' suite et fin) who, in a previous number of the Revue, had contended that hypotheses are not true in the proper sense of the word, inasmuch as they have no rigorously logical connexion with fact, now upholds the usefulness of these hypotheses. From the psychological standpoint, their usefulness is great since they gratify the natural instinct of the reason to seek for causes, an instinct which had been artificially repressed during the processes of mere observation. But, besides this subjective, they have also, as is obvious, an objective value, seeing that they contribute largely to the progressive conquest of the secrets of nature. For their objective usefulness it is necessary however that they should be simple, representative, i.e., that they should appeal to the imagination, comprehensive and free froin opposition to any established fact. N. Kaufmann ('La Finalite dans l'Ordre moral') continuing his studies of finality in the moral order, as set forth in the writings of Aristotle and St. Thoimias, llmaintains that in the moral perfection of human lnature there are three degrees, and, corresponding with these three degrees, three tendencies of human nature. (1) The individual man possesses, by virtue of his nature, a certain fundamental perfection which nature strongly urges him to preserve and develop. But (2) man in isolation cannot fully realise the imperative necessities of his nature. He needs for their fulfilment the aid of human society by means of family ties, association with those of his kind, and relation to the State which is the most perfect of societies. To this need corresponds the social tendency. But (3) the greatest perfection of man's is the beatitude which results from union with God, and to this alone man's nature tends not as to a means, but as to its ultimate end. D. Mercier (' La Notion de la Verite') accepts the traditional definition of logical truth, viz., the "agreemiient of thought with reality " but insists that " thought " in this connexion primarily stands for judgment, while " reality " primarily stands for the objective identity of the two terms of the judgment, and</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 429 only secondarily for the objective reality of each of the two terms. E. van Rocy (' Le Kantisme et la Theologie Protestante') in an article that is too brief to be an adequate treatment of its subject, maintains that Kant has formulated in their extreme consequences the principles of Protestantism. ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHOLOGIE UND PHYSIOLOGIE DER SINNESORGANE. 1Bd. xxii., Heft 3. M. Ettlinger. 'Zur Grundlegung einer AEsthetik des Rhythmus.' [We may approach the study of rhythm formally, asking bow rhythmical art-forms are constituted; or we may approach it psychologically. The latter is the correct way. For there are no pure rhythmical art-forms; rhythms have to be 'given' by some one, and there is no instrument for their measurement; and the reduc- tion of rhythm to time and intensity is unsatisfactory. (1) Subjective rhythmisation. The series of sounds is not an objective unity: sensa- tion alternates with 'empty' times. Critique of Wundt's theory of tense and relaxed expectation. What we actually have is a continuous, pleasant feeling of activity or tension, varying only in concentration. It is an objectified feeling, i.e., a feeling of esthetic sympathy. The peculiarity of the rhythmical structure is the recurrence of groups within a whole-not the repetition of simple impressions. As the strokes come, we have two rival tendencies-the one holding us back, the other pointing us forwards. The rhythmically minded hearer escapes the dilemma by putting life and effort into the series; there is a movement onward, not a mere temporal sum of separates. 'Inner accentuation' shows the action of the secondary, inhibitive tendency; the unaccented termns show the primary movement. The latter is what carries the feeling. Cf., Lipps' theory of the geometrical optical illusions. (2) The objective causes of rhythm. These are intensive relations; the duration of the sensations; the mode of their succession. A fourth factor, qualitative difference of sensations, is of great importance only in music. The various causes may function vicariously, though they have not the same value for rhythmisation. (3) Analysis of the rhythmical art-forms and explanation of their pleasingness. The equipollence of rhythmical groups lies in the fact that in all alike there is ac- complished a complementary suppression and restoration, no mnatter what the nunmber of terms, time, intensity differences, etc., may be.] Besprechungen.

Teichmiiller distinguishes two kinds of being: (1) Ideal being, which is represented by the copula " is " and answers the question "what? " This ideal being has no temporal implications. (2) Real being, which is represented by the conjunction "that" and by the existential use of the verb " to be ". Temporal distinctions as expressed by grammatical tenses belong only to real being. Ideal being belongs to the object of consciousness as such. Real being belongs to psychical activities or processes. To complete the account of being we must consider the union of ideal and' real being in conscious life. They are embraced and combined by the " ego ". To the ego, as such, belongs a third type of being, which is presupposed in ideal and real being. This is called by Teichmiiller " substantial being ". The article proceeds to give an interesting account of the way in which the "ego " comes to the knowledge of "substantial beings" other than itself.] L. Goldschmidt.

Account of the formation of geometrical concepts by the idealising of perceptual experience. In the idealising process a decision is made between alternatives which perceptual experience leaves open because- it is not exact enough to select one rather than another. The alterna- tives selected by the Euclidean Geometry are the most simple and con- venient. But others are possible. The space in which physical process takes place may belong to a non-Euclidean type. All that experience shows is that within the limits of observation it cannot be distinguished from Euclidean space.
