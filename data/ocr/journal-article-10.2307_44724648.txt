Viano Biomedical Science Department General Motors Research Laboratories Warren, Ml ABSTRACT The study was directed toward improving our understanding how postcrash column com- pression and steering wheel deformation relate to the driver interaction with an energy absorbing steering system during auto- motive collisions. Frontal sled tests con- ducted at 19-37 km/h investigated the Part 572 antropomorphic dummy interaction with a ball-sleeve column steering assembly over a range of column angles and surrogate postures. Neither column compression nor steering wheel deformation correlated with the mechanical severity of the test surrogate interaction with the steering system. The steering wheel deformed before the column compressed and the degree of wheel deforma- tion strongly depended on the surrogate load distribution, the steering wheel being an important energy absorbing element. Analysis of 154 frontal towaway accidents involving GM cars further confirmed that although steering wheel deformation and column compression may be indicative of occupant loading, they do not necessarily indicate the severity of the driver interaction with the steering system. SEVERAL STUDIES COMPARED INJURY FREQUENCY in automotive accidents between vehicles hav- ing an energy absorbing steering system and vehicles without energy absorbing steering systems and concluded that energy absorbing steering systems have improved the protection of the driver in frontal collisions [1,2,3].* Some studies have emphasized the levels of postcrash column compression and deformation of the steering wheel as significant indi- cators of the energy absorbing column perfor- mance. Several investigators have used solely the deformation modes to assess the compression performance of the column [1,4]. They found less column compression than they had expected and concluded that the energy absorption may be compromised in specific situations. Our study was directed towards improving the understanding how the level of steering wheel deformation and column com- pression relate to the driver interaction with the steering assembly and how the post- crash deformations can aid in the interpreta- tion of accident data. * Numbers in brackets designate References at end of paper Factors that could influence the level of column compression and steering wheel defor- mation were investigated in controlled sled experiments using components from a ball- sleeve column steering system in an open fixture. Various experimental impact simula- tions were selected to produce a wide range of column compression and steering wheel deformation and the degree of deformation was compared with selected mechanical responses of the Part 572 anthropomorphic dummy. The experimental results were further confronted with field accident data involving vehicles with a ball-sleeve column and exploring mainly the relationship between the pattern of steering system deformation and driver thoracic injury. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY Part 572 dummy frontal impacts of a ball- sleeve energy absorbing steering assembly were conducted in a series of Hyge sled tests. The test fixture shown in Figure 1 provided a controlled, repeatable trajectory of the surrogate into the steering assembly. The fixture consisted of a hard seat, crush- able foam knee restraint, a fixed foot rest and a mounting framework for the steering column. The initial seated posture of the surrogate (Figure la), the 20° column angle (from horizontal), and the wheel height were selected for an axial impact of the thorax with the steering assembly. The upper rim of the steering wheel passed directly under the dummy's chin. The knee restraint was posi- tioned to restrain the lower body at the time of the thoracic contact with the steering wheel. A loose belt was placed around the Part 572 dummy thighs to prevent the surro- gate from falling from the sled fixture. This belt did not act as a lap belt. The test did not model all aspects of a vehicle crash environment or of a production steering system. The test fixture did not have a windshield or instrument panel to absorb part of the upper body kinetic energy. Steering components consisting of columns, wheels and shear capsules were from a recent model subcompact. The steering column was rigidly mounted to the fixture as shown in Figure 2. 1947 0096-736X/83/9102-1947$02.50 Copyright 1983 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">1948 j- d* MORSCH, ET AL.

A force trans- ducer was placed between the lower end of the column and the sled fixture and measured the axial reaction force of the column. The upper column was attached to the fixture through the shear capsule bracket. In addi- tion to the 20° column angle tests, we also conducted tests with column angles of 35° , 43° and 50° to introduce various amounts of off-axis surrogate loadings of the steering system. The location of the steering wheel hub was maintained in the same relationship with the fixture for all column angles. Sled velocities of 19 to 37 km/h were used to provide a range of the severity of the surrogate interaction with the steering system. Figure 3 shows sled acceleration profiles. Several tests were conducted with a mechanically "locked" energy absorbing column. The "locked" column was simulated by placing a tube over the lower column such that the force was transmitted from the upper column through the tube to the mounting clamp, Figure 4. 20 ' I c &gt; V.

The hands were removed and the wrist clevis pushed onto the steering wheel rim. The tight fit provided a secure "grip". Straightening the arms forced the Part 572 dummy rearward in the seat and provided a small preload on the steering assembly. The elbow joints were adjusted as tight as practical. In another test, the arms were slightly bent and the joint stiff- ness reduced to simulate partial bracing. Measurements in the Part 572 dummy con- sisted of thoracic spinal triaxial accel- eration and chest compression. Steering assembly measurements included column com- pression, lower column reaction force, upper column axial acceleration, and steering wheel triaxial force (as measured by the trans- ducer* between the wheel and column) , Figure 2. Other instrumentation provided data on sled acceleration, various timing signals and dummy kinematics from lateral high speed movies. DESCRIPTION OF RESPONSES - Column compression is defined as the axial displace- ment of the upper column relative to the lower column. For our rigid test fixture, shear capsule separation and column compres- sion are identical. Column compression is the maximum observed during the test and may be greater than the final value observed after the test. In some tests, the steering wheel was loaded rearward by the legs with sufficient force during surrogate rebound to reduce or "pull back" the column by as much as 1.4 cm. The tests which list a 15 cm column compression were limited by fixture interaction with the steering column. The column may have compressed farther without the mechanical interference. Column compression force is the axial reaction force measured at the bottom of the lower column during column compression. The reported force of column compression is the mean value during the time of compression. The column compression force level at 3 ms duration was determined during the surro- gate's interaction with the steering system but excluded any force developed as the column bottomed against the mounting bracket. The interaction force between the surro- gate and steering column was measured by a triaxial force transducer located between the steering wheel and column. The axial compo- nent was coincident with the column axis and the off-axis component in a vertical plane which passed through the column axis. The lateral component was much smaller than the others in our tests, and thus not included for this study. The interaction force was not inertially compensated for the approxi- mately 3 kg mass of the steering wheel and transducer. The force level at 3 ms duration * This transducer added 1.3 kg to the upper column mass and extended the steering wheel 40 mm from the column along the column axis. was determined for the resultant and the axial component separately and may not have occurred at the same time. The angle relative to the column axis of the interaction force was determined by cross plotting the axial and off-axis component of force during column compression. Even though the angle of force varied considerably during the interaction, an effective angle could be estimated consistent with the highest force and the initial portion of the column com- pression.

In some cases the deformation was slight and could only be determined by comparison with new wheels. Photographs of deformed wheels are shown in Figure 6. The wheel deformation rating can only be used as a general consequence of the interaction and is obviously not a rigorous measurement of the state of deformation. RESULTS EXPERIMENTAL STUDY - Off-Axis Impact - Off-axis loading of the column was varied by conducting tests having 20°, 35°, 43° and 50° initial column angle. As expected the interaction force tended to be horizontal. Thus, the estimated interac- tion force angle relative to the column axis approximated the initial column angle, Table 1. The resultant interaction force increased with column angle, Figure 7. How- ever the axial component of the interaction force did not change significantly. This force acting to compress the column was inde- pendent of the level of off-axis surrogate force in our test environment. This is further confirmed by the measured column com- pression force, Figure 7, which is also inde- pendent of column angle. The increased interaction force with increased column angle was due to the off-axis vector addition to the constant force acting to compress the column. The resultant force multiplied by the cosine of the column angle closely ap- proximates the measured axial component of force. The upper column axial acceleration decreased as the column angle was increased (Figure 8) and thus, the inertial component of the axial interaction force was less for steeper column angles. However, this de- crease appeared to be off-set by other fac- tors. The thoracic spinal acceleration was not influenced by column angle variation (Fig- ure 7) . The maximum chest compression increased slightly with increased column angle. However, the location of the steering wheel rim varied with column angle. A steeper column angle resulted in a higher positioned initial rim contact on the surro- gate, in an earlier rim contact with more rim deformation before the column compressed, a greater downward trajectory of the wheel hub, and slightly different surrogate kinematics. 60 # .1 40 ' ' 2 ' o&gt; ' a» ' 0 ' &lt; ' c V E • 1 20 • k.

Column compression and the maximum column compression velocity were influenced by col- umn angle, Figure 7. The off-axis component of the interaction force acted to restrain the surrogate but not to compress the column, which resulted in decreased column compres- sion as the column angle was increased. The greater amount of energy absorbed in deform- ing the steering wheel also acted to reduce column compression at larger column angles. "Locked" Column - The performance of a "locked" column was simulated by mechanically preventing the steering column from compres- sing (see Table 2, and Figure 4). There was a substantial increase in the thoracic responses of the surrogate and interaction force with a "locked" column as compared to the response observed with a normal column, Figure 9. Sled Velocity - Axial impacts with a 20° column angle were conducted at sled veloci- ties ranging from 19 to 37 km/h. Column com- pression was strongly influenced by sled velocity, Figure 10. The data demonstrates a threshold in velocity for our test conditions below which no compression occurred. The resultant thoracic spinal acceleration was also influenced by sled velocity while the maximum chest compression and resultant interaction force was less sensitive, Fig- ure 11. 60 Allocked 60 - ^cn / C / 0 / J / • p 8 m/ / /'--locked p «i 8 8 40 ■ W / / = 40 " / «i O / standard = | 40 / 1 J -i / " V ¡2 B • S V » £ 2 20 ' o 20 ' - standard .e to I- o&gt; xz g o m 0J ■ 0 J . - 0 20 40 0 20 40 Sled Velocity (km/h) Sled Velocity (km/h) Fig. 9 - Comparison of thoracic responses for standard and locked columns - 20° column angle - Seated initial posture Arms Braced - Bracing the arms of the Part 572 dummy in a fully extended position against the steering wheel (Figure 1) pro- duced a significantly different interaction of the dummy with the steering assembly. There were two basic differences: 1) the load on the steering wheel was concentrated at the hands instead of distributed on the thorax, and 2) the initial coupling of the dummy to the steering system allowed ride down which significantly reduced the velocity buildup of the upper body relative to the steering system compared to the standard test. _ , fixture limit Ä I _ 15 " , " ~t~ Ä § • £ 10 " • o. i e I 5 " &lt;3 • • I 0 » ► 0 20 40 Sled Velocity (km/h) Fig. 10 - Column compression as a function of sled velocity - 20° column angle - Seated posture</page><page sequence="7">STEERING SYSTEMS 19 5 3 Standard Seated Posture Arms Braced Posture 80 80 60 " * • • .

When the force was applied to a weak portion of the rim between the spokes, the rim deformed severely with littlę or no col- umn compression. When the force was on the rim at the spokes, there was much less wheel deformation and full column compression. Figure 12 provides sequence photos from the high speed movies to illustrate various sur- rogate kinematics with this type of interac- tion. In all tests with full bracing the interaction force and surrogate thoracic responses were significantly lower than ob- served in similar tests without bracing, Figure 11. The interaction force in fully braced tests is at the threshold necessary to compress the column. There was little dif- ference in force among tests where the column compressed, and tests where the steering wheel was severely deformed with little or no column compression. The inertia of the upper column mass acts to compress the column dur- ing sled acceleration. Thus, a lower surro- gate force is required to compress the column for this condition. Arm bracing can produce significant deformation of the steering wheel and results in greatly reduced amplitudes of surrogate responses, irrespective of whether the column compresses.</page><page sequence="8">1954 J • D. HORSCH, ET AL. Comparison of Column Compression and Steering Wheel Deformation to Other Measured Responses - Surrogate responses did not cor- relate with the rating of steering wheel deformation, Figure 13, for our test condi- tions. Surrogate response also did not cor- relate with the level of column compression, Figure 14. However, there may appear to be a correlation, if only one parameter is varied. In particular, variation in sled velocity would indicate an increasing interaction force with increasing column compression, whereas variation in column angle would indi- cate a decreasing force with increasing col- umn compression. Obviously the mechanics of the possible interactions were so varied and interrelated that the post-test level of either wheel deformation or column compres- sion was insufficient to describe the impact event . 50 50 10 » » I 40 m 40 8 : • - • •• ; 30 s 30 : # I 6 s- % « o&gt; 1 I e « I m o&gt; a O» m O &lt; S • «Ē I • C " &lt; «Ē .2 I 20 t • I20 ! £* • • oc i I g- I - • I • oc g- m ~ • Ë • t 5 g- i m I ~ • Ě ts • i ł~ « s E 10" ° 10 I 2 m 0J . o ■ • * 0 1 None Minor Moderate Severe None Minor Moderate Severe None Minor Moderate Severe Steering Wheel Deformation Steering Wheel Deformation Steering Wheel Deformation Fig. 13 - Various responses compared to steering wheel deformation rating (locked column tests omitted) 50 50 10 *• mÍ "ti A' « • 40 I 8 " .

The file contains a wide spectrum of accidents which are not overly biased toward serious injury exposures. However, it is not a statisti- cally representative sample of the U.S. acci- dents. Automotive accidents were selected on the basis of a towaway and at least one injured occupant. Our case selection was limited to: 1) frontal (11, 12, and 1 o'clock), 2) all GM cars with ball-sleeve columns (Model years from ball-sleeve column introduction in 1969 through those cases available, some 1978 models), and 3) unre- strained or lap-belted drivers. Cases were eliminated if they involved a truck, heavy second impact, roll-over, or an accident for which frontal impact was not the predominant direction of deceleration. This resulted in 154 cases. Table 3 lists the cases categor- ized by shear capsule separation, steering wheel deformation and thoracic injury. Tho- racic injury was restricted to that associ- ated with the steering system contact. The AIS injury rating is based on the methods in use prior to the 1980 revision. Although the data base required accidents having an injured occupant (not necessarily the driver) , many of the accidents may not have been sufficiently severe that the driver would measurably deform the steering system. In fact, 30 cases (19% of the accidents) reported no steering wheel deformation, shear capsule separation, or occupant thoracic injury. There were 54 cases (35%) with no shear capsule separation, and none of these cases involved thoracic injury of AIS &gt; 2. The shear capsule separation range of 1 to 25 mm contained 70 cases (45%) - 50 cases in the 1 to 13 mm separation having one AIS 3 thoracic injury and 20 cases with 14 to 25 mm separation having three AIS 3 thoracic injur- ies. Only one AIS&gt;3 injury to other body regions was associated with the steering assembly . DISCUSSION Although our laboratory tests only partially simulate a vehicle collision and driver interaction with the steering system, the results significantly improve our under- standing of some possible modes of driver interaction with the steering assembly and factors influencing column compression and steering wheel deformation. However we used only one type of column and steering wheel in a specific laboratory test. Analysis of a selected sample of accident data involved only GM cars with ball-sleeve columns. These cars were from model years prior to that of the steering components used in our experi- mental study. * Collision Performance and Injury Report Table 3 - University (HSRI) Accident Data - Frontal (11, 12 and 1 o'clock) - GM Ball-Sleeve Columns - Unrestrained or Lap-Belted Drivers 154 Cases Shear Capsule Steering Wheel Thoracic Injury* (AIS) Totals - Wheel Separation (am) Deformation Rating Deformation • 0 1 2 J&gt;3** None Minor Severe none 30 A 0 0 34 0 minor 11 2 0 0 13 severe 5110 7 none 9 2 0 0 11 1-13 minor 16 8 0 1 25 severe 9 A 1 0 1A none 5 3 0 0 8 1A-25 minor 5101 7 severe 3002 5 none 1 0 0 0 1 26-75 minor 2 3 0 1 6 severe 3 5 0 2 10 none 1 0 0 0 1 &gt;75 minor 3 110 5 severe 1 2 1 3 7 Injury Totals 10A 36 A 10 Wheel Deformation Totals 55 56 A3 * Thoracic injury due to steering system interaction. ** There were no cases of thoracic injury with AIS &gt; 3. COLUMN COMPRESSION - Analysis of a selected sample of frontal, towaway, injury producing accidents involving unrestrained or lap belted drivers in GM cars found eighty- one percent of the accidents with less than 26 mm of shear capsule separation and 8% with more than 75 mm (Table 3) . Garrett [4] found 76% of the accidents with less than 26 mm of column compression when an occupant required hospital treatment. The slightly increased frequency may be due to the selection of more severe accidents than in the data base we studied. The low percentage of cases having large shear capsule separation or column com- pression has lead some investigators [1,4] to presume that the energy absorbing column may not be functioning properly in some acci- dents. Expectations of the level of column compression based on laboratory tests of the steering components may be misleading. Lab- oratory test conditions are probably more favorable for column compression than actual vehicle accidents due to: 1) laboratory im- pact simulations being at the upper extreme Of the spectrum Of field accidents; 2) the favorable alignment used in laboratory tests; 3) the absence of automotive interior compo- nents that absorb energy; 4) the lack of possible occupant "bracing", tensing, or shifting of position prior to a crash; and 5) the overly rigid test surrogates - There are many possible reasons for the preponderance of shear capsule separations below 26 mm. In fact, the final shear cap- sule separation may not represent the maximum occurring in the accident when "pull back" of the column or additional frontal crush occurs. More importantly, our laboratory study has demonstrated several factors which likely influence the amount of column com- pression due to occupant interaction. The experimental data indicates that the general</page><page sequence="10">1956 J. D. HORSCH, ET AL. pattern of steering system deformation found in accidents is an expected outcome of a properly functioning system. Sled Velocity - Sled velocity and acceleration strongly influenced the level of column compression, Figure 10. The amplitude of the interaction force and thoracic responses were diminished in low velocity impacts. Our data demonstrates that one likely reason for low compression in field accidents is related to a low severity impact where low injury rates would be expected. The analysis of field accidents (Table 3) confirmed that there was almost no serious thoracic injury when the shear capsule sepa- ration was less than 14 mm (one AIS=3 injury for 104 such accidents) . Off-Axis Impact - Many factors in a car crash contribute to off-axis occupant inter- action with the steering system, such as: nonfrontal impact, off-set of the vehicle with the impacted object, the driver not directly in line with the steering system, and design and crash induced variations in steering column angle. Some investigators of steering system impact performance have sug- gested that off-axis impact by the driver might compromise the ability of the column to compress . The column angle was varied to simulate a range in the off-axis component of the inter- action force of the Part 572 dummy on the steering system. We feel this was the best parameter to vary because it had only a mini- mal effect on lower body restraint and upper body trajectory. In these 36 km/h tests the column compressed at least 53 mm irrespective of column angle. Although it could be pre- sumed that the dummy achieved a better align- ment with the column axis after the initial impact and then compressed the column, the cross plots in Figure 5 clearly show this presumption is incorrect. Column compression occurred in spite of large off-axis forces. In fact the off-axis component exceeded the axial component in many of the tests with the steepest column angle. The test results (Figure 7) indicated that the interaction force axial component was insensitive to off-axis load even when the off-axis component exceeded the axial component. The compression force of the energy absorbing element was also insensitive to off-axis forces. We did not observe in- creased column compressive force in our tests, even at the steepest column angle. As the column angle was increased and the impact was more off-axis, the resultant of the interaction force increased due to the vector addition of the off-axis force. Increased column angle and thus increased off-axis loading decreased column compres- sion. However the increase of the surrogate thoracic responses was small in relation to the decrease of column compression, demon- strating that a decrease of column compres- sion due to off-axis impact does not infer a corresponding increase of the mechanical severity of the occupant interaction with the steering assembly. The geometry and mounting of the column can influence the force and bending moment distribution on the column due to an off-axis interaction force. The stiffness of the structure supporting the column can also be an important factor. In our tests, the col- umn was attached to a rigid fixture. This differs significantly from a vehicle which can deform during the crash. Figure 15 shows the assumed distribution of forces and moments for our off-axis tests and demon- strates that tests with a steep column angle induced a large moment on the column. How- ever this loading may not be completely representative for a vehicle. The moment acting at various parts of the column depends on the magnitude and location of the off-axis force and on the relative location of the steering wheel, shear capsule mount, energy absorbing element, and lower column mount. / ^w-Axial Component . /nteradion Force / V- Moment /X/" Shear » Xv ^psule » ' ^sXotf-Axis ' Component - Pin Joint ' Column Reaction Compression Force Force Fig. 15 - Assumed force and bending moment distribution for test fixture Occupant Reaction - In at least some frontal accidents there may be sufficient time for the driver to react and attempt to protect himself by bracing against the steer- ing wheel. This could significantly increase the driver1 s coupling to the vehicle at the onset of crash forces. Coupling would pro- vide significant ride down even if the brac- ing force was not sufficient to prevent steering wheel contact. Obviously, the interaction of the upper body with the steer- ing system would be reduced as would be the potential for column compression. With suf- ficient arm force on the rim, steering wheel deformations may occur as in our tests with the Part 572 dummy arms extended. The question is not if drivers react in preparation against an impending frontal crash, but if sometimes they can sustain a sufficient arm force to increase the positive benefits of ride down, reduce the severity of the interaction with the steering system, or even bend the steering wheel and compress the column. A study of 45 male college students [5] pushing between parallel walls, indicated a mean maximum static exertion force of 1.28 kN with a maximum of 1.68 kN. If the</page><page sequence="11">STEERING SYSTEMS 1957 inertial contribution of the arms is added to the muscle force, it can be speculated that some drivers would be capable of deforming the steering wheel. This speculation is strengthened by a recent report of a belt restrained volunteer driver in a staged car to car crash in which the reaction load of the arms on the steering system was 3.2 kN [6]. This value is very close to the 3.3 to 3.9 kN force measured with the Part 572 dummy in our arms braced sled tests which resulted in large deformation of the wheel and/or compression of the column in all cases. Loading of the steering wheel by the arms may be an important factor in the field per- formance of the energy absorbing steering system. Extended arms would reduce both occupant injury and modify steering system deformations. We found substantial changes in steering system deformation and a greatly reduced interaction severity when the surro- gate's arms were braced on the wheel. Locked Column - Tests with a mechanically locked column demonstrated that for nearly axial impact with the column the interaction force and thoracic responses increased signi- ficantly if the column was prevented from compressing. Thus, a column that fails to compress when sufficiently loaded will likely increase the mechanical severity of the interaction. The accident analyses found almost no steering assembly related injury for low compression cases and that thoracic injury generally increased in parallel with column compression (shear capsule separa- tion) , Figure 16. The trend appears similar in some respects to that reported by Garrett [4] and plotted in Figure 17. Our accident analyses demonstrates that if injury is con- sidered, the general pattern of low values of column compression is not an indication that the occupant protection function has been compromised but that other factors are re- sponsible for the ultimate level of column compression in field accidents such as occu- pant loading alignment with the column axis, accident severity, occupant reaction to the impending accident, and the presence of other components such as the windshield. Comparison of Column Compression and Surrogate Responses - The results of our study strongly suggest that the performance of the ball-sleeve steering system cannot be inferred from column compression. We found no direct correlation between column compres- sion and the severity of surrogate interac- tion as measured by force or thoracic responses, Figure 14. The lack of correla- tion is due to the complex interaction of "response," "surrogate" and "test" param- eters. Variations in some parameters decreased the interaction severity and de- creased column compression (such as sled velocity) while others increased the inter- action severity as column compression decreased (such as off-axis loads). Tests with braced arms demonstrated that column compression is interrelated with steering wheel deformation and the level of bracing. However, the severity of the interaction was greatly reduced by fully bracing the arms in all cases. 40 O ZI-AIS^ I / t 20- AIS -3 I JE A "H " (54) (50) / (20) (17) (13) number £ // of cases a- 0 - - 1 1 1 0 1-13 14-25 26-75 &gt;75 Shear Capsule Separation (mm) Fig. 16 - Comparison of thoracic injury (associated with steering assembly contact) to shear capsule separation ranges - University of Michigan (HSRI) frontal accident cases for unrestrained and lap belted drivers - CM cars - Data from Table 3 40 • "x 52 0 ā ß &gt; 1 inch ■g / column compression 1 /' - 20" /* ?

HORSCH, ET AL* STEERING WHEEL DEFORMATION - Steering wheel deformation and the force required to cause deformation depend on the load distri- bution on the steering wheel. The steering wheel bends at force levels below that re- quired to compress the column. This was dynamically demonstrated in our test with the surrogates arms extended which resulted in severe deformation of the wheel with no com- pression of the column when the arm loading was on the rim between the spokes. However distributed load of an axial thoracic impact resulted in much less steering wheel deforma- tion, even with a "locked" column which had the greatest interaction force in our tests. An increased local loading and deforma- tion of the steering wheel rim occurred in off-axis impacts as the column angle increased. Obviously local loading of the steering wheel can occur in various ways in actual crashes, e.g. loading by the arms, off-axis interaction due to column angle or non-frontal impact. Non-axial impact of the steering system should be expected to increase wheel deformation. Figure 13 provides a plot of steering wheel deformation and various interaction responses. Our results strongly suggest that a simple steering wheel deformation rating is a poor criterion of the level of loading. Field Data Analysis - Analysis of 154 frontal accidents corroborates our experimen- tal finding that steering wheel deformation generally occurs at a lower force than column compression, the amount of deformation strongly depending on the load distribution. On this basis steering wheel deformation, even severe, should be expected in the absence of shear capsule separation (20 cases - 7 severe). However, when shear capsule separation occurs, steering wheel deformation should be expected. Of the 30 cases having greater than 25 ram shear capsule separation, 28 cases involved steer- ing wheel deformation. The 55 cases without wheel deformation all reported less than an AIS 2 thoracic injury associated with the steering assembly. All 14 cases of thoracic injury (AIS&gt;1) involved steering wheel deformation. Injury might appear to have a strong association with steering wheel deformation on this basis. However, 86% of the cases with steer- ing wheel deformation were not associated with thoracic injury of AIS&gt;1. Severe steering wheel deformation has been used to indicate heavy occupant loading [1] . The 43 cases involving severe steering wheel deformation included 33 cases with minor or no thoracic injury (AIS&lt;2) and only four of these 33 cases had an injury (AIS&gt;1) to other body regions (associated with steering assem- bly contact) . Steering wheel deformation is obviously an indication of occupant loading, but not a direct index of the level or conse- quence of loading. Severe steering wheel deformation with less than one inch shear capsule separation has been used as a steering system failure criterion [1]. Our accident data analysis and test results do not support and actually contradict this failure criterion. Of the 28 cases which would be classified as failures by this criterion, 22 involve minor or no injury (AIS=0 or 1) associated with the steering assembly, obviously not a failure of the steering system to protect the driver. CONCLUSIONS The results of a limited experimental study of factors influencing the compression performance of a ball-sleeve steering column revealed that compression of the steering column was influenced by multiple factors: 1. Both column compression and the severity of the surrogate interaction with the steering system were generally lower with decreasing sled velocity. In contrast, increased off-axis loading of the steer- ing column slightly increased the sever- ity of the surrogate-steering wheel interaction with decreased column com- pression. In these tests, the force com- ponent aligned with the column axis did not change even when the primary load was applied more than 50° from the column axis. 2. The level of column compression and the degree of steering wheel deformation were both significantly affected when the sur- rogate's arms were fully extended against the steering wheel. A wide spectrum of results, ranging from full compression to no compression was produced in identical tests depending on the location of the braced arms on the steering wheel rim. The fact that less force is required to deform the steering wheel than to com- press the column resulted in steering wheel deformation before the column com- pressed except for the case of a well distributed axial loading. 3. In general, neither column compression nor steering wheel deformation correlated with the mechanical severity of the sur- rogate interaction with the steering assembly, thus indicating that the inten- sity of driver's interaction with the steering system need not be directly related to the degree of column compres- sion or steering wheel deformation in car accidents. Analysis of 154 frontal towaway accidents of General Motors 1969-78 cars involving unre- strained and lap belted drivers, investigated by the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute team further confirmed that: 1. Cases reporting little or no column compression were not associated with steering assembly related injury. This indicates that the occupant protective function was not compromised in these cases. Other factors such as impact severity, impact direction, occupant reaction to the impending impact and</page><page sequence="13">STEERING SYSTEMS 1959 steering wheel deformation are responsible for the level of column compression. 2. Most of the cases of steering wheel deformation were reported in accident cases where little or no column compres- sion and no injury attributed to the steering assembly occurred. However, almost all cases having thoracic injury or larger amounts of column compression reported steering wheel deformation. This general pattern is expected for a steering assembly in which the steering wheel deforms at a force lower than that required to compress the column. Steer- ing wheel deformation is obviously a sign of occupant loading, but not necessarily an immediate index of the severity or consequence of the driver's interaction with the steering system.
