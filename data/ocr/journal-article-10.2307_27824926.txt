<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Early Account of a Fired Clay Anthropomor phic Figurine from Marin County FRANKLIN FENENGA In 1952, while clearing out a file, Dr. William Duncan Strong passed on to me a folder of scraps of notes about California ethnography and archaeology accumulated during his student days at Berkeley. One of these notes was a newspaper clipping which permits us to add one more specimen to the corpus of 40 fired clay figurines recorded from Marin County by Goerke and Davidson (1975) and one more site to the list of 15 from which they have been reported. The original account appeared in the Oak land Tribune, October 21, 1924, under the byline of Frank Cliff, and it is here repeated with minor editorial emendations consisting primarily of the elimination of a now irrelevant speculation on how it might have been intro duced by a traveling Hopi and how the Coast Miwok are related to the main body of Miwok speakers: 1,000 YEAR OLD POTTERY ART DUG UP: Clay Figurine, Revealing Traces of Color, Is Unearthed from Tiburon Peninsula Shell Mound. By Frank Cliff Was the California Indian on the verge of developing the pottery art when the white man came into the land and drove him from his ancient holdings? This is the question which has arisen over the finding of a small, crudely moulded pottery figure of a man excavated Sunday from a shell mound on the Tiburon peninsula in Marin County. The find is a startling one as the making of pottery or the development of a figure art was unknown or unpracticed by the California Indian tribes. Yet the figu rine is decidedly a step in both directions. Resembles Hopi Art If the figurine was not made by the tribe occupying the mound in which it was found, then it opens up the interesting alternative of having been carried into the bay region from the land of the Hopi Indians in Arizona. It greatly resembles certain figures of amulets which have been in use by those Indians for a long period of time and which have not changed their form despite the advancement which the Hopi art has made. There is then the possibility that the little figure was the protecting god of one of these wanderers who reached as far as the Tiburon peninsula and there died. His remains were interred in the mound on the shore of the bay along with his belongings and the little god of clay.</page><page sequence="2">FIRED CLAY ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURINE 309 The figurine, which is quite archaic in form, has been moulded and the finger prints of the primitive artist are still dis cernable. There are traces of coloration on the body which was moulded as though clothed in a blanket. The colors have been almost entirely weathered away, however, and there is no chance of identifying anything resembling design. This type of baked clay figure was found distributed over a great part of southwest America and Mexico and even well down into South America. But never has it been found in the coast section of California or as far north as the bay region toward the east. Whenever found, how ever, it has always marked the start of the figure art. The figurine was turned from its earthen resting place by a group of exca vators consisting of Captain Jack Shickell, who has spent considerable time among the Indians of the Amazon basin; Milton Robinson and Ellsworth Shaffer, local artists; Dr. Louis Mullikin and Frank Cliff. In the same mound and close to the clay figure, were found a number of badly conditioned skeletons and a quantity of ornaments. The mound itself was one of the older type. Owing to the absence of any time scale it is doubtful as to what its age might be. Evidence deduced from the amount of mold and earth which has accumulated on top of the shells and debris left by the Indian inhabitants, would lead to the belief that the age goes close to a thousand years. Further excavations are to be made at the site in the hope of turning up other articles which might throw light upon the origin of the little clay figure. Unfortunately the account of the context in which it was found is limited to the general location of the site and the suggestion that it was in association with a burial. The de scriptive data are also limited but for the observation that it was hand modeled and bore traces of paint. Cliff interpreted the figurine as Fig. 1.

Copy from newsprint photo. that of a "man," reading the protuberances as arms, but comparison with the other speci mens from the area leaves little doubt but that breasts of a female are represented. The illus tration of the specimen, copied from a photo gravure (Fig. 1), shows that it shares with other local specimens the fact that limbs are not represented. It differs from other Marin County pieces in that a head is represented by a process of flattening the upper end into the form of a compressed disc. No facial features are recognizable. If the reporter does not satisfy our des criptive needs with respect to observational data, he does address himself to three of the intellectual questions raised by the specimens. (1) Does a knowledge of the plastic quality of wet clay and its radical alteration by firing represent a prelude to pottery? (2) Are the figurines of Central California derived from other sources?
