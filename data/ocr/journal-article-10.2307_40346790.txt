<plain_text><page sequence="1">Twin Study by Stacey Richter, Counterpoint, 2007, $24.00, cloth, ISBN 9781582433714. Satire is a tough art to master and those who do it well are in short supply. This has been true throughout time and it is especially true today, as an increasing number of satirists are creating material for television and film rather than the page. This has left a great opportunity for new writers to enter the fray and Stacey Richter, now on her second collection of short stories, is clearly up to the challenge. Richter, who is a four-time Pushcart Prize winner, writes with the same confidence and wit of her female contemporaries Lorrie Moore and Aimee Bender. Like these writers and the deeper lineage of great satirists from Swift to Vonnegut, she addresses issues of human identity and suffering in purely original ways, often pitting a single character against a strange and inhospitable world. Her first collection, My Date With Satan, is notable for the clarity of her first-person narratives, but Richter has proven with this collection that she can bring her work to new and more complex levels. The stories in Twin Study are varied in terms of perspective - there's classic first-person, epistolary first-person, second-person, and third-person - but they are also well built and lead the reader, as all good satires do, toward a view of the human condition and the many states of pain and longing that we suffer. The title story is indicative of her skill as it opens with its first-person dilemma in full view: I've been a human specimen going on twenty years now, ever since my sister and I were twelve, when my parents enrolled us in the California State University Twin Study. Every four years the two of us, along with several hundred other pairs of identical twins from California meet in the same depressing chain hotel in Fresno to be tested, prodded and poked. "You are special!!!" begins the notice for every one of these meetings. Whoopee. I'm special. The sisters in this story are emotional opposites, one rambunctious and the other reticent, and though each is unhappy they decide to switch identities. This is a tall order, but Richter proves that she can make these characters vulnerable while also moving the plot along at a fast clip. Like the lifelong friends in her story "Duet," these twins are complete and, at times, heartbreakingly human for their misguided impulses and reactions to the people and situations around them.

Stories like these are classically satiric for their use of alternative realities, anthropomorphism, and social extremes, but Richter does a nice job of using these techniques to push her characters to emotional extremes. In "Christ, Their Lord," the main character is not only burdened by a failing relationship, she must also deal with the sentiments of her neighbors and the friendship she has started with a reclusive neighbor who lives in the shack behind his parents' house. In the end, she rebuffs the neighbor's advances and in retaliation he constructs a horribly complex - and very funny - Christmas display on her front lawn. He then runs off with her best friend, who regards him as an artistic genius, and the narrator is left to contemplate her loneliness: The days get longer and hotter. In the afternoons, I put on my suit and float around the pool, looking up at the clouds, feeling pissed off and betrayed while telling myself I shouldn't. What's the big deal . . . isn't that why people make things in the first place? To say all the things that have such power but sound so tame when we say them flat out: that we want love, that we're lonely, that we hate the shack, that we've always hated the shack, that we're afraid we're in the process of wasting our lives. It's moments like this that bring balance to the outlandish situations and deliver on Richter 's intricate plots; yet, her narrative dexterity is also apparent in this collection. In "A Case Study of Emergency Room Procedure and Risk Management by Hospital Staff Members in the Urban Facility" - which is notable for its title alone - she proves that human suffering can be displayed in something as bland as a clinical report. In this story, it is the behavior of the psychiatric patient and her self-identification as a princess that is most affecting. Likewise, in "The Land of Pain," Richter uses a second-person voice to tell the convincing story of a woman in physical pain who is forced to raise a "brainless" human clone of herself. The story is philosophically rich, but it is even more impressive that Richter can handle the second person 220 Harvard Review 33</page><page sequence="3">and produce a deeply sad moment at the end when the narrator must set her clone free on a farm and return to her otherwise lonely life. While a few stories in Twin Study are crippled by too much voice energy, the majority are as moving, colorful, and unrelentingly contemporary as they are original. - Lisa Nold</page></plain_text>
