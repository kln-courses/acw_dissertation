<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE THEOLOGY OF DISORDER IN THE ILIAD Robert Vacca The human condition evoked in the Iliad is tragic and pessimistic. Unredeemed suffering and loss is the inevitable fate of all persons, and the rare moments of moral courage and compassion like the meeting of Achilles and Priam in Book 24 are ephemeral, offering no hope of an enduring solution for sorrow. The gods are in large part responsi- ble for the fragility of human good fortune. They are powerful, and they intervene constantly in human affairs, but they are as a rule par- tisan, deceitful, unreliable, and frivolous. Hera hates the Trojans so much that to see them dead she is willing to abandon the Greek towns that have paid her special devotion. Zeus in Book 2 sends a false dream to Agamemnon to induce him to begin a battle that he is doomed to lose. In Book 22, Athena, disguised as Deiphobos, tricks Hektor into making his fatal stand against Achilles. Apollo in Book 16 strikes Patroklos and stuns him so that Euphorbos and Hektor can easily kill him, but in Book 22 he abandons Hektor when death draws near. Achilles' famous image of man's fate as Zeus dispensing good and evil randomly from the urns of fortune without concern for human merit and responsibility (24.525-33) expresses very well the element of divine caprice that deprives Homer's universe of stable and mean- ingful purpose. However, in another way, the action of the gods is not random. Homer has made them consistently the cause of the condition of strife, conflict, and violence that is the ground of the action of the Iliad in both a narrative and a metaphysical sense. The Greek name for this condition is eris. Eris dominates the Iliad. It is the war itself between the Trojans and Achaians; it is the feral spirit of combat that fills the R&amp;L 23.2 (Summer 1991) 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Religion &amp; Literature battle books; it is the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon that is the core of the plot; and it is the hatred that impels Achilles to seek out Hektor and kill him. Eris is so deeply set within Homer's world that it is a cosmological principle, although it might be more accurate to think of it as anticosmological since it is intrinsically destructive of all good order. I wish to raise the question why the gods of the Iliad are so deeply disordered. For not only does this question bear on the nature of the tragic in Greek epic and dramatic literature, but it also allows us to see something of the productive ambiguity of Greek religious thought that was contending with the issue of the justice of the gods. In the century that extended between roughly 750 and 650 B.C., the reli- gious pessimism of the Iliad was countered by the affirmation of the constructive justice of the gods in the Odyssey and in Hesiod's Works and Days. Hesiod's earlier poem, the Theogony, gave an account of Zeus' rise to dominion in which both disorderly and ordered divine power play crucial roles. I will discuss aspects of Homer's narrative presentation of the gods as forces of disorder, then consider how his position may be understood in light of certain aspects of Greek reli- gious thought that bear on the nature of divine power and how it is deployed. I An account of eris and how the gods are implicated in it provides a necessary beginning. The intensely competitive and conflict-oriented society of classical Greece developed a model of male personality in which the exercise of personal excellence called repeatedly for the use of physical force and aggressive behavior. Ideally, that aggressive power would be directed against the enemies of one's household and community. Socially justified in this way, the display of strength and violence is called alke and is considered a virtue.1 But when the exer- cise of violent force occurs in a context judged inappropriate, as in internecine fighting or fruitless stalemate, it is called eris. Eris and its related verbal forms are used some seventy times in the Iliad. Rich- mond Lattimore, in his widely-used translation of the Iliad, renders eris in its various contexts as hate, fighting, quarrel, discord, collision, anger, abuse, fury, battle, pride, strife, and attack - an array of terms that gives a good sense of what the Greek word means.2 The Iliad, as a poem of war, has a rich vocabulary for describing conflict and the psychological states associated with it. Eris, however, is not a merely incidental term within that group, but is used to name</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT VACCA 3 the central conflicts that give the poem its subject matter and struc- ture. The quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon is identified as eris in the prologue (1.6 and 1 .8) and then throughout the course of the poem (as at 19.64); and the wrath of Achilles (minis), which by its position as the first word of the poem has programmatic significance for the whole, is closely linked to eris as the intense anger in him that drives the conflict forward. The struggle between Menelaos and Paris for Helen, the traditional ground of the Trojan War, is also described as eris (3.100), and that war itself, the background against which the story of Achilles and Hektor unfolds, is eris (13.358, 14.389 ff.). The thematic importance of eris is also highlighted by its use in personifi- cation seven times in the Iliad at the commencement of great battle scenes where it represents the essential principle of violence and aggression that dominates the experience of war. The prominent place given to eris in the Iliad is in part owing to its traditional standing in the story of the war that was represented as the work of the gods intended to bring ruin to the Trojans, or even to mankind more widely. The events that preceded the Iliad in nar- rative order and included the causes of the Trojan War were the sub- ject of the Cypria, a seventh-century epic in eleven books that is no longer extant but that was summarized in prose by Proclus in his Chrestomathia (fifth century A.D.), a work that we possess only in the epitome prepared by Photius in the ninth century. A few fragments of the text of the Cypria from other sources have also survived (the texts relating to the Cypria are collected in Allen). This epic recounts the story of the Judgment of Paris, telling how, at the behest of Zeus, Eris (personified) interrupts the feasting at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis by causing a quarrel among Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite as to which was the most beautiful. Following Zeus' further orders, Hermes brought the goddesses to Mt. Ida in the Troad where Paris was to judge among them. Aphrodite's promise of Helen induced Paris to decide in her favor (Proclus 102, Allen 13-19). The Cypria goes on to recount how with Aphrodite's connivance Paris and Helen ran off from Sparta and were pursued in due course by the expedition of the Atreidai. The early events of the expedition were told in detail, includ- ing the stories of Iphigeneia at Aulis and of Philoctetes. The epic ended with Zeus' plan to assist the Trojans by making Achilles break away from the Greek expedition, along with a catalogue of the Trojan allies. The Judgment of Paris is a story rich in folktale motifs3 that the author of the Cypria sought to enhance with a greater dignity by con- necting it to a broader intention of Zeus, as the surviving opening lines make clear:</page><page sequence="4">4 Religion &amp; Literature There was a time when the countless races of men, roving over the world, [oppressed] the surface of the deep-bosomed earth. Zeus saw it and took pity, and with his clever mind he contrived to make light the weight of men upon the all-nourishing earth, by casting down the great eris of the Trojan War so that arduous death would make it empty. And the heroes died at Troy, while the will of Zeus was being accomplished. (Allen 1.1-7) These lines reflect a common concern in early Greek literature to ac- count for the presence of eris in the world in cosmological terms.4 The Theban Wars, the subject of the other great martial epic cycle, were, like the Trojan War, said to be instrumental to Zeus' larger purpose, the sending of war to humanity in order to relieve the burden on the earth of an excessive and impious population (Scholiast A on Iliad 1.5, Allen 117). Although the Cypria is later than the Iliad, it is reasonable to believe that the motive attributed to Zeus was well established in the tradition. It appears to be a Greek application of the ancient and widely disseminated Mesopotamian motif of how an ever-increasing and disorderly human population had to be adjusted to its correct place in the world order through a series of disasters inflicted by the gods.5 Homer, however, has reinterpreted the traditional idea of why the gods sent eris into the world. Zeus and the other Olympians in the Iliad are not represented as acting to check human excess in either numbers or vice; in fact, the opposite is true. Here the human desire is for peace, but the gods send eris by deception to overturn what is good, and the power that is set loose is one of increasing brutality so terrible that in the end it inverts the ordered world into moral anarchy. Homer's decision to begin his epic narrative in the last year of the war created the authorial problem of presenting to his audience the personalities, events, and issues proper to the war's beginning. Books 2 through 4 are largely devoted to solving this problem. The catalogues in Book 2, like the scene in Book 3 where Helen, standing on the walls of Troy with Priam, identifies for him prominent Achaian warriors arrayed outside on the plain, exemplify devices Homer uses to intro- duce his dramatis personae and to make anecdotal reference to earlier events. Thus the Catalogue of Ships refers to the death of Protesilaos on the day the Achaians first came to Troy (2.695-702), and the scene with Helen recounts the embassy to Troy of Menelaos and Odysseus that took place in the war's first year (3.203-24). Agamemnon's ex- change with Odysseus during his review of the army in Book 4 may be an implicit rejection of the story recounted in the Cypria that Odysseus tried to avoid joining the expedition and had to be tricked into it by the device of Palamedes' threat to the infant Telemachos, for here Odysseus' resolute commitment to the war is heavily stressed.</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT VACCA 5 Indeed, this is one of only two places in the Iliad where Odysseus is identified as "father of Telemachos" (4.349-55). More important to us than these accumulated incidents is the treat- ment of the cause of the war itself. It is striking that there is in Books 2-4 no direct reference to the traditional explanation, the Judgment of Paris (a point to which we shall return). What we do find in Book 2 is a combination of flashback to the gathering of the expedition at Aulis coupled with an expressed sense that the war in this, the tenth year, has become widely unpopular and has lost its sense of purpose. Then, in Books 3 and 4, the cause and purpose of the war is given direct dramatic expression in the effort to achieve peace, and the failure of that effort marks the point where the war and its outcome enter the order of necessity. In Book 2, Agamemnon decides to test the resolve of the army be- fore beginning battle. When he declares in the assembly that Zeus has turned against the Achaians and made them not warriors at all but ineffectual disgraces, the army, not angered by this taunting dis- paragement of its heroic excellence, bolts at once for the ships and is ready to sail home that very day. Odysseus, with the support of Athena, is hardly able to check the mutiny. When the host has at last reassembled, the malcontent Thersites, a low fellow, castigates Aga- memnon for his greed and incompetence, and Odysseus must put a stop to it by beating him to silence with a staff. Dissent has been stifled, at least for the moment, but the Achaian resentment of the war remains an issue. The army has grown weary of this struggle that has dragged on for nine years without resolution and serves no ap- parent purpose beyond enriching Agamemnon with whatever booty may have been taken. The crisis of morale is countered with vigorous exhortations by Odysseus and Nestor, the finest speakers in the army. Why is the war being fought? We might expect Odysseus at this point to remind the assembly that Paris ran off with Helen and committed a great crime against the sanctity of the family and the guest-host bond, an outrage to both heaven and earth. But, surprisingly, that is not how Odysseus and Nestor understand the war. There is only one reference to Paris and Helen, and that a thinly- veiled promise that there will be plenty of Trojan women to rape once the city has fallen (354-56). The Paris- Helen affair seems to be only a private quarrel between the two sons of Atreus and the Trojans and not of much interest to the army at large (cf. 1.1 52-60). It is true that the Achaians have promised to support Agamemnon,6 and while such a promise would be a commit- ment of honor the real inducement appears to be the prospect of</page><page sequence="6">6 Religion &amp; Literature booty - of gold, and of women and children to enslave (2.225-33). There is no need to negotiate with the Trojans, says Diomedes a bit later, for their city is doomed and Helen and its wealth will be there for the taking (7.399-402). What the army requires is reassurance that plunder will indeed be forthcoming despite the slow pace of the war, reassurance that is pro- vided by the claim that the Achaians enjoy Zeus' support, the topic that dominates the speeches in Book 2. Odysseus reminds the host of the omen at Aulis that Kalchas had interpreted as a sign from Zeus that the Achaians would prevail in the tenth year (299-332), and Nestor refers to portents of lightning that were Zeus' promise of their ultimate victory (350-53). The army wants to know that the gods are on its side, not because moral justification of its cause is needed - there is no hint of that in the speeches - but because it wants to be cer- tain it is on the winning side. The exhortations work well enough to quell dissatisfaction for the moment - it resurfaces in Book 3 - but we must not overestimate the force of an appeal to prophecy, signs, and omens among the Greeks. Book 2 itself opened with Agamemnon's dream from Zeus that was a deliberate deception, and the same con- tempt Agamemnon holds for Kalchas in the Iliad and Hektor for the Trojan seer Poulydamas can easily be found throughout Greek litera- ture. Anyone can declare the gods' support for what is in fact in his own interest. Certain knowledge of the will of Zeus must come from some other source. If there is uncertainty about the purposes of the gods in Book 2, the events of Books 3 and 4 resolve all doubt. The two armies are poised in readiness to begin fighting when Paris suggests a single combat between himself and Menelaos as a means of resolving the dispute short of general war. The winner is to have Helen, and the armies can disperse to their homes in peace. Menelaos accepts the pro- posal and adds that it should be formalized by a ceremony of religious oath. Both sides greet these suggestions with enthusiasm; the prospect of peace is universally welcomed, and the oath is sworn with the great- est solemnity. The sacred powers of the world order are called upon to witness and guarantee its terms. The duel is then fought, and Mene- laos prevails, although Paris is somehow able to escape with his life. Agamemnon demands the return of Helen according to the terms of the agreement, but unexpectedly Pandaros, a prominent Trojan ally, tries to shoot Menelaos with an arrow and succeeds in wounding him. Agamemnon declares that the Trojan side has violated its oath and that now the war must go on. Fighting breaks out at once and fills the rest of the day (Books 5 and 6). That evening, back in Troy, Antenor</page><page sequence="7">ROBERT VACCA 7 urges that even at this point the Trojans should honor the terms of the oath and return Helen. Paris, however, reneges on his promise and refuses to cooperate (7.345-64). Seen in this way - and this is the way the characters do see the events - the failure of the peace appears to be entirely the responsi- bility of the Trojan side. But Homer shows his audience more than he allows his characters to see, by relating as well the activities of the gods. Aphrodite, Paris' patron, had intervened miraculously to preserve his life when Menelaos was about to kill him. She then brought Paris and Helen together, and so intense is the sexuality she induces in them that she overcomes Paris' earlier willingness to surrender Helen and Helen's own explicit shame and disgust for what her life has become. Even more important is what Hera has done. When Menelaos won the duel, Zeus, asked her if the gods should confirm the result of that combat and let the war end. Hera was vehemently opposed and made a deal with Zeus giving her free rein for Troy's utter destruction, cynically betraying her own people: Then the goddess the ox-eyed Lady Hera answered: "Of all cities there are three that are dearest to my own heart: Argos and Sparta and Mykenai of the wide ways. All these, whenever they become hateful to your heart, sack utterly. I will not stand up for these against you, nor yet begrudge you. (4.50-54) She demands as well that the truce be broken, but in such a way that it would appear to be the fault of the Trojans. So although the Tro- jans hated and despised Paris and longed for an end to war, Zeus sent Athena to Pandaros, and it was the goddess who beguiled him into attempting to kill Menelaos. Men sought peace, but the gods caused the war to continue. In this sequence, it is Hera who is the dominant figure. Her savage hatred of the Trojans requires that eris be inflicted on them; if not, she threatens, eris will become the relationship be- tween herself and Zeus, threatening the Olympian community (4.38). Agamemnon, who knows nothing of these disreputable goings-on, draws the right conclusion for the wrong reasons in a speech that is one of the most solemn in Greek epic: So, the Trojans have struck you down and trampled on the oaths sworn. Still the oaths and the blood of the lambs shall not be called vain, the unmixed wine poured and the right hands we trusted. If the Olympian at once has not finished this matter, late will he bring it to pass, and they must pay a great penalty, with their own heads, and with their women, and with their children. For I know this thing well in my heart, and my mind knows it. There will come a day when sacred Ilion shall perish, and Priam, and the people of Priam of the strong ash spear, and Zeus son of Kronos who sits on high, the sky-dwelling, himself shall shake the gloom of his aegis over all of them in anger for this de- ception. All this shall not go unaccomplished. (4.157-68)</page><page sequence="8">8 Religion &amp; Literature With these words the fall of Troy has become a matter of fate, of necessity, for Zeus' will is fixed and does not fail of its purpose. And since the war is Hera's savage eris brought to earth through the seduc- tion of Pandaros, eris too has become part of the order of necessity. This is why the personified Eris appears on the battlefield when fight- ing begins after the failure of the truce, and as it will again at the beginning of Book 1 1 (3 and 73) when the long day of battle begins that leads to the death of Patroklos, and once again in Book 20 (48) when Achilles at last reenters the war to kill Hektor: Ares drove [the Trojans] on, and the Achaians grey-eyed Athene, and Terror drove them, and Fear, and Eris whose wrath is relentless, she the sister and companion of murderous Ares, who is only a little thing at the first, but there- after grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier. (4.440-45) This text shows how eris is dynamic, a violence that is capable of increasing in both scale and intensity. As this force expands through- out the later books of the Iliad we are able to see more clearly how eris is a central element in Homer's cosmology of inversion, destroying all order and capable of constructing nothing. In Book 20, eris has broken out among gods as well as men and on a scale that shows the whole structural order of the cosmos threatened: From high above the father of gods and men made thunder terribly, while Poseidon from deep under them shuddered all the illimitable earth, the sheer heads of the mountains. And all the feet of Ida with her many waters were shaken and all her crests, and the city of Troy, the ships of the Achaians. Aidoneus, lord of the dead below, was in terror and sprang from his throne and screamed aloud, for fear that above him he who circles the land, Poseidon, might break the earth open and the houses of the dead lie open to men and immortals, ghastly and mouldering, so the very gods shudder before them; such was the crash that sounded as the gods came driving together in eris. (56-66) The cosmological scale of the final stages of the conflict is carried fur- ther in Book 21, where the fight between Hephaistos, assisted by the winds, and the personified river Skamandros is a strife of the natural primordial elements of Fire, Air, and Water.7 Here we are drawing close to the pre-Socratic cosmology of Empedocles in which Strife (neikos, a synonym of eris), one of the fundamental forces of the cosmos, is polarized against its counterforce, Love (philotes). Eris grows in inward intensity as well, becoming a relentless lust to annihilate that counts among its casualties the human capacity for compassion and respect. Particularly in the later books of the Iliad the motif of warriors as carnivorous, predatory animals and the theme of</page><page sequence="9">ROBERT VACCA 9 the desecration of corpses become the dominant images revealing what eris can do to human moral character.8 The comparison of warriors to animals, particularly lions, is a traditional element in epic art, praising the prowess {alke) of heroes whose violence is justified, even noble, because it is directed against enemies. Iliadic similes often retain this convention. Thus the Achilles who confronts Aineias at 20. 164-75 is a splendid heraldic lion whose might is a sign of his "heart of valor" {alkimon etor, 169), and Aias protecting the body of Patroklos is the lion that defends its cubs against hunters (17.133-36). But as the psychosis of war grows more intense in the cumulating themes of the Iliad, even the lion can become an image of mere feral ruthlessness (24.41-43), and dogs and wolves, creatures not idealized in heroic simile, recurrent symbols of eris. The personified Eris, presiding over the field of battle, transforms men into wolves for her own delight (11.72-73). The Myrmidons, made ready for war, are like wolves that gorge on raw flesh, are stained with blood, and vomit clots of gore when they go to lap water from a spring (16. 156-63). This image foreshadows Priam's nightmare vision of the dogs, rabid (alyssontes) and frenzied by blood, that muti- late the head and genitals of the slain old man (22.70-74). Mutilation of the body is at first only a threat, but in the later books it is an actual deed. Hektor clearly intended to decapitate Patroklos and give the body to the dogs (17.125-27), perhaps even to impale the head (18.177); Lykaon and Asteropaios are fed to eels and fish in Book 2 1 ; Achilles taunts the dying Hektor with the forthcoming desecration of his body and does attempt to violate it in Book 22. The two motifs of men as carnivores and the mutilation of the corpse converge with the image of cannibalism as the final outrage done to the victim. Hera's hatred of the Trojans, which we have iden- tified as seminal for the eris theme, was so intense that cannibal muti- lation was its expressive image (4.34-6), and the same image recurs in Hekabe's hatred of Achilles (24.212-13). Achilles himself, who at 21.542 is said to have been seized by rabid frenzy (lyssa), is close to cannibalism in his final encounter with Hektor: "I wish only that my spirit and fury would drive me to hack your meat away and eat it raw . . ." (22.346-47). But the corpse is an elemental and sacred thing in the Iliad, and respect or reverence for it is in a very fundamental way a mark of civilized culture, as Apollo's condemnation of Achilles' attempts to mutilate Hektor's body is intended to underscore (24.50-4). The solemn piety of the funerals in Book 7 represents the normative practice undertaken while eris is still under control (405-32). The desecration of the corpse is thus a symbol of the universal inversion</page><page sequence="10">10 Religion &amp; Literature of humane values and the destruction of the bonds of community that is the work of eris as an anticosmological principle. II Why do the gods of the Iliad act this way? In considering this ques- tion, the first striking recognition is the extent to which Homer has downplayed narrative solutions to the question of the motives of the gods, particularly the Judgment of Paris story cited earlier. There is little reason to doubt that Homer knew the story of the wedding of Peleus and Thetis and the Judgment of Paris in much the same form we have them in the Cypria, even though the Iliad makes no allusion to the presence of Eris at Thetis' wedding and contains only one ex- plicit reference to the Judgment of Paris (24.25-30). But Homer makes no reference to this material in the scene on Olympos opening Book 4 where Hera's hatred of the Trojans is the cause of the failure of the peace.9 Karl Reinhardt is surely right in arguing that the effect of Homer's deflecting our attention from the rather frivolous story of the divine beauty contest is to make the fierce partisanship of the gods in- explicable and sinister (24.25-30). 10 Even Zeus is taken aback by a hatred that seems to have neither cause nor reason: Strange one, what can be all the great evils done to you by Priam and the sons of Priam, that you are thus furious forever to bring down the strong- founded city of Ilion? If you could walk through the gates and through the towering ramparts and eat Priam and the children of Priam raw, and the other Trojans, then, then only might you glut at last your anger. (4.31-36) By cutting away highly anthropomorphic explanations of divine be- havior, Homer, like Sophocles after him, here cleared the way for a perspective toward the gods that recognizes that their interventions are decisive, arbitrary, and ultimately beyond human understanding.11 This is not to deny that anthropomorphic explanations of specific divine actions abound elsewhere in the Iliad; the point is, however, that as the magnitude of the question grows greater, anthropomorphic narra- tive clarity diminishes. We know why Thetis aids Achilles in Book 1, but the large-scale shaping of events that is the will of Zeus is far more obscure, and no one lays claim to understanding it. A second point that bears importantly on why the gods are charact- erized as bringing disorder into the world is that Homer appears to be criticizing certain religious beliefs current in his own day that held that the gods were deeply involved with the protection of justice.12 The gods in the Odyssey aid Odysseus in the restoration of his house be- cause they are offended by the wanton excesses of the suitors, and</page><page sequence="11">ROBERT VACCA 1 1 Zeus in that poem is regularly invoked as the defender of the power- less, the beggars and suppliants, who otherwise remain at the world's mercy. Hesiod in the Theogony recounts how Zeus came to power in the world, emerging from an earlier epoch of cosmic violence to become the lord of gods and men whose reign is characterized by the offspring of his union with the Titan Themis (Right), the three "watchers over the deeds of mortal men" Eunomie, Dike, and Eirene, respectively Law-and-Order, Justice, and Peace. In the prologue of his Works and Days Hesiod invokes Zeus in language reminiscent of the psalms and prophets: Men are renowned or remain unsung as great Zeus wills it. For lightly he makes strong and lightly brings strength to confusion, lightly diminishes the great man, uplifts the obscure one, lightly the crooked man he straightens, withers the proud man, he, Zeus, of the towering thunders, whose house is highest. (4-8) This Zeus makes possible a human life free from the bitter loss inevit- able in the world of the Iliad. Thus Works and Days: But when men issue straight decisions to their own people and to strangers, and do not step at all off the road of Tightness, their city flourishes, and the people blossom inside it. Peace, who brings boys to manhood, is in their land, nor does Zeus of the wide brows ever ordain that hard war shall be with them. Neither famine nor inward disaster comes the way of those people who are straight and just; they do their work as if work were a holiday; the earth gives them great livelihood, on their mountains the oaks bear acorns for them in their crowns, and bees in their middles. Their wool-bearing sheep are weighted down with fleecy burdens. Their women bear them children who resemble their parents. They prosper in good things throughout. (225-36) Strasburger has shown that this kind of religious belief is likely to have been widespread in the culture of the late eighth and seventh cen- turies, and Kullmann argues persuasively that the Iliad author was well aware of these ideas (9-10). They are explicitly present, for ex- ample, in a simile that speaks of an angry Zeus sending a great storm to punish men who "in violent assembly pass decrees that are crooked, and drive righteousness from among them and care nothing for what the gods think" (16.384-93). They are implicated as well in the failed peace episode of Books 3 and 4, a scene whose remarkable degree of elaboration indicates that Homer wished to incorporate in his poem the current notions of divine justice in order to show that they were false, that men are deeply deceived about the gods. The ceremony of truce in Book 3 deepens this emphasis. The desire for peace that inaugurates it should be taken as parallel to the celebra- tion of peace in Hesiod. For antipathy to the war, on both sides, is stressed. When Menelaos proposed the ceremony of truce, Homer says,</page><page sequence="12">12 Religion &amp; Literature "the Trojans and Achaians were joyful, hoping now to be rid of all the sorrow of warfare" (111-12). When Paris inexplicably escapes from Menelaos' grip, the Trojans cannot find him, and Homer adds, "These would not have hidden him for love, if any had seen him, since he was hated among them all as dark death is hated" (453-54). These sentiments are given an institutional expression in and through the truce ceremony, where Homer incorporates into his narrative a con- temporary religious institution whose function was to put peace rather than conflict "in the roots of the earth" - to use the idiom of that day. The ritual language of the oath and the accompanying prayers reveals a mechanism for peacekeeping and a belief about the order of the world so fully articulated that we must be seeing an institution of real social and religious importance to the early Greek world.13 The Trojans bring two lambs, a black one for Earth and a white one for Sky, and the Achaians provide a third, for Zeus. Wine, gold cups, and mixing bowl are also brought by the Trojans. Agamemnon cuts tufts of hair from the heads of the lambs, and these are distributed among the leaders to establish physical contact with the victims. He then speaks these words of invocation: Father Zeus, watching over us from Ida, most high, most honoured, and Helios, you who see all things, who listen to all things, earth, and rivers, and you who under the earth take vengeance on dead men, whoever among them has sworn to falsehood, you shall be witnesses, to guard the oaths of fidelity. (3.276-80) The conditions of the duel between Menelaos and Paris are stated next, then Agamemnon cuts the throats of the lambs. Presumably, although the narrative is silent at this point, he allows the blood to spill onto the ground rather than onto an altar of sacrifice until the animals are exsanguinated.14 Draughts of wine are then poured out onto the ground by the people who make this prayer: Zeus, exalted and mightiest, and you other immortals, let those, whichever side they may be, who do wrong to the oaths sworn first, let their brains be spilled on the ground as this wine is spilled now, theirs and their sons', and let their wives be the spoil of others. (298-301) The ritual act of spilling combines the blood of the lambs, the wine, and the brains of those who might break the oath into a single set that symbolizes the principle of biological life.15 The threat is thus directed against the family, the fundamental unit of society through which human life has cultural continuity over the generations. The powers invoked to sanction the oath are Zeus, the dominant figure in the pan- theon, then the powers of sky, earth, and underworld - the physical cosmos. He who breaks an oath, then, would have nowhere to take</page><page sequence="13">ROBERT VACCA 13 flight; he would be making himself an outcast from the cosmos in its entirety. In Greek thought the human world is the realm of change and in- stability; the world of the gods is permanent. To create a lasting and durable relationship of peace among peoples requires that a ritual bond be joined between men and gods, so that the social condition of peace will be linked to the superordinate structure of the world, called moira, that is by its nature unchanging. Each party to the oath enters into a contract with this sacred order and the powers that defend it as a kind of self-deterrent. We invent the gods to be our conscience. But the events of Books 3 and 4 are Homer's statement that men are mistaken in this belief. There will be no peace on earth because there is no stability in heaven. Zeus knows what his obligation in ritual and in justice is and considers honoring it: For of all the cities beneath the sun and the starry heaven dwelt in by men who live upon the earth, there has never been one honoured nearer to my heart than sacred Ilion and Priam, and the people of Priam of the strong ash spear. Never yet has my altar gone without fair sacrifice, the libation and the savour, since this is our portion of honour. (4.44-49) But in the event he yields to Hera. Ill The contradiction between the Zeus of the Iliad and the Zeus of the Odyssey and of Hesiod raises for us the question of the ground concep- tion of divinity in Greek thought that can yield such opposed visions. This question is fundamental in the study of Greek religion, where at all periods there is evidence for the multiple and ambiguous ways that religious thought and practice sought to mediate between the gods as images of the chaotic powers in the world far exceeding the capacity of human will and understanding to master and, on the other hand, the need to use that power to sanction and strengthen the moral order of human society.16 Greek gods are not personifications of moral values; they are images of power, and their ambivalence in operation derives from ambivalence in the nature of power itself as the Greeks conceived it. Since a full account of this complex conceptual field is not possible here, my discussion concentrates on the idea of bie, physical force or violence,17 the concept most directly relevant to the issues raised by the Iliad.18 The social condition of competition and conflict in the early Greek world led to a definition of the male social role in relation to the de-</page><page sequence="14">14 Religion &amp; Literature fense of his household and family, a duty requiring a high degree of martial skill and physical prowess, or tie. Bie is the force which may come into action as either alke or eris. Odysseus' recovery of his home by slaying all 108 suitors is a particularly prodigious display of this masculine force! Because bie was at the center of the normative male personality, it was extended to the great male paradigms of the cul- ture-to the heroes of epic and to the gods. Achilles, the central figure of the Iliad, is defined by his bie (1 1.787; 24.42), and this is by no means exceptional. Indeed, Sarpedon's well-known portrait of the hero and the heroic code (Iliad 12.310-28) singles out precisely this "splen- did strength" as the very linchpin of heroic identity.19 Herakles, most famous of all the heroes and the only hero to whom Achilles will com- pare himself (18.117-21), is beyond all others the embodiment of bie (Iliad 5.638, 11.689 ff.; Theogony 289,315,332 ff.), and as his cele- brated labors were the sign and vindication of his bie, the combats of the warriors in the Iliad are proofs of theirs. The gods - particularly Zeus - are homologues of the heroes in this respect. The Theogony recounts how Styx brought the personified Bie and his brother Kratos (rule, dominion) "to live with Zeus always" (385-403), and again, how the Kyklopes, figures of celestial bie, gave him the thunder and the lightning bolt (139-46), and how the Hekatoncheires, symbols of chthonian bie, joined with Zeus for the great battle with the Titans (617-53). The epiphany of the bie of Zeus is the display of the violent powers of nature, impressively described at the climax of the Titanomachy: Now Zeus no longer held in his strength, but here his heart filled deep with fury, and now he showed his bie entire and indiscriminately. Out of the sky and off Olympos he moved flashing his fires incessantly, and the thunderbolts, the crashing of them and the blaze together came flying, one after another, from his ponderous hand, and spinning whirls of inhuman flame, and with it the earth, the giver of life, cried out aloud as she burned, and the vast forests in the fire screamed. All earth was boiling with it, and the courses of the Ocean and the barren sea, and the steam and the heat of it was engulfing the Titans of the earth, while the flames went up to the bright sky unquenchably, and the blaze and the glare of thunder and lightning blinded the eyes of the Titan gods, for all they were mighty. (687-99) Throughout Greek religion Zeus' association with lightning and thun- der provided the external image for a conception of power that often suggests a fantasy of masculine aggressiveness set free beyond any restraint. His epiphany is the moment of victory after struggle, the euphoria of dominance, and the fear that such violent power inspires. Burkert observes:</page><page sequence="15">ROBERT VACCA 15 The thunderbolt ... is the weapon of Zeus which he alone commands; it is irresistible, even gods tremble before it, and enemies of the god are utterly destroyed when it strikes; in the face of such a manifestation of divine energy, man stands powerless, terrified and yet marvelling . . . Every tropaion, that monument draped with booty on the battle field, can be called an image of Zeus. (126,128) Zeus' inexhaustible sexual potency is equally a reflex of this notion of power; scandalous as it certainly appeared to later generations of Greeks, even rape belongs to the essence of this figure for it is indis- putably part of bie, and Zeus' pursuit of Io in Prometheus Bound is but one of many examples. Zeus' son Herakles also possessed insatiable sexual capacity, which constitutes a further reflex of the same idea.20 There is a great deal of ambivalence in the deployment of bie be- cause it underlies simultaneously not only wanton violence but also legitimate social authority and the systems of order proceeding from that authority. In the decentralized and unstable social conditions of early archaic Greece, social power (kratos) was patriarchal and replete with intergenerational tensions. Bie was needed to take and hold it, as we see reflected in the world of myth. Zeus came to power by over- throwing his father Kronos, who had in turn castrated his father Ouranos and seized power; and when he had done so he decreed the new order of the world, assigning to each his place and privileges, establishing the rules that would henceforth define justice (Theogony 881-85). But such power is autocratic, nor is there any other power that can constrain the patriarch to submit to the rules he lays down, for no one is his equal in bie. The creator of what is right and just for others is not himself just except by his own arbitrary choosing, and the will of Zeus remains his own, unaccountable and mysterious.21 This ambivalence carries over into the human realm, for all patriarchal sovereignty comes from Zeus, from the kingship in the Homeric poems (Iliad 2.101-108) through the masculine authority at the head of each family, and the myth of Zeus was a charter for its deployment. The father tolerated no challenge to his authority, but kept his own counsels.22 If the Greek concept of bie enables us to see how the same god can be at one time just and at another arbitrary and violent, it remains to ask why the Iliad has thrown almost all the emphasis on the side of disorder.23 Some light may be brought to this question by consider- ing what might be called the narcissism of character in the Iliad, that is, the belief that the worth and integrity of the self is based on its self- achieved radical autonomy, which is, however, perpetually threatened by the denial of that autonomy by others, to be countered by violent</page><page sequence="16">16 Religion &amp; Literature self-assertion. The measure of the value of the self is a man's honor, won through individual competitive achievement and demanding recog- nition from all others. Sarpedon's famous speech to his friend Glaukos setting forth the heroic code gives us access to these themes: Glaukos, why is it you and I are honoured before others with pride of place, the choice meats and the filled wine cups in Lykia, and all men look on us as if we were immortals, and we are appointed a great piece of land by the banks of Xanthos, good land, orchard and vineyard, and ploughland for the planting of wheat? Therefore it is our duty in the forefront of the Lykians to take our stand, and bear our part in the blazing of battle, so that a man of the close- armoured Lykians may say of us: "Indeed, these are no ignoble men who are lords of Lykia, these kings of ours, who feed upon the fat sheep appointed and drink the exquisite sweet wine, since indeed there is strength of valour in them, since they fight in the forefront of the Lykians. Man, supposing you and I, escaping this battle, would be able to live on forever, ageless, immortal, so neither would I myself go on fighting in the foremost nor would I urge you into the fighting where men win glory. But now, seeing that the spirits of death stand close about us in their thousands, no man can turn aside nor escape them, let us go on and win glory for ourselves, or yield it to others. {Iliad 12.310-28) The feasts and the gifts of choice land - honors paid - are elements of ceremonies through which the Lykians acknowledge the worth or merit of their leaders and give public assent to the hero's claim to be the best of men. They are the external signs of the deference and respect that the honorable man enjoys in his community. Honor is thus both a social status and, for the individual, a confirmation of the sense of personal superiority he has literally fought to establish. It is of immense, even obsessive, importance to him; if respect is with- held the hero suffers a radical crisis of identity. Ajax, for example, is driven to suicide when his claim to the arms of Achilles is rejected, and the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon in Book 1 arises in large part on this ground. Heroic honor is a complex subject. One of its ambiguities is whether the hero is honored for what he is or for what he does. Honor is cer- tainly in part transactional. The social function of a warrior is the defense of his people, who will reward him for performing that task well, so social utility is one dimension of honor. But while honors like the gift of land given to Sarpedon and Glaukos may be of considerable material worth, it would be wrong to see in them primarily economic transactions, as though the warrior were a mercenary soldier and these honors and gifts were payments to him for services rendered.24 It is better to view them as expressions of gratitude and admiration, which, while certainly rooted in the specific deeds of the warrior that have</page><page sequence="17">ROBERT VACCA 17 preserved his community, point beyond them to recognition of what the hero is in himself- something prepotent and splendid and dread- ful. Honors indicate the ontological worth of the hero as well as his social worth. Sarpedon's comparison of the hero to the gods moves in this direc- tion. The feasts and gifts of land that show how "all men look on us as if we were immortals" (312) have their exact parallels in the hero cults of the eighth century, although those cult honors were not paid to the living. Homer uses them here in an anticipation of the immor- tality through heroic cult that can come after death.25 In the concluding lines of the speech (322-28) Sarpedon contrasts the immortality enjoyed by the gods to the honor and glory of the warrior. To be immortal as the gods are would be best; what would be worst - al though this is only implicit in the speech - would be the anonymous insignificance of a self fading into nothingness in Hades. One of the metaphysical foundations of the Iliad is its adamant insistence that death is terrible and absolutely final, and that Hades - which is not so much an after- life as it is an image of what it means to be dead - is utterly empty of life and enduring personality. In this the Iliad is very much like The Epic ofGilgamesh and the biblical Sheol (see Job 3 and Psalm 115), and stands apart from trends in contemporary Greek thought that contem- plated a more optimistic prospect for man after death.26 For Homer, then, the warrior's honor is the only kind of imitation of the enduring being of the gods that man can achieve, and that claim on Being justi- fies the reiterated confrontation with death the warrior must para- doxically endure to overcome death. Honor is a metaphysical victory over man's mortal condition. But precisely because nothingness is an abyss ever opening before a man, his claim on existence acquires a narcissistic intensity, demanding constant reinforcement and reassur- ance by acknowledgement from others. If this is withheld, the hero's hie drives him to destroy the other in ontological self-assertion. There- fore this ideological justification of the hero through honor is at the same time the elevation of force and violence to the highest moral dignity, since hie is the essence of the warrior's being and action. Killing another strong man is the most meaningful action in the human repertoire because it is an unambiguous demonstration of per- sonal superiority. To ourselves as observers of the Homeric scene, the resulting situa- tion is a disaster. Society is seen in the narrowest sort of way. War, eris, is emphasized to the virtual exclusion of everything else. War may be enacted indirectly, on the symbolic plane of athletics, as in Book 23, and it may create a limited form of political discourse</page><page sequence="18">18 Religion &amp; Literature devoted mainly to the planning and urging on of fighting. But it ex- cludes the works of peace as public and ethically significant activities, and even economic production is shunted so far aside as to become invisible. For the individual, this aggressive theory of personality is no less a disaster because he has no options, nothing to contrast it to. He has no other models of significant action that might define a serious life, and when he must face a crisis in his life the logic of this pattern constrains his response, for it is all he knows. The destructive wrath {minis) of Achilles, declared by the first line of the poem as the central subject of the Iliad, is precisely such a con- strained response. His anger was a product of the eris (1.6) between himself and Agamemnon. The story of that famous quarrel is too well- known to require repeating in detail; but certain of its features will help us see more clearly why the Iliadic model of personality makes conflict and anger virtually inevitable. When Agamemnon consented to return Chryse'is to her father, as a result of the plague Apollo sent against the Greeks, he demanded a compensatory honor; for since the whole affair was happening in open assembly he knew his public image was threatened (117-19). Political authority in the Iliad does not rest on a secure institutional basis. Leadership is personal and is legitimated by the leader's foV'and personal excellence {arete), which must be such as to command deference. Agamemnon must be able to assert his dominance or give way to one who can. It would not have been enough for him to assert the prudential wisdom of his returning Chryseis, since hie, not intelligence, is the ground of excellence.27 Achilles responds to Agamemnon's demand by denying his fitness to give orders. The king is a coward, without hie, so he has no arete, and the claim he makes to deserve honor is based on greed rather than merit: You wine sack, with a dog's eyes, with a deer's heart. Never once have you taken courage in your heart to arm with your people for battle, or to go into ambuscade with the best of the Achaians. No, for in such things you see death. Far better to your mind is it, all along the widespread host of the Achaians to take away the gifts of any man who speaks up against you. (225-30) Of course, elsewhere in the /WAgamemnon does fight, and Achilles' charge is exaggerated28; but its rhetorical point is to denigrate Aga- memnon's achievements in precisely that one activity that creates legitimate social authority. If the king has little to show here, his authority is fraudulent, and no one need obey him (149-51). The exclusivity of the martial claim to honor is demonstrated clearly throughout the passage. Achilles is implicitly denying that there is such a thing as autonomous political power. Since his own military</page><page sequence="19">ROBERT VACCA 19 successes far outstrip Agamemnon's, it is easy to see that by the logic of his position he himself should become king, and Agamemnon does indeed see and fear that conclusion (287-89). Once Agamemnon's legitimacy to rule has been so directly and publicly challenged, the situation differs little, psychologically, from that which we see in the battlefield encounters between heroes from the opposed sides. The relationship between the two leaders is one of eris, and the worth of the self is at stake. In battle the challenger calls the hie of a warrior into question by asserting the superiority of his own might, and there is no way to back down without risking the shame of cowardice. Here too, Agamemnon has no peaceful alternative. Since he must defeat the challenge, he vows to take Briseis, who is Achilles' prize of honor. This amounts to the assertion that Achilles is his in- ferior, and it is of course intolerable to Achilles, who is immediately ready to kill Agamemnon then and there, a reaction entirely consis- tent with a character that operates primarily through force, aggres- sion, and dominance. Athena must come ex machina to stop him - or perhaps we might say that only a god is fit to give orders that an Achilles can accept without losing face, since the hie of the gods is so great. In either instance, there is no ordinary value or psychological principle that could inhibit Achilles. His anger, the minis that sustained the eris that followed, is simply the form that hie must take under the circumstances. It is not possible for Achilles to abandon it - he is the prisoner of his own anger - because to do so would be to deny the hie that defines him as a person. Agamemnon's apology in Book 9 is not accepted because it provides no catharsis for that force. Only when his hie and anger have been redirected against Hektor does Achilles, in Book 19, entertain a form of reconciliation with Agamemnon. This same pattern of constrained eristic response to a challenge can, I believe, be carried over to the question of divine behavior, for the gods are analogous to the heroes. Hera conforms exactly to the rule of narcissism of character in her extreme antagonism to Troy; should that city continue to exist, it would mean a loss of face for her that would threaten the integrity of her own existence (4.57-61, 18.356-67, 20.309-17). Gods are immortal, and one would suppose them to be immune to the ontological dread of loss of being, but Greek gods are ambiguously immortal. The generations of Ouranos and Kronos were overthrown and all but forgotten (Aeschylus, Agamemnon 168-75); like a man, then, a god can be dishonored, become anonymous, lose place in Being. And like a man, a god responds with desperate violence. In default of a new ground for personal worth and the stabilty of the social order, the gods of the Iliad must act out their drama of violence.

On this episode and its incorporation of mythical motifs of great antiquity see Lord. 8. In addition to Weil's well-known essay, The Iliad or The Poem of Force, see, on the accumulating images of predation and desecration, Friedrich, Redfield (Ch.5), and Segal. I am indebted to these scholars for the ideas expressed in the following paragraphs. 9. 4.26-28 are more likely to refer to the assembling of the expedition itself, a direct consequence of Paris' insult, than to the marshalling of the Achaian forces in Book 2 as Kirk supposes (333). 10. The literary reasons for Homer's oblique use of this material are set forth by Reinhardt. Subsequent discussion of the question has been carried on by Stinton, Walcot ("Judgement"), and Davies. 11. Kullmann (7-10) shows how in the Iliad, in clear contrast to the Odyssey, the characters tend to be resigned to the arbitrary actions of the gods, which are viewed as fateful and inescapable. 12. The literature on this subject is extensive. I would single out as especially helpful Kurt Latte and David Gill. Kullmann (15-19) shows the impossibility of repre- senting the religious ideas of the Iliad and the Odyssey as compatible except in a most superficial way. He also shows that it is not tenable to posit a simple "development of thought" from Iliad to Odyssey. 13. The social-religious functions of oaths are discussed in Nilsson (139-42) and Burkert (250-54). 14. For discussion of this point see Frisch 62. 15. See Onians (108) for the ethnobiological evidence. 16. Burkert (246-50) offers an overview of this issue, which he aptly describes as the "dialectic of amoral gods and religious morality." 17. Chantraine (174) defines hie as "force physique, violence" and adds that it is distinguished from other words for force "par le fait que hie exprime volontiers la violence, se rapporte a un acte de violence." Nagy (Best 89-90) provides a philological account of hie and related terms. 18. In the Iliad the claim to honor is based almost exclusively on hie, and larger formulations of the issues are beyond the scope of this paper. It should be noted, however, that the epic tradition and Hesiod include a great deal of material weighing the rival claims of hie and metis (cleverness, intelligence) to be the authentic ground of excellence, arete. Broadly speaking, Odysseus is the champion of metis and the Odyssey vindicates his principle. But in the Iliad, as in Book 9, metis cannot even devise a way</page><page sequence="21">ROBERT VACC A 21 to regain the bie of Achilles, which is precisely the thing most urgently needed. Nagy (Best) deals with the broader issue. 19. The Greek is is esthle in lines 320-21 . Nagy (Best 90) shows that is and bie are synonyms. 20. Burkert (129) provides many examples. 21. This paradox is central to Aeschylean tragic drama. The trilogic movement of the Oresteia is an unfolding through violence and suffering of the baffling will of Zeus, culminating in the creation of a new order of justice in the Eumenides. The tragic movement in the trilogy containing the Suppliants, insofar as it can be reconstructed with some degree of probability, followed a similar course of order emerging through violence in accordance with Zeus' inexplicable will. The Prometheus plays, which are Aeschylean in conception if not by Aeschylus himself, explored how the crisis of legitimacy based on bie alone might be overcome. 22. To pursue this line of enquiry further would take us too far afield, but I would single out as especially rewarding Lamberton's Hesiod (69-104) for its fascinating ex- ploration of the dialectic between arbitrary masculine authority and female resent- ment and retaliation in Greek myth. See also Walcot ("Plato's Mother") on the theme of mothers gaining revenge through sons. 23. Even in the Iliad, however, the Janus-like ambivalence of Zeus comes to light, for he is capable of justice when he wishes it. In Book 24 Zeus protects Priam, the guest and suppliant of his mortal enemy Achilles, and affirms the sacredness of Hektor's corpse and the propriety of the proper funeral, thus bringing closure to the reign of eris. 24. On this point see Claus (23-24). 25. See Nagy, "Death" (200-203). 26. Kullmann (16-17) and Vermeule (118-44) discuss alternative conceptions of death opposed to the view taken by the Iliad. 27. In the very different world of the Odyssey, where authority is on firmer ground, King Alkinoos encounters no difficulty in collecting prizes for Odysseus, since he and the nobles can make up their losses by taking compensation from the people (13.7-15). The whole situation is far less tense. 28. The Cypria told of an earlier quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon that took place while the expedition to Troy was resting in Tenedos, when Achilles was "invited late" to a feast (Cypria, Proclus summary 104. Allen 21-24). Such an element in the tradition might help us understand why Achilles appears so antagonistic to Agamemnon. WORKS CITED Burkert, Walter. Greek Religion. Trans. John Raffan.
