Entered as second-class matter, October 2, 1942, at the Post Office at New Haven, Connecticut, under the Act of March 3, 1879. A special article was devoted to the sensational discoveries asociated with that name in one of the earliest numbers of this periodical (Vol. II. 1), and data from Ugarit have been cited in various connections in subsequent numbers. A new, and more extensive, special article at the present time is warranted by the importance of the subject, which can hardly be exag- gerated, and by the considerable quantity of new data which have become available despite the war and the interruption of excavations. I. GEOGRAPHICAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL DEFINITION OF UGARIT Near the northern end of the Syrian coast, only about 25 miles south of the present Turkish frontier, there is a cove (Fig. 1) called Minet el- Beida ("the white harbor," "Whiteport"), into which flows a small stream. Today Minet el-Beida is neither a large nor a safe harbor, and is only used by a few fishermen; and the nearest town of any size is Latakia (Fig. 2), some 7 or 8 miles to the south. However, when archaeologists became inter- ested in it 17 years ago, they discovered clear evidence that it had once been both larger and safer. At its seaward end, the white chalk cliffs from which it gets its name have been undermined by the waves and have tumbled into the sea, forming dangerous breakwaters; while at its landward end, as a result of the accumulation of sand and gravel thrown up by the bois- terous winter sea and of soil and stones swept down by the swollen winter stream, the shoreline has advanced about 400 feet during the 3,000 odd years that have elapsed since it ceased to be the busy waterfront of the prosperous city of Ugarit. Of course, it should also be remembered that the ships of those times did not require nearly such large and deep harbors as ours do. That there was once a very rich city half a mile to the southeast of the harbor has always been known to the people of the neighborhood. For here is the northwestern corner of a mound known as Ras esh-Shamrah (its ancient name was Ugarit; Fig. 3), in and around which they had often discovered valuable antiquities-including gold objects-both by chance and by treasure hunting. The attention of the scholarly world, however, was only attracted to this rather lonely spot in the spring of the year 1928, when, in the vicinity of the harbor, a peasant's plough struck what proved to be one of the stone slabs of the convex roof of a sepulcher. The latter was full of silt and valuables, and the peasants lost no time in removing most of the latter. However, the discovery came to the notice of the police, who in turn apprised the Department of Antiquities in Beirut; and when the representatives of the Department arrived they were still able to recover</page><page sequence="3">1945,2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 43 some beautiful Cypro-Mycenaean pottery of the 13th century B.C. from the rubbish. As a result, both the harbor and, more especially, the afore- mentioned mound were excavated by a French expedition headed by Mr. Claude F. A. Schaeffer for about three months every year from 1929 through 1939. (May France and Mr. Schaeffer soon be in a position to resume these epoch-making excavations.) A few exploratory shafts have revealed that the mound is the grave of not one but five cities lying one on top of the other. The lowest one is, of course, the most ancient. It flourished in the fifth, and perhaps even as early as the sixth millennium B.C. Of greatest interest to us, however, are Fig. 2. Latakia, Syria.

Obviously no stratum can be investigated methodically before those above it have been cleared away; and at present only the top one, or the younger Ugarit (c.1500-1200 B.C.), is at all well known. It is primarily with this Ugarit that we are concerned here. Roughly speaking, its history begins with the establishment-which may have been a reestablishment- of Egyptian sovereignty over this remote corner of Syria and ends with the irruption of the Aegean sea-peoples whom we also encounter in Pal-</page><page sequence="4">AW\ HA"" U AI LirI r LA Oned s fft LT N L'7 k ANAA!. 6 LASYLON 0 DU Y PER SEPOUS AI Fig. 3.

The abandonment of Ugarit around 1200 B.C. was no doubt due to just this invasion of the sea-peoples. II. WRITING IN WESTERN ASIA IN GENERAL AND AT UGARIT IN PARTICULAR Within the above period, the most interesting phase, not only in the history of Ugarit but in that of the Ancient Orient as a whole, is the first half of the fourteenth century. This is what is known as the Amarna Age, from the circumstance that the first insight into its character was afforded by the archives of Amenophis IV, better known as Akhnaten, discovered at Tell el-Amarna (in Egypt). These documents revealed that: Firstly, both this Pharaoh and his predecessor Amenophis III cultivated diplo- matic relations with practically all the independent kings of western Asia and married their daughters. Secondly, their correspondence not only with Babylonia and Assyria but also with the other independent states of west- ern Asia, and even with the Egyptian dependencies in Syria, was conducted in the script and (with very few exceptions to which I shall refer imme- diately) in the language of the Babylonians and Assyrians. The name of that language is Accadian, and for the sake of convenience I shall also refer to its script as Accadian. It was subsequently discovered that the peoples in question had been doing their writing in the Accadian script long before the Amarna Age. However, the leading non-Semitic nations had adapted it to the notation of their own languages at an early date, so that already in the Amarna Age the kings of Arzawa (in Asia Minor) and Mitanni (in northern Mesopotamia) were disregarding the privileges of Accadian as the diplo- matic medium and the convenience of the Egyptian Foreign Office by corresponding with it in their own respective idioms. But with regard to the western Semites, it was believed up to the year 1929 that their written language, even in purely domestic matters, remained Accadian until not long before the end of the second millennium, when writing in the ver- nacular became common among them simultaneously with the use of the Phoenician alphabet. Then came the first season of digging at Ugarit (spring 1929) which brought to light a number of inscribed clay tablets from the Amarna Age; and behold, the great majority of them employed not the very compli- cated Accadian script but a previously unknown one. Upon examination the new system was found to consist of only some thirty simple signs, which obviously represented single sounds rather than syllables or ideograms (signs representing single words or ideas). We shall call it the Ugaritic alphabet. I may say here that to date no specimens of it have turned up at any other site, with two exceptions: 1. In 1933 a clay plaque inscribed with Ugaritic writing in reverse was unearthed at Beth-shemesh, Palestine. Unfortunately, too much of it is missing for any coherent reading. Is it a local product or did some much traveled person bring it to Beth-shemesh from Ugarit? 2. In 1944 a bronze dagger with an inscription in this alpha- bet was discovered near Mt. Tabor, Palestine, and an article on it by 1Mr. S. Yeivin has probably already appeared in the second volume of Kedem, a periodical publication of the Museum of Jewish Antiquities of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem.</page><page sequence="6">46 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST Vol. VIII, Provided the language is known and the material not too limited, and provided that the words are separated from each other-in our texts they are fortunately marked off from each other, as a rule, by a special sign which we call a 'word divider'-such an alphabetic writing is relatively easy to decipher. By adopting the working hypothesis that the language, in view of the location of the find and of the brevity of the words, was akin to Phoenician ( which in turn, as is well known, is closely related to Biblical Hebrew), the German scholar Hans Bauer succeeded in an aston- ishingly short time in identifying half of the letters correctly. That meant that every word which contained only letters from that half was translit- erated by him in a manner which we now know to be correct. Then, with the help of a newspaper article in which Bauer gave a popular presenta- tion of his results, the French savant, Ed. Dhorme, corrected Bauer's identifications of most of the remaining characters, so that he ( )hornme) read nearly every complete word correctly. All this was accomplished despite the fact that the texts on which the decipherers had to work were, unlike some of those discovered in later campaigns, rather crudely written and very fragmentary and for the most part contained only lists.' How was it done? In the observations which the French scholar, Virolleaud, prefaced to his copies of the first texts, he noted that in the first line of one of the tablets. a line which is marked off from the following lines by a horizontal stroke (in the manner in which the headings are fre- quently marked off from the bodies of letters in Accadian writing), a sign which we shall represent by x is followed by a sequence of six signs which also appears on 5 bronze adzes (Fig. 4). From this Virolleaud rightly con- cluded that the tablet in question is a letter, that its initial sign, x, means 'to,' and that the sequence of six signs designates in the letter the addresee. and on the adzes the owner. Now, in Hebrew and Phoenician the single letter that means "to" is 1 and is written together with the following word, so that a large proportion of words in a Hebrew or Phoenician text begin with 1. Bauer observed that similarly a large proportion of words in these new texts began with our x; so apparently x had the value of 1, and the language really was (as he had tentatively assumed) related to Phoenician. In another text was found a word consisting of x flanked on either side by a sign which we shall call y. If x really = 1, then y = sh, for the only Hebrew and Phoenician word consisting of 1 flanked by two identical consonants is the numeral sh(a)-l(o)-sh "three." These identifications were confirmed by the presence in the neighborhood of the word read sh-l-sh of a word sh-sh, evidently equivalent to Hebrew sh(e)-sh "six." A four-letter word in the same vicinity was tentatively read '-r-b-' 'four," and it was noted that the last two letters of it frequently combined with I to produce what was evidently the name of the great Phoenician god b-'-l "Baal." Fur- ther, the first two letters of the word tentatively read '-r-b-' "four" fre- 'The scholar who, by publishing very careful copies of these first texts, made Bauer and Dhorme's contributions to their decipherment possible was the French Assyriologist Ch. Virolleaud. As we shall see in a moment, Virolleaud also discovered the first clue to the decipherment, of which Bauer made grateful use. It was also Virolleaud who was charged with the editing of most of the texts discovered in subsequent campaigns, with whose help he isolated and determined the values of most of the letters which Bauer and Dhorme had failed either to distinguish from others which they resembled or to interpret correctly.</page><page sequence="7">1945,2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 47 quently occurred along with the letter identified above as sh in the combina- tion '-sh-r-z, where s represents still another letter whose value had not yet been determined. Obviously, this combination is the name of the goddess '-sh-r-t, Phoenician 'Ashirt (Biblical Asherah); so that z2 t. The five- letter combination '-sh-t-r-t could now be identified without further ado as the name of the goddess Astarte, Phoenician 'Ashtart (Biblical Ash- toreth). And so on. The working hypothesis that the texts were composed in a language similar to Phoenician soon became an established fact. Fig. 4. Adzes from Ugarit. now in the Louvre Museum, Paris. The one on the right has the inscription "Kharusenni, chief of priests" (hrsn rb khnm). The one on the left is one of four which were found, all of which bore the inscription "chief of priests" (rb khnm). Both inscriptions were written (and therefore are to be read) horizontally, not vertically. (From C. F. A. Schaeffer, Ugaritica I, P1 XXIV) We shall call the Phoenician-like language which was written at Ugarit in the Ugaritic alphabet the Ugaritic language. However, not long after the alphabet had been deciphered it was dis- covered that it was also employed for writing the language of at least one non-Semitic minority of the population of Ugarit; but the material of this</page><page sequence="8">48 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST" Vol. VIII, nature that has come to light is limited in quantity and still very imperfectly understood. On the other hand, the writings in the Ugaritic language pub- lished to date (for a certain amount of material still awaits publication) consist of thousands of lines. Large sections of them are now quite well understood, and at every turn comparison with the Bible is suggested. III. MATERIALS FOR COMPARATIVE BIBLICAL AND UGARITIC STUDIES While, however, it is primarily the Ugaritic texts that are of interest to the student of the Bible, it should be noted that, for obvious reasons, the Ugaritians still employed Accadian in diplomatic correspondence and. maybe out of sheer conservatism, often preferred it as the language of legal documents, business accounts and seals. Most surprising of all, per- haps, are a few Accadian hymns to Mesopotamian deities transcribed in Ugaritic characters and provided with rubrics in the Ugaritic language. The Biblical scholar has much to learn from all these writings too. I shall cite only two cases in point. 1. The Khabiru of the Tell el-Amarna correspondence, who act in co- operation with rebels against the Pharaoh's authority, used to be regularly identified with the Hebrews and adduced as proof that the Israelite con- quest of Palestine took place in the 14th or even in the 15th century. Par- ticularly since the First World War, however, evidence has accumulated to the effect that the word in question (1) is rather to be read Khapiru, (2) was in use all over the Orient in the second millennium B.C., and (3) designated men of any and every nationality. What all the people so desig- nated have in common is that they are economically rootless or broken, just like those who gathered around the outlaws Jephthah (Jud 11:3) and David (1 Sam 22:2) or hired their swords to the usurper Abimelech (Jud 9:4). It is obviously this circumstance, and not racial kinship, that accounts for the analogous roles played by Khapiru in Amarna Age Palestine on the one hand and "vain and light fellows" in early Israel on the other. But the severest blow of all was dealt to the identification of Khapiru with Hebrezws by the discovery at Ugarit of partly parallel Accadian and Uga- ritic lists of towns of the kingdom of Ugarit. For the town which is called "Khalb of the Khapiru" in Accadian is called "Khalb of the 'apirim" (not 'ibriyyinm [="Hebrews"] or the like) in Ugaritic.' 2. That the system of weights in use at Ugarit (Fig. 5) was not the Babylonian one but the one which the Israelites employed is proved not by an Ugaritic document but by a business account in the Accadian lan- guage and by a series of uninscribed balance-weights. The document reck- ons 3,000 shekels to the talent in agreement with Exod 38:25-26 and as against the Babylonian system, which (consistently sexagesimal) reckoned 3,600 shekels. The common balance-weights of Ugarit3 tell the same story. 2To the negative result that the Israelites are not identical with the Khapiru of the Amarna Age, may be added the positive observation that both archaeological and literary indications point rather definitely to the third quarter of the thirteenth century as the date of the Israelite conquest of Palestine. Most of the Ugaritic documents on the other hand, were copied in the second quarter of the fourteenth century; and in the case of literary works, that will usually mean that they were composed considerably earlier. When, therefore, a comparative study of Ugaritic and Biblical litera- ture reveals resemblances which can hardly be accounted for otherwise than by borrowing, it must be the Israelites who borrowed from the Canaanites and not vice versa. 3In addition to the native mina of 470 grammes, the Ugaritians made occasional use of the Egyptian mina of 440 grammes and of the Babylonian mina of 490 grammes. 4See most recently Albright, Annual of the American Schools of Or. Res. XXI-XXII, 1943, pp. 76 ff.--The Palestinian units were heavier than the Ugaritian (11.4 grammes to the shekel as against 9.5 grammes), but their inner relationships were the same (50 shekels to the mina).</page><page sequence="9">1945,2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 49 The largest is evidently a mina (one-sixtieth of a talent) and the others equal one-fiftieth of this mina or multiples or fractions of one-fiftieth. Evidently, therefore, the Ugarit mina was divided into 50 shekels (not into 60 like the Babylonian), so that again a shekel comes to (1/50 x 1/60 ) 1/3,000 of a talent. Interestingly enough the mutual relationships of the uninscribed weights of Judah similarly confirm Exod 38:25-26.4 But let us proceed at last to IV. THE UGARITIC WRITINGS AND THE BIBLE While letters, records of various sorts, a manual on the treatment of horse ailments," and even a schoolboy's exercise are not wanting, the bulk of the Ugaritic writings are literature-or rather, unfortunately, frag- ments of literature-in the strict sense of the word. This literature is ex- clusively poetical, and it is for the most part epic. There are parts of two epics embodying legends about kings and parts of what was probably one great epic embodying myths about gods. There is also one smaller writing which seems to be a ritual text embodying a myth about gods.6 Obviously, such writings are not likely to furnish exact data on his- tory or geography-least of all, in view of the place where they were found, on Palestinian history and geography. Yet that is precisely what was claimed for them by some European scholars during the nineteen- thirties. Some readers of the Biblical Archaeologist have doubtless heard of this "Negebite hypothesis." It asserted that some of the Ugaritic texts preserve the memory of the expulsion of the Phoenicians from their al- leged original homes in an allegedly thriving South of Judah. Their sup- planters were said to be a people bearing the name of Terah, which in the Bible is the name of Abraham's father. The events in question were con- sequently connected with the Abrahamic migration from Mesopotamia to Palestine. South Palestinian localities like Ashdod, Sharuhen, and the wilderness of Kadesh were also said to be named in the texts. However, some of the words in question (e.g., the alleged 'Terah' in some of its oc- curences) are in reality verbs, and others are common nouns. A probable exception is "the wilderness of Kadesh," but we shall see presently that the region thus designated is at least as close to Phoenicia as to Palestine. No, the startlingly prosperous and populous Negeb (south) of the Ugarit texts belongs in the same limbo as the important state of Musri flourishing in the dreary wastes of Sinai and Midian which Hugo Winckler claimed to have discovered in the annals of the kings of Assyria forty-odd years ago, and which he proposed substituting for "Egypt" (Hebrew Misrayim) in large segments of the Bible! What one can expect to learn from the poetical myths and legends of the Ugaritians is something about (1) their ideas and ideals and (2) the technique and quality of their poetry. Then, since in the Amarna Age the Semites of Palestine and the Syrian coast consti- tuted a cultural continuum which may be called "the sphere of Canaanite culture," we may, with due caution, generalize our findings so as to cover the Canaanites of Palestine as well. 5The materia medica includes "old fig-cakes," with which cf. II Ki. 20:7; Isa. 38:21. 6This text is of special interest to Bible students for two reasons. Firstly, a feature of the ritual was the boiling of a kid in milk, so that Maimonides was apparently right in attributing the prohibition of this very practice in Exod. 23:19; 34:26; Deut. 14:21 to its pagan associations. Secondly, apart from Ps. 29:8, this is the only text in or out of the Bible in which "the wilderness of Kadesh" is named. On this, see anon.</page><page sequence="10">50 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST Vol. VIII, 1. IDEAS AND IDEALS To put it tritely, their ideas about men are distinctly more edifying than those about gods. The piety, the loves, and the family life of the hu- man heroes are (always allowing for human frailty) appealing. A good monarch like King Daniel "judges the cause of the widow, adjudicates the case of the fatherless"-a phrase which is familiar to every reader of the Bible. On the other hand King Keret, who is convalescing after a very serious illness, is admonished by his scapegrace son Yassib approximately7 as follows: Hearken, I pray thee O Keret the noble! List, and let thine ear be attentive ... Thou shouldst judge the cause of the widow, adjudicate the case of him that is in anguish of spirit. Thou shouldst deliver the poor man from his oppressors, shouldst feed the fatherless before thee and the widow behind thy back. How long hast thou been a brother of the bed of sickness, a friend of the lofty couch? Descend from the king's throne! Let me be king. Upon the seat of thy dominion let me sit. No doubt the monarchic reality often contrasted luridly with this ideal among the Canaanites, as it notoriously did at times in the Israelite mon- archy. But the ideal was there, and when the Israelites, late in the eleventh century B.C., took over from their neighbors the millennia-old institution of monarchy, they evidently also took over the ideal connected with it.8 For one thing, they almost certainly knew about the legend of King Daniel, the ruler who was not remiss in "judging the cause of the widow, adjudi- cating the case of the fatherless." The prophet Ezekiel (Ezek 14:12 ff.) enunciates the doctrine that, when God visits upon a sinful land a nation- wide calamity, the righteousness of an indivdual dweller of that land can save the life of that individual but not the lives of any of his fellow- citizens, not even those of his own children. To bring his point home, he keeps reiterating that under such circumstances not even Noah, Daniel. and Job would save either a son or a daughter. There can be no doubt that in naming these men, Ezekiel is citing three classical saints of yore. The antiquity of Noah requires no proof. That Job was thought to have lived "in the days of the patriarchs" is evident from certain well known indications in our Book of Job. Between these two, the Daniel of the Book of Daniel, at best Ezekiel's own younger contemporary, is out of place; especially as Ezekiel is obviously illustrating a .eneral proposition, which is applicable to any land, with types of pious men that might con- ceivably be found in any nation. Obviously his Daniel, whom, by the way, he refers to again in another passage (Ezek 28:3), is like Noah and Job, a saint of hoary antiquity, and consequently belongs to mankind as a whole. His identity with the Daniel of the Canaanite epic is highly probable. But the Bible also contains a striking parallel to the son's rebuke of 7The passage in question, II K 6:41-54, was published in Syria XXIII (1942-43) p. 12. Like everything else published in France after 1939, it has remained inaccessible to the scholarly world at large (I only learned of it very recently by a stroke of good luck), and so has not had the benefit of its concerted ingenuity. Consequently, the translation given here probably misses a num- ber of fine points. The general sense, however, is clear. sThat ideal is the origin of the concept of the Messiah, the ideal ruler of "the latter days."</page><page sequence="11">1945,2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 51 Keret, the king who allegedly did not "judge the cause of the widow, decide the case of the fatherless." The opening paragraph of Jeremiah 22, the famous chapter on kings of Judah, reads as follows: Thus saith the Lord, go down unto the house (palace) of the king of Judah and speak there this word. Say, Hearken unto the word of the Lord, O king of Judah that sittest upon the throne of David, thou and all thy servants that enter in by these gates (of the palace). Thus saith the Lord, Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the Fig. 5. Bronze weight from Ugarit, now in the Louvre Museum, Paris. It weighs 190 grammes, which make it 20 Ugaritian shekels. The remarkably lifelike face may possibly be a portrait of the merchant in whose shop it was found-but then again it may not! (From C. F. A. Schaeffer, Ugaritica I, P1. XII) oppressor; and do no wrong, do no violence, to the stranger, nor the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place. For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there (continue to) enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David ... But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the Lord, that this house shall become a desolation. The resemblance of this admonition to the Ugaritic admonition to King Keret is of course not due to imitation, but it is due to the common</page><page sequence="12">52 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST Vol. VIII, premise that a king's job is to execute justice. At the same time, the dif- ference between the two cases should not be overlooked. The story of Keret is legend, that of Jeremiah history. Keret's son was demanding the throne for himself, and his high-sounding sermon was only a hypocritical pretext. But Jeremiah was motivated solely by the intense religious and moral earnestness of a Hebrew prophet. Even if it is granted (though it is very improbable) that the fate of the royal house, and even of the temple, was a matter of indifference to him, that of the nation was surely not; yet in another passage he makes the fulfilment of the same requirements an indispensable condition for the continued existence of both the temple and the nation (ch. 7). Indeed, the Utaritic texts themselves make it difficult to conceive ot a Nathan, an Elijah, an Amos, or a Jeremiah arising in Ugarit, or Byblus, or Tyre, to denounce the failure of their princes to live up to the ideal of the legendary King Daniel. For the example of the human char- acters of Canaanite literature was heavily offset by that of the divine ones. The gods of the Ugaritic epics are not only anthropomorphic (in human form) and anthropopathic (with human emotions), but morally some- times inferior to the genus homo at its best. One of the most shocking examples, and the one most germane to our subject, is that of the ferocious warrior-goddess Anath. King Dan- iel's son Aqhat possesses a cunningly wrought bow, a gift of the crafts- man-god Kothar. Anath coaxes him to give it to her in exchange for wealth or immortality, but Aqhat will on no account part with his bow. Thereupon Anath commissions an assassin to dispatch Aqhat. I do not pretend to be certain that the Phoenician princess Jezebel, who found the same happy solution for the problem of Naboth's unwillingness to sell his vineyard to her husband, the Israelite king Ahab (I Ki. 21), had read this particular story of Aqhat's bow or been told it by her nurse. But it does seem obvious that, other things being equal, a sovereign who had been brought up, like Ahab, in the sternly ethical religion of the Lord of Hosts would be less likely to get such bright ideas, and less ready to act upon them if he did, than one who had been brought up in a milieu where the notions of divinity prevailed which we find in the Canaanite litera- ture. And a monarch who did resort to such practices was infinitely more likely to meet with an Elijah in a society which harbored the Israelite concept of deity than in one that harbored the Canaanite concept. It is indeed fortunate that the Israelites did not borrow any funda- mental ideas about God from the Canaanites! On the other hand, they did borrow, with profit, some subsidiary ones. An example is the notion of His successful combat, long, long ago, with a hydra-headed sea-dragon (Ps. 74:14), known as Leviathan and by several other names and epithets. and with other enlemies. The seven-headed dragon, the very name Levia- than, and most of the other names and epithets recur in the Ugarit texts, according to which the same beings were vanquished by Baal (with the aid of trusty allies). Similarly, the Hebrew poets described Jehovah, just as the Canaanite poets described Baal (Fig. 6), as a storm-god riding in a cloud-enveloped chariot, uttering peals of thunder and sending out darts of lightning; and they even borrowed Baal's epithet of the "Cloudrider" and transferred it to Jehovah.</page><page sequence="13">1945,2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 53 We also have a complete composition, namely Ps. 29, which is full of echoes of Canaanite poetry and whose geographical standpoint is not Palestine but Phoenicia, or at least the Syro-Palestinian "sphere of Ca- naanite culture." It is well known that all of the rainstorms of Syria and Palestine Fig. 6. A bas-relief from Ugarit, now in the Louvre Museum, showing the Canananite weather-god.

Well, our Ps. 29 speaks of such a storm as if it were a ride across the skies by a thundering God. Naturally, His voice is first heard roaring over the "mighty waters" (v. 3). Next, it shatters the cedars</page><page sequence="14">54 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST Vol. VIII, of Lebanon (v. 5). Still further inland, it shakes the Anti-Lebanon range (v. 6). Finally, far to the east, it causes the Syrian Desert to tremble (v. 8). (1) Now, while the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon do lie within the ideal boundaries of the Promised Land (Deut 11:24; Jos 1:4), they do not lie within the historic boundaries of Israel. (2) Furthermore, the name by which the Anti-Lebanon is designated here, namely Sirion (v. 6), is not the usual one. Apart from I Chr. 5:16, where Sirion is per- haps to be read for Sharon, the name only occurs again in the Scriptures in Deut 3:9, which verse states that it is the Sidonian, i. e., Phoenician, name of the range which is otherwise known as Hermon or Senir. And in effect, it is the name employed by Ugaritians and other northern peo- ples. (3) So, too, the great desert to the east of the Anti-Lebanon range, the Syrian Desert, is called in our Psalm "the wilderness of Kadesh,"- a name found nowhere else in the Bible9 but mentioned in a ritual text of Ugarit, where only preconceived notions could have led anybody to take it to refer to a very circumscribed area on the border between the Pales- tinian Negeb (southland) and the Sinai Peninsula. (4) Finally, the cli- mactic ("staircase") parallelism which is so characteristic of our Psalm (vv. 1, 4, 5, 8) is exceedingly common in the Ugaritic poems. And I have already pointed out (5) that the very notion of the storm- riding thunder-god is a Canaanite borrowing. The cumulative evidence for the ultimately Canaanite origin of Ps. 29 is therefore overwhelming, and examples of some shorter pieces of Canaanite verse adapted by the Hebrew poets will be cited presently. How- ever, the procedure of the Israelites with these borrowings was the opposite of that which we observed in connection with the king-ideal; that is to say, they took them less seriously than the Canaanites, more as poetic ornamentation than as fact. (Compare the Puritan Milton's use of Greek mythology even in poems of a specifically theological nature.) For Israel- ite monotheism leaves no room for any powers which are not subject to the sovereign will of God. Consequently it leaves no room for mythology; which is why the Bible contains only a few fossils or erratic boulders of mythology. And it is incompatible with the notion of God's needing to fight; which is why such combats are only introduced for rhetorical or poetic effect, and why "God's enemies" becomes merely a figure of speech for "evildoers." Not only do the two expressions alternate with each other (Ps 68:1-2), but-very characteristically-they alternate with each other in a verse which is unquestionably adapted from a passage in a Canaanite epic that speaks only, and literally, of an enemy. In an Ugaritic text, an ally of Baal encourages him in preparation for an encounter with another god with the words: "Lo, thine enemy O Baal, lo, thine enemy wilt thou smite; lo, thou wilt cut off thine adversary." The Psalmist, on the other hand (Ps 92:9), expresses his confidence in the ultimate triumph of righteous- ness as follows: "For lo, Thine enemies, O Jehovah, lo, Thine enemies "Contrary to an impression which is not confined to adherents of the Negebite hypothesis, none of the wildernesses in the vicinity of Kadesh, or Kadesh-barnea, which admittedly plays an important part in the account of Israel's wanderings prior to her entry into the Promised Land, shares with that oasis the name of Kadesh. That oasis lies between the wilderness of Zin and the wil- derness of Paran. (See Wright-Filson, Westminster Historical Atlas to the Bible [1945], Pls. V, X.) Indeed, in view of Gen. 14:7 it is doubtful whether even the oasis was called Kadesh at the time when the Ugarit texts were written.</page><page sequence="15">1945,2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 55 shall perish; all they that work iniquity shall be scattered." This example, however, illustrates not only the ideas of the Canaanites as revealed by the Ugaritic texts and Israel's reaction to them, but also the 2. FORM AND QUALITY OF CANAANITE POETRY and its influence upon Israelite poetry. And indeed, the most important and assured results of comparative Biblical and Ugaritic studies come under this heading. The formal elements of Hebrew poetry are largely borrowed from the Canaanites. I have already mentioned that climactic parallelism is a favorite device of Canaanite poets. The Ugaritic passage I have just translated is an example-as is also, of course, its Biblical modification. That the same kind of climactic parallelism also occurs in Fig. 7. A view from the Lebanon mountains, looking down to the coast and the Mediterranean Sea. The city in the distance is the modern capital of Lebanon, Beirut, over 100 miles south of Ugarit. (Oriental Institute, University of Chicago) early Accadian poetry is beside the point. The Canaanites, whose written language, as we have seen, was originally Accadian, doubtless adopted this and other techniques from Accadian poetry. But that was long be- fore the Israelites appeared upon the scene, and the latter could only have borrowed those techniques from the Canaanites. Moreover, for the de- termination of mutual relationships, the frequency of a feature is at least as important as its mere presence. The well known parallelism of clauses is present in a certain measure in the poetry of many ancient and modern peoples. (It is very prominent, for example, in the national epic of the Finns !) But in the Ancient Orient, it is only in Canaanite poetry that its</page><page sequence="16">56 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAJEOLOGIST Vol. VIII, use attains the same, sometimes monotonous, regularity as in Hebrew. In order to meet the exigencies of such a prosody, the Canaanite and Hebrew poets have some fixed pairs of synonymous words or phrases for certain concepts which poets have frequent occasion to express (e. g.: head, eternity, to fear, to rejoice). Many such fixed pairs are common to Uga- ritic and Biblical poetry (though of course the words were not pronounced exactly alike in the two languages). Moreover, the members of such a pair are-with apparently no exceptions in Ugaritic poetry and with very few in Hebrew-always employed in the same order, and that order is also nearly always the same in both literatures. Common to both is the rule that it is the more usual expression that comes first, the second in some cases being hardly used at all except precisely for the purpose of balancing the first. For example, the ordinary Hebrew word for "eternity" is 'olaml (or 'olamini.), and if the poet wishes to express this concept a second time in a parallel clause he uses "generation and generation," dor wa-dor (or dor dor, or dor doriin). And except for the pronunciation, it is the same in Ugaritic. Thus, the continuation of the encouragement of Baal which I quoted above is, literally: "Thou wilt win thy kingdom of eternity ('lin = Heb. 'olami), thy dominion of all generations (dr dr = Heb. dor dor) ;" with which compare (Ps. 145:13): "Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all eternity ('olamim), and Thy dominion endureth through all generations (dor wa-dor)." I need not point out that the importance of this illustration is not lim- ited to the use, in the same sequence, of the same pair of synonyms for "eternity"! Our verse, like Ps. 92:9 which I quoted above, is obviously borrowed and adapted from its Canaanite parallel. But to return to the identical use of fixed pairs of parallel synonyms, such agreement goes beyond a mere agreement of form and results in a considerable similarity of diction. So great, in fact, is the agreement in poetic diction that the Ugarit texts have become-in absolute terms to a very modest extent, but in relation to their limited bulk to a surprisingly large extent--an aid to the texrtual criticism of poetical passages in the Hebrew Bible; sometimes confirming emendations previously proposed, sometimes suggesting convincing new ones. For example, Ps. 42:2a is rendered in both the Authorized and the Revised Version: "As a hart panteth after the water brooks." However, "hart" is masculine, whereas the verb rendered "panteth" is feminine in form in the Hebrew. Now, all that is necessary for changing the Hebrew word for "hart" into the word for "hind" is the addition of a final t; and as the following word begins with a t, scholars have long suspected that, as frequently happens, our "hart" is simply due to the failure of a scribe to write the t twice (at the end of the substantive as well as at the beginning of the following verb) instead of only once. It so happens that the same figure of speech occurs in an Ugaritic passage, and there the feminine form of our substantive (i. e., with final t) is employed, thus confirming the proposed emendation in the Psalms passage. So, too, an Ugaritic parallel to II Sam 1:21 shows that instead of u-sde terumot "nor fields of offerings"-which no serious exegete regards otherwise than as a makeshift translation-e-shera' tehomiot "nor upwelling of the deeps" (i. e., flowing of springs) is to be</page><page sequence="17">1945,2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 57 read. Again, in Job 37:3 the rendering "He sendeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth" is unsatisfactory for three reasons: firstly, because a mere pronoun "it" stands in parallelism to a substantive "lightning"; secondly, because "it" does not mean "light- ning" but refers back to the "sound" (i. e., "thunder") of the preceding verse; and thirdly, because the verb rendered "sendeth" does not have that meaning anywhere else in Hebrew or in the related idioms. However, the observation that a substantive from the same root means in Ugaritic "a flash of lightning" suggests that we have here an example of the opposite error from that which we have just noted in Ps. 42:1; i. e., the scribe Fig. 8. The Plain of Antioch, some fifty miles northeast of Ugarit. St. Paul and many other Christians of the early Church crossed this plain on their way from Antioch to Tarsus and other cities in Asia Minor via the pass through the mountains to be seen in the center background. Here was the scene also of pre-Christian activities and cities. The mound in the foreground is now called Tell-ej-Judeideh, first settled in the sixth or fifth millennium B. C. It has been excavated by the Oriental Institute and is the key to unlocking the early history of Syria. In the right center of the photograph may be seen another mound, called Chatal Huyuk, also excavated by the Oriental Institute. Both of these sites were occupied in the early Christian period. A small church, dating from the sixth century A.D., was found among the surface ruins of the former. (Oriental Institute, University of Chicago) has repeated at the end of the verb the w with which the following word begins. With this final w omitted, the word reads instead of vishrehu "he sendeth(?) it"-yisre(h) "he flasheth"; and in a flash, all three of our difficulties are solved. (Probably Sarai, the original name of Abraham's wife Sarah, is from the same root and means "brilliance.") A fourth example is Prov. 26:23, in which a person with smooth lips but a bitter heart is compared, as our text now reads, to "an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross." Apart from the question as to what exactly "silver dross" is, the Hebrew expression means rather "dross silver"-which</page><page sequence="18">58 THE BIBLICAL ARCHA4EOLOGIST is not much easier to define. Moreover, neither "silver d(ross" nor "dross silver" is used for plating earthenware in real life and, what is more serious, neither would form a particularly attractive exterior. However, if the two Hebrew words in question (ksp sygym) are written together, i. e., as kspsygym, the intial k can be taken as the particle meaning "like," while the rest of the word can be identified with Ugaritic spsg "quartz, glaze." And "an earthen vessel overlade with glaze" is exactly what the context requires."1 The last three examples illustrate, besides the value of Ugaritic litera- ture for the textual criticism of the Hebrew Scriptures, its contribution to Hebrew lexicography. Under this heading may also be included the con- firmation which it affords for the surmise, previously made by an American scholar on the basis of the Arabic, that the verb rendered "to be dismayed" in Isa. 41:10, 23 is not the hithpael of sha'ah "to look" but an independent verb shata' "to be dismayed," as also its testimony that the Hebrew word for "table" does not mean properly "a skin mat," nor the word for "win- dow" "a hollow." In general, the number of Hebrew words whose meanings have been correctly understood but whose etymologies will have to be revised in view of their Ugaritic correspondences is surprisingly high. I have yet to say a word about the quality of Uaaritic poetry. After what I have already hinted about the crudity of the Canaanite concept of divinity, it will come as no surprise that some of the passages are quite crude, and that few display real power or profundity. However, some- especially those about men !-are not without delicacy and grace. But there can be no two opinions about it: the Israelite pupils far outstripped their Canaanite masters. I would add, however, that the purpose of comparative studies is not invidious comparison, but better understanding. The literature, archaeol- ogy, history, and individuality of Israel, the world it lived in, and its place in that world and in history, have all been clarified in varying degrees by the discoxeries made at Ugarit, and will undoubtedly be further clarified by further study and discovery.
