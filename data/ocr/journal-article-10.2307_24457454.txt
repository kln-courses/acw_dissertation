<plain_text><page sequence="1">VASILY VAStLYEVICH ROZANOV JESUS AND THE SOUR FRUITS OF THE WORLD I hose same themes which disturbed the "Religious-Philosophical Meet ings" of 1902-19031 are being raised in meetings today. Those questions about the spirit and the flesh, "Christian community" and society in the broad sense; about the relationship of the Church and art; marriage and virginity; the Gospel and paganism; and so on and so on. In his bril liant paper, "Gogol and Father Matvey," D. S. Merezhkovsky has urgently raised the question of the relationship of Christianity to art, especially the relationship, for example, of Orthodoxy to the character of Gogol's work. In contrast with Father Matvey, Gogol's famous spiritual counselor, he thinks that the Gospel is compatible with sweet devotion to the muses, that it is possible to listen to the preaching of Father Matvey and to V. V. Rozanov (1856-1918) was a major figure in the Russian religious revival of the early years of the century. There is a good analysis of his work in Zen kovsky's History of Russian Philosophy, Vol. 1, Ch. 11 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1953). The present selection was printed in Tenny Lik ("The Dark Image") 1911, and appeared in Rozanov Izbrannoe (New York: Chekhov Publishing House, 1956, pp. 95-108). The translation used here is taken from a forthcoming book, Ultimate Questions: An Anthology of Modern Russian Religious Thought, edited by Father Alexander Schmemann, Dean of St. Vladi mir's Orthodox Seminary, Tuckahoe, N.Y. Copyright © 1965 by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. Reprinted with the permission of Holt, Rinehart and Winston. In his introduction Father Schmemann quotes Mirsky's History of Russian Literature: "Dostoevsky . . . for the profundity, complexity, and significance of his religious experience, has only two possible rivals in the whole range of Rus sian literature—Rozanov and, of course, Tolstoy," Schmemann emphasizes the contradictory aspects of Rozanov: "He combined an almost physical attachment to the Church, its clergy, its liturgy and customs, with the most violent criticism of Christianity; a love for the Old Testament with vulgar anti-Semitism; a unique literary gift with journalistic cynicism. . . . He wrote on many subjects—culture, history, sex, literature—but there can be no doubt that the heart of all his suf fering and intuition was a tremendously real experience of God—but an expe rience radically opposed to an equally real experience of the world. He could not reconcile the truth of God, whom he personally loved, with the truth of the world. Hence the complexity of his writings, which are deeply religious even when fighting religion." The present essay is an effective introduction to Rozanov's contradictory genius and a striking challenge to those who prefer to believe that the question of harmonizing Christianity and culture has been smoothly and finally resolved.</page><page sequence="2">read and reread The Inspector and Dead Souls, heartily laughing at the characters there. The pathos of Dmitry Sergeyevich, at least at that mo ment, was in the idea of the compatibility of the Gospel with all that man has loved so much in the thousands of years of his culture. The reverend fathers, even the higher clergy, and all the secular theologians backed him up, nodding in agreement that "of course the Gospel is in harmony with everything high and noble"; that it is "cultural"; and therefore culture and the Church, clergy and writers can sit down "har moniously" at one table, carry on nice conversations with one another, and sip out of the same pot of tasty tea. All this was extraordinarily nice, and in the highest degree tranquilizing. Servetus in Geneva and Savo narola in Florence, both burned at the stake, could not raise their voices in our disputes. On the other hand, the "Union of the Russian People" had not yet started its activities. We were debating this in 1902, for getting the past and not foreseeing the future, surrendering ourselves to the sweet moment. It seems to me that the question is resolved with the help of mental inlays. If one were to put into the Gospel a piece of Gogol's prose, the most well-intended piece, directed, so to speak, toward the best possible goal, then we would get a murderously unbearable cacophony, stemming not just from the dissimilarity of the human and the divine, of the weak and the strong, but from the fact that there are two categories here. Not only is it impossible to put a piece of Gogol into the Gospels, but also into any of the apostolic epistles. Saul was not gradually brought up to be Paul, he was converted into Paul; he did not add a new kernel to his rabbinical wisdom—not even a whole new ear—in the form of faith in Christ. No, he vomited up his rabbinic tradition. The relationship with in him was Saul vs. Paul: each "I" devouring the other. And this happens with anyone who has turned to Christ; the old devours the new. The apostle Paul certainly did not propose to the Athenians that they "be lieve in Christ and at the same time go to the Olympic games." In mo ments of rest—any kind of rest, for a day, for an hour—he did not enter the Greek theater to see a tragedy. We know for sure, by a subtle feeling for psychological nuances, that this is not only not mentioned in "Acts," but simply could not have been. Paul in the theater—an impossible scenel Acclaiming the play of the actors—cacophony! the destruction of all Christianity! And yet this would only be the same "reconciliation" and "harmony" for which D. S. Merezhkovsky is pleading. Yes, Paul labored, ate, smelled, walked about, lived in the material conditions of life; but he had made a profound break with them, since he no longer loved or admired anything in them. He took matter only as something necessary and utilitarian, he knew and felt the need of only what was prose to the flesh. Christ was the one flower of the flesh, a mono-flower, if one may put it that way. "I walk, eat, sleep, taste; but I am satisfied only by Christ" is something every real Christian can say about himself. 34 CROSS CURRENTS: WINTER 1965</page><page sequence="3">Christ never laughed. Isn't it obvious that all Gogol's laughing was culpable in him insofar as he was a Christian? I don't remember if Christ smiled or not. But the imprint of sorrow, of consuming sorrow, is obvious in the Gospel. There are joys in it too, but completely different, sche matic, heavenly joys; joys coming from an immeasurable height above the earth and mankind. Let's not be deceived by the "lilies of the field." In any case, this is not botany, or gardening, or science, or poetry, but only a design, a scheme, a smile at the earth. The point is that the Gospel isn't an earthy book, and everything earthy is extremely hard to connect or is simply not connected with it; or if connected, then arti ficially and temporarily. I shall permit myself a little parallel. Words buzz past our ears; "Christian marriage," "the Christian family," "Christian children." What an illusion! Of course there never was such a thing and there never will be before the end of time! I suggested that you make an inlay of Gogol in the Gospel, and you got a cacophony. I now propose that you imagine one of the young wives of the Gospel, or any of the apostles (excuse my temerity) as being in love. I ask to be excused, and indeed you feel that I ought to ask to be excused. Why? Because of the complete incompatibility of physical love and the Gospel. I have not read Renan's Life of Jesus, but I have repeatedly heard, in words of pro found indignation, that the temerity of this French freethinker went so far that he depicted one of the Gospel's figures as being in love. The taste of the whole world, of all the throngs of readers of the Gospel, sensed in this the deepest sacrilege against divine nature. This is the same question as the one about Father Matvey and Gogol. It is only another instance. But the apostles, including Peter and Paul, were married. Yes, but then in a kind of special, gospel marriage. The example I have indi cated is not an empty one even in a practical matter. The Church permits its priests to marry, but to marry anyone and right now, without court ship or the attraction of love; i.e., everything is arranged in their marriage so that the groom cannot and must not be in love with his bride, any more than an officer is with a soldier. The relations of officer and soldier are preserved, but there's no love. The relations of husband and wife are preserved in Christianity, but love—out of which one would have thought that marriage is born—is passed over in sepulchral, even inten tional, fatal, darkling silence. There is no laughing or physical love in the Gospel, and one drop of either would reduce all the pages of this wondrous book to ashes, would "tear asunder the curtains" of Christian ity. Yes, the "dead" were restored when Christ died; but on the other hand the mysterious "curtain of Solomon's temple" was "torn asunder" . . . and didn't the "law" of this "temple"2 state, in the meantime, that it was forbidden to use, either as an instrument in its making or as a part of it, the smallest scrap of iron, since "weapons come from iron, and weapons shorten life."3 Consequently the mysterious meaning of the tem VASILY VASILYEVICH ROZANOV 35</page><page sequence="4">pie is the "lengthening of life." But let us leave these and a host of other observations. Let us turn to our special theme. Neither Gogol nor literature in general, as a game, as a frolic, a smile, a graciousness, as the flower of human everyday life, is in any way com patible with the mono-flower, "sweetest Jesus." What about the world then? I cry out with Merezhkovsky. What about us, in the flower and joy of our life? Everything that the religious people said then, on the occasion of D. S. Merezhkovsky's paper, for instance that they "would go to the theater if the theater were better," was evasive and really stemmed from the need to say something when they obviously could not say nothing. Yes, of course, if actors were to come out on the theater's boards and begin to bellow about their godliness, then the gentlemen bishops would have gone to such a spectacle with pleasure. But suggest that the rather inno cent song "In the Meadows" be played for them on the flute, and they will refuse. It is not sinful pleasures that are forbidden to them, but pleasures as such. All that is not sorrowful is not permitted for them. Wine, tea, fine fish, jam, fine apartments, and furniture—are really smug gled in to them like contraband. But officially, under the law, under the "Church's regulations," it is definitely impossible to say: "A bishop can indulge himself with a fine table of fish." He must eat only dried mush rooms—this is what can be said officially. In saying this I am distinguish ing the legal merchandise from the contraband within Christianity. The arts, the muses, Gogol, a fine table, and jam are all smuggled into the Christian world as contraband. "This is permissible"; but nobody adds "this is convenient" (the formula of the apostle Paul), and yet this addi tion contains the whole point, all of poetry, the little flower—which the mono-flower, Jesus, definitely does not allow. Christianity and the Gospel have carried out a really endless extension of their embrace—I was about to say, of their clutch. Christianity has let down the broad mouth of its net on eternity, but this is only something "permissible," it is really just the expression of its own goodness, con descension, and forgiveness. It even "forgives" Gogol, you see, and Push kin, and jam . . . even the adultress and adultery; without which, inci dentally, all the saints—beginning with blessed Augustine, who experi enced such a stormy youth—would not have fallen into the net. But for giveness is not at all the same as summons. Christians are summoned to one thing only—to love Christ. Of course Gogol and all his work (with out any interruption whatever) could be "saved." But there are different kinds of salvation: there are heroes of salvation, there are great ones in Christianity, there is a poetry of Christian salvation, in its own way a kind of spiritual romance. Only martyrs have passed as heroes, and Gogol became, and had to become, a martyr in order to enter into the romance and poetry of Christianity. The point is that an action, an effort, a jump, a game—either in the 36 CROSS CURRENTS: WINTER 1965</page><page sequence="5">sphere of art or of literature—or laughter, or pride, etc., is impossible from the Christian point of view. In general, jam is permitted; but not too tasty . . . better if it be spoiled, or still better—that there be no jam at all. But if there is jam, and tasty jam at that, well then it's forgiven . . . the possibility of Christian breadth is based on this. By means of the net of "forgiveness," of goodness, of condescension, Christianity has em braced a whole abyss of quite unnecessary, and in its own eyes, worthless articles. It has seized the "prince of this world" and dragged him off to a diminution. Christianity is the religion of a descending progression, eter nally striving toward, but never attaining, the quantity "Christ plus some thing," Christ plus wealth, Christ plus glory, Christ plus the com forts of life. This "something" added to Christianity has always been simply condenscended to, and diminished in our souls in proportion to the ascendancy of Christ. The "prince of this world" has melted away near the Christ-sun like a snowball, like a snowman in spring. Really what has been left for Christians is an outline of the "prince of this world," of family, literature, and art. The nerve has been drawn out of it all—a doll remains, not a living being. As soon as you try to enliven the family, art, and literature, as soon as you surrender yourself to anything "heart and soul," you immediately begin the fatal exit from Christianity. Hence Father Matvey's yelling at Gogol. It wasn't that Gogol was working in the field of literature. Let him work. But the jam had to be sour. Gogol was working passionately in the field of literature, and this was forbidden! A monk may commit adultery with a young lady; a monk may have a child; but the child must be thrown into the river. The minute the monk clings to the child and says "I won't let him go"; the minute he clings to the young lady and say "I love her and will not stop loving her"—Christianity is ended. As soon as the family becomes serious, Christianity suddenly turns into a joke; as soon as Christianity becomes serious, the family, literature, and art turn into a joke. They all exist, but not in their true form. They all exist, but without an ideal. What about it? Where is there a place for all this? D. S. Merezhkovsky is indignant over the grey or variegated aspect of Christianity, its striation; a black strip, a white strip; affliction—but not eternal; monasteries and fasts—but set in the midst of a lovely landscape. One can write an ode— "Reflections on the Majesty of God While Viewing the Northern Lights" —but it's a sin to write "The Bronze Horseman." But what is the pure black color? It is death, the grave, about which I have spoken in one of my previous papers and which can definitely not be torn away from Christianity. This is its backbone and four legs. It goes forward by way of the "grave," it is created on the grave. What is the pure white color? The Hellene and the Jew revivified, Egypt revivified. All three in a re splendent new embodiment, with various modern nuances, but in essence the same. The dancer before the Ark of the Covenant; "Sing praises to the Lord upon the harp," as Judith said. The Hellene is the tranquil, undis VASILY VASILYEVICH ROZANOV 37</page><page sequence="6">turbed Jew, the Jew without depth. The Jew is the yolk of that Easter egg whose shell and white are hellenism; a decorated literary shell, with the inscription "Christ has risen," with figures, painting, the arts, the whole of hellenistic civilization. But while the shell with all its inscrip tions is strong, the white is poorly nourished and has not grown. The most important thing is the yolk hidden within and the embryonic spot on that yolk. I return to the details of D. S. Merezhkovsky's paper. God does not have just one child—-Jesus—but two: the world and Jesus. The world is the child of God because it was created by Him. Like a fragment in pro portion to its existence, Gogol too exists in the world, and poetry, play, games, graciousness, the family, the Hellene, the Jew, and all of paganism. All this is the kingdom of God the Father and the product of His gen erative power. It was not all at once, not in the Apostolic Age, but later, two or three hundred years after Christ, that the Church began to won der "What about the world?" and clarified, was compelled to clarify the fact that the "Son of God" is Jesus, "Who stands in the shadow and like ness of the Father." But the Church only named the Father, not being in any position to imagine Him; if she depicted Him in the form of an old man she fell into obvious anthropomorphism. "No one has ever seen God" are the words of the New Testament; "It is impossible to see Me and not die" God said about Himself to Moses. Christian teachers see, and always have seen, part of the Scriptures; never, it seems, have they taken all of it into consideration. And in general all the Church's concepts are constructed as if in a dream: here you'll find rabid spiritualism, the coars est anthropomorphism, and even fetishism. Everything has found a place in her eclectic, "variegated" building. Into this Fatherly Hypostasis (de fined only numerically), the world enters with its radiancy, its ideals, com edies, tragedies, with its common everyday life; the world is by its phy sical nature holy, holy not, however, in the physical nature of the Son, but by its procession out of the physical nature of the Father. Thus in the realm of Jesusism, Merezhkovsky's question has found no response whatever—or receives a sharply negative response—while in the realm of the trihypostatic confession of the Church the question finds a full and satisfactory revolution. But the Church herself has done nothing about the Father, beyond her anthropomorphic and sinfully artistic representations, other than her issuing of a kind of "license of residence." It is true that she says "Creator of the world" and "Providence." But these are abstract predicates. The Jews also have prayed to the Creator of the world and to Providence, calling Him by their own never actually pronounced name—as have the Egyptians and Babylonians. Generally speaking, every people has always known the Creator of the world and Providence, and in acknowledging the "Fatherly Hypostasis," the Church's teachers unconsciously acknowledged, in fact, the whole pagan world. If this had happened three centuries earlier the apostle Paul 38 CROSS CURRENTS: WINTER 1965</page><page sequence="7">would have had nothing to fight against. His struggle, from the loftiest points of view of the Church herself, is foolishness. There were no real reasons for his conversion from Saul into Paul, for the shaking of Sinai, for his becoming a despised blot on Olympus and the Capitoline, where the true being of God was being worshiped under lesser, incorrect names, where they were glorifying the holy Creator in His Holy creations. But the historical enigma consists precisely in the fact that there was a Saul and later a Paul, and not just a Paul who added the knowledge of Christ to his rabbinical wisdom. It will always be a mystery: Why did Nico demus not accept Christ? Why did Gamaliel not accept Him, and in general all those kind Jews who were really wholly Christian in heart, in character, and in everyday life? They have said nothing about this and have hidden the greatest mystery of the world in silence. If they had spoken about it there would have been no clash between Father Mat vey and Gogol. There would have been no Inquisition, there would have been no destruction by the Inquisition of the Incas and Peruvians. The Jesuit order with its "secrets" would never have arisen, an order fanatical to the point of madness and given to lying like "forty thousand brothers," to use Shakespeare's expression.4 The point is, are the children of God—the World-Child and the Jesus Child—in harmony? This is the question to which Merezhkovsky's paper leads us. I do not know how to answer this question, and it cannot be answered without detailed research, examination, and comparison. The world had fallen apart—and the Gospel fell into it. The world accepted it, accepted it with love. The Gospel was inlayed into the world. But Gogol does not enter the Gospel as an inlay; love, physical love, is not to be inlayed in the Gospel. And in general the Gospel does not open itself up for the world, does not accept it into itself. The world stands beyond the binding of the heavenly book. The world's ruddy glow departs, it pales as soon as it comes close to this binding. Here I recall the Pale Horseman5 of the Apocalypse, but right now I'm unable to re member exactly what he signifies. We cannot resolve Merezhkovsky's ques tion but can only lay the groundwork for its resolution. As far as I can tell, listening here to the religious gentlemen, they do not have any metaphysics of Christianity, let alone a true one. Christian ity simply appears to them as something good. "We are good people and do not understand what you want of us"; this is the sense of all their replies to the world's perplexity. When reproaches sound, they say, "We are humble people and we admit our errors," and a smile of satisfaction almost spreads across their faces. It is impossible to shake their position of virtue. "We firmly confess the most virtuous faith and are ourselves virtuous to the point of humility and the admission of our sins, the most exquisite state which man can attain." In the meantime, secular perplex ity rolls round inside the hoop of metaphysics. Religion simply as vir tue, as summa virtutum, seems impossible to us as people of the world. VASILY VASILYEVICH ROZANOV 39</page><page sequence="8">Religion is a mystery, a mysterious design of steely hardness, with not a bit of flexibility in it. We would prefer that the religious people would thunder with indignation and anathemas, then we'd see the borderline between ourselves and them, something we definitely do not see now. "What the devil, we're good people too ... I, Merezhkovsky, and the others." In the indignation of the religious people we would see what they love—and we'd rush to analyze, inspect, and perhaps even love this thing beloved by them. "Christianity is the grave and death" we say to them. "What are you talking about? Absolutely not!" they answer. Why, we sympathize with every joy!" Well then, go to the theater, if only to Boris Godunov—a patriotic work, or to Life with the Tsar, even more so. Passing over Godunov and Glinka in silence, they say "The theater is insufficiently serious." Yes, but what about the fact that the Alexander Nevsky Monastery has granaries, while trading was forbidden by the Saviour? They let this one go by, or say instead, "But look here, Christ did not estrange Himself from the land, He ate with the publicans and sinners." "Then go to the opera." We can't, it's vulgar." But it isn't that it's vulgar, it's because it's fun. It's just that their "regulations" don't permit them anything that is fun, or happy. Fun and happiness are the negation of death, a forgetting of the coffin. The family and art are the decorations of life. Even the coffin is sometimes decorated with trim mings, with little silver handles. These lovely landscapes around the mon asteries are just like the little silver handles around the coffin. Merezh kovsky's paper, coming after my paper on death as the main ideal of Christianity, raises the question a second time: "What is Christianity?" And it is definitely impossible to answer this by saying, "We are good people." It is necessary instead to answer metaphysically and with dem onstrations. It seems to me that we should set aside one meeting to hear the clergy's answers to this question, not their eloquent and well-turned, nor their moral and evasive answers, but just indignant and even anathe matizing answers, which reply directly to the question. For our ignor ance is painful. It hurts. As an aid to future discussions I shall allow myself a little personal conjecture, by no means dogmatic. Jesus is certainly more beautiful than anything in the world or even the world itself. When He appeared, then like the sun, He dimmed the stars. Stars are needed at night. The stars are science, family, art. It cannot be denied that the Face of Christ de picted in the Gospel—at least as we have read about Him and as we have understood Him—is "sweeter" and more attractive than family, or king doms, or power, or wealth. Gogol is a straw before the chief of the evan gelists. So if there is a death in Christ, then it is a sweet death, a death weariness. Hermits, of course, have their delights too. They die from weariness, renouncing every world. Let us pass on to the phenomena of the world. Since the birth of Christ, since the shining forth of the Gos pel, all the fruits of the earth have suddenly become sour. The world 40 CROSS CURRENTS: WINTER 1965</page><page sequence="9">has become sour in Christ, precisely as a result of His sweetness. As soon as you have tasted the sweetest, most unheard-of, genuinely heavenly bread—you lose the taste for ordinary bread. Who wants a potato after eating a pineapple? This is the essence of idealism in general, of the ideal, of the greatest thing. Great beauty makes us immune to ordinary beauty. Everything is "ordinary" in comparison with Christ. Not just Gogol but also literature in general, science in general. Still further, the whole world and everything, be it ever so mysterious, ever so interesting, yields to Christ precisely in the area of sweetness. When His extraordinary beauty enlightened the world, then the most sensitive being in the world, man, lost his taste for the world that surrounded him. The world simply be came sour, flat, boring. This is the main consequence proceeding from the coming of Christ. Let us draw a little parallel. We would study all the princes of the Middle Ages if it hadn't been for Charlemagne. If it had not been for the El Ladhi we perhaps might have studied, in the most careful way, the history of the various Mongol tribes. We would be at tentive to the small and the ugly. But when there is something great at hand, what interest can there be in something small? Thus the world began to sink around Jesus. A general inundation of former ideal things began. This inundation is also called Christianity. The gods, Jehovahs, and Dianas sank; the relative ideals of man sank before the universal ideal of heaven. You must see that you can surrender yourself to the arts, family, politics, and science only by not looking attentively at Jesus. Gogol looked attentively at Christ—and threw down his pen and died. And to the extent that it looks attentively at Jesus the whole world throws down its work, whatever it is, and dies. "It is impossible for you to see Me and not die," God said to Moses. The young man from Sais looked at the "being of God" and died. In general death and knowledge of God are somehow mutually inclusive. God is not the world. And as soon as you glance at God you have begun to "pass out of the world," have begun to "die." I have observed that the tone of the Gospel is sor rowful, melancholy, "funereal." But sorrow is loftier than joy, more ideal. Tragedy is loftier than comedy. We are all good people now; but we'll become excellent people in the world of sadness, when we have lost our wives, our children. A beggar is more beautiful than a millionaire; and poets bring beggars into their descriptions. But who ever described a mil lionaire? He's a subject of satire. So one of the great enigmas of the world is the fact that suffering is more ideal, more aesthetic, than happiness more sorrowful, more majestic. We are incredibly attracted to the sorrow ful. Doesn't the secret of the religious sacrifice of children to God lie here? the never-explained secret of Moloch? People survived heavenly sorrow and sought to experience it; they sacrificed all for it, even the chief thing. A "death before death" . . . Moloch! Let us turn to our particular question. Isn't the universal burial of the world in Christ the most aesthetic event, the high point of worldly VASILY VAS1LYEVICH ROZANOV 41</page><page sequence="10">beauty? Gogol cannot be inlayed into the Gospel; he cannot, therefore, be introduced into Christianity; he must simply be tossed out. Not from the earthly point of view, but precisely from the monastic viewpoint, as a sweet reconciliation with Christ. This is what is delaying the end of the world. All history in general, everyday life, songs, literature, the fam ily, are impediments (but already weak impediments) to the burning up of all things in a Christ-death. Death; here is the loftiest affliction and the loftiest sweetness. However, nobody has discovered the secret of death. It crowns afflictions, but there is the weariness of a mysterious aesthetic in these afflictions. The tragedy of tragedies. From this point of view, Christ is a Tragic Person, as He has always revealed Himself to man. We don't know what the whole of Divinity is, and don't know it precisely to the extent that we are still alive, since life is the "other," the "re verse" side of God. People are trying to identify death with birth. It's possible. But why, for instance, is birth not identical with death? When a man is born in reality he dies; his mother's belly is a tomb; my very conception is a move into death. But the point is that "here" and "there" are divided by a chasm, like "down" and "up," "external" and "internal." And however much you make them the same, whatever term, whatever sign you use, one term must exclude the other. "The world," "existence," "our life," are not divine. Or vice versa, "the world," "existence," "our life," are divine; and then "the grave," "the afterlife," "the world to come," are demonic. But obviously Jesus is that "world to come" which is vanquishing "this world," our world, and has already vanquished it. And out of either series of equally possible predicates for this world you make a choice according to your own best judgment. The Church has always considered Christ as God, and eo ipso has been compelled to consider the whole world, our life, birth itself (not to mention the sciences and arts), as demonic, "lying in sin." And this is the way she has behaved toward them. Not that anything has to be improved, but simply that everything must be done away with.

Merezhkovsky in 1901, and brought about a major encounter between the intellectuals and the church. 2 In Ezekiel's vision of the mysterious temple such terms are used as: "it is necessary to know the law of the temple that is being built," "to know the law of the sacrificial altar within it," i.e., the principle, the essence, the hidden idea both of the temple and the altar.
