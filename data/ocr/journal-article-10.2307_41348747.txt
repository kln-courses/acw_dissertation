<plain_text><page sequence="1">Heavenly Healing: Eschatological Cleansing and the Resurrection of the Dead in the Early Church Candida R. Moss* This paper uses constructions of the resurrected body in the early church as a lens through which to consider the roles of bodily ability and difference as identity markers in the study of religious texts. It argues that with the emergence of "orthodox" views of bodily resurrec- tion and the encounter with the objections of Greek philosophy, the perfect resurrected body began to be described using the language of healing and cleansing. By examining constructions of resurrected bodies in the writings of Pseudo- Justin, Irenaeus, and Augustine, it argues that - unlike gender - certain bodily impairments are not reproduced in the resurrection. Their removal is tied to a particular view of salvation history and functions both as the completion of Jesus' healing ministry and as proof of the removal of primordial sin. The salvation of all flesh is completed with the eradication of bodily "deformity." How are the dead raised ? With what kind of body do they come ? 1 Corinthians 15:3s1 IN RAVENNA, ITALY, the church of Sanť Apollinare Nuovo pre- serves a sixth-century mural of saints in procession. The female ^Candida R.

The women gaze blankly toward the congregation, their identical expressions reflecting a characterless homogeneity otherwise understood as the blissful serenity of sainthood. Above their heads the names of the martyrs- Justina, Perpetua, and Felicity - serve as the only markers of their individual identities.2 Save these ancient name-tags, there is no other way to distinguish between the martyrs; they are all pale, expressionless, and light- haired. According to the traditional view, in life Perpetua was a Tunisian aristocrat turned transgendered gladiator, and Felicity, a slave girl.3 In death they are memorialized as heavenly "Stepford wives," their complexions washed out with Roman notions of pale aristocratic beauty.4 The iconographie representation of the heavenly saints is common- place in ancient art. They are marked with crowns of wreaths and palm branches as athletic martyrs. Their identical clothing removes the mark- ings of social status and class that accompanied them in life. The uni- formity and neatness of their revivified heavenly bodies represent the perfection and order of heaven itself.5 The symmetry and proportional- ity of the heavenly bodies is in some ways a banal instantiation of ancient artistic notions of beauty. After all, as early as the fifth-century ВСЕ, the sculptuor Polyclitus had popularized the notion that the beauty of the body was based on symmetria and the harmony of the 2The exception being St. Agnes, who appears with a lamb. The characterization of Saints Perpetua and Felicitas in this way takes its rise from the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas in which Perpetua is described as well born ( honesta nata), liberally educated ( liberaliter instituía), and well married ( matronaliter nupta) and Felicitas is described as a slave ( Passio 2). Perpetuas transformation into masculine gladiator takes place in Passio 8. For a reappraisal of the social status of Perpetua, see Cooper (forthcoming). I am grateful to Kate Cooper for allowing me to read her paper in advance. On the way in which the martyrs are shaped and function in social reproduction and memory, see Castelli (2004). The elevation of paleness in Roman society is evidenced, for example, in the poetry of Catullus (Poem 13. 4). That only aristocratic women were confined indoors implicitly equates pallid beauty with socioeconomic privilege. On the importance of ability and beauty and the manner in which they coalesce in Greco-Roman art, see Davis (1995: 24). Davis argues that ancient societies (he appears to mean Greco-Roman societies) posited an ideal body type to which no human being could attain. This certainly seems to be the lingering interest in the creation and depiction of the resurrected body. While we can account for the uniformity of the saints' presentation through appeals to the pragmatic use of a single female model, this does not exhaust the significance of their uniformity. The Aristotelian preoccupation with uniformity, symmetry, and proportion traces the contours of the saints' images. See Aristotle's definition of beauty in Poetics , 7.34-8. Idealist aesthetics, such as this, are by no means limited to the classical age; see Auerbach (1953).

At the same time, however, the eradication of difference gestures toward an important and sinister theme in early Christian constructions of heaven- the nature of the perfected heavenly body. Heaven, like normality, is a constructed ideal. Literary descrip- tions, artistic depictions, and liturgical reenactments of heaven and heavenly affairs serve to construct and reproduce an ideal world. For marginalized communities, these constructions of heaven enable the authors to create alternate temples, priesthoods, and liturgies in which they can participate.7 As representations of divine affairs, these constructions can be used to reorganize the world and exert power over others. In the case of resurrected bodies, the character- ization of heavenly bodies as "perfected" communicates something about the relative values placed on gender, race, and disability and non-disability.8 The depictions of resurrected bodies in the early church do more than reinscribe culturally relative norms about the body; they offer a promise. They present a vision of a future in which the identities of existing bodies - actual people - will be recon- figured "perfectly"; an approaching future in which individual iden- tity will be overwritten and difference will be eradicated from the heavenly kingdom. This article examines the motif of bodily resurrection in some select early church authors and the way that resurrected bodies were charac- terized as perfect.9 In the past few decades the scholarly gaze has lighted and remained fixed upon the body. In early Christian studies, scholars have meticulously examined sexual conduct, sexual abstinence, clothing, feasting, bodily deprivation, pain, gender, and suffering of 6Polyclitus' canon is largely reconstructed from Pliny's Natural History 35.128; 35.79-80. For a discussion of the corpus, see Leftwich (1995). A list of these works can be found in Pliny's Natural History 35.128; 35.79-80. 7See, for example, the depiction of the temple and priesthood in the second-century ВСЕ text 1 Enoch and the discussion in Boccaccini (2001: 89-102). For an excellent discussion of the gendering of the resurrected body, see Jones (2007). inis article will use tne terms disabled and disability to rerer to any bodily condition judged by ancient Christians to be a "deficit" or "deficiency." It is important to note that there will be considerable slippage between modern and ancient categories of disability. I also assume, for the purposes of this article, that disability forms an integral part of a person's identity. This is in contrast to the work of UK Disability theorists like Colin Barnes, who have forcefully argued that disability stems only from society's prejudices (Barnes 1991). In this respect, I follow the work of Thomson (1997: 1-22). The parameters of this paper do not permit a thorough analysis of the formation of "disabled" identity.</page><page sequence="4">994 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ancient bodies.10 At the same time, outside of the study of religion, critical theorists have turned their attention to the way in which disability- like gender and race - is socially constructed. Moreover, like gender, race, and class, disability is a structuring device: it is, in the words of Jeremy Schipper, "integral to social organization itself' (Schipper 2006: 19). Examining the various uses and constructions of disability, as a means of organizing physical differences, is an important part of unveiling how society constructs normalcy. Disability theorists have posited a difference between impairment, a physiological condition that is essentially neutral, and disability, the way in which certain social and cultural forces act to render this impairment negatively and "disable" the person.11 For example, a person who uses a wheelchair may or may not be disabled depending on the situation. In the context of a marathon, a wheelchair user is not disabled; they will invariably outstrip their able-bodied competitors, but when faced with a flight of stairs or social biases the person becomes disabled. Furthermore, the classification and valuation of impairments change depending on the context. In classical Greek literature, for instance, blindness is frequently associated with prophetic and precognitive gifts. In Norman Britain, by contrast, the use of blinding as criminal punish- ment meant that blind people were often assumed to be criminals.12 The different valuations are not contingent upon giant temporal and geographical shifts; a scar, for instance, can be read by ancient Christian heroine Macrina as a tattoo, as divine writing on her 10See, for example, Brown (2008) and Perkins (1995). 11 Disability theory scholars have divided historical treatments of disability into three models: a religious model, a medical model, and a social or cultural model. The social model emphasizes the social constructedness of "disability" in contradistinction to "impairment." According to this view, the impairment that leads an individual to use a wheelchair only becomes a disability when this individual encounters discrimination in society that acts to disable them. See Barnes (1991). The cultural model blurs the boundaries between impairment and disability, positing that the social experience of disability includes a larger complex of social structures; see Davis (1995: 2, 11) and Thomson (1997: 1-22). With respect to the distinction between the "social model" and the "cultural model," a certain ideological cleft can be plotted between scholars in the United Kingdom and scholars in the United States. This in turn can be attributed to the varying underlying commitments of their work. In the UK, disability studies grew out of Marxist concerns for an oppressed underclass and over-emphasized society as the root of disability. For a discussion of the historical and political underpinnings of UK research, see Oliver (1990: 1-10). The cultural model as advocated by Davis, Mitchell, and Snyder dominates in North American scholarship and has become the theoretical underpinnings of American biblical scholarship on disability. See, for example, Raphael (2009: 1-18). For a succinct summary of the history of disability studies, see Schipper (2006: 15-22). 12For a discussion of blindness in the ancient world, see Rose (2003) and discussion below.

The recognition that disability is contextual and constructed requires that we attend to the ways in which religious texts construct dis/ ability. If we do not, then, as historians and scholars of religion, we miss something critically important about ancient views of embodiment. Following earlier discussions of the way in which resurrected bodies are gendered, this article focuses on the relationship between resurrected bodies and disability. How do disability and identity intersect in the afterlife? It argues that early Christians differed from their Jewish, Greek, and Roman predecessors in proposing that resurrected bodies were altered, "perfect," and "complete." What follows immediately is a brief examination of ideas about disability and postmortem identity prevalent among contemporary Jews, Greeks, and Romans.13 Discussions of the existence of gender and disability in resurrected bodies play a significant role in the writings of early church leaders. Yet, although significant work has been done on gender, none of the vast amount of scholarship on the differences between Christian, Jewish, and Greek views on the res- urrection identify dis/ability as a point of contestation or difference.14 This oversight is an example both of the way in which dis/ability has been neglected by historians of antiquity and the manner in which scholars have unconsciously reinscribed a view of the body that equates perfection with able-bodiedness. This paper does not pretend to provide a comprehensive account of ancient views of the afterlife, but rather to demonstrate the ways in which disability is preserved as a facet of postmortem identity in many of these accounts.1 From there we move to the development of the doctrine of the res- urrection of the body in the writings of Paul, Pseudo-Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Augustine. We will explore the way that perfect heavenly bodies were constructed in these texts and the systematic removal of disability from the Kingdom of God. This survey is not exhaustive; it is intended to reveal a change in the way perfection and identity are con- structed. Although early Christians were not alone in anticipating divine eschatological healing, the characterization of Goďs saving work The division of cultural influences into "Jewish," "Greek," and "Roman" is in no way intended to effect an artificial division between Jews and Greeks in antiquity. Even in Palestine, Hellenism and Judaism freely intermixed (see the work of Hengel, 1974). It is merely for the sake of convenience that such designations are used. 14The notable exception to this rule is Bynum (1995). 15For more exhaustive treatments of the afterlife in ancient Greek and Roman thought and their relationship to early Christian views on the afterlife, see Richardson (1985), Bolt (2002: 51-79), Porter (1999), and Lehtipuu (2007).</page><page sequence="6">996 Journal of the American Academy of Religion in history as a process of healing marks a profound shift in thought.16 Moreover, members of early churches characterized this process using the imagery and the language of healing. The discourse of healing in these texts is not neutral; it serves to exclude certain forms of embodi- ment as both abnormal and extraneous to human identity.17 This ideo- logical shift can be explained in historical terms as early Christian attempts to marry bodily resurrection with Platonic metaphysics and ancient aesthetics. The rhetorical function of this move is to narrate a history of salvation and eschatological vision in which disability is grad- ually written out of the Kingdom of God. The early Christians created an ideal post-apocalyptic world of bodily perfection, and the content of this perfection deserves our attention. GRECO-ROMAN VIEWS OF THE AFTERLIFE18 In many ways, Greco-Roman culture forms an unlikely backdrop for Christian ideas about the resurrection of the body. In the context of the Platonic philosophical tradition, which viewed the corrupt body as antithetical to the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the unwieldy, cumbersome body is an absurdity.19 The love affair between scholarship and Plato has led many to argue that there could be no connection between the earthly resurrection of Christianity and the pristine transcendence of Platonic dualism.20 Yet, if we look outside the academic niche of philosophy, it appears that there are numerous myth- ical stories and rituals in Greek tradition that suggest that bodies can be 16Both Isaiah 29 and the Dead Sea Scrolls (e.g., 1QS4.6-8) suggest that some anticipated an eschatological reversal marked by healing and feasting. See Murphy (2002: 261). The specific combination of eschatological healing and resurrection of the body does not appear to have been a notable feature of the Qumran community's vision. For a discussion of Isaiah 29, see Raphael (2009: 125). For a discussion of disabilitv in the scrolls, see Dormán (2007). 17The discourse of disease and healing does not have to be negative but it does wield power. The identification of certain conditions as in need of healing not only casts them as negative and those forms of embodiment as lacking, it also forces them to the margins of the human experience. We might compare the pathologization of homosexuality as mental disease as a strategy of condemnation. See Terry (1999). The division between Greco-Roman and Jewish ideas of the afterlife is by no means an attempt to reproduce long-debunked religionsgeschichtliche Schule dichotomies between Jews and Greeks. 19Plato, Crat. 400c; Phaedo. 81d-e, 82d-83d. For the view that the resurrection of the body was unheard of among the Greeks, see Bremmer (2002: 41), Wright (2003: 316), and Pearson (1973: 16-17). This perspective is rightly criticized by Endsjo (2008), who points to a number of instances in Greek myth and tradition in which bodies appear to have been resurrected. Add to this the evidence that Plato was not widely read in the ancient world (Cf., Plutarch, Moralia 328e; Origen, Contra Celsus 6.2) and the situation becomes decidedly more complicated.</page><page sequence="7">Moss: Eschatological Cleansing and the Resurrection of the Dead 997 reconstituted after death. In both the representation of the anthropo- morphized soul (the shade) in the underworld and the reconstitution of the dismembered in Greek culinary myths, a person's disability leaves its mark. Neither of these motifs is a direct antecedent to the idea of the resurrection of the body in Christianity, but both serve as examples of cultural contexts in which the disability is retained as a component of identity in discussions of postmortem existence. In the loose coalition of philosophies and mythologies that under- gird Greek and Roman thought, there was no single view on the rela- tionship of the body in life and postmortem existence. Yet, even to those writers for whom the resurrection of the sluggish body seemed improbable, the continued existence of the shade of a person - their soul - was well established. The continuation of the shade in the under- world preserved all the characteristics of the individual's body in life. All the various permutations of the physical appearance were repro- duced in phantasmic form. At the end of Sophocles' tragedy Oedipus Rex , the ill-fated king dis- covers that he killed his father and married his mother. His horror upon discovering that he was guilty of incest and patricide prompts him to blind himself so that he will no longer serve as a witness to the horror of his actions (1220-1223).21 At the same time, however, he offers an additional explanation for his behavior, stating that he does not wish to see his parents in the underworld: For if I still had eyesight, when I went Down to the underworld, how could I bear To see my father and my wretched mother?22 Oedipus' attempt to avoid confrontation with his parents - and thus the ramifications of his actions - reflects the belief that a person's manifes- tation in the underworld mirrors their physical existence in life. Oedipus assumes that he will be blind in the underworld just as he is now blind in life. His disability, gender, physical attributes, and memo- ries will remain intact, even if he no longer possesses a living body. The same notion undergirds the description of the underworld in both Homer's Odyssey and Virgil's reinterpretation of it in the Aeneid. In both accounts the protagonist takes a tour of the underworld where 21The interplay of light/darkness, vision/blindness, and knowledge/ignorance greatly dominate the imagery of the play. Blindness as a metaphor for ignorance is a commonplace in Greek literature that is frequently subverted by the paradox of the blind seer. See Rose (2003). Sophocles, Oedipus the Kingy 1305-07 (trans. Theodore Howard Banks).</page><page sequence="8">998 Journal of the American Academy of Religion he encounters the shades of the more famous dead.23 In book six of Virgil's account, Aeneas is guided by the Sibyl through the districts of the underworld. He encounters Eriphyle, a victim of unhappy love, "in tears as she displayed the wounds her cruel son had given her,"24 Dido "with her wound still fresh,"25 and Deiphobus, "mutilated" without ears or nose.26 The marking of a person's shade with wounds is not some- thing exclusive to those who suffered tragic and gruesome deaths. The heroes who play in the "home of the blest" proudly "bear the wounds received while fighting for their native land" as a reminder of their accomplishments. 7 The shade is an impressionable thing; it accurately reproduces the abilities of the body to which it was once connected. In addition to narratives about the anthropomorphic shade, there are mythic narratives about the dismemberment and reconstitution of deceased bodies. Pindar and Pseudo- Apollodorus recount the story of Pelops, who was cut up by his father and served as supper to the gods as part of an attempt to test the omniscience of the gods.28 The gods, perceiving the trick, place the parts of Pelops' body back in the caul- dron and retrieve him complete, only more beautiful, stronger, and younger than before. The reconstituted body of Pelops is improved by his ordeal but it is still the very same body. Unfortunately for Pelops, the ravenous goddess Demeter consumed his shoulder before the ingre- dients of the dish were revealed. The assembled gods were unable to recreate - ex nihilo - Pelops' shoulder and an ivory prosthesis was sup- plied in its place.29 The tension between divine improvement and intrinsic corporeal identity bubbles beneath the surface; Pelops is improved and yet still disabled. In these few examples we can identify at least two strains of thought in which disability is preserved in the afterlife of the individual; the immortality of the soul (the shade) and the reassembly of individuals by gods. Doubtless, we could detect greater variation were we to look further. These perspectives may not have sat comfortably together nor are they direct parallels to bodily resurrection, but they hold in 23There has been some debate about whether the Homeric version of this story (Od. 11.51-83) is original. As a resource for ancient thought on the resurrection of the dead, it hardly seems to matter. See Faesi (1884: 155). Virgil, The Aeneidy 6.445-6.446 (trans. David West). Ibid., 6.451.

The infirmity persists in their afterlife, either in their body or in their shade. That the shade is not a physical body only makes its preservation of infirmity all the more interesting. Disability is not just a superficial scratch, it is a component of who a person is. According to these strains of thought, there is "an absolute bodily continuity" between the body as it is now and the individual as he or she will exist after death.30 Eternal life preserved the contours of the individual's physical identity. JEWISH VIEWS OF THE AFTERLIFE According to the classical scholarly view, Jewish ideas about the afterlife were the primary inspiration for the Christian belief that the bodies of the dead would be resurrected.31 In the Hebrew Bible, ideas about bodily resurrection can be traced to the so-called Isaian Apocalypse (Isa. 24-27) in which the prophet exclaims that the "dead shall live, their corpses shall rise" (Isa. 26:19).32 A vivid representation of resurrection is found in the famous vision of the valley of dry bones in Ezekiel 37, in which the prophet sees a valley of bones brought to life by God. The bones themselves are re-covered with sinews and reconstituted into human beings. The following verses clarify that this passage is about the effect of prophecy on the exiles, but the symbolic vision of resurrection left a deep imprint on both Jewish and Christian visions of the afterlife.33 The evocative frescoes of the synagogue of Dura-Europos portray Ezekiel's valley of revivified bones as a glorious resurrection of the dead and the early Christian church fathers used Ezekiel as a proof text for their own views on the afterlife.34 Belief in the resurrection of the body gained strength in the Hellenistic period during the Maccabean revolt in the second-century Endsjo (2008: 434). Drawing upon pejorative stereotypes of Jews, traditional scholarship has offset Jewish "materialism" against Greek "spirituality," yet there was as much diversity of thought among ancient Jews as ancient Greeks. On the materialism of Judaism see Dahl (1962: 11 ni). The polarization of Jew/Greek, material/immaterial, body/soul is part of a latent anti-Judaism in biblical studies which regards Judaism as the baser and less intellectual cultural influence. On the immortality of the soul in ancient Judaism, see Nicklesburg (1972), who points to the resurrection of spirits in Jubilees 23:31 and 1 Enoch 103:4. Cf. Wis. 2:23-3.4; 4 Масс. 7:19; Philo, Opif. 135; Josephus, B.J. 2.8.11; and Mt. 16:13-14. On the diversity of opinions in ancient Judaism, see Nicklesburg (1972: 180) and Cavallini (1974: 180). For a discussion of healing and disability in visions of the future in Isaiah, see Schipper (forthcoming). See Levenson (2006: 156-165). Justin Martyr, Apol. 2.87; Irenaeus Haer. 5.1; Tertullian, Res. 30 cited in Segal (2004: 257).

In the accounts of their struggles, a number of the Maccabean martyrs express the hope that in disdaining their life now, they will receive it back in the afterlife. One of the seven martyred sons offers his hands and tongue to be cut off, saying, "I got these from heaven, and because of his laws I disdain them, and from him I hope to get them back again" (2 Масс. 7:10-11). He is confident, as is his mother, that his hands will be restored again by the creator God, presumably at the resur- rection (cf., 2 Масс. 7:23). The confident martyr Razis embodies this in his death, throwing himself upon his sword and angrily hurling his own entrails at the crowd, "calling on the Lord of life and spirit to give them back to him again" (2 Масс. 14:41-46). It is unclear whether Razis believes he will receive back his entrails or "life" in general, but his state- ment presupposes that God would be able to create a new life for him, even if the individual parts of his body are destroyed. In many ways, Razi's statement is the narrative culmination of Maccabean resistance. His vision of his impending resurrection subverts the spirit-body hier- archy of his Hellenistic oppressors and claims final victory in the world to come. These writings not only demonstrate a firm belief in the resurrection of the body, but also an emerging tradition that God would be able to recreate the body anew. Although this new creation would seem to imply that the individual's body would be improved upon, there is no explicit discussion of healing or disability. The focus of these accounts is the omnipotence and eventual triumph of God. The connection between creation of the human body and eschatological "restoration" underlies the account, but it is hardly the point of the work. The discus- sion of bodily recreation serves as a means of resisting oppression rather than defining perfection. THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY IN THE JESUS MOVEMENT With the advent of Christianity, new perspectives on the nature of the afterlife began to emerge. Although some educated, elitist Christians- most notably the gnostics- adopted a Hellenistic Jewish understanding of the immortality of the soul after death, the majority of Christians pro- fessed that the body itself would be resurrected in the afterlife. Resurrection of the body can be traced, if one is so inclined, to Christianity's origins as an apocalyptic sect confronted with the uncom- fortable reality that its founder, Jesus, had been killed. In the aftermath of Jesus' trial and death, his followers developed the idea that his body was resurrected as a means of explanation and vindication. Additionally,</page><page sequence="11">Moss : Eschatological Cleansing and the Resurrection of the Dead 1001 as we saw with the Maccabees, the anticipation of resurrection served as a means of boundary marking and resistance.35 Among scholars, there has been considerable discussion about the origins of Christian beliefs in the resurrection of the body and its func- tion in early Christianity. These debates, however, have been uninter- ested in the identity of the resurrected body.36 Upon closer examination it will become apparent that although Christians were happy for the resurrected Jesus to remain scarred and disabled, they saw the general resurrection of the dead at the end of the world as the process by which disability would be removed from the world.37 Of the four canonical gospels, only the Gospels of Luke and John go into detail about the nature of Jesus' resurrected body. In the road to Emmaus pericope in Luke 24, the two men do not recognize the risen Jesus until he breaks bread with them; previously their eyes had prevented them from seeing him (24:16, 31). It is their bodily impairment, rather than any change to the form of Jesus, that pre- vents them from recognizing him. When Jesus suddenly appears to the disciples in the upper room they are "startled and terrified" and believe that they have seen a ghost (24:37). Jesus reassures his disci- ples, saying, "Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have" (24:38-39). Jesus' corporeality is in question both for the audience and their narrative representatives, the disciples. Both groups are reassured by Luke: Jesus eats (24:42-43) and has flesh and bones. Presumably the narrative focus on Jesus' hands and feet is an invitation to gaze at the wounds inflicted upon him during the crucifixion. These wounds are not only a marker of Jesus' identity, they are the primary marker of his identity, the manner in which he is recognized, and the proof that he really is Jesus. The importance of Jesus' bodily wounds as a marker of his identity is only amplified in John. According to Chapter 20, the resurrected body of Jesus preserved the wounds he acquired during the 35So Setzer (2004: 47-50), who argues that for both Judaism and Christianity bodily resurrection was a form of resistance. In the case of Christianity, it is not immediately clear why appeals to the immortality and judgment of the soul could not have served the same purpose. For discussions of the resurrection of the body in Christianity, see Segal (2004: 399-486), Setzer (2004: 76-139), Porter et al. (1999), and Perkins (1984). If the impulse of the reader is to remark that there is no need to view Jesus' wounds as a negative in the afterlife we must then also enquire - why must Christian bodies be healed?</page><page sequence="12">1002 Journal of the American Academy of Religion crucifixion.38 After his death, Jesus invites doubting Thomas to probe the reality of the wounds he received on the cross: A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you." Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe." Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!" (John 20:26-28) Jesus' insistence and Thomas' response indicate that the resurrected body of Jesus is continuous with his living body. Even in his glorious resurrected body he remains scarred and bleeding. Moreover, Jesus' wounds are an integral part of his identity. It is by his wounds that he is recognized as Jesus himself. It is only his infirmities that permit Thomas to identify him as his Lord and God. Once again, in the case of Jesus, the brokenness of his body forms a critical part of his identity. We might argue that, for this author, it is the holes in his hand and side that mark him as God.39 In the reception of this narrative in the early church, the marks on Jesus' resurrected body - especially the wound in his side - come, in some readings, to function positively as a link between heaven and earth. In the second-century martyrdom of the Letter of the Churches of Lyons and Vienne , the martyr Sanctus is tortured with burning plates of bronze. As he burned, he was strengthened by the anesthetizing power of the "heavenly fountain of the water of life that flows from the side of Christ."40 Jesus' fortifying hemorrhage collapses the boundaries between heaven and earth, sustaining the church even from the heavens.41 The nature of Jesus' resurrected body and its positive function in the life of the church is, as we will see, sharply distinguished from the bodies of the general resurrection of the dead. If the resurrected body of Jesus is contiguous with his living body, the bodies of ordinary Christians will 38It is worth noting that, in a modern context, a non-healing wound is a chronic medical condition associated with aging, arterial disease, and diabetes. In a medical context, they are unequivocally constructed as a disability. The function that the non-healing wounds play both in the Gospel of John and early church interpretations of this incident indicates that we should view Jesus' impairment positively. For a disability studies reading of the resurrected body of Jesus, see Eiesland (1994: 100-101) and Willis (2002: 215-229). 40 Letter of the Churches of Lyons and Vienne , 1.22.

Despite the fact that the resurrection of Jesus is the prototype for the general resurrection of the dead, Jesus' own pierced body is not prototypical for the form of resurrected bodies. The locus classicus for Christian belief in the resurrection of the body is Paul's first letter to the Corinthians. In Chapter 15, Paul, the self-appointed apostle to the Gentiles, announces a general resurrection of the Christian dead at the end of time. His pronouncement goes on to explore - for the benefit of his Hellenized Corinthian audience - the nature of this resurrected body and its relationship to the decaying bodies of the temporal world: But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?" Fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And as for what you sow, you do not sow the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. . . . What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body. . . . Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven. What I am saying, brothers and sisters, is this: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the per- ishable inherit the imperishable. Listen, I will tell you a mystery! We will not all die, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twin- kling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For this perishable body must put on imperishability, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When this perishable body puts on imper- ishability, and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled ". . . Where, О death, is your sting?" (1 Cor. 15:35-55) Despite his extended discussion, Paul never clarifies what elements are used to make up these glorious bodies. There is an ambiguous relation- ship between bodies as they are now (the seed) and bodies as they will be in the resurrection (sprouted). They are both continuous and discon- tinuous.42 Paul presents his readers with a challenge- how are resur- rected bodies both continuous and discontinuous? What is changed? What remains the same? Paul's imagery is unclear and ambiguous. 42The surprising continuity of the resurrected body is emphasized in Bynum (1995: 6-11).</page><page sequence="14">1004 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Exactly how resurrection transforms the body rests on the interpreter's sense both of what is essential to preserve identity and what aspects of the person are undesirable. POST- APOSTOLIC PERIOD After the deaths of the apostles, constructions of the resurrected body continued in the early church to take shape within the context of intellectual challenges from Greek philosophy. For some, like Ignatius of Antioch, belief in the resurrection of the dead became a kind of litmus test for orthodoxy and conformity in the church. Yet for all Ignatius' optimism, resurrection of the body was by no means universal even for those who would later be termed the proto-orthodox. Others, termed "apologists" for the conciliatory approach they took toward Rome, were additionally concerned with defending Christian beliefs about the resur- rection.43 For these authors, it was necessary to explain Christian doc- trine using the language of Greek and Roman philosophy, as it was only by rendering Christianity philosophically intelligible that they could win over internal skeptics or external critics. The resurrection of the dead proved to be one of the sticking points for critics of Christianity. To a Platonist, the resurrection of cumbersome physical bodies was unintelli- gible. Why would one want a body if one could escape it? A pseudepigraphical treatise, De Resurrectione (On the Resurrection ), attributed to the second-century Christian philosopher Justin Martyr, engaged skeptical philosophical opponents of bodily resurrection head- on.44 Drawing upon Pauline notions of continuity and discontinuity, Pseudo-Justin argues that the body will be resurrected, only perfectly. An emblematic example for Pseudo-Justin is the role of infirmity in the resurrection. Against those who would suppose that disabled bodies rise disabled, Pseudo-Justin contends: Well, they say, if then the flesh rise, it must rise the same as it falls; so that if it die with one eye, it must rise one-eyed; if lame, lame; if defec- tive in any part of the body, in this part the man must rise deficient. How truly blinded are they in the eyes of their hearts! For they have not seen on the earth blind men seeing again, and the lame walking by 43Setzer's division between "bridge building" apologists and "boundary defining" writers like Ignatius appears to overstate the aims of apologetics. It is possible that apologetic writers like Tertullian aim both to explain resurrection using Greco-Roman rhetoric and also to define Christianity using resurrection as a gauge. For a discussion of the rhetorical program of the apologists and their function as boundary makers, see Edwards et al. (1999). See Archambault (1905).</page><page sequence="15">Moss: Eschatological Cleansing and the Resurrection of the Dead 1005 His word. All things which the Saviour did, He did in the first place in order that what was spoken concerning Him in the prophets might be fulfilled, "that the blind should receive sight, and the deaf hear," and so on; but also to induce the belief that in the resurrection the flesh shall rise entire. For if on earth He healed the sicknesses of the flesh, and made the body whole, much more will He do this in the resurrec- tion, so that the flesh shall rise perfect and entire. In this manner, then, shall those dreaded difficulties of theirs be healed.45 Pseudo-Justin's theoretical opponents appear to reproduce the tradi- tional Greco-Roman idea that the characteristics of a person's body are important for his or her identity even after the body itself has died. The characterization of these elements as "defective" is typical both of the ancient perspective that disability is deficiency and also of the idea that these conditions form an integral and enduring part of a person's iden- tity. We should not assume, however, that these perceived opponents view the resurrection of disabled bodies positively. On the contrary, the invocation of this idea appears to be a rhetorical ploy to elicit disgust. Pseudo-Justin's opponents do not believe in physical resurrection. The argument that disabled bodies will rise as disabled was rhetorically powerful precisely because it utilized ancient distaste for perceived deformities. Infirmity stands as a cipher for corrupt and weak flesh. Introducing disability into heaven - the realm of divine perfection - would be an affront to ancient sensibilities that placed disability at odds with divinity. Against this view, Pseudo-Justin argues that such a con- flict is largely irrelevant. Resurrected bodies, he writes, will be "whole" and "perfect." Disability is not a part of someone's identity, it is part of the extraneous corrupt matter that is discarded in the resurrection. Eschatological cleansing will transform the body so that it is no longer decaying and useless. Pseudo-Justin counters his philosophical opponents with biblical proof texts and salvation history. The process of eschatological healing begun in stories of Jesus' healings in Palestine will be completed in the eschatological transformation of the world. Pseudo-Justin constructs a view of God's actions in history as a history of healing - a history of God acting to remove the deficient disability that mars God's otherwise perfect creation. The accounts of healing in the gospel narratives were but an overture to the main eschatological performance. Interestingly, however, barrenness, the prototypical disability in the Hebrew Bible, is not revoked in the resurrection of the body. On the 45Pseudo- Justin Martyr, On the Resurrection , 4 ( ANF 1: 344).</page><page sequence="16">1006 Journal of the American Academy of Religion contrary, Pseudo-Justin treats earthly infertility as anticipating the state of the resurrected body: The function of the womb is to become pregnant; and of the member of the male to impregnate. But as, though these members are destined to discharge such functions, it is not therefore necessary that they from the beginning discharge them (since we see many women who do not become pregnant, as those that are barren, even though they have wombs), so pregnancy is not the immediate and necessary conse- quence of having a womb; but those even who are not barren abstain from sexual intercourse, some being virgins from the first, and others from a certain time. And we see men also keeping themselves virgins, some from the first, and some from a certain time; so that by their means, marriage, made lawless through lust, is destroyed.46 In this passage, barrenness is reshaped as a heavenly precursor and is reformed as eschatological help. The barren female body is reshaped by Pseudo-Justin as angelic. Pseudo-Justin's motivation here is to discredit the suggestion that there is procreation in heaven. He appears to engage the Aristotelian assumption that body parts must be ordered toward their proper function. Some atypical bodily states are constructed as heavenly. This rhetoric of restoration and healing is typical of Christianity's attitude to disability in general. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons in the latter part of the second century, uses medical imagery throughout his defense of resurrection in his Adversus Haeresus ( Against the Heresies ). In his treatment of the afterlife, Irenaeus anticipates that the second coming of Christ will bring with it widespread judgment followed by an eschatological cleansing: At his coming "the lame man shall leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall [speak] plainly, and the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear," and that "the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, shall be strengthened," and that "the dead which are in the grave shall arise," and that he Himself "shall take [upon him] our weaknesses, and bear our sorrows,"- [all these] proclaimed those works of healing which were accomplished by him.47 Images of healing and resurrection parallel one another here - the "lame" walking and the dead rising are apparently synonymous acts. 46Pseudo- Justin, On the Resurrection , 3 ( ANF 1.344). Irenaeus, Adversus Haeresus , 4.33.11 ( ANF 2.14).</page><page sequence="17">Moss: Eschatological Cleansing and the Resurrection of the Dead 1007 Death and deafness are essentially similar. Once again, the resurrection of the dead will be characterized by healing and strengthening. Like Pseudo-Justin, Irenaeus justifies his belief in bodily resurrection in the healing actions of Jesus: in what bodies did they [people Jesus healed during his earthly minis- try] rise again? In those same, no doubt, in which they had also died. For if it were not in the very same, then certainly those same individu- als who had died did not rise again. For [the Scripture] says, "The Lord took the hand of the dead man, and said to him, Young man, I say to you, Arise. And the dead man sat up, and He commanded that something should be given him to eat; and He delivered him to his mother." . . . As, therefore, those who were healed [by Jesus] were made whole in those members [parts of the body] which had in times past been afflicted; and the dead rose in the identical bodies, their limbs and bodies receiving health, and that life which was granted by the Lord, who prefigures eternal things by temporal, and shows that it is He who is Himself able to extend both healing and life to His handi- work, that His words concerning its [future] resurrection may also be believed.48 Irenaeus' argument is certainly more convoluted than Pseudo-Justin's, yet it appeals to the same rhetorical trope: a catena of scriptural quota- tions pertaining to Jesus' healings prefigures the resurrection. Jesus healed and raised people from the dead in order to demonstrate that at the end of time God will heal and raise people from the dead in their bodies. In offering a biblically based justification for the resurrection, Irenaeus reinforces the New Testament connection between healing and salvation, able-bodiedness and divine order. One of the innovations that the New Testament makes to ancient constructions of disability is to overlay the association of disability and sin/impurity/punishment with the understanding that healing and salvation are synonymous. Jesus is the physician who comes to "heal" the sinners (Mark 2:17). It is to this notion of salvation as healing and healing as salvation that Irenaeus refers. The continued presence of disability in the world is an indication that salvation is incomplete. At the same time, Irenaeus raises an important question about iden- tity that exposes the chasm between ancient Christian and modern con- structions of disability. Irenaeus is concerned about the preservation of 48Irenaeus, Adversus Haeresus, 5.13.1 ( ANF 1.539).</page><page sequence="18">1 008 Journal of the American Academy of Religion the identity and it is precisely for this reason that he dwells on the fate of the body. Irenaeus stands at the beginning of a highly materialistic western tradition, which locates personal identity in the body's materi- ality.49 It must be resurrected because, without it, the person him- or herself is not truly resurrected. Disability, however, is not a part of that identity; it is God's "handiwork impaired by wickedness" (5.12.6), and cannot find its way into the afterlife. Not only, then, is disability ren- dered unimportant to the construction of one's identity, it becomes- as a corruption - a hindrance to finding God. Human identity, as a repro- duction of the divine image, is only fully present in the non-disabled. The reference to Goďs "handiwork" alludes, as do the protests of the Maccabees, to the all-powerful creator God who modeled humanity on himself. In anticipating the completion of salvation at the eschaton, Irenaeus looks back to its beginning; to the creation of the world by God and the "wickedness" that impaired, quite literally, Goďs perfect creation. Disability is tied to the primordial sin and must be removed from the world for salvation to be complete.50 For Irenaeus, disability is the sinful residue that tarnishes Goďs highly polished creation. Pseudo-Justin and Irenaeus present radically materialistic visions of heaven, a materialism inherited and transmitted by Augustine. Whatever his views earlier in his life, by the time of the composition of the City of God , Augustine has moved to an intensely materialistic and physical understanding of the resurrection; in the words of David Dawson, a process of becoming "more embodied."51 In his interpreta- tion of the Pauline dictum that "flesh and blood will not possess the kingdom of God" (1 Cor. 15:50), Augustine insists that the corruptibil- ity of the flesh would not survive but that the substance of the flesh would be resurrected (Retr. 2.3). So, too, Augustine maintains in his reading of the passion narrative that Christ appeared "in the same members" (Retr. 1.17). He is insistent that anything "naturally present" in human bodies will be present at the resurrection but that this will not include "deformity" or "infirmity."52 In the resurrection, the body 49See Anderson (1998: 177). 50The association between disability and sin is assumed in the "religious model of disability" touted by disability studies scholars as the pre-modern view of disability, see Thomson (1997: 1-22). What we should note, however, is that Irenaeus ties disability to a specific sin - the primordial sin- and to humanity's sinfulness in general. 51Dawson (1994: 5). See also Burrus (2009: 250-256) and Hunter (forthcoming). Augustine, City of God 22.20.1152. Augustine writes that there will be two sexes at the eschaton because a woman's sex is not a defect. God created two sexes so God will restore them both (22.17.1145).</page><page sequence="19">Moss : Eschatological Cleansing and the Resurrection of the Dead 1009 will be perfectly subject to the soul; mortality, sickness, and pain will be replaced by incorruptibility.53 Following Pseudo-Justin and Tertullian, Augustine posits that the resurrected body preserves the functions of the living body, even if it has no use of them. The blessed dine at heavenly banquets, even if they have no use for food. Yet, the beatification of the body and the redemption of the flesh mean the erasure of deformity. Deformity, in this case, signifies not only bodily infirmity but the absence of proportionality. Augustine is deeply concerned with the aesthetic problems that a lack of proportion might present. Having established that all parts of the body will be resur- rected in order to save humans from deformity, he then dwells on the problems that the gathering together of discarded hair and nail clippings will present for the beauty of this body ( City of God, 22.19). The resur- rection of such things would cause an ugly, monstrous deformity.54 He argues, therefore, that much like an artist can work broken sections of a vase into the clay, these discarded pieces of the body would be absorbed into the whole resurrected body rather than returned to their original location. This concern for proportion and beauty appears elsewhere in this section. Augustine suggests that those who are too fat or too thin will have what is in superabundance or lacking removed from or sup- plied to them and crooked parts will be straightened. In Augustine's nar- rative, the Creator serves as cosmetic surgeon; augmenting, extracting, and appending in order to produce aesthetically pleasing, harmonious bodies: "for all bodily beauty is the harmony of parts" ( omnis enim cor- poris pulchritude est partium congruentia).55 Proportion and perfection are further modified with respect to the form of the ideal male; in the resurrection, all bodies will be reconsti- tuted to the size that they had enjoyed in the prime of life ( City of God , 22.15), and even infants will be resurrected as grown men ( City of Gody 22.13-14). Aesthetics remain central: Augustine will not permit the beard or nipples of a man to be removed because this would introduce ugliness, "Take away the nipples from the manly breast, and see how much beauty you have spoiled, how much ugliness you have intro- duced" (Ser. 243.6). Despite his focus on beauty over utility, Augustine betrays a lingering commitment to ability in his discussion of the func- tion of the eyes. While acknowledging that vision was not strictly 53 City of God 22.21 and Ser. 242A.3. Semel quipped intellecto ita nihil periturum esse de corpore ut deforme nihil sit in corpore, simul intellegitur ea quae deformem factura fuerant enormitatem massae ipsi accessura esse , non locis in quibus membrorum forma turpetur ( City of God, 22.19). "Augustine, City of God, 22.19.</page><page sequence="20">1010 Journal of the American Academy of Religion necessary for the knowledge of God, Augustine is unwilling to give up the possibility that physical eyes are functionally important (City of Gody 22.29). The physical eyes will see more intently and in a "divine manner" (Ser. 243.5). The utility of the eyes is unnecessary for aes- thetics or apprehension of the divine, yet Augustine preserves this ability all the same. In the case of scarred martyrs, whose wounds were received as part of a divinely sanctified mission, the situation is slightly different.56 The bodies of the martyrs will, like those of other Christians, be reas- sembled, yet the marks of these wounds will be preserved in their immortal flesh. Just as Pseudo-Justin reconfigured barrenness, Augustine repackages scars as marks. Their "blemishes" will not be visible in the world to come because they are no longer blemishes- they should no longer even be spoken of as defects.57 Augustine appears torn between his "desire to see in the kingdom of heaven the marks of the wounds which they received for Christ's name" and his belief that wounds (imperfections) do not exist in Goďs world.58 These wounds will not count as deformity but as an honor (non enim defor- mitas in eis sed dignitas erit ), and the bodies of the martyrs will shine with a certain beauty, not of the body but of virtue (quaedam quanvis in corpore non corporis sed virtutis pulchritude fulgebit). That Augustine identifies this beauty as qualitatively different from that of other resur- rected bodies perhaps indicates an inability to treat scarred bodies as physically beautiful. Even as he concedes the presence of marks, Augustine reiterates once again that, although marked, the bodies of the martyrs remain proportionate and intact. All the members of the martyr's body are restored even as their wounds are re-presented. In this way, Augustine is able to remain consistent, in the heavenly city the body will have "no deformity, no infirmity, no heaviness, no cor- ruption - nothing of any kind unfit for that kingdom."59 The perfection of the disabled body at the eschaton in the writings of the early church can be understood as an extension of Christian I am grateful to Kristi Upson-Saia for allowing me to read her paper, Resurrecting Deformities: Augustine on Scars and Marks on Heavenly Bodies," presented in the Rhetoric of Heaven Session of the annual meeting of the North American Patristics Society, May 28, 2010.

I sympathize with the sentiment but disagree with Jones reading of this passage, in which she suggests that Augustine thinks blemishes will be beautiful in the body of Christ (2007: 29). Her suggestion that blemish is redefined as glorious is wonderful but, to me at least, seems to misrepresent Augustine's view. I take her point, however, that it is in his description of the martyrs that Augustine comes closest to allowing disability into his divine city.

All of these writers utilize tradi- tions in which disability is associated with sin, and healing is equated with divine forgiveness or salvation.60 At the same time, these depic- tions of resurrected bodies are indebted to ancient aesthetics and phi- losophy. At certain critical junctures, the categories of impairment are themselves redrawn to accommodate a pressing theological or philo- sophical concern. Thus, even if the effect of these statements is to bar the gates of heaven to the disabled by insisting on eschatological trans- formation, disability is constructed differently in these accounts.61 CONCLUSION Attending to impairment and disability in the discussion of bodies (resurrected or otherwise) revises our understanding of what counts as an identity marker in the ancient world. The focus on the resurrection of the body as a test for orthodoxy only invited further speculation on the nature, form, and fingernails of these bodies. Although scholars have long noted the debate over the preservation of gender in the resur- rection, the rhetorical force of the discourse of eschatological healing has gone largely overlooked. Yet the eradication of deformity (as defined by ancient authors) is a notable feature of the emerging doc- trine on the resurrection. In the reassembly of the physical body, stark differences emerge between the eschatological bodies of Christianity and the afterlife of Greco-Roman myth and Jewish apocalyptic. Even the pierced, resurrected body of Jesus, the paradigm and prototype for general resurrection- so suggestive, so potent- lies broken on the wayside. Unlike Jesus, the resurrected bodies of the general dead are unmarked. The divine disability of Christ was discarded for a different kind of imago del Most forms of impairment are not reproduced at the resurrection; they are discarded as part of the dark, chaotic, disordered corpora of corruption. As materialistic identity began to take hold of Western Christianity's notion of the self, impairment became "In Jewish contexts, sin and disability were frequently linked; both the Old Testament and literature from Qumran presuppose that illness is divine punishment for sinfulness. See Deuteronomy 28:21-22, Job 15:20-21, Psalm 32, and the Prayer of Nabonidus 4QPrNab (4Q242) frags. 1-3. Recent studies by biblical scholars have explored the association between disability, sin, punishment, class, and impurity in ancient Judaism at length. See Schipper (2006), Avalos (1995), Avalos et al. (2007), Olyan (2008), and Raphael (2009). For a discussion of disease and sickness in the New Testament, see Borgen (1981) and Avalos (1999). The Dead Sea Scrolls (e.g., 1QS4.6-8) suggest that the marginalized community at Qumran anticipated an eschatological reversal marked by healing and feasting. See Murphy (2002: 261). The specific combination of eschatological healing, salvation, restoration, and the resurrection of the body does not appear to have been a notable feature of the Qumran community's vision.</page><page sequence="22">1012 Journal of the American Academy of Religion non-essential. Christianity scoured its resurrected bodies and narrated its history so that the salvation of all flesh is completed with the blot- ting out of impairment. Just as the focus on gender and race has informed the study of reli- gion more broadly, recognizing and tracing the contours of disability in religious discourse has significant value for our understanding of embodiment. Early Christian insistence on both bodily continuity and eschatological healing reveals the importance of notions of uniformity and proportion in ancient Christian constructions of the afterlife. At the same time, this discussion does more than just shape resurrected bodies; it evaluates certain bodily characteristics as more or less integral components of human identity.
