<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Kerner The Problem of Evil in the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" The last two lines of the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn"- the urn's speech1- lead us to see that the ode is an attempt at theodicy, like Keats's great journal-letter passage explaining human life as a "vale of Soul-making" (2:102).2 The commentary following the sibylline aphorism " 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' " tells us twice that what the urn, by implication, is dismissing as unnecessary -in saying that that is "all ye need to know"- is not, primarily, Keats's barrage of historical questions, but an unspoken question. First, his introduction to her speech- "When old age shall this generation waste, / Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe / Than ours, a friend to man"- promises this friendship to future generations as long as the urn survives, and this means the urn is speaking to us. What she is dismissing, therefore, has to be some- thing Keats thinks we want to know- something, moreover, we believe we "need to know" if we are to live fulfilled lives, for such importance is implicit in the value the urn claims for the aphorism she offers as a substitute. And Keats cannot have thought we would find that importance in literal answers to his ten questions, for these are all clearly rhetorical; the ode, once understood, iden- tifies the essential meaning of the scenes Keats asks about, which have come from his own imagination. (We have heard those ques- tions, of course: while Keats expects us to accept the fiction that he is addressing an actual urn, which will be speaking to us in- dependently, he knows that his statement of the urn's message is reaching us through his poem.) Second, the oracular sweep of the first half of the urn's commentary ("that is all / Ye know on earth") makes this pronouncement a claim of an absolute difference be- tween what is knowable in this life and what we may hope to learn after death; and Keats believes we must grant the authority of the claim: we may not suppose he can be inviting the rejoinder, "Oh, yes, what you want from the urn was not known On earth' then, but now it is: your ode is out of date." Now, such a rejoinder</page><page sequence="2">David Kerner . 228 Keats might well have considered possible if the urn's pronounce- ment meant merely, "On earth' no more can ever be learned about ancient Greece"; for, given his interest in Edward Davies's Celtic Researches, we may not assume Keats believed that ar- chaeology, philology, and other, yet unknown, kinds of digging into the past could never (in the case of an actual urn) turn up literal answers to such historical questions as he has asked. And even if we do assume Keats thought such answers irrecoverable, they would still be earthly (they were once known by man), so we could not find there what no man can "know on earth/' The sup- plication of the sacrificial rite in the fourth stanza shows that the ode does not exempt the ancient world from the limits of human knowledge. As Keats has told us elsewhere, the "golden histories" the nightingale sings in the Elysium of "Bards of passion and of mirth" are "Of heaven and its mysteries"3 (i.e., the knowledge available only in heaven will not consist of courses in ancient Greek history); and revelation "on earth" of these mysteries is one of the "pious frauds of Religion" (2:80). ("You know my ideas about Religion," Keats wrote Bailey early in 1818; "nothing in this world is proveable," 1:242.) To put this another way, "all / Ye know on earth" can only be a claim that human beings, while alive, can learn no more than the oracular urn has revealed of what they think they need to know; and the urn can hardly be- lieve that the historical information, devoid as it must be of ulti- mate revelation, would tell us more. We are forced to conclude that "that is all / Ye know on earth" parries an appeal for some- thing the urn does recognize as more than the available aphorism offers. Alerted by this conclusion, we hear the ode's unspoken appeal. "Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave / Thy song" asks the urn why, since Keats has been given genius, his life (as he fears, especially after watching Tom die) must be cut short- so painfully cut short- before that genius can be fulfilled. Keats could say, near the end (as Severn reports), "I think a malignant being must have power over us- over whom the Almighty has little or no influence" (KC, 1:181). But death by old age too, the ode asserts, is a "waste"; this is why Keats had said of Bailey- whose "sort of probity &amp; disinterestedness . . . does hold &amp; grasp the tip top of any spiritual honours, that can be paid to any thing in this world"-"he shall not die by God" (1:205, 160). Nor is death the only "woe" that afflicts each generation: Keats's hope- less longing, as in "Bright star," for the unchanging perfection that wins the lovers on the urn three "happy "s, over the melodist's one and the boughs' two (it is this hopelessness that the lingering</page><page sequence="3">Evil in the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" . 229 repetitions in stanzas 2 and 3 express), is a bitter admission that what he had placed "at the tip-top" of human happiness, where "Life's self is nourished by its proper pith" (Ε, Ι.805-07, 814), he now knows, "leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd." In re- sponse, the worshipers on the urn testify (anxiously) "there is still a heaven with its Stars above [man's] head" (2:101)4 And in counterresponse, Keats climaxes his unspoken question with the ode's one simile, just before he introduces the urn's reply- "Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought / As doth eternity." Keats, without faith in religion or "consequitive reasoning" (1:285), understands "eternity" as a denial of antecedent metaphysical purpose and ultimate fulfillment; it is an unsponsored endlessness reinforcing the mystery of the contradictory world that lines 15- 30 question. Delicately, between the lines, Keats has brought the urn "the Burden of the Mystery" (1:277). Precisely what that burden is and its presence in the ode are amplified by the way Keats leads up to his "Soul-making" theodi- cy on 21 April 1819. When he says, "The most interesting ques- tion that can come before us is, How far by the persevering en- deavours of a seldom appearing Socrates Mankind may be made happy- I can imagine such happiness carried to an extreme," Keats immediately adds, "But in truth I do not at all believe in this sort of perfectibility- the nature of the world will not admit of it" (2:101). So the true question is why "a" Socrates can make so little headway, which is a mystery for all who are moved to believe, as they were taught, that God is both benevolent and omnipotent. Here, in the problem of evil, is the ode's unspoken question, which the urn recognizes as "the most interesting ques- tion that can come before us" because it is the question of the meaning of life- the one thing we think we "need to know" if we are to know what to do with our lives. Yet we can never have the answer, since "silence and slow time" make foster children of us all. To the question, Why must Keats die young, why must there be the "eternal fierce destruction" that makes him say, after he "saw / Too far into the sea," "Still am I sick of it" (the verse- letter to Reynolds, 11. 93-99), the urn can only answer, as a naiad answers Endymion, "Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above" (II. 128). s Job asks the same question; and in each case, the pur- ported revelation is what the author has learned for himself with- out supernatural help (which best explains the ode's troublesome quotation marks). What each has learned is the consolation that the world, which man could not make, is magnificent even with its horrors: "When we look at the Heavens we cannot be proud" (1:179). "Beauty is truth" says to Keats that though "but to</page><page sequence="4">David Kerner . 230 think is to be full of sorrow/' the beauty of natural order is at least equally incontestable: what but beauty has proved to you the reality of "the invisible world" ("I stood tip-toe," 1. 186) and brought you into your "great Maker's presence" ("Sleep and Poetry," 1. 43)? And this is part of the answer to the one remaining preliminary problem: Why has Keats come to the urn with a question only God can handle? "The principle of beauty in all things" is how "the eternal Being" manifests itself to Keats (2:263; 1:266, 403), so that "from the heart up-springs, rejoice! rejoice! / Sounds which will reach the Framer of all things" ("Sleep and Poetry," 11. 38- 39); and the urn, for Keats, is an especially tangible emissary "from the invisible world" because she radiates "the Greek spirit, -the Religion of the Beautiful, the Religion of Joy, as he used to call it," writes Severn.6 In addition, "Thou, silent form" tells us that the urn has acquired a family likeness to one of her foster parents, the enigmatic "silence" of "the eternal Being." This as- sociation is made explicit when Coelus addresses Hyperion as "earth-born / And sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries / All unre- vealed even to the powers / Which met at thy creating" (if, I. 309-12)- "Powers" that are "silent as a consecrated urn" (E, III.30-32). Further still, from the association revealed by the simile Keats canceled in Endymion at III.32 (above)- "silent, as a corpse upon a pyre"7- we infer that the "consecrated urn" he substituted is a burial urn, which, we may assume, the urn in the ode is, for the silence of God is the silence of death. And since Keats cannot help seeing as feminine that "shape" he stresses (11. 5, 41), the rounded enclosure suggesting the swelling womb (which inspires the irony of "unravish'd bride"), the urn becomes a womb that paradoxically holds funeral ash and consequently represents the earth and the world,8 the paradoxical world to which Keats brings his question, as though the mind of the world might answer. I Confirming and developing the ode's central, unspoken question, Keats quietly builds a submerged structure to resolve it, a struc- ture we notice first in the interplay between the question and the heifer's "lowing at the skies" a cry hardly less articulate than Endymion's "No, I will shout, / Until the gods through heaven's blue look out!" (III.267-68).9 The heifer's complaint is especially appropriate because the townspeople themselves are soliciting divine protection but assume God to be "a friend to man" not to</page><page sequence="5">Evil in the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" . 231 animals. The anthropomorphism is betrayed all the more by a rite that, designed to assure the worshipers an afterlife (as revealed in the mysteries of Eleusis), denies the heifer her right to this life; the lowing is in ironic counterpoint to the human appeal. The irony tells us that the allegedly sanctioned dominion of man over beast is an assertion of force like any other in the animal king- dom. The presumption that humanity warrants God's exclusive concern is a mask for brutality. Hypocrisy shines from the gar- lands and silken flanks meant to direct God's attention not to the heifer but to the supplicants' devotion. The injustice is quietly magnified by Keats's overt response to the preceding scene: if piper, lover, and boughs are permanently "happy," the heifer's anxiety is permanent too as she stands forever on the verge of slaughter; immunity to process has caught her at the wrong mo- ment, for only death could make her happy. Of Moneta, Keats says that her "wan face" is "bright blanch'd / By an immortal sickness" that "happy death / Can put no end to" (FH, 1.256-60). This "happy death" is buried between lines ostensibly rhapsodiz- ing over "happy, happy love" because Keats will not badger us, as we see from his concealment of the gleaming knife he had ex- hibited in "Titian colors" a year before in the verse-letter to Rey- nolds, which was not for publication. But Keats's reserve in the ode is even more subtle. Despite hunger and danger, every animal, bird, or insect, Keats habitually thought, is unconscious of a sep- arate being; it feels at one with the universe: the bees in "To Autumn" "think warm days will never cease"; and that the night- ingale is "not born for death" means that it cannot think about the meaning of death, for it is a "senseless, tranced thing" ("Bards of passion and of mirth," 1. 18). But the scenes Keats imagines for the urn give that oneness not to the heifer but to the "men or gods," whose "wild ecstasy" shows them as much at home in nature as the "immortal" "Dryad of the trees." Keats has ironi- cally reversed his customary contrast of alienated man and inte- grated animal: the domesticated heifer is another "foster-child." The quietness with which this use of the heifer raises the ode's central question warns us not to infer a tainted reforming zeal here. All Keats's pleasure in eating game (2:64-65, 261, 271) and hunting it (2:9, 18)- which smoothed his acceptance of the animal condition, for he granted that the balance of nature would be up- set if animals were denied their living food (2:79)- establishes the disinterestedness that permitted him to see that condition as monstrous when he "saw / Too far into the sea." The man who writes that "pain / Clings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth / On the deer's tender haunches" (Ε, Ι.907-08) and who imagines</page><page sequence="6">David Kerner . 232 the "Dragon's tail, / Long sever'd, yet still hard with agony" (in the canceled stanza of the 'Ode on Melancholy ")10 has concluded that the divine silence cannot be broken for man, since it is not broken for animals. Now, whether or not Keats intends some degree of sentience in the "happy" tree and brook of "In drear nighted December,"11 the ode does not contrast lovers and trees. It joins them: the carved boughs have the same advantage over actual boughs that the lover and piper have over Keats. So Keats for the moment must be pretending to believe (or does believe or can conceive of believing) that trees in fall and winter do feel and can lament their loss. (The "advantage," of course, is ironic.) Because the heifer's anxiety reverses Keats's characteristic notion that animals are unconscious of death, we are invited to find equally unexception- able the implied reversal of the leafless tree's "happy" insentience or memoryless sentience in "In drear nighted December." To re- sist this invitation is to forget how readily vegetation springs to Keats's mind as a way to dramatize the universality of the prob- lem of evil: "suppose a rose to have sensation," he writes; that innocent rose would inevitably experience pain, loss, death (2:101). The boughs on the urn serve the same purpose: Keats is suppos- ing them "happy" so that the urn, and we, may conceive (for the moment, at least) that vegetation too suffers "the Burden of the Mystery."12 Keats encourages this empathy by imagining the boughs' un- ending spring, which, in company with the piper's and lover's permanent happiness, evokes that Golden Age when (as in "Mother of Hermes") heaven and the primrose listened to the poet. Now we cannot believe in the metamorphosis of a human being into a tree (to which the first scene on the urn alludes); fallen man drags the earth down with him, as in Hyperion, where "A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more" (LU).13 That the "happy boughs" are Unfällen explains why the urn can "express / A flow- ery tale more sweetly than our rhyme." The lost world of the "Ode to Psyche," when "holy were the haunted forest boughs," stands before us as soon as Keats asks the urn, "What leaf· f ring' d legend haunts about thy shape[?]" Two years before, he had written Rey- nolds, "The passage in Lear- 'Do you not hear the Sea?'- has haunted me intensely"; and the sonnet "On the Sea," which fol- lows in the letter, ends, "Sit ye near some old cavern's mouth and brood / Until ye start, as if the sea nymphs quired" (1:132). For Keats to take Edgar's matter-of-fact "hear" metaphysically, he must have been always listening for the melodies to which we are deaf but which very ancient Greeks could hear. The palace in</page><page sequence="7">Evil in the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn" . 233 "Lamia"- where the guests hear "A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone / Supportress of the faery-roof"- vanishes because the rationalism of Apollonius can "Empty the haunted air" (11.122- 23, 236). The reason the "legend" that "haunts about" the urn is "leaf-fring'd," then, is not historical accuracy: Moneta, address- ing a modern poet, speaks of "the wind, / Whose language is to thee a barren noise, / Though it blows legend-laden through the trees'9 (Fif, II.4-6). The "leaf-fring'd legend," "happy boughs," and "forest branches" (1. 43) carry Keats back to when vegetation offered communion with the divine, a time of intuitive religious naturalism (rooted in man's recognition of his dependence on the earth) that Keats sees as rational. So Keats is willing to believe that plants and trees may be sentient and therefore subject to pain.14 Before we dismiss this as pathetic fallacy, we should realize that the ode does not stop there: Keats addresses the stone shell of the little town tenderly, as though the deserted houses and streets themselves do not know but humanly long to know why "not a soul" has ever come back.15 Twice we hear this animating tenderness: in Keats' s use of second person, which transforms the echo of "little town" into an affectionate diminutive;16 and in "desolate," which, when we are guided by the diminutive, tells us how the "little town" feels as well as how it looks.17 This too, to some extent, is new for Keats. In "In drear nighted December" the contrast between the leafless tree's lack of memory and man's painful memory was not enough, so Keats added the brook. In "How fever'd is the man," Keats again paired water and plant, to assert that their unconsciousness of mortality is the condition of health we lose in pursuing fame. At the end of the verse-letter to Reynolds, Keats was even ready to become mineral ("I'd sooner be a clapping bell / To some Kamschatkan missionary church"); his vision of "eternal fierce destruction" was so unbearable that the iron unconsciousness of a tail-wagging mere tool of mindless affirmation was preferable. Keats has such "happy" unconscious- ness in mind in the ode because he is appealing for relief from "the Burden of the Mystery," but he is drawn to reverse his usual attitude: in part by his equally characteristic empathy with every- thing in nature, in part by a notion of how the problem of evil might be resolved. That this reversal does not follow the orderly descent of animal-vegetable-mineral indicates only that heifer and town must be joined in a stanza of their own, since the perma- nence Keats imagines for both is altogether im"happy."18 On a letter to his sister 13 March 1819 Keats had used the well- known seal (2:46n) that shows a lyre saying, "Qui me néglige me</page><page sequence="8">David Kerner· 234 désole" (for two of its strings are broken). If this neglected lyre can be "desolate" (and Keats seems to have liked the sentimental animation), why not the abandoned little town? Keats could the more easily associate them because it was a lyre Amphion used in inspiring stones to assemble themselves into the walls of Thebes {E, III. 461). The neglected little town, which will inevitably crum- ble, endlessly longs for the return of that race of magical beings who, like Amphion, had known how to fulfill the dumb longings of unhewn stone.19 Similarly, Keats tells the moon- which "Kiss[es] dead things to life"- "Innumerable mountains rise, and rise, / Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes" (Ε, ΙΙΙ.57-60).20 And we have external evidence that this is more than poetic license. When Keats "affirms that he can conceive of a billiard Ball that it may have a sense of delight from its own roundness, smooth- ness (&amp; very) volubility. &amp; the rapidity of its motion" (1:389, 147n; KC, 1:59, 275n), the remark is a premeditated attack on Newtonian mechanics, which regularly used billiard balls to illustrate natural law in a clocklike world.21 Keats could write from Scotland, "What astonishes me more than any thing is the tone, coloring, the slate, the stone, the moss, the rock-weed; or, if I may so say, the intel- lect, the countenance of such places" (1:301). So we must take seriously his perception, in the verse-letter to Reynolds, that the lake, the "little isles," the mountains, the rills in the "Enchanted Castle" look alive to love and hate, To smiles and frowns; they seem a lifted mound Above some giant, pulsing underground. (11. 35-40)22 That "giant" explains the "little town" by way of the Hyperion Titans; when Keats describes their "Dungeon'd" "limbs / Lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd" (11.23-25), he sug- gests that the Titans are the earth. This is why he opens with Saturn "quiet as a stone"; why the speech of Oceanus is the sound of water- "Murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue / Caught infant-like from the far^foamed sands" (11.171-72); and why Coelus says, "My life is but the life of winds and tides" (1.341), just as Hyperion, when he would like to bring up the dawn before its time, finds that "The sacred seasons might not be disturbed" (I. 293) because he has no powers apart from theirs. Nonetheless, those powers are divine: Keats calls FingaTs Cave "this Cathe- dral of the Sea"- "For solemnity and grandeur it far surpasses the finest Cathedrall" (1:350, 349)- and he compares Saturn and</page><page sequence="9">Evil in the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn" . 235 Thea to "natural sculpture in cathedral cavern" (1.86; and see 1: 348, 2:198). The consciousness of the "little town" manifests this divinity of the mineral world. II But something more than empathy and pantheism has encouraged Keats to extend the sorrows of consciousness to animal, vegetable, and mineral. He is not merely echoing Greek and Hebrew mythol- ogy when he says that the "flesh" of man is "Near cousin to the common dust" (FH, 1.109-10), that man is "impassioned clay" (the sonnet on Lear) or "Promethean clay" (E, IV.955), that Venus is "the ooze-born goddess" (III.893), and that Saturn's "bow'd head seem'd listening to the Earth, / His ancient mother, for some comfort yet" (H, I.20-21). Just as, in Endymion, the "serene fa- ther" of organic leaves is the inorganic sun (IV.929), so, in Hy- perion, the theodicy Oceanus offers is a literal genealogy: "Say, doth the dull soil [that "ancient mother"] / Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed[1]"; "our fair boughs / Have bred forth" eagles (11.217-26). These lines, even as a metaphor, transform the tradi- tionally static chain of being into a chain of becoming: Oceanus is saying that human consciousness did not descend from above, by anthropomorphic fiat, but evolved naturally from below.23 To answer Apollo's question "Where is power?" (if, III. 103), Keats has Endymion plunge first into the "silent mysteries of earth" in search of its "buried magic" (Ε, ΙΙ.214, 900), for the romantic poet-apostle must undergo initiation by working his way through the elements, those "four fairies" whose mysterious seed power or power of metamorphosis permitted this paradise of a world, and the human imagination, to flower from the chemistry of chaos, though in ever so "slow time."24 Only this evolutionary "buried magic" of the elements explains Keats 's insistence on attributing dreams (which, for him, reveal creative power) to every level of the chain of being: "sleeping kine" "dream of fields divine" (25, III.57-58); "Tall oaks" "dream all night without a stir" (i/, 1.74- 75); rocks seem "Ever as if just rising from a sleep" (11.10-11), like Ailsa Rock, which "the mighty Power bid / . . . heave to airy sleep from fathom dreams" (1:330); and Keats "talks / To the trees and mountains" ("Sleep and Poetry," 11. 136-37) as he does to Ailsa Rock: to penetrate those "Mysteries / All unrevealed" of "the mighty Power."25 In the ode the evolutionary rise of the consciousness Keats at- tributes to animal, vegetable, and mineral emerges from his ex- pectation that an appeal for theodicy will elicit from a divine</page><page sequence="10">David Kerner . 236 emissary (as in Paradise Lost) an account of the history of the world, including the origin and destiny of man. This account has been altogether overlooked. Nothing indicates that the urn shows where the round of scenes begins, yet Keats presents them in an order we do not find arbitrary, and he calls the urn a historian. Why, then, do we fail to look for chronology in the arrangement? From goatish lust, man rises through romantic devotion, which is still possessive and ego centered (and * 'leaves a heart high-sorrow- ful"), to the voluntary sacrifice of that goatishness and self (ritual- ized in the sacrifice of goats or heifers).26 One must not make the common mistake of confusing the first of the three scenes with the second.27 "Arcady," "maidens loth/' and "struggle to escape" remind us of "how fair trembling Syrinx fled / Arcadian Pan [naked, of course], with such a fearful dread" ("I stood tip-toe," 11. 157-58; E, 1.242-45); and so violent a pursuer is no romantic martyr who, when permanently frustrated, can be reassured, "yet, do not grieve," "Forever wilt thou love, and she be fair!" In stanzas 2 and 3 the pipes are "soft," and there are no timbrels (Bacchus is traditionally noisy), no "wild ecstasy," no crowd, no nakedness (since the lover closing for a kiss is "Bold"), and no fearful flight.28 The conspicuous omission of questions in these stanzas shows that Keats has nothing explicit to ask here: this is the world he mainly lives in. The distinctiveness and significance of the first scene are fur- ther clarified by its difference from the third. In "Arcady," under the aegis of Pan, man lived on acorns, like squirrels, without need to store the surplus because "warm days will never cease." The unbridled sexuality of the males in stanza 1 radiates a correspond- ing psychological harmony, of mind and body, of self and the out- side world. This is why Keats wonders, twice, whether the pur- suers are "men or gods": the "ecstasy" that admits them alone to the world of the nightingale (nowhere else in his poems does the word appear) tells us that the first scene dramatizes the essence of Pan. That essence is man as he was in the beginning, more animal than man and therefore godlike in that he had not yet lost the nightingale's feeling of immortality, since he was unable to ques- tion his death any more than his nakedness, for he had not learned to speak.29 In other words, Keats, who took "scripture" to be "fig- urative" (2:67), understood that Adam and Eve were "immortal" as long as they did not know they were naked, that is, as long as they still were, or thought like, animals. Expulsion into the world of death was not a supernatural punishment but the price the new species naturally paid as their "fall" into expanded consciousness came to be usable.30 This naturalistic understanding of Genesis</page><page sequence="11">Evil in the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn" . 237 explains the Hyperion poems as Keats's updating of Paradise Lost. In "the infant world" of the Titans (if, 1.26), "there is no death in all the universe," and later "there shall be death" be- cause primal unconsciousness has been overthrown: "Fate / Had pour'd a mortal oil upon [Saturn's] head, / A disanointing poison" (FH, 1.423-24; H, II.96-98). Knowledge of death-and, along with it, of transgression, as consciousness invades the kingdom of instinct31- makes the townspeople on the urn inconceivable as gods. Docilely they follow their mysterious priest in an anxious attempt to regain what man has lost. Knowing what the night- ingale has never known, they can only long for immortality. They foreshadow the Christianity that will subordinate this world to the next, though their altar is still green.32 How this biological and historical evolution of the human race is set in the context of organic and cosmic evolution, we begin to understand when we see the precision in Keats's calling that lost world "of the early gods" "the infant world," where Hyperion clings to "this cradle of my glory" (1.51, 236). To gorge on "Those dainties made to still an infant's cries" ("Isabella," 1. 374)- those "milky sovereignties" where one "swoon'd / Drunken from plea- sure's nipple" {E, 11.759, 868-69)- is to know "earth's only para- dise" ("Fill for me a brimming bowl," 1. 16); for there (as Keats surmised, from his endless sensuousness), we recapitulate, as much as we can, the quasi-divine "wild ecstasy" of the human race's animal infancy. The self-replenishing breast is always so ready with the peace of satiation (celebrated in the "Ode on Indolence" and "Bright star") that we feel that breast as part of our own body: outer and inner world are one, and there are no prohibitions.33 The Titans' fall, then, from their "infant world" into history- the fall brought into the world by Mnemosyne, goddess of memory- represents, side by side with that primal human fall, our own individual falls into wider consciousness, beginning with our loss of the animal paradise of infancy. To each of us, therefore, it can be said, as is said to Saturn, "heaven is parted from thee, and the earth / Knows thee not, so afflicted for a God" (FH, 1.357-58); and in each of us the old divinities, though beaten back, survive and struggle to regain power. In the ode this parallel is empha- sized by the nostalgic envy in Keats's excited response to the first scene. But "mad pursuit" and "maidens loth" suggest that the nostalgia may be rooted in still older sources of our being. Pan's "hairy legs and feet," Keats had read in Lemprière, "de- noted the inferior parts of the earth, such as the woods and plants"; and "Arcady" and Tempe are where Daphne and Syrinx, Keats's models for "maidens loth," were transformed into plants, the</page><page sequence="12">David Kerner . 238 mode of metamorphosis transposing the primitive intuition that man had originally grown out of the earth.34 By these allusions, in the context of the "happy boughs" and mourning town, the first scene opens up the long series of evolutionary ' 'falls" that Hype- rion collapses into a single fall. Keats can take part in the com- plaint of the heifer and the lament of shedding trees that moves him to hail the "happy boughs," and he can make the "desola- tion" of Saturn (FH, 1.227) literal in the "desolate" shell of the little town because one chain of loss binds animal, vegetable, and mineral to man as the access of being, however unequally, casts them out of their former home and loads them increasingly with "the Burden of the Mystery." Keats, following Wordsworth's Immortality Ode, has naturalized the Plotinian theology of ema- nation from a loving godhead. One more reason he feels himself in the presence of that godhead is that the urn, as a "speaking" work of art made from marble,35 is an emblem of the metamorphic rise from mineral to man. In answer to Keats 's unspoken question, the urn can now say that "truth [is] beauty": the "power" that runs the world is an endless, inconceivable power of beauty, before which man must bow. For in the very existence of such a world, man's "need to know" whether God exists is met. As far as you, circumscribed by the "grand march of intellect," can understand (1:282; cf. FH, II.1-2), "God" is that endlessly creative power, out of which everything comes. Why have you attributed consciousness to your empty houses and streets if not to display the seed power that ultimately brought Socrates and Shakespeare out of the mineral matrix of being? In this living, evolving cosmos, no one, no "thing," is a "foster-child," no matter how everything suffers. Humanity, with its consciousness rooted in the animal, vegetable, and mineral world, is no less at home here than the nightingale. Human consciousness makes people even more marvelously at home. The theodicy Keats has taught the urn invites her, he sees, to take possession of the town, as though this image were a vision of the earth as home, a consciously mothering shelter, the first and foremost "friend to man" (which tells us why the word ecology comes from the Greek oikos, "house"). Ill This climax of the urn's "flowery tale" makes the "little town" the climactic oxymoron in all Keats's work, for the will to see in the town a vision of the earth as humanity's friendly home boom- erangs: the ghost town takes on all the desolation of a ghost</page><page sequence="13">Evil in the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn" . 239 earth, inextricably intertwining in a single image the miraculous rise of the chain of being and its inescapable tragic end. Now we can understand the locations Keats imagines for the town. They evoke ancient legends of recurring cataclysm: mountain dwellers might hope to survive the next universal flood, while river and seashore might provide protection from heaven-sent fire, the solar system disruptions that Plato says the story of Phaeton mytholo- gizes. Keats finds those legends warranted: the "peaceful citadel," betraying the immediately practical reason for such a location- a history of massacre, mass rape, and slavery36- speaks to Keats not of a mothering ecosystem but of one that depends on slaughter ("the robin . . . / Ravening a worm," verse-letter to Reynolds, 11. 104-05; cf. 2:79). Man will no more eliminate "the Poles and . . . the sands of Africa, Whirlpools and volcanoes" than the fish will "philosophise the ice away from the Rivers in winter time" (2:101). Between the lines "When old age shall this generation waste, I Thou shalt remain," we are meant, then, to hear this question: If the urn were real, how many more generations could it resist the "rude / Wasting of old time" ("On Seeing the Elgin Marbles")? And this tells us that in Keats's conception of the urn, the omission of the town is an attempt to forestall any in- timation of the slow crumbling of houses uninhabited "for ever- more," a crumbling that would speak (to whom?) of a race that had left its mark but had not known how to surmount the ob- stacles to its lasting survival (though the urn claims we know all we need to). For the final corollary of the death that, by wasting each generation, exposes the paradoxical indifference of the cos- mos to the love and genius it creates is the ultimate disappear- ance of man. One day everything that could speak of him will be gone too ("the last syllable of recorded time")37 "until the firma- ment / Outblackens Erebus, and the full-cavern'd earth / Crumbles into itself" (E, IV.120-22). For Keats, "a time must come when every thing will leave not a wrack behind" (1:142). 38 It is this "feud / Twixt Nothing and Creation" (Ε, III.40-41) that Keats, in the Lear sonnet, sees as "our deep eternal theme!" He calls "golden-tongued Romance" "Fair plumed syren" because "The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of the nightingale."39 Inevitably the veil of Maya is lifted, to reveal Medusa, the barren landscape that confirms the knight's nightmare in "La Belle Dame sans Merci."40 From this paradox- for the dream of enchanting beauty and the nightmare of annihilation are equally real- Keats can only conclude that "the mighty Power" is no more conscious than Ailsa Rock: it cannot even know, much less care, about the creatures it somehow engenders. "Ethereal things," Keats had</page><page sequence="14">David Kerner · 240 thought, "Can make a ladder of the eternal wind/' to take one to "the doors / Of heaven" (Ε, III.25-26; 1.581-82), "As once fair angels on a ladder flew / From the green turf to heaven" (FHy 1.134-36). But in mid-1818, at the top of Ben Nevis, "I look over- head, / And there is sullen mist; even so much Mankind can tell of heaven." And at the end of 1819, "I rais'd / My eyes" to find all "ending in mist / Of nothing" (FH, 1.81-85). The chain of be- ing, rising from below, leaves us stranded. Instead of looking up, we must look down. This need to look down is not new for Keats; the "large eagle" that rescues Endymion when, "Abrupt, in mid- dle air, his way was lost," lands him on earth "In the greenest nook," for man's solace must be "the sun, the moon, / Trees" "and clear rills," "A flowery band to bind us to the earth" (11.656-69; 1.13-16; cf. IV.126-29). But in 1817 Keats was willing to identify this solace as paradise, a marriage with divinity in the "pure Ely- sium" to which Endymion ascends (IV.658). Two years later, the ode's chain of suffering animal, vegetable, and mineral is dictated, ultimately, by Keats's need to redefine the solace the poet feels when he "talks / To the trees and mountains"- like Saturn "list'n- ing to the Earth, / His ancient mother, for some comfort yet." Not a "flowery band," but a tragic solidarity binds man to the abandoned cosmos imaged in the deserted houses and streets- the abandonment that makes our "faery lands forlorn." But if the primal seed power must be unconscious and therefore without intention, there is no problem of evil: contention then springs naturally from the world's elements ("that strife," says Saturn, "Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep," H, 11.147-48). Those forlorn, unfathered "four fairies" are blameless. This world of unsponsored contention enters the ode in "marble men and women," which tells us that death is no evil, since, with- out that end, there could be no beginning. "April" and "shroud" (in the "Ode on Melancholy") are one. Keats's problem would now be settled if only he were not still of the "dreamer tribe" (FH, 1.198), a "spiritual Cottager" who "has knowledge of the terra semi incognita of things unearthly; and cannot for his Life, keep in the check rein" (1.255).41 Since the sorrowing of the little town manifests ultimate mystery by mirroring the miraculous rise of human consciousness out of a primal nothing, Keats shows that he agrees with the urn that the secularization of nature begs the question: replacing "God" with unconscious "natural law" does not explain why the ooze should give birth to Venus, or why blind appetite at the bottom of the sea should evolve into the conscious- ness that, like Job's, sees in the world's magnificence an ethical imperative. How can intention be denied the divinity of that evo-</page><page sequence="15">Evil in the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" . 241 lutionary power? Yet there is no escaping the world's horror, which previsions the ultimate horror of cosmic death. Miracle and horror stand in endless deadlock. That is why "tease" in the ode's last stanza echoes the verse-letter to Reynolds. Keats must still la- ment, "Oh never will the prize, / High reason, and the lore of good and ill, / Be my award" (11. 74-76). Because the urn is part of Keats's mind, all the flying argu- ments of this exchange have been compressed into a moment (like Mahomet's "fortnight's trip," 1:358-59), thereby becoming al- most as elusive as the allegorical figures in the "Ode on Indo- lence," "whom," Keats said, when they first appeared to him, "no one but myself could distinguish in their disguisement" (2:79). But only this unresolved debate with himself bridges the break in tone between the last two stanzas; Keats comes away from the desolate town in high spirits because the urn has drawn from him a new solace, which softens his tragic skepticism into the irony in the punning delight that opens the last stanza. For other rea- sons, too, Keats does not openly contest the urn's aphorism. As in "Sleep and Poetry" (11. 241-47, 267-68), he still wants to "[pour] out a balm upon the world," not "[vex] it" (FH, 1.201-02). He will not parade his "half seeing" at "the very bourne of Heaven" (1:224): "Man should not dispute or assert but whisper results to his neighbor" (1:232). Keats is content that, with the image of the ghost town still haunting about the urn when her speech is finished, enough read- ers will see that "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" conspicuously omits the good. Keats has taught himself again that the world's beauty, no matter how palpably it manifests divinity, cannot take from man "the Burden of the Mystery." No theodicy can be more than a "pious fraud," for "It is impossible to prove that black is white, It is impossible to make out, that sorrow is joy or joy is sorrow" (1:358). Keats finds Voltaire a man worth bowing to be- cause Voltaire, ridiculing the callousness of theodicy, joins those who, "like slaves to poor humanity, / Labour for mortal good" {FH, 1.158-59)- a labor that makes "the human friend Philoso- pher" "the most genuine Being in the World" (2:139). Not poetry but "fine doing" is "the top thing in the world" (2:146). The urn speaks only for poetry. What rescues her from her foster home is "quietness," Keats's word for absorption by imagination, by "those abstractions which are my only life" (1:370): art counters the "silence" of the cosmos with the "quietness" of the mind, the "wide quietness" of Keats's sanctuary for Psyche. This "is not so fine a thing as philosophy" because that "quietness" is essen- tially an eagle, a "sea-bird"; it is all grace of animal energy and</page><page sequence="16">David Kerner . 242 reflects the amoral beauty of nature (2:80-81; "What can I do to drive away/' 11. 11-17). Accordingly, it can never tear out "the burrs, / And thorns of life" ("Sleep and Poetry," 11. 244-51). Keats says, "Were it in my choice I would reject a petrarchal coronation -on accou[n]t of my dying day, and because women have Can- cers" (1:292). Of these limits to her authority, the urn does not speak. As a "still unravish'd bride," she does not know that her rescue is incomplete. Elkins Park, Pennsylvania Notes 1. That the period after the aphorism and the Τ in "That" in the Annals ver- sion are once again a comma and lowercase t in the 1820 collection- as in three of the four transcripts (including Charles Brown's, which Jack Stillinger estab- lishes as closest to the lost holograph)- confirms that there is only one speaker in Unes 49-50. Both of Stillinger' s attempts to undermine the importance of Brown's transcript- by demonstrating the unreliability of Brown's transcription of Keats's punctuation elsewhere and by arguing that, even if Brown's punctu- ating of line 49 was faithful, Keats could later have changed his mind- are ir- relevant, since the final version, which Stillinger says that "we must assume that Keats was responsible for," restores the crucial comma and lowercase t of Brown's transcript. Further confirmation is apparent when we deduce that Keats cannot have foreseen the confusion the quotation marks would occasion, for he could not have thought them worth the confusion: as long as we assume he added or approved them, they must be taken as merely emphasizing or clarifying the antecedent of "that," or indicating that "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" echoes what the world already knows or someone has said (as a reader of the Annals may have claimed)- Shaftesbury, perhaps (see Harry M. Solomon, "Shaftesbury's Characteristics and the Conclusion of Ode on a Grecian Urn,' " Keats-Shelley Journal 24 [1975]: 89-101), if not Boileau or Akenside. Writing to his publishers about errors in the copy-editing of Endymion, Keats recommends line-by-line identification of quotes within quotes (1:271)- but he does not believe that the convention of inverted commas is always necessary: there are none in either the Annals version of the ode or any of the transcripts, just as there are none in "La Belle Dame sans Merci" and none for the long diary entry at lines 642-787 of The Jealousies (as often in Keats's letters). So, at the end of the ode, Keats thought quotes within quotes were not needed, for the last two Unes were clearly a single speech: the urn alone, addressed as an oracle, has the authority to say what can and cannot be known on earth; and the speech is introduced (making outer quotation marks as unnecessary as in Milton). Besides, as an inferred speech, the lines no more call for quotation marks than the "rejoice! rejoice!" heard "from the heart" in "Speech and Poetry" (1. 38). For further argument, see Alvin Whitley, "The Message of the Grecian Urn," Keats-Shelley Memorial Bulletin 5 (1953): 1-3, and Jack Stillinger 's The Hoodwinking of Madeline and Other Essays on Keats's Poems (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1971), 166-73, and The Texts of Keats's Poems (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), 245-47.</page><page sequence="17">Evil in the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" . 243 2.

The paradox never left Keats's mind: even while writing his potboiler, The Jealousies, he could not suppress what he had heard and seen at Guy's Hospital- the "mother's screams," the bed that "Shook with her agony," and then the child's beautiful eyes that- in the poem- "ope on the stars serene" (11. 390-96). 5.

See also "Isabella," 11. 115-17, and Otho the Great, 2.1.129-32. 11. Inasmuch as the tree's and brook's unconsciousness of the past complements Keats's nightingale's and bees' unconsciousness of the future (memory and fore- sight are the two sides of the "unhappy" capacity that "forces us in summer skies to mourn," verse-letter to Reynolds, 1. 84), "In drear nighted December" may be asking us to consider the possibility of that "green felicity" and "sweet forget- ting." John Jones 'John Keats's Dream of Truth [New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1969], 37) believes that this poem ends with Keats's boast of having expressed something new to literature; but "was never said in rhyme" means "is not now being said," "cannot be said"- the meaning that Woodhouse kept when he ended his revision "Not to be told in Rhyme," though, illogically, he misapplied it to human consciousness of loss (as in the unauthorized line Garrod adopted, "To know the change and feel it"), somehow missing the "connection" between the halves of the last stanza {KC, 11:64-65). 12. The argument for inferring vegetable consciousness had been presented re- peatedly by Erasmus Darwin, and we should not think that the man who wrote</page><page sequence="18">David Kerner · 244 "suppose a rose to have sensation" was indifferent to that argument, which he must have been exposed to while at Guy's Hospital. Sir Astley Cooper, who took an interest in Keats, was a great admirer of Darwin's (see Desmond King- Hele, Doctor of Revolution: The Life and Genius of Erasmus Darwin [London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1977], 302). Keats's one reference to Darwin does not dismiss him, and numerous parallels (a few of which are noted below) show Keats's famili- arity with Darwin's work. Darwin claims that "vegetables are in reality an in- ferior order of animals" {Phytologia [Dublin, 1800], 2); he even believed that plants may dream (Zoonomia; or, The Laws of Organic Life, 2 vols. [London, 1794; facsimile rpt. New York: AMS Press, 1974], 1:107). And from Robert Bur- ton's The Anatomy of Melancholy, Keats would borrow not only the germ of "Lamia" but also the way palm trees make love, leaning toward each other (Allott, ed., II.125-30n). 13. Owen Bar field {Romanticism Comes of Age [Middleton, Conn.: Wesley an University Press, 1967], citing Paradise Lost, IX.782-84) comments: "Natural Science is the study of fallen nature carried on by fallen man" (214). This is why earth, water, and air feel the loss when Saturn falls (H, I.55-59; see below). 14. In the fairy tale by Brown for which Keats wrote "Shed no tear," the soul of a king's murdered son transmigrates into a flower; and when one of his brothers plucks it, "it drooped, it withered," and "the dead [prince's] voice rises in the air, moaning, 'Ah! who has been so cruel?' " (see Jack Stillinger, "The Context of Keats's 'Fairy's Song,' " Keats-Shelley Journal 10 (1961): 6, and Ovid, Meta- morohoses. VIII.739-72. IX.376-81. 11.361-63). 15. I refer to the town as stone so that the vegetable origins of wood and the vegetable content of earth will not obscure the point. 16. Keats s addressing the urn too in second person and his making it a young woman he refers to as "who," do not animate the urn (for though it "speaks," we know that Keats is speaking for it), since the complex metaphors Keats uses as his articles of address to the urn turn it into an abstraction. 17. Although no interpretation of the ode can be successful that does not con- front the fact that Keats has made the empty houses and streets conscious (and that does not then make a real effort to understand why this should give the passage its profound effect), only a few critics acknowledge the fact, and no one has connected it with the heifer's complaint and the "happy boughs," perhaps from fear of seeming ridiculous, as though one might be accused of transmogrify- ing the ode into a round of twenty questions. Lilian Haddakin ("Keats's Ode on a Grecian Urn' and Hazlitt's Lecture On Poetry in General,' " Notes and Queries 197 [29 Mar. 1952]: 146) writes that the little town "can never know why it is deso- late': it is left in perpetual suspense"; George Clayburn Gross ("Keats's 'Pré- sider': The Influence of Shakespeare on Keats" [Ph.D. diss., University of South- ern California, 1963], 217-18) refers to the empathy permitting Keats "to imagine what other people and things- like the town- must experience"; Blair G. Kenney (The Explicator 27 [May 1969]: item 69) asserts that Keats "imagines the feelings of the 'little town' " but that Keats is thereby "half making fun" of his "incor- rigible" imagination; Stuart A. Ende {Keats and the Sublime [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976], 138) says Keats "cannot heal the desolation of the town. . . . But he gives it the gift of feeling, a modicum of recompense for its fall into silence"; John J. Teunissen and Evelyn J. Hinz (" 'Ode on a Grecian Urn': Keats's 'Laocoön,' " English Studies in Canada 6 [Summer 1980]: 191-92, 195) say that "Keats's personification of the small town might be considered an instance of animism," and they refer to the town's "mourning" but see this as only one more demonstration of their thesis that the ode is about poetry's advantages over plastic art- "the controlling irony" in "not a soul to tell / Why thou art</page><page sequence="19">Evil in the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn" . 245 desolate" "is that the poet has just explained why the little town is 'desolate.' " Cleanth Brooks ("Keats' s Sylvan Historian: History without Footnotes," in The Well Wrought Urn [1947; rpt. New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World (Harvest), n.d.]) ventures to defend what is evidently the common assumption: that only a human being can be the omitted indirect object of "tell." Keats, Brooks decides, must be thinking of some stranger wandering into the town as though it were real. This interpretation is unacceptable because it would remain unchanged if Keats were speaking of the town, in third person, and because the only reason the streets must stay silent forever is that Keats is addressing them as they might have been on the urn; he is correcting the imaginary carver's omission (see G. Wilson Knight, The Starlit Dome [London, 1941; rpt. London: Oxford University Press, 1971], 295). Helen Vendler {The Odes of John Keats [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983]) feels "indescribable pathos" in "the tender second-person address" to the town (144) but explains, "What is excluded on the urn"- town and altar- is "what we cannot ever know- whence we came, whither we are go- ing, those mysteries of eternity"- and Keats "displaces his fear of death onto the abandoned town [i.e., onto the 'whence'], which itself takes on the qualities of the life we shall have vacated when we die" (142). So Vendler, like others before her who were tyrannized by "pathetic fallacy," attributes the pathos to projection; but what makes that pathos "indescribable" if there is thus no mystery in Keats's pity for the empty town's suffering? 18. The same chain of alienation appears in "When they were come unto the Faery's Court": the woods are "so lone and wild" that "even the Robin feels himself exild" and "the very brooks as if affraid / Hurry along to some less magic shade" (2:85). 19. In Erasmus Darwin, "congealing rocks "Court the mce chissel, and desire to breathe" {The Botanic Garden, Part I: The Economy of Vegetation [London, 1791; facsimile rpt. New York and London: Garland, 1978], 11.99-100); and he identifies these rocks as ranging "from the coarse lime-stones to the finest mar- bles" (II.93n). He informs us too that "living rocks of worm-built coral breathe" (III.90). 20. The Unes combine Darwin's "to the moon each sparkling mountain gleams" and "Impetuous steams in spiral columns rise / Through rifted rocks, impatient for the skies" {The Botanic Garden, Part II: The Loves of the Plants, 2d ed. [London, 1790; facsimile rpt. New York and London: Garland, 1978], IV.344, 177-78; see also^K III.161-62). 21. Hazlitt writes that "the necessarians have always delighted to illustrate the operations of the mind in volition by referring to the impulse communicated by one billiard-ball to another" ("On Liberty and Necessity," in The Complete Works of William Hazlitt, ed. P. P. Howe [London: J. M. Dent, 1931], 2:269); see Rollins, ed., Letters, l:147n. See also Bernard Blackstone, The Consecrated Urn (London: Longmans, 1958), 12, and H. W. Piper, The Active Universe (London: Athlone Press, 1962), 9. For other examples of Keats's readiness to animate the mineral world, see 1:289-90, 2:196. 22. Of the army of Cambyses invading Ethiopia, Darwin writes, Now ο er their head the whizzing whirlwinds breathe, / And the live desert pants, and heaves beneath" {EV, 11.473-74); and he compares the earth's water cycle to the circulation of the blood (III. 11-56). For the French and British influences (in- cluding Darwin's) on Wordsworth's openness to hylozoism, and its influence on Keats, see Piper, 19-25, 69-74, 149-64; what Piper says about "The Poet" is still applicable if one believes the poem about Keats rather than by him (see Mabel A. E. Steele, "The Authorship of The Poet' and Other Sonnets," Keats- Shelley Journal 5 [1956]: 69-80).</page><page sequence="20">David Kerner . 246 23. Edward Thomas {Keats [London: T. C. &amp; E. Jack (1914)], 82) writes that Keats "had a profound feeling for the history and evolution of his own planet." For Piper, Oceanus's famous lines are "almost the first recorded statement of the doctrine of evolution by natural selection" (193). In British Romantic Poets: Recent Revaluations (New York: New York University Press, 1966), the editor, Shiv Kumar ("The Meaning of Hyperion: A Reassessment," 305-18), suggests that Keats abandoned the Hyperions because Apollo is presented as ultimate perfection, whereas the doctrine expounded by Oceanus calls for the further evolution of beauty. Darwin had conjectured that "all organic life" on earth arose "from one living filament, which THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE endued . . . with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities . . . and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!" (Z, 1:507, 505). But Darwin saw the struggle for survival, in both the vegetable and animal worlds, as another mechanism for the improvement of species (1:503)- "Eat or be eaten" is the law of life (P, 505; see also The Temple of Nature; or, The Origin of Society [London, 1803; facsimile rpt. New York and London: Garland, 1978], IV.369-74). And the wording that Keats gives Oceanus -"on our heels a fresh perfection treads," when paired with the echo in the Nightingale Ode, "No hungry generations tread thee down"- suggests Keats's familiarity with both these aspects of Darwin's random effort to formulate a theory of evolution. (Cf. Blackstone, 326.) "Perhaps," Darwin had written, "all the productions of nature are in their progress to greater perfection!" {TN, III.122n), and he said it over and over (LP, I.65n; EV, I.lOln; P, 515; TN, III.411n). 24. La Belle Dame sans Merci is a fairy s child (i.e., child of an element) as Venus is "the ooze-born goddess" (the "Chorus of Four Fairies" immediately follows "La Belle Dame sans Merci" in Keats's journal-letter of February-May 1819), for La Belle Dame is the enchanting beauty of the world: the knight says, "I set her on my pacing steed, / And nothing else saw all day long," just as, for Keats in 1816, a "sudden glow" puts poets "in such a trance," "nought they see / In water, earth, or air, but poesy" ("To My Brother George," 11. 25, 21-22). Similarly, Darwin saw in the myth of the birth of Venus the ancient Greek in- tuition of the origin of life. He writes, "Nurs'd by warm sun-beams in primeval caves / Organic life began beneath the waves"; "without parent by spontaneous birth / Rise the first specks of animated earth" {TN, 1.233-34, 247-48; and see I.417n and "Additional Notes," 38). 25. Charles Brown writes that a sight of Alisa Rock came upon us like some- thing supernatural" (1:441). G. Wilson Knight, in The Starlit Dome, emphasizes that "Keats's interest in sleep is one with his perception of a kind of conscious- ness within manifestations usually felt to be half-conscious only or quite inani- mate"; "Keats actually surpasses his predecessors in acute perception of ... some almost human vitality in vegetable and earthy life ... ; in, we may say, the very texture of the earthy universe and its elements" (266; and see 303, 271-72, 275, 277, 288). 26. Commenting on a passage m The Anatomy of Melancholy, Keats wonders whether the same word in Greek denotes "goatish winnyish lustful love" and "the abstract adoration of the deity . . . Ha! I see how they endeavour to divide- but there appears to be a horrid relationship" {The Complete Works of John Keats, ed. H. Buxton Forman [Glasgow, 1900; facsimile rpt. New York: AMS Press, 1970], 3:268). Harold Bloom {The Visionary Company, rev. ed.

The differences between the two scenes tell us that "winning near the goal" does not refer to "mad pursuit": it recalls "To woo sweet kisses from averted faces" ("Sleep and Poetry," 1. 106). 29. The lines "While yet our England was a wolfish den; / Before our forests heard the talk of men" (E, IV.4-5)- which probably refer not to the absence of men but to man's original inability to speak- may echo Hobbes: "But the most noble and profitable invention of all other, was that of speech ... ; without which, there had been amongst men, neither commonwealth, nor society, nor contract, nor peace, no more than amongst lions, bears, and wolves" (Leviathan, ed. Michael Oakeshott [Oxford and New York: Basil Blackwell and Macmillan, 1947], 18). 30. In Where s the Poet? "ape," like the other species, must be taken literally: as a metaphor, it would be a callous vulgarism inconsistent with the characteristic empathy the lines claim. No less than Leigh Hunt, then, Keats was aware of the notion that the chimpanzee (then usually called an orangutan) was a degenerate man (see 2:7 In). But Keats knew another explanation of the resemblance. Since "Lamia" shows the influence of Rhododaphne- and "Like a Silenus on an antique vase" (FH, 1.56) echoes "antique Silenus" in Headlong Hall (The Novels of Thomas Love Peacock, ed. David Garnett, 2 vols. [London: Rupert Hart-Davis, 1963], 1:13)- Keats must have seen the quotations from Monboddo and Rousseau in Peacock's notes to the chapter "Sir Oran Haut-ton" in Melincourt (1817). In addition, Emile and the Nouvelle Héloise, in French, were on Keat's shelves, and his parallel of the nightingale and the "men or gods" is implicit in Rousseau's statement that "the man living in primitive simplicity" "neither foresees nor senses death" (Emile; or, On Education, trans, Allan Bloom [New York: Basic Books, 1979], 281). And Keats probably knew Voltaire's comment, in the foot- note ending the entry "Luxe" in the Dictionnaire Philosophique, which also was among Keats's books, that if we call luxury whatever is "au-delà du nécessaire," then "tout ennemi du luxe doit croire avec Rousseau que l'état de bonheur et de vertu pour l'homme est celui, non de sauvage, mais d'orangoutang" (Voltaire's italics). So "What men or gods are these?" may well reflect Keats's acquaintance with Rousseau's revision of the passage Peacock quotes from note j of the Dis- course on the Origins and Foundations of Inequality: Without ceremony our travelers take for beasts, under the names pongos, mandrills, orangutans, the same beings that the ancients under the names satyrs, fauns, sylvans, took for divinities. Perhaps, after more precise re- search, it will be found that they are neither animals nor gods, but men. (The First and Second Discourses, ed. Roger D. Masters [New York: St. Martin's Press, 1964], 209; and see Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Ouvres com- pletes, ed. Bernard Gagnebin and Marcel Raymond, 4 vols. [Paris: Biblio- thèque de la Pléiade, 1959-69], 3:211η) That gives us the "ape" of "Where's the Poet?"; and Keats's next step is plain: we know his interest in Buffon; and Darwin alludes to "philosophers" who, "with Buffon and Helvetius, seem to imagine that mankind arose from one family of monkeys on the banks of the Mediterranean" (TN, II.122n). Besides, such specu- lation was common: as early as 1815, in a letter to Wordsworth (30 May), Cole- ridge deplores "all the countless Believers- even (strange to say) among Xtians of Man's having progressed from an Our an Outang state- so contrary to all</page><page sequence="22">David Kerner · 248 History, to all Religion, nay, to all Possibility" (Collected Letters of Samuel Tay- lor Coleridge, ed. Earl Leslie Griggs, vol. 4 [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1959], 574- 75); and in On the Constitution of the Church and State, Coleridge again ridicules "the Our an Ou tang theology of the origin of the human race, substituted for the Book of Genesis, ch. I.-X." (The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, vol. 10, ed. John Colmer [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1976], 66). 31. In the Metamorphoses, Myrrha, in love with her father, says of horses and cows, "0 happy beasts, to whom such things are permitted!" (X. 319-31, trans, in Arthur O. Lovejoy and George Boas, Primitivism and Related Ideas in An- tiquity [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1935], 400). 32. Raphaels "The Sacrifice at Lystra includes St. Paul (see Robert Gittmgs, The Odes of Keats and Their Earliest Known Manuscripts [Kent: Kent State University Press, 1970], 69). 33. As Christopher Ricks (Keats and Embarrassment [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974], 50-51, 107) points out, infants, like animals, do not blush. The divinity of the animal origin of man (as a species and an infant) appears again in the "im- mortal bower" where a Cupid offers Endymion cream "Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd / For the boy Jupiter" (11.438, 448-49). Keats knew, from Lemprière, that Amalthea "fed Jupiter with goat's milk. Hence some authors have called her a goat, and have maintained that Jupiter . . . gave one of her horns to the nymphs who had taken care of his infant years"- the cornucopia, another emblem of the never-empty breast, now a goat's. 34. It seems likely, then, that Keats thought the womb our first lost paradise. As soon as he called the urn a "foster-child," he may well have had the Immor- tality Ode in mind (as Lionel Trilling understands it; see The Liberal Imagination [New York: Viking, 1950], 147). The contribution this would make to the evolu- tionism in the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" may be inferred from the relationship Keats elsewhere implies between actual "happy boughs" and the human fetus. Keats presents the Cave of Quietude (JE, IV. 512-51) as the source of perfect sleep, and he describes it as a kind of womb: what else, in his cryptic account of the cave, led him to speak of Semeie pregnant with Bacchus and to exclaim about this "Dark paradise," "O wondrous soul! Pregnant with such a den" (11. 536-38, 544)? And Keats identifies this womblike perfect sleep with vegetation: in "The Eve of St. Agnes," Madeline, in a deep sleep, is "Blissfully haven'd both from joy and pain" "As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again" (11. 240, 243)- a regression identifying the "embalmed darkness" the covert in the Night- ingale Ode offers to return us to. This association of vegetation and womb in- cludes, naturally, the root- the umbilical cord that ties us to the heaven we share with "happy boughs" (The earth is my mother; I shall not want), before division into me and it. Keats- in the light of his medical studies and his reading of Dar- win and Greek mythology- may have accordingly seen the umbilical cord as a vestige of mammalian descent from the vegetable world. Lucretius says of the origin of man that "wombs grew up, holding to the earth by roots" and when "these were opened . . . Nature turned towards the newly born the pores of the earth, compelling it to open its veins and pour out liquid similar to milk" (On Nature, trans. Rüssel M. Geer [Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965], 184). May not Keats have had such a passage in mind when he asserted, "Agriculture is the tamer of men, the steam from the earth is like drinking their mother's milk- It enervates their natures" (2:156)? Suggestive too are the legend of Dryope (E, 1.495), who, Ovid tells us, was turned into a tree while she was suckling her son, "infant buds" (1.923), "the first / Violet young nature nurst" ("Song of Four Fairies," 11. 41-42), the canceled "My root" (Allott, ed., Ε, Ι.896-97η), and the friend's pun Keats calls "a very good thing" (1:200).</page><page sequence="23">Evil in the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn" . 249 35. George R. Levine ("The Arrogance of Keats's Grecian Urn," Essays in Literature 10 [Spring 1983]: 39-44) argues that Keats's "speaking" urn reflects the ancient Greek convention of inscribing on pottery and paintings such phrases as "I greet you," a practice rooted in the legendary "power [of art] to animate the inanimate" (40). See also Spitzer, 220-21, and Ian Jack, Keats and the Mirror of Art (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967), 223. 36. The urn, says W. H. Auden (The Dyer's Hand and Other Essays [New York: Random House, 1962], 337), "does not depict warfare, the evil which makes the citadel necessary." 37. Allott, ed., Ε, III.706n. By a route very different from mine, Philip Fisher ("A Museum with One Work Inside: Keats and the Finality of Art," Keats-Shelley Journal 33 [1984]) also finds the town "an image of the world after the human world has ended" (92; and see 97-102). Fisher's logic is flawed at the start by his evasion of the fact that the first scene in the ode is the group orgy in stanza 1, not the single piper of stanza 2 (92), but he understands that the ode is about death. 38. Since Keats had set love "at the tip-top" of the "fellowship divine" that he called "the clear religion of heaven" {Ε, Ι.805, 778, 781), and he could say, as Tom was dying, "if I think of fame of poetry it seems a crime to me, and yet I must do so or suffer" (1:369), what but universal cataclysm can Keats be envisioning as he stands thinking "on the shore / Of the wide world . . . / Till love and fame to nothingness do sink"? The gloss for Keats's "think" here is "but to think is to be full of sorrow"; and "nothingness" is identified in "Sleep and Poetry" as the cosmic rebuff to "visions" of divine benevolence (11. 155-59). In 1816 in the sonnet "To My Brother George," "whoso hears" the ocean's "voice mysterious" "Must think on what will be, and what has been"; and no more than ten days before "When I have fears," Keats wrote of going "mad with glimpses at fu- turity!" (in "Lines on Seeing a Lock of Milton's Hair"). 39. In his folio Shakespeare, Keats underlined "poore Tom" {King Lear, 3.6.29- 30) and wrote "Sunday evening, Oct. 4, 1818" (Caroline F. E. Spurgeon, Keats's Shakespeare [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1928], 43). 40. See Joseph Addison, The Spectator 413, 24 June 1712, in The Spectator, ed. Donald F. Bond (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965), 3:546-47. Tilottama Rajan {Dark Interpreter: The Discourse of Romanticism [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1980], 123-24) applies the passage to "Lamia." 41. "But essence, love, God, or powers, whatever the appellation, the eternal invisible was to Keats a very real dynamic existence, which he felt the true poet must know and understand" (Thorpe, 189).</page></plain_text>
