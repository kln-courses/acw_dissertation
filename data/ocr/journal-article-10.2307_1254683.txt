<plain_text><page sequence="1">METHOD AND MINOTAUR. BY A. LANG. (Read at Meeting, March I6th, 191o.) WHOEVER, as a child, read Kingsley's The Heroes with delight, must have been thrilled strangely when he learned that Mr. Arthur Evans had found in Knossos the palace of King Minos, and even representations of his bull-headed, bull-hoofed, and bull-tailed man-monster, the Minotaur. That find was first made some ten years ago, and it was a not unnatural inference from the discovery that the people of ancient Crete, (whose race and language we know not), had a bull-headed god. It was also a natural inference that the lads and lasses in Athenian stories sent to encounter the Minotaur were, in fact, offered as human sacrifices to this being. But a great deal of doubt has been thrown on these theories by the later discovery that Cretan art rejoiced in many things as fantastic as the grotesque non-religious sculptures on the walls of mediaeval cathedrals. The Cretan seal-rings display many purely fanciful figures of goat-headed, ass-headed, lion-headed men, and of an eagle-headed woman. Archaeologists as a rule do not take these figures as representations of therio- morphic merging into anthropomorphic objects of worship. Mr. A. B. Cook and Mons. Reinach (in a recent article in Rev. de I'Hist. des Religions) are, I think, of that opinion, which certainly needs discussion. But the bull-headed figure appears to be the only one of these grotesques which is employed as a link in a certain long and labyrinthine</page><page sequence="2">Method and Minotaur. 133 series of scientific hypotheses. They begin with Zeus. It is proved that he was in Greek religion the god of the sky, of the air, of the earth, of what is under the earth, of the rain, of the sun, of the stars, of the oak-tree, and of any other tree that was present where oaks were scarce, say poplar, plane, palm, and so on. No doubt all these and many other provinces were claimed for Zeus in historic Greece, though in each department he had many divine under-studies. But we, if interested in the Minotaur, want to know what the religious professors in prehistoric Crete thought about Zeus, how they worshipped him, and with what rites. On this part of the subject our only light comes from works of Minoan art, with inferences from the rites of Greeks in Crete in historic times. A new theory, however, concerning the Minotaur goes on to argue that, in late Minoan Knossos, (not yet Greek), a highly- civilized, wealthy, peaceful, and monarchical city, with a royal palace of enormous extent and surprising magni- ficence, and with a population who lived in eligible villa residences with every modern sanitary requirement, religion took the following shape :-The king (or Minos) was a priestly king, and was believed to be the living embodimnent of Zeus,-in especial of the god as Lord of the Sun. He was obliged every nine years to fight, run, or take part in some other athletic contest. If defeated, (and the veteran could hardly expect, if he won at eighteen, to retain the prize at thirty-six), he was done to death, and the victor obtained the crown. "It may be conjectured ... that the ritual costume of Minos was a bull mask," says Mr. A. B. Cook, " and that this gave rise to the legend of the bull-headed Minotaur." 1 Now, according to the Athenian legend, (which educated Greeks of the fifth century B.C. proclaimed to be a mere 1 The Classical Review, vol. xvii., p. 4Io.

That in a highly-civilized community of white men, where the king had great wealth, drilled troops (Cretan art proves that fact), and a powerful navy, the monarch should submit to such conditions is prima facie not probable. That any king, anywhere, has ever been regarded as the embodiment of the Supreme Being and, as such, slain, is not proved, to my knowledge, in a single verifiable instance.3 It is therefore my purpose to examine the scientific theory of the Minotaur as held by Mr. Cook (Folk-Lore, vol. xv., and Classical Review, vol. xvii.), and to point out what I humbly conceive to be perilous errors in the method of the extremely erudite school of the New Mythology. But my task is most complicated. I have re-written this paper several times, to tell the truth, and am not sure that I can make the matter clear. If you want lucidity, go to a Frenchman, and, at last, I have followed the clue of Ariadne as constructed by the Rev. Father M. J. Lagrange.4 Our first question is,-what was the nature of religion in civilized, prehistoric Crete? For a reply we first examine the contents of the caves which were held sacred even in the time of Socrates and later, and one of which was in the time of Socrates regarded as the birthplace of the Cretan Zeus, whatever the name of the god may have been in prehistoric times. Remember that, in Greece itself, as Pausanias writes in the second century A.D.,-" It is difficult to count all the peoples who attest that Zeus was born and bred among them," and he gives several 2 Plato, Minos, 318d to 320d. 3 Cf. Magic and Religion, pp. 82-Io7. 4 La Crite Ancienne, Paris, 190o8.</page><page sequence="4">Method and Minotaur. 135 instances.5 As the belief was so common in so many parts of the Greek mainland, it is probable that, when Homer's Achaeans settled in Crete, they found it already present as to the local cave-birthplace of a god whom they styled Zeus. Now the contents of one Cretan cave of Zeus, in Mount Ida, show relics of comparatively late non-Minoan art and worship, with an inscription in Greek characters. The pottery is not Minoan, but in the geometric style of de- coration influenced by Assyrian art, through Phcenicia. This is an early Dorian style, shown in the excavations at Sparta. Dorians dwelt in Crete in the time of the Odyssey. The other cave, (where, according to the Platonic dialogue Minos, King Minos met Zeus and took his instructions), is that of Dicte, near Psychro and near the ruins of Lyttos. This cave and its legend were already known to Hesiod, say 700 B.C.6 The cave has been excavated by Mr. Hogarth.7 The contents prove what representations of worship in Minoan art do not prove, that animals, oxen, goats, and deer were sacrificed, perhaps to the Mother of the Gods, perhaps to her associate, whom the Greeks called Zeus, her child. The double axe, often a symbol of divine power, was present, in art and in bronze votive offerings; all this certainly in Minoan times before the coming of Homer's Achaeans. That any divine being is represented by a bull-headed man is doubtful. Gods in the art are usually anthro- pomorphic; by far the most prominent is female. The male gods with haloes have human faces. One monster, with an earless and hornless head, a forked tail, human feet, and an arm ending in a hoof, is seated on a low camp stool, and gods are often seated. Beside him is a man who, contrary to Minoan usage, is short-haired and 5Pausanias, bk. iv., c. 33; bk. viii., c. 8, 28, 36, 38. 6 Theogony, v. 477- 7 The Annual Report of the British School at Athens, vol. vi., pp. 96 et seq.</page><page sequence="5">136 AMeltod and Minotaur. bearded.8 This is the most plausible example of a divine indeterminate bestial-headed monster. He is dubious. It is certain that the bull was a favourite victim in Minoan religion, and that, as in the Egypt of the period, the boukranion or bull skull, with a rosette or double axe between the horns, is a common decorative motive in Cretan art, as also in the tombs of the Acropolis at Mycenae.9 The Elamites also, 3,000 years before our era, represented Minotaurs in their art, apparently in an attitude of adoration. These are probably the proto- types of the Cretan Minotaurs or bull-headed demons. The ox does not appear in any form in the more primitive archaeological strata of Crete.10 As regards the divine bull, or the bull-headed god, the Minotaur, (whose existence as a being divine and worshipped is quite problematic), we have little to add. As late as Euripides a tradition of strange and wild feasts on raw bull's flesh in Crete existed. These, in the fragmentary chorus from his fragmentary play, The Cretans, are contrasted with the pure and vegetarian life of the devotees of the Idaean Zeus. But Miss Harrison, in contradiction of several learned Germans, thinks that Idaean Zeus, the pure, is merely another aspect of Dionysus Zagreus, the impure, whose orgies involved " red and bleed- ing feasts " of raw bull's meat." Miss Harrison shows that Plutarch and the early Christian fathers speak with horror of wild savage rites, "eatings of raw flesh and rendings asunder," as being still extant; while there are traditions in very late sources of tearing a living man or child in s See Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, p. 483, Fig. 146. 9Cf.

Moreover, Clemens Alexandrinus says that the abomination, ac- cording to Antikleides, author of an epic on the Return of the Heroes from Troy, was practised by the Cretan Lyctii, apparently of Mount Lyttos, where is the cave of Dictaean Zeus.12 We have certainly a most unholy mixture of bulls and human sacrifices and Zeus reported from Crete. Is the Athenian legend of the victims of the Minotaur a refraction from actual facts of human sacrifice to a bovine god ? That is our problem. I may first remark that Mr. Evans, as he tells me, has found no hint of human sacrifice in prehistoric Cretan art, or in any other relics of that age and country. Secondly, in the transition from Euripides to Clemens Alexandrinus we do not get,-at least I do not get,-the impression that these savage survivals or re- crudescences were national, or were affairs of civic worship. Rather they seem to be the delight of secret societies of d/cadents like de Sade and Gilles de Rais. If so, worse things than they did may have been attributed to them. Compare pagan charges against the early Christians, medi- aeval charges against the Jews, and the allegations against witches even later. The public worship of highly-civilized Minoan Crete, as far as Cretan art shows, consisted of prayer and offerings of fruit, flowers, and libations. The only sacrifice of animals is represented on a painted larnax or coffin from Hagia Triada, and the recipient seems to be the ghost of a dead hero.13 Father Lagrange himself thinks that the god had the main part of the sacrifice, but the hero seems to be accepting a calabash of ox's blood. There is no hint of fire and sacrifice. Here it may be well to say that there is very little evidence for human sacrifice in prehistoric Hellas, while, as for the pharmakos of historic Hellas, the wretch may 12 See authorities in Harrison, op. cit., pp. 484-6. 13 Lagrange, op. cit., pp. 60-7.</page><page sequence="7">138 Method and Minotaur. or may not have been put to death, probably not, in historic Greece: but that he was no sacrifice to a god, and merely a human scapegoat bearing the pollutions of the city on his head, Miss Harrison and Mr. Murray seem to have proved.4 Miss Harrison thinks that the two human scapegoats were criminals already condemned, and that they were done to death. Certainly a writer of 230 B.C., with another rather silly gossip of I150 A.D. (Tzetzes), and a scholiast on Aristophanes, leave the impression that the men were killed, to prevent them from returning. But scapemen are one thing, and altars of the Olympians stained with human blood are another. As to pre-Homeric times, Miss Harrison says, (p. Io9), -" It may indeed be doubted whether we have any certain evidence of 'human sacrifice' . . . among the Greeks even of mythological days." Iphigenia and Polyxena, she thinks, were slain, (of course not in Homer), to placate a ghost. Polyxena, in the Ionian epics of 750 to 600 B.C., was slain over the grave of Achilles, but the same poets tell us that Achilles was not buried in Troyland, he was carried by Thetis to the Isle of Leuk6 in the Euxine, where he was worshipped, and, says Pausanias, married happily, his wife being Helen of Troy! The post-Homeric legends, whether in Ionian epics, historians, the tragic poets, or scraps preserved by anti- quaries down to I150 A.D., are all at odds, and only prove that such or such a writer or chapel-sacristan thought such or such a sacrifice feasible in prehistoric times. As a matter of method, all such evidence is suspicious, and we ought to use it with the utmost critical care; especially we must not select scraps which suit our theory and ignore others which contradict it. When the Achaean traditions in Homer backed by Hesiod take one view of a legendary personage, such as Minos, while the Attic traditions, really ' Harrison, op. cit., pp. 95-110; Murray, The Rise of the Greek Epic, pp. 253-258.</page><page sequence="8">Method and Minotaur. 139 hostile to the Achaeans, take the opposite view, we must not ignore Homer and Hesiod and treat the figments of Attic poets as in a way historical. Now, to return to the Minotaur, we must steadily remember that the whole story about him and his victims is an Attic, a non-Achaean, legend. Socrates, in the Minos, justly says that it was an invention of Attic poets, made because they were on ill terms with Minos, whom Homer applauds, with Hesiod's consent, above any other mortal man. Next, we must remember that the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, and all the pseudo- historic legends of the Greek states, (except probably as to migrations of peoples), are merely the "saga" forms of mdrchen of world-wide diffusion and of dateless anti- quity. The story which a Greek tells of Theseus or CEdipous, of Pelops or Minos, of Orpheus or Zagreus, of Hesione or Andromeda, is only a mdrchen or folk-tale, equipped with names of legendary heroes and heroines, and of known places. The Bechuana, the Samoans, the Samoyeds, the Santals, even the Arunta, the Huarocihiri, the Maoris, not to mention the folk-tales of Europe, repeat the same stories and story-incidents about unnamed persons in No-man's-land. It appears to me that some of our most erudite mythologists have not these facts present to their minds in each case. Therefore, when they find in the pseudo-historic legend and in poetry traces of a custom, say the bride-race, or royalty acquired by success in running or boxing, or by solving a riddle, or bringing some rare object through many perils, or slaying a monster like the Minotaur; or find exogamy, indicated by the crown going to an alien adventurer who wins the heiress by answering her riddle, or defeating her in a race, or making her laugh, or who runs away with her after she has magically enabled him to achieve some perilous adventure, (Theseus and Ariadne, and Medea and Jason); mythologists leap to the conclusion</page><page sequence="9">140o ethod and Minotaur. that one of these methods, the contest for the crown in a race or a fight, was the recognised and customary way of settling the succession to the throne in ancient Greece. Meanwhile all these incidents are mdrchenhaft; they are romantic stock situations; if such modes of acquir- ing royalty were once universally customary, it must have been in the world of early human fancies, not of facts. Before we can infer that even one of these many incidents was ever matter of custom so widely diffused that it has coloured the marchen of the world, and the shape that they take in Greek saga, we must discover many examples of the custom with valid historical record, observed and described by competent witnesses. For one incident, the bride-race, or the race for the crown, Mr. Frazer cites the Alitemnian Libyans,15 while the Svayamvara, where the maiden chose one of her crowd of suitors or was offered as the prize in a trial of skill, " was occasionally observed among the Rajputs down to a late time." Several German and one English treatise on Hindu Law are cited in support.16 Of course sporting Rajputs may have imitated what they knew from mdrchen or from sagas (the Mahabhdrata). Or the Rajputs may really, like the Alitemnian Libyans, have had the usage of giving the crown, or the bride, to the swiftest or most dexterous competitor. But examples of this one usage, historically observed in the ancient world, have only the authority of Nicolaus Damascenus, in one instance, so far as I am aware. Surely that is not enough to prove that all the body of such eccentric customs in the mdrchen of the world are survivals of universal usages. The usage, necessary to Mr. Cook's Minotaur theory, of slaying unsuccessful competitors, is, as far as I know, without 15 Nicolaus Damascenus in Stobaeus, Florilegium, xliv. 41 ; Frazer, Lectures on the Early History of the Kingship, p. 260. I" Frazer, op. cit., p. 262, note 2.</page><page sequence="10">Method and Minotaur. 14 I example in practice. Nor can we infer, with Mr. Cook, that in highly-civilized Knossos, with its wealth, its palaces, its bijou villa residences, and its pretty Parisiennes in every variety of medieval and modern costume, the King or the Crown Prince, wearing a bull's mask, had at stated intervals to fight or run for his life and his royal rights, and was, in fact, the Minotaur defeated by Theseus! This is the theory of the Minotaur advanced by Mr. Cook in his " Zeus, Jupiter, and The Oak," in vol. xvii. of The Classical Review, and, with variations, in his "The European Sky God" in Folk-Lore, vol. xv. Now for the story of conflicts with the Minotaur we have no evidence, I repeat, beyond the Athenian adaptation of the mdrchen of the Lad, the Giant (or Elephant), and the Giant's Daughter to the names of Theseus, Minos, and Ariadne. To this I shall return; but, meanwhile, the Greek (chiefly Attic and Ionian) legends of sacrificed princesses appear in Attic mdrchen so primitive that a large percentage of the characters become birds, as in Australian, or American-Indian, or South American folk- tales. One form of such sacrifice is exposure of the royal maiden to a monster, (Andromeda and Hesione). That is pure mdrchen, and is no proof of such a custom in pre- historic Greece or at Troy. The mdrchen is carried on into pseudo-historic legend. The other human sacrifices are done in obedience to the command of an oracle, so that some curse on the country may be removed. But in the famous Minyan case of Phrixus, Helle, and the Ram,17 (whether his fleece was golden or purple, or merely white), in my earliest excursion into these fieldsis I showed that the Phrixus story is the saga form of the world-wide folk-tale of children with a ram, lamb, or other friendly animal, fleeing, not from sacrifice, but from cannibalism. The modern Epirote 17 See Phrixus in Roscher's Lexikon. 18" " Mythology and Fairy Tales," Fortnightly Review, May, 1873.</page><page sequence="11">142 Method and Minotaur. variant Asterinos and Pulfa is in Von Hahn19; the Samoyed, with beaver for ram, in Castrin.20 The Greeks merely adapted the mdrchen to certain names,-(Helle is simply, as Seeliger says, in Roscher's Lexikon, the eponymous heroine of the Hellespont),-and to certain places, which were localised variously as geogra- phical knowledge widened. For cannibalism the Greeks substituted human sacrifice in some great need of the State. It is in Attic myth that the story is constantly repeated, like a formula of mdrchen. I cannot deny that the idea was much present to the ancient story-tellers who converted mdrchen into saga or pseudo-history; but I agree with Miss Harrison, as already quoted, that " it may be doubted whether we have any certain evidence of 'human sacrifice' among the Greeks even of mytho- logical days." Again, it was customary for classical antiquaries to explain various rites as offerings of "surrogates," or sacrifices for human victims. One case of such an aetiological myth is notorious. We know the oscilla, masks of human faces, which in parts of Italy were suspended on fruit trees and vines.21 The old antiquaries of Rome explained these masks as substitutes for heads of human victims, which the Dodona oracle bade the Pelasgians offer to Saturn (Kronos). For the story of an oracle older than Heracles' time they quoted L. Manilius, who saw the oracle inscribed on a tripod. It contains Latin words, "the Saturnian laws," "the aborigines," and is a clumsy forgery. Meanwhile, Mr. Stephen Ponder points out to me that Maori chiefs of old hung their own portrait masks (rahui), with their own well-known tattooing, in each case, about 19 Griechische und Albanische Marchen. 20 Ethnologische Vorlesungen iiber die altaischen Vilker etc. 21Virgil, Georgics, ii. 389, and see examples in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, s.v. Oscilla.</page><page sequence="12">Melthod and Minotaur. 143 their own grounds as a mark of ownership,-and of tabooed soil, I presume. "Trespassers, beware!" that was the meaning. Miss Harrison also22 quotes savage masks whose function is permanently "to make an ugly face" at you if you are robbing a neighbour or his orchard. Miss Harrison is not discussing oscilla, but I think that she and Mr. Ponder have hit on a more probable explanation of oscilla than that which Mr. Cook shares with L. Manilius and other Roman antiquaries. Mr. Cook holds, with them, that the masks are evidence of human sacrifice in the past.23 The forged oracle in Pelasgian Greek and Latin, more ancient than Heracles, was also used to explain the Argei, or straw puppets, thrown over the Sublician bridge at Rome. They were originally men offered, on the demand of the same forged oracle, to Saturn. In the case of the puppets, the presence of the wife of the Flamen Dialis, mourning, may indicate that the Latins once drowned men, as the Trojans drowned horses, to propitiate their river. Now I hope that I have made my position, the shadowy nature of mythological evidence for Greek human sacrifices to gods, clear enough to procure suspended judgment, or even a verdict of " not proven." Returning to Minoan Crete, we have had no proof of human sacrifices in that isle in prehistoric times. But that topic, with the whole theory that the Minotaur was the king, or prince, of Knossos embodying the god of the sun, the sky, the stars, and the oak tree, and that, masked as a bull, he, or his son, fought every nine years for his rights and his life (Mr. Cook's view), or was butchered in a cave, while another man came out in the same mask (Mr. Murray's view), cannot be dealt with in our space. Meanwhile, let the reader ask himself, "Was the arrangement likely to be submitted to by the wealthy and powerful monarch of a highly-civilized state, in touch 22Op. cit., p. 138. 23 The Classical Review, vol. xvii., pp. 269-70.</page><page sequence="13">I44 Method and Minotaur. with the Egypt of the sixteenth century B.C.?" The solitary historical example of kings who, at the end of twelve years, had to commit suicide, is that of Calicut, but there the king (a vassal or subject prince) adopted measures which secured his safety before 1683.24 Not a hint of any such measures occurs in Greek tradition. I have not read that this king of Calicut was looked on as an embodiment of such a deity as the Zeus of the Greeks. Again, in the Attic fable, Theseus, after slaying the Minotaur, does not succeed to the rights of the Crown Prince in Knossos. He simply sails away. Finally, the whole theory that the Minotaur has to do battle for his life and rights at stated periods, rests solely on one line of the Odyssey, in which, whatever Homer means to say, he certainly says not a word about any such contest. The line is Odyssey, xix. 179; it runs, being interpreted, "Cnossos, and there Minos reigned evvc'Wpog, he who spake face to face with (or was the comrade of) great Zeus." The meaning of the word evvcwpog in this passage is unknown. If we translate it "Minos ruled in periods of nine years," or "Minos conversed with Zeus every nine years," we get a recurrent period. Mr. Cook holds that at these periods the son of Minos fought for his crown. Mr. Murray holds that Minos himself, wearing a bull's mask or protom', was butchered in the Dictaean cave. If you consult Mr. Monro's edition of the Odyssey, you will find that he knows not how to interpret the passage. You will get no more satisfaction from another great scholar, A. Ludwig, in his essay on Minos (Prague, 1903). Ludwig equates Minos with the German Mannus, and thinks him a purely mythical being. In short, as Professor Burrows, Dr. Hawes, and other scholars see, the possible historic fact in the Attic myth 24 Frazer, Lectures on the Early History of the Kingship, pp. 293-296.</page><page sequence="14">Method and Minotazr. 145 of Theseus and the Minotaur is the sending of Attic captives into the Cretan bull-ring (taurokathapsia), where boy and girl acrobats, on foot, played perilous tricks with bulls, as often depicted in Cretan art. The rest of the myth is a common mairchen localised. I have tried to keep the discussion within the limits of Folk-Lore and of historic fact, and am dealing elsewhere with other elements in Mr. Cook's system. For example, the late Cretan explanation that Athens had to provide young people, in revenge for the death of Androgeos, as prizes at periodical games at Knossos, cannot be earlier than the non-Homeric institution of games at fixed periods. No evidence, I think, is produced (as in the case of Dodona) for such games at Knossos. Again, the passage cited from Diodorus, in proof that Kings of Egypt did wear bestial masks, is a mere etiological myth to explain the Odyssean story of Proteus. He, said the Egyptian priests, was a King of Egypt, and such kings wore trees and fire on their heads, as well as bestial masks. This is absurd: they only wore the golden urwus-snake of Royalty. The Attic Theseus story is but a world-wide mdrchen, coloured, probably by a memory of the sports in the bull-ring, (at which captives may have been the per- formers), and perhaps by representations in art of men with bovine heads. From such figures it is a far cry to inferences about the king as an embodiment of an universal god, and as fighting, in person, or in the person of his son, for his life and crown. A far cry, too, it is to the sacred wedding of the Queen with a Bull-god. If such a rite in any place occurred, it was at Athens. The Athenians would understand that the affair was mystic and symbolic, not abominable. But it is the Athenians, not the Achaean poet, Homer, who degrade the whole kith and kin of Minos by the most disgusting inventions, including the birth of the Minotaur. These tales, inter K</page><page sequence="15">146 Method and Minotaur. Christianos non nominanda, may be read in the articles on "Minos" and "Minotaur" in Roscher's Lexikon. The article on Homer's stainless Achilles illustrates even more powerfully the horrors with which historic Greece defiled the memories of the heroes of the conquering Achaeans; against whom the later Greeks, descendants, mainly, of a conquered population, entertained an undying grudge. It survives in the Troilus and Cressida of Shakespeare. A. LANG.</page></plain_text>
