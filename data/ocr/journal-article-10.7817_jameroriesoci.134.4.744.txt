Schildt also succeeds at illustrating in detail the various ways in which the houses appear to agree  with the instructions of the Sanskrit manuals (pp. 89–92, 163–65) and the dimensions of traditional  South Asian geomancy (pp. 165–73). He stops short, however, of exploring the significance of these  agreements, either by contextualizing them against areas of disagreement or by examining what they  might say, for example, about the relationship between śāstra (technical manuals) and practice in the  history of Kerala architecture more generally. In general, the text would have benefited from the more explicit articulation of a unifying problem- atic. Chapters and sections frequently begin with no introduction and end with no conclusion. In these  cases the reader is not told how the author sees the various parts of the text relating to the whole, to the  detriment of the study generally. Schildt, moreover, identifies many agreements between field data from  the houses and various, heterogeneous textual sources (e.g., the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, the Gṛhyasūtras,  medieval architecture texts, early-twentieth-century gazetteers, and contemporary anthropology), but  there is little in the way of critical engagement with the sources that might help draw out the rela- tive significance of the agreements or disagreements documented by the author. As such, documented  points of contact remain ambiguous with regard to the historical relationship between textual sources  and practice. Following the text itself are three appendices. The first gives excerpts from Sanskrit architectural  texts without translation, mainly the VV and MC. The second appendix has three glossaries: of names,  of ritual terms, and of architectural terms. All of these include both Sanskrit and Māḷayalam vocabu- lary, and the last is of particular value, making reference to the VV and MC as well as the figures,  tables, and plates of the text. The third appendix is a series of tables, the first five of which collate infor- mation on ritual diagrams from the Sanskrit texts and the remaining thirty of which collate data on the  catuḥśālas themselves. Greater editorial care would have helped the book, as errors are not infrequent  and the writing is sometimes obscure, particularly as the content becomes more abstract and complex. In all, Schildt’s work is a scholarly achievement that will exert great influence for a long time to  come. The text fruitfully analyzes much of the primary and secondary textual material bearing on  our understanding of the catuḥśāla and presents invaluable data from the author’s fieldwork. It is  highly recommended to all who have an interest in traditional South Asian architecture, geomancy, and  domestic ritual and provides much useful data to those interested in the relationship between śāstra  and practice. Mark McClish Birmingham-Southern College Brains, Buddhas, and Believing: The Problem of Intentionality in Classical Buddhist and Cognitive- Scientific Philosophy of Mind. By dan aRnold. New York: columBia univERSity pRESS, 2012.  Pp. xiv+ 311. $50. Arnold’s book constructs a dialogue between fourth to eleventh century Indian intellectuals and  recent as well as contemporary philosophers in Western traditions, aiming to show that many thoughts  found in old Indian philosophy can be read in a way that makes them relevant to modern discussions.  The book’s central question is—can intentionality be reduced to a cause-effect relation or is it an  </page> <page sequence="2"> Reviews of Books 745 irreducible mark of mental events? This question is discussed from three perspectives: two cognitivist  ones, which both take intentionality to be reducible to a causal description but are divided over their  idea of causality into physicalists and antiphysicalists, and a transcendental one, which says inten- tionality is irreducible and the defining mark of mental events. Arnold makes many voices heard in  this dialogue: loudest for the first position is Jerry Fodor’s, followed by Dennet’s. Arguments for the  second position are inspired by Arnold’s reading of Dharmakīrti, the seventh-century Indian Buddhist  widely recognized and studied as a major force in Indian logic and epistemology. For his own argu- ments towards intentionality’s irreducibility, Arnold makes use of a broad range of thinkers: Kumārila,  Candrakīrti, Hume, Kant, Brentano, Sellars, and McDowell, to name just the most prominent ones. Dharmakīrti is at the center of three out of the book’s six parts. First, Dharmakīrti’s proof of rebirth  is considered. This results in the mentioned subdivision of the cognitivist project: Arnold points out  that Dharmakīrti’s and Fodor’s concepts of a mental event’s causal properties differ significantly, since  Dharmakīrti insists that these events happen within a causal chain that is independent of a physical  body. Fodor’s cognitivism is at the center of the second part. Quoting widely from Fodor’s work of  over thirty years, Arnold discusses mainly two elements in Fodor’s thought: the separation of a mental  event’s content and its causal characteristics (which belong to the mental event only insofar as it is a  neurophysical event) on the one hand, and, on the other, a methodological solipsism that Fodor has to  countenance if he admits, as he did especially in his later work, that content features among the causally  relevant properties of a mental event. Part three contains the main arguments which Arnold makes against cognitivism; these are based  on Kant’s transcendental unity of apperception, spontaneity, and the role of practical reason, mostly as  interpreted through Sellars and McDowell. The main consequence Arnold draws from the argument  about transcendental unity is that “the content of experience must be logically of the same kind as what  we adduce to justify beliefs or actions” (p. 89), that is, be ultimately propositional. The requirement of  being able to give reasons (in Sellars’ sense) for such a proposition Arnold finds in spontaneity. This  allows him to conclude that “an exhaustively impersonal account of the mental is finally unintelligible”  (p. 113). Hence, intentionality is not reducible to cause-effect relations. In the next two parts Dharmakīrti again moves to the center of attention. In part four Arnold presents  Dharmakīrti’s theory about the objects of words and concepts as an ultimately causal account of a men- tal (here conceptual) event’s content, in contrast to Dharmakīrti’s most influential predecessor, Dignāga  (sixth century c.E.). One problem discussed is that, since for Dharmakīrti only particulars are capable  of being causes, a causal account of concepts cannot work: neither particular objects like individual  trees, nor their representations in awareness, which also must be particulars if they are to cause a con- ceptual cognition, can account for the content of the general concept “tree.” His main challenge against  Dharmakīrti in respect to concepts is, however, that both language acquisition by an individual and the  invention of language as such cannot be adequately explained. These “occasions on which the funda- mental connection of language with non-linguistic fact is exhibited” (in the words of Sellars quoted on  p. 123) are, so Arnold, essential to any account that wishes to explain mental content in purely causal  terms. Failure on this count is a failure of the whole theory to explain intentionality. Arnold interprets  Dharmakīrti as hopelessly mangling the distinction of learning language and learning a word. Dharmakīrti’s doctrine of svasaṃvitti, translated as “self-awareness,” is the subject of the fifth part.  This is the chapter with the most complex argument, in my opinion, and I limit myself here to a simple  report of Arnold’s conclusions, which are arrived at through a detailed examination of Dignāga’s theory  of mental perception and Dharmakīrti’s argument that cognition accompanies every appearance and is,  in that sense, basic. For Dharmakīrti, self-awareness has as its direct object only itself, in the form of  a representation of something else. On Arnold’s analysis, the content, or what is represented, has no  role to play in the causal continuum that is essentially reducible to representations and the awareness  of them. This, so Arnold, is problematic for Dharmakīrti: if cognition and the particular representations  appearing in it are basic, then they have to, but cannot, constitute higher-level acts of awareness, such  as those with propositional content. This position is also open to the same concerns that Arnold has  about Fodor’s methodological solipsism, namely that this reduction to what appears directly does not  necessarily make an explanation in causal terms easier. </page> <page sequence="3"> 746 Journal of the American Oriental Society 134.4 (2014) In the book’s last part, Arnold presents criticisms of Dharmakīrti by two ancient Indian traditions,  Mīmāṃsā and Madhyamaka à la Candrakīrti, as closely tracking his own criticism of cognitivism. Throughout the book, Arnold has to balance many different elements against each other: first he  reconstructs an ancient Indian exchange surviving in often cryptic Sanskrit; second he presents and  enriches more accessible but very detailed and technical discussions of intentionality and physicalist  cognitivism; finally he intertwines these strands to show that arguments made on wholly different back- grounds do actually resonate with each other. Readers acquainted with Fodor’s work will probably find  Arnold’s a rich and inspiring summary, livened up by many succinct assessments of related positions.  Readers like me, however, who are not so well versed in that material, will probably find themselves  rereading some sections in order to grasp the essential points amongst the many made. Arnold’s dis- cussion of Sellars and McDowell on intentionality is also not an easy introduction, but does provide  a concise account of the main points, as well as many references to the reception and refinement of  their theories. An element I really missed, though, was a discussion of Sellars’ theory about changing  categories. I would have thought this worth investigating especially since it does not simply pitch two  world views against each other but provides a rich theoretical framework for a gradual merging of  perspectives that might have been useful for Arnold’s project. The Indian side of the discussion I have stronger opinions about. Certainly Arnold’s way of read- ing these old texts is highly original. His remarkable creativity lies in juxtaposing a paragraph from  the seventh and one from the twentieth century, and showing that they do, in fact, talk about the same  thing. This approach allows him to see that Fodor’s project has a lot in common with Dharmakīrti’s  arguments on mental content, though one is a physicalist and the other not. By extension, the critics  of Fodor and Dharmakīrti on these points are shown to share many intuitions. This nicely embeds the  discussions in an overall perspective that allows novel interpretations, such as reading a traditional  criticism of Dharmakīrti’s apoha theory (that particulars cannot cause a general concept) as relevant to  a modern argument about reductionism. But at times I think this same approach carries Arnold a bit too far. One point in this respect would  be his discussion of saṃketa, the convention which, according to Dharmakīrti, allows people to agree  on words for things. Arnold places great emphasis on Dharmakīrti’s failure to distinguish learning a  word from learning a language (akin to Wittgenstein’s criticism of the Augustinian model in the Philo- sophical Investigations). But he does not try to show that this is what Dharmakīrti actually wants this  “convention” to do. Dharmakīrti can more simply be understood as saying that humans (or, generally,  mind continua) are by nature conceptualizing entities. There is no acquisition of a previously missing  capacity for conceptual activity; it is simply there. So “convention” is always the learning of a new  word within an already existing language, and relies heavily on the ability of the learner to conceptual- ize “by herself” what a word is referring to and on that learner already having understood what it is to  mean something. It is not part of a discussion about the possibility of conceptuality as such. Keeping in mind that some interpretations might be going a bit too far, I can recommend Arnold’s  book to a general audience as a challenging read that makes several hundred years of thinking about  intentionality come alive with references to many of the important disputants.
