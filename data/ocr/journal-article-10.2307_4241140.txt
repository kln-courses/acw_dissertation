<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 49 Anindita Banerjee Electricity: Science Fiction and Modernity in Early Twentieth- Century Russia In November 1920, Vladimir Il'ich Lenin issued a slogan identifying electricity as the only remaining step in Russia's path to Communism: "Communism is equal to Soviet power plus the electrification of the entire country" ("Kommunizm est' sovetsksaia vlast' plius elektrifikatsiia vsei strany"). The declaration signified the Communist Party's approval of a plan forwarded by GOELRO, "The State Commission for the Electrification of Russia" (Gosudarstvennaia komissiia elektrifikatsii Rossii). Lenin's statement, which until recently adorned the central power station in Moscow, remains in collective memory as the moment when electrification was officially named the state technology and primary instrument for modernizing the country. The proposition seems daring: compared to the West, mass electrification in Russia at the time could only be called a pipe dream. By the first decade of the twentieth century, industrialized societies such as Germany and the United States were experiencing electricity not only as a mundane household technology but also as a massive force for social change. Commercial promotion and cheap mass distribution of inventions such as Edison's light bulb and the Siemens Company's dynamos had radically transformed everyday life both in big cities and provincial towns (see Rose), and new labor-saving devices reduced the work week from eighty to forty hours (see Nye). Lenin's belief that a utopian state must necessarily be "electrified," in fact, stemmed from personal experience of its transformative effects in Western Europe: traveling through Germany in 1908, he noted that electrical technology would evolve into "the strongest instrument of capitalist economy" in the age to come (233). While electricity rapidly evolved into the chief index of progress and prosperity in the West, revolution and civil war only served to slow down the tentative and uneven course towards technologization that had begun in Russia at the turn of the twentieth century. A report of the Bolshevik government shows that, as late as 1919, the number of electric stations in Soviet Russia and the United States were 220 and 5221 respectively; consumption of electricity in kilowatt-hour per capita was 16 and 500 (Dreier 8). Even biased retrospective assessments of technological progress, such as might be found in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia compiled during Stalin's time, admit that until the late 1920s Russia remained "positively backward" in the production and consumption of electricity (Vvedenskii 445). In his monograph on the history of electrification in Russia, Jonathan Coopersmith confirms that even after World War I compelled the Tsarist government to recognize the importance of electrical technology for the first time, efforts to promote and distribute it remained "extremely slow"; after 1917, "electricity production dropped sharply and did not regain pre-Revolutionary levels until the mid 1920s" (121).</page><page sequence="2">50 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) Assessing Lenin's call for electrification against the infrastructures available for actuating a technological utopia, Richard Stites comments that the Bolshevik leader's "visionary speculation" was equally a "desperate measure designed to make the economy work and the Soviet regime survive" (46). In a context where most of the population had no direct access to electric power and little experience of its beneficial effects, Lenin's slogan displays a remarkable way of bridging the disjuncture between utopian vision and material reality. While couched in the seemingly infallible language of a mathematical proposition ("is equal to," "plus"), it attributes potentials of metaphysical rather than material change to technology. Electrification is transformed from commodity to metaphor when, rather than indicating how it will improve material conditions, the slogan represents it as an extension of abstract political authority (Soviet power) and a catalyst for epistemological change (Com- munism). Such a reversal of reification may seem a typical, and therefore insignificant, component of "propaganda" that "history" or "facts" eventually normnalize. But immediate responses to Lenin's call in visual arts and literature demonstrate that the conception of electricity as a metaphysical force resonated at least as profoundly as the mechanical potentials of electrification. Posters issued in 1921, while representing Lenin poised in front of gigantic futuristic power stations adorned with declarations such as "Soviets and Electrification will create a New World," just as often focus on electricity as an abstract vitalist force. The renowned artist Ivan Puni depicts the New Soviet Man as a creature animated by electricity. Unlike Frankenstein's monster, this figure is an anatomically and ideationally perfect Prometheus with wires extending upwards from his body, transfiguring it into a cosmic bridge between heaven and earth; the painting transforms the symbolism of Christian iconography by replacing the traditional halo around a holy man's head with a shower of electric sparks. An anonymous poster from the early 1920s titled "Electrification and Counterrevolution" literalizes Lenin's formulation of electricity as ideological power: it shows a personified representative of capitalism and monarchism deterred by a disembodied electric bulb. Andrei Platonov, an electrical engineer who initially hailed the inception of GOELRO and participated in the plan through the 1920s, underscores how the metaphysical aspect of Lenin's 'slogan superceded and even undermined the material promises implied in it. In a science-fiction story written in 1926, "The Homeland of Electricity" ("Rodina Elektrichestva"), Platonov hyperbolizes the rupture between utopian rhetoric and actual conditions for rapid technolo- gization. The peasant protagonists of the story interpret the Bolshevik leader's pronouncement as a magic incantation rather than as a policy statement. "Now life will be mighty and beautiful, and there will be eggs for everyone" ("Teper' zhizn' budet moguchei i prekrasnoi, i khvatit vsem kurinogo iaitsa"), the village head asserts, paraphrasing the promises made to the downtrodden in the Hymn to the Third International: "Now life will be mighty and beautiful, and there will be bread for everyone" ("Teper' zhizn' budet moguchei i prekrasnoi, i khvatit vsem khleba"). Folk mysticism, rather than revolutionary zeal or technological</page><page sequence="3">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 51 knowledge, lies at the basis of this eccentric association of electrification and eggs. Equipped only with a broken dynamo and no fuel, famine-ravaged peasants fail to understand that electrification is meant to revolutionize agriculture. Instead, they regard the non-functioning generator as a repository of life in its most cosmic manifestation. Eggs represent the fountainhead of creation in Slavic folk belief, in which the world is said to have originated from a "cosmic egg" ("mirovoe iatso") in pre-Christian mythology; the symbol later evolved into the colorful eggs of Resurrection shared at Easter celebrations (Afanas'ev 2, 227). In the absence of knowledge about and infrastructure for electrification, the peasants in Platonov's story literally envision electricity as the primeval essence of creation and salvation. The bivalent semantic content of electricity was not a product of Bolshevik utopianism alone. Its perception as a combined source of material and metaphysical energy had been codified, disseminated, and perpetuated in the cultural imagination well before the October Revolution through a literary genre not often associated with policy statements and political ideology. Science fiction provided the first discursive site in which the two projected applications of electricity were unified in a single utopian paradigm. In particular, science fiction of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries-after Edison's invention of the electric bulb became an international media event, even in Russia-prefigured the distinctive modes in which Bolshevik rhetoric later identified electrification as the most potent instrument of modernity. Science fiction imagery, therefore, provides a particularly productive medium for examining continuities between pre- and post-Revolutionary constructs of technological utopia. This essay investigates such continuities through the examination of the unique role that science fiction came to play in Russia prior to 1920. Like Lenin's slogan, science fiction defined the relevance of a technology that was neither domesticated nor demystified, and in ways that resonated with the particular anxieties and needs of the Russian context. My essay also delineates the processes through which science fiction synthesized, interacted with, and contributed to representations of electricity in apparently discrete spheres of cultural discourse: canonical and popular literature, mass media, advertisements, dictionaries and encyclopedias, popular philosophy, and aesthetic theory. Through an investigation of intertextual relationships both within the genre and with the discursive spheres listed above, I explain why pre-Revolutionary science-fictional constructs of electricity prepared the rhetorical and cultural ground for Bolshevik utopianism about electrification. The two opposing perceptions of electricity conflated in Lenin's slogan had existed for a considerable time in Russian cultural discourse, but only as components of mutually exclusive epistemologies: rationality versus intuition. Just as Lenin became the icon of the national electrification drive in Soviet Russia, in the eighteenth century the figure of Mikhail Lomonosov, "the Russian Father of Science," was inalienably bound to a rational perception of electricity as a tractable natural phenomenon. In an age when electricity was widely perceived as an elemental, irrational force, Lomonosov, who experimented with</page><page sequence="4">52 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) capturing lightning just as Benjamin Franklin did, published several seminal essays between 1745 and 1756 explaining it in terms of the physical sciences. Convinced that one day it would prove to be of great use to humnkind, he used electricity as the chief metaphor in a famous plea for the development of scientific and technological education in Russia. This treatise in poetic form, titled "On the Use of Glass" ("Pis'mo o pol'ze stekla" 1752), compares the act of harnessing atmospheric electricity to Prometheus's bringing the gift of fire to mankind (245). Russian admirers of Enlightenment thought subsequently eulogized the scientist through the same metaphor by depicting him as the "electrical" modern-day Prometheus. Echoing d'Alembert's characterization of Franklin that "he tore lightning from the heavens and the scepter from the tyrants" (quoted by Friedell 183), Alexander Radishchev, one such thinker, wrote in 1790 that "Lomonosov could produce flashes of lightning and repel lashes of thunder" ("Lomonosov umel proizvodit' elektricheskuiu silu, umel otvrashchat' udary groma" 203). Though Lomonosov continued to be venerated in academic circles, a diametrically opposite view of electricity emerged early in the nineteenth century. The pendulum swing owed much to the avid interest with which the Russian elite followed trends of life and thought in Western Europe. In 1780, both the scientific community and the demimonde in France and Germany became obsessed with Luigi Galvani's discovery that two pieces of dissimilar metals could make a dead frog twitch even in the absence of a source for electricity. Galvani's claim that electricity was of "biological" rather than inorganic origins rapidly acquired a life of its own. Within a year of his discovery, the physician Franz Anton Mesmer advanced the theory that a unified electric field conjoined the external world to the innermost elusive realms of the human psyche (12). Not only did Mesmer's observations give rise to an independent medical field in which doctors attempted to manipulate the mind by subjecting the head to electric currents-the practice survives to this day in the form of shock therapy in mental institutions-but also generated a plethora of parapsychological and occult understandings of electricity (see, for example, Chardel, Dupau, Ennemoser). Encyclopedias, government bulletins, and newspaper articles from early nineteenth-century Russia show that Galvani's and Mesmer's popularity had irrevocably transformed perceptions of electricity. A. Pliusher's Encyclopedic Dictionary (Entsiklopedicheskii leksikon) of 1838 contains a detailed entry on "Galvanism," written by the physicist E.K. Lentz (123-140), who, according to a bulletin issued by the Imperial Ministry of Trade and Commerce, secured his place in contemporary science by virtue of his famous experiments in electromagnetic phenomena (Savel'ev 4-5). The scientific community began to reconsider various pseudoscientific projects by eccentric inventors in light of theories that described electricity as a mystical phenomenon. In 1834, the Petersburg magazine Journal of Manufacture and Trade (Zhurnal manufaktur i torgovli) published an article, "New Machine for Perpetual Circular Motion," which declared that a member of the Imperial Academy of Science, B.S. lakobi, had succeeded in constructing a perpetuum mobile with electricity as its driving</page><page sequence="5">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 53 fuel; this machine for defying the laws of physics was first conceived in medieval alchemy and remains impossible to manufacture to this day (?10:460- 61). Mesmer's conception of electricity as universal flow between the concrete and ethereal, individual and universal, existential and essential facets of being also resonated with panpsychic perceptions of the creative process in Romantic thought. Unlike Radishchev, who portrayed electricity as a frightening but nevertheless tractable force, writers such as Alexander Pushkin and Nikolai Gogol-prominent figures of the "Golden Age" of Russian literature-conflated the terms galvanism, magnetism, mesmerism, and electricity to connote explicitly animistic phenomena impenetrable to both rational understanding and technological manipulation. Electricity in this particular connotation recurs frequently in their treatises on aesthetic theory and creativity. Gogol, in an analysis of dramatic arts called "Theatrical Digressions" ("Teatral'nyi raz'ezd" 1836-42), compares the formal features of a literary masterpiece with a perfect machine but its essence, the ineffable "soul," to electricity (190). Invoking the implementation of mesmerism in psychological treatments, he instructs actors of his famous play The Inspector General (Revizor 1836) to transfix the audience with a mysterious "shock" (8). Pushkin, in his essay "Refutation to Criticism" ("Oproverzhenie na kritiki" 1830), explains the process of poetic creation through the metaphor of an electrical circuit: epiphany occurs at the juncture where the dead substantive comes to life by getting "electrically charged" through verbs ("neuzhto elektricheskaia sila dolzhna proiti cherez vsiu tsep' glagolov i otozvat'sia v sushchestvitel'nom" 185). The dominant mode of viewing electricity as a psychic phenomenon penetrated Pushkin's fantastic fiction as well: in the novella "The Queen of Spades" ("Pikovaia dama" 1834), an old countess, who was a socialite in France at the very peak of the occult electricity fad, acquires prophetic powers under the influence of "secret galvanism" ("pod vliianiem skrytogo galvanizma" 339). Pushkin's and Gogol's imagery illustrate the ways in which electric trances and shock-induced fortune telling, which had become popular salon games, provided an important frame of reference for articulating the aesthetics of Romanticism in Russia. Literary figures had also been influenced by the works of German Romanticists, who reinterpreted electricity in terms of the neoplatonic doctrine of innate universal sympathies. The intimacy and eroticism pervading Pushkin's and Gogol's diction echo E.T.A. Hoffman's story "Der Magnetiseur" (1826), in which the protagonist draws out all the rays from inside his beloved and weaves her into himself; they also echo Goethe's conversations with Eckermann (1823-32), "We all have some electrical and magnetic forces within us; with lovers this magnetic force is particularly strong" (190). As an incident in Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina (1873-76) demonstrates, electricity was simultaneously imbued with feminine sexuality and discussed as an occult phenomenon in aristocratic circles until late in the nineteenth century. In a charged moment of ideological and emotional confrontation, the pragmatist hero, Levm, accuses his beloved and her aristocratic companions of indulging in table- turning and mediumism. His rival Vronskii retorts, "We acknowledge the</page><page sequence="6">54 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) existence of electricity, even though we do not know it; why can't you admit there may be other sorts of energy that we have not yet named?" ("My dopuskaem sushchestvovanie elektrichestva, kotorogo my ne znaem; pochemu zhe ne mozhet byt' novaia sila, eshche nam neizvestna?" [60]). The diametrically opposite views of electricity dominating Enlightenment and Romantic discourses did not come into contact until they were fused together in what is generally acknowledged as the first utopian science fiction in Russian literature. Prince Vladimir Fedorovich Odoevskii, a scientist, philosopher, and social activist, made electricity the central component in his vision of the future, an unfmished novella titled "The Year 4338" ("4338 god"), which he developed from the 1830s until his death in 1864. Odoevskii was also the first visionary to predict the multifarious effects of mass electrification. He describes Russia poised at the brink of world leadership through successful implementation of electric power: "Galvanostats" ("balloons powered by electricity") serve as the chief mode of transport in the Petersburg of the future (418), electric lights sparkle from crystal roofs of houses (421), and the "magnetic telegraph," closely resembling contemporary electronic mail, has made communications almost instantaneous (448). The topography of Odoevskii's narrative also suggests that electric power would determine political economy in the coming world-a correlation that was rearticulated in Lenin's famous call for electrification. Even though Odoevskii extrapolated the potential of electricity as both literal and figurative source of power, he placed equal emphasis on the view that it would transform thought, ethics, and ideology. His science fiction depicts the important role that electricity would play in creating the psychological and cognitive contours of future humans. Galvanism and Mesmerism feature in his utopia as methods to improve the intellectual and moral fiber of the ruling classes in the fifth millennium. Cabinet ministers, scientists, writers, and artists subject themselves to "magnetic baths" in order to cultivate creativity, honesty, and honor (439). The function of such baths is to alter consciousness and aid catharsis of repressed thoughts, prefiguring the scientific preeminence that electrical therapy would achieve at the turn of the century through the experiments of eminent psychologists such as Jules Charcot in France and Herbert von Helmholz in Germany. The fusion of projected material and psychological functions of electricity in Odoevskii's fiction extends to his philosophical writings. He accorded tremendous significance to it while formulating a new epistemology called "The New Enlightenment, " which purportedly resolved the opposition of mind versus matter, and rational versus intuitive approaches to knowledge. In an unpublished essay titled "Electropsychical Phenomena" ("Elektropsikhicheskiia iavleniia") he contended that the advent of electricity would finally achieve an epistemological impossibility by empirically disproving all forms of dualism (National Public Library archives file 53: folio 39). An ardent admirer of the German transcendentalists, Odoevskii declared that electricity was the only phenomenon through which the mechanistically-oriented scientific mind could begin to comprehend what lay beyond empirical observation and connect with</page><page sequence="7">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 55 the Absolute. The fictional galvanic baths in "The Year 4338" were, in fact, his suggested means for attaining a state in which humans could bridge the rift between understanding and intuition. "In the highest magnetized state," he wrote, "pure instinct and pure reason come together" ("V vysshem sostoianii magnetizma sol'iutsia naivysshii instinkt s razumom," NPL file 79: folio 46). The universalism implied in Odoevskii's philosophy does not mitigate the fact that his vision of a future "electrified" world is unrepentantly Russocentric. Electricity serves as both metaphor and projected medium for his prediction that Russia would one day play a preceptor's role in areas of both material progress and cognitive insight. His unique formula for utopia-simultaneously cultivating the technological and epistemological potentials of electricity-remained an isolated instance of esoteric visionary thinking until the turn of the century, when a single innovation, Edison's light bulb, catapulted the heretofore obscure source of energy into a subject of worldwide speculation and introduced the term "electricity" to the popular lexicon in Russia. The advent of mass media in Russia at the turn of the twentieth century, which, incidentally, coincided with the scientific and technological revolution in the West, transformed the way people thought about modernity. The media opened up cutting-edge science and technology to hitherto excluded sections of society. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, only cosmopolitan aristocrats or isolated scholars traveling abroad could know about or speculate upon the latest scientific theories and technological inventions. Starting from the 1880s, in contrast, numerous illustrated journals made such information accessible to a wide social spectrum, especially in urban centers with a burgeoning middle class. The appearance of several large-circulation popular science journals at the same time, such as Around the World (Vokrug sveta) and Nature and People (Priroda i liudi), attests to the growing popular enthusiasm about transformative technologies. Electricity, the new source of power that promised to change night into day, revolutionize communications, and radically affect systems of production and consumption, emerged at the forefront of Russian media. In Russia as in the West, Edison's incandescent light bulb began to serve as the universal metonym for the emergence of the technological age. Both Around the World and Nature and People adopted the electric bulb as their emblem. The former included Edison's lamp on its cover; the jacket of the latter depicted a landscape with electric wires criss-crossing the sky. An image of the electric bulb appeared at the head of a column in Around the World that reported on the latest scientific discoveries and technological inventions. Specialized periodicals sprang up to inform the amateur reader about electrical energy. The first issue of The Journal of Latest Discoveries and Inventions (Zhurnal noveishikh otkrytii i izobretenii) in 1900 offered two free supplements about "electricity in domestic use." All through the same year, the illustrated weekly The Field (Niva) carried numerous articles and pictures of the special pavilion on "Electricity" that was erected at the World's Fair in Paris. It also devoted an issue to the newly electrified Paris subway system. As the above examples illustrate, media enthusiasm in Russia about the transformative effects of electricity closely echoed that in the West. But the</page><page sequence="8">56 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) resemblance ends there, because electricity did not leave the domain of utopian speculation to become an object of everyday reality in Russia as it did in Germany and the United States. Historiography explains the chief cause for this disparity: Coopersmith, while acknowledging that individual engineers and investors at various times pushed to adopt the new source of energy, describes how a rigid centralized system of promoting and developing new technologies in Tsarist Russia prevented the widespread adoption of electric lighting and communications except in a few isolated urban landmarks. In addition, the Imperial government did not deem new power technology strategically important-as compared to the railways, for instance-until it was proven otherwise in the First World War. Thus, although the readers of newspapers and magazines were well aware of the potential of electric power and lured by advertisements of foreign firms selling electrical trinkets, including lights, phonographs, and radios, the same advertisements show that domestic electrical appliances would remain prohibitively expensive and inaccessible to most of the populace. For example, an electric lamp advertised in Niva in 1910 costs forty rubles; an electric phonograph, seventy-five. As for electrification in public space, neither the limited importation of generating equipment nor its very selective use would dispel the illusion that electric lighting was as immaterial as electricity itself (Coopersmith 142). An interesting compendium of advertisements from 1900 illustrates the gap between the utopian imagination and the implementation of electricity in early twentieth-century Russia. Three different varieties of lamps appear on the same page of Niva (1004b). The most prominent, occupying about a quarter-page, declares: "Light for the Twentieth Century: Kerosene Lamp Orsa." The next box also advertises a kerosene lamp manufactured by the Moscow firm "The Triumph." Compared to the previous two, the least significant in size and strength of rhetoric is an advertisement for the "Electric Lamp" at the bottom of the page. It promises to be odorless and safe, but nevertheless is exorbitantly priced and available at only one outlet in Petersburg. At the threshold of the twentieth century, the smelly kerosene lamp remains a far more accessible and tangible technology in the Russian city than the alien, elitist miracle of electric light. Borrowing the parlance of our times, it may be said that electricity enjoyed a peculiar "virtual existence" in the Russian consciousness. Although its images pervaded the media, its applications remained purely hyperbolic and deferred to an unspecified future. A comparison with the rapidly changing cultural discourse about electricity in America underscores the peculiar status of electricity in the Russian cultural imagination of the same period. In 1890, Mark Twain referred to the new source of energy as "the splendid necromancy of modern science" (32). But whereas a mere ten years later the same Twain could describe how it had lost all mystery by virtue of its incursion into every sphere of private and public life (149), his epithet of "necromantic science" holds true for Russian perceptions well into the post-Revolutionary period. The words "magic" and "miracle" continued to be used in conjunction with electricity through the 1910s in Russian media.</page><page sequence="9">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 57 As discussed earlier in this essay, the representation of electricity as mystical animating force had existed for a far longer time in Russia and bore no relation to indigenous developments in technology and industry. Such a perception resurfaces in turn-of-the-century mass media as an alternative to the absence of concrete electrical technology. The public, unable to experience the miracles wrought by electrification or to afford mechanical trinkets, is offered parapsychological and mystical applications of electricity available to all and sundry. The same large-circulation newspapers and magazines that speculated on how electrification would transform Russia also resurrected nineteenth- century views about electricity as an indefinable vital essence and an agent for transforming the consciousness. Priroda i liudi published reports of the "miraculous" powers of a "Miss Volta," who cured the public with her personal electrical "aura" (1899, ?41:544). Niva speculated upon the powers of a pair of magic healers who could light cigars and lamps from the "electrical tips" of their fingers (1894, ?32:762). Through the 1910s, the Petersburg Stock Exchange News (Birzhevye vedomosti) carried at least ten daily notices from clinics specializing in electrotherapy for mental problems. Classified columns in practically every newspaper announced mesmeric seances, aided by electric shock, in prominent homes. The disparity was glaringly apparent to certain members of the intelligentsia, who were not only better informed about electrification but who also, like Lenin, had sampled its effects during travel abroad. A majority of the populace, in contrast, could only imagine the possible effects of electrical technology on Russian life. At first, such speculations appeared in the media, one of which bore strong resemblance to Odoevskii's exceptional prophetic vision. Niva carried a long feature titled "World Railway" in 1902 which, supported by maps and illustrations, presents a geopolitical image very similar to that of "The Year 4338." The author advanced the theory that electrification of transportation and communications would soon make Petersburg, the Russian capital, the literal center of the world, connected to Paris at one end and Beijing at the other (?152:8). But journalism offered only limited space and scope for such speculations. Detailed, elaborate narratives about the projected forms that electricity and electrification would take in future Russia also appeared in the guise of science fiction. It is noteworthy that the turn of the century marks the first prolific production and consumption of the genre in Russia. Modes of perceiving and representing electricity in science fiction also intersect significantly with those of millennial philosophy and manifestos of movements that explicitly identified themselves as "Modernist." Electricity emerged as a central theme in all the above categories of writing, and was therefore "nationalized" for the first time in the realm of the utopian imagination rather than through the domestication and demystification of technology. All the genres listed above define the relevance of electricity in a common paradigm that attempts to resolve the split in contemporary media representations. Their invariably extrapolative nature mirrors the hyperbolic, deferred modes in which the media speculated about electricity turning long</page><page sequence="10">58 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) winter nights into day or powering transcontinental railways with Petersburg at its center. An acute awareness of Russia's "backwardness" vis-a-vis the West, in which kerosene still reigns as the fuel of the impending twentieth century, forms the backdrop of anxiety to such utopian speculations. Consequently, the second manifestation of electricity readily available to the Russian public, embodied in Miss Volta and the biological cigar-lighters, shock therapy and mesmeric seances, forms an integral part of the utopian imagination at the turn of the century. Indeed, the combination of mechanical and metaphysical applications was often presented as a uniquely "national" insight into the same power technology that the West had reduced to frivolous consumerism. The two inexorably bound conceptions of electricity that constitute the paradigm of such a vision also provide a bridge between Odoevskii's nineteenth- century fantasy, produced at a time when electricity was merely an object of elite esoteric knowledge, and early Bolshevik dreams of electrification, when it had already emerged in the cultural consciousness as the universally- acknowledged driving force of the future. Conflation of the mechanical and metaphysical potentials of electricity, it must be noted, mark both Odoevskii's and Lenin's visions of the way in which electricity would not only put Russia in a preeminent place in the world, but also serve as its unique tool for forging an alternative, non-Western model of modernity. The following sections of this essay demonstrate that early-twentieth-century science fiction not only establishes and enriches the bivalent semantics of electricity but also imbues it with distinctive governing impulses that later came to be associated with Bolshevik visions of modernizing Russia. Before examining the texts themselves, it is worth considering some of these impulses. Coopersmith, for example, identifies the following differences between the Bolshevik electrification plan and Western utopianism around the same technology. In 1920, the aim of electrifying Russia was as much for societal reconstruction as economic growth; in contrast with urbanist and consumerist visions of electrification in the West, it was projected to alleviate rural conditions and thereby bridge the town-country split both in material and cognitive terms. The divergence of values outlined above would cause Russia to develop its own brand of "ethical" modernity and, therefore, lead the rest of the capitalist world toward a similar transformation. Finally, such tendencies are personified in a new character type, the indigenous electrical engineer, who embodies the predominance of knowledge over resources and infrastructure (Coopersmith 151-52). This latter point is crucial not only because it posits a unique connection between national identity and technological utopianism but also because it provides a figure for negotiating Russia's "backwardness" in the eyes of the industrialized world. Science fiction in turn-of-the-century Russia synthesizes conceptions of electricity as combined mechanical and metaphysical force and, through this synthesis, prefigures the peculiar imperatives underlying the Bolshevik discourse about electrification. Typical of this tendency is the treatment of mechanical marvels wrought by electricity. They do not constitute the focus of speculative narratives; instead, discussions of the abstract cognitive functions of electricity</page><page sequence="11">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 59 as harbinger of ethical and ideological change dominate both popular and "serious" science fiction of the age. The only exception is a popular science- fiction novel, Vladimir Chikolev's Electrical Tale: It Never Happened, but it is Not Imaginary (Elektricheskii rasskaz: Ne bylo, no i ne vydumka 1895), which includes long descriptions of gadgets-obvious extrapolations of those advertised in the press-and constructs a simple portrait of material comfort. Much more representative of the trends outlined above is the science fiction of Konstantin Sluchevskii. Sluchevskii, best known as a tum-of-the-century metaphysical poet, turned to science fiction in order to defme the unique opportunity electricity presented for Russia to forge a path to modernity distinctive from the West. He published a utopian novella, "Captain Nemo in Russia" ("Kapitan Nemo v Rossii" 1892), as an overt literary and ideological response to the functional relationship the West had developed with science and technology. The narrative features the world-famous hero of Jules Verne's 20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea (1870) traveling to a remote island on the White Sea, where a Russian called Fitzroy is said to have created lush farmlands out of frozen Arctic wastes. What sets Nemo and the Russian protagonist apart is precisely their attitude towards the applications of electricity. The Frenchman's most dramatic achievement is running a submarine with self-generated electricity, thus wasting its limitless potentials for nurturing a brand of Romantic isolation. Fitzroy, in contrast, is a recuperated myth of Lomonosov: not only does he inhabit an island close to the eighteenth-century scientist's hometown, Arkhangelsk, but his vision is steeped in a brand of social consciousness characteristic of Enlightenment thought in Russia. Rather than harness electricity to satisfy his own wanderlust, the Russian inventor utilizes it for alleviating two existential concerns of the local peasantry, lack of food and lack of education. Climate control enables local farmers to produce bumper crops during the day and electric light transforms their consciousness as they can now study by night. Sluchevskii's novella prefigures the iconography underlying Lenin's call for electrification. It identifies electricity as a force that simultaneously resurrects the body and kindles the mind. With nationalistic fervor, the Russian hero proclaims to Nemo that his gifted assistant is not of French or British origin as the visitor presumes, but is "a local peasant, a samorodok purer than gold, from the kingdom of darkness and tallow candles" ("On mestnyi krestianin, samorodok chishche zolota, iz tsarstva temnoty i sal'nykh svechei," 50). Juxtaposed with the rather obvious metonymy of electricity as Enlightenment, the term samorodok, which means self-born, is particularly significant in this context. It is a nationalistic, anti-Western mythical construct of knowledge that Slavophiles coined in the mid-nineteenth century. Applied for the first time to Lomonosov, samorodok denotes an autodidact who derives his insights far away from European institutions, immersing himself in organically developed traditions of the "Russian folk" (Galavanova 129). Sluchevskii's science fiction embodies the critical transition point when electricity passed from the realm of nineteenth-century intellectual speculation to twentieth-century popular utopianism. First, his sf projects that electricity, at the time an esoteric urban luxury, would one day become the most powerful</page><page sequence="12">60 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) weapon for fighting starvation and illiteracy among the vast rural masses. Such a fantasy reinforces the idea that only electricity is capable of removing the insurmountable barriers of class identity, not only in material terms but also by bridging the rift of intellect and world-views between the Westernized urban intelligentsia and the peasantry. Second, it posits that electricity is a suitable instrument only for a special category of visionaries-the Russian samorodok. Like Fitzroy, German by birth yet Russian nationalist in spirit, inventive specialists in electrical technology would cultivate progressive scientific knowledge yet carve a path of technological development quite distinct from the West. The distinctive modes of representing electricity in Sluchevskii's science fiction find close resonance in the philosophical treatises of Nikolai Fedorov, the preeminent millenialist thinker in fm-de-siecle Russia. Fedorov, who influenced many prominent intellectuals but also commanded a sizable mass following, incarnated the symbiosis of scientist and samorodok in real life. Trained in higher physics and mathematics, this visionary chose electricity as the chief instrument for a utopian project he claimed would save both Russia and the world. His project was directly inspired by an article published in the journal Russkaia starina in 1873 about Nikolai Karazin, a nineteenth-century Russian scientist who had first conceived a plan for artificially controlling climate with the help of atmospheric electric currents (Fedorov ?2:276). Fedorov delineated his project in great detail in a monumental work, Philosophy of the Common Task (Filosofiia obshchego dela 1906-13), in which he designates electricity as the only force that can eliminate hunger in rural Russia. In order to avert the Malthusian nightmare of overpopulation and food shortage, he suggests numerous "rationally extrapolated" plans to transform vast northern wastelands. They range from planting lightning rods for summoning rain from the heavens to an elaborate scheme of using electrodes to change the earth's axis and convert Siberia into arable farmland (?2:252-53). While the technological fantasies in Fedorov's work address the plight of agrarian Russia, the eschatological appeal of his project rests on a plan to magically reanimate the dead in a manner not unlike Frankenstein's monster. Electricity, he claims, should be used for galvanizing simultaneously the mortal remains of the dead collected from all over the world (?1:475). Resurrecting common ancestors would reestablish the genealogical connections among all men and usher in a new era of egalitarian "Christian Brotherhood." In nearly identical terms as Odoevskii, Fedorov asserts that electricity is the special means by which human beings would meet both their physical and spiritual needs in the future and Russia would resolve the dichotomy between Eastern and Western cognition. He explicitly states that electricity is the only futuristic technology that would bridge the gap between irrational faith and cold Reason (?1:30-3 1). Eschatological philosophy was not the only sphere in which the mechanistic and metaphysical potentials of electricity were extrapolated and synthesized to form a colossal myth of salvation. A pair of unusually correlated science-fiction texts-one written by an obscure popular author, the other by the chief ideologue of the Russian Symbolist movement-represent electricity as a</page><page sequence="13">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 61 combined conduit of physical resurrection and psychic transfiguration in the imminent future. The popular science-fiction writer Vladimir Shelonskii interwove the two aspects in a utopian novel titled In the Future World (V mire budushchego, 1892). This work is modeled on a traditional voyage imaginaire with one crucial difference-the spaceship that transports an eclectic group of scientists and philosophers to the North Pole runs on electric power. Such a substitution of the magic carpet with futuristic machine is hardly remarkable, but a matrix of spiritual allusions transforms this tale of adventure on an electric ship into a uniquely Russian allegory of Resurrection. The protagonists choose electricity as the only force strong enough to match the ultimate objective of their quest, Polnoch', or the "Midnight Land." According to scholars of utopian folklore, the term originated in a sixteenth-century legend of fugitive Old Believers who wandered about in Siberia looking for an undiscovered section of the Arctic where nobody ever grew old (Klibanov 231). By enabling humans to reach the mythic space, electricity in turn-of-the-century science fiction evolves into a technological means to achieve immortality. Like Sluchevskii and Fedorov, the author ascribes the conception of the project to a Russian electrical engineer, Kirill, who incarnates both sophisticated scientist and peasant magus. Kirill, rather than his European and American companions, solves the problem of constructing a battery that can store enough electrical energy to last the duration of the journey: after much trial and error, he receives a dream revelation that gold is the only appropriate medium for trapping electricity. Shelonskii's narrative bears remarkable resemblance to a work composed by one of the most prominent intellectuals of early twentieth-century Russia. Speculation about the transfiguring powers of electricity no doubt inspired the Symbolist poet and aesthetician Andrei Belyi to adopt it as the central element of his only experiment in science fiction. Belyi's short story of 1904, "The Argonauts" ("Argonavty"), is set in the twenty-third century and works on three levels of symbolic representation. The plot, like Shelonskii's novel, consists of a perilous journey in an electrical spaceship. Its passengers call themselves "Argonauts"-an obvious allusion to the myth of Jason seeking the Golden Fleece-and choose an engineer who also possesses prophetic powers as leader of the group. This Russian engineer uses gold to construct and propel the fantastic vessel, trapping large amounts of electricity in its golden scales; after many trials, he leads the group into a magical space where their bodies turn into golden rays and their minds connect with the transcendental noumenon. The story also contains an autobiographical subtext that transforms it from fiction into an epistemological and aesthetic manifesto. It presents, in narrative form, the quest the writer and his fellows undertook under the umbrella of the literary group "Argonaut. " Both Shelonskii's adventure tale and Belyi's symbolist narrative focus on the connection between two key elements: electricity and gold. Electricity represents the technical means to embark on the journey. Gold not only serves as the physical medium for conducting and storing electricity but also stands for the ultimate objective of the quest-a form of rapture in which the body becomes immortal and, in Belyi's story, metamorphoses from matter to energy.</page><page sequence="14">62 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) Shelonskii's and especially Belyi's works demonstrate that visionary mechanical applications of electricity in turn-of-the-century science fiction could not be separated from the second, mystical strain in which contemporary media perceived and represented it. Images of electricity rendering humans immortal and transforming physical bodies into transcendental energy evoke the stories about Miss Volta, biological cigar-lighters, and shock-induced otherworldly experiences mentioned earlier in this essay. The association of electricity with gold, moreover, elaborates a new category of speculation about purported parapsychological applications of electricity that came into vogue in Russia in the late 1890s. Alchemy-which means transmutation-involves creating gold by transforming base metals through fire. This ultimate substance, medieval scientists believed, was a panacea for solving all ills, including old age and death. The writings of some nineteenth-century parapsychologists who hailed electricity as the magic fire that alchemists had been unable to craft were first translated into Russian at the turn of the century and attained considerable popularity. One of them, the celebrated Victorian mesmerist William Carpenter, contended that electricity would unlock the secrets of transubstantiation, not only by turning metals into gold but also by changing the body to immortal spirit. Carpenter's book, translated in 1901, created equally wide ripples in popular science journals and "thick" magazines targeted at the discerning intelligentsia. While Nature and People presented a series of articles on the mesmerists' teachings (1900, ?8-9:455-6, 521-3), the highly respected monthly European Messenger (Evropeiskii vestnik) published the translation of one of his lectures (1901, ?2: 925-32). The revival of Galvanic perceptions of electricity, along with the view that it embodied the alchemist's fire, even permeated the discourse of academic journals. Issues of Philosophy and Psychology (Voprosy filosofii i psikhologii), the prestigious scholarly publication, printed an article on galvanic reanimation in which the author specifically recommends golden electrical circuits (see Glagolev). Following Belyi, other Symbolist writers adopted electricity as the most potent metaphor for transcendence and the resolution of historic dualities. They expressly privileged the metaphysical properties of electricity rather than cultivating its implications for material life or systems of production. Prominent representatives of the movement, such as the poet Alexander Blok, admired Odoevskii's fiction and pondered "necromantic" applications of electricity such as modern alchemy, galvanic rejuvenation, and mesmeric medicine (Lukirskaia ?2:178). Some Symbolists turned their gaze on the rapid domestication of electricity in the West; but rather than demystifying it for the Russian audience, they bemoaned the profanation of a mysterious cosmic force in the name of progress. The most prolific science-fiction writer among them, Valerii Briusov, predicted an apocalyptic moment in the near future when the irrational "essence" of electricity would wreak vengeance upon a humanity blinded by the material comforts provided by technology. In real life, Briusov retained a paranoid fear of the invisible occult powers of electricity: a fellow writer, Vladislav Khodasevich, noted that he always</page><page sequence="15">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 63 switched the lights off before exiting a room (32). On the eve of the First World War, Briusov published a science-fiction tale titled "Rebellion of the Machines" ("Vosstanie mashin," 1914) that thematized the implosion of society in the impending technological age. The world erupts into mayhem when the appliances and electrical grids citizens depend upon develop a "diabolic logic" ("d'iavolskii razum," 103) of their own and take over. In images evocative of Romantic conceptions of electricity, domestic artifacts such as light bulbs, telephones, and radios begin to personify and respond to the humans' repressed anxieties. A "nervous explosion" destroys the global village that so far had been organized not according to geographical boundaries but interconnected "power zones" (100-101). While Briusov conceived of an electrical discharge as deadly rather than liberating, many of his contemporaries enthusiastically adopted the image of an electric spark instantly destroying the existing order of things and transfiguring the consciousness of the people. The term "electrifying" appears in a Russian journalistic lexicon in 1917 as a metaphor for the unrest consuming intellectuals and proletariat alike. "The political atmosphere is electrified," writes Nikolai Shelgunov, a prominent journalist and leftist activist, on the eve of the Revolution; "everyone's heightened consciousness will explode into a single electric discharge" ("V politicheskoi atmosfere elektrichestvo ... vozbuzhdennoe sostoianie vsekh razorvetsia v edinuiu razriadku," 122). Not surprisingly, razriadka, the electric discharge, became a fetish of the Futurist movement in Russia. Unlike the Symbolists, Futurists did not regard the various, sometimes contradictory connotations of electricity-agent of apocalypse, medium of resurrection, facilitator of superior lighting and communication-as separate and mutually exclusive categories. Like the Italian Futurist Filippo Marinetti hailing "the reign of Holy Electric Light come to liberate Venice from venal moonshine" (63), the movement adopted electricity in toto as the most potent embodiment of its philosophical, social, and aesthetic agenda. The shock of an electric current was the perfect metaphor for articulating the mortal blow Futurists wished to deliver to existing social and artistic hierarchies. More radical members of the movement, such as Velimir Khlebnikov, declared that such a shock would remove desiderata of the past, purge the present of its falsehoods, and provide the necessary prelude to a future utopia in which electricity would play a constructive role in reorganizing both material life and human cognition. Khlebnikov developed this theme by synthesizing positivistic and mystical perceptions of electricity in a completely new paradigm: rejecting the classical myth of Prometheus traditionally used in the imagery of electricity, he turned to archetypal Slavic beliefs to articulate its relevance in a future Russia. According to Afanas'ev, whose commentaries on folklore exerted a decisive influence on Khlebnikov's imagery, lightning was long perceived to be the divine agent that generated the universe from chaotic matter. The God Perun is believed to have animated and spiritualized the earth's dead flesh by touching it with his sword of heavenly fire, the pre-Christian logos (125-35). Consequently, Khlebnikov eschewed the term "electricity" in favor</page><page sequence="16">64 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) of the archaism molniia, meaning lightning, in the numerous instances when he envisioned its future forms and functions. Khlebnikov turned to the bivalent image of electricity to explain his epistemological and aesthetic aims. In a letter to fellow-Futurist Alexei Kruchenykh, he defines modern electric power as the reincarnation of primordial lightning. He outlines its tremendous potential for reconstituting not just material life but also language, that primary extension of the human consciousness. Futurist language, he contended, was an "electrical discharge" (razriad) because it broke down stratifications of "high" and "low," "intellectual" and "folk" ("Neizdannye proizvedeniia" 367). It is noteworthy that this programmatic declaration closely prefigures, albeit through the metaphor of language, the special meaning Bolshevik utopianism accorded electricity as a leveler of social difference. Khlebnikov encoded his vision of a world created and unified by electricity in an elaborate cosmogonic myth composed between 1915 and 1921, a period beginning before the Revolution and ending after the Civil War. In a utopia set in the future, he casts the ancient deities Perun as feminine "lightning sisters," Sestry molnii, who become "the only Gods" of the future: "Az esm' bog/ I ne budet tebe/ Drugikh bogov/ Krome menia" (157). The story of creation revolves around the premise that a revolutionary transformation of humanity's envirorment-such as that posited by a Marxist revolution-would remain meaningless until the "talking sword" ("govoriashchaia mech") kindles the human spirit (158). Khlebnikov conceives of electricity as a cosmic feminine principle. Lightning is the power animating the New Man, who is portrayed as both technician and poet: his mechanical or artistic creations remain lifeless until fired by the electric spark of inspiration. Lightning is the feminine "muse" ("zhena poeta") that injects life into unborn words and vast future construction sites that only exist as blueprints in the imagination (170). Such feminization of electricity stands out in the very masculinist cult of the machine pervading Futurist diction. But Khlebnikov's bipartite model of electricity-masculine power technology complemented by, and indeed dependent upon, feminine creative and animistic impulse-has quite a few counterparts in contemporary literature from both Russia and the West. The Russian poet Zinaida Hippius represented an electrical circuit as a set of sexual opposites in her 1901 poem, "Electricity" ("Elektrichestvo"). Anode and cathode, while separate, stand for unresolved dichotomies not just between positives and negatives but also between noumenon and phenomenon, flesh and spirit, death and life, the past and the present. Their coming together at the end of the poem constitutes at once an explosive orgasm-denoted by razriadka, the same term as electrical discharge and catharsis-and transcendence from duality. The resulting spark causes instantaneous death to the entities of anode and cathode, but also ushers in the blinding light of Resurrection ("I smert' ikh budet svet"). The Italian Futurist Marinetti, who exerted a direct influence on Khlebnikov, not only deified electricity but also, in a play variously titled between 1905 and 1925 as "La donna e mobile," "Elettricita sessuale," and</page><page sequence="17">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 65 "Fantocci elettrici, " envisioned the future human being as an explicitly feminine marionette animated by an electrical circuit connected to its head and loins. The American writer Henry Adams chose almost identical terms in the essay "The Virgin and the Dynamo" (1901) to articulate the momentous role of the new source of energy: he describes the generator as an animated, "fecund" machine that has replaced the sterile goddesses of previous ages (107). Like a number of avant-garde writers and artists, Khlebnikov committed himself after 1917 to devising utopian projects that were meant to be translated into reality. Electricity forms the basis of the most elaborate of his plans. A series of housing and education projects, "Homesteads from the Future" ("Kol iz budushchego," 1918-21), which the poet composed after the long-awaited catharsis of the October Revolution had taken place, represent electricity as a consummation of physical power and ideological/spiritual energy, a spectacular result of the contact between masculine human endeavor and the feminine heavenly spark of lightning. The landscape of future Russia is dotted with transformers and radio towers, monumental structures of electrical technology that also serve as anthropomorphic totems. The steel giants bridge heaven and earth through "hairs of lightning" ("volosy molnii"), serving as conduits for Perun's divine logos. Electricity operates in this fictional reality as the metonym for internationalist egalitarianism. Such egalitarianism is brought about, however, by a successful synthesis of its material and metaphysical functions: power stations and radio towers not only disseminate light and information in Khlebnikov's utopia but also serve the more abstract role of transforming the consciousness of humankind. They fuse hitherto disparate units of society into a "harmonious world-soul" ("Dvoinye bogi molnii i radio ob'ediniat dushu vsego chelovechestva" [?4:294]). It is probable that this mystical perception of electricity-which imbued it with an unsullied aura of the virginal, non-corporeal, divine, and miraculous- aided its survival as one of the few icons of true utopian thought in the years of chaos and privation that followed 1917. The continued absence of electricity from everyday life further contributed to its potential for becoming the only untainted myth of salvation. The worst years of War Communism were also the period when the government first began to valorize mass electrification, with Lenin's official declaration marking the culmination of the movement. With electrification still a purely utopian dream, however, more synergy than divergence can be observed between the visionary fictional imagination of the early twentieth century and Bolshevik rhetoric about instantly modernizing Russia. Historical perspectives on GOELRO describe it as a combination of "visionary speculation" and "desperate measure" (Stites 46); the same intersection of attitudes canbe observed in Khlebnikov's pronouncement in 1920 that "electricity is now the only force that can conquer tears" ("Sestry molnii" 168). In the economic and social devastation following the Civil War, while the actual production of electricity plummeted, speculation around its magical power for resuscitating both body and morale survived both in ideological manifestos and science fiction. Andrei Platonov, an engineer inspired greatly by GOELRO,</page><page sequence="18">66 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) began his involvement with the Bolshevik electrification plan at the level of local politics in his provincial hometown, Voronezh, in the Tambov region. His first response to Lenin's slogan, a pamphlet addressed to workers and technicians of the local Party cell, reflects the results of the Revolutionary government's efforts to actively involve the technocratic intelligentsia in the utopian dream of electrification. Coopersmith and Stites discuss at length the measures taken to achieve this aim, among them publication of new journals such as Economics, Labor, and Technology (Ekonomika, trud, i tekhnika), to which Platonov subscribed (Abramov 178). In 1921, Platonov composed a pamphlet titled "Electrification" ("Elektrifikatsiia"). The rhetoric of this ostensibly "informational" essay, however, closely mirrors the continuum of modes in which electricity was extrapolated inpre-Revolutionary and early Bolshevik periods. Enumerating the radical effects of electrification on rural Russian life, the author resorts to the bivalent paradigm of its mechanical and metaphysical potentials. While the pamphlet contains many exegeses about how electrification will bridge the rift between town and country, radically improve both industrial and agricultural labor, and change the quality of life for workers and peasants, it also describes the Revolution as a mystical cosmic event, a lightning discharge ("razriad molnii," 2), an "explosion" ("vzryv") that has changed the world (3). Along with expressing hope that electricity will save historically deprived sections of Soviet society, Platonov also proclaims that it is the new instrument for transforming their consciousness. Not only would electrification provide shorter working days and domestic comfort to workers, but would also produce a complete change in the indefinable "essence" ("sut'") of the proletariat (9). In contrast, Platonov's fictional extrapolation of his experience while trying to "electrify" rural Russia problematizes the optimistic metaphors of his manifesto. His 1926 story "The Homeland of Electricity" is set far from urban and even provincial technological centers in the middle of nowhere-a perfect topological setting for hyperbolic enactment of utopianism. The inhabitants of this unnamed Russian village, ravaged by war and famine to the extent that their bodies are literally shrinking with hunger, are ready to receive any succor available. Paradoxically, lack of equipment and information-the village is allotted a broken-down generator with no fuel supply-places them in a pre- GOELRO time warp when electricity simply did not exist in its mechanical manifestation. Their perceptions and representations of electrification, therefore, are strictly metaphysical and rendered through a rich spectrum of metaphors-not from contemporary propaganda but from pre-Revolutionary science fiction. Platonov depicts the villagers' assessments of electricity in palpable intertextual connection with Pushkin, Hippius, and Khlebnikov's formulations of the mysterious energy. The generator represents an animate, supernatural, feminine being for them, and Party rhetoric becomes an object of superstitious faith. Women compare it with a miracle-working icon of the Madonna, a heavenly intercessor mitigating drought and famine and restoring the fecundity of the earth; men assign it the status of a Red Worker sent by the authorities to "correct" their ideological orientation (42, 46).</page><page sequence="19">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 67 The narrator-protagonist of Andrei Platonov's story, a mechanic summoned from town to help the villagers, constitutes an alter ego of the author. The character seems to be caught in the rift between rhetoric and reality, and his subjective perceptions literalize the paradox of rural electrification-the ambitious principal goal of GOELRO (Coopersmith 163). Full of "official" optimism about electrifying Russia, he arrives at the village only to find himself in a completely surreal environment. At first he is skeptical about the villagers' adoration of the generator, but in the absence of infrastructure needed to realize a technological utopia, he begins to accord it the same anthropomorphic or divine status. In order to provide the necessary energy for starting the dynamo, he first attempts to fuel it with grain liquor-a profane waste of the plentiful "bread" promised in the Third International-and then coaxes out his own "vital energy" ("energiia zhizni," 36) to start the recalcitrant machine ("mashina" in Russian is grammatically feminine). Following the directives of the local council, he attempts to educate the villagers in the new-fangled source of energy. But scientific, mechanistic explanations completely fail their purpose, and the protagonist fmally resorts to the same metaphysical sources as Futurists in an earlier era. Citing folkloristic myths of creation, he sums up the definition of electricity in purely metaphorical terms: "It is molniia, lightning ... the spirit of the Gods" ("Eto molniia ... dusha bogov," 40). Electricity in the discourse of early twentieth-century Russia serves as a rich and powerful illustration of the role science fiction plays in transforming technology from commodity to cultural metaphor. The process is especially significant in contexts where the dissemination and familiarization of technology is uneven. Electricity in Russia was first popularized by science fiction and mass media at the turn of the century and then designated the most immediate instrument of modernity in early Bolshevik discourse. But electrification remained a myth all through the massive changes overtaking the country. Historiography on the subject demonstrates that mass electrification did not occur to any significant extent until the mid-1920s. This essay points out not only that such a confluence of circumstances causes certain technologies to be selected over others as potent repositories of utopian speculation, but also that the modes of such speculation remain constant through very different historical conditions privileging radically diverse cultural discourses. Electricity in the context of early twentieth-century Russia exemplifies the process outlined above. While in the nineteenth century-with the obvious exception of Odoevskii's science fiction-its perception as elitist, esoteric object of knowledge dominated both Western and Russian cultural discourse, only at the turn of the twentieth century do we observe them diverging. The initial excitement about electric lighting and power in Russian culture closely follows its Western counterpart. Electricity was the most marvelous artifact of the technological revolution because of both material and epistemological reasons. It symbolized the end of mechanistic explanations of reality that had dominated scientific thought since the eighteenth century. Unlike gas or steam, its production was impervious to empirical observation; electricity was a form of energy itself rather than a material generator of energy. In the West, however,</page><page sequence="20">68 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) this mystique dissolved quickly as it developed into a palpable instrument of modernity and ushered in a "techno-economic revolution" (Mandel 118). In Russia, despite the fact that cosmopolitan journalists and visionary intellectuals recognized its potential, electricity did not begin to transform material life and production systems until the late 1920s. The unique "Russian" formula for utopia through electrification arose from the absence of both first-hand knowledge and technological infrastructure-two conditions that Harold Segel identifies as imperative for a viable model for technological utopia (cited in Coopersmith 152). As demonstrated in this essay, in the absence of the two conditions, the cultural imagination recuperated nineteenth-century perceptions of electricity, conflated them with mechanical applications recognized in the early twentieth century, and emphasized its potential to transform consciousness. The bivalent semiotic paradigm for perceiving and representing electricity proved particularly conducive for Russian utopian visions both before and after the Revolution, because it corresponded with historically entrenched tendencies to construct national identity in explicit opposition to the West. Predicated in Odoevskii's novella, this paradigm developed into a full-blown, alternative, "non-Western" model of modernity in Russian cultural discourse, and was disseminated prolifically through intertextual imagery in science fiction, utopian philosophy, and aesthetic theory from Sluchevskii through Khlebnikov. Most interesting, however, is the continued relevance of this model in early Bolshevik imaginations of the future, whether in Lenin's slogan, Puni's posters, Platonov's manifesto, or his fiction. Such continuity is attributable to the fact that the set of conditions and impulses governing pre-Revolutionary utopian portraits of an "electrified" Russia had not changed significantly at the time GOELRO was conceived and would not change until later in the decade. Like the pre-Revolutionary science-fictional imagination, the Bolshevik electrification plan hoped to inspire the Western world with a distinctive set of ideological and ethical goals. Resistance to the "coldly rational," "capitalist," "consumerist," Western perception of electricity, along with hopes of resolving the town-country split and class differences, characterized practically all extrapolations of electrical technology earlier in the twentieth century. Assessments of Bolshevik utopianism are usually circumscribed by the chronological boundaries of the Revolution and the discursive boundaries of propaganda. It is true that electrification evolved into an important theme in Socialist Realist novels such as Marietta Shaginian's Hydrocentral (1931) aiid Galina Nikolaeva's Harvest (Zhatva 1951); but those works, composed when the electrification plan was no longer a utopian dream but already a significant component of Soviet life, deserve quite a different kind of investigation. This study limits itself to the period when electrification in Russia dwelled strictly in the imagination, and hence turns its gaze backwards from 1921. The experiment proves that seemingly radical elements of the Bolshevik vision, such as the construction of a technological utopia in a traditionally "backward" agrarian society, originated and developed in the era that it actively tried to negate.</page><page sequence="21">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 69 WORKS CITED Abramov, A.M.

ABSTRACT Through an examination of electricity in early-twentieth-century Russian literature, this essay demonstrates how science fiction provides a crucial discursive site for analyzing the continuity between constructs of technological utopia and concepts of modernity in</page><page sequence="23">ELECTRICITY IN EARLY RUSSIAN SF 71 the pre-Revolutionary and Bolshevik eras. It delineates the process through which peculiarities of technological development in Russia determined the emergence of a particular semiotic paradigm in pre-Revolutionary speculative fiction about electricity that was absorbed seamlessly into the rhetoric of the Bolshevik electrification plan of 1920. The essay pays special attention to the intertextual dependency of science fiction upon the many cultural discourses of the period, such as canonical and popular literature, mass media, advertisements, dictionaries and encyclopedias, popular philosophy, and aesthetic theory.</page></plain_text>
