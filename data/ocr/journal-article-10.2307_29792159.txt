Archaeology Division National Museum Manila, Philippines Introduction This paper summarizes the archaeological research in the Philippines from 1982 to 1992. It complements the previous papers written by Evan gelista (1969) on archaeology in the Philippines to 1950 and Ronquillo (1985) on archaeological research in the Philippines, 1951-1983. The pur? pose of this paper is to bring researchers, scholars and the general public up-to-date on the development of archaeological work in the Philippines during the last decade. It will attempt to look at the theoretical direction of archaeology in the country. Brief Historical Background A number of papers have been written concerning the development of archaeology in the Philippines from the time of Alfred Marche in 1881 to the coming of H. Otley Beyer in 1905. Beyer was a trained geologist and a school teacher, who developed an interest in anthropological work. He was active in the field from the time of his arrival until his death in 1966. His most important work was done in the late 1940s. Still during the early pe? riod, Carl Guthe, an archaeologist of the University of Michigan, con? ducted a somewhat systematic survey of prehispanic materials found in central Philippines between 1921-1924. *Paper presented at the Conference on Development of Archaeology in Southeast Asia, March 8-14, 1993, Bangkok, Thailand.</page><page sequence="2">198 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY In the 1950s Wilhelm G. Solheim II, an archaeologist from the Univer? sity of Arizona, worked on a number of Philippine archaeological sites, primarily jar burial sites, and concentrated his research on the distribution and diffusion of an earthenware pottery tradition. He has an extensive background and experience in the whole of Southeast Asia and was for a time a professor at the University of Hawaii. Solheim has trained a number of well-known Southeast Asian archaeologists, including Karl Hutterer, Don Bayard, Warren Peterson, etc. and the late Chester Gorman. Solheim is now retired from his academic appointment but still active in the field of Southeast Asian prehistoric archaeology. In the 1960s Robert B. Fox, a trained (cultural) anthropologist from the University of Chicago, conducted a number of archaeological investiga? tions in the Philippines until the mid 1970s. His best known archaeological work is The Tabon Caves, covering the period from the paleolithic (50,000-10,000 years ago), neolithic (5,000-890 B.C.), the metal age (800 B.C.-A.D. 900) and the protohistoric period or period of contact and trade (10th century A.D. to 1521). One of the most prominent students and assistants of Beyer, Solheim and Fox was Alfredo E. Evangelista, who received a Master of Arts degree in (cultural) anthropology at the University of Chicago. He then moved into archaeological work with Solheim at the University of Hawaii. Evan? gelista has worked both at the National Museum of the Philippines in Ma? nila and at the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City. He retired as a Director III of the National Museum in September 1992. F. Landa Jocano is a trained cultural anthropologist, who received a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. For a time he was also connected with the National Museum until he transferred to the University of the Philip? pines. Jocano has written a book on Philippine Prehistory (1975) based on the archaeological materials recovered by Fox, mainly from Palawan and some from the rest of the Philippine archipelago. He introduced the use of New World terminologies into Philippine prehistory, using the old data. Another remarkable student of anthropology and archaeology during the time of Fox in the Philippines was Jesus T. Peralta, who received a Ph.D. in (cultural) anthropology at the University of California at Davies in 1976. Peralta was Chief of the Anthropology Division, which for some time was responsible for the growth of archaeology, then a section of that division, until an Archaeology Division was created in 1988. (This will be</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES 199 discussed further in this paper.) Peralta took the place of Evangelista as Director III of the National Museum of the Philippines a short time ago. Most of the archaeological work prior to the 1980s was about culture history, cultural chronology, typology of prehistoric material cultures, us? ing the unilineal development stages of cultural evolutionary theory, such as the paleolithic, neolithic and the metal age periodization. This is also known as the inductive approach to archaeology. Archaeological artifacts are identified, collected and sorted to fit in to the cultural/chronological stage model. These stage models have been very useful in the identifica? tion of various archaeological sites in the Philippines. The bulk of the ar? chaeological research done at that time was mere collection of prehistoric remains for the National Museum. Karl L. Hutterer was an archaeology student of Solheim at the Univer? sity of Hawaii. He received his Ph.D. in 1973 with a dissertation on Basey Archaeology: Prehistoric Trade and Social Evolution in the Philippines. For a while he taught at the University of Michigan and served as curator at the Museum of Anthropology, until he moved to the University of Washington in Seattle and occupied the director's position at the Burkes Museum in 1990. Hutterer has been very influential among a number of new archaeologists working in the Philippines and pursuing the idea of so? cio-economic and political complexity in the prehistoric period. We will come back to some of his students. William A. Longacre, professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona, conducted ethnoarchaeological studies in the Kalinga region in northern Luzon in the late 1970s. In the early 1980s he shifted to ethnoar? chaeological research in Gubat, Sorsogon, southern Luzon. He investi? gated the standardization processes used in the manufacture of earthenware potteries in small-scale production. Longacre has, so far, trained a number of students and has come up with various publications. He is still active in the field of archaeology and has offered to undertake the dating of the Ca latagan Pot with inscription by accelerated C-14 technique.* ?Two publications belonging here but overlooked by the author should be added: Coutts, Peter J.F.

Ed.</page><page sequence="4">200 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Professionalization in the Field of Archaeology Prior to the 1980s, archaeology in the Philippines had been carried out by skilled and trained cultural anthropologists, such as H. Otley Beyer, Robert B. Fox, Wilhelm G. Solheim II, Alfredo E. Evangelista, F. Landa Jocano and Jesus T. Peralta. The works of these scholars became the back? bone of archaeological research in the country. In one way or another, each had an influence on present-day practitioners of archaeology. Formal education is a very important aspect in the field of archaeology in the Philippines. In the 1980s, there were four Filipinos who received scholarships from various foundations. Two were sponsored by the Ford Foundation to study at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, the other two were sponsored by the Fulbright-Hays Foundation (locally known now as the Philippine American Educational Foundation or PAEF): one scholar going to the University of New York at Buffalo and the other, to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. In 1982, Wilfredo P. Ronquillo earned his Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in anthropology, major in archaeology, at the University of Penn? sylvania, under the Ford Foundation scholarship grant program on the pre? history of Southeast Asia. His major archaeological contribution is The Technological and Functional Analyses of the Lithic Flake Tools From Rabe I Cave, Cagayan Valley in the Northern Luzon, Philippines (1981). Under the same Ford Foundation Southeast Asian scholarship pro? gram, Eusebio Z. Dizon, the author of this survey, earned his M.Sc. degree in 1983 at the Department of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, with his research on the Metal Age in the Philippines: An Archaeometal lurgical Investigation (1983). He continued to attain a Ph.D. degree in an? thropology, major in archaeology, in 1988 at the same university, with a dissertation on the Iron Age period in Philippines (1988). Both Ronquillo and Dizon are active in the field of archaeology and are currently assigned to the Archaeology Division, National Museum in Philippines. Ronquillo is currently the Chief (Curator II) of the new Ar? chaeology Division of the National Museum of the Philippines, while Di? zon is assistant curator (Curator I) in the Archaeology Division and head of the Underwater Archaeology Section. Another scholar, Florante Henson, received a Master of Arts degree in anthropology at the University of the Philippines in 1978 with his</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES 201 archaeological research report on the Flake Tool Industry at Laurente Cave in Cagayan Valley, Philippines (1978). He used to work with the Anthropology Division of the National Museum of the Philippines; later, on a study leave, he obtained his Ph.D. degree in anthropology, major in archaeology, at the University of New York at Buffalo in 1983, through a scholarship grant from the Fullbright-Hays Foundation. His dissertation is Locational Study of Prehistoric Island Settlements in Central Philippines (1983). Unfortunately, Henson left the National Museum in 1990. In 1992, the Philippine Civil Service Commission has for the first time recognized the field of archaeology as a scientific career in government service. Formal applications were sent to this agency by Peralta, Ronquillo and Dizon and as a result, they were conferred the government eligibility as professional archaeologists in the country. This government eligibility will now become standard for conducting both archaeological research and assessment related projects in the Philippines. Archaeological surveys and assessments for any development projects, such as roads, airports, power plants and even fish port complex projects are now required under Philip? pine Law. The Michigan School As mentioned earlier, Karl L. Hutterer, who used to be at the Univer? sity of Michigan, was able to train a number of students, and the following have made contributions to the development of archaeology in the Philip? pines. In 1982, Hutterer and Macdonald edited and published the results of their regional approach in the study of Philippine prehistory. Another student of archaeology, Maria Lorenza Dalupan, received a M.A. at the Ateneo de Manila University in 1981, with her work on the Prehistoric Occupation of Lattuc-lattuc Cave in Cagayan Valley Concen? trating on the Evidence of Ceramics. In 1982, she received a Fullbright Hays scholarship and spent some years at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, working on the development of Philippine complex societies. Dalupan had begun to evaluate and re-check the Santa Ana, Manila ar? chaeological data when her studies were interrupted by her involvement in socio-political affairs of the nation since 1988 to date. Laura L. Junker has been a long time student of Hutterer at the Univer? sity of Michigan, although she did some graduate studies at the University</page><page sequence="6">202 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY of Pennsylvania for her M.A. (1984). Going back to the University of Michigan she received her Ph.D. in 1990. She carried on her dissertation research in the Tanjay area, on the eastern coast of Negros Oriental, as an offshoot of Hutterer's long-range interdisciplinary program, which was primarily concerned with the prehistoric social and cultural development. Her dissertation is entitled Long-Distance Trade and the Development of Socio-Political Complexity in Philippine Chiefdom of the First Millenium A.D., in 3 volumes. Junker is now a professor in Vanderbilt University at Nashville and will be pursuing further archaeological research on the de? velopment of complex societies in the Philippines with the National Mu? seum. She has been a great help to the Archaeology Division ever since her return in 1992. Masao Nishimura, another student of Hutterer, has conducted archae? ological research in Cebu, again on the problem of complex societies. He received his Ph.D. in 1992 with a dissertation entitled Long Distance Trade and the Development of Complex Societies in the Prehistory of the Central Philippines: The Cebu Central Settlement Case, written in 3 vol? umes. Nishimura is now a professor in the School of Education in Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan. The Michigan School is the leader in a "New" Archaeology or anthro? pological archaeology type of research in the Philippines, focussing pri? marily on the problem of complexity and chiefdom. These archaeological researches employ a mainly deductive method in which hypotheses are first explicitly stated before the actual field investigation. Mainly mathe? matical and/or statistical models are used to interpret the archaeological evidence. The Newly Formed Archaeology Division (1988) One of the major events in the history of archaeology in the Philippines is the creation of the newly organized Archaeology Division at the Na? tional Museum of the Philippines in April of 1988. As mentioned earlier, prior to this event, archaeological researches in the country had been car? ried out by the Anthropology Division, National Museum. The newly es? tablished Archaeology Division is currently headed by Wilfredo P. Ronquillo. Archaeological projects both on land and underwater have greatly multiplied, as is made evident and reflected in the number of both</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES 203 published and unpublished archaeological reports deposited in the Archae? ology Division's Record Section. One need only look at the National Mu? seum 's Annual Reports in order to see the progress in the Archaeology Division. The following are the highlights of current archaeological activi? ties in the Philippines: In September 1989, a Maritime Gallery was opened at the National Museum exhibiting the history of maritime technology and culture in the Philippines, with its centerpiece, the Butuan Boat 2, dated 1250 A.D. The gallery exhibits also some underwater archaeological artifacts recovered from the Griffin shipwreck of 1761 northwest of Basilan Island. The ex? hibit has benefited the general public by its contribution to the culture his? tory and heritage of the Philippine archipelago. Site Coverage The sites covered by the Archaeology Division, National Museum of the Philippines include both land and underwater exploration. Land ar? chaeology covers cave sites on rolling hills and mountains, as well as open sites from the prehistoric period up to the historical period, post 1521 up to the 19th century A.D. Underwater sites are those found in the territorial waters of the Philippine archipelago, including rivers and lakes. Table 1 is a summary of the number of archaeological sites recorded between 1982 and 1992. Table 1.

The project was a cooperative venture between the Archaeology Division and the Centre for Southeast Asian Re? search under the direction of Dr. Peter Burns of the University of Adelaide (Australia). In 1989 a systematic exploration along the coastal area of the province of Zambales was conducted (Dizon and Aguilera 1990). In order to continue with the search for Thai ceramics as well as other tradewares, and to look at the pattern of distribution of these materials at the Mangga han Sites, San Marcelino, Zambales, an archaeological field school was conducted in 1991 just before the major eruption of Mt. Pinatubo Volcano, in coordination with the University of the Philippines, Diliman Campus, Quezon City. The project was terminated due to the eruption of Pinatubo. Butuan Archaeological Project As noted by Ronquillo (1985:83), "One of the most significant events ever to occur in Philippine archaeology was the recovery of two ancient Philippine boats from Butuan, Agusan del Norte, on the island of Min? danao." More systematic excavations have been carried out in the sur? rounding areas near the 12 boats detected, delineating probable site boundaries. Furthermore, the other side of the Agusan River, particularly the area of Magallanes, was also tested for its archaeological potentials (Bautista 1991). Archaeological sites were located in Barangay Taod-oy, Magallanes, Agusan del Norte, designated as the Pabatan Property. In the open area in Pabatan's Property, a 4 x 4 m square was excavated and yielded a total of 376 pieces of archaeological materials and ecofacts. Several pieces of earthenware sherds were recovered at the depth of 115 cm from the local datum plane and the disintegrated wooden cover of a coffin was noted at 160 cm from the datum plane. Human bones and teeth were also recovered. The analysis showed that these bones belonged to one individual. A dug-out wooden coffin was exposed below the human bones. Associated with the coffin was a small dug-out box. Three earthenware vessels in two sizes were also found on the north, west and south sides of the coffin. The largest vessel has a diameter of 16 cm while the other two have a diameter of 9 cm. The earthenware vessels were brittle and broken</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES 205 when retrieved. Three stakes with an average length of 60 cm were found in situ below the coffin and traces of mat were also found at the base of the coffin. This project will provide important information on the prehistory of the area, especially on the dug-out wooden coffin burial practices in Agusan del Norte. Surigao Archaeological Project The Surigao Archaeological Project in Barangay Panhutongan, Placer, Surigao del Norte was conceived by the Philippine Social Science Council, Inc. (PSSC), the Surigaonon Heritage Foundation and the Archaeology Di? vision, National Museum. After a preliminary archaeological excavation of the site in October 1991 an extensive systematic excavation at the Panhutongan Elementary School compound was conducted from April 15 to May 30, 1992, by a team headed by Eusebio Z. Dizon, Curator I of the Archaeology Division and Leslie E. Bauzon, Chairman of the Governing Council of PSSC, Pro? fessor of History at the University of the Philippines. The project was made possible by the financial support from the Toyota Foundation, the National Science Research Council (NRCP), the Daiwa Bank and the Presidential Commission on Culture and the Arts (PCCA). There were 28 squares excavated with a total area of 359 square me? ters, to an average depth of .512 meters with 183.8 cubic meters of soil re? moved. Materials exposed and retrieved were tradeware ceramic sherds, earth? enware sherds both plain and decorated, iron slags, dug-out wooden coffin, wooden posts, stone structure, glass beads of Chinese and Dutch origin, clay pipes, metal implements and contemporary materials, such as mar? bles, plastic, tile fragments and coins. The stone structure exposed enclosed a total land area of approxi? mately 359 square meters. Five dug-out wooden coffins were exposed and found associated with human skeletal remains and metal implements. An open-pit burial was un? earthed in association with a Chinese (Ming) porcelain bowl attributed to the 16th-17th centuries A.D. and faceted glass beads dated 1650 to 1730 A.D. of Dutch origin.</page><page sequence="10">206 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Panhutongan Site is considered a multicomponent site based on the materials collected and significant features unearthed. Archaeological Exploration in Amoslog and Vicinities During the field season April-May 1992, an archaeological exploration was undertaken in Panhutongan and Amoslog areas and the river system connecting Barangays Pananay-an, Hinatigan, Panhutongan and Tagbon gabong in order to assess and map areas or landforms which could be rele? vant to the reconstruction of the past physical environmental setting of the project area. Towards the western section of Barangay Amoslog is a limestone for? mation. The formation's physiography is characterized by karst topogra? phy with elevations ranging from 132 meters to 318 meters above mean sea level. The limestone formation which covers Barangays Amoslog and Tagbongabong is of the Miocene period. The caves and a rocksheiter that were covered by the archaeological survey are located in the limestone formation approximately one kilometer west of Barangay Amoslog proper. It yielded a positive result. Kandingan Cave in Barangay Amoslog is considered a very significant archaeological site as evidenced by the cultural materials recovered, such as a shell mid? den deposit in association with animal bone fragments, earthenware sherds with complex designs, tradeware ceramics, shells (marine and brackish), stone implements, and human skeletal remains. The cultural relationship of these artifacts must be established through systematic excavations of the Kandingan Cave. It is only through the sys? tematic recovery of the archaeological materials that the depositional his? tory of the shell midden site in Kandingan Cave can be fully understood. Identification of shells from a marine and brackish-estuarine environment as well as the identification of the animal bone fragments will determine the cultural activities of the cave dwellers. The geomorphological study of the Amoslog area is highly recommended in order to determine its past physical environmental setting. Aerial-photo interpretation as well as an actual geomorphological survey will help in the interpretation of the poten? tials of the surrounding landforms.</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES 207 South Cotabato Archaeological Excavations Two archaeological excavations undertaken in Ayub Cave in Pinol, Maitum, South Cotabato yielded a total of 33 baskets of earthenware burial jars and anthropomorphic pottery covers. The excavations were done from November 6 to December 15, 1991 and from April 8 to May 4 of 1992. The project has been carried out with the financial support of private indi? viduals. Eusebio Z. Dizon, who headed the project, described the finds as char? acteristically of the Metal Age period in the Philippines between 300 B.C. and 500 A.D. The anthropomorphic materials were apparently used as lids or covers for secondary burials. However, this date range was only an esti? mate. It was pointed out that it is necessary to date the artifacts themselves and their associated materials by absolute dating techniques, such as Carb? on 14 and C-14 Accelerator tests as well as the thermoluminescence tech? nique for the potteries. The team discovered 29 pieces of secondary burial jars complete with heads which show minor damages. Two hundred heads have already been taken from the baskets, and many are still restorable. There are also other types of secondary burial jar lids like the "trunconical with adze-shape and round spinning-shape motifs." The head covers exhibit various facial ex? pressions, from smiling to crying, which are evidently the product of their own local artists and potters from hundreds of generations past. One burial jar with an anthropomorphic lid or head cover has a total height of 70 cm. These findings might serve as the backbone of our own Filipino culture since our Southeast Asian neighbors have nothing of this type of archae? ological finds. It was further stressed that we have never seen such a mag? nificent archaeological assemblage before. The second phase of the excavation ended on May 4, 1992, and the team looks forward to the completion of the project as soon as proper funding is available. Balobok Rocksheiter Archaeological Re-excavation The presence of archaeological materials in Balobok Rocksheiter had been reported by Eric Casino, a cultural anthropologist of the National Museum, in 1966 and the first archaeological excavation took place as</page><page sequence="12">208 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY early as 1967. The site was also partially excavated by Alexander Spoehr, a cultural anthropologist from the University of Pittsburgh, and Israel Cabanilla, the latter a former researcher of the National Museum. The site yielded shell adzes taken from Tridacna sp. Similar artifacts were found in Duyong Cave in Palawan, Okinawa, Japan and some islands in the Pacific. The re-excavation of the site was conducted from August 24 to Sep? tember 30, 1992 after the Archaeology Division obtained financial aid from Shijun Asato of the Historiographie Institute of Okinawa Prefectural Library. A team, led by Wilfredo P. Ronquillo, Curator II, set out to con? duct a controlled systematic excavation of the site with another Japanese archaeologist and National Museum honorary researcher, Kazuhiku Tanaka. The month-long project generated significant data crucial to Philip? pines as well as Pacific and southern Japan history. Shell adzes made from giant marine clams {Tridacna gigas), flake tools made from petrified wood and volcanic rocks were found to have been persistently used from the Pa? leolithic Age until the Metal Age, a bronze axe and earthenware potteries were among the important finds recovered from the rocksheiter. The shell midden was found to consist mostly of clams and sea shells. The State of Underwater Archaeology Underwater archaeology in the Philippines is moving from mere explo? ration work to full scale excavations with the cooperation of various inter? national private institutions. Dizon has presented a number of papers on the development of underwater archaeology in the Philippines until 1992. One of these is The Status of Underwater Archaeological Researches in the Philippines, 1989-1991, which was reported and published at the Aus? tralian Institute for Maritime Archaeology. Another report on underwater archaeological activities in the Philippines from 1991 to mid 1992 was presented at the SEAMEO Scholarship Award for Participation in the SPAFA Consultative Workshop on Underwater Archaeological Research (S-W141), held in Serang, Banten, Indonesia, from 29 June to 5 July 1992. Underwater Archaeology at Puerto Galera A series of periodic visits by the scuba divers from the Underwater</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES 209 Archaeology Section have been done in Sabang, Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro. The objective of the visits is to maintain the keel of the Spanish galleon De La Vida and at the same time, to conduct orientation dives es? pecially by the new divers of the Division. In 1990, the De La Vida keel was excavated from the reefs of Isla Verde. It was brought to Boquete Island in Puerto Galera for conservation and eventual exhibit at the Puerto Galera Museum. But the conservation or desalination phase of the project was not a success. The deterioration of the wooden keel was fast and it prompted the underwater team to place the keel in water in order to prevent its further deterioration. After finding an ideal location for this purpose, the keel was laid on a sandy seabed at a depth of 5-7 m from the surface and about 50 m from the beach. Brian Homan and his diving staff at Captain Gregg's in Sabang, Puerto Galera checked the condition of the material in the absence of Un? derwater Archaeology personnel. In April 1991, a team from the Underwater Archaeology Section and from the Ministry of Culture of France based in Marseilles, headed by Michel L'Hour, revisited the site. Orientation dives were likewise con? ducted and the last visit was undertaken from December 7-10, 1992 by a team of divers led by Eusebio Dizon. San Diego Underwater Archaeological Project The San Diego Underwater Archaeological Project was undertaken by the Underwater Section of the Archaeology Division with the cooperation of the World Wide First, Inc., a French outfit under the leadership of Franck Goddio, in the waters off Fortune Island, Batangas. This activity was undertaken on the basis of intensive archival research and the explora? tions and survey done in the area where the Spanish warship San Diego sunk in 14 December 1600 under the command of Don Juan Antonio de Morga, a judge at the Spanish Royal Audiencia in Manila at that time. The San Diego was sunk by the Mauritius, a Dutch ship under the command of Oliver van Noord. In the first quarter of 1991, scientific underwater ar? chaeological exploration was carried out off Fortune Island with the aid of proton magnetometer survey equipment and the Global Positioning Sys? tem (GPS), when "anomalies" were detected at the site. Systematic underwater excavation was carried out from February 7 to</page><page sequence="14">210 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY April 29, 1992, at the depth of 50 meters below the water surface. The team recovered major finds from the area like porcelain wares, stonewares, earthenwares, musketballs and cannonballs, metal navigational instru? ments, weaponries, silver coins, animal and human remains and seeds. These materials are now undergoing treatment for conservation by the Conservation Section of the Physical and Chemical Laboratory of the Na? tional Museum. The culmination of this activity was to be the final documentation of the wooden remains of the warship scheduled to be undertaken in Summer of 1993. Other Activities of the Archaeology Division The following are other activities of the Archaeology Division, in con? nection with the goals of the National Museum and requirements of the government of the Philippines. In many ways, these activities, particularly archaeological surveys and assessment projects, are beneficial to everyone involved. Development projects in the Philippines are made safe against archaeological damages, while the Archaeology Division, National Mu? seum gains a great deal of information from all the various areas of the Philippines which are not yet normally covered in general plans and pro? grams of the division due to lack of the necessary means. In addition, the division can input the coverage areas of archaeological reconnaissance sur? vey in their database, whether the result is positive or negative of archae? ological materials. Archaeological Survey and Assessment Projects The archaeological component of EIS (Environmental Impact State? ment) is extremely important since archaeological resources - which con? sist of the physical remains of past human activity - may be of provincial, regional, national or international significance. Since the late 1980s, the Archaeology Division has been very active in conducting archaeological impact assessments throughout the country, in coordination with various government and non-government organizations. These various archae? ological assessment projects are conducted both on land and under water.</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES 211 A management objective manual on archaeological assessment was written by Ronquillo and Dizon (1990). Archaeological sites are valuable national resources like mineral de? posits, arable lands, forests, fish and wildlife. In addition to their scientific and public value, archaeological sites may also have economic value to the country's recreation and tourism industries. Archaeological impact assessments are initiated in response to pro? posed development projects which will disturb or alter the landscape, thereby potentially destroying archaeological sites. Small-scale developments, such as road and airport constructions, power plant projects, dam building, residential subdivisions, and oil and gas exploration, are often directly referred to the National Museum by ap? proving officers for agencies such as the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Bureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences and the Department of Energy. The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), of which archaeological assessment is an important aspect, is a requirement imposed by the Envi? ronmental Management Bureau (EMB) of the Department of Natural Re? sources (DENR) to the project proponents conforming to the Philippine Environmental Regulations and Procedures as prescribed under Presiden? tial Decree No. 1586 before the issuance of an Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC). Archaeological Assessment Projects in Intramuros, Manila An archaeological assessment of archaeological sites within the his? toric walls of Intramuros, Manila has been conducted since March 1992. The project is in collaboration with the Intramuros Administration. The objectives of the excavation are to expose the Spanish colonial structures and to provide recommendations on the proposed infrastructure develop? ment in five historical sites within Intramuros walls. The Archaeological Assessment Project has been proposed by the Na? tional Museum to the Intramuros Administration in order to guide develop? ers in their planning stages of constructions of infrastructures or development of a cultural resource such as archaeological or historical sites within Intramuros walls.</page><page sequence="16">212 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Photo File The Photo File of the Archaeology Division was created to maintain the photo collection of the Division. This includes the black and white negatives and prints and colored slides of artifacts and archaeological sites in the different places of the country. The section sorted, inventoried and catalogued color slides for the fol? lowing: 1) Terrestrial Archaeology.3,240 pcs. 2) Zooarchaeology. 372 pcs. 3) Underwater Archaeology.1T294 pcs. 4,906 pcs. The colored slides have been sorted, identified, classified and recorded in a card catalogue for the purpose of easy access and retrieval. The card catalogue will be mainly classified according to subject and further subdi? vided into regions and provinces. Basic informations were also recorded for each group of slides, such as region, province, year, number of pieces, site name, photo file code, pho? tographer, storage location, classification like land, zooarchaeology or un? derwater and general description. These informations were encoded using the DBase IV program. It was used as a word processor for easy printing and for sorting the card catalogues according to subject, region and prov? ince. Computerization of Archaeological Data Bank The computerization of the archaeological data is an on-going project of the Archaeology Records Section. It was started in 1991 by Amalia de la Torre and Nida T. Cuevas, both Museum Researchers of the Archaeol? ogy Division. The objective of this project is to facilitate access to the re? cords and data files of the Division. All field reports submitted by the Archaeology Division personnel since 1956 were listed/catalogued and en? coded with the use of Bibliography Management Program Version 3.62 and a compiled bibliography has been produced labeled Masterlist I: Ar chaeological Field Reports Index.</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES 213 The field reports were summarized and encoded using the DBase IV Program. The informations encoded are: - Region - Site Name - Locality - Province - Latitude - Longitude - Accession Number or Site Code - Date or Chronological Period - Method used by the researcher - Collectors or personnel involved - Characteristics or the type of site - Artifacts collected - Brief description of the project - References A compiled summary had been produced called Vol. I: Summary of Ar chaeological Field Reports. A total of 1,343 archaeological sites found in the Philippines from 1949-1991 have been listed and encoded using the DBase IV Program. The sites were listed according to region (in alphabetical order). A compi? lation of archaeological sites from 1949-1991 was made in December 1992. In addition, there were 200 field reports summarized and 615 reports indexed for easy retrieval. Archaeological Evidences of Animals as Trade Goods This project, being undertaken by Elenita Alba, Museum Researcher II of the Archaeology Division, is under the UNESCO's Hirayama Silk Roads Fellowship Program. Preliminary survey and gathering of information for the project were done during visits to the different museums and archaeological sites in Thailand. Some of the places visited were the Northern Provinces of Nan, Sukothai, Si Satchanalai and Ayutthaya; the Northeast Provinces of Phi Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima, Surin, Buriram; and the Southern Provinces of Songkla and Nakhorn Si Thammarrat. A survey of the related literature was done after gathering and selecting the materials for the study.</page><page sequence="18">214 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY The first phase of the study was a library research of the historical ac? counts and sorting of specimens for study. Comparative data and relevant informations were gathered through interviews with archaeologists and re? searchers from the different countries of Southeast Asia; visits to muse? ums, storage areas and archaeological sites; and selection and docu? mentation of specimens. Analysis of mammal bones was started in July and August and was re? sumed in November-December, 1992. Preliminary analyses of specimens from the Sta. Ana sites and Balanghai sites revealed a high probability of the mammalian species to have been introduced in the Philippines by means of maritime trading, directly or indirectly. Some of the species are Bovini species such as carabao or cow (either Bnbahis bubalis or Bos tau rus or both) Eqiius caballus (horse); Caprini species (goat or sheep); Felis catus (domesticated cat); and Canis familiaris (dog). Historical accounts support the assumption that these animals were be? ing used in the trading system in prehistoric times and even after the 16th century A.D. It was hoped that the first draft of the research paper would be finished by April, 1993 after all the data have been collated and prop? erly analyzed. Notable Popular Publications In 1989, the National Museum Papers, a scientific journal, was launched covering mainly archaeological and anthropological topics as well as areas in the natural and physical sciences. Issues are coming out bi annually. One of the latest topics published in the latest issue is the study of an anthropomorphic formula of the Filipino population which can be compared to archaeological human skeletal samples. The Oriental Ceramics Society of the Philippines, a private organiza? tion of ceramic collectors, has now been in cooperation with the National Museum in coming up with occasional public exhibitions of ceramics both of their members' collections as well as National Museum pieces which have been most of the time safeguarded at the Collection Holdings Section (formerly storage section) and not shown to the public. The society has come up with publications, which are quite beautiful and very informa? tive although expensive. One is on Chinese and Southeast Asian Green ware found in the Philippines (1991) and the other was organized by the</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES 215 Jars Collectors entitled A Thousand Years of Stoneware Jars in the Philip? pines (1992). Two important catalogues were published regarding underwater ar? chaeological activities and artifacts recovered from a 16th century Chinese (Ming) wrecksite in Palawan and another from an 18th century British (Griffin) wrecksite in the Basilan area, which were produced by the Under? water Archaeology Section in coordination with the World Wide First in the mid-1980s. Problems, Discussion, and Conclusion The major problem that archaeology currently faces is the lack of schools or universities formally offering courses in archaeology in the Philippines. Although there have been some students who wanted to pur? sue archaeology as their major, the problem is there are no available quali? fied faculty members to teach it even at the University of the Philippines. It was pointed out that the kind of archaeological work before the 1980s was inductive, primarily oriented to the collection of archaeological material remains. Aside from the objective of reconstructing cultural chro? nology for the entire Philippine archipelago in order to look at cultural and technological developments, archaeology must also provide the National Museum with desirable and attractive artifacts. It is the objective of the National Museum to exhibit the cultural heritage of the Philippines, and these are the majority of archaeological materials recovered and collected. On the other hand, for the deductive approach, it does not matter what kind of artifacts are collected, and the objective is to provide material evi? dence which is statistically testable for the kind of archaeological problems it poses. It can be observed that this kind of approach is undertaken by aca? demic institutions and universities who do not have the pressure of collect? ing for their museums. Besides, it has become the practice to leave all archaeological collections with the host countries unless a kind of sharing has been agreed upon. The trend in the newly established Archaeology Division to date is to combine both the inductive and the deductive approach in order to accom? modate both the National Museum objectives and theoretical issues in Philippine and Southeast Asian prehistory and archaeology as well as history. This is evident with the new findings and activities of the</page><page sequence="20">216 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Archaeology Division. The inductive approach will allow the archaeolo? gists to collect sufficient data as material evidences to support hypotheses being posed for theoretical considerations. In the end, we envision substan? tial archaeological data with statistical significance that will substantiate realistic interpretations of Philippine prehistoric culture as well as evolu? tionary theories.
