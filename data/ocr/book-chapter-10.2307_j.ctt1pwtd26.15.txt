<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 8 Traditions of Jars as Mortuary  Containers in the Indo-Malaysian  Archipelago David Bulbeck Earthenware and imported ceramic jars were from time to time used as mortuary containers across  a large swathe of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago. As noted by Peter Bellwood, this deployment of  earthenwares has Neolithic origins, and burgeoned during approximately the first millennium AD.  The assemblages were frequently dominated by disposals in mortuary jars but these were one of a  variety of mortuary practices at other sites. Defining a jar-burial tradition as a potentially independent  development of the use of jars as mortuary containers, we may provisionally identify 14 geographically  discrete jar-burial traditions within the archipelago. Introduction In his textbook on the prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago, Peter Bellwood (1997) dealt  at length with the use of jars as mortuary containers, which he assigned to a tradition best regarded  ‘as an indigenous development in Island Southeast Asia’ (p. 306). He traced the tradition’s origins  to late Neolithic contexts, noting, however, that many more sites date to the Palaeometallic or  Early Metal Phase. He also stated that the recorded sites appeared to be particularly a feature of  the triangular area in between the Philippines, Borneo and Sumba (p. 296). Implicitly, Bellwood  referred to the use of jars not as grave goods but as mortuary containers, even if this specific  use of the recovered pottery is inferred rather than directly observed at certain sites, such as  Leang Buidane (see below). The examples he discussed also exclude sites with jars buried for  rituals that were probably non-mortuary, considering the lack of associated human remains in  conditions that should be conducive to preservation of bone – for instance, the Palaeometallic  jars buried at Makabog in the Philippines (Henson 1992), Leang Balangingi in the Talaud Islands  (Bellwood 1976) and Batu Ejaya in southwest Sulawesi (Bulbeck 1996–1997). In this review of the sites covered by Bellwood (1997) as well as more recently documented sites,  I shall summarise the evidence in broad support of Bellwood’s chronology. However, the area  with a concentrated use of jars as mortuary containers can now be revised as the trapezoidal belt  of islands from the Philippines in the north to southern Sumatra in the southwest and Sumba  and the Moluccas in the southeast (Figure 8.1). In addition, I shall propose that the mourners’  choice of jars rather than some other container, or indeed the disposal of container-free mortuary  remains, cannot be related in any simple way to socioeconomic factors or reconstructible  belief systems. </page> <page sequence="2"> 142    New Perspectives in Southeast Asian and Pacific Prehistory Figure 8.1 Sites in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago with jars used as mortuary containers. Source: Compiled and drawn by D. Bulbeck. On the question of whether jar burials in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago should be assigned to  a single (Bellwood 1997) or multiple traditions (Lloyd-Smith and Cole 2010), we should first  define the term ‘tradition’. According to Fagan (1994: 420), the term implies cultural continuity  of the subject of the tradition (such as an artefact type) over lengthy periods of time by cultures  that may vary in other ways. Valentin et al. (2015) interpret the concept of a single Indo- Malaysian jar-burial tradition to mean a single shared belief system on issues related to handling  the deceased. However, in terms of Fagan’s definition, all that would be required is continuity of  jar burials as a practice tracing back to its original source. This source would be Neolithic Taiwan,  where jar burials date back to at least 1000 cal. BC; and its transmission to Indo-Malaysia would  have been undertaken by the southward expansion of early Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian)  speakers, according to Valentin et al. (2015) as well as Bellwood (as reported by Cuevas and de  Leon 2008: 19). Thus, despite their explicit support for multiple traditions in Indo-Malaysia,  and a separate but related tradition at Teouma in Vanuatu, Valentin et al. (2015) actually endorse  a single tradition. This may also be the same tradition that resulted in jar burials postdating  Teouma (and mostly dating to the second millennium AD) in various other Pacific Islands where  Austronesian languages were spoken ethnographically or the inhabitants were in contact with  Austronesian speakers (Bedford and Spriggs 2007). terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="3"> 8.  Traditions of Jars as Mortuary Containers in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago    143  Instead, the touchstone for recognising multiple traditions would be to show that one or more  independent developments of the practice of jar burials is a more reasonable scenario than  continuity of the original practice. In addition, if multiple independent developments of jar  burials appears likely, then geographical proximity of sites with a similar range of jar-burial  practices would provide the empirical grounds to be confident in assigning these sites to a single  tradition. On that basis, as detailed below, 14 traditions could be posited to cover the diversity  documented across the archipelago. The concept of ‘horizon’, which may be used to ‘link a number of phases in neighboring areas that  have rather general cultural patterns in common’ (Fagan 1994: 420), is also useful for reviewing  the archaeological evidence. A horizon could mark the appearance of a new jar-burial tradition(s)  or it could signify the shared transformation of previously established jar-burial traditions. The broad chronological scheme for Indo-Malaysian prehistory outlined by Bellwood (1997)  is employed here, with the Neolithic (defined by the appearance of pottery and polished stone  tools) dating to between ca. 2000 and 200 cal. BC, and the Palaeometallic to approximately the  first millennium AD. The latter largely corresponds to the early appearance of metals and exotic  items of glass and semi-precious stone, but the date of their earliest appearance varied across the  archipelago. Accordingly, their absence from an assemblage is no guarantee that the assemblage  predates 200 BC, particularly if it is not large. Neolithic foundations  Niah Caves The oldest intact jar burials in the archipelago were excavated in the Neolithic cemeteries at the  Niah Caves, predominantly the West Mouth but also several from the smaller Lobang Jeragan  cemetery (Table 8.1). The term ‘Neolithic’ is qualified by the occurrence of three small bronze  items amongst the sparse assemblage of grave goods, two inside jar burials and the third found  with an extended burial. Dating all three bronzes to earlier than 500 cal. BC – making them  the archipelago’s oldest dated bronzes – is conservative in view of the 1500–1414 cal. BC and  812–559 cal. BC determinations on the two dated burials with bronze (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2013).  Moreover, the appearance of bronze – undocumented for Taiwan sites of this antiquity (Valentin  et al. 2015) – raises a legitimate question of whether the source for the Niah jar burials should be  traced to Mainland Southeast Asia, where sites such as Ban Non Wat, Ban Lum Khao and Nong  Nor included jar burials by the second millennium BC and bronze by the end of the millennium  (Bulbeck 2011; Higham 2011). All of the Niah burial jars were at least partially interred, with full burial noted for three of  the 12 West Mouth examples (Lloyd-Smith and Cole 2010). The Niah Caves jar burials are  notable for their sparse occurrence (some 5–10 per cent of burials) over a long period of time  between ca. 1150 and 300 cal. BC (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2013). They are remarkable for their  diversity in terms of the nature of the jars used as containers, the treatment of the bone (variably  cremated and/or haematite-stained), the interred individuals’ demographics and whether single  or multiple burials were interred (Table 8.1). Their sparseness and diversity suggest a recurrent  practice ‘reinstantiated’ to meet particular ritual needs, with the use of the jars – rather than one  of the other Niah burial modes (Table 8.2) – as a marker of attained wealth and social status  (Lloyd-Smith and Cole 2010). Significantly, another Niah cemetery, Gan Kira, had no jar burials  for either its Neolithic or its Palaeometallic stage (Szabó et al. 2013). terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="4"> 144    New Perspectives in Southeast Asian and Pacific Prehistory terra australis 45 Table 8.1 Published jar burials from the Niah Caves.

Their coverage presented here should be considered in the context of the  Neolithic and Palaeometallic Philippine burials that did not involve mortuary jars, including  Callao Cave (Mijares 2005) and some of the Lal-lo shell middens (Ogawa 2004) in Luzon, and  Sa’gung (Kress 2004), Ille Cave (Szabó et al. 2004) and Leta Leta (Szabó and Ramirez 2009) in  Palawan.

The antiquity of jar burials in the Philippines may reach back to the beginnings of the Neolithic,  if Mijares (2005) is correct in his interpretation of Dalan Serkot as a cave for the secondary  burial of the deceased in mortuary jars, dated to the early second millennium BC (Table 8.3).  Arku Cave, near Dalan Serkot, produced a rich, late Neolithic mortuary assemblage dated to  approximately 1300–1 cal. BC (Spriggs 1989), with grave goods that included jewellery of  terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="7"> 8.  Traditions of Jars as Mortuary Containers in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago    147  shell, fired clay, nephrite and other stone, as well as polished stone adzes, bone points, tattooing  chisels of horn and clay spindle whorls (Thiel 1986–1987). About one-ninth of the represented  individuals can be clearly identified as jar burials, distinguished from the other burials by the  modest quality of the grave goods (Tables 8.2 and 8.3). Jar burials at Arku Cave, then, would  appear to have been reserved for a residue of individuals of low socioeconomic status, unless the  act of burial within a jar signified an elevated status in itself.  Fox (1970; Winters 1974) nominated the term ‘Tabon Jar Burial Complex’ for the 29 Palawan  sites with mortuary ceramics near Tabon Cave. The jars had been placed on or within the cave  surfaces, which rules out dating the jars with samples from cave deposits except where the cave  had no other documented utilisation. There are three such dates, on charcoal, which together  indicate pre-metallic mortuary disposals in Manunggul Chamber A during the first half of the  first millennium BC, and Palaeometallic mortuary disposals in Manunggul Chamber B during  the last centuries BC (Table 8.3). Winters identified a minimum of 14–19 individuals from the  human remains in the 20–30 burial jars at Duyong Cave, and 16 individuals from the Uyaw  Cave human remains. His analysis confirms Fox’s inference that the Tabon complex mortuary  jars generally contained single individuals, including infants and one apparent primary child  burial. Fox also noted that the human remains were sometimes painted with haematite, and  that the jars sometimes contained just the skull or, in one case, the teeth of multiple individuals.  The majority but not all of mortuary disposals were placed inside jars (Table 8.2). Palaeometallic mortuary-jar container sites (ca. 200 BC to  AD 1200) Most Palaeometallic jar-burial sites have been assigned to this period based on the nature of  their grave goods, but in some cases the assignment relies on radiometric dating. For instance,  on Sabtang Island at the far north of the Philippines, Bellwood and Dizon (2013a) uncovered a  cluster of 14 large jars dating to the early centuries AD, but lacking any grave goods (Table 8.3).  A similar antiquity may apply to the large jar burials excavated on nearby Batan Island, although  the fact these jars were looted might suggest the original presence of grave goods (Solheim 1960).  Also, the Bato Caves in Luzon produced 18 jar burials associated with Neolithic grave goods and  no trace of metals (Fox and Evangelista 1957a), despite their dating to around the time of Christ  based on the only associated radiocarbon date (Table 8.3). Of possibly similar age is the ‘Neolithic’ pottery with ‘Kalanay’-style painted and incised  decorations at Asin Cave, southeastern Mindanao, suspected to date before Christ. Solheim et  al. (1979) estimated the burial of about 20 large jars holding the skull and other human bones,  probably secondarily disposed, in association with 80 bowls and small jars, and a stone jar cover.  Similar stone covers are reported for the jar burials from Kanlagkit, San Narciso, Recudo and  Tumagudtad, Luzon (Paz et al. 2013) and the burial jars containing juveniles at the open site  of Igid, Samar (Henson 1992). The Igid extended burials and the Recudo and Tumagudtad jar  burials were associated with iron implements and other Palaeometallic grave goods.  Other Philippine jar-burial sites with glass and/or metal grave goods include most of the secondary  jar-burial sites on Cagraray Island in southern Luzon (Fox and Evangelista 1957b), the Casiguran  and other northwest Sorsogan jar burials from southern Luzon, the 60 jar burials from a mound  on Samar, and the Bacong jar burials on Negros (Henson 1992). At Magsuhot, near Bacong,  two large burial jars containing glass and iron grave goods were excavated, one also holding the  remains of an adult female and two subadults, along with three empty burial jars (Bacus 2004).  The Nagsabaran jar burials in northern Luzon, dated to around 2,000 years ago, are of particular  interest, in that they appear to have held the crania removed from the flexed inhumations in  terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="8"> 148    New Perspectives in Southeast Asian and Pacific Prehistory the same level (Piper et al. 2009). A similar practice of decapitating the corpse, with the skull  sometimes stored inside a jar, appears to have been adopted at the Neolithic cemetery at Teouma  in Vanuatu (Valentin et al. 2015). Also of considerable interest are the large, anthropomorphic burial jars in southern Mindanao,  dated to the first millennium AD at Ayub Cave and at Seminoho Cave (Table 8.3), one of  the numerous such sites (more than 1,000 recorded mortuary jars) on the Kulaman Plateau.  However, not all southern Mindanao jar-burial sites with Palaeometallic burial goods include  anthropomorphic jars, as indicated by their absence from Sagel Cave, which lies near Ayub Cave  (Cuevas and de Leon 2008).  To the south of Mindanao lie the Talaud Islands, where the Leang Buidane rockshelter yielded  mortuary pottery and scattered human remains whose chronology is suspected to span much of  the first millennium AD. Interpretation of the excavated materials as a jar-burial assemblage is  strengthened by the match between the minimum numbers of 36 interred individuals and 32  large jars. The rich assemblage of mortuary goods includes beads and bracelets of shell, semi- precious stone and glass, as well as bronze and iron, and three baked-clay casting moulds, one  with a thermoluminescence date of AD 1000±130 (Bellwood 1976, 1997).  Three jar-burial assemblages of similar nature, age, pottery decorations and associated grave  goods have also been excavated in southeastern Sabah, Borneo (Bellwood 1988a, 1988b, 1988c).  Hagop Bilo yielded fragmentary human remains associated with iron fragments (including one  from a bushknife) and decorated pottery with affinities to the Leang Buidane and Manunggul  A pottery, to a depth of 15 cm. Its estimated antiquity is AD 450–850. Pusu Lumut contained  a 30 cm thick layer with pottery similar to the Hagop Bilo mortuary pottery and was associated  with human fragments and a variety of grave goods, including small stone adzes, pottery- making burnishing stones or anvils, a socketed copper/bronze axe, an axe-casting valve, an  iron spearhead  and two stone or glass beads. The assemblage has a quite wide estimated age  range (AD 450–1450). Pusu Samang Tas also contained a 30 cm thick sedimentary layer with  fragmentary human remains associated with grave goods (five glass beads and two iron knives).  Bellwood (1988c) estimates its age as AD 950–1450 based on the similarity of its mortuary  pottery to Pusu Lumut and also to Pilar in the Visayas. Both Pusu Lumut and Pusu Samang Tas  would overlap in age with the log coffin from the nearby site of Agop Atas, radiocarbon-dated to  around AD 1000 (Bellwood 1988b). Another similar site, according to Bellwood et al. (1998), is the Uattamdi rockshelter  (Kayoa Island, North Moluccas) with jar burials associated with glass beads, iron and bronze  fragments, dated to the first millennium AD. However, Uattamdi differs from the Sabah sites in  that the only skeletal remains associated with its two massive jars are two human crania. Indeed,  Uattamdi evidently combines a previously established tradition of secondary skull burials,  recorded at the nearby site of Tanjung Pinang, with the locally derived ‘invention’ of using the  jars as mortuary containers rather than grave furniture (Bulbeck submitted). Five sites with jar burials, at least four also containing direct interments (Table 8.2), are recorded  for Nusatenggara. Melolo is an extensive urn field with hundreds of large globular jars covered  by a smaller upside-down pot, most containing just a single skull, but others containing skulls  of multiple individuals and/or a few limb bones. The site is renowned for its burnished kendi  flasks with incised human faces, interred as grave goods along with a range of shell ornaments,  stone axes and beads, spindle whorls, glass items and bronze fragments (Van Heekeren 1972;  Bintarti 2000). Bellwood (1997) interprets kendi flasks as a widely distributed Palaeometallic  chronological marker, also recorded at Leang Buidane, Hagop Bilo, as well as Gunung Piring on  Lombok and Liang Bua on Flores (where jar burials have not been documented), and Anyer Lor  in Java (see below). terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="9"> 8.

Pain Haka, in Flores, is a similar site, with six jar  burials including two that only contain adult skulls and others with primary infant burials and  multiple burials, and rare grave goods including shell beads and a small pottery flask (Valentin et  al. 2015). Lewoleba and Waibau, to the northeast, may be similar sites, with fragmentary human  remains inside jars and, in the case of Lewoleba, burial goods that included shell artefacts and  pottery (Bintarti 2000). Southwest Sulawesi, lying to the northwest of Nusatenggara, had highly  variable mortuary practices during the Palaeometallic. These include the burial of numerous teeth  with barely any associated pottery at the Leang Codong rockshelter and the direct interment  of burnt and unburnt human fragments in the Leang-Leang caves of Maros (Bulbeck 1996– 1997). Leang-Leang also has two jar-burial sites, Ulu Leang 2 and Leang Paja, that are similar  to Leang Buidane. The surface collection at Ulu Leang 2 included numerous earthenware sherds  interpreted as the remnants of large mortuary containers, associated with glass beads and iron  fragments, and the unburnt remains of at least 50 individuals. The Leang Paja surface collection  yielded medium-sized to large jars, along with ornate covers and bowls, and numerous unburnt  human fragments (Flavel 1997, 2006). Open-air burial sites to the south of Leang-Leang include  Takbuncinik with its suspected primary burials in large jars, Bonto Ramba with its reported  association of a Heger IA bronze kettle drum alongside cremations in burial jars, and Papanlohea  where a Heger IA kettle drum appears to have been used as a burial container (Table 8.4). terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="11"> 8.  Traditions of Jars as Mortuary Containers in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago    151  Further north in Sulawesi, three burial jars were excavated at Bukit Pantaraan on the Karama  River, associated with ornaments of iron, bronze, gold, glass and polished stone (no preserved  human remains). The charred residues from some apparently associated potsherds date to the  early to middle first millennium BC, so either the association is spurious or the date is too old  (Anggraeni 2012). The three earthenware jars recovered from Pontanoa Bangka, on the northern  shore of Lake Matano, stratified above a charcoal sample dating to cal. AD 900–1190, probably  contained cremated human remains in association with twelfth- to fourteenth-century glass  beads (Bulbeck and Caldwell 2000). In addition, a field of 11 large jars was excavated in 1938  at Sabbang Loang, where a river critical for trade with the hinterland meets the coastal plain.  Re-excavations in 1998–1999 recovered an additional jar from this field of around 1 m high and  wide (Figure 8.2) and isolated examples of similar jars across a 2 hectare area uphill from the urn  field. The acidic soils explain the lack of human remains in the jars, which evidently lacked grave  goods, but they can be dated to the early centuries AD based on a consistent series of five charcoal  dates from the associated, Palaeometallic habitation deposits (Bulbeck and Caldwell 2000).

In Southeast Sulawesi, excavations at Gua Lampetia cave yielded a single jar similar to the  Sabbang Loang jars (Figure 8.3), but up to a millennium later, based on the thermoluminescence  dates of AD 1140±60 for the jar and 1050±120 for the cover. The ca. 60 cm tall jar, which was  coated with dammar tree resin, contained the commingled remains of five adult and subadult  individuals, a bone pendant and a ring of marine shell from the coast. Both at Gua Lampetia  and two nearby caves, there was an earlier or contemporary mortuary practice of extended  inhumations (Bulbeck et al. 2016). Large earthenware mortuary jars are also reported as surface  finds at the Rukuo and Anawai caves in the Matarombeo Massif to the east of Gua Lampetia, but  no information has been provided as to their likely antiquity (Fage 2014). terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="12"> 152    New Perspectives in Southeast Asian and Pacific Prehistory Southwest of Sulawesi, in the southwest corner of the archipelago, the northern beaches of Bali  and Java have revealed five Palaeometallic cemeteries that evidently represent a shared tradition.  These cemeteries, Pacung, Bondalem, Gilimanuk (Bali), Anyer Lor and Plawangan (Java), are  distinguished by a predominance of extended inhumations and the minority presence of jar  burials (Table 8.2). A sixth cemetery on the coastal plain, at Batujaya in West Java (early centuries  AD), is currently documented with just nine extended inhumations (Widianto 2006), though  it too may also reveal a minority presence of jar burials with future excavations. Pacung, dated to between the late second millennium BC and first century AD, includes  a primary infant burial and an adult skull burial in locally made jars that had been cut to admit  the human remains, and then covered with local imitations of Indian-style dishes (Calo et al.  2015). Bondalem was heavily eroded before it could be recorded, and so it is not known whether  the beads and bronzes collected from the site were grave goods (Ardika 2000). At Gilimanuk,  the jar burials involved secondary interments of infants, children and young adults (but no  older adults) with similar Palaeometallic grave goods to the wider range documented for the  Gilimanuk direct interments. The cemetery’s period of use started contemporarily with Pacung  but lasted till late in the first millennium AD (Aziz 2012).  Anyer Lor included two large earthenware urns, a disturbed jar that reportedly contained a  primary adult burial, and a 76 cm tall jar (73 cm girth) with a secondary adult burial and  some carnelian beads (Van Heekeren 1956). At Plawangan, the burial jars were cylindrical jars  measuring 22–60 cm tall and up to 90 cm in girth, including one ‘double jar burial’ involving  two cylindrical jars stacked rim to rim. All of the jar burials were secondary, and the grave goods  included beads of glass and carnelian and items of iron and bronze. The richest burial, associated  with gold and earthenware pots, was interred inside a Heger IA kettle drum (Soegondho 1995).  Interestingly, the use of a Heger IA kettle drum as a burial container, in this case cut open to  admit the corpse, is also recorded from Manikliyu in inland Bali (Sutaba 2006). Survey and excavation in southern Sumatra have recorded 13 open sites with earthenware burial  jars and Palaeometallic grave goods. These sites have a documented chronological range between  the seventh and sixteenth centuries AD (Table 8.5), and evidently represent a local tradition  that continued into the eleventh century when megaliths started to become a prominent feature  within the local settlements (Bonatz et al. 2006). To date, jar burials have not been reported from the northern half of Sumatra nor the Thai-Malay  Peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra. However, immediately north of the Isthmus of Kra, at the  northwest margin of the archipelago, Khao Sam Kaeo (KSK) yielded a burial jar with the cremated  remains of two children directly dated to 260–50 cal. BC. The burial is contemporary with the  main occupation phase of KSK as a massive fortified site involved in the production of ironware  and glass and stone ornaments as well as the maritime trade of these and other luxury goods  (Bellina-Pryce and Silapanth 2006). Presumably, the burial had been part of a larger cemetery  subsequently destroyed by riverine erosion. Decorated pottery similar to that at KSK has been  recovered from the disturbed mortuary cave sites of Tham Tuay (associated with a charcoal date  of 156±34 BC, Wk-3088) and Tham Pla, with closest external parallels to Hoa Diem and other  Sa Huynh sites of southern coastal Vietnam (Bellina et al. 2012). The Sa Huynh culture features  numerous jar burials and other mortuary disposals associated with a rich array of Palaeometallic  grave goods, and marked the occupation of this stretch of Vietnam by the ancestors of the Cham,  the only documented Malayo-Polynesian speakers on Mainland Southeast Asia (Dzung 2011).  Thus, the mortuary sites directly north of the Isthmus of Kra may be assigned to a tradition  related to coastal Vietnam. terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="13"> 8.  Traditions of Jars as Mortuary Containers in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago    153  Later mortuary jar disposals (ca. AD 1200 onwards) The examples covered in the previous section include traditions that continued after AD 1200,  at  southeastern Sabah (based on the estimated chronologies), Sumatra (Table 8.5), and the  Makasar-speaking region of South Sulawesi (Saukang Boe, Talaborong and probably Bonto Lakja  Selatan, Table 8.4). Makasar mortuary practices generally switched over to extended inhumations  during the late pre-Islamic period between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, whereas  their Bugis neighbours interred the cremated remains of their deceased in large imported ceramic  jars, especially coarse stoneware ‘martavans’, as did the Wotu and Lemolang speakers at the  northeast of the Bugis range (Bulbeck and Caldwell 2000; Druce et al. 2005). The Bugis practice  of cremation potentially reflects cultural influence from classical Java (Bulbeck 1996–1997),  but the use of jars as mortuary containers was already well established in southwest Sulawesi  (Table 8.4). Storage in caves of locally made stone mortuary jars is reported for two Kulaman Plateau sites in  Mindanao. Noting an eighteenth-century coin in one of these jars, Maceda (1964) interpreted  them as a continuation of an older practice of manufacturing earthenware mortuary jars. An  orderly transition from Palaeometallic to later times is also evident for the mortuary jars on  Fuga Island to the immediate north of Luzon. These jars were buried in the ground or in coral,  or placed inside coral cairns, without grave goods (Solheim 1960). The larger jars, designed  for primary disposals, included martavans as well as earthenware vessels, while both imported  stoneware and earthenware jars were used as smaller containers for secondary disposals. Solheim  reported an early first millennium AD dating for the imported jars, but such an early dating has  not been repeated in later publications. As Solheim (1960) noted, the use of jars as mortuary  containers could have continued till quite recently on Fuga Island, especially as the practice  reportedly persisted on the Batanes until the eighteenth century. In the Visayas, jar-burial sites postdating AD 1200 include Pilar and Banton Cave. The 24 jar  burials excavated at Pilar included typically ‘Palaeometallic’ grave goods whereas the Banton jar  burial was associated with Indian textiles (Table 8.3). In Luzon, the use of imported ceramics as  mortuary containers includes thirteenth- to fourteenth-century martavans containing cremated  remains at Agra and Pila (Tenazas 1968), an early Ming jar holding bone fragments at Tala (Paz et  al. 2013), two sites on Cagraray Island (Fox and Evangelista 1957b) and Cabarruan in northern  Luzon (Henson 1992). However, between the thirteenth century and the seventeenth century,  when Christianity was widely adopted in the Philippines, direct inhumations and secondary  burials in pits were the dominant mortuary disposals, with the tempayans and other high-fired,  imported ceramics interred as grave goods (Clark 2013; Dueppen 2013; Sinopoli 2013).  Near Lake Towuti in Southeast Sulawesi, Grubauer (1913) recorded a recently practised tradition  that involved the secondary disposal of deceased, aristocratic adults in martavans. These jars  were carried in wooden litters to the same caves where the commoner adults (secondarily stored  in wooden coffins) were also taken, as well as the disinterred remains of children (aristocratic  and commoner) for secondary disposal. Of the numerous caves near Lake Towuti with visible  remains consistent with this tradition, Gua Andomo, Gua Lampetia and Gua Sambagowala  were excavated. These yielded imported ceramics dating approximately between the fifteenth  and nineteenth centuries, which would appear to be the time range for the tradition, along with  personal adornments such as glass beads and ornaments of bronze and brass (Bulbeck et al. 2016).  This tradition is unique in Sulawesi ethnography, although the Gua Lampetia earthenware burial  jar and Bugis/Wotu ceramic jar burials are potential antecedents. terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="14"> 154    New Perspectives in Southeast Asian and Pacific Prehistory The uniqueness of the Lake Towuti tradition in Sulawesi ethnography prompted Grubauer  (1913) to speculatively associate it with a tribal immigration from Borneo. Certainly, the use  of martavans as mortuary containers is recorded ethnographically amongst the Ngaju of the  Central Kalimantan uplands, some of the Iban of Sarawak and Sabah (Harrisson 1990), and the  Kajang, Melanau, Berawan, Kelabit and Lun Dayeh of Sarawak (Winzeler 2004). In Sarawak,  the jars served both as containers to hold the corpse while the soft tissues decomposed, and as  the final repository where the bones were stored after collection and cleaning. The jars were  then displayed either on wooden funerary monuments (Winzeler 2004) or (as recorded for the  Kelabit) in rockshelters, or atop megalithic constructions, which also included stone jars holding  the remains of the deceased (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2010). The chronology of this tradition based  on typological dating of the jars is the sixteenth to early twentieth centuries (Harrisson 1990;  Lloyd-Smith et al. 2010). Discussion and conclusions Indo-Malaysian jar-burial horizons Three jar-burial horizons can be discerned for the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago. These horizons are  identifiable from their rapid, initial appearance across a considerable portion of the archipelago,  although in some cases they appear to have formed the basis for traditions of considerable  longevity within designated parts of Indo-Malaysia. The oldest horizon involved mortuary jars of variable size, used for primary disposals only for  subadults, which co-occurred with other burial modes within the same cemetery. Neolithic  examples of this horizon include Niah West Mouth in Borneo and the Manunggul A and  Arku caves in the Philippines (Tables 8.1 to 8.3), as well as Teouma in Vanuatu (Valentin et al.  2015). According to Valentin et al. (2015), the cultural basis for this horizon may have been a  predilection for complex mortuary rituals, which may well have emerged specifically in Indo- Malaysia. Thus, recognising that certain sites represent the same horizon need not imply a single  source of external influence for their shared practice of jar burials.  There is a geographic distinction between the predominantly paddle-impressed Neolithic pottery  of the western archipelago (including Niah) and the frequently red-slipped Neolithic pottery of  the eastern archipelago (Bulbeck 2008), which may respectively relate to early immigration of  Austroasiatic speakers from Mainland Southeast Asia and Austronesian speakers from Taiwan  (Simanjuntak, Chapter 1, this volume). The case for these separate origins of the Niah and  Philippines jar-burial traditions is further supported by the early appearance of bronze at Niah,  as noted earlier in this chapter.  terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="15"> 8.

Traditions of Jars as Mortuary Containers in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago    157  The second horizon involved the specialism of large burial jars, usually of pottery, but including  the use of covers and sometimes jars of stone in the southern half of the Philippines. This horizon  covers sites securely dated to the early centuries AD in the Batanes Islands, Mindanao (Table 8.3)  and Sulawesi (Sabbang Loang), as well as various ca. first millennium AD sites in the Talaud  Islands (Leang Buidane), the Moluccas (Uattamdi), Sumba (Melolo and Lambanupa), and  especially Sumatra (Table 8.5). The widespread distribution of this horizon corresponds well  with Bellwood’s (1997) overview of the Palaeometallic as a time of expanding trade linkages  across the archipelago. That said, it was also a time of intensified cultural contact between the  western archipelago and South Asia (e.g. Calo et al. 2015) and between the Batanes and Taiwan  (Bellwood and Dizon 2013b). Accordingly, the fact that large jars dominate the jar burials of  southern Sumatra and the Batanes, at opposite ends of the Archipelago, may reflect their status  as independent developments inspired, respectively, by influence from South Asia and Taiwan.  The case for Taiwan as the source for the Batanes large mortuary jars is strengthened by the  prevailing use of the Taiwan mortuary jars for primary burials (Valentin et al. 2015). Figure 8.4 Twelve Indo-Malaysian traditions using jars as mortuary containers. Source: Compiled and drawn by D. Bulbeck, based on Table 8.6. The most recent horizon involved the use of large imported jars, especially martavans, for holding  the cremated remains of the deceased. The geographic extent of this horizon reached from Fuga  Island in the north to Borneo in the west and Sulawesi in the south. In the case of southwest  Sulawesi, there appears to have been a switch from earthenware to stoneware and porcelain burial  jars when the latter became readily available through maritime trade at around the fourteenth  century AD (Bulbeck 1996–1997). However, in the case of Borneo, there are no immediate  earthenware antecedents for the use of martavans as large mortuary containers. terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="18"> 158    New Perspectives in Southeast Asian and Pacific Prehistory Indo-Malaysian jar-burial traditions The preceding review of the archaeological evidence refers on several occasions to local traditions  covering similar mortuary assemblages found across a definable area. These imply a strong case  for cultural continuity in terms of the vertical inheritance and horizontal transmission of beliefs  on the appropriate treatment of the deceased. Taking this approach to its logical conclusion,  we may propose a schema of 14 traditions to cover all of the previously reviewed sites with  jars used as mortuary containers (Figure 8.4, Table 8.6). The purpose of this schema is not  to produce a rigid classification of the archipelago’s mortuary-jar sites – other interpretations  involving a smaller or larger number of traditions are certainly possible – but to illustrate that the  variability is productively managed through the recognition of multiple traditions. In addition,  the assignment of sites to separate traditions need not imply the absence of contacts reflected  by the jar-burial horizons. For instance, haematite staining of a proportion of the Niah, Tabon  and Arku Cave burials may reflect shared adoption of an ancillary mortuary practice between  Sarawak and Luzon during the late Neolithic and early Palaeometallic. The least convincing of my traditions is arguably the ‘middle Philippines’ tradition, recognised  essentially on the basis of a reasonable likelihood of these islands’ jar-burial sites tracing back to  early colonisation by Austronesian speakers. In contrast, the ‘Sulawesi ethnohistorical’ tradition  satisfies all the requirements of a tradition, being documented for numerous sites and appearing  to be the only mortuary practice in operation around Lake Towuti between ca. AD 1500 and  1900. It evidently crossed three language groups whose common adoption of the tradition can be  attributed to participation in the burgeoning local trade in dammar resin (Bulbeck et al. 2016).  The ‘North Java/Bali’ tradition also works well as a tradition, even if one of the distinguishing  features is the minority presence of jar burials in these similar cemetery sites. The shared mortuary  practices can be attributed to the persistence of this coastal stretch as a node for a maritime trade  network that extended to the eastern archipelago (e.g. Calo 2014). The ‘Borneo ethnohistorical’  tradition can also be understood in terms of a trade network, in this case the high esteem placed  on imported, large ceramic jars across much of Borneo. This is a critical context for understanding  the mortuary use of these jars, which were also ritually important for the fermentation of rice  for festivals and strategic displays of prestige (Harrisson 1990). In addition, the appearance of  jar burials in southeastern Sabah, as well as general similarities in pottery production, apparently  relates to Palaeometallic interactions across the Sulawesi Sea (Bellwood 1988b), an interaction  sphere suggested here to have extended to southwest Sulawesi (Figure 8.4).  Cultural implications The Niah Neolithic cemeteries are interpreted as corporate mortuary centres where the dispersed  local communities, whose subsistence basis probably depended more on foraging than farming,  displayed their broader social relations through the collective burial of the deceased (Lloyd- Smith et al. 2013). Similarly, Bonatz (2012) suggests that the Sumatra highland jar-burial sites  served as ritual centres for the dispersed communities settled on the ridges to commemorate  their perception of a collective ancestry in the hinterland valleys. Many of the Philippine sites  would also be open to interpretation as cemeteries for the ancestors recognised by multiple  communities as the basis for their corporate interests transcending the local community, although  at least one site, Tumagudtad, was directly associated with a single settlement (Solheim 1960).  A similar situation may apply to the southwest Sulawesi prehistoric sites, where Sabbang Loang  and Galesong would appear to have been trading centres that proclaimed their independence  through their jar-burial fields, whereas the communal ossuaries (including Leang Codong, which  lacks mortuary jars) appear to have symbolised a collective claim to prime agricultural land  (Bulbeck 2010).  terra australis 45 </page> <page sequence="19"> 8.  Traditions of Jars as Mortuary Containers in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago    159  One advantage of recognising multiple traditions (Table 8.6) is the demonstration of the contrast  between those where most, if not all, of the disposals of human remains were contained by jars  (e.g. the southern Sumatra tradition) and those with only a small minority inside jars (e.g. the  Niah and North Java/Bali traditions). Also, where jar containers were in the minority, they were  sometimes associated with higher-status individuals (Niah and Sulawesi ethnohistorical traditions)  and sometimes with lower-status (Arku Cave) or younger individuals (Gilimanuk). Where the  deceased person was a child or reduced to fragments through preliminary mortuary rites, then the  sorts of jars in common domestic use would have been large enough for deployment as mortuary  containers. However, where large jars were used, these would have required considerable potting  skill to be robust enough to hold their contents for the duration of the mortuary ceremony,  and would have depended on sufficient personal wealth for their acquisition (especially with  the imported jars). Accordingly, locally available technological skills and/or community social  status may have been factors that affected whether there was no use, occasional deployment  or thoroughgoing reliance on jars as mortuary containers – within a complex web of ancestor- worship beliefs that would have varied greatly from place to place and time to time.
