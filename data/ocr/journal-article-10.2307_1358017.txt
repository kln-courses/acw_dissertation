HOBBS A contextual investigation of Louise Nevelson's Sky Cathedral (see cover illustration) cannot possibly begin with the work itself; it has to go back to the beginning of the 20th century when traditional attitudes toward sculpture started to be questioned, and the solid mass, once considered requisite was broken up and declared no longer inviolable. In the 20th century, sculpture, more than any medium, has been subject to changing attitudes toward matter, motion, and the dominance of painting. Because it has been priapic, permanent, and imposing, one might say sculpture was the art most suited to masculine ambition. The "masculine" na- ture of sculpture underwent a great crisis in this century when it was overwhelmed by a new awareness of space and matter. The resultant effect was that monu- mentality was no longer believable, three-dimensionality became at best a tentative endeavor, and advanced sculp- ture turned to attentuated forms and flattened shapes that tended toward a two-dimensional, almost pictorial, orientation. Throughout the first half of the 20th century inno- vative artistic thinking tended to be two-dimensional: sculptors were locked into a flattened concept of the universe in which the raised relief and the three- dimensional line drawing offered the only viable means. Since painting was the dominant art, American sculptors of the period were caught in the dilemma of how to energize space and how to create three-dimensional forms that would be believable and significant. Alexander Calder, one of the most successful, made motion a literal component of his mobiles, which he first created in the 1930s. Using a formal vocabulary taken from Jean Arp and Juan Mir6, he cut two-dimensional shapes out of sheet metal, balanced them on wires, painted them in primary colors and then allowed them to glide freely in the air. All his individual achievements were two-dimensional; only movement made them occupy three-dimensional space. His wires were lines that cut into space, and his brightly colored shapes were planes defining it. Solid three-dimensional form, though, in Calder's hands, acknowledged the overwhelming force of space and used motion for turning an essentially two- dimensional schema into a three-dimensional form. In the work of David Smith, the duel between solid form and encroaching space was never to be resolved. It was acknowledged at the beginning of his career as an important tension. Although the early Head as Still Life (1931) oscillates between the two-dimensional and three-dimensional, it relies basically on a two- dimensional framing device. The sculpture then becomes a pictorialization of the third dimension, and the indi- vidual shapes might as well have been painted as sculpted. Smith was still involved in drawing two- dimensionally in the early 1950s. His Australia (1951), remarkable for the way welded steel is energized with the quickness and surety of a drawn line as well as for its reliance on an essentially pictorial type of representation, still testifies to the ultimate inability of sculpture to sur- mount an inherent two-dimensional bias. Throughout his work Smith maintains a pictorial outlook and con- sistently creates works that demand a frontal orientation. Even the grand Cubics of the 1960s remain portals and doorways; the robustness of the solid geometric com- ponents is denied by an almost impressionistic handling of the burnished surface. Each cube is hollowed out by the polished gestural surface and turned into a mirror. The scultpure remains essentially a solidification of two- dimensional drawing. The problem does not hinge on whether David Smith was a major sculptor or not: unquestionably he was a major figure of the period. The problem is that for many reasons monumental sculpture-a massive grouping of three-dimensional forms-was no longer possible. It is as if the sculptors were playwrights who wished to resurrect tragedy in the classical sense and were doomed to failure. Twentieth-century concepts toward mass and</page><page sequence="3">40 Woman's Art Journal space have changed, and all the arts have acknowledged this attitude. Sculpture, even abstract sculpture, in some way maintains ties with the anthropomorphic, and a new concept of being in the 20th century causes mass to lose its unquestioned force. The self, a constant source for sculpture, is conceived of in a new manner: it is no longer an object, a complete entity; it is more a force field of energy. Seeming to reflect this new abstract concept of the self, sculpture becomes less and less a monument as its mass is corroded with new, different, and dynamic concepts as energy, speed, space and time. The problem is that the magical belief in virtual form-the sense of a powerful presence-that great sculp- ture through the centuries has created, was simply no longer possible. If an object veered outside its own en- capsulating cage or moved beyond the type of solidified plane geometry that became symptomatic of the best work, this sense of presence was destroyed, and the work of art became an object. The objectification of a piece of sculpture in the 1940s and 1950s was feared by sculp- tors as "decoration" was feared by painters. In both cases the work of art was in danger of becoming a manu- factured product, an inert object incapable of signifying more than itself as it became an illustration or a piece of empty rhetoric. Obviousness at all costs was to be avoided by artists. Not until Pop and Minimalism could the "objecthood" of a work of art be considered of value and the obvious worth investigating. For example, Minimalist Donald Judd wanted to create specific ob- jects that referred to nothing beyond themselves. But older sculptors such as David Smith and Louise Nevelson were concerned with creating an art that called to mind totems and idols and seemed in some way to be living. Nevelson does not try, like Smith, to surmount the obstacles facing sculpture; instead, she mines the limita- tions to create a new form that cuts across traditional boundaries to theater and painting. Perhaps, because she was not caught up in traditional macho-attitudes regarding monument building, she could avoid tradi- tional notions about what sculpture should be, and con- sequently accept it simply for what it offered. Her work in the 1950s rarerly attempts to move beyond the planar. As a matter of fact, in pieces like Sky Cathedral she relies on a frontal orientation. The sculpture consists of a series of boxes stacked one on top of the other, each box resembling a deep wooden relief or a shallow stage- like setting. What distinguishes Sky Cathedral from other sculptures is its theatricality. When Sky Cathedral was installed originally in the Museum of Modern Art in 1956, Nevelson illuminated it with a dark light and placed a pole in front of it. The line formed by the pole makes the space between the pole and the sculpture a discrete entity. The use of special lighting, the overall blackness of the work, and the pole standing out from it, all suggest that Nevelson is involved in creating a theatrical space, theatrical mean- ing a fantastic timeless space; some have even called it periences while watching a play when the theater be- comes a realm of enchantment. One's disbelief is momen- tarily suspended and one's sense of time is also adjusted so that time ceases to be actual-it becomes the make- believe time suggested in a play. The theatricality of Sky Cathedral is reinforced by the boxes which become miniaturized stage sets. If all the boxes lay along a con- tinuous grid, the effect would be of a solidified film strip. But the boxes do not lie on a continuous line; they are not all the same size; they, in fact, do not all appear on the same plane. The sculpture has a total effect of pocketed foci, and no one box serves as a main focus for the piece. Because of its dispersed character, the work becomes an image for peripheral scanning, a way of looking that is rein- forced by the overall black color and the dark room. The piece, in short, appears in very much the same fashion as an abstract expressionist painting: it is large, wall-sized, allover in configuration, and arranged so as to be seen under dimmed light at a time when peripheral vision is stronger than focused seeing. The type of look- ing-accurately pinpointed by the title Sky Cathedral- is cosmic, embracing and environmental. In a later piece, Moon Garden + One, shown in 1958 at Grand Central Moderns, Nevelson created a total environment. She removed the desk and chairs from the gallery and even blocked off one of the windows. Only her sculpture remained, intensified with a blue light that created an unreal aura suggestive of science fiction. The incipient environmental aspect of Sky Cathedral was actualized in this piece, which became a three- dimensional stage set for viewers to walk into. Realizing the difficulty of making sculpture three-dimensional, Nevelson turned the gallery into a larger box. The problem of three-dimensional sculpture was avoided in her sculpture-rather than embracing and actuating space, her sculpture surrounded and harbored it. The room became analogous to one of her boxes-it was closed and hermetic. The theater did not reach out; it sur- rounded and enclosed. Space was no longer something external; it was internal, a metaphor for the internal sphere of the psyche. Nevelson's sources are varied; they range over the 20th century, and among painters, collagists, and sculp- tors. A student of Hans Hoffman in the 1930s, one of the few in fact to study in Germany with him, Nevelson in her sculpture is concerned with cubist space and with Hoffman's "push-pull," a variant on the cubist infra- structures. She admits to the importance of Cubism to her art and has referred to the space of her work as cubist. In Sky Cathedral most of the individual elements are flat and planar, like a cubist composition. The few affirmedly three-dimensional forms tend to be used more to create a silhouette than a three-dimensional space, thus following cubist interest in flatness. The individual boxes could be considered a junk collector's rendition of Synthetic Cubism. A comparison between Picasso's reliefs of the teens and any one box from Sky Cathedral sug- etherealized space. It is the kind of space that one ex-</page><page sequence="4">Woman's Art Journal 41 gests the intimate relationship between the two. Both are essentially planar and in low relief; the differences are that the Picasso reliefs often constitute abstract correlatives for realistic objects and remain small, exud- ing a certain preciousness while the Nevelson is abstract and environmental. One could, of course, say that the boxes are a working out of Picasso's Cubism, and the analysis would be correct as far as it goes. Nevelson her- self has suggested this. Even though resemblances be- tween the two are important and not to be passed over lightly, the differences are worth taking into con- sideration. The main difference between Nevelson and Picasso is in the meaning of the imagery. In Nevelson's walls the boxes are important; in the sculptures they achieve feminine overtones. The boxes have strong sexual con- notations because a box is slang for woman in general and for her lower torso in particular. Nevelson is fa- miliar with this meaning and has undertaken to person- alize it. As her dealer Arnold Glimcher has noted in his analysis of her work: Nevelson's awareness of the sexuality of her work con- tributed to her waiting so long before she considered publicly showing her work, selling it, and thereby di- vesting herself of self-images.' In the individual boxes some images are hidden beneath jagged boards and sharply pointed sticks while others are completely boarded up. There is also similarity between Nevelson's art and that of Dadaists Jean Arp, who made wood reliefs in the teens, and Kurt Schwitters, who originated a dadaist art about the same time that he termed "Merz." Arp's wood reliefs are much more finished than Nevelson's: there is less dependency on the expressive nature of the ma- trial and more interest in formal properties enriched by chance. Arp's work achieved an organic effect through judicious and thoughtful handling of rounded forms, while the organic nature of Nevelson's material appears to be more a result of its survival. Schwitters, always the alchemist, uses his bits of detritus to create radiant late cubist collages. His concern for his found material grew to such an extent that he created several Merzbaus, as he termed them, junk metamorphosized into loose con- structivist environments. His materials retain traces of their origins; his environments become vast three- dimensional collages. Nevelson has denied knowing Schwitter's work until the late 1950s when Jean Arp introduced it to her, but even if she knew of his work, her knowledge of it would not make her innova- tions less important. By unifying her three-dimensional collages with paint she shifts the focus. Her work be- comes more theatrical than Schwitters, less collaged archi- tectural constructions, and more mysterious presences. Another sculptor worth mentioning in relation to Nevelson is Joseph Cornell. Cornell's enclosed boxes are elaborations of Victorian shadow-box frames turned into surreal scrapbook environments that bring together seemingly unrelated elements to create a new magical environment. The relation between Cornell and Nevel- son is to be found not only in their common use of boxes as miniature stage sets, but also in their fasci- nation with dance. Cornell, a bachelor who shared an unassuming residence in Queens with his brother, was fascinated with the ballet and with innovative dancers such as Loie Fuller and Isadora Duncan. His small boxes often contain laboriously sought out images of dancers. Nevelson likewise was fascinated by the dance, but in- stead of seeking out specific images and keeping tabs on the developing iconography of dance, she studied modern dance and eurythmics for over 20 years with Ellen Flanagan, wife of sculptor John Flanagan. During this time she felt she learned to come to terms with her center of gravity and in her words "touched her life force." Eurythmics is concerned with inner rhythm and is a metaphysical-cum-mystical approach to dance. Long interested in metaphysics, Nevelson was at one point devoted to Krishnamurti, the Indian mystic so important to Jackson Pollock. To hear Nevelson talk, or to read her interviews, is to become acquainted with Krishna- murti's ideas of becoming and of attaching oneself firmly to one's own lifeline: she constantly proselytizes the im- portance of becoming oneself. It is hard to see a direct correspondence between Nevelson's interest in dance and her great walls, circular reliefs, and totemic figures, except to say that she seems to be choreographing a ballet when she creates an en- vironment. The arrangement of Dawn's Wedding Feast, for example, has some of the ritualistic solemnity found in Martha Graham's ballets of the 1930s and 1940s that Nevelson has often remarked on. The proscenium stage and facade orientation that Nevelon uses in her sculp- ture, moreover, can be related to her interest in ballet. But this frontality also has other sources, and appears to be one of the underlying problems besetting sculpture in the 20th century. While specific connections between Nevelson's sculpture and eurhythmics cannot be made, one senses the quality of rhythm, the feeling for centers of gravity, balance, repose, and active forms counteract- ing static ones. Nevelson strongly identifies with her sculpture. She has related that in 1956 she created a whole scenario that involved her sculptures and herself. She fantasized about her pieces as she made them. One became a black wed- ding cake, another, First Personage (both in the Brook- lyn Museum), about 61/2 high, 2' deep and 21/' wide, seemed to Nevelson to be a bridegroom, and she the bride. As she studied the piece, a knot above the half- way mark appeared to be a mouth; at one point it even seemed to move and she became frightened.2 This identification with her works-seeing them as protagonists-is radically different from the Minimalist approach to sculptural form that was to occur only a few years later. Nevelson's work is not simply a formalist working out of principles. Whatever she does to her chosen raw materials, she feels she is doing to herself. With each piece she is in some way inextricably joined.</page><page sequence="5">42 Woman's Art Journal This attitude ties Nevelson to Abstract Expressionism no matter how much she disclaims the relationship and touts her own unorthodox, individual, original approach. In fact, the emphasis on individuality and the disregard of orthodoxy places her right in the midst of the Abstract Expressionists. Nevelson's work even resembles that of Clyfford Still: both have evolved a similar organic atti- tude, use jagged forms, play on positive-negative space, and prefer matte textures. The material itself is tremendously meaningful to her. In the 1950s it was usually wood. In the 1940s and 1950s Nevelson picked up wood scraps, old pieces of furniture and remnants of turn-of-the-century architec- ture on the streets of New York. Later, out of necessity, she turned to blocks and dowels taken from lumberyards. Even though some of the pieces are splintered and broken, and many are architectural remnants, Nevelson views her material as alive and virginal. When she coats the various pieces gathered from many different places with a common black, white, or gold paint, she unifies them in a new composition. At that point she believes that she cancels out their former identities. To those who insist on viewing spindles as spindles, pieces of jig- sawed bargeboards as remnants of 19th century Carpen- ters Gothic or the like, Nevelson retorts that some people cannot hear a piece's music because they are concentrat- ing on unessentials: "It's like," she has said, "there's an opera, this great singer and you're listening to the sound." For her the composition and its effect is the art; the history of the individual elements is unimportant. To Nevelson wood is alive, and the living quality is important. When she cuts or splinters a piece, she is careful to take into consideration the form in which she found it. She also maintains that when she hammers a nail through a piece of wood, there is a crying out if it is not done properly. When Nevelson affirms that the history of her ele- ments are unimportant, she overstates her case. The denial of the history of the pieces of wood is not in accordance with her first use of the material during World War II when she dispaired because her son Mike was in the war: And I recall that my work was black and it was all enclosed,-all enclosed. I couldn't think of doing a piece in the round. I would use black velvet and close the boxes. In other words, this was a place of great secrecy within myself. I didn't even realize the motivation of it; it was all subconscious, it was the expression of a mood. But it isn't only one son. It's also that the world was at war and every son was at war. And it was an atmosphere in the world, right through the world. I evidently live so much in the world and out of the world, both places, that I was right in the middle of it. And I thought at the time that I would never have a piece of work in the open again. Often she has used the term "livingness" to refer to the organic nature of her materials. Also she has taken to take dross substances and turn them into art. Cre- ativity has, for Louise Nevelson, distinct feminine over- tones. The creative act is associated with wood, a living material. Sculpture at a certain point in her career be- comes an embodiment of her sense of self-her secret enclosed self-and the sculptural space frequently is womblike and hermetic. I The importance of black to Nevelson's sculpture is manifold: black causes the forms to recede and merge, becoming planes, and black imbues the work with mys- tery. Nevelson extolls the merits of black, which she sees as the merging of all colors. To her it does not, of necessity, suggest death or mourning any more than white connotes life. Such readings she views as simplistic even though at times she has used them-as when she compared her black environment, Moon Garden + One with Dawn's Wedding Feast, a work in white made es- pecially for an exhibition at the Museum of Modem Art in 1959. Referring to herself as an Architect of Shadow, she said: "Shadow is fleeting . . . and I arrest it and I give it a solid substance. I think I gave it as strong a form as the material object that gives me the shadow . . . probably stronger. More valid. And that satisfies me . . . that a shadow can have the weight and form of other things. I arrest it and I give it architecture as solid as anything can be." When making Dawn's Wedding Feast Nevelson said that she would become an Architect of Light. White became a positive because it represented a marriage with the world, whereas black was the color of her depression during World War II. Her feelings then about black and white are am- biguous; the meanings are also multiple, far ranging, and dependent on specific circumstances. Between the two extremes of value, the main detectable difference is that the individual white shapes cast sharp shadows and stand out against their backgrounds. They become lacy and delicate, less mysterious and somehow, because they are so apparent, more vulnerable. The white figures have the air olf valentines, of richly decorated icing. They are more disparate and less unified: the lack of unity is probably one of the reasons why Nevelson prefers black. Another may be that some of her sources-the stonelike jewelry embellishing ancient Aztec and Mayan figures and American Indian Kachina dolls-became more ap- parent in white. At the same time Nevelson was creating Dawn's Wed- ding Feast, she was starting to use gold in such works as Royal Tide. Differing from black and white, gold, ac- cording to Nevelson, imbues each form with a material- istic splendor. The individual shapes do not become more mysterious, as with black, or more distinct, as with white; they tend to be cancelled out, becoming much less important in themselves and more a source for the rich emanating metallic sheen. Since the late 1920s, when she saw an exhibition of Noh costumes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, gold a different tactic and extolled the extent of her creativity has had a special significance for Nevelson:</page><page sequence="6">Woman's Art Journal 43 . .. There are things in us that we find parallel out- side us, so these Noh kimonos . . . each robe was a universe in itself. . . . Some had gold cloth with medallion, and the cloth was so finely woven that the likes of it I never saw, and then the medallion was gold so it was gold as gold. I looked and I sat down without thinking and I had a barrel of tears in the right eye and a barrel of tears in the left eye .... And then I knew and I said, oh my God, life is worth living if a civilization can give us this great weave of gold and pattern. And so I sat there and sat and wept and wept and sat. The thing that hit me was that they used it with such elegance. It was the reverse of what people think, that gold material was a little vulgar. . . . And I thought, well, if there's been a civilization of this development, then we have to recognize that there is a place on earth that is an essence. I went home and it gave me a whole new life. Even though Louise Nevelson has painted her sculptures white and gold and has worked with the transparencies of plexiglass, she has said: "The only thing is that there was something in me drawing me to the black. I actually think that my trademark and what I like best is the dark, the dusk." For many people Nevelson's black wooden pieces are icons of the post-war period. Her Homage to Six Mil- lion, for example, is an appropriate monument to the Jews killed during World War II. The piece becomes a great enclosing wailing wall, a nonorthodox rood screen or altar of honor. But the feeling of Nevelson's black walls is not all morose, as her Moon Garden + One and Sky Cathedral testify. Her works have been accepted as icons because they are among the most con- vincing 20th century attempts at monumental sculptures and their monumentality is achieved through theatrical means. Nevelson's walls, like Sky Cathedral, use the main elements of the big picture of Abstract Expression- ism and give it a sculptural form; she takes the allover composition, environmental projection, and the dark- ened gallery, thus emphasizing peripheral vision. The space created by Nevelson is less external than internal, less an imposition on the land than a hermetic land- scape. It is a theatrical space that presents an internal realm where forms are reduced to convincing equivalents of light and shadow. ? 1. Arnold B. Glimcher, Louise Nevelson (New York: E. P.
