<plain_text><page sequence="1">Melancholy Landscapes of Modernity: London and Passaic Jacky Bowring ABSTRACT Shuttling between two different worlds - two art- works that are in part fiction and in part fact - this essay gathers up a series of thematic commonalities which represent par- ticular conceptions of landscape. Adopting the spirit of Walter Benjamin's The Arcades Project, the investigation proceeds via juxtaposed pieces of evidence, following his method of present- ing his findings as a series of categories, or "convoi utes." The two works are by filmmaker Patrick Keiller and environmental artist Robert Smithson and are set in two cities, London and Passaic. Keiller's film is set in early 1990s London and is simply called London, and Smithson's "artwork" is an article entitled "The Monuments of Passaic" published in Artforum in 1967, and features both photographs and text. Five convolutes are devel- oped as containers for the observations and coincidences: expe- ditions and field trips, photographs and films, monuments, ruins, and topophilia. Each convolute forms part of a much greater whole, of the melancholy of modernity, which encompasses the spatio-temporal domain* of decay, abandonment, and the ennui of the 20th century. Through the re-imagining of these two cities, the work of Smithson and Keiller offers landscape architecture theoretical apparatuses for bringing fresh eyes to the exhausted settings of daily life. KEYWORDS Melancholy, monuments, ruins, landscape, cities, topophiliâ, superfiction, Robert «Smithson, Patrick Keiller, Walter Benjamin, Situationists PROLOGUE Passaic, September 30th, 1967. London, January 11th, 1 992. Twenty tween these five years two moments and the Atlantic in time and Ocean space. stand Worlds be- tween these two moments in time and space. Worlds apart in many ways, but resonant in their melancholy geography, Passaic and London are discovered as sites of loss, longing, and decay. Landscapes sculpted by eco- nomic and political forces, topographies of social voids and echoing absences, their representation on film crystallizes their desolate Zeitgeist. Despite one being a capital city and one of the world's most well-known cul- tural sites, and the other being an obscure city in New Jersey, USA, there is a remarkable coincidence of a cer- tain mood: the melancholy of modernity. Both cities are excavated as sites stranded in time, victims of progress, but are resuscitated through the methodology of defamiliarization: the re-discovery of the quotidian through making it strange. London is mapped as a melancholy landscape by Patrick Keiller in the film simply called London (Keiller 1994). Filmed as a series of static shots - where the camera records the scene from a fixed point - London charts a sequence of expeditions by Robinson and an unnamed narrator. Neither character appears in the film, and only the voice of Paul Scofield, burdened with a tired gravitas, ennui even, unfurls the narrative. Passaic's poignant terrain is plotted by environmental artist Robert Smithson, whose field trip to the achingly ordinary city of his childhood was recorded in his article in Artforum in December 1967, "The Monuments of Passaic" (Smithson 1967). APPROACHING LONDON AND PASSAIC Walter Benjamin famously stated about his Passagenar- beit or Arcades Project, "Method of this work: literary montage. I needn't say anything. Merely show" (Benja- min 1999, 460). 1 Also known in German as the Passagen- Werk,2 or "Passage Work," the title refers to the passages couverts - the arcades of Paris. However, the idea of a "passage work" also refers to the notion of a work made up of passages, or citations, as in his aspiration for the book. In The Arcades Project Benjamin constructed a set of categories, or "convolutes," into which he placed quotations - the passages - relating to the Paris of the 19th century, most notably its arcades. This method of sampling suggests a type of inductive process, one which through sufficiently extensive information gath- ering (The Arcades Project is 1073 pages long in its pub- lished form) a picture of a place, an impression of an idea, can be created, constructed. Benjamin's method was a pointing out of evidence, of joining dots, of form- ing constellations of ideas and observations. Through the assemblage of "literary montages" Benjamin pro- ceeded through a series of dialectical images, where the adjacency of passages led to sudden revelations or the "profane illumination" of ideas which were otherwise latent or obscured. His sources were broadly divergent, and he alluded to an observation by Schopenhauer, that "to seize the essence of history, it suffices to compare Herodotus and the morning newspaper" (Benjamin E 3 00 &gt;% in c w c o o tņ £ o CD 5 ê CŅ O CM O CD z £ CO CO ° ~~ m c T- I O tH uo I CU oj cr 8? CO o E m 3 d) 3 B QJ &gt;» 8- co co _J o 2J tH V) tH -o o C CN 5 ©</page><page sequence="2">1999, 14). Moreover, Benjamin wrote, "I shall purloin no valuables, appropriate no ingenious formulations. But the rags, the refuse - these I will not inventory but al- low, in the only way possible, to come into their own: by making use of them" (Benjamin 1999, 460). The "method" is essentially embedded within the process of close reading3 in order to excavate the quotations from the works cited, the deployment of the power of juxta- position, and the construction of the framework into which to place these samples. Passaic, September 30th, 1967, and London, Janu- ary 11th, 1992, are the locations of this investigation. Like Schopenhauer's Herodotus and morning news- paper there is a sense of disparity between these two worlds, separated by time and geography, and also by their medium, with one a print work and the other cine- matic. The recognition of a resonance produced a spark that slowly burned through these pieces. The initial mo- ment of realizing a coincidence between the works - that both involved the invention of monuments - was intensified by a closer reading, and through the process of shuttling between the works an amplified sense of an attitude to place and time developed. The two pieces offered parallel visions of landscapes wrought by the processes of modernity, bearing the scars of progress. However, rather than simply surveying these landscapes through a nihilistic frame, the two artists re-cast their chosen landscapes into altered states, part fact and part fiction. The mode of dissemination emphasized this "factional" approach, in both cases framed as a "docu- mentary," resonating with the idea of "superfiction."4 Reflecting on the Passaic project, and one of Smithson's subsequent works, "Strata: A Geographical Fiction," Haddad states, "Conceptual art projects a hypotheti- cal experience. In this hypothetical territory lie open spaces of the imagination where speculation alone can enact the happening of landscape" (Haddad 1996, 54). Passaic is entered via the vehicle of Robert Smith- son's field trip to the achingly ordinary city of his childhood, recorded in his article in Artforum (1967), describing his journey together with photographs, a map, and other imagery. Patrick Keiller's 1994 film Lon- don, was constructed of a series of static shots punctu- ated by intertitles, combining images and text. A series of convolutes is presented here as a documentation of the revelations that the juxtaposition of the two works yielded. Each convolute is developed by a drilling down into these instances, making connections to broader threads of thinking about landscape and melancholy. In the peripatetic peregrinations of expeditions and field trips, in photographs and films, in monuments and ru- ins, and in the unrequited love of place - topophilia - lie the co-ordinates of a landscape of melancholy. While so much of contemporary society's attention, including that of landscape architecture, is directed to "feeling good," melancholy is relegated to being an undesir- able condition. Yet melancholy provides a critical point of balance, the dark against the light, and is bound up in the traditions of contemplation and imaginative speculation that provide a vital core for existence. Mel- ancholy's complex twists and turns are filled with con- tradictions and polarities. This irresolvability presents an enduring tension of impossible longings, of things eternally delayed. Melancholy comes in many forms, and has a vast array of inflections in different languages including the Spanish duende, Turkish hüziXn, French ennui and tristesse, and the Japanese wabisabiand mononoaware.5 Throughout many cultures and many art forms melan- choly's presence is enigmatic and brooding, poignant and contemplative, as in the films of Ingmar Bergman and Michelangelo Antonioni, Edward Hopper's paint- ings, or the music of Tom Waits and Nick Cave.6 Melan- choly even troubles the domain of science, providing a perplexing conundrum for theorists and practitioners of psychology and psychiatry, with Sigmund Freud cen- tral to the theorizing of melancholy. Freud distinguished mourning from melancholia, describing how melan- choly resists resolution. "The complex of melancholia behaves like an open wound," Freud observed, in dis- tinction from normal mourning, which reaches closure (Freud cited in Ramazani 1994, 79). Philosophy, too, has Bowring 215</page><page sequence="3">circled around the theme of melancholy for centuries, even to the extent of being recognized by Slavoj Žižek as the "beginning" of philosophy (Žižek 2001, 148). Sig- nificantly, melancholy was an important point of con- templation for the philosophers of modernity including Soren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. Modernity and progress were double-edged swords, bringing not only the promise of material wealth, but also a perva- sive feeling of estrangement, as Harvie Ferguson put it in his examination of Kierkegaard, "the empty depth of modernity" (Ferguson 1995, 35). The most extensive contribution to the theoriz- ing of melancholy in the twentieth century was that of Walter Benjamin, including his 1928 work on German Trauerspiel (a tragedy or literally, "mourning play"), and the vast work which forms the scaffolding for this study of London and Passaic, the Passagen-Werk. In both the content and method of his research, Benjamin embod- ied melancholy, and was perhaps the archetypical 20th century melancholic. The obsessive, detailed method that drove The Arcades Project resonates with the mel- ancholy of the collector - the Sisyphusean7 evasion of closure and embracing of an eternal incompleteness and fragmentation. Benjamin's arcades were a meta- phor, as Sieburth explains, "a figure for the ephemeral, the passing, the out-of-date, a dense emblem of that particular (capitalist) logic whereby the New is fated, at an ever accelerating rate, to fall out of style and plunge into an eternal oblivion" (Sieburth 1989, 16). Buck-Morss describes how "[t]he arcades that in the nineteenth century housed the first consumer dream worlds appeared in the twentieth century as commod- ity graveyards, containing the refuse of a discarded past" (Buck-Morss 1989, 37-38). The arcades were also a melancholy in their liminality, their threshold quality, as places of passage. The spaces of arcades were tran- sitional zones between the interiors of shops and the wider city spaces - at once "landscapes" and "rooms." Those that strolled through them, the flâneurs, were also liminal in their place in society, inhabiting the edges of the new world of the metropolis, but pulled also by the domain of the middle class (Benjamin 1999, 10). In his notes Benjamin described the feeling of pas- sage experienced at this point of threshold, "At the en- trance to the arcade, a mailbox: the last chance to make some sign to the world that one is leaving" (Benjamin 1999, 88). As well as the arcades, Benjamin divined a network of threshold spaces weaving through the city, "those lines that, running alongside railroad crossings and across private owned lots, within the park and along the river bank, function as limits" (Benjamin 1999, 88). Like Benjamin's Paris, Keiller's London and Smithson's Passaic are cut through with liminality, the in-between moments in time and space that character- ize the melancholy landscapes of modernity. Like the arcades, London and Passaic are "graveyards," filled with the detritus that remains from the preceding era - and it seems quite fitting, then, that within a graveyard one could find monuments, as Keiller and Smithson do. The convolutes in this essay are presented in the spirit of Benjamin, in terms of both their thematic content and the method itself - a literary montage of dialectical images aspiring to moments of profane illumination. CONVOLUTES 1. Expeditions and Field Trips The intertitles8 of London often carry the caption "Ex- pedition," noting the number in the sequence of the expedition, and its destination. This purposeful travel is echoed in Smithson's careful detailing of his destina- tion, his mode of travel, equipment (Instamatic camera, sci-fi novel, art section of the Times), and journey is in- variably referred to in the discourse as a "field trip" (Tsai 2004, 25). A subsequent book about Smithson's work with the German industrial photographers, Bernd and Hilla Becher, is given the title Field Trips, underscor- ing his modus operandi (Becher, Becher, and Smith- son 2002). "Field trip" is a term associated with scholars, re- searchers, or students, with the purpose of gaining firsthand knowledge of a setting. An "expedition" on the 216 Landscape Journal 30:2-11</page><page sequence="4">other hand, has the sense of a trip somewhere, usually for exploration or research. The use of these particular terms by Smithson and Keiller is in both cases paradoxi- cal, and this serves to heighten an underlying sense of the absurd as a means of revelation. Smithson was, af- ter all, not a scholar, researcher, or student - he was an artist. Moreover, he was not going to an institution of knowledge, such as a museum, or an environment of in- terest such as a forest, both the kinds of places that are normally the destinations of field trips. He was going to a city, and not even a new city, but one he knew well. Furthermore, Passaic was not a city that was renowned for something remarkable such as its historic fabric or notable buildings. It was the epitome of quotidian life, commonplace, suburban. Keilleťs disembodied characters' "expeditions" are also contrary, as they are not major journeys into the wilderness or such, but are to familiar landscapes, meticulously observed, to the extent of appearing lu- dicrous. On their expedition to Brent Cross shopping mall, for example, they find themselves moving through a particularly modern kind of space, and as though to underscore this fine-grained observation the narrator intones, "We caught sight of a small, intense man sit- ting near the fountain, reading from a book by Walter Benjamin" (Keiller no date, line 3.44). The line acts as a kind of ligament, an understated resonance, which ties Brent Cross to Benjamin's observations on the arcades of Paris as the quintessence of modern space, places of glass, mirrors, luxury goods on display, "a world in min- iature" ( Illustrated Guide to Paris quoted in Benjamin 1999, 15). Beyond Brent Cross, the excursus traverses Teseo, Ikea, and the landscape surrounding Heathrow airport. There are expeditions, too, to Leicester Square, the City, and Cannon Street, to name just a few of the unremarkable destinations. In all these settings the de- tails are decanted with a slow, intense precision. Both Keilleťs and Smithson's mode of representa- tion is a feigned objectivity. In Smithson's case the field trip is couched as reportage, inflected with the nuanced details of his trip - how he traveled, the film he bought, the lunch he ate - with these fine details suggestive of a carefully controlled mode of working. That he buys a science fiction novel to take along on his journey per- haps underscores this tension between the real and the imaginative reconstruction: at once science and fiction. Keilleťs work, too, is framed within a detached, obser- vational mode, amplified by the fact that we never see the characters mentioned, and the only voice we hear is that of the narrator, in the manner of a documentary. Robinson and the narrator are "researchers," and their topic is the "problem of London." This is reinforced in Keilleťs subsequent film Robinson in Space, where the text of the film refers to Robinson being invited to a meeting with a "well-known international advertising agency" who had "heard of his study of London and wanted to commission him to undertake a peripatetic study of the problem of England. He accepted this offer with alacrity and insisted that I join him as researcher" (Keiller 1999, 6). Keiller and Smithson work in the manner of the Situationists, re-presenting the cities' fabric, reading against the grain, creating "situations." Situationism intersects with geography in the field of psychogeogra- phy, a topic that is implicated throughout Keilleťs Lon- don. As psychogeographers, the artists are adrift in the city, searching for a kind of ideal, like the Situationists' aspirations to "Utopia" - and there is no coincidence that this is one of the intertitles in London. And Smith- son's map of Passaic is shown in color reversal, white on black, and titled "Negative Map Showing Region of the Monuments along the Passaic River." The graphic ma- nipulation, the cutting, and the presence of the monu- ments brings to mind Guy Debord's Situationist map of Paris, where the elements of the city are recogniz- able yet reconfigured, deconstructed, and re-presented (Debord 1957). 2. Photographs and Films The recording of the field trips and expeditions for Smithson and Keiller was via both the visual and the tex- tual. Smithson's "artwork" was in the form of a published Bowring 217</page><page sequence="5">article, including a descriptive text, as well as a number of photographs and a map which located the "monu- ments" he discovered. On the other hand, Keiller's re- cord was primarily visual, with textual supports via the intertitles of the film, which although minimal, perform an indispensible function in the cinematic whole. The linking of the photograph or film with text considerably expands its communicative potential, as Roland Barthes explained, a caption adds an extra layer to a photograph, "the texts loads the image, burdening it with a culture, a moral, an imagination" (Barthes 1977, 26). A further coincidence in the works of Smithson and Keiller was not simply the photographic, but the cinematic. Smithsoīļ was cinematic in his work as an environmental artist, and this connection is most evi- dent in the eponymous film related to his earthwork, Spiral Jetty (see Uroskie 2005). Yet, despite his cinematic modus operandi, his documentation of Passaic was solely by means of black and white still photographs. Keiller's work is also paradoxical, in an inverse sense, as although a "film," London is almost wholly a series of static images. This contradictory deployment of still photos to suggest the cinematic, or the irony of a "film" composed almost completely of static shots, serves to highlight how Smithson and Keiller are working against the grain of their media, and at the same time amplify- ing the play of time in the apprehension of place. Smithson and Keiller construct their own truths via the process of documentation. Through text and image, they simultaneously record and fabricate what they find. It is an act that is carried out unflinchingly and with considerable gravitas, such that the con- structed landscapes appear authentic. The authenticity is a construction; the photographs are simultaneously fantasies and facts, and shot through with irony. As Su- san Sontag explains, "The photographer both loots and preserves, denounces and consecrates" (Sontag 1977, 64-65). Keiller has further explored the re-casting of "real" images as part of an invented reality, or "super- fiction," in his The City of the Future (2005), which cre- ates a hybrid reality through using archival footage of "actuality films" (Clarke 2007). The hybridizing of the factual and the fictional via the devices of photograph and caption relates to a wider genre of texts, all of which reconstruct the familiar urban landscape in ways that challenge a sense of the real. André Breton's Nadja (1999/1928), Georges Rodenbachs Bruges-La-Morte (2007 / 1892), and the works of WG Sebald including The Rings of Saturn (1998/1995) and Vertigo (1999/1990), combine "real" photographs with text and captions in a way which eludes precision. There is an archival mel- ancholy evident in such works, with reality always just out of reach. The works are mired in time, seductive in their apparent realities, yet elusive in their fictionaliz- ing. Photographs and films as landscape superfictions exemplify Matless's observation that, "To judge images only in relation to an assumed real referent is to fail to ask questions of why such images possess a power, why and how they work, and what truths they make" (Mat- less 1993, 204). 3. Monuments A bridge, a sandbox in a suburban playground, a series of drainage pipes, a parking lot - quotidian elements of the city of Passaic. Telecom Tower, Canary Wharf, Leices- ter Square, and Cannon Street - the familiar landscape of London. All of these everyday scenes are recorded on the research journeys made by Smithson and by Keiller's characters. And each of these very ordinary items is el- evated to the status of "monument," a promotion which is highlighted by Smithson's ironically-charged ques- tion, "Has Passaic replaced Rome as the Eternal City?" (Smithson 1967, 51) In Smithson's "suburban Odyssey" the monuments are brought into focus with his Instamatic camera. The stark monochromes document the banal landscape, with their monumental decree coming from the text and captions: the "Monument of Dislocated Direc- tions;" the "Sand-box Monument (also called The Des- ert);" "The Fountain Monument;" and "The Great Pipes Monument."9 In London, the static shots linger over the various points in the landscape and the narrator 218 Landscape Journal 30:2-11</page><page sequence="6">enumerates the invented monuments within his voice- over, where Leicester Square is declared a monument to Laurence Sterne; Canary Wharf "adopted" as a monu- ment to Arthur Rimbaud; Cannon Street designated a "sacred site" - with the Number 15 a "sacred bus route;" and Telecom Tower is imagined as a monument to the tempestuous relationship of Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. The conferring of monumental status upon the el- ements of the ordinary landscape is a form of strange- making, evoking landscape-scale readymades that are descendants of Marcel Duchamp's urinal artwork. The ordinary is made extraordinary through the magic of re- contextualization, just as Duchamp's exhibited urinal became a work of art when placed in a gallery and given the title Fountain. Smithson's similarly named "Foun- tain Monument" is born of such a bestowing of status, where the pipes emerging into the river were elevated to another realm. 10 The monumental vision extends to the extremes of space, from cities to molecules. Keiller's Robinson sometimes "see[s] the whole city as a monument to Rimbaud," (Keiller no date, line 2.26) and Smithson identifies the voids of the city of Passaic as monumen- tal in themselves: "Passaic does seem full of "holes" compared to New York City, which seems tightly packed and solid . . . those holes in a sense are the monumental values that define, without trying, the memory-traces of an abandoned set of futures" (Smithson 1967, 50). At the other extreme, Smithson also sees the monumen- tal in the molecular, writing of the Desert Monument that, "This monument of minute particles blazed under a bleakly growing sun, and suggested the sullen dissolu- tion of entire continents, the drying up of oceans - no longer were there green forests and high mountains - all that existed were millions of grains of sand, a vast deposit of bones and stones pulverized into dust" (Smithson 1967, 51). Echoing this microscopic monu- mentality, Keiller's Robinson "believed that, if he looked at it hard enough, he could cause the surface of the city to reveal to him the molecular basis of historical events, and in this way he hoped to see into the future" (Keiller no date, line 2.31, emphasis in original). As much as Smithson and Keiller plot these monumental moments within the unremarkable landscapes, they also note the spaces of absence. Of the center of Passaic, Smithson observes the "center was no center - it was instead a typical abyss or an ordinary void" (Smithson 1967, 51). And the character of the City of London is described by Keiller's narrator as being "where, at the historic center, there is nothing but a civic void, which fills and empties daily with armies of clerks and dealers, mostly citizens of other towns" (Keiller no date, line 9.21). The monumental and the molecular relate to the geological seam that runs through Smithson's work, most familiar in projects such as the Yucatan and Spi- ral Jetty, and his incisive investigation of New York's Central Park - which in Benjaminian terms he called a "dialectical landscape" where geology and culture were juxtaposed (Smithson 1979). Smithson's library was catalogued following his death, revealing many vol- umes on geology such as Arthur L. Crawford's Geology of Salt Lake County (1964) and Frederick H. Laree's Field Geology (1961), as well as the massive two volume geo- graphical work edited by William L. Thomas together with Carl O. Sauer, Marston Bates, and Lewis Mumford, Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth (1956) (Reynolds 2004). 4. Ruins Developing the parallels between mountains and ruins Tuan observed, "it hardly requires imaginative daring to add that a sentiment congruent with a landscape of ru- ins-geological and man-made- is melancholy" (Tuan 1964, 27). The resonances between ruins, landscape, and melancholy are intuited too in the landscapes of cities, with Smithson and Keiller both contemplating the place of ruins in their relative scenes. For Smith- son, it is the highway that appears as a ruin, where he could see Route 21 in the distance, alongside the Pas- saic River. Observing the processes of both bulldozing and construction of a "unitary chaos," Smithson had Bowring 219</page><page sequence="7">the realization that it was not something in a state of decay he was seeing, but "ruins in reverse" (Smithson 1967, 50). Smithson's reflection on the ambiguity of the ruin was that it was a construction yet to be built, the opposite of a romantic ruin, he believed, as "the build- ings don't fall into ruin after they are built but rather rise into ruin before they are built" (Smithson 1967, 50). Contemplating the site of the IRA bombings in the City, Keilleťs narrator is also confounded by the spec- tacle of incompletion. As the curtains in all the broken windows flap hypnotically in the breeze, and the piles of rubble look as much like materials yet to be utilized, the narrator muses that it is difficult to distinguish the bombing sites from the building sites "which had been so numerous just a few years before" (Keiller no date, line 6.2). Smithson's and Keilleťs ruins are paradoxical, in- verting the conventional appreciation of ruins simply as signals of time's passage. London and Passaic reveal how a scene in a state of incompleteness is ambiguous - is it falling down or being constructed? This temporal perplexity finds precedent in the aesthetic of the pictur- esque. As part of the cult of ruins, tumbled temples and towers were built within the 18th century gardens in the picturesque style. Yet, even here there was ambiguity in terms of their temporal state. The Philosopher's Temple in the Désert de Retz near Paris, for example, was built as a ruin by Monsieur de Monville. Nearby, at the con- temporaneous Ermenonville, the Temple of Philosophy was constructed in a manner that suggests a ruin, but was imagined by René de Girardin as something quite different: an incomplete building. Within the temple is inscribed, in Latin, "Be this temple (Unfinished like the science [philosophy] whose name it bears)" (Anony- mous in Girardin 1982/1783, 80). This allegory of the imperfection of human understanding is further repre- sented by the fact that although six whole pillars of the temple bear the names of philosophers (Newton, Des- cartes, Voltaire, Montesquieu, William Penn, and Rous- seau), a further column lies in the grass, bearing the phrase which asks "Who will complete it?" (Anonymous in Girardin 1982/1783, 81). A further three uninscribed columns lie on the ground, also evoking the sense of a temple under construction. Smithson's highway and Keilleťs piles of con- struction materials resonate with Girardin's incomplete temple, echoing his challenge to the idea of complete- ness. Incompleteness is one of melancholy's qualities, and while ruins in a state of decay might be one of the epitomes of melancholy landscapes, a structure in a suspended state of completion is also redolent with poignancy. Incompleteness is the resistance of clo- sure, the melancholic's wish to avoid the passing of sad- ness, the resolution of the problem, and the desire to "keep the wound open."11 5. Topophitia Bubbling below the surface in both London and Passaic is a sexualized sensibility. Robinson and the narrator, it is relayed, shared a 'bickering, sexual relationship', something that serves to add a further layer of engage- ment to the two men who at first appear simply friends or research colleagues. The sexuality is further em- bedded within the landscape, within the monuments themselves, with the love affair between Rimbaud and Verlaine monumentalized in the emphatically phallic Telecom Tower. Smithson also circles the sexual symbol- ism of the pipes in The Fountain Monument, recording that " [i]t was as though the pipe was secretly sodom- izing some hidden technological orifice, and causing a monstrous sexual organ (the fountain) to have an orgasm" (Smithson 1967, 50). Smithson then observes his own statement from a clinical distance, suggesting that "[a] psychoanalyst might say that the landscape displayed 'homosexual tendencies,' but I will not draw such a crass anthropomorphic conclusion. I will merely say, 'It was there.'" (Smithson 1967, 50). Love is a geomorphological force of sorts; it shapes the terrain. More specifically it might be termed a psy- chogeomorphological force, expressing the act of shap- ing the landscape through emotions and the mental state, or "subjective transformation" (Keiller 2000, 66), 220 Landscape Journal 30:2-11</page><page sequence="8">as a parallel to psychogeography's spatial mapping via playing mind against matter in the city. The embed- ding of affectivity, visceral sexuality, is not new in the representation of the landscape. Creation myths often imply a sexual union between earth and sky, and re- lated to this is one of the most pervasive metaphors for landscape - that of the landscape-as-body, most spe- cifically a female body. In the most familiar of terms for geographical features ("toe" of the slope, "shoulder" of the hill, "foot", "bowels", "heart", etc.), and in the analogies deployed to describe certain actions on the landscape ("rape" of the earth), the body is deeply em- bedded within the landscape. The Situationists extended the metaphor of the landscape as female, but took it a step further suggest- ing an affair with her. Tophophilia for the Situationists was not a simple affection for the landscape, but an at- traction of a far more sexualized nature. Asger Jörn and Guy Debord would use soft porn images of women in their collages relating to the fabric of the city. Debord suggested an urban drifter could "rape" the night streets of the East End, and a piece of Situationist-inspired graffiti in May '68 read "I came in the cobblestones" (in Sadler 1999, 80). There is also a melancholy of love implied in Smithson's and Keiller's documentations of love ob- jects in the landscape. Robert Burton, an early theorist of melancholy, identified "love melancholy" as a par- ticular species of melancholy and averred that the "last and best" cure for it is to let those afflicted "have their desire" (Burton 1857/1621, 547). To do so is, of course, to forfeit melancholy. And when the objects of love, the monuments to love affairs, the geo -erotic Fountain Monument, are located within the landscape they are essentially unobtainable: it is not possible to find clo- sure. There is an echo with John Wylie's discussion of the memorial benches at Mullion Cove, where he con- ceived of a geography of love, that had the message of the "impossibility of coinciding with landscape, of uni- fying the visible and the invisible, seer and seen, was in fact the precondition, the very possibility of all and any hopeful accounts of landscape and love" (Wylie 2009, 287). The melancholy dimension of this very impossi- bility is akin to the experience of deus absconditus, the grief of the missing, or literally "absconded," god. The individual has a deep love for that god, yet he is not present, and the full realization of that love is therefore impossible. This is a profoundly melancholy condition, and one that is echoed in the love of landscape, or the landscape as love. There is only so far one can go in such a relationship, and it must always be held in an incom- plete state. However, in the case of a relationship with a god who has gone, or an unrealizable lover such as the landscape, such a solution is not possible. This echoes the Freudian concept of the wound kept open, where the impossibility of closure is most precisely the condi- tion of melancholy. After all, to have one's desire would end the delicious pain of melancholy. The prolonging of longing, the attachment to the lost object, the creation of impossible scenarios such as the landscape as lover, or as love, is melancholy par excellence. CONCLUSION Through the close reading of two artworks that present themselves as documentations of place, a number of resonances are apparent. Orbiting around the investi- gations of an American suburban-scale city of the 1960s and a major European metropolis of the 1990s are parti- cles of a ver/ similar nature, and a vision of modernity's melancholy as productive of invention and imagining. In his work on the arcades, Benjamin's conception of melancholy was not as a pit into which society was fall- ing, but a means of revelation. Buck-Morss notes how, "whereas the Baroque dramas were melancholy reflec- tions on the inevitability of decay and disintegration, in the Passagen-Werk the devaluation of (new) nature and its status as a ruin becomes instructive politically." Thus, Buck-Morss goes on, "[t]he debris of industrial culture teaches us not the necessity of submitting to historical catastrophe, but the fragility of the social order that tells us this catastrophe is necessary. The crumbling of the Bowring 221</page><page sequence="9">monuments that were built to signify the immortality of civilization becomes proof, rather, of its transiency" (Buck- Morss 1989, 170). Within the vast and unforgiving wastelands of the late 20th century's urban areas, Keiller and Smithson locate fictional overlays which provide commentary, critique, and even an antidote to a simply nihilistic spe- cies of melancholy. The two superfictions' otherworldly perspectives can be seen as parallel examples of the re- vivification of otherwise apparently stagnant or barren landscapes. Elsewhere Keiller refers to the idea of "sub- jective transformation of the landscape," where, " [a] s in- dividuals, we can't rebuild the public transport system, or re-empower local democracy, but we can poeticize our relationship with their dilapidation" (Keiller 2000, 66). Such an imaginative, poeticizing, aestheticizing, response to the daunting prospect of modernity's mal- aise invokes a fruitful melancholy that differs sharply from an unproductive ennui. In proposing subjective transformations of cityscapes, Smithson and Keiller offer theoretical perspectives for landscape architec- ture, means of probing the exhausted settings of daily life, echoing Buck-Morss's observation of the Passagen- Werk that it illustrated how showing the "fleetingness of temporal power does not cause sadness; it informs political practice" (Buck-Morss 1989, 170). Melancholy, after all, is not merely sadness, but the seat of contem- plation and reflection. The interfacing of Smithson and Keiller introduces a new dialectic, a fresh frisson, that allows also for find- ing a new angle on Smithson's contribution to land- scape architecture. As Bargmann stated, it is not just in terms of sculpture, art theory, criticism, and photogra- phy that Smithson has had a profound influence, but in landscape too (Bargmann in Bargmann and Kane 1995, 99). Smithson has been mined by landscape ar- chitecture over the past few decades, most often as a environmental artist, where the scale and materiality of works like Spiral Jetty resonate with the discipline's sphere of practice (Hogue 2005; Howett 1998; Merrill 1991; Waldheim 1999). Smithson's Passaic work, to- gether with the vision of Patrick Keiller, is explored as a means of expanding this resonance with landscape architectural theory, presenting further possibilities for inter-disciplinary synergies. The juxtaposition of these two pieces, London and The Monuments of Passaic, exemplifies the potential of the sutures that operate in the subconscious, the in- voluntary stitching together of ideas and thought that occur when we are focused on other things. Like many revelations and epiphanies, the realization of the reso- nances of the two works came about while looking for something else. The serendipitous echoes slowly con- gealed, revealing greater depth on closer inspection. The resulting work is presented here in a way which foregrounds the apparatus, exposes the scaffold, upon which the revelations were placed. As in Benjamin's vast project, the framework is retained, laid bare as an organizing device, a set of categories, a series of index cards, an encyclopedia writ small. The five convolutes are offered as different views upon these two works, two places, and two times, providing constellations of ideas which create a prismatic view of the landscape. They aspire to a resuscitation and revivification of mel- ancholy as a critical dimension of the human condition. Aesthetic appreciation of the quotidian, the exhausted, and the abandoned, the wound kept open, challenges landscape architectural concerns with photogenic feel- good sites. Instead, these cities as revealed by Smithson and Keiller, and framed through the convolutes, em- brace melancholy as a deepening of our emotional rela- tionship with landscape.

Passagen-Werk and Passagenarbeit are alternative titles for Benjamin's mammoth project which has become known as The Arcades Project in English. Das Passagen-Werk was the invention of editor Rolf Tiederman, who transformed Ben- jamin's unfinished writing and notes into a book, first pub- lished in German in 1982 and in English in 1988. Richard Sieburth states that "Benjamin himself most frequently re- fers to it simply as his Passagen or Passagenarbeit, that is, as a passage or project. Tiederman's title, Das Passagen-Werk, is an editorial invention that runs the risk of reifying an ex- ploratory process of writing into an inert textual artefact" (Sieburth 1989, 26). 3. 'Close reading' is a term often now used in a generalized way to refer to the practice of reading passages in the mode of 'minute examination', as it was described by one of the original thêorists, I. A. Richards (2000). At its extreme, it be- came an almost mechanical form of analysis where a pas- sage is cleaved from its context, and is related to the practice of deconstruction. In its more moderate form close reading captures the idea of a carefully scrutinized and examined approach to a text - including other allied forms such as films. 4. 'Superfiction' is a term coined by artist Peter Hill in 1989, and refers to the process of using the visual and textual language of official institutions to frame invented, fictional institu- tions, events, or people. Hill's Art Fair Murders was both a novel and an installation that interwove fact and fiction (see P.W. Hill 1997). 5. For further discussion on linguistic and cultural colorings of melancholy, see (Jacky Bowring 2008), in particular Chapter 4, 'From Apea to Weltschmerz: A Lexicon of Melancholy.' 6. For a more in depth discussion of melancholy in art, see (Jacky Bowring 2008), in particular Chapter 5, 'A 'Blue' Guide: Melancholy in Cinema, Art, Literature, Music, Architecture and Landscape.' 7. Sisyphus, an ancient Greek, was given the punishment of rolling a rock to the top of the hill, only to watch it roll down again and then complete the task, for all of eternity. Albert Camus' The Myth of the Sisyphus captures the anguish of this predicament, "Again I fancy Sisyphus returning toward his rock, and the sorrow was in the beginning. When the images of earth cling too tightly to memory, when the call of happiness becomes too insistent, it happens that melan- choly rises in man's heart: this is the rock's victory, this is the rock itself. The boundless grief is too heavy to bear" (Camus 1991, 122). 8. Intertitles are the text slides which act as scene setters or captions in films. They were first used in silent films where they were often a surrogate for the spoke word, a kind of 'script' for the film. 9. Smithson also designated a number of other monuments besides those included in his short ArtForum article, such as the "cube monument" and "small fountain monument" (a drinking fountain). See, for example (Roberts 2004). 10. Smithson, it should be noted, had a certain skepticism of Duchamp, and sought, himself, to step outside the lineage that he termed "post-modern." He saw the readymade as lacking a dialectical dimension and was an avoidance - even a contempt - of 'work' in terms of artistic production. Smithson stated that he was not interested in the reiteration of the readymade. Yet, he also valorized the work of Dan Fla- vin, who produced "instant monuments" which rested upon the elevation of ordinary objects (for example, fluorescent light tubes) into assemblages of monumental status, (see Entropy and the New Monuments 1966 in Smithson 1996). While being conscious of the possible intellectual trespass of describing Smithson's work in a manner which may have been an anathema to him, this is also an act of defamiliar- ization in itself. The intention is, in part, to make Smithson's work strange through using the appellation of the ready- made in order to situate his practice of within the genre of transforming given items or scenes through their re -working or re-placement. 11. Freud drew a distinction between mourning and melancho- lia. The former is 'normal' grief, where one mourns and gets over something which is lost - be it a person, an idea, one's homeland. Melancholia, however, means that the griever does not recover, nor wishes to recover, and this is compared to a wound being kept open. Incompleteness in this sense is a profoundly melancholy state of being (see Freud 2005). REFERENCES Anonymous. 1982. A Tour to Ermenonville. In An Essay on Land- scape, R.L. Girardin, trans.
