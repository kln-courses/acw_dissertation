<plain_text><page sequence="1">60 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW oratorical practice. The discursive and allusive character of much of the argument, together with vocabulary which will be strange to many with words like ' metalanguage ' (ch. 6 passim) and statements like' Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' (138), make this a difficult book, but one with many rewards for the persevering reader.

Nesselrath's first txdya ,t,tt'ov (Lukians Parasitendialog, published as 22 in the same series in 1985, and reviewed by Bryan Reardon in this periodical in 1987, 159ff.) amply demonstrated his special endowments as a scholar: an enviable command of all the relevant literature, both ancient and modern; sound organisation of complex material; good judgement; and a terrier-like determination to follow every trail, however peripheral, to its extremity. The present work, a revised version of a Habilitationsschrift supervised by Rudolf Kassel and dedicated to him, reveals the same qualities. It discusses the period of Attic comedy between late Aristophanes and Menander, but is less a general survey than an exhaustive, penetrating and indispensable study of problems and typology. The first two sections of the book focus on the actual term 'Middle Comedy'. When was it first used as a label? And was it used to define a particular entity, different in theme and character from Aristophanes' Old and Menander's New Comedy, or did it represent merely a period of transition ? What were its chronological limits? N. argues that the term itself, whose first datable appearance is Zenobius Ath. 1.42 in the Hadrianic period, was most probably coined by Aristophanes of Byzantium in Hellenistic Alexandria. Before reaching this conclusion, N. examines at great length all the ancient evidence and all the modern scholarship from Scaliger to Janko. Here his negative arguments, with which he disposes effectively of rival theories (such as that most recently advanced by Janko, regenerating the claim that the Tractatus Coislinianus, with its closing reference to Middle Comedy [XVIII J.], is a garbled version of the second book of Aristotle's Poetics; N.'s analysis of the Coislin tractate highlights the ideas and expressions which conflict with Aristotle in the Poetics and elsewhere), seem more effective than the positive ones with which he sustains his own view. There is perhaps not enough evidence to link the term ' Middle Comedy' with Aristophanes of Byzantium rather than Callimachus or Eratosthenes or scholars working at Pergamum, although the assumption of a Hellenistic origin seems preferable to any other dating. The third section deals with the actual fragments of Middle Comedy, preserved mainly by Athenaeus. Here N. concentrates on themes and other features which he identifies as characteristic of Middle Comedy as a distinguishable entity. Using the (admittedly inadequate) statistical evidence of didascalia and existing play titles, he is able to show that myth plots (with or without tragic parody) flourished especially between 400 and 350 B.C. Oddly enough for a scholar so steeped in biblographies, N. ? Oxford University Press 1992</page><page sequence="2">61 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW makes little or no use here of T. B. L. Webster's Studies in Later Greek Comedy (Manchester 11953, 21970, index s.v. mythological comedy), nor does he bring into his discussions the vase-paintings of Magna Graecia, which are now recognised to portray (at least sometimes) scenes from Attic comedy. Yet N.'s conclusions seem well grounded, even though he does not'take cognisance of the fact that varying types and amounts of myth travesty and tragic or dithryrambic parody can be found in plays whose titles give no indication of this (e.g. Ar. Ach., Thesm., Plut., Men. Sik.). N. also emphasises the use made in Middle Comedy of passages in high-flown ' dithyrambic' language, spoken often by slaves or cooks, and in anapaestic dimeters; both may be designed to effect a contrast with the mundanity of their comic contexts, although the loss of those contexts makes any positive statement hazardous. N. finally deals with the apparently innovative use of certain type roles (such as parasites and cooks) in Middle Comedy. When dealing with the portrayal of the parasite in Alexis' Parasitos, N. still challenges (as in his earlier book) the view I took of Alexis' priority (GRBS 9 [1968], 161ff.), without attempting to confront the argument from the language of fr. 178.1-2 Kock and the Roman parallels. Synthesising all his arguments, discoveries and conclusions, N. plausibly claims that 380-50 B.C. was the core period of Middle Comedy, with transitional periods of from 20 to 30 years on both sides.

In poetry, gods are people too. Ancient epic, F. argues, was history - in their sense, not ours - adorned by myth. The mythical element came via the gods, conceived of in generic terms as anthropomorphic deities in the Homeric mould. These gods, of sheer necessity, function in epic as literary vehicles ('what else can they be?', p. 46), as characters no less than do the humans in the poems. Thus the plausibility of epic is as dependent on the success of the (avr'aafa, of the gods as agents in the narrative, as it is on what we perceive as ' realistic' action on the human plane. The difficulty is created by the gap between the gods as Homer presents them and later 'purer' ways of thinking about them, between the autonomy of poetry in choosing its means of representation and the realities of post-Homeric piety. The second chapter of F.'s study reveals an Apollonius self-consciously foregrounding the problem. For example, the famous scenes where the goddesses plot to ensnare Medea, and Eros hunts her down, are often praised for their psychological realism. Though Apollonius was aware of the 'naturalism' and exploited it, modern critics are misled by preconceptions of the nature of fiction which derive from seeing the novel as a standard. F. insists that not only must Eros' descent be seen in narrative terms ? Oxford University Press 1992</page></plain_text>
