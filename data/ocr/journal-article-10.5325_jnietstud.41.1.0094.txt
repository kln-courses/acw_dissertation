<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  Zarathustra Hermeneutics PAUL S. LOEB   Ia m honored to have this symposium dedicated to my study, and I would like to thank the participants for their extensive and thoughtful comments. Reading  the contributions together, I find a shared interest in my study’s hermeneutic  strategies and a shared skepticism regarding my study’s goal of offering a uni- fied, coherent, and solution-oriented reading of T hus Spoke Zarathustra . For  Stanley Rosen, Nietzsche’s book is instead an exoterically esoteric exercise in  self-contradictory poetry; for Tom Stern, it is a deflationary thought experiment;  and for Adrian Del Caro, it is an open-ended, ambiguous, and metaphorical  liberation from philosophy. Rosen offers what he thinks is a decisive exegeti- cal and philosophical argument in support of his alternative reading. This is the  same argument that he first proposed in T he Limits of Analysis and that he has  revisited many times in the thirty years since. So I will here refute Rosen’s argu- ment and with it his grounds for challenging the interpretive method of my study.  By contrast, Stern and Del Caro do not offer any specific argument, exegetical  or philosophical, in support of their alternative readings and write instead about  their strongly felt preference as to how Z  should be read. I myself do not have  any such personal preference. Instead, as Stern and Del Caro both note, my study  simply takes Nietzsche at his word and follows his own instructions as to how  his book should be read. By “instructions” I mean his suggestions, guidance,  comments, and warnings in his later books, especially in  Ecce Homo , but also in  his letters and sometimes, when confirming, in his unpublished notes. I think that  the evidence I present in my study shows that Nietzsche’s instructions rule out  the hermeneutic preferences of Stern and Del Caro. But both of them, especially  Stern, challenge some of this evidence, as well as my evidentiary standards, so  I will reply to these challenges as well.   Chaos and Creativity   Chaos lies at the heart of Rosen’s critique of my study, as well as of his own  engagement with Nietzsche’s Z  and with Nietzsche’s writings in general. More  specifically, Rosen finds the key to Nietzsche’s project in his conception of  the world as chaos and in his associated claim that the order and value human  beings find in the universe are in fact their own projected poetic creation.

This inconsistent and unstable position expresses itself in  Nietzsche’s double rhetoric: he o penly proclaims this conception of the world  as chaos so as to justify his liberationist call for life-affirming human creativity;  and he c onceals his conception of the world as chaos (even, and especially,  from himself) so as not to paralyze human creativity. Nietzsche is thus the  first to propose a transformation of the esoteric into the exoteric wherein the  former is no longer safeguarded by the latter but, rather, identified with it and  debased by it. Accordingly, the great obscurity of Z  “is due not so much to its  possessing a hidden meaning that requires elaborate decoding” but, rather, to  the fact that—since its esoteric teaching contradicts its exoteric teaching—“the  meaning is intentionally and necessarily self-contradictory.” Hence, Rosen  concludes, “the book implodes into chaos” (1995, 201–2).   The best and most important evidence cited by Rosen in support of this  argument is Nietzsche’s famous call in  The Gay Science 109 for a complete   de-deification of nature (Rosen 2000, 198n38; 2002, 197n25, 220n45). Here  we find, as Rosen says, Nietzsche openly asserting that the total character of  the world is in all eternity chaos ( der Gesammt-Charakter der Welt ist in alle  Ewigkeit Chaos ) and warning against the projection of our normative judgments  into this chaos. Contrary to Rosen, however, we do not find Nietzsche making  the further assertion that all such normative judgments are mere illusion. The  reason, Rosen (2009, 9–13) might argue, is that Nietzsche is here concealing  this discouraging aspect of his conception. But I think that the real reason is  that Nietzsche doesn’t believe this further assertion. In fact, I think that the rest  of the G S 109 passage explains why it would be a mistake to make this further  assertion.   Thus, having dismissed the idea that we can praise or reproach the uni- verse, Nietzsche warns against attributing to the universe heartlessness  ( Herzlosigkeit ) or irrationality (U nvernunft ). In a preparatory sketch for this  passage, Nietzsche writes that pessimists make precisely such reproachful  attributions and thereby denigrate the value of existence (K SA 14, p. 254). But  Rosen interprets Nietzsche as just such a pessimist when he (1995, xiii, 41, 59)  argues that according to Nietzsche all our moral and rational constructions  are mere illusions that disguise the underlying hostile and irrational chaos.  Indeed, Rosen writes that the inconsistency he finds in Nietzsche “expresses,  and is intended to express, the chaotic interior or ultimate origin” because “the  origin, as chaos, is self-contradictory in its ‘utterances’ ” (2000, 200). This is  why he writes in his review that Nietzsche contradicts himself each time he  opens his mouth to speak.  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   95 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> 96  PAUL S. LOEB  Even more explicitly, Nietzsche points out in G S 109 that once you know  that there are no purposes, you also know that there is no accident; for it is only  beside a world of purposes that the word  accident has meaning. But Rosen  writes that for Nietzsche “[h]aphazardness replaces purposiveness” (1995, 58),  and he argues that according to Nietzsche our purposes are illusions that mask  an underlying world of random fluctuations of chaos (Rosen 1995, xi, 13, 40,  74, 137, 190–91, 245–47). Thus, whereas Nietzsche warns against the projec- tion of  either opposing side of our praising and reproachful judgments, Rosen  continues to project the r eproachful judgments and from this projection derives  the illusory character of our p raising judgments. In an unpublished note written  in 1887, Nietzsche comments on this natural post-theistic tendency to replace the  former extreme position with an extreme o pposite position: “And so belief in the  absolute immorality of nature, in purposelessness and meaninglessness, is the  psychologically necessary a ffect once the belief in God and an essentially moral  order becomes untenable[....] O ne interpretation has collapsed; but because it  was considered t he interpretation it now seems as if there were no meaning at  all in existence, as if everything were i n vain ” ( KSA 12:5[71]; original emphasis;  see Rosen 1995, xiii; 2000, 203; 2002, 198–202). 1     It seems to me that Rosen misunderstands Nietzsche’s de-deification argu- ment in several crucial respects. First of all, he reverses the order of Nietzsche’s  argument. Nietzsche does not assert that the world is chaos and from this derive  the inapplicability of our normative judgments. Instead, he s ubtracts all of these  projected normative judgments one by one until he finally arrives at his con - clusion that the world is chaos. Second, Rosen misidentifies the kind of illusion  that is demonstrated by this argument. Nietzsche does not claim that the chaotic  nature of the universe renders all our normative judgments illusory. Instead, he  argues that we have so far lived under the illusion created by the m isapplication  of these judgments, namely, the illusion of an anthropomorphic universe. Third,  Rosen misinterprets the logic of Nietzsche’s argument. Nietzsche does not argue  that our normative judgments are false and distorting representations of the cha- otic world. Nor does he argue, as Rosen also claims (1995, 14, 32, 58, 144, 248;  2002, 202), that humans and their judgments are themselves just further mani- festations of this chaos. Instead, Nietzsche asserts that humans (along with their  properties, needs, and creations), organic life, the earth, and our astral order are  all inexpressibly l ate, rare , and a ccidental features of the world (see also B GE  36). He then argues against the tendency to make these features e ternal, univer- sal , and  essential and to posit these features generally and everywhere. But this  means that Nietzsche thinks that these features are entirely real and that they are  to be  contrasted ( dagegen ) with the  Gesammt-Charakter of the world. Although  our normative judgments are misapplied to the universe as a whole, they are  correctly applied to these ultra-exceptional features that constitute the world that  concerns human beings (d ie Welt, die den Menschen Etwas angeht [ GS 301]). JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   96 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="4">  ZARATHUSTRA HERMENEUTICS  97 Finally, Rosen misidentifies the source of Nietzsche’s disparaging tone in this  argument. He thinks that Nietzsche is disgusted by the ugly truth that all beauty,  wisdom, nobility, reason, and order is ultimately nothing but chaos. But in fact  Nietzsche is simply expressing his usual disgust at the modern tendency to reduce  everything that is rare and exceptional into something common and universal.  Calling the universe a machine, he writes, does it far  too much honor . Let us  beware, he writes, of positing everywhere else anything as e legant as the cyclical  movements of our neighboring stars. The whole music box eternally repeats its  tune—a tune that may never be called a m elody .   Nietzsche’s remark about eternal repetition brings me, finally, to Rosen’s  interpretation of eternal recurrence. According to Rosen, “[o]ne can speak of  eternity in Nietzsche’s thought only in the sense that Becoming is intrinsically  chaotic, and strictly speaking chaos is atemporal” (1995, 178). This means that  “[a]part from human intentional activity, there is no time” (Rosen 1995, 185).  But eternal recurrence is a teaching about time, either cosmological time or  historical time, and for Nietzsche “both cosmological and historical time are  intrinsically chaotic, both owe their respective order to the will of the human  beings who inhabit them” (Rosen 1995, 178 ff., 185). It follows that eternal  recurrence is “itself an illusion” and “an instrument for the enactment of the  will” (Rosen 1995, 181, 14). Hence, eternal recurrence cannot be a “philosophi- cal argumentation or scientific discovery” but only “prophetic rhetoric”: “It is  entirely erroneous therefore to attempt to analyze the inner conceptual structure  of the doctrine of eternal return as if it were a complex and harmonious set of  rational arguments, whether philosophical or scientific” (Rosen 1995, 14). This  is why Rosen says that there is no point in my study’s defense of the logical  coherence of eternal recurrence. Instead, he argues, we can only investigate the  ways in which Nietzsche intended eternal recurrence to function as a rhetorical  product of his will, as a noble lie, as a poetic myth, or as prophetic revelation.  Thus, responding, for example, to my claim that eternal recurrence entails an  embodied personal immortality (Loeb 2010, 82–83), Rosen argues that this could  never be a rational teaching but at most a kind of myth (see also 1995, 123).   I have already mentioned Nietzsche’s allusion in G S 109 to his doctrine of  eternal recurrence: d as ganze Spielwerk wiederholt ewig seine Weise . This allu- sion is important because it is Nietzsche’s first published reference to eternal  recurrence and because he includes it in the context of his call for a completely  de-defied nature. In this passage, then, Nietzsche is associating his conception  of the world as chaos with his doctrine of eternal recurrence and arguing that a  completely de-deified nature will include b oth these elements. As I explain in  my study, Nietzsche argues that if we reject the concept of a creator-God and  with it the covertly theological idea that the world has an origin or beginning,  we will see that the world is in fact an eternally self-creating o uroboros (Loeb  2010, 231). Since eternal recurrence is a doctrine about time, it follows that Rosen  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   97 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> 98  PAUL S. LOEB is mistaken in claiming the atemporality of Nietzsche’s chaotic world. Indeed,  as I argue in my study (2010, 52–54, 174), Zarathustra’s first speech on time  explains that the concepts of God and atemporality belong together, whereas  his post-theistic doctrine of eternal recurrence will be aligned with the reality of  time. Later, Zarathustra alludes to this same speech when he rejects the dwarf ’s  interpretation of eternal recurrence because it assumes a God’s-eye point of view  that denigrates time as lie and illusion. So when Rosen argues that Nietzsche  understood time and eternal recurrence as human constructs and illusions, he is  actually attributing to him the theistic interpretation that Nietzsche rejects.   Having thus refuted Rosen’s argument for the methodological intractability  of Nietzsche’s book and doctrine, let me correct a few of his misunderstandings  concerning the methodology of my study. By “doctrinal,” I mean having to do  with the content of Zarathustra’s teachings, and by “doctrinal approach,” I mean  an interpretive focus on this content. I do not mean, as Rosen thinks, logical or  conceptual analysis. Also, I only use these terms as applied to Nietzsche’s clue  that eternal recurrence is the G rundconception of his book. Thus, a doctrinal  approach to this clue assumes that Zarathustra’s teachings are grounded by  the thought of eternal recurrence. A more literary approach assumes that the  literary properties of Nietzsche’s book are grounded in the thought of eternal  recurrence. I don’t think that these approaches are mutually exclusive, but I do  think that the latter approach better explains what Nietzsche meant by his clue— namely, that he constructed the narrative of Zarathustra’s life so as to display  its eternal recurrence. Certainly, previous commentators have emphasized the  narrative of Nietzsche’s book, but as far as I know I am the first to explain  this performative function of the narrative. By G rundgedanke , then, I do not  mean, as Rosen thinks, some first principle or logical key. Here the confusion  is Rosen’s, not mine: I do not seek to defend the logical coherence of eternal  recurrence by an appeal to the narrative of Nietzsche’s book. My method is rather  to explain how Nietzsche’s doctrine has been greatly misunderstood and then  to show how a clearer understanding of this doctrine helps to solve the riddles  of Nietzsche’s book.   Part IV   Perhaps the most important and impressive of Nietzsche’s riddles is his   construction of four parts and two conclusions for his masterpiece. On my per- formative reading of Nietzsche’s G rundconception , Nietzsche shows us the  death of his protagonist at the end of part III, and this means that he wanted  us to notice the chronological anomalies in the structurally subsequent part IV  narrative where Zarathustra is depicted as having grown older. By contrast, as  Del Caro notes, commentators usually describe the odd features of part IV as  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   98 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="6">  ZARATHUSTRA HERMENEUTICS  99 by-products of Nietzsche’s unstructured writing process. This is why he says I may  be  overreaching when I claim that Nietzsche’s satyr play model led him to plan  precisely four parts for his book. Indeed, it has now become part of the scholarly  lore surrounding part IV that this was merely the first of several more parts that  Nietzsche planned to write and that the book’s current ending is unplanned and  accidental. However, it is simply not the case, as Del Caro claims, that Nietzsche  planned  different continuations of Z after part IV was completed and printed. In  fact, two days after he sent the printer a fair copy of what he called “the fourth  and last part of my  Zarathustra ” (12 March 1885,  KSB 7:19), Nietzsche told  his friend Köselitz that this was his book’s last part and finale (15 March 1885,   KSB 7:21)—exactly the same thing he had told his friend Gersdoff a month  earlier (12 February 1885,  KSB 7:9). These instructions accord with his earlier  plans for a fourth part and with his advice to Overbeck to read the just completed  second part as “a second part of f our ,” which together would constitute the whole  (9 November 1883, K SB 6:455).   Despite this strong direct evidence, commentators continue to claim that  Nietzsche planned to add further parts to Z  . They usually cite three differ- ent pieces of i ndirect evidence in support of this claim. The first of these,   emphasized by scholars like Del Caro and David Farrell Krell (1986, 68–87), is  that Nietzsche continued to write notes involving Zarathustra, which eventually  culminated in the last work he prepared for publication,  Dionysian Dithyrambs .  But this point is easily countered, since these notes do not include any men- tion of  additional parts for the completed and published Z  . The second piece  of evidence, and the main reason Del Caro and others claim that Nietzsche  planned further parts for his book  long after he completed part IV, in fact until  1888, is that during this year he described part IV to a few correspondents  as an interlude or  entre’acte ( Zwischenakt ,  Zwischenspiel [ KSB 8:228, 374]).  Following Kaufmann (1954, 344), commentators such as Laurence Lampert  (1986, 288–89, 313n8) have assumed that this meant an interlude in between the  whole of parts I–III, on the one hand, and further parts that he planned but did  not write, on the other. But I show in my study (2010, 88–89) that Nietzsche’s  exact wording—“zwischen Zarathustra und dem, was folgt”—rules out this  interpretation: what follows cannot be part of Z  and refers instead to his next  book, B eyond Good and Evil .   Finally, commentators point to some notebook plans contemporaneous  with the composition of part IV, and a few contemporaneous letters, in which  Nietzsche writes about a new book entitled N oon and Eternity that would include  what is now its fourth part as only its first part, with two further parts to follow.  However, as I explain in my study (2010, 89), Nietzsche told his friend Köselitz  in the same letter above that he had misled him about these plans and that they  were in fact merely a ruse intended to attract a publisher for part IV. A couple of  scholars have noted this crucial point (although not this key letter), and Nehamas  correctly observes that “the possibility of getting the whole [Z arathustra ] book  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   99 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> 100  PAUL S. LOEB published together by a new house depended on his convincing them there was  more to follow, since sales of the first three parts of Z arathustra had been  dismal”  (2000, 180n15; see also Pippin 1988, 67n8). But most scholars—including seri- ous archivists like Colli (K SA 14, p. 282) and Schaberg (1995, 101–3)—have  continued to take these fake plans seriously and to infer that Nietzsche planned  to write further parts in the future. I think that the main reason for this is that they  believe the conclusion of part IV is chronologically open-ended, so that it is easy  to imagine Nietzsche planning further adventures for his protagonist. But if my  reading of this conclusion is right, as Del Caro seems to concede in the second  half of his review, then this conclusion actually loops back into the end of part  III and into the chronological ending of the entire narrative where Nietzsche  has already staged the death of his protagonist. This, I claim, is why Nietzsche  told his sister that this fourth part was intended to help his son, Zarathustra, “to  get to his beautiful d eath ” ( KSB 6:557).   Tom Stern says that my solution to the problem of part IV is new and inter- esting, but he thinks that it does not sit very well with the opening sentence  of part IV in which Zarathustra is depicted as having grown old. However, he  misunderstands my solution when he says that I see the action of part IV as tak- ing place before that of part III. I actually claim that it takes place shortly before  the  ending of part III, within the implicit chronological ellipsis that Nietzsche  constructed between the third and sixth sections of the “Old and New Tablets”  chapter (Loeb 2010, 125). This gap, I argue, allows for years to go by and for  Zarathustra to grow old (in the usual sense) as he waits for the lion-and-doves  sign that his disciples have returned (Loeb 2010, 98–99, 123). So there is no  conflict at all, and indeed there is a natural continuity, with this chronological  gap being filled in by the three-day action of part IV that opens with a reference  to Zarathustra’s having grown old as he waits for this same sign (Loeb 2010, 99)  and that closes with the arrival of this same sign.   Gay Science 341 and Plato’s  Phaedo   Aside from his brief objection to my reading of part IV, Stern’s critical response  to my study dwells on my reading of  GS 341. In the first place, he argues, we  can simply sidestep my philosophical questions concerning the deterministic  and fatalistic aspects of eternal recurrence. The key, he says, is to focus on the  diagnostic function of eternal recurrence and to reject the common assumption  that Nietzsche was interested in the transformative effects of his teaching.  Stern’s term a ssumption suggests some unstated background conviction that  is not supported by anything Nietzsche actually says. But in fact Nietzsche  frequently emphasized the extraordinary transformative effects that his doc- trine had on him and would have on the human race (Loeb 2010, 12). And  even in  GS 341, which is the only textual evidence Stern considers, Nietzsche  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   100 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="8">  ZARATHUSTRA HERMENEUTICS  101 writes that if this thought gained possession of you, it would transform you as  you are or perhaps crush you, and that the question in each and every thing,  “Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?” would lie upon  your actions as the greatest weight. This emphasis on the transformative and  burdensome aspects of eternal recurrence is carried over into  Z , especially  in the “Vision and Riddle” chapter, where Zarathustra has a prevision of  crushing his archenemy with the great weight of his thought and then being  transformed into a figure that is no longer human. In my study, I show how  this prevision is fulfilled in the final chapters of part III, where Zarathustra is  so deeply affected by eternal recurrence that he falls down as if dead, remains  unconscious for seven days, and then, as I argue, actually dies. Stern doesn’t  consider these final chapters at all, but I don’t see how he could deny that  Nietzsche is here depicting the profound spiritual transformation undergone  by Zarathustra as a result of having awakened and confronted his thought of  eternal recurrence.   As for Stern’s emphasis on the diagnostic function of Nietzsche’s doctrine,  I  would ask why we should care whether someone fails the test of eternal recur- rence and reveals (as Stern says) his belief in a fictional world beyond our own  in which to live out his fantasy existence. If, as Stern thinks, eternal recurrence  is not supposed to be true, then this test simply pits one metaphysical fantasy  against another, and b oth demonstrate a refusal to affirm this nonrecurring life  as it actually is. But if, as I argue in my study, eternal recurrence is supposed  to be true, then this test is indeed significant, but now we cannot sidestep the  relevant philosophical questions. And here I would simply note that the strong  intuitions Stern feels on behalf of Aaron Ridley’s objections simply do not take  into account the novelty of Nietzsche’s position—in particular, as my study  (2010, 29) argues, his proposal of a circular and relational time that dissolves  the traditional asymmetry between a determining past and a determined present.  Also, in citing the skepticism about deliberative action that Nietzsche pres- ents throughout his career, Stern declines to investigate what I have argued is  Nietzsche’s new and distinctive account of backward-willing freedom (Loeb  2010, 179 ff., 220–26).   Stern is most skeptical about my interpretive emphasis on the role of Plato’s  Socrates in Nietzsche’s Z  . He claims that I misread G S 340–42 and that this  misreading compromises my ensuing interpretation of the “Vision and Riddle”  chapter in Z  . On the basis of these assessments, Stern concludes that my study’s  general evidentiary standards are inferior and idiosyncratic. I will discuss  each of these points in turn. In the first place, Stern’s claim that I have mis- read G S 340–42 is overstated. For he criticizes only my continuous reading of   GS 340–41 and does not consider at all my very closely related interpretation of   GS 342. This is an important omission because I read the three sections as a nar- rative and philosophical unit: Socrates in G S 340 is contrasted with Zarathustra  in  GS 342, and this contrast is mediated by the doctrine of eternal recurrence  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   101 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="9"> 102  PAUL S. LOEB in  GS 341. Without  GS 342, I would not have looked for a continuity between  GS 340 and G S 341, and I would not have carried my exegesis of  GS 340–41  over into the “Vision and Riddle” chapter of Z  .   Stern’s critique of my unified reading of G S 340–41 consists of three points.  The first has to do with my observation that G S 341 includes an odd vagueness  in the timing of the demon’s announcement, namely as arriving some day or  night ( eines Tages oder Nachts ). I suggest that this vagueness may refer to the  idea that death can come at any time and that it constitutes textual evidence for  reading G S 341 as continuing the theme of the moment of death introduced in   GS 340. Having selected this particular suggestion, Stern lets loose a flurry of  strong critical comments: he says that interpretive claims like this are rather  weak, he questions my tendency to assume that readers are on board with these  kinds of inferences, he asks readers to decide for themselves what standards  of evidence they should adopt instead of mine, and he then later refers back to  this case as calling into question my evidentiary standard with respect to later  interpretive claims. That is a lot to hang on a single sentence, and it seems to  me that Stern has a tendency to exaggerate the force of his criticisms. In any  case, Stern fails to see that this particular interpretive claim is part of a larger  argument in which I canvass the various G S 341 temporal references in order  to show that they point back to the G S 340 concern with Socrates’s moment of  death. Stern also fails to see that this larger argument has a structure in which  I first emphasize Nietzsche’s use of the word A ugenblick in both G S 340 and   GS 341 and only afterward turn to mention five other potentially confirming  temporal clues—one of which is the vagueness of day or night. Finally, Stern  doesn’t see that this larger argument is followed by a second argument that  includes a canvassing of poetic death imagery in G S 341. In this second argu- ment, I point out that the image of moonlight does not f it a literal interpretation  of e ines Tages oder Nachts . In short, Stern simply extracts a single interpretive  claim out of a carefully elaborated argumentative structure and then dismisses  its isolated evidentiary value. He further reveals his selective and reductive  exegetical approach when he says that my discussion cites many other such  pieces of evidence and then alludes to Wittgenstein’s joke about two copies of  the same newspaper not providing twice the evidence.   Stern’s second critical point concerns my observation that in  GS 340 Nietzsche  seems to express some doubt about what caused Socrates to loosen his tongue at  the moment of death: “War es nun der Tod oder das Gift oder die Frömmigkeit  oder die Bosheit — irgend Etwas löste ihm in jenem Augenblick die Zunge und  er sagte: ‘Oh Kriton, ich bin dem Asklepios einen Hahn schuldig.’ ” I  suggest  that Nietzsche is thereby inviting his readers to consider that the G S 341 demon’s  revelation of eternal recurrence was actually the true cause. Stern finds this  suggestion unconvincing and wonders again about my standards of evidence.  But he also once again strips my interpretive claim of its argumentative context.  Stern focuses on my phrase “we may infer” and says that I interpret Nietzsche  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   102 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="10">  ZARATHUSTRA HERMENEUTICS  103 as inviting us to conclude, with certainty, about the true f ifth cause. I don’t  actually do this. Immediately after suggesting this p ossible inference, I go on  to argue that it is supported by three important pieces of textual evidence (Loeb  2010, 37). Stern doesn’t mention any of these supporting items or even seem  to notice that I go on to support my inference, thus leaving the impression that  I am simply making what he later calls an interpretive leap of faith, that is, a  rapid, speculative, and idiosyncratic interpretive move.   Stern’s third and final critical point is according to him the most decisive.  According to Stern, and contrary to my unified reading of G S 340–41, Nietzsche  could not have been suggesting that Socrates experienced a deathbed revela- tion of being trapped within life’s eternal recurrence. This is because the dying  Socrates asked for a sacrifice to be made to the god of health, and this meant that  he believed he had gotten better from the sickness that is life, that is, escaped  it. My response is that Stern is here (and also in 2009, 104) assuming Plato’s  interpretation of Socrates’s dying words: they were truthful words uttered in  a calm and peaceful state of mind; they were meant genuinely, sincerely, and  piously; and they were meant to convey the actual reality in which Socrates  found himself. As I argue in my study, however, Nietzsche’s whole point in   GS 340 is to expose and undermine Plato’s interpretation of Socrates’s dying  words. Socrates, he writes, had lived his entire life with a cheerful and stoic  mien, while all along concealing his inmost feeling of suffering from life. But,  then, at the moment of death, something happened to make him loosen his  tongue and reveal this inmost feeling. Socrates’s last words, Nietzsche claims,  were actually an expression of his suffering state of mind, and they demon- strated his sudden despair and abandonment of his lifelong cheerful and stoic  demeanor. These last words were veiled (v erhüllten ) and not what they seemed.  They were actually blasphemous, ridiculous, terrible, and lacking in an ounce  of magnanimity. What Socrates intended with these last words was revenge on  the life from which he suffered, and he accomplished this by communicating to  his disciples a veiled and coded condemnation of life. According to Nietzsche,  then, Socrates’s dying words did not mean that he believed he had gotten better  from the sickness of life and they did not reflect his experience of a final death  or escape to a better afterlife.   I conclude that Stern has not shown the failure of my unified reading of   GS 340–42 and that he is therefore not entitled to dismiss it as part of the  foundation for my subsequent reading of the “Vision and Riddle” chapter in Z  .  His brief summary of this subsequent reading is very inadequate, so I would  ask readers to look for themselves at my actual argument in chapter 3. I find it  interesting that Stern expresses some embarrassment about his discussion hav- ing gotten a little too hung up on the level of “minor” detail at which my study  is working. Actually, he didn’t get hung up nearly enough on this level, but in  any case his reluctance dovetails with Del Caro’s complaint that my reading  of  Z is hyperclose and perhaps too close. I am reminded yet again that many  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   103 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="11"> 104  PAUL S. LOEB Nietzsche scholars have not yet begun to think of their interpretive work as  requiring the kind of slow, patient, careful, detailed philological attention that  Nietzsche himself requested (D  P:5;  GM P:8) and that is completely standard  in the rest of the history of philosophy.   Del Caro is also skeptical of the intertextual connections I find between  Nietzsche’s Z  and Plato’s P haedo . But he doesn’t address the extensive evidence  I present showing such connections in G S 340–42 and in the “Vision and Riddle”  chapter of Z  . Nor does he present any evidence of his own to substantiate his  preferred connections to Christ in these same passages. In addition, my study  shows how eternal recurrence functions in the first instance as a counterdoc- trine to Plato’s afterlife doctrine, not to Christ’s. The reason is that Nietzsche  regards Christianity as a Platonism for the masses and thinks that Christianity’s  afterlife doctrine was derived from Plato’s—which itself was conceived as a  means to conceal and falsify the Dionysian mystery cult doctrine of eternal  recurrence (Loeb 2010, 38–41, 82–83). Finally, as for Del Caro’s objection to  my claim that Zarathustra uses Socratic reasoning against his Socratic archenemy  in the “Vision and Riddle” chapter, Del Caro (2002, 265) himself emphasizes  Nietzsche’s decision to call his protagonist “Zarathustra” in order to show him  using Zoroaster’s own method of truthfulness against him. So why should he  object to my interpretive claim that Nietzsche uses the same literary strategy  with Socrates?   Readers, Disciples, and Philosophers   In his response to my study, Del Caro expresses his conviction that Nietzsche’s   Z , for all its riddles and hermetic qualities, is an open book, one of the most  open books of all time, and should be read as such. So he worries that my focus  on solving the riddles of Z  has a closed and closing tendency. As I understand  his discussion, this worry seems to be motivated by three separate claims: that  there are necessarily different solutions for different readers of Z  , that disciple- ship is rejected in Z  , and that works of art like Z  do not admit of philosophical  resolution. I will discuss each of these points in turn. In the first place, Del Caro  seems to object to my claim to offer c orrect solutions to the riddles of  Z . With  his background in Germanist studies and literary criticism, Del Caro seems to  subscribe to the assumptions of reader-response theory. He describes Z  as an  interactive sounding board that encourages an active relationship between the  text and its readers, and he cites his essay “Facing Zarathustra,” which concludes  with a classic reader-response manifesto: “Instead, in the space that opens up  between Nietzsche’s inspiration and the critics’ speaking back to Zarathustra,  a transforming image of Zarathustra shapes and reshapes itself, assuming new  meaning for each new critical inquiry, and adopting new features as they are  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   104 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="12">  ZARATHUSTRA HERMENEUTICS  105 added on by the critics” (2002, 283). Del Caro’s point, then, is that my  interpretive  approach closes down the open space in which other readers can interact with  Z in their own and different ways.   As I understand Del Caro’s position, he seems to think that this is how  Nietzsche himself intended his text to be read. For other reader-response  theorists  who deny the relevance or even intelligibility of any concept of authorial inten- tion, this is an untenable position. Yet Del Caro alludes often and in detail to  Nietzsche’s authorial intentions and often praises my study for having more  correctly understood these intentions. I don’t think that Del Caro can have it  both ways: either there is simply no correct interpretation of Nietzsche’s book,  only different readers’ responses to it; or there is a correct interpretation, and in  order to find it we need to postulate Nietzsche’s authorial intentions and attempt  to follow his hermeneutic instructions. My study follows the second of these  interpretive strategies, but it seems to me that Del Caro inconsistently tries to  follow them both. Of course, it’s possible for Del Caro to argue that Nietzsche  himself intended his text’s meanings to be constructed by his readers. But, then,  is this intention something that could not have been constructed by his book’s  readers? And, besides, what is Del Caro’s evidence for ascribing such an autho- rial intention to Nietzsche?   By contrast, when I strive in my study correctly to understand Z  , I am pursu- ing a hermeneutic strategy that Nietzsche himself recommends for all his works  and especially for his favorite book,  Z . This general recommendation becomes  especially clear toward the end of his career when he says at the start of E H that  it is his duty to exclaim, “Hear me! for I am such and such a person. Above all,  do not mistake me for someone else!” and when he signs off at the end of this  same work, “Have I been understood?” As applied to  Z , this recommendation is  also especially clear in E H when he chastises scholarly oxen for misunderstand- ing his book’s concept of the superhuman; wonders why he hasn’t been asked  about the name “Zarathustra”; spends page after page explaining the origin,  meanings, and significance of his book; bemoans the lack of good readers for  his book; and despairs over how long it will take before his book is properly  understood. I think it is very difficult to square this extremely defensive and  possessive authorial stance with Del Caro’s suggestion that Nietzsche intended  readers of  Z to construct their own individual meanings. For example, why  aren’t scholarly oxen entitled to their Darwinist reading of the  Übermensch ?  Nietzsche’s answer is, because they are wrong, and it seems to me that we need  to heed these kinds of instructions.   This brings me to Del Caro’s worry about what he calls my elevation of  Zarathustra’s disciples. He is right to say that I attribute a far greater presence  and importance to the disciples than any other scholar to date. And he is right to  say that I part company with scholars like Robert Pippin who aim to downplay  this presence and significance. Del Caro’s reason for thinking that Nietzsche  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   105 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="13"> 106  PAUL S. LOEB has Zarathustra speak against the cultivation of disciples is the farewell speech  at the end of part I:  Now I go alone, my disciples. You too go now, alone. Thus I want it.   Verily, I counsel you: go away from me and resist Zarathustra! And even  better:  be ashamed of him! Perhaps he deceived you. [...]   One repays a teacher badly if one always remains nothing but a pupil. And  why do you not want to pluck at my wreath?   You revere me; but what if your reverence tumbles one day? Beware lest a  statue slay you!   You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra? You are  my believers—but what matter all believers!   You had not yet sought yourselves: and you found me. Thus do all believers;  that is why all faith amounts to so little.   Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves[....] (Z  :I “Gift-Giving Virtue” 3)   Del Caro doesn’t actually cite or quote this farewell speech, but his remarks  allude to it (see also Pippin 2006, xxxii). Having identified the readers of Z   with Zarathustra’s disciples, Del Caro says that we are not supposed to follow  him so much as we are supposed to use him to find ourselves. Hence, he claims,  if we accept my study’s elevation of Zarathustra’s disciples, we will lose the  sense in which Nietzsche’s book is an interactive sounding board, an active  relationship between text and reader in which readers are challenged to overcome  Zarathustra and his teachings.   I agree with Del Caro that Nietzsche intended the readers of his book to iden- tify with Zarathustra’s disciples (J ünger ). But I think that he, Pippin, and many  others misinterpret the above quote. Zarathustra is not criticizing discipleship  as such, only  false or  inauthentic discipleship. Because his students have not  yet sought themselves, they have not yet become self-directed. So far they have  needed to receive all their direction from Zarathustra, and this means that they  are still mere believers, the faithful, or ones who have faith ( Gläubige ). They  revere him, have faith ( Glaube ) in him, and unquestioningly accept whatever  he teaches them (Z  :II “Way of the Creator”). So Zarathustra instructs them  to leave him so that they can find themselves and become self-directed. He  instructs them to resist him, to become suspicious of him, and to become more  than just his pupils. Notice, however, that Zarathustra  instructs his disciples  to leave him and stop idolizing him and that their true devotion to him will be  demonstrated by their ability to f ollow this instruction. Notice also that the   reason Zarathustra instructs them to do this is that mere reverence and faith  amount to so little and cannot be counted on. Mere reverence, he suggests, will  eventually fade, and when it does, his believers will become cowardly apostates.  Teachers like Zarathustra should therefore not bind their hearts to such mere  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   106 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="14">  ZARATHUSTRA HERMENEUTICS  107 believers (Z  :III “Apostates” 1). But those who pass this test will find even more  reason than before to attach themselves to him, they will self-directedly choose  to follow him, and their loyalty will be dependable and really matter. These  will be his rightful companions, the ones whose obeying ears will listen to him  ( Z :IV “The Sign”). These will be the true and genuine disciples upon whom  Zarathustra will bestow his true love. This is why Zarathustra goes on to say  in the same passage (though this is usually not quoted): “and only when you  have all denied me will I return to you. Truly, my brothers, with different eyes  shall I then seek my lost ones; with a different love shall I then love you. And  once again you shall become my friends and children of a single hope.” And,  indeed, in the following chapter, at the start of part II, after years have gone  by, Zarathustra realizes that his teachings are in danger, and he rushes out to  reclaim his disciples. The disciples’ denial of Zarathustra is thus merely a first  step on the way to their further and complete initiation at his hands in part II  and also, I argue, at the end of part III (Loeb 2010, 128–38).   I think that this fuller and more accurate exegesis of Zarathustra’s farewell  speech justifies my study’s elevation of Zarathustra’s disciples. Of course,  Nietzsche’s book can still be interpreted as an interactive sounding board, as an  active relationship between text and reader. But contrary to Del Caro, Nietzsche  is not asking his book’s readers to use Zarathustra to find themselves or to  overcome Zarathustra and his teachings. Instead, Nietzsche is challenging his  readers to find themselves and to question and resist what they are reading,  so that eventually they will be in a better position to understand and follow  Zarathustra and his teachings.   Del Caro’s other reason for protesting my elevation of Zarathustra’s disciples  is that he thinks I have a tendency to make them into r eligious disciples. This  was certainly not my intent, and besides my references to Nietzsche’s pervasive  New Testament allusions, I am not sure why Del Caro thinks this. Just before  citing Zarathustra’s same farewell speech, Nietzsche comments that Zarathustra  does not preach or demand faith and that Zarathustra says precisely the opposite  of what some sage, saint, or world-redeemer would say in the same situation  ( EH  P:4). This shows, I think, that Nietzsche identifies  religious disciples as  believers (as those who have faith) and that he imagines Zarathustra’s t rue  disciples in completely nonreligious terms. In the last chapter of E cce Homo ,  Nietzsche says that he himself is no founder of religions, that he doesn’t want any  believers, and that he is too malicious to have faith in himself ( EH “Destiny” 1).  Del Caro also raises the related question of whether I think Nietzsche conceived  eternal recurrence as a religious doctrine. But I don’t agree with his suggestion  that Nietzsche planned to have the test of eternal recurrence take the place of  faith, and I certainly don’t think that Nietzsche intended eternal recurrence to  be accepted on faith. Instead, I argue, Nietzsche believed that we could come  to know the truth of his doctrine by recovering our suppressed memories and  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   107 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="15"> 108  PAUL S. LOEB I claim that the plot of his book turns upon the crucial event of Zarathustra’s  own such awakening and enlightenment. I do not say that Zarathustra teaches  eternal recurrence to his disciples or that they somehow come to have faith in  eternal recurrence on the basis of his teaching. On the contrary, I argue that  Zarathustra deliberately refrains from teaching his disciples eternal recurrence  and instead teaches this only to his own soul. Zarathustra’s true, self-directed  disciples must wait until they are strong enough to recover their own buried  memories of life’s recurrence and thereby teach themselves this mightiest of all  thoughts (Loeb 2010, 141–44).   The last reason Del Caro seems to offer for saying that my study has a clos- ing tendency is that it takes a  philosophical approach to Nietzsche’s work—in  the sense that it seeks to clarify and reveal what is hidden in this work. But this,  he claims, is to ignore Z  ’s status as a work of art and literature and to ignore its  effectiveness in steering a course different from philosophy and liberating its  readers from the philosophers. This would be a significant objection, especially  since a chief aim of my study is to show the integration of  Z ’s literary and philo- sophical aspects. However, the source of this objection is Pippin’s distinction  between literature as preserving hidden meanings and philosophy as purporting  to reveal what is hidden. And I am not at all persuaded that Nietzsche objected  to such a philosophical task. Indeed, I would argue that Nietzsche spent most  of his philosophical career trying to reveal what was hidden. I would also argue  that Pippin (2010, xiv–xv) is projecting back into Nietzsche’s book a twentieth- century complaint about philosophy that derives from the later Wittgenstein. But  Wittgenstein was a fundamentally Christian thinker who objected to philosophy  as a prideful enterprise and he should be regarded as Nietzsche’s antipode. I  also think that Pippin and Del Caro are projecting back into Nietzsche’ book a  twentieth-century concern with literary meaning. This becomes evident, I think,  when Pippin claims that the text “On Parables,” by that “Nietzschean” author  Kafka, might serve as a commentary on the antiphilosophical point of the liter- ary aspects of Z  . Pippin argues that Nietzsche’s parabolic and highly figurative  language is an attempt “to resist incorporation into traditional philosophy, to  escape traditional assumptions about the writing of philosophy” (2006, xii). But  the far plainer and simpler truth is that this language is modeled upon that of  the Bible, the most famous and analyzed book in Western history. Like Jesus  in the New Testament, Zarathustra does not simply explain his complex and  profound teachings but instead uses metaphorical, parabolic, and figurative lan- guage to help his disciples understand these teaching in terms of their ordinary  experience. In the book he called a fifth Gospel, Nietzsche shows Zarathustra  teaching by means of naturalistic images, figures, and metaphors because this  is what Jesus did. And I would argue that Nietzsche wants his meanings to be  found just as much as the authors of the biblical Gospels wanted their meanings  to be found.  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   108 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="16">  ZARATHUSTRA HERMENEUTICS  109  Memento Mori   I will close with my response to Del Caro’s misgivings about my study’s focus  on the themes of death and suicide. Del Caro feels that the focus of my study is  morbid and ruins the joyful, salutary, and life-affirming aspects of Nietzsche’s  book. According to Del Caro, Nietzsche was a spokesman for life and therefore  chose to dwell on life instead of death, on how to live instead of how to die. This  is why he invented a protagonist who, unlike Socrates and Jesus, lives for his  beliefs instead of dying for them. So he thinks that I have assimilated Nietzsche  too much to the Platonic and Christian life-denying approaches by writing about  Zarathustra’s death in a way that closely parallels the deaths of Socrates and  Jesus. He also claims that I have transformed Nietzsche from an antiromantic  to a death-seeking romantic by drawing on Wagnerian motifs that support my  thesis regarding Zarathustra’s death.   Since I claim that Nietzsche’s Z  is a book about death, I certainly do think  that he had in mind Wagner’s ideas about death, just as he had in mind those  of Empedocles, the Dionysian cults, Plato, the New Testament, Goethe,  Schopenhauer, and so on. But I argue that Nietzsche aimed to oppose and  reverse most of these ideas, especially Wagner’s romantic death-longing  ( Todessehnsucht [Loeb 2010, 171–72]). There are two background assump- tions in Del Caro’s critique that I find simplistic and contradicted by his own  commentary elsewhere. The first is that Nietzsche regards any celebration of  death or suicide as morbid, life denying, or romantic. However, in his definitive  account of romanticism ( GS 370), Nietzsche argues that everything depends on  the source of this celebration—whether this is suffering from a superabundance  of life or suffering from an impoverishment of life. The former, he says, leads to  a life-affirming celebration, while the latter leads to a life-denying celebration. In  my study I argue that Nietzsche depicts the postconvalescent Zarathustra’s great  longing for death, his self-sacrifice, and his deathbed celebration as all having  their source in his overripe suffering from a s uperabundance of life. These are  therefore all life-affirming phenomena. Del Caro himself admits this need for  what Nietzsche calls “a dual interpretation” (z wiefachen Interpretation ) when he  (1989, 223–32) writes elsewhere that Nietzsche’s philosophy of life affirmation  requires him to posit an antiromantic Dionysian notion of death that will liberate  human beings from morbidity.   Del Caro’s second assumption is that any close juxtaposition of Nietzsche’s  ideas with those of his antagonists has a tendency to assimilate the former to the  latter. But Nietzsche baptizes his protagonist with the name “Zarathustra” so  as to show his self-overcoming (E H “Destiny” 3); he uses Socrates’s own dia- lectical weapons against him in the “Vision and Riddle” chapter; and he inverts  Wagner’s P arsifal story about compassion in part IV (Hollinrake 1982, 121–71).  As Del Caro himself emphasizes elsewhere, one of Nietzsche’s favorite stylistic  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   109 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="17"> 110  PAUL S. LOEB  strategies is to mimic the words, thoughts, symbols, plots, themes, and methods  of his opponents in order to subject these to criticism, parody, reversal, inver- sion, and self-cancellation. I think that my study of Z  provides compelling evi- dence that he applied this same strategy to his opponents’ treatments of death  and suicide. So the question is why talented and insightful interpreters like Del  Caro have not recognized this before. His reason is telling and probably shared  by others: he has always admired Nietzsche as a spokesman of life, so he was  disinclined to find such thanatic themes in Nietzsche’s favorite and most life- affirming book. Nevertheless, as I mentioned above, Del Caro acknowledges  elsewhere that Nietzsche posited a new and life-affirming concept of death,  and in several places he explains this concept by closely juxtaposing it with  the Christian concept of death. In particular, Del Caro writes about Nietzsche’s  contrast between “the different kind of martyrdom each [Dionysus and Christ]  represents”—that is, between the dismemberment death of Dionysus and the  crucifixion death of Christ: “In this juxtaposition one recognizes Nietzsche’s  vitalistic constant: abundance and strength are symptoms of ascending vitality,  so that the death symbolized by the dismembered Dionysus is an expression  of lust for more of this life, while on the other hand, paucity and weakness as  symptoms of declining life result in a death that redeems us of this life” (1998,  82; see also 1989, 229).   Leaving aside these background assumptions, Del Caro points to the more  precise source of his misgivings when he mentions Nietzsche’s concept of   memento vivere ( HL 8). For Del Caro, this concept, with its opposition to the  Christian m emento mori , is the key to understanding Nietzsche’s “reorientation  toward death and dying” (2004,70) as well as his critique of the romantics’ mor- bid preoccupation with death and dying (1989, 223–28). As Del Caro writes:  “There can be little opportunity to practice immanent living if the hour of one’s  death is regarded with anticipation and reverence while one’s entire life is lived  in the shadow of this moment.... Nietzsche robs the concept of death of any  dignity, of any power, and he so diminishes its capacity to intimidate and haunt  humans that one could even say death is not a factor anymore, or, not t he factor  anymore” (2004, 70–71). But this analysis conflicts with my study’s claim that  Nietzsche places an extraordinary emphasis on the moment of death—as the site  of a world-historic agon between Socrates and Zarathustra, as the  Augenblick  when eternal recurrence is revealed, and as the occasion of Zarathustra’s third  spiritual transformation and backward-willing affirmation. On my reading, that  is, Nietzsche devises a new kind of m emento mori and invests the concept of  death with great dignity and power. Death may not be t he factor anymore, but  it is certainly a crucial factor, and Nietzsche even seems to have enhanced the  capacity of death to intimidate and haunt life-impoverished Socratic types.   In defense of my reading, I would note first of all that Del Caro’s  interpretive  approach derives from a single brief passage in Nietzsche’s early essay on  history.  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   110 4/21/11   11:47:03 AM </page> <page sequence="18">  ZARATHUSTRA HERMENEUTICS  111 Del Caro (1989, 223) asserts that Nietzsche never changed this position, but he  doesn’t offer any textual evidence to support this assertion, and my study of   Z offers a lot to contradict it. A more balanced interpretation shows that in  his later career Nietzsche developed a dual interpretation even with respect  to the hour of death. Outside of G S and  Z , the strongest evidence for this is in   Twilight of the Idols , where Nietzsche contrasts, on the one hand, the hour of  death that was turned by Christianity into a wretched and revolting comedy  and, on the other hand, the hour of death that is freely chosen and accomplished  at the right time, brightly and cheerfully, amid children and witnesses, with a  true farewell that includes a summation of the life, achievements, and aspira- tions ( TI “Skirmishes” 36). On my reading of Nietzsche’s book, the second of  these scenarios is precisely how he depicts Zarathustra’s hour of death (Loeb  2010, 136). Indeed, Nietzsche’s emphasis on the free choice involved in plan- ning the hour of death shows that his dual interpretation extends even to the  concept of suicide. For having declared that so-called natural death is actually  a kind of suicide, Nietzsche contrasts the coward’s suicide performed at the  wrong time with the courageous, timely suicide performed out of the love of life  ( TI “Skirmishes” 36; see also Loeb 2008, 167 ff.).   Against this rebuttal, Del Caro would most likely point to his further claim  that Nietzsche’s later doctrine of eternal recurrence is a renewed and stronger  expression of his early critique of  memento mori . According to Del Caro,  Nietzsche posited this later doctrine in order “to shift focus from morbid antici- pation and its resulting ‘cure,’ that is, the hereafter, to the here and now,” and  in order to vanquish death by showing that it is “but a moment, dissolved in  the eternal cycle”: “Death is only a moment in a human life as long as there  is no threat of punishment in hell and no promise of reward in heaven” (1989,  227–28). Given eternal recurrence, death no longer serves as “the threshold to  a higher life or immortality” or as “a catalyst or trigger for the alleged experi- ence of the afterlife” (Del Caro 2004, 70–71).   I agree of course with Del Caro’s claim that Nietzsche thought eternal recur- rence excluded any possible hereafter, heaven or hell, or higher life. Zarathustra  states this explicitly when he says that he will come again, not to a new life or to  a better life but to the identical and self-same life (Z  :III “Convalescent” 2). Hence  I agree with Del Caro as well that Nietzsche believed his doctrine excluded the  concept of death as a t hreshold to a higher life or disembodied immortality, or as  a catalyst or trigger for an experience of the afterlife, or as embodying the threat  of punishment in hell or the promise of reward in heaven. But it doesn’t follow  from any of these points that eternal recurrence dissolves death in the eternal  cycle or converts death into a moment just like any other moment in a human  life. As G S 341 makes clear, an eternally recurring life still retains a succession  and sequence (R eihe und Folge ), and death still is the very final moment in this  sequence before the entire identical sequence repeats itself. To say that this  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   111 4/21/11   11:47:04 AM </page> <page sequence="19"> 112  PAUL S. LOEB very final moment is just like any other moment is like saying that the  ending  of any musical composition, which can be replayed identically, is just like any  other moment in the composition. But Nietzsche’s analogy to a music box that  eternally repeats its tune (G S 109) and his emphasis on musical directions,  “ Noch Eimal !” (Z  :III “Vision and Riddle” 1;  Z :IV “Sleepwalker’s Song” 1, 12)  and d a capo (B GE 56), show that he strongly privileges this particular moment  as signifying the finale of the entire sequence. Thus, even in an eternally recur- ring life, the moment of death is still a kind of threshold, although now into the  recommencement of the same entire sequence and into an e mbodied immortal- ity. In my study, I argue at length that this is the meaning of Nietzsche’s central  riddle of the  Thorweg Augenblick (Loeb 2010, 46–69). In addition, the moment  of death is still a unique catalyst or trigger for the experience of an i dentical  afterlife. In my study, I show how Nietzsche emphasizes the revelatory qual- ity of this experience, as well as the crushing threat this experience can hold  for those who are life-impoverished (like Socrates) and the joyful reward this  experience can hold for those who are overflowing with life (like Zarathustra).  Indeed, given my account of the role memory plays with respect to the moment  of death within an eternally recurring life, I would say that Nietzsche discovered  a new and literal concept of m emento mori that serves to complement his earlier  concept of m emento vivere .   I will mention one last problem with Del Caro’s claim that eternal recurrence  is supposed to vanquish death. Like Rosen, Stern, and most other commentators,  Del Caro (2004, 230–54) interprets eternal recurrence as Nietzsche’s ideal of life  affirmation and is disinclined to take seriously the metaphysical or cosmologi- cal dimensions of this thought. Also like most other commentators, Del Caro  (1989, 232; 2004, 250) thinks that Nietzsche is merely using eternal recurrence  as a rhetorical device to encourage authentic living. By contrast, I argue that  Nietzsche came to believe in the truth of cosmological eternal recurrence. Thus,  the reason he recommends the affirmation of life’s eternal recurrence is that he  believes life really does eternally recur (and necessarily so): to reject the eternal  recurrence of life is therefore to reject life itself. But this means that Del Caro and  others who think that Nietzsche did not believe this—who claim that Nietzsche  believed death is final (Del Caro 1989, 228–32)—are actually attributing to him  a formula or test of life d enial , that is, of wanting life to be other than it is.   Since Del Caro thinks that Nietzsche actually believed that death is final and  merely employed eternal recurrence as a rhetorical device to shift the focus  away from the hereafter, the question arises as to why Nietzsche didn’t simply  deny the existence of an afterlife. Why did he go so much further and teach that  life eternally recurs? One critical answer, proposed by many and debated by  Del Caro (1989, 228–29) himself, is this: although Nietzsche knew that death  is final, he simply couldn’t accept this fact, and so he posited life’s repetition so  as to vanquish death’s finality and erase the horror of nonbeing.  JNS 41_09_Loeb.indd   112 4/21/11   11:47:04 AM </page> <page sequence="20">  ZARATHUSTRA HERMENEUTICS  113  On my reading, by contrast, Nietzsche certainly did believe that life eternally  recurs. But this means that he was not in any way using this doctrine as a rhe- torical device—not in order to encourage life affirmation, not in order to shift  the focus away from the hereafter, and not in order to vanquish death. Instead,  he argued, eternal recurrence is true, therefore there is no afterlife. But also, he  argued: eternal recurrence is true, therefore death is not final. Thus, contrary to  Del Caro and most scholars, Nietzsche did not see the claims of afterlife and  final death as opposed to each other. The afterlife is not false because final death  is true; rather,  both are false because eternal recurrence is true. According to  Nietzsche, it is no coincidence that Socrates in the A pology is equally happy to  think of death as the entry into Hades or as the start of an eternal dreamless sleep.  Those who are life-impoverished, like Socrates, see both the afterlife and final  death as welcome alternatives to an eternally recurring life. Or rather, as I argue  in my study, Nietzsche claimed the following: although the life-impoverished  remember that life eternally recurs, they simply cannot accept this fact, and so  they posit b oth the afterlife a nd final death so as to vanquish life’s eternal recur- rence and erase the horror of having to relive their lives for all eternity. Against  these falsifiers and life-deniers, Nietzsche envisioned a future philosopher who is  so overflowing with life that he is able to accept, affirm, embrace, love, and wed  life just as she is: “Oh how should I not lust after eternity and after the wedding  ring of rings—the ring of recurrence!” (Z : III “Seven Seals”).
