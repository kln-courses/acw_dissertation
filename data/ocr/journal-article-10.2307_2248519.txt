<plain_text><page sequence="1">II.-PROFESSOR LAURIE'S NATURAL REALISM.' BY PROFESSOR J. B. BAIILLIE. II. THE ONTOLOGY OF NATURAL REALISM. THE meditations in the second volume of the Synthetica. areJ exclusively devoted to the consideration of two problems- the nature and meaning of Ultimate Reality, and the place in that Reality of man's individual existence. While these- problems are necessarily connected in every way, they are treated as distinct. And rightly so; for it is difficult to say- which, in a speculative interpretation of experience, is to be taken as logically prior. From one point of view doubtless; the solution of the first problem is determined by the signi-- ficance assigned to man's individuality in the whole: from another point of view it is equally evident that the meaninag of Ultimate Reality determines the solution of 'the second problem. In Prof. Laurie's arguments the problems are so interrelated that it is only by a process of abstraction that they can be discussed separately. The meditations are described as ontological in character.. But this does not mean that the epistemology contained in- the first volume is merely to be treated as a ladder to be, thrown down when we have reached the height of specula-- tive vision. The epistemology remains with us throughout the ontology, both in the sense that the ontological synthesis. is a kind of knowledge, anrd in the sense that the conclusions of the epistemology now reappear as elements in the compo- sition of the specific meaning of the Absolute as -such. The results of the epistemology are, in fact, recast in the interests of an " absolute synthesis ". We are here dealing with a different object of knowledge, and an object of a very peculiar kind. At the outset, there- fore, two preliminary questions regarding Prof. Laurie's method must be considered. What form of knowledge is to 1 Since the following article went to press the distinguished author of the Synthetica has passed away. It was the hope of the writer that some reply might have been made by Prof. Laurie to certain criticisms the article contains. But there seems no reason for making any change in the form or substance of these criticisms, now that a reply is unhappily no longer possible.</page><page sequence="2">PROFESSOR LAURIE S NATURAL REALISM. 185 be adopted for the attainment of this " absolute synthesis"? And to what extent does the subject-object relation charac- teristic of knowledge still hold in the case of an " absolute synthesis " which ostensibly transcends finitude ? On the first question, Prof. Laurie's statements seem at first somewhat ambiguous. Prof. Laurie leaves us at the end of vol. i. still within the region of finite human knowledge, with the conception of rational synthesis analysed, and the potencies and limits of systematic reflection delineated. Such reflection is confined to the interpretation of phenomenal reality, and merely brings out in connected form the sub- stantial content of the individual. He has not yet discussed the stage of " rational intuition," the highest level of know- ledge. But he goes so far as to say in vol. ii.1 that this highest level or kind of knowledge is not found in our finite experience, though it is a "probable level of being "*2 This position is difficult to maintain, for otherwise where is the source of our knowledge. of what is transfinite to be found? 'Rational intuition' is the only remaining type of cognitive activity to which the knowledge we want could be assigned. And this is really admitted to be the source of the higher synthesis. For our author declares3 that the " activity of mind" by which we " behold " "Being Uncon- ditioned" as the "One of all Actuality" is "to be called Intuition": here "we see all in God ". With this state- ment too may be compared the expressions used in the opening paragraphs of the volume,4 wh6re Prof. Laurie points out that insight, vision, is the end of all cognition, and the function by which we apprehend Ultimate Reality. There does, in fact, seem no other way than that of " rational intuition " by which the absolute synthesis or ontology could be furnished; and the apparent inconsistency in maintaining that "rational intuition " is not ours, and yet is the condi- tion of an absolute synthesis, can only be verbal in character if our author's position is to be intelligible. The organ or function of rational intuition, which is the highest reach of knowledge, being thus the means of supply- ing us with our ontological synthesis, it is evident that the method of this synthesis cannot consist of a series of demon- strations. Demonstration in the sense of proof is out of the question: 5 all we can do is to "indicate," " contemplate," " unveil " or " reveal " the content and nature of the Abso- lute. This is not merely necessary, it is sufficient for 'the I Syn., ii., pp. 54-55. 2libid., p. 56. 3lbid., p. 193, cf. precisely similar expressions on pp. 195-196. 4Ibid., pp. 1-2. 5Ibid., p. 2. 13</page><page sequence="3">186 PROFESSOR J. B. BAILLIE: purposes of knowledge, on Prof. Laurie's theory of know ledge. It is necessary, because in dealing with the Whole, the " One-All " as such, we cannot proceed by employing a function of knowledge which deals ostensibly with parts of experience qua parts, which analyses and "comprehends" these under the assunmption of, but not by explicit reference to, the Absolute: we can only make use of a function which, while implying, yet transcends such a stage of know- ledge, and which, being the end of all knowledge, deals with complete unity as unity, views the whole as a whole and in a single act of knowledge. And it is sufficient, because this final function of knowledge gathers up all the varied mean- ing of reality apprehended by the subordinate levels of know- ledge, brings all these varied meanings to a single focus, shows them to be phases of a single unity, in short reads them in the light of, and recasts their contents in terms of, the one unity which they all severally imply and together exhaustively express, so far at least as man's plane of being is concerned. Beyond what the various levels of knowledge convey the Whole has no meaning for man; to gather up and focus all this meaning is therefore to reveal the Whole as a whole. In a sense, then, this supreme intuition does not give us anything new,' unless the vision of the unity as such be something new. To see the unity as a unity is thus suffi- cient for the apprehension of the Absolute and for the pur- poses of knowledge. It is important to observe at once that the intuition is not ,a mere subjective process of finite mind without an objective counterpart. It seems indeed to involve an annihilation of that distinction of subject and object on which knowledge rests, and which is the foundation of our author's epistem- ology. ,But in point of fact it is the culmination of know- ledge, and for that reason alone cannot contradict the essen- tial nature of knowledge. If the lower levels of knowledge have objectivity and 'reality,' most certainly the highest must have: and since knowledge is an expression of reality in the lower stages, it must be so all along the line. In fact it would be paradoxical to say that subject and object imply each other at the lower levels of knowledge, but that when we get to the highest the objective aspect suddenly slips from our grasp; and still more paradoxical to say that intui- tion has no objective content when the Absolute it professes to reveal is the very ground of the objectivity in all the pre- intuitional levels of knowledge. Intuition is merely the ISyn., ii., pp. 196-198.</page><page sequence="4">PROFESSOR LAURIE S NATURAL REALISM. 187 highest point of fusion of subject and object in human know- ledge. Moreover no matter how complete the fusion, the distinction of subject and object is still maintained; for, as our author points out, the vision, the intuition still implies an act of 'will' on the part of finite personality,' and thus preserves in a certain sense the essential distinction of sub- ject and object. But when so much is said regarding this function of intui- tion, we must not forget that there is an important distinc- tion between an intuition of the Absolute and an intuition by the Absolute. Rational intuition which makes possible ontology is the consummation of the knowledge of finite human mind, and remains within the limits' of the " man- plane " of being. This intuition of the Infinite Whole is a function of the finite being; it is a finite intuition. It can only produce an " absolute synthesis," not a " synthesis of the Absolute ". But while the intuition of the Infinite is not an Infinite Intuition, it is equallv important to bear in mind that a finite intuition is not a mere intuition of the finite. Man's mind does transcend in a real sense the bounds of finiteness, but only does so in a certain way: the restriction lies not in the fact of doing so but in the extent and degree to which he can do so. He only does so in such a way that what he says or sees of the Absolute is necessarily abstract, general and, as we may put it, perigraphic in character: it is never comprehensive and complete. What man says is, as we shall find, none the less absolutely true and universal: it is neither merely symbolic nor merely diagrammatic. The consideration of the second preliminary question above mentioned-the consistency of an " absolute synthesis " with the subject-object relation characteristic of knowledge-brings out a serious difficulty in the argument. On Prof. Laurie's view, subject and object are indissolubly united in man's experience, and, as we saw in the previous article, are both necessary for the attainment of knowledge. But the Abso- lute is described in the course of the ontology as the " uni- versal Object " which " includes man 2 it is the " absolute Actuality" which becomes "subjectively" what man finds it to be, it is the " synthesis of one and many," the many of which each man is a unit: it is the synthesis of " noume- non and phenomenon," 4 whereas man's individuality and experience have their being amidst the negations which con- stitute phenomenality. In other words, the ultimate -object of man's knowledge is at the same time the ground of all his Sy., ii., p. 196. 2Ibid., pp. 59-60. 3 Ibid., p. 62~ if. 4lbid., pp. 58, 69.</page><page sequence="5">188 PROFESSOR J. B. BAILLIE: experience, and contains man as a certain type or plane of being. It seems clear from this statement that the relation of subject and object as constituting man's experience, the relation of subject and object at man's plane of being, falls within the Absolute. How, then, can the Absolute be termed a ' universal object,' since object is always relative to subject and, in the present case, the subject is contained within this " universal object" ? And even if this be understood, to whom is that universal object now relative, when man's subject has, by hypothesis, fallen within the 'universal object'. Is the Absolute at once universal subject and universal object? On this last point Prof. Laurie seems in one passage 1 to hint that the Absolute is both Subject and Object: " the universal Subject is Absolute Being as imma- nent purposely determining itself," while " objectivity " (as a whole) is " subjectivity externalised ". But this still leaves the first point unsolved; and even, in a manner, increases the difficulty; for we cannot see what the relation is to be between the ' universal object' as such and man's ' object' on his specific plane, nor what the relation is between the Abso- lute as Universal Subject and man as subject. If man's experience, subject with object, falls within the one Abso- lute Synthesis, it is difficult to understand why such a synthesis should be called an " object " at all. If, however, it is not an 'object' to man, then it is impossible that it can be apprehended in any sense that is relevant to man's ex- perience. While, finally, if the Absolute " in its lonely self- identity " is a universal object to itself as Universal Subject, then it seems illegitimate to treat man's experience, man's plane of being, as falling solely within the universal object; it must also in some sense have to do with the 'Universal Subject'. From the fact that Prof. Laurie has not discussed this difficulty,2 we may assume that it is not so insuperable as it at first sight appears, and that it does not seriously imperil the coherence of his argument. If we take the phrase ' uni- versal object' very literally, and insist on the object being kept rigidly distinct from the subject, in the way Prof. Laurie has maintained in the first volume, then no doubt the difficulty just mentioned may well seem insuperable. Nor can we urge in defence that there has been some loose- ness in the phraseology adopted. For it is certain that the Absolute must include the finite subject, and it is equally ISyn., ii., p. 75. 2The paragraph on p. 278 hardly meets this difficulty.</page><page sequence="6">PROFESSOR LAURIE S NATURAL REALISM. 189 certain that if the Absolute is to be known at all it must in some sense be an object, the " universal object ". We may perhaps escape from the difficulty in this way. The ultimate question really is whether the Absolute as such can be an object at all. If it can be an object for a finite subject, then the problem as to its being known is at once solved, on Prof. Laurie's theory; for given a subject-object relation ipso facto we have knowledge. Our author is of course far fromn committing the obvious fallacy of asserting that the Absolute is an object and so can be known. On the contrary, he insists that the Absolute in its totality cannot be known by man: a " synthesis of the Absolute" is beyond us.' The Absolute in a certain sense is thus not an object at all for us. At the same time "All is One," and our finite individuality exists within the " one-all ". The forms which the subject-object relation sustains within our experience are thus within this "one-all," and are the Absolute at our 4"plane of being". This was established in the epistem- ology. Hence the object world we find or form in the course of knowledge is the Absolute as finitised in the various mo- :ments or stages of knowledge; and at these various stages the Absolute is as completely known as our subject-activity is capable of knowing it. Thus the Absolute is our object only in the sense in which the various stages of knowledge, formed as a matter of fact in finite experience, possess an objective content. In other words, when we are realising the function of knowledge in any of its forms, we are ex- pressing the nature of objectivity, and to express objectivity truly is to reveal the Absolute. Only to that extent is the Absolute our object in so far as in finite experience the sub- ject-object relation is found as a matter of fact to hold. Beyond this we do not know, and in any other sense the Absolute is not our object at all. What we know in finite experience is indeed truly known, and is the concrete realisa- tion of the nature of the Absolute " at our plane "; and se far the Absolute is truly our object. But beyond that there is no knowledge and no object. To this, there is one quali- fication, which Prof. Laurie is at pains to emphasise. While we know nothing of what the real nature of the Absolute is outside the above limitations, we do know that our finite individuality is within the "all-one," and that this "all- one " is the whole, a " transcendent " whole immeasurably beyond us.2 But all that this knowledge amounts to is the bare fact that there is such a whole-a fact of vast import- ISyn., ii., pp. 32, 50ff. 2 Ibid., p. 50ff.</page><page sequence="7">190 PROFESSOR J. B. BAILLIE: ance doubtless, and one which delivers us from the perils of mere pluralism, but not a fact whose fullness of content can possibly enter our reflective experience. It is a fact that enters knowledge in the form of feeling, and is only present at the emotional level of experience. We may perhaps point the contrast between the epistem- ology and the ontology of these "meditations" by saying that in the former our author reads the meaning of human experience from the point of view of the subject, and finds it consisting of certain kinds of truth about the Absolute; in the latter he reads the same experience from the point of view of the object and finds it consisting in certain kinds of content of the Absolute. What we have above stated regarding the all-important question of method has partly anticipated the development of the argument in the ontology. It is clear that such a way of approaching the problem of the nature of the Absolute very closely resembles the method of anthropomorphismrn it is equally clear that the method does claim to supply objective universal knowledge of the Absolute. In stating the content of the notion of God, Prof. Laurie frankly takes the finite as the " necessary 7rov o-rTc," I and therefore has in some way to furnish this objective knowledge in spite of the ap- parent limitations which anthropomorphism implies. It is thus not surprising that at an early stage in his argument he finds himself constrained to face this problem and to discuss the significance of anthropomorphism.2 As a matter of fact he keeps this problem in view throughout his whole argu- ment in the ontology. And he must do so; for undoubtedly his interpretation of the nature of God and of the relation of finite individuation to the Absolute is controlled from first to last, as we shall see, by what constitutes and determines the nature of man's life. From anthropomorphism he admits there is no escape.3 The only question is, does this prevent us from attaining positive and objective knowledge of God ? The term anthro- pomorphism almost invariably implies a limitation, not merely in the extent of man's knowledge of the Absolute, but in the quality of that knowledge. This restriction is very often taken to mean that any kind of statement about the Absolute, because derived from man's human apprehen- sion, must be the expression of his peculiar needs and nature, and therefore is bound to ascribe to the Whole a character and content admittedly peculiar to a part of that Whole, viz., 1 Syn., ii., p. 55. 2 lbid., Med. 2. 3Tbid., p. 27.</page><page sequence="8">PROFESSOR LAURIE' S NATURAL REALISM. 191 man. If we are to admit any statement as necessary or legi- timate for certain purposes, it is asserted that we can do so only on the understanding that the result be regarded as symbolic at the best, and for the most part as illusory. Prof. Laurie does not directly meet this conception of anthropomorphism, which would certainly be fatal to any objective knowledge of God. He circumvents it by a line of argument as ingenious as it is penetrating. The above conception of anthropomorphism rests on the position that the knowledge of God is a separate process of knowledge which takes place when man, it may be at the end of his knowledge of the finite facts of experience, asks himself the question what God means. Before this question could arise, it seems assumed, he must have known other things, things which he may know with complete certainty, but among which there is no such object as that of God. To face the question what is God is thus to face a new, unique, and distinctive object of knowledge. But since the only kinds of knowledge he is used to, are those which deal with perception and inference, he will proceed in dealing with this new object too, by way of perception or inference, or both. Hence, on the one hand, the so-called "proofs" for the existence of God are brought forward as the only way of answering the question put, and, on the other, it is pointed out that, since even the very idea of proof starts from our finite human experience and its needs, the attempt to apply to this unique transcendent object the terms, methods and results which any such process of proof involves, settles ab initio the essentially inadequate character of any conclusion we may draw or statement we may make. Prof. Laurie corrects the cardinal assumption on which this whole view rests. The Absolute, as he maintained in his epistemology, is the ultimate object of our knowledge all along the line of experience, whatever the kind of knowledge may be and whatever stage of knowledge we take. - And here, in vol. ii., he repeats that the " need and quest for God " is the goal of all man's striving towards the attainment of his end in the plane of being which he occupies. Man's very consciousness of his' singleness" of being carries with it a sense of "'dependence "1 on an unconditioned ground, a Uni- versal-Being; for onily so could the 'isolation' and 'solitude' -of his being be supported and maintained. This sense of 'dependence,' or of 'oneness,' is in its simplest form only found in feeling, but it none the less carries reality with it; 1 Syn., ii., p. 8.</page><page sequence="9">192 PROFESSOR J. B. BAILLIE: it is a feeling of oneness with all being, and this remains with man from one end of his conscious experience to the other. The "objectivity" characteristic of knowledge at any stage, the " necessity," or again the " universality " of knowledge is in every case constituted by the same ultimate Reality; for the activity of reason involved in establishing such knowledge is the realisation in man of the nature of the Absolute. Hence we are not facing a new and separate object when we seek to know the Absolute as such; we are merely reconstituting and reaffirming at the highest stage of knowledge, an object that has been with us, and is with us, at each of the distinct levels of knowledge which our ex- perience contains. And, therefore, in the second place, our knowledge of God specifically is only anthropomorphic in the sense in which all our knowledge of anything whatever is anthropomorphic. In other words, our knowledge of God is not anthropomorphic in any sense which precludes it from being objective and universal. Partial and general, a more ' outline' our knowledge of the Absolute may be and is; but a partial thought is not an erroneous thought.' Moreover, the mental necessity to look at our experience as a whole is just as well founded as that which compels us to know any part of it. We may say, in fact, that the 'uni- versals' of thought in knowing are the points of arrestment in the process of satisfying that mental necessity which lies behind the process. This necessity comes from our being aware of our existence as individual parts of a Whole. That our knowledge of God should be progressive thus lies in the nature of the case 2 it means no mnore than that our know- ledge is an activity of a type of being that grows towards its end. But our knowledge is none the less valid at each stage of the progress; and the progress is not radical change, but alteration of a conception that remains in its essence the same in the least and in the most advanced type of mind.3 Further, we cannot rest satisfied in the mere fact that our knowledge has or may have objectivity and necessity. We must interpret for ourselves this objectivity characteristic of knowledge, so as at once to show its source in what is beyond ourselves, and at the. same time account for its compelling force in ourselves. The problem, in short, is not so much whether by our knowledge we know God, as to give an intel- ligible account of the fundamental character of our own knowledge.4 In our knowledge we are carried beyond our- ISyn., ii., p. 30. 2Ibid., pp. 7-23, 30. 3Ibid., pp. 20-21. 4As our author says, p. 70, the 'knowledge of knowing is knowing God '-precisely the position adopted by the post-Kantian idealists.</page><page sequence="10">PROFESSOR LAURIE'S NATURAL REALISM. 193 selves: What is this " beyond ourselves," and how can we express it? Prof. Laurie answers the question by simply synthesising the objective aspects involved in our experience, unifying them into one single totality, which thereby consti- tutes and determines the knowledge we actually have. So interpreted the Whole as such merely expresses itself in man's activity on his plane of being; the Whole or Absolute " sub- jectivises 1 itself in man's mind, and thus gives his know- ledge that objectivity and necessity which it possesses as a fact. At first sight it would seem as if the objectivity of man's experience were here simply taken per se, were treated as a separate fact, and then straightway identified with God or the Absolute, the source from which man's experience arises and to which that experience returns. But such an obviously mechanical and external relation between man's experience and God Prof. Laurie is far from adopting. The relation between man's knowledge and God is as intimate as the rela- tive holding between subject and object within any region of the finite. As subject and object in the latter case are con- tinuous and inseparable, so man and God are continuous and inseparable. This is the essential principle of the argument. But it introduces a certain ambiguity. The ambiguity ap- pears in the statements Prof. Laurie himself makes. At one time the Absolute is spoken of as the " unity of man's ex- perience-the sum of the Actual on the grade and within the orb of finite Inan-mind" 2 God is the "reflection of the distinctive man-being himself": 3 God is the " sum of ideals ". At other times again the Absolute as a totality is held to be "transcendent,"I "infinite" and "immeasur- able," and as "immanent and unconditioned ground 6 the system of " individua "1 7of which man is one. The ambiguity here is more one of expression than of principle. God is not taken to be either the mere hyposta- tisation of the objective content of man's experience viewed as a whole, nor simply the reality left over after man's specific experience is exhausted and complete. Prof. Laurie's point is that the unity or totality of mnan's experience is God for man; but that this very experience is at the same time con- sciously conditioned, related to what transcends its indivi- duality, and so implicates the unconditioned whole of Being. All planes of being are continuous with one another, and the one Absolute is imnmanent in each and all. The continuity ISsyn., ii., p. 45. 2Ibid., p. 49. 1Ibid., p. 27. 4Ibid., p. 110. 5Ibid., p. 50 ff. 6lbid., pp. 86-87. 71Ibid.,9 p. 64.</page><page sequence="11">194 PROFESSOR J. B. BAILLIE: is no doubt the most general feature of the Absolute, and as such has no more content than that of bare Being, or " being unconditioned" as our author calls it. But this continuity is a component constituent of each plane, along with all the other content that makes up the concrete fullness and specific character of each stage. Hence, while to each plane God is primarily the complete realisation of that plane, yet God is not, even to that plane itself, confined within'the four walls, so to say, of its individuality, but is also that continuity of being which unites all planes of individuality. Thus, in man's case, God is the unity of man's experience in the first in- stance, or man " receives the totality of God at his plane" 1 but within man's conscious experience there lies this con- tinuity with all being as a fact, a fact of 'feeling,' a 'felt continuity'. Hence God is for man this continuity of man's being with 'all being as well as the concrete fullness which constitutes man's specific plane: God therefore means to man both the totality of man's own experience and the continuity of man with all being whatsoever.2 These two essential m6ments in the meaning of' God are distinguished as the immanence and the transcendence of God. The immanence of God in man's life is simply God as realised in the total range of man's specific plane of being, or, as we may say, God humanised: it means 'continuously repeated pulsation' throughout all the manifold activity of his life. The transcendence as such is for man God's concrete reality as realised in planes and forms of being other than man's. Since God is the "Absolute Whole," the Absolute is the immanent substance of all planes and kinds of being, of all individua. The distinction between immanence and transcendence is one which has -validity only from the point of view of the individual planes of being. From that point of view they are aspects of Absolute Reality. But to the Absolute per se, so to say, the only essential function is that of immanence. Transcendence is entirely relative to a given plane of being, and only holds as between one plane of being and other planes. In other words, the Absolute is not trans- cendent to Itself; but solely imnmanent. The Absolute is transcendent only for a specific individual type of being; for that concrete content of the Absolute, in virtue of which and 1 Syn., ii., p. 59.. 2 The history of man's religious life confirms this analysis, for now ther former is emphasised and now the latter: when the former is emphasisedc to the exclusion of the latter we get forms of religion that are crudely anthropomorphic: when the latter is exaggerated we get the most abstract attitudes of religious mysticism.

To man's apprehension, then, God is both immanent and transcendent. We apprehend God as both, but the appre- hension in the one sense is different, almost in kind, from that in the other. It is only in regard to the former that we can be said to know God at all; it is indeed only as immanent that we want to know God.' And God can be known in this sense; 2 in fact, since God immanently constitutes the very universals of man's knowledge, we may be said to know nothing else but God as immanent. God " speaks through man"; the God of man is God-man 3 and the knowing of man's own knowledge is the knowing of God.4 But as transcendent we can hardly be said to 'know' God at all - we merely apprehend 'that' God is but not 'what' God is qua transcendent.5 We only know God as finitised in our own human experience. All the rest is immeasurably beyond our grasp. To know that God is transcendent is no doubt much, and we apprehend this much in 'feeling': but it is entirely unequal to the fullness of God's Reality qua trans- cendent. If we could know God both as immanent in our experience and as transcendent we should contradict our own nature. 6 Thus the above ambiguity referred to is removed by this theory: we are delivered both from the sinister limitations, of anthropomorphism and yet confined, for all the satisfac- tory knowledge of God we have, to the 'totality of man's experience'. By the line of thought above indicated we are directly led to the interpretation of the positive content of the notion of God. It is impossible fully to convey in a few sentences the range of ideas covered by the profound analysis of this conception given in Meditations vi.-xi. But the main elements can be stated in such a way as to be intel- ligible in spite of brevity. " If I am exiled from God, how can I hold converse with Him? If I am in identity with God, how could the question of God ever arise?" 7 In this sentence, typical of so many in Prof. Laurie's analysis, there is indicated the ultimate' factors involved in the notion of God. God is One, and the samne One, in all phases and forms of reality; but finite individuation, distinct, nay, separate from this one, is equally an essential moment in the Absolute. As one, God is Being- I 11n, ., p. 94. 2Ibid., pp. 59-62. -3lbid., pp. 30-33. Ibid., p. 70. 2 Ibid., pp. 85. 6 Ibid., p. 52. Ibid., p. 68.</page><page sequence="13">196 PROFESSOR J. B. BAILLIE: unconditioned, the ultimate continuum, the all-pervading 'substrate of the conditioned many, which our finite experi- fence reveals to us as inexplicably 'given'. This Uncondi- tioned Being is directly apprehended in feeling at the basis of *our experience, and is directly reaffirmed in intuition as the final achievement of human knowledge. It is the first and the last moment in the conception of God. But the dialectic activity of reflective intelligence, of "will-reason," affirms the positive existence of the independent individua, the dis- tinctions and connexions amongst which it seeks to estab- lish. Without such individua its movement could neither begin nor end. Their distinctiveness is implied in its very process, and that process is the necessary development of the 'life of mind. The independence of finite individua, and the positive subsistence of the conditioned, are thus as ultimate as the unconditioned unity and continuity of the Absolute revealed in feeling. The 'separateness,' 'limitation,' 'con- ,ditionedness' of individua is due to the factor in the Abso- aute which our author calls 'negation'. An individuum is the union of affirmation and negation, and these are' indis- !soluble moments in its composition. The individuum insists on the one, just as much as the other: it miust 'affirm' to be an entity at all: it must 'negate' so as not to be any- thing else but itself. It is the Absolute in it that affirms its being; it is the Absolute that equally comnpels it to negate, by giving it a specific character and conatent to affirm. The tsum of individua gives us the " many " of the universe. The totality of the individua is the 'phenomenalisation,' the 'ex- ternalising' of God. But however essential individuals are to the life of the Absolute, they are not as such, nor is the sum of them,1 the Absolute. They are the Absolute in 'the form of 'difference,' in virtue of its function of negation. Finite individua are God's 'opposite,' God's 'other,' 2 ' they are and they are not' God, or, as our author characteristically puts it, they are 'God and God-not . The first and last word about the Absolute is unconditioned Being, continuous and one. Of this all individuation is an expression. The Absolute as such is solely affirmation; the Absolute is present in negation as 'Being': but negation is a qualification of individua only. Hence God is not an individual.4 Again, because the Absolute as pure affirmation is the posi- tive substance of individua, the plurality of individuals is not the mere emanation of the Absolute; the Absolute is 'imma- nent' 5 in individua, It is their being.

In this aspect individuals in affirming their own nature are affirm-- ing God's being: they are 'on the side of' God, are, e.g., in man's case, ' co-workers' with God. They do not therefore exist so much for God simply; they exist for themselves: or rather in existing for themselves they exist in God. This is, what Prof. Laurie means by his 'monistic pluralism,' X which he holds to be distinct from pantheism or from mere pluralism. On the other hand, in virtue of the factor of 'negation,' which' is inalienable from the nature of an individual, the individual,. so to say, subsists in his own right, even it may be as against the Absolute. To insist on the element of negation is just as necessary as to insist on the positive content. In the exercise of the function of negation the finite individual is quite capable of, and in a certain sense cannot help, 'resist- ing ' 2 God. This expression is no metaphor in Prof. Laurie's. theory. It is taken quite strictly and literally, and is regarded as the logically necessary consequence of negation being con- stitutive of the nature of the individual. We shall see the part it plays in the discussion on immortality. Meantime it is important to notice that negation is an element of oppo- sition (not necessarily contradiction) 3 inherent in all finitude- Only by negation, in fact, is finitude to be 'saved' 4 saved, that is, from ultimate or approximate annihilation in an Abso- lute which is a mere neutrum. To 'save finitude' therefore is essential even in the interests of the Absolute; for only so, is It a concrete Absolute, instead of a mere abstraction. Negation brings with it what Prof., Laurie calls 'cosmic sin'; it brings 'casualty,' 'contingency,' 'disorder' into the world.5 But these are 'facts' which have to be reckoned with, even though they may not be attributed to the Abso- late.6 With all the difficulties involved in the fact of negation, it is better to admit that finite individuals can and do 'resist' God and 'God's purposes,' than accept the con-- ception of a 'fated world '.' When we ask what further God means for man in particular,. as distinct fromn what God is in individuals in general, the answer is easy to find. God is immanent in man's individu-- ality, for man is one amongst many individuals; and God is- there the positive substance and source of man's nature, in the sphere of feeling as well as the moving principle of the dialectic- of 'vwill-reason'. God is immanent in all the life of feeling, ' the basis and terminus of mind'; 8 in the higher forms of I Syn. , ii. p. 76. 2 Ibid., P. 75. 3 Ibid., pp. 133-134. 4Ibid., pp. 75, 99. 5Ibid., pp. 82, 128. 6 Cf.

BAILLIE: rationalised feeling' which we have in the sphere of artistic beauty, in the system of rational comprehension, evolved from the basis of sense life, in that harmony of man's emotional life which is the consummation of his moral activity. God, in short, is the End in the form of Beauty, Truth and the Good; God is 'perfection,' the 'sum' of human 'ideals'.' Feeling is the basis of experience in the case of 'art,' 'knowledge' and 'morality'; and God is present in feeling: the end is the ground of all these processes; and God is that end. God 'affirms' these ideais as iman's true being, as constitutive of man's nature.2 God is thus 'mnind' in all its grades, and is not mere 'reason' or 'thought'. God in- deed is more present as feeling than as thought, which is the 'servant of feeling,' the servant by 'being master' of feel- ing.3 And, again, God is self-conscious, is ego or spirit; but in an 'infinite sense '. God must be at least as concrete as any of the finite individua, and, being immanent in man who is self-conscious, spirit, God must be in that sense self- conscious spirit. But God is not any individual, even the highest we know, viz., man. Hence the qualification in an 'infinite sense'. For a similar reason God is 'personality,' but not a personality.5 These, then, are the primary moments in the conception of God. They are necessary and sufficient to justify the reli- gious life, which is the 'personal emotional attitude to the highest,' 6 the sole basis of which is the 'feeling of God' (not the recognition of the fact of God) ,7 and the consumma- tion of which in a 'thinking man's religion' is 'his phil- osophy vitalised by feeling, and inspired with emotion'*8 Before passing to consider Prof. Laurie's meditations on the problem of evil and the problem of immortality, we may pause to make a comment which will partly anticipate any further criticism of his views regarding these problems. It is extremely difficult, in the light of Prof. Laurie's own state- ments, to accept without qualificastion his conception of an Absolute 'resisted' by finite individuality. One cannot but have every sympathy with his attempt to maintain the claims of finitude in the system of things. And as a matter of principle it is undoubtedly sound to treat the problem of human individuality as a particular case of the general question regarding the nature of finitude; for what holds of finitude in general will be true of the human individual.

He states expressly that we cannot understand negation any more than we can understand being: 1 that our knowledge even of individua is surrounded by ignorance: 2 and he insists that we have no 'synthesis of the Absolute,' but at the best only an 'Absolute synthesis'. He holds, too, that affirmation, which the Absolute essentially is, 'overpowers' negation in such a way as to make an orderly whole of all the strivings and oppositions of finitude, and to realise in the long run the end or 'idea' immanent in each finite in- dividual: 3 that differences are not absolute differences: 4 and that 'negation negates itself'.' Add to this that he -repeatedly asserts that God is in large measure incompre- hensible, and that even our reason at its best has to be sup- plemented by a 'faith' which anticipates the goal of reason and is its consummation 6-and surely, in the light of these various expressions, we are not entitled to admit the position that 'resistance' of the Absolute is either an essential attri- bute of finitude or a consistent interpretation of the nature of the Absolute. ' Resistance' as a necessary and essential attribute implies an opposition that never is and never ca&amp; be overcome: wbereas Prof. Laurie's positive assertions re- garding the Absolute, combined with his admission of the vast field of ignorance regarding the Absolute which sur- 'rounds any knowledge we have, precludes us from main- taining such a doctrine. It seems certainly paradoxical to 'save finitude' at a price which destroys all hope of that reconciliation with the Whole wherein lies the peace that comes of understanding. The danger of this over-insistence on the element of nega- tion appears very forcibly in our author's treatment of the question of evil and the problem of immortality. These two may be conveniently taken together. For, in a manner, we may look upon the meditations on these topics as respectively the development of the implication of the negative and affirm- ative aspects of human individuality. Evil in all its fornis is the result of the negative element specifically; immortality is ultimately due to the affirmative element in human indi- viduality. In Prof. Laurie's treatment, however, the aspects are discussed as if they were separable; but the result of his discussion is to show that the latter is necessary to ISyn., ii., p. 100. 2Ibid., p. 79ff. 3lIbid., pp. 78, 115. 4Ibid., p. 81. 5Ibid., p. 83. 6'bid., p. 137.</page><page sequence="17">200 PROFESSOR J. B. BAILLIE-: supplement the consequences of the former, that immortality is demanded by the very existence of evil in experience. No doubt the two aspects are distinct; but on his own showing they are not separate; and to separate themn for discussion creates quite unnecessary difficulties in his treatment of these topics. He introduces the problem of evil by again emphasising the fact of negation as constitution of the sphere of finite individuality. Negation is the principium individuattionis; 1 all determination is a synthesis of affirmation and negation: individua are the union of opposite factors, foci of contradic- tory elements. This is true, not merely of individuals in the Whole, but atso of the constitution of each individuum, whether 'thing' or 'man'. The colmponent elements of each are opposed to the unifying 'idea,' which is the com- plete meaning or end of each; they resist the attainment of this 'idea'; they are, relatively to the idea, the negation of it.2 This resistance, opposition, negation, operating in each individual and among individuals inter se, if allowed to have its way, leads to chaos and confusion. And, but for the priority of affirmation, the controlling agency of the end or idea in each individual, and ultimately of the Absolute as the affirmative idea in each and all, chaos would be the result of this necessary resistance. In any case the opposition is irre- movable, even though the idea or end is triumphant, and is the source of casualty and contingency in the finite 'created' world. Strife is of the essence of individual existence, a striving to attain the ideal end through incessant opposition. In this activity the Absolute is involved; the affirmative element, and the ultimate triumph of the idea, mean the immanence of the Absolute in the individual, whether inor- ganic, organic or man. The striving of the creature is at the same time the striving of God.3 God, so to say, has realised so much of absolute reality in each finite centre, e.g., man, and that finite individual affirms or reaffirms this much on his own account and for itself. The individual strives'against the Absolute, but the Absolute also strives in the individual. The negation is in the Absolute; and hence the seriousness of the struggle and its issue. It follows from this intimate association of the Absolute with the struggle of the finite that the judgment on the re- sult cannot be one thing for the individual and another for the Absolute. The process must be judged as we find it, at the "man-plane of being," to use our author's expression. I Syn., ii., p. 264. 2Ibid., p. 265. 3 bid., p. 267.</page><page sequence="18">PROFESSOR LAURIE S NATURAL REALISM. 201 Now it is transparent that the process of finitude reveals contradictions unreconciled, more or less constant disorder, contingency and even anarchy. Hence Prof. Laurie con- cludes that the Absolute does not succeed in realising a har- mony of reality, at least so far as the actual plane of being, which man knows, is concerned.' There is an irrevocable element of the 'non-rational' in things as we know them: God is in process of attaining His end or idea, but so far He has not yet attained it. Not that the contingent irrational element is to be strictly attributed to God: it is the indivi- dual's doing: it merely opposes God, but does so by the very conditions of God's creative method. The Absolute is thus the source of the contingent of evil, though not the author of it.2 What applies to individual existence in general applies with full force to man's individuality in particular, where, indeed, we see opposition, negation, taking a peculiarly unique and intense form-individual freedom. This freedom, says our author, is the ' standing protest' against abstract mon- ism,3 the typical and highest mode of asserting the rights of individuality. Man has to realise his own idea and end for himself, as his own conscious task, a task assigned to, but not performed for, man by the Absolute. Man, like all other individua, contains necessarily contradiction, and this is not and never can be removed.4 Indeed the higher his indivi- duality the intenser and deeper is the contradiction in his constitution. Man is 'God's greatest, strangest, divinest and most deplorable work'.5 It is not difficult to see where, in this theory, evil is to appear, and what its nature is to be. Evil finds its possi- bility in the fact of negation. But negation per se is not necessarily evil or the source of evil: if negation could be overcome at every plane of being, more particularly at the plane of man, or could be removed in the long run and give place to affirmation, it could not be properly designated 'evil'. Evil only appears where negation remains as a con- stant irremovable factor in the process of individuality; for then it is not an accident, nor an incident in the constitution of the individual, but its necessary destiny. Now we have seen that negation is never removed at our plane of being, that God's purpose is not realised but perpetually being op- posed. The permanence of the negation is thus the essence of evil, for then negation militates against the fulfilment of the individual end, resists its true nature, and to that ex- l Syn., ii., p. 266. 2 Ibid., p. 271. 3fbid., p. 278.

The permanence of evil is to be ascribed in the long run to the Absolute, and indicates a failure to achieve its end. Hence our author's definition of evil as " the failure of God-creative to realise the ideal of the individual and of the whole on the plane of being man occupies ".1 He adds as a further definition, that we have evil when 'the process of attaining the end in the case of sentient beings involves unnecessary pain'. But this latter seems a subordinate form of the fundamental principle. The assertion that the Absolute does 'fail,' is primarily made of man's plane of being as this appears in the living present. But since this plane is the only one we now occupy, and the only one we know truly, the assertion is held to be absolutely true of actual experience as we have it. For given that the Absolute is, as our author holds, a " God of Love," a God whose purpose is the good of all individua, and given the facts of struggle, incompleteness and pain which we find on} every side, and there is only one term to describe the glaring contrast between these two and that term is 'failure' on all sides. The failure or evil is not so great in certain kinds of indi- vidual existence as in others. In inorganic existence in spite of conflict 'we have no reason to suppose that the creative end is not attained'.2 In the organic vegetable world, and the organic animal world, while failure is evident (e.g., a plant does not have always its proper conditions of subsistence,, and yet is allowed to be: an animal, again, suffers pain, often needless pain), yet on the whole we may say of both these realms that 'the good' or 'end' is dominant, perhaps, triumphant, through conflict and negation, largely in virtue of the inidividual being subordinate to the species whose end it furthers.3 Even in man's life "it is false to represent man's destiny here as wholly miserable," 'the good as meas- ured by fruition is dominant in the world '.4 But while this is admitted, and in spite of the fact that much of the suffering can be shown to be necessary, yet ' misery and pain are operative to an extent in excess of what, is needed to attain the purposed result': and, in man's case in particular, evil is found which is irremovable, inexplicable, and entirely unjustifiable. Man is ever inadequate to his own task of fulfilling himself. Nature is too strong for him. His very ideals are impossible of fulfilment, and must ever remain so: they elude him: his very demands make failure necessary and inevitable.5 In the case of man the Absolute I Syn., ii., p. 286. 2Ibid., p. 291. 3Ibid., pp. 293-294. 4lbid., pp. 301-305. 5 Ibid., p. 288 Sf.</page><page sequence="20">PROFESSOR LAURIE S NATURAL REALISM. 203 has failed and hopelessly failed, if we take life as we find it. In support of this contention our author in Med. xvi. and xvii. brings forward an eloquent indictment against the method by which man's world is controlled and directed, remarkable alike for its grasp of the concrete facts of life, its fearless incisive criticism, and its intense human feeling. His attitude is that of a captive stoic prince of intellect whose dignity is insulted by the scheme of ' government' in which he is forced to acquiesce, and who refuses to give up his claims to the best even when he has to surrender to the worst. He finds no alleviation against the evil in the con- solations of a speculative outlook; for this is but man's ' sad distinction of having assigned to him a share in vindicating for God as for himself the supremacy of spirit,' is but a 'fatal power of more fully comprehending the universal sor- row '. Taking our life in time as we find it, the system of things with its needless and superfluous suffering, struggle and pain, is evil, and cannot be justified. Without hesi- tation, therefore, since we cannot give up the 'irresistible instinct of Hope,' and must somehow 'remain loyal to the God whom we knew in part,' 2 he maintains that the only conclusion we can draw is that " the negation has been too strong for God"; 3 'God is a spirit but a spirit in difficulty,' 'from which he is slowly extricating himself '.4 Our task as men is to co-operate with Him, and 'sympathise with Him ' in His struggle as He sympathises with us in ours. 'If we are not only fellow-workers but fellow-sufferers with God, we then become reconciled to the universe.' 5 Such an indictment against the system of things makes man's position as well as God's apparently hopeless; and there would indeed seem something of mockery or something of irony in man's attempt to overcome the defects and imper- fections of his own situation by trying to remove those of God. But more remains to be said. Our author has so far taken the factor of negation and evil per se as a separate ele- ment in our temporal-spatial experience; and perhaps has thrown this so prominently into relief in order to prepare the way for a reassertion of the positive side of individuality which still remains to be considered. His indictment is only true if we confine our attention to the sphere of finite tem- poral existence. But that existence has a term put to it by the process of the world, and it may well be that this Syn., ii., pp. 308, 320. 2Ibid., pp. 275, 302. 3Ibid., pp. 330, 332. 4Ibid., pp. 336-337. 5 Ibid., p. 337.</page><page sequence="21">204 PROFESSOR J. B. BAILLIE: very term contains at once the condition of putting an end to these dire results of negation, and the suggestion of a further and final triumph of the affirmative factor in human individuality. 'God's honour is concerned' in seeing that 'our ethical perplexities and inevitable failures shall to and for us be ultimately resolved '.' The last stage in the process of negation may therefore hold the secret of the ultimate domination of the Good. This last stage, this final term to the negative process, is Death. This, if it is not the 'master- key of the problem' of negation and evil, is nothing but a 'grim sarcasm on man's ideals and aspirations,' 2 a 'pro- foundly immoral and glaringly irrational event'.3 Out of this worst form of evil our author draws the secret of the lasting good of the individual: in the most relentless type of negation we are to find the possibility of the completest affirmation: from the extremity of annihilation we Iderive the hope and opportunity of immortality. This may at first seem- the great paradox of Prof. Laurie's argument. And certainly one feels that if the affirmative significance of the human individual is so great as he insists in his defence of immortality, so great that its reality far outweighs the significance of the worst form of negation, then the previous indictment against the Absolute loses much, of its force. For surely if the positive aspect of human indi- viduality is so firmly established in the plan of the Absolute that it can survive the shock of earth's final catastrophe, one may fairly assume that human individuality can not after all be so gravely affected by the afflictions of its mundane career as to justify our author's tirade against the management of the world. And if God can carry man through the ordeal of the portentous negativity of the tomb, and plant him safely and for ever, with all his self-conscious completeness assured, in a realm of eternal life, it seems an extravagance of state- ment to speak of God being in a 'difficulty' and 'failing' in the accomplishment of His purpose. The truth seems to be that the strength of Prof. Laurie's accusations against the evil in the temporal system has somewhat over-reached itself, if his defence of immortality is to hold good. For if these accusations are true, then we seem hardly warranted at all in supposing that the individuality which is so bad here can ever be improved by a continuance of individual existence, that a God who 'fails' here can ever succeed anywhere else. While, on the other hand, if immortality, with all that this implies, can be established as at least highly probable in 1 Syn., ii., p. 321. 2 Ibid., p. 314. 3 bid., p. 315.</page><page sequence="22">PROFESSOR LAURIE S NATURAL REALISM. 205 spite of the present evil in things, then there can be no ground for making such accusations against the Absolute as destroy the very basis on which all hope of immortality might rest. Our life's imperfections may be held to demand immortality, but immortality is not to be had by threats. If it is childish to beg for immortality, it is certainly futile' to thunder imprecations against the denial of it. The statement of the arguments in favour of individual immortality in his last Meditation gives Prof. Laurie his op- portunity of showing his rare dialectical skill and fine specu- lative insight in dealing with ultimate problems. Whatever can be said in support of this conception is made the most of in this masterly treatment of a topic, the discussion of which seems as everlasting as the subject itself. It would be diffi- cult to find in the field of philosophical literature so complete a defence of immortality in the sense of individual immor- tality, and certainly difficult to find this statement surpassed. We need not rehearse the various 'proofs'. In principle they consist in a sustained, effort to justify by' specifically dis- tinct arguments dealing with detailed aspects of individuality the general position that the human individual has an affirm- ative or absolute factor in his constitution. The arguments therefore seem to amount to no more than an emphasis in detail on that positive substance which the individual derives from the Absolute, and which gives him, as our author previously showed, his affirmative content as an individual. All affirmation in individuality means the immanence of the Absolute in the individual. That is a fundamental position of Prof. Laurie's metaphysics. The arguments for immor- tality are in the last resort different ways of bringing out this immanence of the Absolute in the individual, in spite of the facts of change, negation and evil, which seem to imperil the security of man's substantial nature. The cogency of such arguments is always tainted by the logical defect which is inevitable when we try to proceed from the parts as such to the whole, or from the whole as such to the part. If we establish the essential importance of different positive factors in our whole nature we do not thereby prove the inherent importance of our whole nature itself; and conversely if we admit that a whole as such has value we do not thereby prove- that the same applies to the part. To apply this to the case of immortality. In the Abso- lute, value and existence are coincident: hence the futility of attempting to 'prove' the 'existence' of the Absolute, for this very proof must imply a contrast between value and existence which does not hold of the Absolute. In the case</page><page sequence="23">206 PROFESSOR J. B. BAILLIE: of man value and existence are heterogeneous and stand con- trasted; so much so that, e.g., in the moral life, existence is determined by and derived from value. Hence we have the attempt, legitimate in the case of man, to demonstrate, an essential and necessary connexion between our value and our existence; such a connexion is precisely what immortality means. The basis of the argument is either our value or our existence: in general the basis is our value, when we seek to 'prove' immortality. That value doubtless is permanent, is the 'affirmation' in us of the Absolute. But when, because the Absolute is the complete unity of value and existence, we try to argue that our value involves our existence too, we commit the fallacy of concluding that what is true of the Whole is true of the individual part: or again when we argue that, since our existence is determined by our value and our value is permanent, therefore the permanence of our value ensures the permanence of our existence, we are once more surreptitiously borrowing to assist our own case a truth holding only of the Whole, which by hypothesis we are not. Prof. Laurie is well aware of the inherent difficulty of finally proving individual immortality, and admits in so many words that 'coercive demonstration is impossible'. He goes even so far as to justify this inherent impossibility, by saying that 'it would have been a contradiction of the essential characteristic of the present system had immortality been put beyond all possible question'.' It seems a little paradoxical to make so strenuous an effort, as he has done, to demon- strate that man is immortal, and then to conclude the argu- ment by maintaining that the impossibility of a complete demonstration is itself an additional reason for the propo- sition to be demonstrated. But the fact is, the proof is impossible not because this is for our good, but because the premises and conclusion must in this case be logically inco- herent, for they are heterogeneous. It is ironical to make a merit of our inability to solve a logical fallacy. No doubt the impossibility of proof opens up the way to 'faith' on which he insists as an essential constituent of spiritual life.2 For what is regarded as 'a postulate of self-conscious ethical activity'3 can only be practically efficacious through the agency of faith. But so far as the concrete question is con- cerned,-as to whether the human individual is, as a particu- lar entity, immortal, and what that immortality consists in- this 'faith' leaves the matter absolutely undetermined. In other ways, too, Prof. Laurie reveals the sense of the insufficiency of the 'proof' of individual immortality. He 1 Syn., ii., p. 389. 2 Ibid., p. 384. 3 Ibid., p. 388.</page><page sequence="24">PROFESSOR LAURIE'S NATURAL REALISM. 207 points out that 'each Ego has its eternal destiny in its own hands," and that a given man may not be worthy of im- mortality at all. "The continuance of life beyond the grave may depend on the extent to which the potential in each man has here become actual": ' he who has not found eternal life here will not, it may be said, find it hereafter': 2 ' for aught we know one of the very marks of personal fitness for the life eternal is the living conviction which man has of the necessity and truth of that eternal life'.3 But a proof which is to be accepted can admit of no qualifying exceptions. The only hope of immortality on the basis of a rational demon- stration must consist in the universality of the conclusion. A probable conclusion may perhaps admit of exceptions; but a universal conclusion cannot; and a probable conclusion is not 'proof'. To admit that certain individuals may not be immortal is, once more, to make all logical coherence in the argument from the very start impossible; for we have thereby destroyed the universality of our premises, and, more- over, no one can settle what individuals are to be rejected. The truth is that the only safe ground on which Prof. Laurie's arguments can rest is the general proposition on -which he insists so strongly throughout his metaphysics- -that being is one and continuous throughout all its mani- festations. The permanence of the individual stands or falls -with that position. For immortality is a specific case or form of continuity, and the problem of immortality arises in rela- tion to this fundamental fact of continuity of being. The meaning we attach to immortality will depend entirely on the significance we attach to this fact of continuity. Con- tinuity is not merely a matter of time, for time is an aspect of continuity. Continuity may perhaps best be realised through the value and quality of spiritual life, and that is not a matter of time or of particular existence. As Prof. Laurie says to- wards the close of his great argument, " a man striving after union with God here and now is ipso facto making himself immortal, inasmuch as he is bringing his finite spirit within the very life of the eternal spirit, and is being borne along in the current of that which cannot die ".4 This is finely said, and seems the last word on the subject. For thereby we make immortality a quality of the life of the present, a quality essential to the ideal ends controlling the present, and as enduring as these ideal ends themselves. This is all man wants to make it worth while to surrender even his existence in the interests of the best, in the assurance that he is not throwing his life away. 1 Syn., ii.,.p. 384. 2lbid., p. 383. 3 Ibid., p. 389. 4 bid., p. 387.</page></plain_text>
