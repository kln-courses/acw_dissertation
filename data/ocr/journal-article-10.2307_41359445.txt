<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEDIEVAL INDIAN SCULPTURE By Dr. Stella Kramrisch, Lecturer in Indian Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art Because of the high state of preservation of a large number of Indian temples belonging to the period 800 A.D. to 1300 A.D. we must regard them as contributing one of the most substantial chapters to the whole history of Indian art. These temples are called " medieval " not only because they correspond in time to the medieval period of European history, but also because they show a certain similarity in content and method to those of western civilization. The medieval period in India, however, is characterized by its continuity with preceding eras ; the contrast, if any, with earlier ages lies in the more accentuated expression of certain forms. Tendencies observable previously reach their full development in this</page><page sequence="2">Oct. 20, 1939 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS I181 period and become its outstanding characteristics. This is more pronounced in the monuments of central and western India than in those of the east and south. The temples of northern India are chiefly found in the Himalayas, and they show evidence of the traditions of the mountain dwellers together with traces of Hellenistic characteristics. The temples on the plains and the lesser hills of India are free from these extraneous elements. The accentuation of certain forms of the Indian art tradition was caused by the influx into India of peoples from the north. No monuments belonging to the period immediately following the invasion of the Aryans have yet been discovered, and such works as are preserved from the third century b.c. show that Aryan influences had already blended with the indigenous. The migrations from the north of India during the first five hundred years of the Christian era, as well as the slow infiltrations of other peoples in the following centuries, have left their mark on the medieval art of India. The Kusanas and the Gurjars, with their settlement in " Gujarat," may be instanced as peoples who have exercised such influence. These infiltrations of peoples are another feature which the period shares with the European " medieval " period. No analogy, however, with the gap between Christian Europe and its pagan past exists in Indian art. The people from the north accepted the Indian tradition and doctrine, and thus the Indian past survives. It supplies the soil and the roots and the sap of even the smallest branch of medieval Indian art. The end of the medieval period is marked by the final and prolonged impact, from the north, of Islam, which by its iconoclastic attitude was destructive of actual monuments. Even so, the practice of religion went on, and wherever it survives to-day in the villages its performance belongs to the medieval, that is the traditional art of India. It must, however, be distinguished from the somewhat ephemeral attempts at religious practice made in the large modern towns. These by comparison are without a foundation, whereas the deeply rooted medieval or traditional practice is still alive in the country and it is this which produces the contemporary art of India. This traditional art now lacks patronage and demand, but during the first five centuries of the Christian era demand equalled supply. South India, where building activity was prolonged after the thirteenth century, is outside the limits of our consideration here ; it does not truly belong to our period, for although the content and method of art in South India have not radically changed, there is a deterioration in the quality of the sculptures. The buildings are over-massive and covered with statues which, although correct in their iconography, are meaningless in form. Tradition survives in iconography and in the crafts, and it gives renewed scope for planning and building, but its main expression, that of sculpture, completed its development during the thirteenth century. As far, therefore, as sculptural form is concerned " medieval " connotes a limit in time, and it is in sculpture that India has made her greatest artistic contribution to</page><page sequence="3">Ii82 journal of the royal society of arts Oct. 20, 1939 the world. The medieval Indian temple is a work of monumental sculpture. Its main part is invariably a small cubicle, the walls of which are thick and have projections which further increase the thickness. It culminates in the tower where it tapers up into amalaka or stupa. The highest type of temple is called a meru , the name of the world mountain. Fig. i. - Kandarya Mahadeva Temple , Khajuraho The interior is not spacious ; it is just large enough for the devotee to walk round the image or object of worship. The meru is a mountain-like monument with a small inner cavity ; it is not like an ordinary building space enclosed by walls, and therefore, is not, strictly speaking, a work of architecture. There may, however, be additional and more spacious halls in front of the sanctuary, each of them crowned by a steeple, so that the whole resembles an ascending ridge of mountains culminating in the main tower over the sanctuary.</page><page sequence="4">Oct. 20, 1939 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS I183 This graded ascent, as seen in a profile view of the exterior, corresponds to the progression of the devotee from the door of the temple to the innermost sanctuary. It symbolises the direction of his progress in a physical sense as he moves towards his goal, and also in the sense of spiritual experience as he progresses from without to within, from the lower to the higher. Not only is the whole area of temples, such as those in Khajuraho, raised on a high plinth ascended by steps ; there are also steps in the interior leading up to the sanctuary. The arrangement of the exterior is thus bound up with and reflects that of the interior. The whole temple is conceived as a work of sculpture. The devotee traverses it in accordance with instructions, all of which have their meaning, and he participates in that meaning every time the movements of his body and exercises of his mind comply with the instructions. So much for the approach along the body of the temple, should it be laid out with halls and passages, as it is in the case of major structures. The main representation of ascent, however, is seen in the spire of the sanctuary. It is essential and is complete in itself even if the preparatory halls, etc., are absent. Whatever its outline, whether pyramidal or curvilinear, it is divided into a series of levels (1 bkumi), which themselves also consist of storeys crowned by amalaka shapes and are thus reproductions of the whole tower. Each of these levels is occupied by miniature representations of storeyed mansions with large round windows, the abodes of celestials. Clustered along the slopes of the world -mountain are the dwellings of the various orders of beings. As the outer world, the " world- mountain," is beheld in its ascending order leading to the crowning point of the temple spire, so also is the inner world traversed through level upon level of spiritual experience, until the highest point of at-one-ment is reached. The structure of the outer and of the inner world is the same. This the devotee realises as he beholds the spire above the sanctuary. In order to behold it fully he must see it from all sides, he must walk round it ; keeping the monument to the right he completes the course prescribed by ritual. The ground plan of the sanctuary is a square, but projections of the walls give it a fretted outline. Externally, the projections on each of the four sides of the sanctuary break up the foursidedness. As he walks around the temple, profile succeeds profile, presenting to him constantly changing aspects as he progresses. The physical movement of his body and of his eye thus keeps pace with the activity of his mind, and corresponds closely with the structure of the temple. The outer aspect of the medieval Indian temple is thus the form of the devotee's approach towards ultimate spiritual experience. Its structure reflects the move- ment of his body and mind. Ritual and movement exactly correspond. The outcome is a monumental sculpture ; the surface of the temple body with its multiple profiles and figures forms a single whole just as much as the surface of a carved and modelled piece of sculpture. The difference between a carved figure of any kind and a medieval temple as a work of monumental sculpture is chiefly one of size. Beheld from without, the medieval Indian temple is monumental sculpture.</page><page sequence="5">1184 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 20, I939 Fig. 2. - Detail of Sikhar a, North Front , Lingaraja Temple , Bhuvaneswar</page><page sequence="6">Oct. 20, I939 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS I185 Its subject is cosmology and the ritual in which the devotee takes part. Its substance translates the worshipper's vision and movement into sculptured form. Beheld from within, the main sanctuary is a cavity, and the halls in front of it are the approach towards this most hidden cavity. There must be space to hold the pilgrims. This space, however, is without architectural meaning. It has no form. Darkness and pillars break up its continuity. It is more atmosphere than Fig. 3. - Interior of Nilkanthesvar a Temple , Udaipur space, charged with incense, the scent of offered flowers and the sound of bells. Situated within the thick walls of the " world-mountain,'' this cavity corresponds with the cavity of the heart within the human body. The dweller in both is the same divinity. Cave temples actually carved within the living rock are but few in this period. The natural mountain had become surpassed by the monumental sikhara of the temples built on the plains and on the hills. But the cavity and its darkness remain, and in it the devotee reaches his goal. It is approached through a door. Jambs, lintel and sill have their sculptures,</page><page sequence="7">Il86 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 20, I939 in which the meaning of each is explicit. In large temples there are two doors, the one a preliminary opening, while the other, the door of the sanctuary itself, effects the complete transition to the inmost cavity. In temples with only the garbhagriha and no accessory rooms, the one door effects the total initiation. It comes after the preliminary acts and rites of beholding and circumambulating the outer form of the temple and commands a halt before the severity of its orthogonal system. On its jambs are set out River goddesses. The pitcher of water which they carry may or may not be represented. By their presence alone Fig. 4. - Old Vaishnava Temple , Janjgir. they represent the life giving nature of water and fulfil their function of imparting ablution. These are associated with the moment of entry into the temple. They mark the time of commutation and the source of its results. Whether assisted or not by further helping figures, their position is at the bottom of the door jambs, which are entirely covered by connected figures, chiefly vegetation scrolls and human couples, life-giving and prolific shapes, having their origin in the water. With them and along the door jambs the devotee sees his earthly possibilities set out, and when he steps on the threshold he partakes in them, for he is himself then supported by the root stem of a lotus frequently carved in the centre of the sill. It carries all ; the human forms of the rivers and the life they give, explicit in the carved sculptures, and implicit in the spiritual</page><page sequence="8">Oct. 20, 1939 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS I187 experience of the devotee who stands on the threshold. In the centre of the lintel above him there is generally an effigy of the divinity itself the main image of which is inside the temple. Frequently, celestials portrayed as flying towards this effigy continue the vegetation rhythm of the door jambs. Framed by the door in which he stands, with the rite of ablution figuratively performed, the devotee himself stands in the centre of the tableau and is its axis, between the region of the water beneath and the heaven above. This is a moment of stillness and anticipation. The doors are thus, as it were, the static moments in the body of the temple, all else being in a state of flux. The outer form of the temple, as we saw, corresponds with the moments of ritual progression performed by the devotee. The devotee as he proceeds from the outskirts to the centre gives actuality to and enforces its meaning as a representation of the " world-mountain." The centre is kept near all the time he is walking round, and when he directly approaches towards it he passes across the door. Thus his movement round and his movement towards the centre are linked in the mass of the temple. But this is not the only way in which it forms a unity. The various profiles of the temple wall, and the spire, are covered with figures. The main positions on the central niches on each side are, in the case of a Siva temple, held by the nearest " relatives " of the god within the temple, his female spouse and their children, and are called parsva-devata , whereas in a Vishnu temple they are held by some of the avatars , i.e., the descents or manifestations of the divinity. They are visible collateral manifestations of the main image, the nature of which, to be understood and beheld in its totality, demands an awareness of the images outside on the temple wall simultaneously with the main image, as if from within its essence rays were shot through the thick temple walls to the places of the images outside. Figuratively, they derive their light from thence, and are the means of its shining forth out of the darkness of the cave into the light of day. These multiple images, aspects of the main divinity and its " relatives/* are accompanied by lesser and further particularised images. Between them, at definite places, are the images of the guardians of the eight directions which help to diffuse the radiation from within the cavity over the expanse of the temple as a representation of the 4 4 world-mountain." All the figures carved on the walls of the temple are images to the same extent as the main object of concentration within the sanctuary. They are made to conform with the concept held in the mind, but owing to the limits of human comprehension, the mind is capable of approaching only one aspect of the divinity at a time. Human powers of understanding vary according to various types of mind, and these variations have received confirmation in the existence of various sects which correspond to them, and give form to them, and which correspond in their turn to the forms of the respective images, such as Saiva or Vaishnava. Actually there is no difference between Siva in the form of Vishnu and Vishnu in the form of Siva. The at-one-ment which impresses its seal on those who behold</page><page sequence="9">Il88 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 20, I939 the images is the same in every case. The permanent effect is identical although the object seen differs according to circumstances. The actions and the attributes or qualities of the divinity all emanate from its being which embraces them all. They show themselves in variations in the countenance and size of the image. A static or dynamic setting, a benign or terrible expression, are all possible, and in order to give clear expression to them the attributes are given the shape of objects, mainly weapons, which the images carry in their hands. They have as many hands as are required to carry the attributes, one in each hand. Whatever anthropomorphic reference is resorted to in order to give the attributes explicit form, it has its place in the inwardly beheld image, but it has the function of a metaphor, and is freed from bodily connections. Hands or heads may be multiplied. Their number, in the image, is of equal importance with the functions which they are seen to carry out. They belong solely to the image which represents the form of the divinity beheld, and are withdrawn from any other actuality. Thus endowed with features, the main aspects of the divinities make themselves known. The images are shown either at rest or in movement. If they are at rest, that is, with the symmetry of an upright stance, their motionless upright stance within the sanctuary coincides with the central axis of the main shrine. This, as has already been said, stands for the " world-mountain/' that is, the hierarchy of existence, which has its mainstay and central axis in the upright stance of the image. This is not necessarily situated at the centre of the shrine ; wherever the image is established the same order and assurance hold good. It may have' its place on the wall of a temple or in a domestic shrine. The large number of almost uniform and monotonous artefacts of this type (Vishnu images, that is, images of the upholder of the universe) are reminders of the same fact. It is enough for them to be executed correctly, nothing more need be asked of them. They are artefacts parallel in shape to the Unga , of which the numbers are equally large. Simplicity of geometrical shape atones for the small aesthetic value of the linga. Other aspects of divinity are beheld in motion, either of the body alone without definite action, or implied in an activity. The various bends (bhanga) of the body show a swaying suspense of the weight of the body and limbs from the various joints, without effort or tension, akin to devices of vegetation, with their curves supported by the inner movement of their sap. To this extent they are emblematic of the course and the motion of the world ( jagat ). These anthropomorphic " symbolisms " in the making of the image are similar to the " attributes " in their relation to the whole ; they are external parts only and not the whole of the plastic form. The latter is consistent throughout the parts of which it is built up, and achieves its effect with the materials which they supply. The " vegetation " type of sculpture implies the upright, turgid and swaying varieties of images. It is not necessarily anthropomorphic in the selection of its shapes. Vegetation itself frequently supplies them. The carvings of the door</page><page sequence="10">Oct. 20, 1939 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS I189 jambs give ample illustration. Below are carved the river goddesses. Their stances, as a rule, are swaying like the element, the waters, which they " embody.' * Above them, vegetation creepers and scrolls continue this movement. It is their natural and also their conventional attitude. Human bodies are similar}^ interlaced, and their display is pervaded by an unending curvilinear flux. Animal shapes, too (s ardilla) , are sometimes part of this pattern. The swaying movement is emblematic of vegetative life, and is embodied in the Fig. 5. - Durga Mahisasur amar ditti, Khiching shape of gods inasmuch as these, too, take part in its course. In this vegetative form they appear more intimately linked with the motion of the world than by their anthropomorphic appearance. The latter belongs to their conception prior to and independent of their form as artefacts When they became subjects of art their implicit meaning was given visible expression. If a divinity is shown engaged in action this illustrates a definite event amongst his activities. Every activity in its turn represents a further particularised manifestation wThich is of equal importance in relation to the whole being of the</page><page sequence="11">1 190 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 20, 1 939 divinity as the attributes. For example the goddess Durga (Fig. 5) when killing the buffalo-demon fulfils an essential part of her being as a goddess. Accordingly, her name in that manifestation is " Durga-Mahisasura mardini." It is thought of as a manifestation ; it happens now and at every moment ; it is no longer an action Fig. 6. - From Temple of Sivaj i , Harasnath performed by the divinity, but one of the forms in which the divinity is beheld. The actual movements appear as if in suspense in the carved artefact, but they are given added strength thereby. Their gestures are pregnant with the movement of action condensed into one moment of visibility, a moment emblematic of the divinity's enduring potency. This charged moment, far from being static, is dynamic with the flux of the " vegetative form." The rarity of facial participation in any of the actions is due to the same cause.</page><page sequence="12">Oct. 20, 1939 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS II91 Usually the face remains mask-like and aloof even if shown with contorted traits, suggestive of fierce action. Psychology is no key, and emotion is not the source of such physiognomies. They are not expressive of any emotion directly. They Fig. 7. - Nagas , from Konaraka show it as it were reflected on the countenance, which is specially devised as a surface of reflection, a kind of mirror. The region to which medieval Indian sculptures belong is obvious from the cast of the faces. It is also reflected by the manner or style, that is, the varieties of execution. Such an infiltration from the daily life and its surroundings into the level of temple sculpture is not by way of deliberate imitation. It is spontaneous. The image, however, is complete, that is, fit for worship, even if no recourse whatever is had to the forms either of men, animals or vegetatives. Its shape</page><page sequence="13">1 1 92 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 20, I939 in the case of the lingay for example, is a geometrical body or figure. The equal value for purposes of worship of these geometrical cult objects (and they have no other value) requires us now to review them. They are pure symbols, and serve as a means of intellectual activity without the use of allusion or suggestiveness (though this may also be present). It is not a question here of any of the implications of corresponding shapes in nature, or in the works of men, be they phallic (as in the Unga) or religious (as in the outline of the temple enclosure, for instance, in the case of yantras). The cylindrical shape of the Unga reveals its function as the central pillar of the universe in a relief illustrative of the story of its manifestation (Fig. 6). Firmly established between the swaying stances of Vishnu and Brahma there is a shaft without beginning or end. Its downward extent is indicated by the downward flight of Vishnu, and its upward Fig. 8. - Head of a horse , Konaraka thrust by the ascent of Brahma. The myth illustrated by the actions of the demiurges on either side exemplifies the latent power of a seemingly static shape. It tells how in the darkness of cosmic night a fiery pillar arose out of the world ocean. Bewildered on account of its presence (each of the demiurges had considered himself the first and the only principle) the Brahma swan soars up to find its end, the Vishnu boar dives deep to fathom its depth. They seek in vain ; neither of them finds an end, and thus they realise the meaning of the fiery Siva pillar. In the relief the two demiurges on either side worship its upright shape, with hands joined and swaying bodies. A geometrical shape, a long and narrow cylinder, covers the entire middle axis of the carving. Anthropomorphic figures, full of movement, carry out the movement and meaning implied in its shape. Thus the myth is doubly visualized, implicitly in the simple geometrical shape, explicitly in the telling actions of the figures. The implicit visualization has a wider suggestiveness than the explicit one. The latter exemplifies and applies the inherent meaning to one event,</page><page sequence="14">Oct. 20, I939 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS II93 albeit of cosmic validity. The former preserves the integrity of this special meaning as well as of all the other meanings inherent in its form. The figured versions of the images are exemplifications, part-aspects of the total symbolism of the respective geometrical shape. Such is the two-fold and, as in the present example, simultaneous visualisation of one and the same concept of divinity. Such a method of visualisation is a function of art proper. The two-fold and simultaneous beholding of a god exists also, however, prior to art, as when, for instance, Siva is beheld along with Nandin, the goddess with her lion, and all the other divinities with their animal vahanas. In human and in animal shape, together or separately, these figures convey the same meaning, and they can be imaged so closely together that they coalesce, as in some of the avatars of Vishnu, a boar's or lion's head on a human body, whereas the lesser divinities carry a human head on an animal body (Fig. 7). Responses to one and the same spiritual experience give expression to it in various relations of shape and form. The perfect symmetry and proportion of a linga are of equal value with the canon of appearance to be observed in the making of anthropomorphic images and in animal representation. Thus in Fig. 8 the horse stands in emblematic relation with the sun and with the anthropomorphic image of Surya. By virtue of their position, all these varieties of sculptured form contribute to the sum total of the temple, as it was fully evolved in medieval India. DISCUSSION The Chairman said : Dr. Kramrisch has given us the philosophic and devotional basis of Indian art as manifested in the sculpture and architecture of different parts of India, and she has related these various phases to the immigration into India of peoples from Central Asia during the centuries between the beginning of the Christian era and the twelfth century. It is a very interesting and extremely comprehensive subject. For me the lecture has given a great deal of occasion for thought, and I am sure all of us would like to try and digest what she has told us. The following questions were then put to the lecturer and answered by her : - Q. The lecturer mentioned something about the northern and eastern type of sculpture in India, and I should be grateful for more information about that, and also about the northern and southern influences in architecture and sculpture. A. It is difficult to give greater detail without illustrations, and I can only indicate generally. Monuments are preserved extensively only from the ninth century. In the art of sculpture as well as in painting, we have to differentiate between that of the West and that of the East. We must also differentiate between the architecture of the North and that of the South. As far as sculpture is concerned the eastern type, which is closely allied to the southern, can be generally described as pure plastic and modelling, and the western type as the linear and all that goes with it with regard to the discipline of light and shade, etc. It would be quite impossible to give more details and to show the interaction of these trends, but after all it is the plastic and modelling which lies at the basis even of the westernmost monument on the soil of India.</page><page sequence="15">II94 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Oct. 20, 1 939 Q . One of the illustrations shown was, I think, of the Siva ling a. Am I right in supposing that it represents the principles of generation and creation ? A. I wanted to show that the purely geometrical shape of the linga, whatever its original meaning, is maintained throughout the centuries of Indian art and takes the place of a complete Siva image. The non-iconic image may be invested with one or four heads of Siva as he is beheld in the anthropomorphic way. The linga may be made of crystal or ether. Being made of ether it is invisible. The Chairman concluded : It is now my pleasant duty to thank Dr. Kramrisch for the extraordinarily learned, as well as interesting lecture she has given us. It must have meant a tremendous amount of trouble to collect all those slides and to find explanations for each of them. The lecture has given a great deal of food for thought for us all, and I am sure you will wish me to tender our thanks to Dr. Kramrisch for her lecture. The vote of thanks was carried unanimously, and the meeting terminated.</page></plain_text>
