<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rules of untouchability in ancient and medieval law books: Householders, competence, and inauspiciousness Mikael Aktor INTRODUCTION Some concepts remain alive in scholarly discourse without any clear justifica tion in terms of theoretical definition or demarcation. 'Untouchability' is such a concept?it has been justified on empirical criteria which are more rooted in folk traditions of social attitudes than in sociological consistency,1 and as such it lacks a clear theoretical basis. Untouchables are 'at the bottom/ but what demarcates this bottom from the Mow/ apart from being the last in a declining series, is not clear. Whether untouchable castes were placed at the bottom of the ethnographic tables of transactional ranking of the 1950s or were seen as embodying the highest degree of impurity in the Dumontian hierarchical structure that prevailed for the next couples of decades, they were not distin guishable as anything but the last of an inclusive continuum. The Br?hmanical literary traditions, the Dharmas?stra and the epics in particular, have undoubtedly been influential in forming the concept of untouch ability. In this article, J shall argue that at least as far as these Br?hmanical articulations are concerned, the concept of untouchability does rest on a fairly well-delimited paradigm. J hope to demonstrate that the precolonial Br?hmanical construction of 'untouchability' as it gradually emerged in ancient and medieval law books was not simply a part of a more inclusive complex of purity ideas but that it formed an exclusive set of rules referring to an exclusive set of social characters and situations. In connection with the subject of untouchability, I will also have the opportunity to touch on more general theoretical discussions about pollution and the transferability or nontransferability of karma.

But these texts are literary sources in which direct evidence of the actual historical, economic, and social conditions of these groups is very limited. Even the law literature, the Dharma s?stra, in which we find the most systematic account of the phenomenon, is not a source for the history of the untouchables but, at most, a source for Br?hmanical attitudes that to some extent have been influential in forming the later observed social practices. Our sources do not, therefore, recommend themselves to a limited focus on social facts alone, but rather direct us to be the more sensitive to the subtle ways in which religious, ritual, political, and economic concerns are inextricably intertwined. This interconnectedness of values related to status (for example, religion and purity) and to power (economic and political concerns) is?as is well known from previous critiques?a blind spot in Dumontian structural studies. One of the most constructive of these critiques argues that a dichotomy of auspicious ness and inauspiciousness has to be taken into account as a supplement to the hierarchical polarity of purity and impurity, if the complex relationships of status and power values that are expressed in literary accounts, as well as in actual social practice, are to be adequately represented. Ronald Inden contributed what I believe is an important observation: The condition of personal purity (suci) was concerned with the 'competence' (adhik?ra) of a master to act with respect to his domain. Acts of purification increased or restored a person's competency. So, for example, a man tempo rarily lost his competence to perform rituals and make gifts when his father died, a woman lost her competence to cook during her menstrual period. The relative degrees of purity of persons by caste, gender, and the like, referred to the relative competencies to act with respect to the domain of the 'social' whole, historically a kingdom or local cult, to which they belonged (1985: 34). By drawing attention to the notion of adhik?ra, Inden points to important evidence that challenges the validity of assigning a radical split between status and power in South Asian precolonial social paradigms. Adhik?ra, the ritually established right and responsibility to act with respect to particular domains (Lariviere 1988), contains at the same time notions centered around purity and notions of power?namely, that power which follows from being a competent agent and from being entitled to the results of these acts, including the</page><page sequence="3">Rules of untouchability in law books I 245 economic as well as the political and soteriological, results.2 Seen from the perspective of the ritualism of the law books, adhik?ra highlights the interdependence between the purity that is demanded of a competent human agent and the auspicious results that follow from such pure actions in the form of wealth and power. The basic polarity here is that between human and divine agency. Human agency has limited power but possesses a moral-ritual potency that is generated by actions that are either in accordance with dharma (good potency) or in opposition to dharma (evil potency). Divine or cosmic agency is all-powerful, but it is so in response to the moral-ritual potency of human acts. What divine agency returns in the form of human conditions of existence?whether fertility or infertility, health or disease, wealth or poverty?happens according to the dh?rmika quality of human acts. Reduced to its essence, it is a relation between 'visible' (drsta) human endeavors, on the one hand, and the 'invisible' (adrsta) connections that guarantee that such endeavors bear fruit in the form of fertility, health, and wealth, on the other. As such, it logically follows that the economically and politically oppressed are considered inherently inauspicious. Unintentional poverty is itself a sign of inauspiciousness. According to the definition of the ?uddhikaumud?, a sixteenth-century digest of purity rules, purity is the state of 'being fit for performing the rituals that are known from the Vedas' (p.l)?that is to say, purity is a prerequisite, a 'felicity condition,' of ritual action.3 Ritual, in turn, is a paradigmatic human activity. If the gods perform rituals, they do so only in accordance with the anthropomor phism that is characteristic of a narrative, epic literature. The paradigmatic activity of the gods is not to perform rituals but to receive sacrifices and to return auspicious results in the form of wealth, fertility, and good health?or the corresponding inauspicious results if people neglect the sacrifices and other rituals.4 It therefore follows that we see the axis of purity as related to human agency and that of auspiciousness to divine or cosmic agency. If we reconsider the elements which have been characterized by T. N. Madan (1985) and Fr?d?rique Marglin (1985, 1988) as belonging to the domain of the auspicious inauspicious axis (elements related to time, both in the sense of astronomic cycles and life cycles such as those that surround food and fertility), we shall see that they are all dependent on factors beyond the scope of human agency. At the same time, it is precisely these events that are important for the prosperity of the personal and collective domains to which individual persons are linked by their respective adhik?ras. Of central importance in the present analysis of untouchability as related in the law books is the notion of adhik?ra and the distinction between purity and auspiciousness. It may be argued, however, that this strategy lacks empirical</page><page sequence="4">246 / Mikael Aktor justification in the texts, since a clear terminology of auspiciousness is rarely found in them. Generally speaking, we look in vain in the Dharmas?stra?where all seems to be expressed within the purity idiom?for terms like subha or m?ngala. However, while the Dharmas?stra is clearly demarcated by its main subject areas, it was itself dependent on other genres in which concerns for auspiciousness were much more explicit; it presupposed a knowledge of time and astrology as necessary preconditions of ritual success. We therefore find that M?dhav?c?rya, the South Indian mid-fourteenth-century author of the Par?sara m?dhaviya (the texts from which I have gathered most of my material), also wrote the K?lanirnaya (Kane 1968-77, 1: 780-81), a treatise on time and astrology and their ritual significance.5 BASIC CHARACTERISTICS Untouchability has always consisted of a complex of several different avoid ances. The segregation of untouchable groups was not absolute but negotiable in relation to two conflicting interests. The first interest was to receive certain services characterized by the removal of impurity from personal and common domains, while the second was to avoid the polluting influence entailed by these services. It was also likely the case that the services that were demanded from untouchable groups consisted increasingly of unskilled manual labor, and the regulation of contact with these groups therefore served as a method of isolating and preserving such an unskilled labor force. These efforts seem to be related to attitudes towards ??dra artisans. As a result of expanding trade and urbanization, such artisans had gradually gained economic influence (Sharma 1990: 199-201, 262-68). Thus, expressions of discomfort about such 'rich' S?dras become part of the Br?hmanical stereotype of the ??dras (that is, Manusmrti 10.129). Through careful observance of the rules of untouchability and social segregation, a similar upward mobility of untouchable castes could be prevented. The achievement of the aforementioned ends necessitated both interaction and segregation at the same time. The emphasis was, therefore, not so much on strict exclusion but rather on what went on along the boundary between the untouchables and the twice-born and on the many ways in which this boundary could be crossed from both sides. In Pata?jaIPs commentary (from around 150 BCE) on a rule in P?nini's grammar?among the oldest sources for the interaction between the C?ndalas and the upper varnas?the exclusion of the C?ndalas is defined not by</page><page sequence="5">Rules of untouchability in law books I 247 segregation from villages and settlements (which was not demanded at this stage) but by the rule that food vessels used by the C?ndalas could not be used by others even after the vessels had been washed (Mah?bh?sya 1.475.2-10). This rule?the avoidance of the exchange of food vessels (apapatratva)?was also applied in the law books. Manusmrti 10.51 explicitly designates the C?ndalas and the Svapacas as apap?tras. Medh?tithi, the ninth-century commentator on this text, discussed how food could be distributed to the C?ndalas and the Svapacas in such a way that there would be no exchange of food vessels: either it had to be given in earthen vessels which were thrown away afterwards, or in vessels held by a third person or placed on the ground, or in broken vessels. Pata?jali's discussion, as well as the later elaborations in Manusmrti and its commentaries, shows how exclusion and segregation boil down to pragmatic questions regarding the regulation of concrete transactions. The concern was with safeguarding and regulating a necessary interaction and not with prohibiting it altogether. In this sense, the untouchables were in an ambiguous position. They did not stand outside the community of the four vantas but at its margins. From this vantage point, they were in a position to perform tasks that were necessary for the ritual and political constitution of the community by disposing of the impurity that was fatal to the competencies of its members. For this service, they in turn might have received food. WHO AND WHAT IS UNTOUCHABLE? There is some evidence in the Vedic literature that untouchability as a minimal but distinct complex of avoidances was first practiced within the domestic sphere, particularly in connection with menstruation, before it was projected onto interactions at the demographic level (see Taittir?ya Br?hmana 3.7.1.9; Taittir?ya Samhit? 2.5.1.5-6; Kane 1968-77, 2: 803). Although a clear distinc tion between the two case*?the temporarily untouchable persons in the family and the permanently untouchable groups in the village?is not absent in later texts (see, for instance, Visnusmrti 5.104-5),6 we need to understand them in their totality. P. V. Kane already stressed this point: Those who are not familiar with ancient or even modern Hindu notions must be warned against being carried away by the horror naturally felt at first sight when certain classes are treated as untouchable. The underlying notions of untouchability are religious and ceremonial purity and impurity. A man's nearest and dearest women relatives such as his own mother and wife or</page><page sequence="6">248 / Mikael Aktor daughter are untouchable to him during their monthly periods. To him the most affectionate friend is untouchable for several days when the latter is in mourning due to death in the latter's family (1968-77, 2: 170). Notwithstanding the apologetic tone, Kane is right with regard to the inter relation between these practices.7 In the law books this is apparent by the manner in which quite different untouchable categories are classified together and rules of avoidance are treated across such categories. Two early (250 150 BCE)8 lists of untouchable persons and things became normative for later similar lists. One is Baudh?yanadharmas?tra 1.5.9.5, which reads: 4A Br?hmana who has touched a memorial tree [in memory of dead persons], a funeral pyre, a sacrificial post [for binding the victims], a C?ndala, [or] a seller of the Veda [who stipulates certain wages before giving instructions in the Vedas] should enter the water with his clothes on.' The other is Gautama dharmas?tra 14.30: 'In case of touching an outcast, a C?ndala, a woman in confinement, a menstruating woman, [and] a person who has touched a corpse or any of these, a man should purify himself by bathing with his clothes on.' Apart from the persons and things listed in these two texts, animals form a third group. Taken together, and including the other ancient Dharmasutras, persons include: the C?ndala, representing the permanent untouchability of the lowest castes; the woman in confinement; the menstruating woman; the dead person; the person who touches a dead person; the outcast (patita), that is, the severe violator of moral laws, such as a Br?hmana-killer and the Veda seller. Among animals only the dog, which is particularly associated with the C?ndalas and the Svapacas (literally dog-cookers), is mentioned in the early texts (?pastambadha rmas?tra 1.5.15.16; Baudh?yanadharmas?tra 1.5.11.39 ; Gautamadharmas?tra 14.32; Vasisthadharmas?tra 23.33). Among objects nothing else is mentioned besides those items mentioned above in Baudh?yana dharmas?tra 1.5.9.5. Focusing on the C?ndala, our prototype for later untouchables, the avoidances to be observed according to the same early texts (the Dharmasutras) are: Avoidance of physical contact: (/) Avoidance of sexual contact (Baudh?yanadharmas?tra 2.2.4.12-13; Vasisthadharmas?tra 23.39-^1). (2) Avoidance of touch (?pastambadharmas?tra 2.1.2.8; Baudli?yana dharmas?tra 1.5.9.5; Gautamadharmas?tra 14.30; Vasisthadharmas?tra 23.33). Avoidance of contact through the senses: (3) Avoidance of contact through sight (?pastambadharmas?tra 2.1.2.8).</page><page sequence="7">Rules of untouchability in law books I 249 (4) Avoidance of contact through hearing (during recitation) (Vasistha dharmas?tra 23.34). (5) Avoidance of contact through speech (?pastambadharmas?tra 2.1.2.8). Avoidance of contact through things exchanged: (6) Avoidance of contact through food (Baudh?yanadharmas?tra 2.2.4.14; Vasisthadharmas?tra 20.16-17). (7) Avoidance of contact through exchange of food vessels (?pastamba dharmas?tra 1.1.3.25, 1.5.16.30, 1.7.21.I7).9 (8) Avoidance of contact through gifts (Baudh?yanadharmas?tra 2.2.4.14). Avoidance of contact during religious activities: (9) Presence of a C?ndala as a hindrance to recitation (?pastambadharma s?tra 1.3.9.15; Gautamadharmas?tra 16.19; Vasisthadharmas?tra 13.11). (10) Glance of a C?ndala as spoiling the sr?ddha food (Gautamadharmas?tra 15.24). PROLIFERATIONS In the centuries that followed, the list of untouchable persons and things, as well as that of avoidances, proliferated considerably. One category now included consists of persons who undergo ?sauca, the period of purification after the death of a relative. This group generally includes all relatives within seven or five generations in both ascending and descending order of, respectively, the father's and the mother's line (see Kane 1968-77, 2: 452-58). Medieval commentators took the untouchability of these people for granted (Mit?ksara 3.30). Untouchability is simply one of four criteria by which ?sauca is defined by Haradatta on Gautamadharmas?tra 2.5.1, with the other three being the suspension of the right to perform rituals, of the possibility for others to partake of one's food, and of receiving one's gifts?all criteria that had long attached to the C?ndalas. Other smrtis added other categories. M?dhav?c?rya quotes verses that add to both of the two normative lists in the Dharmasutras (Baudh?yanadharmas?tra 1.5.9.5; Gautamadharmas?tra 14.30). Commenting on Par?sarasmrti 2.6.24, M?dhav?c?rya quotes two verses attributed to Devala that clearly take the list in Gautamadharmas?tra 14.30 and its parallel in Manusmrti 5.85 as their model: A man who has touched a ?vap?ka, an outcast, a cripple, a fool, a corpse</page><page sequence="8">250 / Mikael Aktor burner, both parents undergoing the impurity of childbirth, a woman over taken by menstruation, or the dogs, cocks, and hogs of the village is purified as soon as he has bathed fully, including his head, and with his clothes on.1 ' A little further he quotes Caturvimsatimata (another incomplete text; Derrett 1973: 39), which has a list similar to Baudh?yanadharmas?tra 1.5.9.5. The memorial tree and the Veda-seller are omitted, but instead it includes the temple priest (devalaka), whose prestige is very low from the point of view of the Veda-learned sastra authors.12 A relation to the state is suggested in Atrismrti 267 (see also Kane 1968-77, 2: 384), which adds the 'barbarian' foreigner (mleccha) to the list. Vij?anesvara on Y?jnavalkyasmrti 3.30 quotes other smrtis which extend the lists further; for instance, by the funeral smoke, a priest who sacrifices for a whole village, the seller of the soma plant, the shadow of a ?vapaka as well as several animals. And we could go on finding peculiar additions. Atrismrti 277c-79b makes crows, camels, and jackals untouchable to women during menstruation. In addition, there are certain situations that render people momentarily untouchable to each other. According to Par?sarasmrti 2.7.20c-22b, a person who is eating or who has not yet cleaned himself after the meal is impure (ucchista) and untouchable to others in the same situation. With respect to untouchable castes, it is more significant that Caturvarga cint?mani (p.38) lists sixteen groups, most of which are occupational (see also Kane 1968-77, 4: 115n264). They are: washermen, leather workers, dancers, reed and bamboo workers, fishermen, Medas (several polluting occupations; see Kane 1968-77, 2: 92), Bhillas (mountain people), goldsmiths, Sauvikas (possibly Sauvidas: attendants on women's apartments), blacksmiths, stone cutters, barbers, carpenters, oil grinders, butchers, and wine dealers. All these groups are labeled as 'C?ndalas living in the village,' and the text specifies what this means in terms of avoidances: Wise people avoid looking at, touching, or talking to these persons. Moreover, they do not wish to hear them speak or to see them during the time of bathing, eating, or performing japa, homa, and worship. The sun is to be looked at in case of seeing them, and a man should abandon his meal if these things happen during that time. In case of talking with them, he should wash both ears well with his hands, and having finally talked with a Br?hmana, he is freed from the defect (Caturvargacint?mani pp. 38-39). The avoidances follow the paradigm of the Dharmasutras (see above) in distin guishing between what happens in ritual contexts, during which the results of pollution are more serious (even hearing is damaging), and at other times.</page><page sequence="9">Rules of untouchability in law books I 251 This proliferation of occupational untouchable groups as listed in Caturvarga cint?mani is remarkable in that it moves beyond the previously delimited unskilled services of the C?ndala (working at the cremation grounds and serving as executioners and scavengers) (Manusmrti 10.55-56; Vaikh?nasasm?rtas?tra 10.14) and includes the seven occupations of the so-called Mow-born' (antyaja), that is, washerman, leather worker, dancer, reed and bamboo worker, fisherman, Meda, and Bhilla (see Kane 1968-77, 2: 70). Not only do the untouchable categories proliferate, the complex of avoidances is also extended during the medieval period (from about sixth century CE). Added to the list of avoidances in the ancient Dharmasutras, we find rules that clearly segregate the C?ndalas from the villages and cities (Vaikh?nasasm?rta s?tra 10.14). It is stressed, however, that this segregation only pertains to their place of living, not to work. On the contrary, the texts deal increasingly with how contact with the C?ndalas is to be met with inside the village. This is paralleled by more detailed descriptions of the duties of the C?ndalas within villages and cities. The image of the C?ndala presented in the Vaikh?nasa sm?rtas?tra, dated to the fourth century CE by Kane (1968-77, 1: 260) and probably even later according to J. Duncan Derrett (1973: 39), is an example of the fully elaborated stereotype of an untouchable village C?ndala: A C?ndala is begotten by a S?dra on a Br?hmana woman.13 He wears orna ments of lead or black iron, a leather thong tied round his neck, and a cymbal fixed to his girdle. He wanders from place to place and is excluded from all rites. In the morning, he removes the dirt on the road and elsewhere in villages and other places and takes it outside. He should dwell far away outside the village together with his own kind. After midday he cannot enter a village. If he does, he has to be punished corporally by the king. Otherwise the king incurs the guilt of murdering a learned Br?hmana (Vaikh?nasasm?rtas?tra 10.14). Other occupations for the C?ndalas mentioned in earlier texts include hunting, working on the cremation grounds, executioner (Manusmrti 5.131, 10.55-56; Visnusmrti 16.11, 23.50; Yaj?avalkyasmrti 1.192), and security functions such as guarding frontiers (Arthas?stra 2.1.5), searching for robbers in the villages (N?radasmrti 14.25), and participating in certain military units (gulma) (K?ty?yanasmrti 681). Commenting on Manusmrti 10.55, Medh?tithi (ninth century; Derrett 1973: 49) gives us a parallel picture of the C?ndalas on duty in the larger city: During the day they walk about on business, that is, either on their own</page><page sequence="10">252 / Mikael Aktor business, such as buying and selling, or on the king's business, for instance when there is a public show or a festival in the town. At such occasions, they should be marked according to royal order by such marks as the thunderbolt, and so on, which are ordered by the king, or by the axe or hoe, which they carry on their shoulders for the purpose of executing criminals. Along with the increasing need for the C?ndala's professional presence within villages and cities, rules regulating the spatial limits of contact became more complicated. Par?sarasmrti, for instance, does not at ail prescribe where the C?ndalas have to live. Instead it gives detailed instructions about how to purify the house of a Br?hmana if a C?ndala has stayed inside it without his knowledge (Par?sarasmrti 2.6.34-38b; for an analysis, see Aktor 2000: 144-48). Thus the sphere of possible contact comes closer. This is reflected in the way in which the avoidance of touch itself proliferates. Apart from direct touch, there are detailed rules about contact through common facilities, such as roads and beds (Par?sarasmrti 2.6.23), particularly when food is involved (Br?hmanas eating fruit from a tree touched by the C?ndalas in Atrismrti 178-83b). Even without any material medium, untouchability is extended to pollution at a distance that is precisely measured out: If a Br?hmana happens to get closer to a C?ndala than four yugas (about three and a half meters), he has to take a bath (Par?sarasmrti 2.12.54-55; Mit?ksara 3.30). Some texts, as previously mentioned, also prescribe the untouchability of the shadow of a C?ndala or ?vapaka (Atrismrti 288c-89b), although this is controversial, since shadows in general are declared pure according to the authority of Manusmrti 5.133, Visnusmrti 23.52, and Y?jnavalkyasmrti 1.193. Note also the duty of the Can?ala, mentioned in the quote from Vaikh?nasasm?rtas?tra above, to make himself visually and audibly known by wearing, for instance, a leather thong and beating a cymbal. Another important avoidance is the restricted access to the wells and other water sources of the high castes. It is not that the C?ndalas are explicitly prohibited from drawing water from the common well but that the twice-born are warned against drinking water from wells dug by the C?ndalas or water which has come into contact with their pitchers (Mit?ksara 1.192; Par?sara smrti 2.6.25-29). Apart from these proliferations of untouchable characters and avoidances associated with them, we also see a differentiation of various situations that aggravate the pollution of untouchables. As noted, the impurity after eating was one such situation. Parallel to this are the rules that prescribe specific purifica tion in the case a man has been touched by a C?ndala while he is still impure after defecation (Par?saram?dhaviya 2, 1: 110, 2, 2: 143). For menstruating women, in particular, the preoccupation with purification is overwhelming.</page><page sequence="11">Rules of untouchability in law books I 253 Detailed rules are given which account for every possible combination of the varnas in case menstruating women happen to touch each other (Par?sarasmrti 2.7.11c-15b). And if such a woman is touched by a C?ndala, then there are specific penances depending on which day of the menstrual cycle the incident occurred, the first day being considered the worst (Parasaram?dhav?ya 2, 1 : 162; for similar rules, see Leslie 1994). Thus various types of untouchability are combined. WHY UNTOUCHABLE? What are the patterns behind all these diverse untouchable categories and diverse avoidances? First there is a spatial pattern. All the untouchable characters?cripples, C?ndalas, criminals, menstruating women, foreigners? are distributed according to the different spatial spheres of activity and competence in which the high-caste male householder pursues his goals. At the center of the sphere is his own body. This is a domain of its own because the ritual competency of the householder as an agent within larger spheres depends on the state of his body. But first and foremost he is the master of a home with family, livestock, and so on. Homes are organized in village communities of transacting occupational groups?or in larger urban centers like the royal city. All these form part of the king's territory, the country that is his personal domain. Second, there is the pattern by which all these untouchable categories are distinct from other categories that merely denote impurity. This is the pattern in terms of a distinction between purity and auspiciousness, between human agency and types of agency that are beyond the human domain. These extra human domains are particularly related to human prosperity, since prosperity cannot be guaranteed by human agency alone. Whether one's wife delivers a son or a daughter, whether the rains fall as expected, and whether one's enemies are successful in their attacks are all matters in which divine agency has a determining role. Let us now examine these two factors while reviewing the main untouchable categories. The overall perspective will be that of the central character of the law books, the male Br?hmana householder. From this perspective, it will be apparent that untouchable categories are organized in relation to those spatial domains through or within which the householder operates (the body, the home, the village, the town, and the country). My hypothesis is that the segregation and untouchability of all these categories is generated initially by the process of</page><page sequence="12">254 y Mikael Aktor ritualization through which each domain is constituted as a productive adhik?ra sphere, a field for realizing that to which one has competence. The ritualized body is the agent, whereas the other domains?home, village, and so on?are the inclusive 'complex agencies' in which it participates through economic or political transactions.14 As a second step, this paradigm is utilized pragmatically in the special case of the C?ndala as a motivation and means for controlling his labor. Since the Dharmas?stra literature is not very articulate on this socio economic utilization, a full study of the issue will have to be based on a much broader range of sources. The focus of this article is therefore on the first step. Ritualization is 'fundamentally a way of doing things to trigger the perception that these practices are distinct and the associations that they engender are special' (Bell 1992: 220). By setting themselves off from other practices, rituals create situations that presuppose the working of ontological, mythical, cosmo logical, or ideological causes?causes that have been axiomatically set off already from the more familiar causalities of everyday life. By the ritual enactment of these forces participants are empowered as agents with special competencies. This basic differentiation of one practice in relation to other practices and of special agents as opposed to ordinary agents is facilitated through using the oppositions that are generated by the body's proprioception and its perceptions of the surroundings (such as inside/outside, high/low, and clean/unclean). These oppositions are then projected onto the ritualized objects (body, home, and so on) as a paradigm for inclusion and segregation: the 'low' or 'impure' is segregated to a position 'outside' the ritualized field whether by actual segregation or through bracketing by avoidances, while the 'higher' or 'purer' elements are kept inside. And it is only by this process of segregation that the body emerges as an empowered agent, the home as a proper sphere of ownership, and the village and country as rightful spheres of polity. The first domain to consider is the body itself. Impurity in general, and untouchability in particular, have been explained by Louis Dumont as 'the irruption of the biological into social life' (1980: 61, see also 47). This is in general agreement with one of the basic principles of social symbolism as formulated by Mary Douglas (1984: 114-15), namely that substances that cross the boundaries of the body are charged with implicit meanings derived from the attention to social boundaries. However, this explanation is unable to account for the distinction in the Dharmas?stra between substances and situations that are merely 'impure' and others that are associated with untouchability. Let us therefore look at these latter situations. According to Par?sarasmrti 2.7.20c-22b, diners who have not yet cleaned themselves after their meal are untouchable to other diners in the same state. And, in general, there is a strong taboo against exchanging anything that has</page><page sequence="13">Rules of untouchability in law books I 255 been in contact with someone while he or she is eating. The manner in which such considerations also govern social contact between different castes is very well described and was one of the most fruitful subject areas of South Asian social anthropology of the 1950s. R. S. Khare (1976), in line with the social symbolism of Dumont and Douglas, explained these food systems in terms of 'the exclusivity of the saliva' (8). However, according to the Dharmas?stra texts, saliva is excluded from having polluting qualities outside the food contexts. Spit that flies from the mouth during conversation does not pollute the listener (?pastambadharmas?tra 1.16.11-13; Manusmrti 5.141; Par?sarasmrti 2.7'.32/Par?saram?dhaviya 2, 1: 186). Saliva is also missing from the list of the body's twelve impurities in Manusmrti 5.135. It is, therefore, not saliva as such but its role in the food process that is emphasized by rules of untouchability. The nourishment of the body is the primary concern, and it determines which of the elements from the householder's own body is associated with untouchability. The fact that there are only two other bodily products that are mentioned in connection with untouchability?the feces and urine, while there is no mention of blood, sweat, sperm, hair, nails, or mucus?confirms this notion. For instance, in a discussion of different degrees of pollution of the soil (verses attributed to Devala, cited in Par?saram?dhaviya 2, I: 193-94), human feces are classified not merely as 'dirt' (mala) but among the worst kind of pollutants (the amedhya, the ritually impure). Dead bodies and the C?ndalas are similarly classified, and, as previously indicated, both were classified as untouchable according to the old lists in the Dharmasutras. Furthermore, food that has been in contact with feces or urine is equated with the food of the C?ndalas (Par?saram?dhaviya 2, I: 365). We may, therefore, agree with Douglas when she states that contact with feces represents a 'descent in the caste structure' as part of 'a symbolic system, based on the image of the body, whose primary concern is the ordering of a social hierarchy' (1984: 123, 125). However, before we accept this interpretation, we should?in line with the overall aim of the Dharmas?stra?try to understand the whole process from a ritual point of view. Apart from the many rules regulating the food process, the process itself is explained in ritual terms. According to this ritualism, food depends on the cosmic cycle that connects the oblations of food offered at the daily agnihotra ritual (fire sacrifice) through the smoke, with rain, vegetation, and new food (Manusmrti 3.76; Kane 1968-77, 2: 680). This is a ritualized cycle in which there is no place for excreted waste products like feces and urine, which become, so to speak, 'segregated' or bracketed off. This is a typical ritualization of a natural process in the sense that it constructs an in-out, right-wrong, or good-bad polarity between elements that are in fact naturally inseparable. Through this ritualization, the food cycle becomes strengthened as</page><page sequence="14">256 / Mikael Aktor an ontological and hence a necessary order of things, which guarantees the continuation of the cycle. To ritualize the food process is to take its basic uncertainty into account, its dependence on auspicious conditions beyond the control of humans. It is a ritual control that highlights the food process as the central condition of bodily prosperity. Starting with the householder's body and extending to his home, segregation and untouchability pertain to a similar prosperity process. The idiom here is not nourishment but kinship, and the rules of untouchability are directed, accord ingly, at the women of the house and at death. According to classical medical texts (Leslie 1994: 67-69), conception takes place when the male seed unites with the 'female seed' (sonita), which is the uterine blood. Conception cannot take place during the first three days of menstruation, when the flow of this uterine blood is 'out of control.' But for twelve or sixteen days after this critical period the woman is *in season' (rtu) and fit for conception. If she becomes pregnant, the fetus blocks the downward passage of the blood; thus she has no menstruation during her pregnancy. Her menstruation is a sign of her infertility. Although the medical tradition does not express itself in terms of pollution (Leslie 1994: 69), the situation it describes makes the interpretation of dharma s?stra obvious. The menstrual blood is inauspicious and polluting because of the infertility it is evidence of (Leslie 1994: 75). Like feces, menstruation is seen as a negative element of a prosperity cycle in which it is itself an intimate part. When the woman gives birth she is again untouchable, and I would interpret this untouchability in terms of the initial vulnerability of the mother and the newborn, a situation that is an unavoidable part of prosperity and, like fertility/infertility, depends on forces outside the sphere of human agency. Death, according to one possible interpretation, renders the whole home untouchable for the period of ?sauca, as the sapinda relatives (the closest relatives) are all part of the process of dying by their relation to the physical body of the deceased. This interpretation is based on the explanation according to which sapinda should be understood as 'having the same [bodily] particles, that is the same body' (Mit?ksara 1.52; Kane 1968-77, 2: 452). The sapinda relatives simply share the same body. The segregation (?sauca) lasts until the dead person has passed from the unsafe and intermediate state as a pr?ta (departed spirit) to that of being able to enjoy the offered rice balls?the state that eventually enables the dead to be installed as an ancestor (pitr) at the sapindikarana ceremony (see Kane 1968-77, 4: 262, 265, 520-23). The untouchability of the family, therefore, coincides with the kinship crisis that the immediate period after death entails. When, after ?sauca, the dead person has himself been properly 'segregated' in the form of another body able to enjoy the offerings, death no longer resides in the home and the family members are</page><page sequence="15">Rules of untouchability in law books I 257 purified. Other untouchable categories pertaining to the home are also related to kinship. These include that type of C?ndala that is the result of a sagotra relation, in which the partners belong to the same lineage (Par?saram?dhaviya 2, 1: 306), and that outcast (patita) who has 'violated his guru's bed' (that is, who has had sexual relations with one of the wives of the preceptor, a relation which tends to be incestuous, since the guru is one's own father, either in fact or by interpretation). However, as the patita in general is segregated from the village and not simply from the house, the case of this latter sinner is ambiguous. In any event, the untouchability rules of the home reveal that the power of the master of the house depends upon his duties in terms of kinship. The untouchability of the home brackets off elements that, although they are intimate parts of the kinship sphere, are seen as negative, critical, or illegitimate in relation to the proper kinship expectations of high-caste householders. The untouchables of the village or town are the C?ndalas (and similar groups, such as Svapacas or Pulkasas?these terms seem more or less interchangeable) and people who have become patitas due to severe sins. 1 shall treat these two groups separately. The permanently untouchable (the C?ndalas, for instance) are part of a set of practices that are related to the prosperity of the village or town communities. These communities depend on occupational transactions between its various groups. AH are instructed to pursue their proper professions diligently, and of course, this is of importance for the economic welfare of the area. Although all professions are in fact integral parts of this interaction, some are not recognized as contributing to it in any other sense than as a necessary evil (just as defecation is not recognized as part of the sacrifice/food cycle but only as a waste product caused by it). In a similar vein, the professional function of the C?ndala is to remove the most polluting waste that is produced by the villagers in their homes and through their work, particularly in connection with cremation and litter in the streets (Vaikh?nasasm?rtas?tra 10.14). In villages that fall under royal jurisdiction, the C?ndala is also responsible for the imprisonment and execution of criminals, although this service might have been centralized in larger urban centers (Manubh?sya 10.55; Manusmrti 10.56). All these jobs comprise a low status, negative aspect of the professional life that makes a community prosper. Although they are necessary for the welfare of the community, these jobs are associated with inauspicious forces, such as death and crime, and are therefore not recognized as part of a common sphere of mutual transactions. In fact, the C?ndalas are explicitly excluded from the common sphere of mutual transactions. ?pastambadharmas?tra 1.7.21.5-6 forbids Br?hmanas to make any transactions, such as trade with patitas and apap?tras (the C?ndalas, Svapacas, and other untouchables), even during critical times</page><page sequence="16">258 / Mikael Aktor when Br?hmanas are allowed to live by trade with other groups. Similarly, Manusmrti 10.53 states that the C?ndalas and Svapacas should only make transactions among themselves. The C?ndalas are, therefore, not seen as making use of 'transactions' within a larger, mutual social economy but as providing obligatory services that must be carried out by people who are spatially segregated from the villagers. As an occupational group in the professional life of the village or city community, the position of the C?ndalas is structurally analogous to that of the menstruating woman in relation to kinship or saliva in relation to nutrition: a necessary part of the actual paradigm, but segregated from the ritualized version of it. In the technical sense of Gautamadharmas?tra 21.4-5 an outcast (patita) is a person who, after committing severe sins, is deprived of the right to perform and to benefit (in the sense of soteriological rewards) from the rituals and work that follow from his birth and initiation as a twice-born. That is to say, it is a person who, for a period of time, has lost the adhik?ra for the activities that pertain to hisj?ti (not only in the sense of 'caste' but also of kinship), including, it seems, the economic rights connected with it (Derrett 1962: 39-40; Kane 1968-77, 3: 616). But Xhej?ti itself, that is, the membership in these groups, is not lost if the sinner is willing to undergo the prescribed penance. During this observance the sinner has to live outside the village and is untouchable (?pastambadharmas?tra 1.10.29.8; Baudh?yanadharmas?tra 2.1.2.18; Gautamadharmas?tra 14.30). Loss of j?ti, that is, excommunication, only happens if the sinner refuses to undergo the penance (Hardatta on Gautamadharmas?tra 20.1 ; Manubh?sya 11.181; Mit?ksara 3.294; Kane 1968-77, 2: 388, 3: 615). In other words, unlike the C?ndalas who are permanently confined to the periphery or altogether outside of the village or town community (and are further restricted by avoidances when they work inside of it), the patitas have not completely lost their affiliations to their homes inside these areas. But precisely because they retain such affilia tions, the adhik?ras that apply to them, first of all the right to stay in their home, are bracketed by segregation until their sins are expiated. This is because the invisible effect of sins is not a private affair. Although such effects are not shared among individuals, they still affect people's communities. Sins are not transferred from one domain to another, for instance, from one individual to single members of his family, but their very presence within larger domains, like one sinning member within the family or criminals within the state, hinders the ritual integrity (and hence the prosperity) of these larger domains (that is, family and state). Accordingly, it is the family that has to perform the excommu nication ritual (ghatasphota) (see Gautamadharmas?tra 20.2-7; Kane 1968-77, 2: 388) if the sinner refuses to go through the penance, and the king (the lord of the state) has to make sure that such an obstinate sinner is branded on his</page><page sequence="17">Rules of untouchability in law books I 259 forehead as an additional punishment. He is now a permanent outcast, totally excluded from all association with other people (Manusmrti 9.236-39; see also Kane 1968-77,4: 71-72). Speaking in terms of spatial areas, we can therefore make a distinction between patitas who undergo penance outside their villages, still connected to them by a slender bond, and excommunicated, branded patitas who have severed such connections through their obstinacy and are commanded to 'wander over the earth' (Manusmrti 9.238) without location. Vij??nesvara (on Yaj?avalkyasmrti 2.294) applies the same distinction between expiated and unexpiated sin in the case of a twice-born male who has had sexual relations with a C?ndala woman but refuses to undergo the penance. He is not only liable to pay a fine for the crime itself but is further branded with a mark shaped like the female organ. The physical branding is even carried into future births. M?dhava (in his digression on the karmic effects of sin, Par?saram?dhaviya 2, 2: 209-10) quotes some verses attributed to Visnudharmottarapur?na to the effect that sinners who refuse penance and also escape the king's punishment are reborn as animals, and even when they attain human births, they will be marked by bodily defects (see also Kane 1968?77, 4: 153n356). The implication of both the branding and the bodily defects is clear. Sins that are not removed by penance or punished by the king must become physically visible. Unexpiated sins should not be hidden within the ritualized spheres of communal life. Such sins destroy the rituals by which these spheres are preserved (see Manusmrti 7.20-21): they obstruct the cosmic cycle that connects sacrifices, cosmic agents, and prosperity. They do this both by their immediate destruction of the condi tions of sacrifice (the welfare of the Br?hmanas, in particular) and by their invisible effects on the larger domains of which the sinners form a part.15 Whereas the C?ndalas and patitas who undergo penance are related to the village, the mlecchas are defined in relation to the state, but not merely as geographical outsiders. The notion of untouchability is only meaningful inside common domains. There is no point in segregating people as untouchable if they are not part of such domains. Therefore, the untouchability of mlecchas should not simply be seen as a demarcation towards an outside 'other' but as recognition of a shared domain either in the sense of interaction or in terms of a hegemonic appropriation of the world. The land of the Aryans, ?ry?varta, has a privileged place in the world as the land of dharma. This implies 'a unique ritual, religious and soteriological status' among other peoples and other countries (Halbfass 1988: 177). These other peoples of the world are regarded as incomplete or negative exemplars of dharma. The absence of the varna system (Visnusmrti 84.4) and the rituals prescribed by sruti and smrti means that the mlecchas are regarded as subordinate in this world order. They have no place in</page><page sequence="18">260 / Mikael Aktor ?ry?varta, and if they nevertheless reside there, this weakens dharma (Halbfass 1988: 177). Furthermore, we should be aware of the political role of dharma. The fact that ?ry?varta or Bh?rata is 'the land of ritual* (karmabh?mi) (Halbfass 1988: 177) and 'fit for sacrifices' (yaj?iya) (Manusmrti 2.23) also implies that the rituals are the means by which the land becomes part of this noble country. This, according to the view of Medh?tithi (on Manusmrti 2.23), further implies the integration into the caste system of the conquered foreigners, who as a caste will be regarded as the C?ndalas, that is, untouchables. Barbarians beyond conquest, on the other hand, are also beyond the varna system. The implication of these texts is that, ideally, integration would mean subordination in relation to dharma in the sense of accepting the duties assigned to them as untouchable castes and that the ritual and political integrity of the country depends on this. The general pattern that emerges from this exposition is the following: A ritualized agent and a ritualized sphere of agency is one that is conducive to prosperity. Prosperity has different aspects according to each particular sphere: food for the body, fertility for the home, wealth or welfare in relation to village and city communities, common merit in relation to moral norms of action as part of the same community domain, and, similarly but on the larger scale of the state, subjects who are unified by their acceptance of a common social norm (the caste system) and a minimal common code of action. The ritualization of each sphere implies privileging and segregating single elements, and untouchability is the mark of segregation applied to elements that are in reality indispensable or unavoidable within single spheres but charged with inauspicious possibilities. The manner in which I have isolated these factors as separate paradigms of prosperity necessarily results in some oversimplifications. For example, it conceals the extent to which different factors are interrelated across different domains. In fact, the C?ndala is related to all the domains: to the body as a latrine cleaner (although I have never seen this duty, known from later accounts, mentioned explicitly in the Dharmas?stra texts), to the home as a worker on the cremation grounds, to morality when he is explained as the reincarnation of former sinners among the four varnas,{(&gt; and to the country when he is regarded as mlecchas included in the varna system. More than any other category in the complex system of untouchability, the C?ndala therefore represents the total phenomenon. IMPURITY, INAUSPICIOUSNESS, AND UNTOUCHABILITY The vast applicability of the notion of impurity in the Dharmas?stra makes it</page><page sequence="19">Rules of untouchability in law books I 261 difficult to arrive at clear-cut classifications or definitions. Although purity certainly is a major concern in the Dharmas?stra, the pure-impure vocabulary of these texts does not warrant the unequivocal and systematic expression of hierarchy suggested by Dumont but suggests rather a much more complex spectrum of different concerns (Olivelle 1998).17 According to Vijn?nesvara (on Y?jnavalkyasmrti 3.30, p.426), 'impure persons' include menstruating women, dead bodies, C?ndalas, patitas, women in confinement, and persons undergoing ?sauca. These are all the old untouchable categories of Gautamadharmas?tra 14.30 and Manusmrti 5.85 and involve quite different sources of pollution, 'moral' as well as 'natural.' Nevertheless, I shall attempt to outline some general or normative patterns based on well-known systematizations in the texts. The most precise definition of impurity seems to be the opposite of ?uddhi kaumudVs definition of purity quoted above: Purity is the state of 'being fit for performing the rituals that are known from the Vedas' (p.I). This simply spells out what is claimed in this article as the central aspect of purity: Purity is a prerequisite of human ritual agents, a 'felicity condition' of ritual actions. Furthermore, purity is a prerequisite of the constitution and maintenance of personal and common domains insofar as this requires the performance of rituals. Impurity is whatever destroys that adhik?ra. Apart from this basic definition, impurity is classified according to different criteria. One criterion is degree. This was behind Devala's above-mentioned distinction between soil that has become ritually impure (amedhya), soiled (dusta), or dirty (malina) (Par?saram?dhaviya 2, 1: 193-94). The first state is caused by death, birth, the C?ndalas, and human feces or urine. Dogs, pigs, donkeys, and camels cause the second state; and hair, bones, ashes, and the like cause the third. Each kind of impurity requires relatively less purification. Another criterion is the thematic ordering of different kinds of impurity. Kane (1968-77, 2: 651) mentions an ordering attributed to H?rita in different texts. According to this, purity and impurity can be divided in two broad categories: outer and inner (see also Glucklich 1984: 26). The former is further divided into three categories: that which is associated with a person's family (kula), that is, the impurity of death and birth; that which attaches to his belongings (artha), that is, utensils and materials such as clothes, metal, and so on; and that which is derived from his body (sarira) and its impurities, such as blood, semen, feces, urine, fat, and so on. Inner purity is associated with the faculties of this body: the senses, the mind, and the speech. Once again, the structuring principle is the spatial concentricity of a master and his domains, namely, his body and his home with his property and family, the same principle that governs the overall untouchability complex. H?rita's division of outer impurities also refers to different practices. The</page><page sequence="20">262 / Mikael Aktor purity of the body and of material goods comprises the rules of cleanliness (sauca), whereas the purification after birth and death makes up ?sauca. The third aspect of the purity rules, not referred to by this division, is that related to penance (pr?yascitt?), that is, the removal of 'evil' (p?pa), whether that evil is brought on by oneself or not. These three practices, sauca, ?sauca, and pr?yascitt?, cover the entire field of impurity. Although there are no clear demarcations between them, they are each centered on certain prototypical categories. ?auca is related to the impurity of physical matter (mala), ?sauca to death pollution (mrtyu), and pr?yascitt? to transgressions of the injunctions in sruti and smrti (that is, to adharma). All three kinds of impurity affect the integrity of a ritual agent, and all can be removed. The only irremovable impurity is that which attaches to those people, the permanent untouchable, whose "dharma* it is to be permanently available as removers of others' impurity. Once again, the C?ndala by his allotted professions is associated with the whole spectrum of impurity; he is the public 'scavenger' of dirt, death, and crime. Untouchability does not derive from impurity alone but is also triggered by the presence of inauspiciousness. The relation between untouchability and the suspension of the right to perform rituals (karm?nadhik?ra) confirms this notion. While the latter disability is caused merely by impurity, again in accordance with ?uddhikaumudfs definition of purity quoted above, the former is only incurred in states of inauspiciousness. Persons who undergo ?sauca, for example, are not necessarily untouchable during the whole period but only until the bones of the cremated body have been collected. This view is expressed in different fragmented smrtis, for instance, in the SamvartasmrtL Having first given the general rule for the duration of the ?sauca period for the four varnas (ten, twelve, fifteen, and thirty days, respectively), the text points out that untouchability only applies until the bones have been collected. After that, that is on the fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth days, respectively, the relatives are touchable even though the ?sauca period has not yet ended, which means that they stilJ cannot perform rituals or share food with others (Samvartasmrti 36-40b; see also Mit?ksara 3.18, p.408). However, these rules are somewhat controversial and in other texts are regarded as kalivarjyas, rules forbidden in the Kali Age (Par?saram?dhaviya 1, 1: 136; Kane 1968-77, 3: 929-30, 951). To the extent that it has been accepted, this rule introduces a difference that seems to correspond to two different aspects of death. The first part of the ?sauca period is an inauspicious state of physical death and destruction, and during this time the relatives are untouchable. But when that state has ended, when the dead body has reached a state where there is no more decay and death has solely become a matter of overcoming the crisis of the departed spirit, then</page><page sequence="21">Rules of untouchability in law books I 263 the relatives are no longer untouchable (although they are still not fit to perform rituals or to distribute food). When the pr?ta has reached a state where it is capable of feeding on the rice balls offered by the relatives, this crisis and the ?sauca period are over. A rule that is more generally accepted is that which attributes untouchability only to the mother, and not to the father and other relatives, when a child is born (Par?saram?dhaviya 1, 2: 212-13). The birth is an auspicious occasion to the family as a whole, but for the mother, who is the human medium of effects beyond human control, it involves the double crisis of her own and her baby's situation, and therefore, it is only she who is associated with inauspiciousness. Another interesting example is that of the Twe different situations in which a woman might have sexual relation with a C?ndala according to Par?sarasmrti 2.\0.\l-23/Par?saram?dhaviya 2, 1: 343-^7, 353 (see Aktor 1997: 167-74 for translation). If the woman is already pregnant by her husband when she has the affair, she is not required to perform a penance until the child is born, and the child itself is not at all affected. If, on the other hand, she is not already pregnant, she has to undergo an immediate penance. Three situations are mentioned, none of which involves pregnancy. The first is when the intercourse with the C?ndala is interrupted, the second where it is unintentional but fully consummated, and the third where it is both intentional and consummated (these are all standard criteria for decisions regarding penances for women after illegitimate sexual relations). In these three cases she has to undergo increasingly severe penances. Finally, the text mentions a fifth possibility where the woman is not pregnant by her husband but becomes impregnated by the C?ndala. This is the worst situa tion, in which case penance is not adequate at all. She is regarded as irreparably spoiled by the incident and will have to be abandoned by being banished to another country. What differentiates these five situations from one another is the relation between purity as a quality of human agency and auspiciousness as a quality of cosmic or divine agency. In matters of childbirth the wife is an agent that must be pure, but only in the sense that her role is to be the perfect instru ment of the cosmic agency that secures her pregnancy, preferably with a son. In the first of these five situations, auspiciousness has already done its work: the wife is pregnant by her lord. No purification is, therefore, needed in relation to the fruit of what has already been accomplished (the child), but only in relation to the human instrument of future conceptions (the wife after birth). In the final incident inauspiciousness triumphs. The wife is pregnant, but by the wrong man, and an untouchable at that. Hence purification is not possible at all. But in those incidents in between, auspiciousness/inauspiciousness is not yet involved, since there is no conception, and so we find the most elaborate purification rituals. These restore the purity that is needed if she is going to become pregnant again.</page><page sequence="22">264 / Mikael Aktor KARMA AND ADHIK?RA We saw that even in the Dharmasutras (Baudh?yanadharmas?tra 2.2.4.14) it was considered a sin to accept presents from an untouchable such as a C?ndala (see also Mit?ksara 3.289, p.592). The same is the case with uninitiated persons of the three upper varnas (vr?tyas) and outcasts (patitas) (Visnusmrti 57.2-5), as well as with thieves (Derrett 1962: 44). All of these count as unworthy (asat) givers, and those who break the rules and accept their presents will have to perform a penance. But why is this so? Is it because sin or evil qualities are transferred to the receiver by the transaction? If this is the reason, then we should expect that it would be necessary to take the sin or character of the giver into account when determining the penance of the receiver. But this is not the case. None of the texts that deal with this penance indicate anything of the sort (Manusmrti 11.193-94, 194-95; Visnusmrti 54.24; Yaj?avalkyasmrti 3.290). On the contrary, they prescribe a standard penance (living in a cow pen for a month on milk diet and recitation of G?yatri) for any receiver of goods from any unworthy giver. A more reasonable explanation of the prohibition of receiving goods from unworthy people seems to be that worldly transactions form a sphere of activities which constitutes the community of the 'good' (sat), just like the village and the country on a spatial level. Those who are segregated from these spheres should also be excluded from the worldly transactions of good men. It is not a matter of preventing a transfer of evil but of not letting the wicked (asat) into the community of the good. This is why I have chosen to refer to a 'presence of evil' instead of a 'transfer of evil.' The subject is most often discussed in connection with karma. While the 'strict doctrine of Karma would require that there can be no transfer of good or bad karma from one man to another and [that] a man cannot suffer for the sins of others..., modifications of this doctrine were early introduced' (Kane 1968-77, 5: 1595). This is particularly so with respect to the king (Kane 1968-77, 5: 1596). The king acquires a sixth of the merits of his subjects provided he protects them properly (against enemies and by punishing the evildoers), and conversely, he has to take upon himself a sixth of their collected misdeeds if he takes his material share of the country in kind (taxes, for instance) but fails to protect it (Manusmrti 8.304-7). This is because he is the lord of the domain, and as such he is in charge of its ritualization, which in turn is dependent upon the segregation of evil by punishing the evildoers, enforcing penances, and not letting the mlecchas invade the country. If he neglects this segregation while still behaving like the owner of the domain, the evil in his domain will also accrue in him. It is a matter of ownership and responsibility,</page><page sequence="23">Rules of untouchability in law books I 265 not of magic. This is what adhik?ra is concerned with. The adhik?ra of a king implies both that he is the protector of his subjects (nrpa) and that he is their lord (nrpati). In other words, those who fail to segregate what should have been removed or bracketed off from their domains receive the evil that is inherent in these elements. This is tentatively generalized by Vasisthadharmas?tra 19.44 and Manusmrti 8.317: 'A murderer of a learned Br?hmana throws guilt on he who eats his food, an unfaithful wife on her lord, a pupil and a sacrificer on their preceptor, and a thief on the king.'18 It is the responsibility of all noble householders to protect dharma within their own circles and particularly so of masters in relation to their specific domains (such as husbands to their wives or kings to their subjects). Although such relations are in fact sometimes expressed in terms of transfer (see Kane 1968-77, 3: 614), the logic is always that the transfer is from single sinners to those persons who hold the adhik?ra for the domains from which they should have been segregated. Such 'transfers' or this presence of unbracketed evil within adhik?ra domains tend to destroy the rituals by which these domains are maintained and, with those rituals, the conditions of prosperity as well. This notion is supported by the consequences that are depicted in Manusmrti 7.21 if the king fails to punish the wicked: 'The crow would eat the rice cake and the dog would lick the oblation, there would be no ownership for anyone, the lower would be the higher.' This seems to express the paradigm of lordship perfectly: rituals, ownership, and status are three coincident aspects of the adhik?ra of lords, whether in relation to kingdoms or households. An additional comment on the transferability of evil is required. Just as transferability is not a matter of mechanistic magic but of lordship and respon sibility, so too is it not a matter of an alleged inseparability between substance and code or nature and law. As indicated in a review by Ariel Glucklich (1984: 27-32), McKim Marriott's idea of the unity of the 'substance-code' has served as the point of departure for various investigations that have tried to determine 'whether the stuff of karma transfers' (28). If substance and code are insepa rable, then this would seem to explain how in certain transactions (such as those involving food) there is an implicit transfer of the merit or demerit of the giver (and of others who have been in contact with the transferred goods) to the receiver, be it a living person or an ancestor (in the sr?ddha ritual). This would further justify the assertion that karma and pollution are ontologically identical. Glucklich himself rejects this identification, maintaining instead that 'while karma is linked to dharma as law, pollution is an aspect of dharma as nature' (1984: 25). Law and nature, in other words, are separate aspects of one notion? dharma. I find this distinction to be too weak, and following Halbfass' (1988:</page><page sequence="24">266 / Mikael Aktor 314-19) disentanglement of dharma and rta, I would maintain that nature is not an aspect of dharma at all. Rather dharma only applies to human agency, but as such, it interacts (through human actions) with cosmic agency and might even (but only through that interaction) affect 'nature.'19 CONCLUSIONS The material presented in this article suggests that untouchability should not simply be regarded as the last point on a continuum of the pure-impure axis. The exclusivity of untouchability manifests itself in the law books on both the empirical level and on the more implicit level of ritualistic rationale. Empirically it appears that of all the many different avoidances that are involved in the untouchability complex only two are inclusive and valid in relation to larger sections as well. These are the avoidance of sexual relations (agamyatva) and the prohibition against eating the food of those avoided (abhojy?nnatva). All other avoidances?such as the avoidance of touch (asprsyatva), of accepting gifts (apratigrhyatva), of conversation (asambh?syatva), of looking at (adrs yatva), of exchanging food vessels (apap?tratva), of sharing wells, and of social 'mixing' in general, as well as spatial segregation (b?hyatva), the suspension of the right to perform rituals (karm?nadhik?ra), and the command to wear visible marks of untouchability?apply exclusively in relation to persons within the class of untouchable categories, some to all the members of the class (the C?ndalas and menstruating women alike), and some to only certain members of the class.20 This empirical exclusivity can be explained by two factors, both of which are a part of the ritualization of the personal and common domains within which the twice-born male householder operates. One factor is the special relation between untouchability and the central processes of prosperity that govern each domain (nutrition for the body, kinship for the family, and so on). The other factor is the elements intrinsic to each process that are charged with potential inauspicious ness and which are therefore bracketed off or segregated spatially in order to establish a ritual order of things (which in turn secures an auspicious outcome). Untouchability is related to these elements and in particular with menstruation, death, and crime. These distinguishing characteristics become apparent when untouchability is viewed from a holistic perspective as comprising not only the permanently untouchable C?ndala, who is rightly regarded as the prototype of later observed untouchable castes (Dumont 1980: 52), but also the temporarily untouchable</page><page sequence="25">Rules of untouchability in law books I 267 persons among the high-caste members themselves. This holistic strategy may appear to privilege ritual-ideological explanations of untouchability at the expense of socioeconomic considerations (that is, the fact that the untouchables represent an economically exploited group). My intention has been, however, to demonstrate that a radical separation between these two aspects is false. Although the Dharmas?stra is not a very explicit source for the broader socioeconomic aspects of untouchability as a means of preserving a large unskilled labor force, I hope to have shown that even on the ideological ritual level, matters of ownership, wealth, prosperity, and power are essential to the phenomenon. Notes 1. For a critical discussion of the colonial and postcolonial construction of the terminology, see Charsley 19%. 2. For the economic aspects of adhik?ra, the dhan?dhik?ra, see Derrett 1962. 3. The translations of all Sanskrit passages are my own, unless otherwise indicated. The term 'felicity condition' is borrowed from speech-act theory where the validity of single locutions depends on the fulfillment of basic conditions. For instance, the validity of the sentence passed by a judge depends on whether he is, in fact, entitled to hold that position. We also have to under stand the intended goals of rituals in relation to basic conditions of that type of activity?for instance, that the ritual agents are subject to special purity rules. 4. The idea that the performance of rituals is paradigmatic for human agency and not for divine agency, despite the fact that epic mythologies represent gods as both sacrifices and priests, rests on the theory suggested by the Swedish historian of religion, Tord Olsson (1999), that different genres of religious literature produce different representations of the godhead. A comparison of different religious traditions shows that direct accounts of the nature of gods tend to be formulated in vague, non-narrative language with cosmological rather than anthropomorphic reference (as in hymns and direct speech), whereas anthropomorphic accounts of gods (for example, as performers of rituals) are produced only in narrative literature with much smaller ambitions of expressing a 'true' representation. 5. Par?saram?dhaviya is a huge commentary on an earlier text, the Par?sara smrti. Different authors have assigned different dates to the latter text. Derrett (1973: 39), Kane (1968-77, 1: 464), and Lingat (1993: 103) suggest an early date between the first and fifth century CE, while historians Jha (1975: 30-31) and Yadava (1979: 62) think that a date between 600 and 900 CE is more</page><page sequence="26">268 / Mikael Aktor probable. On this difference and its wider implications, see Aktor (1999: 260-67). 6. These verses in Visnusmrti* together with verse 44.9, and K?ty?yanasmrti 433 and 783, both of which are dated by Kane (1968-77, 1: 125, cf. 116; 1: 502) between the fourth and sixth century CE, are also our earliest examples of the use of the word 'untouchable' (asprsya) as a generic term for different untouchable categories. The abstract noun 'untouchability' (asprsyatva) is only used in later digests and commentaries. 7. Dumont (1980: 48) recognized Kane's remarks and showed how the temporary impurity in the family gives rise to permanently impure specialists, such as the washerman, who washes the cloth of menstruating women, and the barber, who is assigned the task of the funeral priest in the south. 8. See Olivelle (1999: xxviii-xxxiv). 9. In contrast to all the other listed avoidances expressed in the Dharmasutras, this one is not explicitly applied to the C?ndalas, but it applies implicitly according to Haradatta's understanding of the term apap?tra (see his commen taries to ?pastambadharmas?tra 1.5.16.30, 1.7.21.17). 10. Devala is one of many eponymous sages whose s?tras or smrtis are lost or preserved only in fragments. Dharmas?stra works, and the medieval commenta ries and digests in particular, typically present their argument by quoting older s?tras, smrtis, and Pur?nas. Some of these are extant smrtis, like Manu and Y?jnavalkya, while many are nonextant, like Devala and H?rita (see Aktor 1999: 264-65; Derrett 1973: 38-39). Although attempts have been made to reconstruct these 'texts' (for instance, the smrtis collected by Hari N?r?yana Apte in Smrt?nam Samuccayah; see Atrismrti), such reconstructions often differ both with regard to the selection of verses and to their order in the text. Verses may also be attributed to extant Pur?nas, although the particular verses may not be found in modern Pur?na editions. 11. A variation of these verses is found in Mit?ksara 3.30 that mentions *a woman in confinement and a midwife' instead of 'both parents undergoing the impurity of childbirth.' This is in agreement with the more common rule that it is only the mother who is untouchable after childbirth, not the father. 12. The temple priest is defined by an anonymous smrti referred to in Mit?ksara 3.30 as a Br?hmana who has received payment for temple service lasting more than three years. This is one example of occupations which render even Br?hmanas untouchable. Hanumanthan (1979: 82, 90), in a South Indian context, cites several legends, all to the effect that Pafaiyas (who were regarded as equal to C?ndalas) also functioned as priests in local cults before the influ ence of North Indian Br?hmanas gradually changed society under the Pallava rulers (seventh-ninth century). He draws the conclusion that at least this section</page><page sequence="27">Rules of untoucliability in law books I 269 of Paraiyas became untouchable (which was not previously the case) as a result of the process by which these Br?hmanas succeeded in supplanting them as temple priests. Even more serious is the case of the equally untouchable Br?hmana funeral priest, the Mah?br?hmana, as described by Parry (1980) on the basis of modern fieldwork and discussed by Quigley (1993: 80-81). According to Quigley, his case shows that the polarity constructed by Dumont between the pure Br?hmana and the impure untouchable is a false representation of the system. 13. This is the standard genealogical explanation for the existence of the C?ndala caste. Similar explanations are given for other low castes (see Manu smrti 10; see also Aktor 1999; Brinkhaus 1978). 14. Inden (1992) develops the notion of 'complex agency' on the basis of the British philosopher of history R. G. Collingwood. Its advantage when compared to the notion of 'consensus' behind Dumont's structural model is that it allows for contextual diversity and antagonism to be present at the same systemic level. 15. This is point eight in Derrett's 'Fundamental theory of Hindu law' (1968: 117-20), the necessity of sanctions by penance and punishment against those who jeopardize the sacrifices that secure rain and prosperity. 16. The list of such sins committed by varna members is long. These are examples: murdering or stealing from a Br?hmana (?pastambadharmas?tra 2.1.2.6; Manusmrti 12.55), sacrificing with what has been obtained by begging from a S?dra (Manusmrti 11.24), sex with a Br?hmana woman or interpreting the Veda if the sinner is a ??dra (Par?sarasmrti 1.1.67), showing contempt for preceptors or seniors (Atrismrti 10; Par?saram?dhaviya 2, 2: 229, 234), any sin which causes defilement (malinikarana) (Visnusmrti 44.9), and drinking alcohol (Y?jnavalkyasmrti 3.207). Likewise, though not in terms of reincarnation, the child who is conceived during the three days of menstruation will be born as a C?ndala (see Leslie 1989: 285). 17. Olivelle's detailed analysis of the Dharmas?stra vocabulary of purity/ impurity is a critique of Dumont's 'theory of caste as based on the gradation of purity' (which is not warranted by the texts) but supports Douglas' more general 'theory of impurity' as a marker of social boundaries and of the body as a social symbol and an instrument of cognitive order (1998: 210). My arguments above about Douglas' ideas in relation to bodily excreta and food transactions are not meant to imply that purity (particularly when involved in social transactions) is not a marker of social boundaries in Dharmas?stra texts. It is so in several ways. I merely want to suggest that when it comes to untouchability, Douglas' theory of the bodily boundaries?both as markers of social boundaries and as cognitive boundaries in classification systems?is insufficient, and we need to look at other factors as well, such as the relation between impurity and</page><page sequence="28">270 / Mikael Aktor inauspiciousness and the concerns for prosperity that are implicit in the latter value. 18. It may look as if the first case, eating the food of a Br?hmana-killer, falls outside the category of responsibility and ownership. But eating the food of others is frequently applied as a metaphor of supremacy and power. Thus, it is the asymmetrical power of the eater and the sinner, like the lord, guru, and king in relation to wives, pupils, and thieves, which is stressed. 19. For the different versions of that interaction in different philosophical traditions, see also Halbfass (1991: 300-328). 20.
