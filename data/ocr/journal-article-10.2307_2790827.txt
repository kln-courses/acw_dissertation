<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS. Rome: Archaeology and Religion. Frazer. 37 Publii Ouidii Nasonis Fastorum libri sex. The Fasti of Ovid, edited with a translation and commentary. By Sir James George Frazer. 5 Vols., pp. xxix + 357, 512, 421,353, 307. 87 plates and 7 maps and plans (all in Vol. V). Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd., London. 6 guineas. Five new volumes, albeit the last one is composed ,entirely of a characteristic Frazerian index and a host of plates, is an extraordinary achievement from a veteran scholar. At least, we should think it so if we were not so used to Sir James Frazer's prodigious capacity for work, which seems neither to lessen nor to lose freshness and enthusiasm. The general plan of this book is roughly the same as that of his long classical Pausanias, with one exception: he has added a text of his own editing, originally meant, it would seem, for the Loeb series..In thus sacrificing to the jealous gods of philology and criticism he must be admitted non litare a few times--I have noted some technical slips in a forthcoming review in the Journal of Roman Studies. The reader who is rather anthro- pologist than Latinist, and for such the work is primarily intended, need trouble himself but little about them; for once that he is misled regarding a trifle, he will be safely guided a hundred times into no common paths of knowledge. Ovid, following in large measure Alexandrian precedent, set out to versify the civil and ecclesiastical calendar of Rome (to use modern terminology) from January to December, in twelve books, whereof he completed but six. He was no antiquarian, but had read up the subject in good authors, chiefly, so far as we can judge, the great scholar of his day, Verrius Flaccus. His ignorance of astronomy was without beginning or end, and therefore in the many notices he gives of the rising and setting of stars and other such matters, he is as often wildly wrong as approximately right. His style, on the other hand, although artificial, is neat, pretty, and, apart from some poetical conventions of the day, very clear. It follows that not much is needed in the way of ordinary explanatory notes on grammar and the like, especially when a good translation is provided; and therefore the learned editor does well, from the point of view of the classical hardly less than the anthropological reader, in confining his remarks almost entirely to correction, ampli- fication, and, most important of all, illustration of the many pieces of curious lore which Ovid has preserved for us. It need hardly be said that if there exists on earth a parallel to one of the many customs of which Ovid speaks, it is likelier to be found in these copious, yet unpedantic and even chatty, notes than anywhere else in the avail- able literature of the subject. Taking at random instances from a single volume, the fourth, we find on p. 74 that Sir James sets out to supplement Ovid's somewhat imperfect account of the Argei and his, or rather his authorities', unscientific guesses of what it all meant, by a veritable monograph extending to p. 113. He asserts (rejecting Mannhardt's theory) that the ceremony was either, as [ 51 ]</page><page sequence="2">No. 37.] MAN. [March, 1930. Plutarch says it was, a purification, the figures called Argei being embodiments of demons or other such unchancy bearers of ill luck, or else, as maintained by himself as long ago as 1885, that the whole ceremony is a sacrifice to the river, offended by the impious erection of a bridge. I may state in passing that I now accept this view as the most likely, think the former one quite possible, and have abandoned the theory of Mannhardt which I once held, that the Argei are vegetation-spirits in puppet form. Now follows a long series of notes on archawological, astronomical, historic and mythological matters. They are good, but not peculiarly good; other competent scholars could have given the information as accurately, though few so lucidly and agreeably. But on p. 142, the editor finds another chance for his characteristic learning, and we have an excellent note on the whitethorn which, according to Ovid, was used to avert the vampire-like creatures called striges. On p. 144, another brief but admirable series of parallels illustrates the well-known prohibition on looking backwards when engaged in ritual. And so it goes on, every opportunity being seized to heap up information of the most interesting and carefully collected sort. But this is merely to say that the book is a typical piece of Frazer's work. It is interesting to note what attitude the editor takes up on those points concerning which he has long held views of a decided nature, by no means universally received. As regards the numerous stories, such as that of Romulus and Remus, in which an Italian god appears in fully human form, becoming the father of children by a divine or a human consort, he still finds genuine mythology, not Greek- derived invention. Here the reviewer must disagree. It is, of course, perfectly true that stories of this kind have a wide distribution; that the gods of many lands beget offspring, and that individuals and families claiming descent from them are, or at any rate were, no rarity in very many parts of the world. The facts that the story, for instance, of Tyro is found in Greece, and that of Rea Silvia in Italy; that in both legends the human mother has a divine father for her twin offspring, that the children are exposed at birth, rescued by the agency partly of beasts and partly of men, and finally grow up to be kings and right the wrongs their mother has suffered-all this in itself is not enough to prove that the Italians had borrowed from the Greeks, for every detail can be found among peoples whose connection with Greece is non-existent. It is, in the abstract, perfectly possible that such a tale was told in early Rome, whether by reason of parallel development of ideas common to a great part of mankind or as the result of borrowing from an ancient fund of legend belonging to the inhabitants of the Mediterranean lands in prehistoric times. The question is simply, whether any Italian, uninfluenced by foreign myths, thought of one of his own native gods as sufficiently anthropomorphic, not simply to cause a woman to conceive, for that, apparently, was the function of at least one minor deity- Mutunus Tutunus or Mutinus Titinus-but to become in his own person her lover and the literal and physical father of her offspring. We have abundant evidence that Greek gods were so thought of; their cult-statues, the repeated assertion that they were supposed to have human form, a vast number of myths showing no trace whatsoever of any foreign influence, all point that way. But for Italy, apart from Greek cult-practices, Greek statues, and theories plainly derived from Greek sources by such writers as Cicero, I know of no real evidence that the native gods were so conceived. Rather do we gather from what we know of them that each was, as a rule, simply a personified function or small group of functions, and that no other ideas attached to them. Indeed, they appear scarcely to have been worshipped or thought of save on those occasions, generally fixed in the calendar or marked by some note- worthy event, on which it was held that their functions were called for. Therefore the anthropomorphic Italian god remains an assumption, rather contradicted than sup- ported by our admittedly scanty evidence; and it seems bad method to make such an assumption rather than allege what is confessed on all hands to be a uera causa, namely, borrowing by the Italians in comparatively late times of the products of Greek imagination ready-made. I stress the point, not because it is of much importance whether a Greek or an Italian first imagined that a pair of semi-divine twins founded Rome, but because, if the story and a hundred others like it are imported as regards their main themes, it ,follows that not much can be drawn from them in the way of evidence concerning early custom and belief in the peninsula. That divine kings are still to be found in a work which must of necessity explain what Ovid says about the Rex Nemorensis is, perhaps, not astonishing, though their dis- coverer's belief in them as Italian phenomena seems to have grown rather more robust since the last volume of the Golden Bough appeared. That mysterious figure remains a great puzzle; for if he really is a divine king of the familiar type, the lack of any real evidence for more of his kind anywhere else in the neighbourhood is strange (I for one cannot take seriously the attempts made to find traces of such an idea among the shadowy phantoms of the Roman kings); whereas, if he is not of this sort, it is none too easy to explain his functions and origin at all, though, in my opinion, not impossible. More interesting, perhaps, is the fact that so great an authority on totemism leaves it an open question whether there may not have existed totemistic practices in Italy, survivals of which are to be found in such things as the relation of wolves to the Hirpini. The passage in which the matter is discussed (Vol. III, p. 11) is, by the way, a model of well-informed and temperate reasoning. The above hints at the contents, which leave on one side the masses of information con- cerning topography, history, and secular antiquities of all sorts, may serve to indicate the nature and value of the work, but to appreciate it properly, careful study of the whole is necessary, and to recommend this is to invite readers to a pleasure, not a dull duty.
