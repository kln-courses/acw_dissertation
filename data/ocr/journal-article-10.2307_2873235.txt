<plain_text><page sequence="1">BLAKE AND MADNESS: THE WORLD TURNED INSIDE OUT BY ANDREW M. COOPER Historical Designing is one thing &amp; Portrait Painting another &amp; they are as Distinct as any two Arts can be[.] Happy would that Man be who could unite them. Blake, letter to Butts of September 11, 1801 Blake's warning notwithstanding, the present essay seeks to trace a picture-puzzle able to unite, or at least yoke by violence together, a single lineament of the biographical subject with its correspond- ing design in social history. I take my cue from W. J. T. Mitchell's observation a few years ago that "Blake occupies an often ambig- uous borderline between the divine madness of inspiration, and the demonic madness of incapacity and false or fruitless labor, a mad- ness of irrationality, slavery, and compulsive repetition." Urging a return to the old question of Blake's madness despite its ostensible vulgarity, Mitchell points out that "the formalist aesthetic ... finds the method in his madness, and calls it sanity. But what if we began to see the method as the madness?" He goes on to caution that "interesting" results may follow only if we "deepen and particu- larize our historical sense of madness and Blake's place in it."'" Yet the relative paucity of hard data about Blake's life-as opposed to his disciples' many anecdotes about his visionary puncturings of the bourgeoisie-makes it hard to steer a course between the Scylla of mythological recuperation and the Charybdis of psychoanalytical reduction. One solution to this impasse is massive reconstruction of Blake's various milieux, leading to inferences, really educated guesses, as to what he likely felt about event x, person y, or private crisis z. This is the labor of ages David Erdman undertook so suc- cessfully in Blake: Prophet Against Empire (1954), which paves the way for any sociohistorical treatment of Blake. Somewhat lacking from the book, however, is the subjective dimension of both the poetry, which Erdman tends to flatten into journalistic reportage, and of the poet, whose experiences become atomized amid a welter of contingent events. In this sense, Erdman's Prophet is perhaps still haunted by the positivism of the intellectual-historical ap- ELH 57 (1990) 585-642 ? 1990 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 585</page><page sequence="2">proach he was trying to surmount-hence the book's revised sec- ond and third editions, while adding valuable new information, generally retract, rather than extend, his interpretive claims. In predicating a dualism between the sovereign individual and the external world in which he strives to realize himself, traditional intellectual history retains its periodization and narrative line largely by overlooking or rationalizing evidence of the disintegra- tion or restructuring of individuality. From a methodological stand- point, the value of studying madness is that it is par excellence the area where private and public histories intermix, the duality be- tween the autonomous individual and the object-world being merely the provisional outcome of such mixing, albeit one fre- quently reified for the sake of critical control. Indeed, Blake, more than any other Romantic except Shelley, deliberately redefines the subjective individual of traditional political and epistemological discourse. At the same time, Blake's project unmistakably reflects his private paranoid tendencies to experience the social-political upheavals of his time as personal crises, and, conversely, to project his personal crises outward as grandiose cosmic ones. Yet Blake grew increasingly aware of these tendencies. Thus, we must dis- tinguish between his compensatory conflation of the personal with the public, and his self-conscious exploitation of this tendency in order to dramatize the interrelationship-sometimes constraining, sometimes liberating-between the two realms. This is where the attempt to readmit subjectivity into historical analysis is useful. Having survived deconstruction, the "subject" is back, but it is no longer the pre-existent subject of traditional meta- physical discourse. As David Simpson said recently, "Subjectivity can now be thought of as ... made up of both idiosyncracy and intersubjectivity. The first is particular to an individual, and in- cludes not only will and choice but also a genetically unique con- stitution of the sort that we have hardly begun to understand but must nevertheless recognize.... Intersubjectivity describes what is not peculiar to an individual-the general determinations at work within subjective behavior."2 Similarly, Blake's "As the Eye-Such the Object"3 is not a form of epistemological quietism implying that the apocalypse arrives once we behold the infinite in everything. Rather, the phrase bespeaks his more actively political awareness that the world we know is nothing but a complex construct of rep- resentations projected mostly, but not entirely, by other people. Claims A Vision of the Last Judgment, "Error is Created[;] Truth is 586 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="3">Eternal[.] Error or Creation will be Burned Up &amp; then &amp; not till then Truth or Eternity will appear" (E 565; italics mine). Blake's pervasive anthropomorphism whereby a mythological figure (say, Urizen) is simultaneously identified with a state of mind (detached introspection), a particular bodily part which engenders that state (the reifying eye), the environment which that part appropriates (the wasteland of Ulro), and specific historical figures inhabiting that environment (William Pitt, Napoleon, the soldier Schofield who had Blake tried for treason in 1803), conceives identity as an interlocking of self and surroundings. Personal experiences be- come depicted as cultural events, and vice versa. Consider, for example, Blake's redrafting in "London" of "ger- man forged links" to "mind-forg'd manacles" (E 796). Generally praised for universalizing a phrase too awkwardly particular in its reference to the despotism of the Hanoverian King George III, the revision in fact extends the specificity of that reference by implying that a prime source of George's oppressiveness was his recent bout of madness and its contagious ability to "mark" with paranoia lib- eral opponents such as the poem's speaker. At the same time, this example also shows that Blake, like other Romantics, is constantly tempted to reduce the social to the psychological. He repeatedly asserts the imagination's absolute power to create what it per- ceives; anything less extreme, such as the Wordsworthian position that we only half-create what we perceive, seems to him complicit with Lockean materialism. By regarding the self as a microcosm, he internalizes his surroundings and thereby gains control over his experiences of them. Too much internalization, however, and the external threats can seem uncannily to control the self from within. Increasingly, Blake recognizes that the sense of autonomy resulting from internalization may come at the price of passively absorbing cultural repression. In Milton and Jerusalem, therefore, he begins to develop a politicized epistemology that offers him, as we shall see, both more engagement with worldly affairs and better protec- tion from them. I A brief excursion into object-relations psychoanalysis can clarify the basic intersubjectivity of Blake's mythology. My procedure here is less anachronistic than it seems. The method of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century psychiatry was taxonomic rather than reflexive; for Blake, its chief deficiency was, accordingly, its in- Andrew M. Cooper 587</page><page sequence="4">ability to perceive the inventedness of its representations and its own investment in them. Blake sees that although the psychiatric nosologies of his day strive toward comprehensiveness and univer- sality, the very rapidity of their growth, reflected in the prolifera- tion of increasingly detailed stereotypes and categories, belies their claims of totalization. Recognizing this contradiction, he tries to exploit the new stereotypes for dynamic, relational ends. Indeed, the reason his mythology has proven so susceptible to allegorical interpretation, whether biographical, historical, psychological, or cosmological, is that its precise content matters less than its essen- tially relational nature. The objects involved are internal objects- representations-but inasmuch as they represent not only the world and others in it but self-images as well as the self's intro- jected images of how it (thinks it) is viewed by otherst, these objects are embedded in social life. Particularly useful here is Melanie Klein's much-debated con- cept of "projective identification." Many British Kleinians follow Wilfred Bion in insisting that projective identification is a concrete process whereby unwanted feelings are emptied "into" an object (the mother as "container"), which is then controlled through ma- nipulation of those feelings. Other object-relations theorists main- tain that projection is always "onto," and that the apparent con- creteness of the process is, precisely, a fantasy. Certainly it is hard to see how any actual transfer of psychic contents could occur ex- cept by magic; in a psychoanalytic version of the Romantic ide- ology, some Kleinians appear to have mistaken their metaphors for truth, uncritically embracing their patients' fantasies of thought om- nipotence. By contrast, Adam Smith, whose influential Theory of Moral Sentiments (1760) explains that it is through the mechanism of "sympathy" that we are able to share another's feelings, fully accepts the epistemological limitations of Lockean empiricism: we only think we feel what the other does, we can never know for sure, and indeed when we sympathize with another's physical suffering we know we do not feel it as the other does because we only feel it as if it were physical. Otto Kernberg offers an unusually precise account of the steps involved in projective identification. He defines it as "a primitive defense mechanism consisting of a) projecting intolerable aspects of intrapsychic experience onto an object, b) maintaining empathy with what is projected, c) attempting to control the object as a con- tinuation of the defensive efforts against intolerable intrapsychic 588 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="5">experience, and d) unconsciously inducing in the object what is projected in the actual interaction with the object."4 Kernberg's analysis helps to explain the process in The Book of Urizen whereby Los, having created Urizen, becomes what he beholds. Indeed, their relationship resembles that of doctor and patient- Los is the specialist appointed to save Urizen from eternal death- much as Los's overthrow epitomizes the adage, "Physician, heal thyselfl" The newly made Urizen projects onto Los his sense of isolation, a misery too excruciating for Urizen to acknowledge it as his own. Los senses Urizen's projection and through "pity"- Blake's term for the vicarious distancing implicit in Smith's dis- tinctly theatrical concept of sympathy,5 which in Blake's view pro- duces not genuine empathy but hypocrisy and masochism-he identifies with Urizen's projected fallenness; after all, to perform his labors Los, too, has had to withdraw from Eternity. Thus Urizen gains control over Los, most obviously when Los grows jealous of his son, Orc, and plans to sacrifice him "Beneath Urizens deathful shadow" (U 20:25; E 80). And yet Urizen is in a sense Los's pro- jection: "Los wept howling ... / ... for in anguish, Urizen was rent from his side" (6:2-4; E 73-74). What Urizen does to Los, Los as an Eternal does to himself, for Urizen's separation results as much from the Eternals' efforts to protect themselves from Urizen by relegating him to Los and building a defensive wall (19:2-9; E 78), as it does from Urizen's act of withdrawal. At issue here is a ques- tion about origins: what causes Urizen's fall? The double perspec- tive by which Blake waives the question is shared by current ob- ject-relations theorists: from a modern psychoanalytic perspective, the origin of intra- psychic functioning is to be seen as a diadic situation.... It is "interpersonal"' in that there is no drive without object relation- ships, nor object relations without drive. All of these separations are artificial.... The [allegedly] purely intrapsychic defenses are advanced defenses. Omnipotent control, idealization, de- valuation, projective identification, splitting, denial ... all have implied interpersonal functions.... So what looks like a "one- person system" is actually a highly sophisticated, advanced situation. (Kernberg 122) What Los projects and then internalizes through identification, in other words, is not an object but a relation, not Urizen but Los's own representation of Urizen.6 The diadic nature of Urizen's relation to Eternity is recapitulated in his diadic relation to his own universe. Urizen is seen to be Andrew M. Cooper 589</page><page sequence="6">simultaneously an individual occupying what Klein calls "the para- noid-schizoid position," and the psychotically fragmented, perse- cutory world which that individual constructs for himself: "his world teemd vast enormities / Frightening; faithless; fawning / Portions of life; similitudes / Of a foot, or a hand, or a head / Or a heart, or an eye, they swam mischevous / Dread terrors! delighting in blood" (23:2-7; E 81). But whereas earlier Urizen gloated Sa- tanically over his avowed autonomy, he now "sickens" to see these things (23:8, 23)-in Kleinian terms, he advances to the "depressive position." For, as the Urizenic Los views Urizen, thus does Urizen view himself. Urizen's chaotic world does not simply reflect the mechanisms of ego splitting and the projection of unwanted por- tions of self; since the projected objects are internal representa- tions, Urizen's world also includes his introjection of Los's horri- fying view of him. What arouses Urizen to explore his dens and invent Newtonian tools for measuring them is the voice of Orc, Los's son. Urizen thus internalizes Los's creativity, albeit in a char- acteristically tyrannical fashion, just as Los earlier internalized Urizen's repressiveness by binding Orc. Blake portrays their inter- relationship verbally by letting the despondent self-withdrawal de- scribed in verses 2 and 3 of chapter 5 (13:28-34; E 77) refer to either character (similarly, the description of Urizen in 13:13-14 is ap- plied almost verbatim to Los at 13:36-37), and visually by distrib- uting between them what, as I hope to show, were the standard iconographical elements of madness. In Blake's illustrations (fig- ures 1 and 2), Urizen gets the leg-fetters and the sitting position with drawn-up knees, while Los the beholder, whose crouch an- ticipates his collapse into Urizen's position, gets the folded, side- hugging arms suggestive of "A tight'ning girdle ... Around his bosom" (20:9-10; E 80)-that is, a straitacket.7 Los's fashioning of the formless Urizen in defense of the Eternals and the dialectics of their ensuing relationship can be seen to dra- matize how the madman is in part a socially constructed alter ego against which a culture defines itself. Observes Sander L. Gilman, all portrayals of madness are also representations of our fear of self-disintegration projected outwards and reassuringly localized.8 As a form of chaos existing within culture, mental illness threatens the bounding line between self and other, and internally between our (pre-Oedipal) definitions of "good," as that which we can con- trol, and "bad" as that which we can't. These definitions, Gilman points out, supply the basis for cultural stereotyping. But if the 590 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="7">B: 0 X,* X ,.

From an object-relations perspec- tive, the child splits his identity into a "good" self capable of con- 592 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="9">trolling the external world, and a "bad," anxious self which he repudiates and attempts to project onto the "bad" world. In this way, the child avoids having to confront the basically contradictory nature of the self, its simultaneous inclusion of "good" and "bad" aspects. Nevertheless, precisely because self-purity is illusory, it needs to be reinforced by stereotyping-that is, Gilman explains, through primitive bipolar representations of the world that reflect the idea of an absolute division between self and other. For Blake, such opposites are Negations. In reality, he sees, opposites are interdependent: "Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to Human existence" (MHH 3; E 34). Moreover, since Negations "spring from" Contraries, contrary vi- sion apprehends the social constructedness of all opposites, their historical contingency as "what the religious call Good &amp; Evil." In Louis Althusser's terms, such internalized representations are ide- ology, which portrays "not the system of the real relations which govern the existence of individuals, but the imaginary relation of those individuals to the real relations in which they live."9 In Blake's lifetime, the main center of ideological contention was of course the French Revolution, which served at times to expose, at other times to confound the real and imaginary relations of Brit- ish individuals to "the system." The shock with which England received news of French developments was partly a shock of rec- ognition, since English Tories and Jacobins alike tended to assimi- late those developments to their own sphere of events, dominated by the recent madness of King George III. From November 1788 to April (officially March) 1789, George, too, had lost his head, albeit temporarily, and it was natural to view the constitutional issues of the ensuing Regency crisis as foreshadowing those surrounding the meeting of the French Third Estate. At this preconscious level, prolepsis and retrospection combine to discover patterns invisible to rational thought. For example, to a liberal Whig struggling against the heightened censorship of the 1790s and uncertain whether George's recovery was really complete (some newspapers rumored otherwise), the anonymous 1735 "Account of the Progress of an Epidemical Madness" would have looked like a fair descrip- tion of current affairs, beginning as it does by telling what happens "when a Grandee or Minister of State is seized" with lunacy: "He neglects or despises all real Dangers, terrifying himself with vain Apprehensions of Things that can never come to pass, such as an invasion of England "with a resolution to destroy the establish'd Andrew M. Cooper 593</page><page sequence="10">Religion. . . ." And if you fail to rejoice at the absurd countermea- sures taken, then "incontinently you are a Rogue, a Traytor, a Jaco- bite, a Papist, a sturdy Beggar, or a Friend and Abetter of the Quak- ers. Such is their inconsistence in the violence of their Paroxysms."'10 Particularly striking is the volatility the Revolution introduced into the match-up between stereotype and self- image-that is, between people's internalized representation of the world and their picture of their own role within it. In a society threatened with bouleversement, the bouleversiers, too, felt the need of self-definition, even if they could only obtain it through identification with a negative stereotype. Thus in the early 1790s Painites gleefully embraced Burke's famous denigration of them as "the swinish multitude" because, as Olivia Smith argues, "the phrase proclaimed a unity of thought and consciousness" that im- plicitly refuted the social fragmentation conveyed by the reaction- aries. "The insult that embodied their social status as inadequate thinkers became the chosen mode for disproving the accusation by engaging in the act of writing." Not surprisingly, in the long run this ironic adoption of enemy rhetoric marginalized the radicals and reinforced the social hierarchy. Pace E. P. Thompson, journals like Pig's Meat and Hog's Wash were unable, says Smith, "to develop a politically conscious audience or to recommend a political strategy. The social gulf between pigs and swineherds leaves no alternatives other than outbreak or obedience. "11 Other developments show more complexly how the patriotic ste- reotype, John Bull, gradually acquired through projection aspects of the British "bad self," which then became introjected as a form of self-criticism. This inversion is reflected in the curious aboutface that Theresa M. Kelley discerns in political cartoons of the period.'2 Early caricatures of Napoleon tend to depict him as an empire- building colossus opposed by a small John Bull who is merely trying to defend England. After 1805, however, as resistance to the Continental blockade succeeds, Napoleon grows increasingly thin (as in James Gillray's portrayals of "Little Boney") and John Bull increasingly plump. Kelley points out that from a Tory perspective, this reversal reflects English pride in their country's economic well-being and the conviction that the French cannot survive with- out English trade. Particularly after Napoleon's defeat and exile in 1815, however, John Bull begins to appear disgustingly swollen and obese. With the foreign threat eliminated, Napoleon's original hugeness is transferred to John Bull as an implicitly liberal criti- 594 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="11">cism of the contrast between the Prince Regent's greedy luxury and the hunger and deprivation in England. Thus the initial opposition between England and France reemerges as an opposition within English society itself.13 Partly, such an inversion arises from the very nature of satire, which tends to undermine all stereotypes whatsoever. Observes Ronald Paulson, "In consistently applied caricature there are no 'heroes'. . . . it is quite possible to render a negative image so con- sistent and so exaggerated that it may be taken as ridicule of the mind that conceived it (the mind that sees all else as Other), turning the caricaturist into his own protagonist."'14 For Paulson, this atti- tude is epitomized by Gillray, whose work aims "to elide difference rather than set up oppositions.... He sees the time of revolution not as an oedipal struggle but as a process of regressional transfor- mations in the direction of undifferentiation with all kings the same, kings and subjects equally alike cannibals or tyrants" (200). But if the increasing polarization of British politics during the Na- poleonic period turned Whig and Tory into an amoral parody of each other, the perception of this truth is only possible through the caricaturist's ability to imagine each side from the other's view- point, thus adopting each side's negative stereotype. While this perception places the caricaturist himself at the center of his work, it also undermines any notion of a center and deprives the carica- turist of autonomy, since "as an artist he spins all his conceits from the delusions of others (even his own)" (211). It is tempting to explain Gillray's own madness on these grounds. For his uncon- tainable satire obliterates the distinction between Them and Us necessary to the Hogarthian freak-show depiction of lunacy. When Hogarth nails a shilling to the wall of Bedlam to show that Britannia shares the Rake's folly (figure 3), he is merely gesturing toward the familiar Augustan conceit that all the world is mad; the sanity of the conceit itself, or of the artist or spectator who entertains it, is never seriously in question. By contrast, in Gillray's grotesque-and in its closest literary equivalent, Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell- the artist/author and viewer/reader cannot escape the bewildering immediacy of the work. The ironic indeterminacy of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell-its fragmented form, contradictory assertions, and the difficulty of distinguishing the author's prophetic voice from "The voice of the Devil"-attests a collapse of the prevailing moral opposites based on Blake's Gillrayan recognition of their degraded sameness as Negations. Instead of merely standing what Andrew M. Cooper 595</page><page sequence="12">Figure 3. William Hogarth, "The Rake's Progress" (1735/63), p1. 8. Courtesy of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin. the religious call good and evil on its head, The Marriage aims to provoke a catachretic perception of contrariety itself, an "infinite" annihilation of the boundary between the world and our internal representations of it, an annihilation that necessarily defies all de- piction or explanation (these being merely the bound or outward circumference where reasoning and stereotyping begin).15 The ironizing power of the all-encompassing grotesque becomes apparent when one comes to a work like John Haslam's Illustra- tions of Madness, Exhibiting a Singular Case of Insanity, and a no less Remarkable Difference in Medical Opinion: Developing the Nature of Assailment, and the Manner of Working Events; with a Description of the Tortures Experienced by Bomb-Bursting, Lob- ster-Cracking, and Lengthening the Brain (1810). The latter five terms of the title refer to the paranoid delusions of one James Mat- thews, patient at Bethiem Hospital. The difference of medical opin- ion concerns on one hand the improbably Dickensian doctors Birk- beck and Clutterbuck, who had judged Matthews to be of sound 596 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="13">mind and had moved habeas corpus for him on behalf of his family, and on the other hand the staff at Bethlem who wanted to keep Matthews confined. Haslam's method is to begin by quoting the testimonials of Birkbeck and Clutterbuck, and then to refute them by telling Matthews's byzantine story of conspiracy, betrayal, and hospitalization in the patient's own words, ostensibly compiled from his papers and personal interviews. Matthews was a tea mer- chant who, distressed by the outbreak of war between Britain and France in 1793, travelled to Paris and used his connections to begin negotiating peace with the French. His plans collapsed when the Jacobins seized power and jailed him. Released in 1796, he re- turned to England convinced that he alone could save the country from a French plot to undermine its government and military by teams of "magnetic spies" -mesmerists-strategically positioned "near the Houses of Parliament, Admiralty, Treasury, etc." 16 Using "airlooms" to transmit "magnetic impregnation," the French con- trolled the thoughts of British politicians and indeed the entire Cabinet-William Pitt was particularly vulnerable-rendering them mere "puppets," "automotons" (68). Worse, the French knew Matthews was on to them, and so had sent a team to torture him mesmerically by "foot-curving, lethargy-making, spark-exploding, knee-nailing, burning out, eye-screwing, sight-screwing, roof- stringing, vital-tearing, fibre-ripping etc.' (38). Needless to say, Matthews's committal in 1797 only clinched his suspicions that the government had in fact been infiltrated (7). My point is not to emphasize the political aspect of Matthews's paranoia, although it is striking that almost half of the patients de- scribed at any length in the anonymous Sketches of Bedlam (1823) had either committed political crimes (including three attempted assassinations and the mutinous beheading of a naval captain a la mode Franqaise), or else saw themselves as political prisoners forced to wear "the chains of slavery"' in "this Bastile, in Albion."'7 Quite the contrary, Haslam is careful to present Matthews's delu- sions entirely from the subject's own viewpoint, without commen- tary, even providing a detailed fold-out illustration of how "Cairlooms" work (45). One might suppose the author was sympa- thetically reimagining Matthews's paranoia so as to immerse the reader in its painful psychological reality. After all, Joseph Mason Cox, William and Samuel Tuke, Philippe Pinel and other "'moral managers" were at this time advocating the use of "pious frauds" and "deceptions" whereby the doctor pretended to adopt the pa- Andrew M. Cooper 597</page><page sequence="14">tient's delusion in order to disprove it to him, a strategy frequently requiring elaborate staging and the assistance of a group of role- players (often patients themselves)."8 Yet this would be a drastic misreading. Haslam, the chief apothecary at Bedlam and therefore Monro's main ally against Matthews's petition for release, was strongly opposed to moral management; his book's epigraph from Foote reads, "Oh! Sir, there are, in this town, Mountebanks for the mind as well as the body." Haslam's authorial stance is dryly ironi- cal in the conservative Augustan sense: since Matthews's absurdity speaks for itself, simple description ought to reveal the necessity of his confinement. As the reader will, he assumes, neVer question the line separating sanity from madness, sympathetic identification with the madman is impossible. An attentive depiction of Mat- thews's delusions will therefore heighten, rather than diminish, the distance between him and us. It never occurs to Haslam that his tale of Matthews's delusions might possess a compelling subjec- tivity of its own. It is similarly hard to determine if a print like Richard Newton's "A Visit to Bedlam" (1794; figure 4) really belongs, as Gilman claims, "in the eighteenth-century tradition of the asylum as a re- flection of the world and its passions."19 The bug-eyed terror of the visitor at right, mirrored in the eyes of the lunatic with whom he is virtually nose-to-nose; the look of violent surprise by the man ac- cused of cuckoldry (why has he dropped his walking stick unless the accusation has somehow startled his secret fears?), and the ve- hemence of his wife at far left, who overlooks the lunacy of the accuser and argues with him as an equal (does she protest too much?)-all these elements can be taken to support the topos of universal folly. Yet the composition of the print less resembles the neoclassical perspective box where, as in Hogarth, the spectator is safely distanced from a tableau of distinctly theatrical mad types, than it does Gillray's skewed perspective in which "objects and actions seem to be flowing off the picture space" (Paulson 208). The way the floor of the room drops off at the bottom implicates the viewer in the perturbed voyeurism of the visitors. Likewise, the meeting of the walls at center suggests it is the visitors who are confined to a room while the madmen stand on the outside looking in. The tightlipped mouths of the two madmen indicate a self- restraint and stoic forbearance in marked contrast with the visitors' vulgar gaping. However traditional Newton's intentions may be, in context of Blake's and Gillray's all-encompassing grotesque his 598 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="15">Figure 4. Richard Newton, "A Visit to Bedlam" (1794). Yale Medical Historical Library, New Haven, Connecticut. Dialogue: "You are a cuckold." "You lie, you mad dog. I am as honest a woman as any Parson's wife in London!" print, like Haslam's Illustrations of Madness, assumes a bizarre, expressivist immediacy. The Augustan conceit that all the world is mad, and yet a line can be drawn distinguishing connoisseurs able to savor this conceit from the "real" madmen, begins to look com- placent and hypocritical. Indeed, John Conolly, writing in 1830 to consolidate earlier psy- chiatric reforms into an organized "moral management" movement, suggests that Matthews developed his elaborate conspiracy theo- ries "chiefly before those who sought to have them fully detailed; and that he enjoyed that perverse pleasure of exaggerating which has been mentioned among the infirmities of mind."20 Thus Conolly, whose position is that "all the terrible revelations of the madhouse, do but exhibit the more intense and permanent exist- Andrewv M. Cooper 599</page><page sequence="16">ence of emotions and of errors which have, at some time or other, predominated in the observer himself' (14), implies not only that we can become the Hogarthian fool we behold, but that we actually aid and abet his foolery in order to sharpen the always worrisomely blurry line between ourselves and the mad other. As a matter of fact, Conolly is surely correct. Until 1770, visitors to Bedlam had virtually a free run of the hospital for the entrance-fee of a penny; witness the two ladies in the background of Hogarth's print, one of them oh-so modestly averting her face at the sight of an inmate pissing; from 1770 until the 1815 Commons Committee instituted major reforms, a system of ticketing permitted extensive sight- seeing in the manner Newton's print depicts. As a popular pam- phlet put it, "the English people have sometimes been charged with enjoying a kind of unnatural pleasure in gazing upon maniacs of every description."' It is hard to imagine that an audience so prurient would not have encouraged Bedlamites to stage their in- sanity in exchange for money, food, or simple attention. Indeed, Haslam complained that "to constitute madness, the minds of ig- norant people expect a display of continued violence, and they are not satisfied that a person can be pronounced in that state, without they see him exhibit the pranks of a baboon, or hear him roar and bellow like a beast."22 Thus the most successful performances gave the audience what it wanted by gratifying its expectations, however inaccurate, of conventionally crazy behavior. Whether or not such mad-shows were carried out in mockery of the audience, as Roy Porter claims, they suggest that the madman, not unlike the Painite of the early 1790s, could secure a social role only by collaborating with the very stereotypes that served to justify his confinement.23 II Blake's first direct involvement with the dynamics of cultural stereotyping came through Johann Caspar Lavater's Essays on Physiognomy, the magisterial English edition of which (1789-98) was supervised by their mutual friend Henry Fuseli. Blake, who had read with approval Lavater's Aphorisms on Man (1788), pro- duced four engravings for the first volume. As his detractors saw, Lavater's new "science" was a fairly straightforward affirmation of mind over matter, specifically of the mind's ability to mold facial features and even the bones of the head in conformance with par- ticular characterological traits. In Lavater's words, "Physiognomy would accordingly be, the Science of discovering the relation be- 600 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="17">tween the exterior and the interior-between the visible surface and the invisible spirit which it covers-between the animated, perceptible matter, and the imperceptible principle which im- presses this character of life upon it-between the apparent effect, and the concealed cause which produces it."24 For Blake, who be- lieved throughout his life that "every Natural Effect has a Spiritual Cause, and Not / A Natural: for a Natural Cause only seems, it is a Delusion" (M 26 [28]:44 45; E 124), the appeal of Lavater's doc- trine was immediate. Asserting "the universality of physiognomical sensation" rather in the manner that Shaftesbury posited the exist- ence of a sixth, "moral" sense, Lavater examines a vast assortment of heads, skulls, faces, silhouettes, and full-length figures-most dead and famous, many alive and infamous, a few imaginary, some geniuses, some idiots-and describes the nmoral character of each. He does this ostensibly by inference based on physiognomic prin- ciples, but in practice by reading backwards into the face whatever he already knows about its wearer. Blake recognizes as much when he comments, "There is a strong objection to Lavater's principles (as I understand them) &amp; that is He makes every thing originate in its accident"; yet "accident is the omission of act in self &amp; the hindering of act in another, This is Vice," and "as I understand Vice it is a Negative" (E 600-01). Lavater's tacit mistaking of natural effects for spiritual causes enabled his successors, Franz Joseph Gall and Johann Caspar Spurzheim, to reverse the relation of skull shape to mental character; in their even more popular science of phrenology, the first determines the second. Lavater avoids these materialist implications by emphasizing the physiognomist's need of "tact," "generosity," a "quick, penetrat- ing, and just eye," "strong and lively imagination" and a "soul firm, yet gentle, innocent and calm" (1:119-20, 126). Such empathic abilities are intended to solve a problem of representation at the heart of his work. Says Lavater toward the end of the book, "I have already expressed my distrust in the resemblance of engraved por- traits; and I believe I have likewise said, that I consider images of illustrious men, in general, nearly as so many caricatures" (3B:435). Indeed, the young Goethe, a collaborator in the project, com- plained to Lavater "how difficult it is to bring the dead etching to life, where character only glimmers through misunderstood lines, where one is in doubt about what has meaning and what doesn't. How different is life!"25 Or as Blake would remark some thirty years later, "What is it that distinguishes honesty from knavery, but Andrew M. Cooper 601</page><page sequence="18">the hard and wirey line of rectitude and certainty in the actions and intentions. Leave out this line and you leave out life itself; all is chaos again. . ." (E 550). As with any other book of its day, the faces in the Essays were produced in two ways. Either they were en- graved second- or third-hand after details in paintings by artists as stylistically diverse as Michaelangelo, Holbein, and Romney, paintings usually available only through some previous engraving; or they were engraved after commissioned, so-called "original" de- signs, themselves often derived or copied from earlier pictures.26 The only escape from such distorting mediations would be for the author to undertake the herculean task of designing and illustrating as well as writing his book: Blake's task. Mediation does not thereby cease, but it ceases to be insignificant and distracting, since it is no longer incidental to the author's purposes. Meantime, Lavater is continually driven to comment as much upon the style and spirit with which a face is engraved, or upon the character of the engraver himself, as upon the face's actual owner. Consider his remarks on Fuseli's picture of Satan (figure 5): What an extraordinary production! It proves at least beyond con- tradiction the extraordinary powers of the Artist; it announces a man filled with his subject, pressing toward the mark, and mak- ing every effort to attain it; prompt in seizing an idea, and eager to bring it forward. You feel at once what must have passed in his mind at the moment when he gave himself up to this composi- tion; but the smallest reflection is sufficient to the calm Observer to discover its faults: he finds in it a borrowed and affected man- ner: that original sin of all Painters who have genius, or who imagine that they have it. (2B:285) The conflation of Fuseli's perspicuity, ambition, and determination with those of Satan is attributed to Fuseli "when he gave himself up to this composition." But Lavater, too, is guilty of conflation when, criticizing the portrait in several respects, he attacks Fuseli's trans- gressive mannerism as the "original sin" of genius: "The Mannerist is apparent in the mouth. In this copy [Grignion's engraving] it is weak, though it be not so in the Original [Fuseli's design]: here it expresses fear rather than contempt. The under lip is far too good. The chin too ought to have been better characterised: compared with that terrible forehead, it is too gentle and attractive; it should have been broader, firmer, a little awry, and projecting." The de- fensive note below the picture declaring that "the Engraver has consulted the Designer, and followed the Original, the mouth of 602 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="19">* { ; ~ii.. :. *~~~~ . :: .... . .. . . _ s Jo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.......

Cooper 603</page><page sequence="20">contempt to Fuseli looks like fear to Lavater. Caught in the middle of this dispute, the engraver Grignion is just trying to do his job. Lavater's method of analysis by projection generates a near- endless process of interpretation and revision, as the book's con- tinuous accretion of new illustrations and commentary, both within the original edition and in subsequent ones, goes to show. At times the ubiquity of physiognomical truth, and hence its unverifiability, distresses the author. For if the science of physiognomy is in fact universal, its truth must be acknowledged even by those who reject it. Lavater is thus led to identify with his detractors even while portraying himself as their saintly victim: The rage of the vicious, therefore, against Physiognomy, is to me the most convincing proof, that, in their heart, they believe it. They discern the truth of it in others, and tremble to think of becoming a proof of its reality in their turn.... Ye zealous An- tagonists of Physiognomy . . . [i]n the silence of your closet, I shall sometimes obtain from you a smile of approbation, and the next moment-you will affect to laugh at the truth which you have felt.-You will henceforth make more frequent observa- tions, you will thereby be enabled to proceed with a firmer pace; but you will not be less inclined to turn all these observations into ridicule; for it is the philosophic ton [sic] of the age in which we live, for men to make merry with those truths which they inwardly believe, and from which they cannot withhold their assent. (1:40-41) The circular logic of the opening sentence, and Lavater's frustrated sense of a conspiracy against him which the same circular logic prevents him from proving, rings paranoid. Yet such logic is also self-aggrandizing. Compare the passage with the conclusion of the "Account of the Progress of an Epidemical Madness": There is one Circumstance which is common to all sorts of Mad- ness, insomuch that it seems to be its Characteristick.... This is a violent and unaccountable Aversion which the Patients take to their Physician. Therefore if any Persons should be observ'd to rail against and abuse the Author of these Sheets, let them be immediately seiz'd and confin'd; for depend upon it they are infected with one kind or another of those Madnesses I have been treating of: Otherwise they have no just cause of Complaint against me. (70) The witty self-deflation here is of a piece with Haslam's irony. Clearly, the author does not feel threatened by the rejection he anticipates, any more than the reader feels trapped in the author's 604 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="21">Catch-22. If Lavater's dismay before basically the same paradox seems more immediately personal, his vulnerability nevertheless affords him a solution unavailable to the earlier writer: by grandi- osely embracing the antagonists in his audience, he can claim that they do not so much threaten as confirm his authority. The problematics of representation form the explicit subject of the influential Essays on the Anatomy of Expression (1806), written as well as illustrated by Charles Bell, a physiologist whose research focused on the anatomy of the nervous system. Blake's friends, John Flaxman and Fuseli, both received gift copies of the book, which a designer-engraver like Blake would have known, anyway. Bell was neither a monistic idealist like Lavater nor a Humean sensational- ist. Even as he describes "the extensive influence of the corporeal on the intellectual part of man," he rejects the claim that "the af- fections which we call passions or emotions" can be reduced to their accompanying sensations, and the latter then "arrayed as proofs that the affections exist in the body." Rather, "[the affections] are conditions of the mind, and cannot be seated in the body, although they both influence and are influenced by it."27 He thus arrives by an empirical path at the surprisingly physiognomi- cal-sounding conclusion that "the man was wrong who found fault with nature for not placing a window before the heart, in order to render visible human thoughts and intentions. There is, in truth, provision made in the countenance and outward bearing for such discoveries" (86-87). Asserting that "anatomy, in its relation to the arts of design, is, in truth, the grammar of that language," Bell posits an iconography of the human body much as Lavater posits one of the face: "The expressions, attitudes, and movements of the human figure are the characters of this language, adapted to convey the effect of historical narration, as well as to shew the working of human passion, and to give the most striking and lively indications of intellectual power and energy" (2). But whereas Lavater regards human character as a determinate moral essence revealed by fixed, iconic depictions of faces, Bell is interested in the workings of passion as expressed by full-length sketches of figures in action: "Till [the artist] has acquired a poet's eye for nature, and can seize with intuitive quickness the appearances of passion, and all the effects produced upon the body by the operations of the mind, he has not raised himself above the mechanism of his art, nor does he rank with the poet or historian" (3). Exploring various formulas for producing an ideal head by drawing the lips, say, at a certain angle Andrew M. Cooper 605</page><page sequence="22">to the forehead-formulas with which Lavater dabbles, and which Philippe Pinel also uses in measuring the relative skull sizes of maniacs to idiots, and of both to the proportions of the Apollo Belvedere-Bell decides that "with all this there is much want- ing-that which measurement or a mere line will not shew us" (30). Here, as Gilman says, "the transferal of radical objectivity from the measurable (i.e., Pinel's measurement of relative skull size) to the impressionable (i.e., the analysis of the expression of the mentally ill) has been completed" (D&amp;R 30). Blake's art, hieratic, iconic, rigidly outlined, obviously has much more in common with Lavater's aesthetics than with Bell's. But despite its impressionism, Bell's depiction of insanity reflects the same stereotyping as Blake's. Bell's "Madness" (1806), Fuseli's "Cain" (from Lavater's Essays, 1792), J. E. D. Esquirol's "Dementia" (1830),28 the anonymous early nineteenth-century lithograph entitled "The Mad House" all show that Urizen's char- acteristic posture-sitting, with knees drawn up and arms folded around them or hanging limply at the sides, "In chains of the mind locked up" (U 10:25; E 75)-was a conventional image of madness at the turn of the century (figures 6-9). This stereotype reflects a paradox. As "the mad-business" became medically respectable dur- ing the later 1700s, madhouse doctors and keepers began to take a second look at their charges, generating a new psychiatric empiri- cism. Earlier portrayals of madness, often based on the Shakespear- ean asylum featuring Hamlet, Ophelia, Lear, and the Macbeths, yielded their literariness to individualized descriptions drawn from actual madhouses. But since these descriptions went hand in hand with the proliferation of psychiatric definitions and categories, they rapidly assumed the form of the case study. And because certain cases served the existing nosologies better than others, they be- came "classical" or "textbook" examples; when nosologies changed, interpretation of these cases became pivotal, regardless whether the interpreter had ever actually seen the patient. Thus the theorization of madness as mental illness produced a formalism all its own. James Matthews, for example, acquired a distinct textual- ity. Initially allowed to condemn himself out of his own mouth in Haslam's Illustrations of Madness, then externalized via his walk- on role in the freak parade of Sketches of Bedlam, Matthews is finally adduced as an exemplification of psychiatric theory by Conolly, who uses Haslam's book to argue in rebuttal that Mat- 606 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="23">Figure 6.

III Urizen illustrates a type of madness that increasingly dominated eighteenth-century psychiatry, a curable madness differing from both idiocy, deemed to result from organic brain damage, and de- mentia or permanent loss of reason. That madness had remissions and "lucid intervals" had been acknowledged at least since the Renaissance. On this basis, Locke made a distinction between mad- ness and unreason that crops up in virtually every eighteenth- century discussion of the subject: Andrew M. Cooper 607</page><page sequence="24">Figure 7. Henry Fuseli, "Cain,"from Lavater's Essays on Physiognomy, vol. 2B, p. 286. Courtesy of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin. Madmen ... do not appear to me to have lost the faculty of reasoning, but having joined together some ideas very wrongly, they mistake them for truths; and they err as men do that argue right from wrong principles. For, by the violence of their imagi- nations, having taken their fancies for realities, they make right deductions from them.... In short, herein seems to lie the dif- ference between idiots and madmen: that madmen put wrong ideas together, and so make wrong propositions, but argue and reason right from them; but idiots make very few or no proposi- tions, and reason scarce at all.29 It thus became possible to view madmen as reasoning from a false premise vivified and reinforced by association of ideas. Locke's position led through Pinel's central concept of "manie sans delire" -what Spurzheim called "reasoning foolishness"-to what the first comprehensive Dictionary of Psychological Medicine 608 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="25">Figure 8. "Dementia," from the Atlas to Jean Etietme Dominique Esquirol's Des maladies mentales (Paris: Balliere, 1838), p1. 24. (1892) termed "insanity of doubt," characterized by "metaphysical unrest, the individual being always perfectly conscious of his state," and "mental self cross-examination-the outcome of doubt- and dread of contact with external objects": apparently a psychiat- ric version of the "philosophical melancholy and delirium" that Hume's skeptical extension of Lockean metaphysics induced in Andrew M.. Cooper 609</page><page sequence="26">Iti Figure 9. Anon., "The Mad House," early nineteenth century. Yale Medical Histor- ical Library, New Haven, Connecticut. him.30 Late eighteenth-century medical books therefore begin to distinguish a peculiarly subtle patient whose illness lies in a faulty assumption about reality-a delusion-but whose reasoning pow- ers remain intact or even heightened, inasmuch as they are enlisted to invent ingenious rationalizations of whatever might expose the delusion. Writes Spurzheim, "Many insane persons, if we grant their premises, reason with perfect consistency; nay, in many, that power is increased" (51). Michel Foucault has attempted to clarify the ontological basis of such madness. Observing that "madness is ultimately nothing" in- asmuch as it joins "vision and blindness," "order and disorder," he argues that madness can manifest itself only by departing from itself, by assuming an appearance in the order of reason and thus becoming the con- trary of itself.... Meaningless disorder as madness is, it reveals, when we examine it, only ordered classifications, rigorous mech- 610 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="27">anisms in soul and body, language articulated according to a visible logic. All that madness can say of itself is merely reason, though it is itself the negation of reason. In short, a rational hold over madness is always possible and necessary, to the very de- gree that madness is non-reason. This seems confused-significantly so. On one hand, Foucault claims reasoning madness is not one among many types, it is the paradoxical form that madness necessarily assumes whenever it is forced to manifest itself or disclose its (non)meaning. On the other hand, the nature of madness is such that "it reveals, when we ex- amine it, only ordered classifications," one of which is reasoning madness, which thus emerges as a specific type of madness con- structed at a particular time in response to the developing logic of the new psychiatry.3' Foucault's confusion ccrresponds'to a dispute in the historical conceptualization of reasoning madness. In his well-known attack on James Monro, William Battie importantly modified the Lockean position, defining madness as "deluded imagination," "madness, or false perception, being then a praeter- natural state or disorder of Sensation."32 In other words, contrary to Locke, sensation itself, the very basis for association of ideas, could be disordered. Monro fils replied bluntly that "madness is a dis- temper of such a nature, that very little of real use can be said concerning it; the immediate causes will for ever disappoint our search, and the care of that disorder depends on management [by which Monro meant traditional confinement] as much as medicine."33 He thereby defended his family against Battie's charge that they were mere "empiricks" interested in running Bethlem as a sinecure rather than contributing to science by teach- ing or publication. But Monro's fatalism indiscriminately lumped all madmen into Battie's category of "original madness," ignoring his other category of "consequential madness," which according to Battie was curable because it possessed, qua delusion, a subjective, psychologically coherent reality of its own.34 Obviously, Blake's epistemology more resembles Battie's than Monro's. For Blake, "if Perceptive Organs close: their Objects seem to close also" (J 30 [34]:56; E 177), so that "what seems to Be: Is: those to whom / It seems to Be, &amp; is productive of the most dreadful / Consequences ... : even of / Torments, Despair, Eternal Death .. ." (J 32 [36]:51-54; E 179). Urizen, then, is a reasoning madman who suffers the torments of Battiean "false perception." His "conglobed" shape (U 12:5; E 76) illustrates the circular logic Andrew M. Cooper 611</page><page sequence="28">whereby he seems the absolute ruler over the narrow space, Earth, that has been created to uphold and contain him in his eternal death. As Blake explains in Milton, "the nature of [such] a ... space is this: it shrinks the Organs / Of life till they become Finite &amp; Itself seems Infinite" (10 [11]:6-7; E 104). Urizen's "self-closd, all- repelling" (U 3:3; E 70) posture suggests that if initially he is "a fathomless void" (6:5; E 74), nevertheless that void possesses a distinct interiority, "a deep world within" (4:15; E 72). His abstract emptiness is really a form of concealment: "Urizen ... / His prolific delight obscurd more &amp; more / in dark secresy hiding ... / ... his phantasies" (10: 11-14; E 75). It is not surprising, therefore, that Blake complicates the standard iconography of madness by portraying figures of cunning in similar sitting positions. Compare Urizen (figure 1) and the madmen (fig- ures 6-9) with Blake's emblem sketches of "cruelty" and "mischief," and the hiding assassin in the Preludium of Europe (figures 10-12). Blake wants to emphasize the interrelationship be- tween perverted calculation and Urizenic madness: the cunning are secretly mad, and madness, so far from being unreason, is ex- cessive rationalism. His figures of deceit are modelled on James Gillray's caricature of Edmund Burke not only because Burke had absurdly flourished a dagger in a Jacobin-baiting speech in Parlia- ment in December 1792, as David Erdman points out,35 but be- cause Burke's rhetorical excesses during the February 1789 debates on the Regency Bill had led many observers to believe "that he appeared to have lost his own reason in describing the malady which preyed upon that of the King."36 Burke lectured the House on lunacy, explaining he had taken great pains to make himself master of the subject; he had turned over every book upon it, and had visited those dreadful mansions where those unfortunate beings are con- fined.... Mr Burke read an extract from the volume to which he alluded, which stated, that some of these unfortunate individuals after a supposed recovery, had committed parricides, others had butchered their sons, others had done violence to themselves by hanging, shooting, drowning, throwing themselves out of a win- dow, and by a variety of other ways. [When Mr. Burke read the extract, there was a cry of Oh, Oh! and sir Richard Hill called, Order!]37 Earlier he had claimed that the laughter which frequently inter- rupted his speeches during this time "was worse than madness 612 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="29">Andrew M.

As Pope said, in words Hunt made the motto of the Examiner, "Party is the madness of many for the gain of a few." Indeed, Blake views Parliament itself as a lunatic asylum. The wrestler who ap- pears in Europe strangling two opponents, and whom Erdman identifies as either Pitt, Pitt's right-hand man Dundas, or Burke, conforms to the stereotype of violent "raving" madness.38 His shaved head and posture recall the final stage of Hogarth's Rake's progress, the Rake's confinement in Bedlam, as well as the appar- ent model for this picture, the statue of manacled "raving madness" which, together with its passive counterpart, "melancholy," graced the entrance to Bethlem (see figures 3 and 13). The figure escaping in the upper right-hand corner, his hands clutching his head- probably Fox or one of his followers-dramatizes the turn- of-the-century expression, "Keep your hair on!"39 It appears the Whigs are struggling to remain sane, while the Tories have lost their wigs. In Tiriel, composed in 1789, Blake presents a prototype of Urizen largely based on the insanity of George III that year. Erdman points out a number of parallels (Prophet 131-38) which I will summarize while adding a few of my own. Like George, "Tiriel is a king" (4:37; E 280) and is possessed by "madness &amp; deep dismay" (3:31, 26; E 279); like George, he loves his daughters but hates and is hated by his sons; abandoned, aged, blind as well as mad, Tiriel clearly views himself as a Lear figure (George had contrived to read a copy of Lear over his keeper's objections, and on returning to Windsor Castle after a levee complained, "I return to you a poor old man, weak in body and mind");40 Tiriel also claims repeatedly to be "King of the west" (2:19, 8:4; E 278, E 284), much as George in his madness occasionally believed he still ruled over his American colonies. Finally, Tiriel's protean transformations in his struggle with Ijim can be seen to reflect George's violent mood swings and general self-disintegration. Ijim's remark that "like a river he would seek to drown me in his waves" (4:53; E 281), and Mnetha's closing lament that "now my paradise is falln &amp; a drear sandy plain" (8:26; E 285), recall Burke's comment that "the disorder with which the sovereign was afflicted was . . . like a vast sea which rolled in, and at a low tide rolled back, and left a bold and barren shore" (PH 27:1247). Erdman notes that Blake's "diagnosis of Tiriel's bad up- 616 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="33">-M. 4 ~td . 4JX tit Wn " ' k tijj ft ,_ t ft&amp;&gt;l -|zu~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i i*ZS fv Uf T&gt;! 4rr+, --! f~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~a ...

Their therapy called for the doctor to induce an ostensibly tranquil- lizing fear and awe in the patient, preferably through charisma and force of will, otherwise the straitjacket.43 Especially important was the doctor's look, the power of his gaze. Francis Willis drove this point home strikingly. The physicians-in-ordinary called to evalu- ate George's madness in late 1788 bickered along suspiciously po- litical lines: Sir Richard Warren, a Whig, insinuated that the King's insanity was irreversible-which if true would make a Regent of the Whiggish Prince of Wales-while the Tory doctors clung to the somatic view that George's derangement was merely a symptom of his fever.44 Throughout December and January the royal physi- cians' conflicting diagnoses were hotly debated in Parliament and were duly reported in the papers together with scandalous accounts of the king's behavior. A Privy Council committee was formed to investigate and, over much protest, Willis was given charge. He soon shocked everybody by his severity in employing the strait- jacket as both a punishment and an inducement to royal submis- siveness; then he shocked them again by his leniency in allowing the King to shave with a straight-edge razor, a decision for which Burke took him to task, asking what Willis would have done "if the Royal patient had become outrageous at the moment." Willis re- sponded by giving Burke a dose of the King's medicine: "'Place the candles between us, Mr. Burke,' replied the Doctor, in an equally authoritative tone-'and I'll give you an answer. There Sir! by the EYE! I should have looked at him thus, Sir-thus!' Burke instantaneously averted his head, and, making no reply, evidently acknowledged this basiliskan authority."45 William Pargeter treated his patients using the same dramatic technique: The maniac was locked in a room, raving and exceedingly tur- bulent. I took two men with me, and learning that he had no offensive weapons, I planted them at the door, with directions to be silent, and to keep out of sight, unless I should want their 618 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="35">assistance. I then suddenly unlocked the door-rushed into the room and caught his eye in an instant. The business was then done-he became peaceable in a moment-trembled with fear, and was as governable as it was possible for a furious madman to be.46 By contrast with mesmerism, whose physicalist principles a French commission of eminent scientists had discredited in 1784, prompt- ing many to view Mesmer as a charlatan,47 the moral managers used eye-contact to establish their authority on the assumption that this was the first step in recalling the patient to a normative awareness of moral and social values. Willis and his followers Pargeter, Cox, and William Perfect particularly emphasized the salutary sense of fear the eye could elicit. Although the therapy practiced at William Tuke's famous York Retreat reflected a liberal humanitariansim ut- terly foreign to Willis, Tuke's effort to instill "self-restraint" like- wise depended upon the power of the eye, as Foucault points out (251). Blake's repudiation of these methods is evident in the way The Book of Urizen undermines what Haslam disparagingly called "this fascinating power which the mad doctor is said to possess over the wayward lunatic" (Observations 275). As we have seen, Los be- comes the horror he beholds. "Mad doctor" indeed: Haslam im- plies that the new psychiatrists are themselves insane because they arrogate more-than-human powers. At the opposite end of the po- litical spectrum, Blake similarly questions whence Los, Urizen's moral manager, derives his authority, and how he can exert it with- out entering into a necessarily compromising relationship with his charge. In the poem, Los's appointment comes from Eternity. But since Eternity's nature is to be self-unified, the loss of Urizen in- evitably impairs it. When the remaining Eternals confusedly de- cide to wall themselves off from Urizen (19:2-9; E 78), they confirm that they are estranged not only from him but from their own true selves. IV Blake's ambivalence toward Los as Urizen's caretaker can be seen to reflect his society's mounting, Rousseauvian recognition that man's secret inner irrationality differs from publicly seques- tered unreason only in respect of its greater visibility. In his biog- raphy of the poet Cowper, William Hayley, Blake's one-time patron who had involved him in the project, explains that in confronting Andrew M. Cooper 619</page><page sequence="36">"the misfortune of mental derangement ... I consider it as the duty of a Biographer rather to sink, in tender silence, than to proclaim, with circumstantial, and offensive temerity, the minute particulars of a calamity, to which all human beings are exposed. .. 48 Simi- larly, John Conolly repudiates physicians who "have sought for, and imagined, a strong and definable boundary between sanity and insanity," arguing that "no man can confidently reckon the continu- ance of his perfect reason" (295, 8). In surveying all these varieties of weakness in the human intel- lect, with all the aggravations of which they become capable, from slight impairment to hopeless disease, every man, I imag- ine, may recognise in a more permanent form some of the tran- sient imperfections of his own nature. The extravagant indul- gence and dominion of hope, of fear, of anger, of despair, and all the terrible revelations of the madhouse, do but exhibit the more intense and permanent existence of emotions and of errors which have at some time or other predominated in the observer himself. . (164). Conolly seems well aware that Battie's purportedly humane defi- nition of madness as deluded imagination could be dangerously extended to encompass any behavior deemed deviant. Ironically, he therefore stakes a position closer to the conservative Lockean- ism of Monro, who claimed "it is certain the imagination may be deluded where there is not the least suspicion of madness, as by drunkenness, or by hypochondriacal and hysterical affections; there may be real madness where the imagination is not affected; so that a deluded imagination is not in my opinion the true criterion of madness" (3-4).49 Conolly's Introduction paints a pathetic pic- ture of a fundamentally sane man "torn from his family, from his home, from his innocent but eccentric pursuits, and condemned, for an indeterminate period, to pass his days among the idiotic and the mad" (8_9).50 In 1792, William Pargeter likewise warned that "not- withstanding the recent regulations, there are many private mad- houses in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, which demand a very serious enquiry. . . . A very strict eye should be kept on these gaolers of the mind; for if they do not find a patient mad, their oppressive tyranny soon makes him so . .." (129-30). Yet Conolly's humanitarianism, like Hayley's, only leads him to consolidate the work ethic and the inequalities of the status quo. If "many individuals who conduct themselves rationally in the soci- ety in which they are restrained by the habits of social life ... 620 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="37">would, if freed from these restraints, become guilty of many extrav- agances and eccentricities," then it follows that "the rich and pow- erful become eccentric from indulging desires which those who are not rich or powerful cannot indulge: they do what others only wish to do." Conversely, "the advantage of being unable to follow the mere bent of inclination is, that it often protects men from absurd and criminal gratifications, and compels them to seek gratification by exertion and by obtaining the favour of society" (169-70). Since wealth corrupts, one is fortunate to be without it. We might have expected the opposite argument that the poor, unable to indulge eccentricities which Conolly admits are an inescapable part of hu- man nature, are driven to express them in anti-social ways. But this line of thought runs counter to the basic logic of moral manage- ment, which was that if unshackling madmen enabled them to shoulder responsibility for their own cure, the reason was that they were already somehow responsible for their illness. The moral managers' conviction that madness could be cured, not merely ac- commodated, reflected their belief that patients could recover their social identity through what the Tukes called "self-esteem" and "self-restraint" -qualities not unrelated to the work ethic of laissez- faire capitalism. Since the new bourgeois society claimed to be self-legitimating, it was compelled to see itself as the author of its own ills (poverty, unfreedom, social unrest, etc.). According to Klaus Doerner, middle- and upper-class illnesses such as hysteria and melancholy were regarded as non-ideopathic and curable pre- cisely because they could then function as society's means of un- derstanding its inner contradictions. Chief among the latter was the contradictory nature of the entrepreneurial spirit, which was the source of wealth and comfort, yet harbored dangerously intense passions and demanded a freedom of action bordering on wildness.51 (In contrast, the so-called "pauper lunatics" and "sturdy beggars" were considered largely impervious to cold and hunger and, by the same token, unresponsive to all but the most primitive forms of care.)52 Indeed, in Blake's lifetime madness was increasingly seen as a socioeconomic phenomenon. The French view that England's high rates of madness and suicide attested its decadence was assimilated to the nation's positive self-image. In The English Malady (1733), Dr. George Cheyne argued that the greater incidence of mental illness in England was chiefly due to "the Richness and Heaviness of our Food, the Wealth and Abundance of the Inhabitants (from Andrew M. Cooper 621</page><page sequence="38">their universal Trade), the Inactivity and Sedentary Occupations of the better Sort (among whom this Evil mostly rages) and the Hu- mour of living in great, populous and consequently unhealthy Towns. . . ."53 The widespread concern toward the end of the cen- tury that insanity was growing as a result of England's advances in civilization partly reflected an extension of the Lockean paradigm of individual mental growth as leading from direct and vivid sense- impressions of the external world to more refined, self-conscious, potentially effete "ideas" about those impressions. But such con- cern also looks like a conservative attempt at socioeconomic self- diagnosis: more insanity is simply the price of greater material com- fort and the heightened sensibility or "nervousness" that goes with it. As Foucault observes, Spurzheim reinforces this link between madness and the dangerous "sentiment of self-esteem and independency" encouraged by the British spirit of competitiveness (213-14). Concurring with Benjamin Rush that "there is but little insanity in those countries where the government is despotic," Spurzheim claims insanity is "most frequent" in England owing to the too constant and too powerful excitement of the mind and feel- ings, which the strife for wealth, office, political distinction, and party success produces in this free country.... Moreover, En- gland is a mercantile nation; the mind is continually occupied with speculations, wavers between fear and hope, since the suc- cess depends on so many chances. Selfishness, the soul of com- merce, easily becomes jealous, envious ... (235-36, 125). Although Blake would hardly have supported Spurzheim's implicit attack on liberal free-thinking during the post-Napoleonic restora- tion of the monarchies, he most likely agreed with these criticisms. For Blake, the emergent middle class supplies the ideology of rea- soning madness, and Locke supplies its epistemology. Blake's satire on Lockean metaphysics is well-known and needs no rehearsal. Suffice it to say that Los's Pyrrhic victory over chaos by closing Urizen's, and ultimately his own, doors of perception until "All the myriads of Eternity: / All the wisdom &amp; joy of life: / Roll like a sea around him, / Except what his little orbs / Of sight by degrees unfold" (U 13:28-32; E 77), is a parody of Locke's claim that "whensoever we would proceed beyond these simple ideas we have from sensation and reflection, and dive further into the nature of things, we fall presently into darkness and obscurity, perplexed- ness and difficulties, and can discover nothing further but our own 622 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="39">blindness and ignorance" (1:418).54 Blake's critique of Locke dove- tails with his critique of entrepreneurialism (much as Locke's meta- physics support his theory of social contract). The process whereby Urizen denies self-conflict by separating a putatively unified inner "I" from an external world that he believes he must defend against and master, a process which the poem shows to result in the crea- tion of fallen existence, explains the conventional duality between subject and object as a culturally embedded form of paranoia. It is precisely Urizen's refusal to recognize his role in constructing this alienated order of reality, his persistent denial of any personal in- vestment in his narratives of self-aggrandizing struggle within that order, that constitutes for Blake the fundamentally delusional con- dition of the eighteenth-century "possessive individualist."55 Uri- zen's self-enclosed realm points to the self-legitimating nature of bourgeois society, its ability to co-opt and exploit threats to its sta- bility. Accordingly, Blake's alleged madness proves, by a familiar irony of which the poet was well aware, to be his society's glib rejoinder to his own cultural critique. Alluding to the Examiner's review of his 1809 exhibition as the work of "an unfortunate lunatic" that gives "fresh proof of the alarming increase of the ef- fects of insanity,"56 Blake replies in his Public Address, "It is very true what you have said ... I am Mad or Else you are so [.] both of us cannot be in our right senses Posterity will judge by our Works." He then gives the reason for this charge of madness: "Commerce Cannot endure Individual Merit its insatiable Maw must be fed by What all can do equally well..." (E 573). Blake's accompanying attacks on Correggio, Rubens and Titian likewise reflect his view of the Renaissance apprentice system as exploitative and entrepre- neurial, even capitalistic: The story that is told in all Lives of the Painters about Correggio being poor and but badly paid for his Pictures, is altogether false; he was a petty Prince, in Italy, and employed numerous Jour- neymen in manufacturing (as Rubens and Titian did) the Pic- tures that go under his name. The manual labour in these Pic- tures of Correggio is immense, and was paid for originally at the immense prices that those who keep manufactories of art always charge to their employers, while they themselves pay their jour- neymen little enough. (E 548) Blake explains that he himself has been a journeyman compelled, through lack of public interest in his own work, to copy other men s: "This has hitherto been his lot-to get patronage for others Andrew M. Cooper 623</page><page sequence="40">and then to be left and neglected, and his work, which gained that patronage, cried down as eccentricity and madness" (537-38). As Cheyne goes on to show, the sociology of mental illness origi- nated in the traditional humoralist view of the effects of climate on national temperament. Nevertheless, an influential Whiggish the- ory of the relation of politics to madness was developed by Ben- jamin Rush, physician, revolutionary, millennialist. For Rush, "there is an indissoluble union between moral, political, and physical good"; "human life exists in the greatest quality, and for the longest time, in a republican state," and is nowhere "in a more perfect state than in the inhabitants of Great Britain, and the United States of America," the reason being that "these countries enjoy the additional stimulus of freedom."57 Rush's "Account of the Influ- ence of the Military and Political Events of the American Revolu- tion upon the Human Body" similarly demonstrates the necessity of democratic political convictions for personal and social health. Among the patriots, hysterical women were cured, unfruitful mar- riages prospered, and high morale helped people to surmount the wages of war. Loyalists, on the other hand, suffered the so-called "protection fever," a hypochondriacal concern for the safety of their persons and property caused by their loss of power and deteriorat- ing social status.58 Not that the sociological view of insanity was necessarily liberal. Tories called Jacobins "modern madmen," and spoke of the French Revolution as "this cursed influenza," "La Maladie Jacobine" whose "virulence and contagion . . . is as destructive to the consti- tution of the body politic, as that of the former is to the human body."59 In a passage that anticipates the French Terror, Rush ac- knowledges that with the peace between America and Britain in 1783 "the excess of the passion for liberty, inflamed by the success- ful issue of the war, produced, in many people ... a species of insanity, which I shall take the liberty of distinguishing by the name of Anarchia" (277; presumably, the liberty.Rush takes in naming and categorizing this excessive passion for liberty homeo- pathically restores moderation). Similarly, with the revolutionary period beginning to fall into perspective, George Burrows writes in 1828: "Insanity bears always a striking relation to public events. Great political or civil revolutions in states are always productive of great enthusiasms in the people, and correspondent vicissitudes in their moral condition; and as all extremes in society are exciting causes, it will occur, that in proportion as the feelings are acted 624 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="41">upon, so will insanity be more or less frequent." But though Bur- rows accepts the implicitly conservative notion that civilization tends to promote madness, he does so in order to make the reformist point that "many of the causes inducing intellectual derangement, and which are called moral, have their origin not in individual passions or feelings but in the state of society at large."60 As Blake puts it, probably thinking of George III: "A Tyrant is the Worst disease &amp; the Cause of all others" (E 625). v The sociological approach to mental illness underlies Blake's later doctrine of intersubjective "States" which "are not Individu- als but States: Combinations of Individuals" (M 32[35]:1O-14; E 131)-that is, nations or peoples as well as individual states of mind. Indeed, the national state and the mental state of its citizens reinforce each other almost deterministically-but not quite so, since we must "distinguish ... States from Individuals in those States. / States Change: but Individual Identities never change nor cease" (M 32[35]:22-23; E 132). "States Exist now Man Passes on ... he passes thro them like a traveller" (E 556). The transition from the Songs and The Marriage to the Prophetic Books of the 1790s represents Blake's struggle to narrativize, and thus historicize, his early concept of "Two Contrary States of the Human Soul" (E 7) in response to the disappointments of the French Revolution. The doctrine of multiple, historically conditioned States implicit in the narrative stages of The Book of Urizen, explicitly formulated and extended to the author himself in Milton, and then broadened in Jerusalem to encompass all of British history, past, present and future, depicts subjectivity as a series of provisional "subject- positions" into which a person is called by the specific social dis- courses of the day. Increasingly, Blake's mythological universe comprises the author's internalized mental representations of the world, their shaping influence on his actions, and, in turn the world's responses to those actions as perceived by him through the filter of his representations. So far from appearing in propria per- sona as the bard who present, past, and future sees, Blake comes to look more like a Foucauldian "author-function," a locus of contes- tatory social-historical forces of which his "proper person" is only one constituent among many. Even so, the Book of Urizen ends with the emergence of ordinary fallen time and space. Blake refrains from extending its history to Andrew M. Cooper 625</page><page sequence="42">1794, the time of writing, for to do so would force him to abandon the safety of impersonal narration and confront his own involve- ment in the events he is describing. Hence the increasingly direct autobiography of his later poems: the intermittent autobiographical allegories in The Four Zoas, the consistent but concealed personal allegory in the Bard's Song of Milton, a poem that culminates when the author casts off his mythological shroud and steps into the nar- rative in propria persona, and finally the all-but-explicit allegory of Los's struggle with the Spectre of anxious self-doubt and the au- thor's ongoing efforts to compose Jerusalem. These developments disclose a gradual about face whereby Blake recognizes his own paranoia as an inescapable intersubjective concomitant of his cul- ture's, his satirical critique of the latter notwithstanding. Take, for example, Blake's breakthrough letter to Hayley of 1804, the date carved on the title pages of both Milton and Jerusalem. When Blake compares himself to Nebuchadnezzar, who "had seven times passed over him; I have had twenty; thank God I was not altogether a beast as he was" (E 756), he implicitly acknowledges his identity with his earlier depictions of a beast-like Nebuchad- nezzar about the time of Urizen. Blake's 1795 print of the depraved king crawling across a cave floor, his humanity visible only in his expression of terror and self-disgust (figure 14), suggests Urizen exploring his dens and "sicken'd to see" their "Dread terrors" (23:7-8; E 81).61 On the other hand, such are the reciprocities of projective identification, Blake's illustration of the den-exploring Urizen in the poem (pl. 23B) directly anticipates several images of Los using "his globe of fire to search the interiors of Albions / Bosom" (J 45 [31]:3-4; E 194), as in the frontispiece of Jerusalem. Moreover, since Nebuchadnezzar was a longstanding archetype of royal tyranny, so that a portrayal of his madness would almost in- evitably have constituted an attack on the mad George III, Blake's letter suggests that he now sees his own "times" of madness as a polarized mirror-image of the king's. Similarly, the letter's next admission, "I was a slave bound in a mill among beasts and devils [but] now . . . my feet and my wife's feet are free from fetters,' less recalls the heroic Samson than the mill through which the devilish narrator of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell takes his angelic antagonist, thence descending into a subterranean pit full of cannibalistic "monkeys, baboons, &amp; all of that species ... witheld by the shortness of their chains" (pl. 20; E 42). Although this Mem- 626 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="43">1S_ | |.................................................................................................................................CAD _1| l _ l l t0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~O . l_ * | | f l | i I I | l s l | i!

If all that we see is owing to our metaphysics, as the narrator says, then the narrator is necessarily implicated in his own loath- some vision of angelic reasoning. It is his vision, even if he is right in thinking it prophetic of the angel's future. Some such awareness underlies the peroration of Blake's Milton, who proposes To cast aside from Poetry, all that is not Inspiration That it no longer shall dare to mock with the aspersion of Madness Cast on the Inspired, by the tame high finisher of paltry Blots, Indefinite, or paltry Rhymes; or paltry Harmonies. Who creeps into State Government like a catterpiller to destroy (M 41[48]:7-11; E 142). The twisted syntax is revealing. The tame finisher of paltry blots whose poetry mocks the inspired with the aspersion of madness is partly Blake's erstwhile patron Hayley, whose "Genteel Ignorance &amp; Polite Disapprobation" and "imbecile attempts to depress Me" make him, Blake confides in his letters, "the Enemy of my Spiritual Life while he pretends to be the Friend of my Corporeal" (E 730- 31, 728). Partly, too, the tame finisher is Sir Joshua Reynolds, the head of the Royal Academy "Hired to Depress Art," who together with Gainsborough "Blotted &amp; Blurred one against the other &amp; Divided all the English World between them," and whose Works, addressed "To the King," Blake repeatedly annotates as "A mock" (E 636-38). Clearly, Reynolds is among those opposed in Milton's Preface as "Hirelings in the Camp, the Court, &amp; the University: who would if they could, for ever depress Mental &amp; prolong Cor- poreal War" (pl. 1; E 95). But the enemy is also Blake himself, whose work during his Felpham sojourn was, he confesses else- where, "molested continually by blotting and blurring demons" (E 546). Blake's letter of January 10, 1803 shows that the steady, if dull, employment available under Hayley had become an agonizing temptation to "refuse to do Spiritual Acts. because of Natural Fears or Natural Desires! Who can describe the dismal torments of such a state! ... Sorrow &amp; Desperation pursues you thro life! &amp; after death shame &amp; confusion of face to eternity" (E 724-25). In this 628 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="45">sense, the cultivated but weakly Palamabron of Milton is not simply Hayley, as S. Foster Damon showed, but the Hayley within Blake, as Harold Bloom surmised.62 A similar interlocking of the personal and the political appears in the poem's description of "the idiot Questioner who is always questioning, / But never capable of an- swering; who sits with a sly grin / Silent plotting when to question, like a thief in a cave" (M 41 [48]:12-14; E 142). Most obviously, the idiot questioner is Blake's Burke-faced assassin of Europe (figure 12), and perhaps by extension the government prosecutor at his Felpham trial for sedition in January 1804. But the business of engraving was fraught with like perils. With his trial recently over and England preparing to resume war against France, Blake viewed his difficulties finding employment upon his return to Lon- don in political terms: "Engravers, Painters, Statuaries, Printers, Poets we are not in a field of battle, but in a City of Assassinations where "every calumny and falsehood utter'd against another of the same trade is thought fair play" (E 751). In a sense, then, the idiot questioner is Blake's personal vulnerability to "State Govern- ment," specifically censorship, in the form of the doubting Spectre, "a Negation, a meer / Reasoning &amp; Derogation from me, an Object- ing &amp; cruel Spite" (I 17:37-38; E 162). Thus the main threat to vision is not tyranny per se but its inter- nalization. On the aesthetic level, mind control takes the form of "'temptations and perturbations ... called Chiarco Oscuro, in the hands of Venetian and Flemish Demons" (E 547) that impede Blake's art. On the political level, it reveals itself in his excessive suspicion of surveillance by government informers, "the little blasts of fear / That the hireling blows into my ear" (E 473).63 Ac- cordingly, Los in Jerusalem struggles to regard his excruciating self-division as, not the curse of fallenness, but his raison d'etre as artist and prophet; after all, his heroic labors would be unnecessary in an unfallen world, and will be superfluous come the apocalypse. Ironically, the poem shows, it is our self-preoccupied fear of self- collapse and loss of control that actually induces these conditions. Since "The Spectre is, in Giant Man; insane, and most deform'd" (33[37]:4; E 179), Los controls him not by anxiously denying his insanity, which would only augment his separateness, but by forc- ing him to assist in the work of redemption: "Tho my Spectre is divided: as I am a Living Man / I must compell him to obey me wholly" (17:16-17; E 161). Coercion is necessary because the Spec- tre "is the Reasoning Power / An abstract objecting power, that Andrew M. Cooper 629</page><page sequence="46">Negatives every thing," so that arguing against it is, paradoxically, to succumb to it. Realizing this, Los is adamant: "I will not Reason &amp; Compare: my business is to Create" (I 10:13-14, 21; E 153). Yet the preceding passage also asserts Los "must Create a Sys- tem, or be enslav'd by another Mans" (10:20; E 153). He is "Striv- ing with Systems to deliver Individuals from those Systems" (11:5; E 154), the "with" signifying that he works both "against" systems and "by means of' them. As in Althusser, the subject is interpel- lated through ideological interventions, and the resulting con- sciousness is always more or less false. This is evident in Jerusa- lem's three prefaces, each addressed to a different group of readers. By veiling his beliefs in the ideological language he thinks best suited to his target audience, Blake prophetically exploits his con- temporary State for contrary purposes. For example, when he tells the Deists that "Man is born a Spectre or Satan &amp; is altogether an Evil," he is countering the rationalism of "Voltaire Rousseau Gib- bon Hume"-proponents of "Natural Religion and Natural Philoso- phy, and of Natural Morality or Self-Righteousness, the Selfish Vir- tues of the Natural Heart" (I 52; E 200-01) that lead to hypocrisy- with the strongest possible statement about man's need of Christian humility and forgiveness. His statement looks like an orthodox as- sertion of original sin, yet it is not incompatible with his radical epistemology whereby the material world we call reality is seen to be the product of deluded perception. Similarly, when he goes on to argue that "Man must &amp; will have Some Religion; if he has not the Religion of Jesus, he will have the Religion of Satan," he is employing just the sort of pragmatism that his rationalist opponents are most likely to find convincing. Indeed, in the illustration to this preface (pl. 51) and its original pencil sketch Blake evidently asso- ciates Deism with reasoning madness (figure 15). In both pictures, we see the despairing figures of Vala, queen of nature, slumped dejectedly on her stony throne in a pose reminiscent of Dfirer's Melancholia, Hyle or materialism sitting on the ground in the fa- miliar Urizenic position, and Skofeld, an image of despairing self- doubt fettered and with shaven head.64 Significantly, the original sketch includes a hairy crawling figure as well (probably Hand). His resemblance to Blake's depictions of the depraved Nebuchad- nezzar, the striking likeness between his fierce expression and that of George Bell's madman, his spiky hair, upraised head and re- straining collar all mark him as a "raving" madman. Hence Blake's 630 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="47">-~~~~~~~~~~4 I _ 1vi Andrew M. Cooper 631</page><page sequence="48">decision to excise him from the Jerusalem plate: he has no place beside the three listless, downward-gazing melancholics emblem- atic of Deism's cold, reasoning madness. The Evangelical humility of Jerusalem's opening address To the Public is similarly double-edged, as the deletions (restored and bracketed) in the opening paragraph attest: After my three years slumber on the banks of the Ocean, I again display my Giant forms to the Public: My former Giants &amp; Fairies having receiv'd the highest reward possible: the [love] and [friendship] of those with whom to be connected, is to be [blessed]: I cannot doubt that this more consolidated &amp; extended Work, will be as kindly received (pl. 3; E 145). Regardless of how Blake might have revised the paragraph or of what he initially intended, the fact that he evidently had the thought of replacing the deleted words with their contraries, "hatred," "enmity," and "damned," alerts us to a devilish irony. If his former work has attained the prestige of being rejected and ignored by fools-obscurity in one's time being a mark of true ge- nius, as the later Blake repeatedly asserts-then this new poem, longer and more complex than its predecessors, will surely merit even higher honors. One suspects similar irony when the author goes on to say, "I am perhaps the most sinful of men! I pretend not to holiness! yet I pretend to love, to see, to converse with daily, as man with man, &amp; the more to have an interest in the Friend of Sinners." Is Blake insinuating it is his very sinfulness-at least, his sinfulness in terms of "what the religious call Good &amp; Evil" (MHH 3; E 34)-that puts him on such intimate terms with Jesus? Angels and devils in the audience able to pose the question are likely to answer, each group according to its own convictions, that Blake is "pretending" indeed. At any rate, the fact that Blake's extensive post-Felpham correspondence with Hayley employs strikingly sim- ilar language, as Blake again and again goes out of his way to thank Hayley for having impelled him toward his current enlightened state, shows that the question here is historical as well as rhetorical. Indeed, Blake's apology for "The Enthusiasm of the following Poem" sounds much like the Eclectic Review's defense of enthu- siasm upon the posthumous publication of William Cowper's Mem- oir in 1816: The Enthusiast is merely an individual in whom the passions are more habitually in a state of excitation, and the imagination op- 632 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="49">erates with the force of a stimulus. The man's sanity must be determined by the course his reason takes, by the nature of the object which engages all this enthusiasm, by the steadiness and consistency with which he presses forward in its attainment. And if the object chosen be infinite, surely it is the enthusiast alone that is altogether sane.65 The question of excessive religiosity, particularly Evangelical en- thusiasm, occasioned the most debate among early sociologists of madness. Cowper's case became a focal point for opposing views, one side arguing that his bouts of suicidal madness were caused by his Evangelical sense of guilt, the other side claiming that his Evan- gelical faith alone kept him from a lifetime of unremitting despair 66 The remarks of the Eclectic reviewer attempt to refute the standard nervous" argument that, as Spurzheim puts it, "Whatever occu- pies the mind too intensely or exclusively is hurtful to the brain, and induces a state favorable to insanity" (114)-an argument whose corollary was that ''religion often leads to insanity" (Spurzheim goes on to cite Haslam's "obligation to Methodism for its supply of numerous cases" [115]). Blake's annotations to Spurzheim single out these remarks: Methodism &amp;c ... Cowper came to me &amp; said. 0 that I were insane always I will never rest. Can you not make me truly in- sane. I will never rest until I am so. 0 that in the bosom of God I was hid. You retain health &amp; yet are as mad as any of us all- over us all-mad as a refuge from unbelief-from Bacon Newton &amp; Locke. (E 663) As Morton Paley points out, to Blake Cowper was not "truly" mad because his faith was tainted by his terrible Calvinistic despair that God, having regenerated him through faith, had withdrawn His mercy and damned him (246-47). In contrast, Blake's belief in a God of infinite forgiveness makes his madness "healthy." Accord- ingly, when Spurzheim sides with physicians who "acknowledge only corporeal diseases," declaring "I have no idea of any disease, or of any derangement of an immaterial being itself, such as the mind or soul is. The soul cannot fall sick, any more than it can die" (75), Blake retorts: "Diseases of the mind I pity him. Denies mental health and perfection" (E 662). Anne Mellor explains, "Blake here argues that the mind, and not the body, creates mental health as well as mental disease."67 Thus Cowper's madness reflected not his religious enthusiasm, but his failure to resist the current reli- gious State's distortion of such enthusiasm via "the twenty-seventh Andrew M. Cooper 633</page><page sequence="50">Church" "named Luther" (M 35[39]:61-62; E 136)-that is to say, the lingering predestinarian aspect of Protestantism. Jerusalem's opening address elicits the same distinction by demonstrating that the author's avowal of sinfulness leads not to despair but to height- ened faith because, unlike Cowper's, it is accompanied by a con- viction that "the Spirit of Jesus is continual forgiveness of Sin." Nor are these manipulations of audience necessarily undertaken in what ideological puritans would call "bad" faith. The reductive, self-validating nature of fallen perception warrants a contradictory response: "The Visions of Eternity, by reason of narrowed percep- tions, / Are become weak Visions of Time &amp; Space, fix'd into fur- rows of death; / Till deep dissimulation is the only defence an hon- est man has left" (J 49:21-23; E 198). If ideology is, like Blake's Satan, essentially false consciousness, then it cannot be betrayed or destroyed, only exposed. The honest man dissimulates "That he who will not defend Truth, may be compelld to defend / A Lie" (I 9:29-30; E 152). Only by recognizing the ways in which subjectivi- ty has become implicated in the systems of knowledge, power, and ideology that supply its consciousness and reinforce its "subject'' status can Blake develop an ethics of resistance-namely, "self- annihilation" both as an article of religious belief and a means of aesthetic production-and so approach an at least provisionally au- thentic self.68 Inasmuch as Blake's exemplar of self-annihilation is Jesus Christ regarded as pure, unconstrained humanity, Blake's anti-ideological ethic remains circumscribed by the Romantic ideology of transcen- dental idealism, as Jerome McGann points out.69 But I think Blake recognized this contradiction. What makes possible the contrary method of Jerusalem is the historicist conclusion of Milton, which compels the author to step forth into his poem as a limited individu- al whose vision of Jesus is no less poignantly transitory than it is sublimely apocalyptic, being at once the providentially arranged culmination of the poem and a bone-jarring return to the contingent material world, the basis of any subsequent prophecy. And yet since the poem actually depicts these events, its historicism re- mains necessarily incomplete-or rather, it remains all-too- spuriously neat and "finished." Accordingly, the character Blake no sooner appears within the narrative than he passes out of it, liter- ally, by fainting. Moving beyond self-representation, the author thus opens himself to a new identity, one determined partly by the historical Blake's Jerusalem, itself already implicit in Milton's end- 634 Blake and Madness</page><page sequence="51">ing, but partly also by children of a future age reading that indig- nant sage sometimes as he hoped to be read, and sometimes in a manner that is finally truer to his contrary method, not.

Tuke's description accords exactly with what the current standard diagnostic manual DSM 3 terms "obsessive compulsion disorder." David Hack Tuke was the nephew of Samuel Tuke, author of A Description of the Retreat: An Institution near York (1813), who was the grandson of William Tuke, founder of the York Retreat. As the history of the Monros also shows, the business of madness was very much a family affair during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 31 Michel Foucault, Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason, trans. Richard Howard (New York: Random House, 1965), 107. Further references will appear in the text. Foucault's critique of moral management, particu- larly as practiced by William Tuke at the celebrated York Retreat, seems similarly confused. When he argues that "Tuke created an asylum where he substituted for the free terror of madness the stifling anguish of responsibility" (247), he seems to assume that by definition madness is "free" and responsibility a "stifling anguish." Quoting Samuel Tuke on the tea-parties organized at the Retreat for the inmates and keepers where all would "dress in their best clothes, and vie with each other in politeness and propriety. The best fare is provided, and the visitors are treated with all the attention of strangers," Foucault comments: Curiously, this rite is not one of intimacy, of dialogue, of mutual acquain- tance; it is the organization around the madman of a world where every- thing would be like and near him, but in which he himself would remain a stranger, the Stranger par excellence who is judged not-only by appear- ances but by all that they may betray and reveal in spite of themselves. drawn to the surface of himself by a social personality silently imposed by observation, by form and mask, the madman is obliged to objectify himself in the eyes of reason as the perfect stranger, that is, as the man whose strangeness does not reveal itself (249-50). But how else does one come to know another but by appearances; and when trying to judge whether the other is indeed worthy "of intimacy, of dialogue, of mutual acquaintance," what other way than by interested observation, which is to say, by an attempt to penetrate beneath appearances to "all that they may betray in spite of Andrew M. Cooper 637</page><page sequence="54">themselves"? Isn't the objectification of a social personality requisite for any social interaction? To communicate without a mask, and without one's respondents at- tempting to penetrate the mask by observation: isn't this an annihilation of the otherness without which social relationships collapse in solipsism? Notwithstanding his claim that "madness is ultimately nothing" (107), Foucault romanticizes mad- ness as harboring an authenticity or essence which contact with the social world can only contaminate.

English Madness: Ideas on In- sanity, 1580-1890 (London: Routledge, 1979), 56. For one of the main categories to emerge was, precisely, curable insanity.

Simmons, 1790): "In moral arrangements, and in prudential preparation for the first impressions of society, the royal system was extremely defective. The education of the King had been monastic.... The moment of your Royal Highness's emancipation was that of a prisoner from confinement" (2). Thus the pro-French Williams insinuates a par- allel between George's emancipation from Bute upon acceding to the throne not to mention his more recent emancipation from the restraints imposed during his mad- ness-and the liberation of the Bastille: George having known first-hand the op- pressiveness of "the royal system," he should be able to sympathize with French republican strivings for freedom. Possibly, Williams's remarks on the young George's repressed upbringing are also intended to explain a prominent symptom of his madness: his manic talkativeness for hours at a stretch to anybody and every- body, even, it was reported, to a tree. Gillray's "Affability" (1795), a parody of "Farmer George" (as he was called) speaking nonstop to a bewildered rustic, may allude to his insane loquacity. 42 A sampling of views is provided by J. Drakard, Drakard's Political Spirit of the Press, on the Death of George the Third, Embodying the Political Disquisitions of the Most Popular Writers of the Day ... (London: J. Drakard, 1820). In its obituary of 1820, The Irishman treats George as tyranny personified. After attacking him for his wars against America and revolutionary France and his oppression of Ireland and India, the article concludes: "Thus has the reign of George the Third been distin- guished by four great successive struggles against the liberty of mankind in the four corners of the world-the west and the east, the north and the south" (Drakard 29). Cf. Stanley Ayling's assessment: "His pugnacity was as firm as his conviction of the propriety of his own actions, his dogged tenacity in the face of setbacks and disasters as unwavering and unneutral as his conservatism." George the Third (London: Col- lins, 1972), 457. 43 Cf. Samuel Tuke: "No advantage has been found to arise from reasoning with [melancholics] on their particular hallucinations. ...

More drastically, many moral managers con- sidered sudden fear or surprise beneficial because it could overwhelm the faulty delusion and ensuing chain of associations. As Thomas Bakewell argued, "in our endeavours to counteract the erroneous thoughts of lunatics we are not to expect anything but mischief, from the powers of thought upon their hallucinations; all we can do is to promote a new train of mental images." The Domestic Guide in Cases of Insanity (Stafford, 1805), 38. Foucault's betes noires, the rotatory chair and surprise trap-floor dousings in cold water, were designed to shock the patient's deluded senses back to normal. No doubt, Foucault is correct that these therapies often lost their putative therapeutic value and served as punishments, but inasmuch as all institutions tend to put their own administrative needs ("smooth running") ahead of the people they are supposed to serve, the ideological thrust of Foucault's observa- tion seems blunted. 44 Cf. Sir Gilbert Elliott: "The physicians, in the report they sent to St. James's talk of fever, but I am inclined to believe that he has never yet had any fever, in the Andrew M. Cooper 639</page><page sequence="56">common acceptance of that word, and that they must avail themselves of some occasional quickness of pulse to avoid the true name of his disorder, and also to avoid the declaration of the circumstance which would make his case much more hopeless-I mean that of delirium without fever."

See also William Rowley's defense of his claim that "Madness or insanity is an alienation of the mind without fever"-a claim alleged to be falla- cious "because His Majesty's late indisposition was attended with fever" (8-9). Rowley begins by distinguishing between "symptomatic delirium" occasioned by some external physical cause such as fever, and "ideopathic disease," which is "a disorder of itself' such as "phrensy" or "madness." He then demonstrates by an account of George's activities the week before and after the onset of madness that he had fever and inflammation from gout, rheumatism and a "severe biliary attack"; thus his "disorder was positively a symptomatic or febrile delirium; and every reason unites to conclude the cure will be permanent." Truth Vindicated: or, the Specific Differences of Mental Diseases Ascertained, (London: Fe Wingrave, 1790), 49. So well known were the disagreements among George's doctors that even Pinel (note 30) remarks the "jealousy and intrigue" that motivated the other doctors to question Willis's judgment and then equivocate under inquiry by the Privy Council (286-90). 45 The Life and Times of F.

"9 Conolly (note 20) agrees with Monro that the true criterion of madness is faulty judgment or "A DEFECT IN THE COMPARING FACULTY" (300), such that the madman doesn't simply suffer a delusion-for as Monro points out, delusions can be the product of mental disorders having nothing to do with insanity, such as drunk- enness or hypochondria-but is acually convinced of the delusion's external reality. Conolly's outwardly unlikely agreement with Monro points to the fact that the psy- chiatric advances of the middle and later nineteenth century were generated not by the liberal humanitarianism of the Tukes but by the somatic emphasis of the con- servative and utilitarian traditions.

Since the knife-wielding figure is clearly based on Spenser's Despair, the prints invite a psychological interpretation: the recumbent figures ex- hibit various aspects of the death-in-life of mental derangement, the culmination of which is the "eternal death" of despair. 65 Eclectic Review 6 (October, 1816): 320. Quoted in Morton Paley, "Cowper as Blake's Spectre," Eighteenth Century Studies 1 (1968): 249-50. 66 See Max Byrd, Visits to Bedlam: Madness and Literature in the Eighteenth Century (Columbia, S.C.: Univ. of South Carolina Press, 1974), 154. Although the Memoir of the Early Life of William Cowper, Esq., Written by Himself wasn't published until 1816, its contents had long been known through the biographies of Robert Southey and William Hayley. The line between the Tory and Whig positions blurs when one considers that although conservatives tended to regard Evangeli- calism as a threat to the social order, most radicals thought it far too amenable to the status quo (consider Blake's parodies of Hannah More in the homiletic last lines of the "The Chimney Sweeper" and "Holy Thursday" in Songs of Innocence). During the post-Waterloo retrenchment, on the other hand, a radical like Blake could regard the blind heat of Evangelical piety as preferable, despite its conformist tendencies, to the cold light of monarchical state-religion. 67 K.
