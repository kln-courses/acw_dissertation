<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Red Snow. By James Greiner. (New York: Doubleday, 1980. 260 pages, $10.95.) In James Greiner's book The Red Snow we share the experiences of a wolf pack for one calendar year. The book opens with the birth of four pups deep beneath a tundra meadow in the Alaskan interior. The story richens as we become acquainted with each member of the pack and the land they inhabit. We follow the development of the pups from playful toddlers into important pack members, witness the awesome power of the alpha male as he disembowels a moose, suffer the numbing agony of starvation, and finally match wits with a trapper named Jack Tatum. Greiner wrote in his introduction to The Red Snow that he wished to rework the generally "unpalatable" scientific literature on wolves into a readable narrative. This he does well. Greiner is a long-time Alaskan resi- dent who knows its wildlife - you will learn a great deal about wolves reading this book. There are some details questioned by biologists in the Fairbanks area. For instance, they now feel that very little inbreeding occurs in wolf packs, which conflicts with what Greiner portrays. These points are, they feel, inconsequential, and note Greiner's remarkable detail and sensitivity in his portrayal of pack life. The Red Snow is also the story of an aging trapper. Here is the counter- theme of, simply put, man versus beast. But its magnitude is great; Greiner</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 241 forces us into the uncomfortable position of viewing man as H. erectus. Jack Tatum, like many Alaskans, finds bush life the only recourse to societal demands and sprawling urban centers. What really lies behind Tatum's veneer of solidity and complacency? Greiner slaps us with this question in the book's climax, ending in Tatum's revengeful attack on the pack, which costs his life. The "isness" of this book is its strength. Greiner is careful not to become anthropomorphic or to overwrite. Margaret Murie commends Greiner in her excellent foreword for portraying the wolves "simply as they are: wild animals, admirable, efficient, beautiful, that have learned the intricate and demanding laws of survival." Greiner is a veteran writer of the Arctic, having already produced an Alaskan classic, Wager with the Wind, the story of the late Don Sheldon, a famous bush pilot and now Alaskan folk hero. Gauged by the immediate acceptance in the Fairbanks area (Greiner's hometown), The Red Snow should also earn a place on numerous Alaskan bookshelves. JOHN C.
