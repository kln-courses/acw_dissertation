<plain_text><page sequence="1">GRAND STREET SYLVIA PLATH AND HER JOURNALS Ted Hughes ylvia Plath's journals exist as an assortment of notebooks and bunches of loose sheets, and the selection just pub lished here* contains about a third of the whole bulk. Two other notebooks survived for a while after her death. They continued from where the surviving record breaks off in late 1959 and covered the last three years of her life. The second of these two books her husband destroyed, because he did not want her children to have to read it (in those days he regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of sur vival). The earlier one disappeared more recently (and may, presumably, still turn up). The motive in publishing these journals will be ques tioned. The argument against is still strong. A decisive fac tor has been certain evident confusions, provoked in the minds of many of her readers by her later poetry. Ariel is dramatic speech of a kind. But to what persona and to what drama is it to be fitted? The poems don't seem to supply enough evidence of the definitive sort. This might have been no bad thing, if a riddle fertile in hypotheses is a good one. But the circumstances of her death, it seems, multi plied every one of her statements by a wild, unknown quantity. The results, among her interpreters, have hardly been steadied by the account she gave of herself in her let ters to her mother, or by the errant versions supplied by her biographers. So the question grows: how do we find our way through this accompaniment, which has now become almost a part of the opus? Would we be helped if we had more firsthand testimony, a more intimately assured image, of what she was really like? In answer to this, these papers, which contain the nearest thing to a living portrait of her, are offered in the hope of providing some ballast for our idea of the reality behind the poems. Maybe they will do more. Looking over this curtailed journal, we cannot help won *The Journal.s of Sylvia Plath, edited by Ted Hughes and Frances McCullough, The Dial Press. [86]</page><page sequence="2">TED HUGHES dering whether the lost entries for her last three years were not the more important section of it. Those years, after all, produced the work that made her name. And we certainly have lost a valuable appendix to all that later writing. Yet these surviving diaries contain something that cannot be less valuable. If we read them with understanding, they can give us the key to the most intriguing mystery about her, the key to our biggest difficulty in our approach to her poetry. That difficulty is the extreme peculiarity in kind of her poetic gift. And the difficulty is not lessened by the fact that she left behind two completely different kinds of poetry. Few poets have disclosed in 'any way the birth circum stances of their poetic gift, or the necessary purpose these serve in their psychic economy. It is not easy to name one. As if the first concern of poetry were to cover its own tracks. When a deliberate attempt to reveal all has been made, by a Pasternak or a Wordsworth, the result is discursive auto biography-illuminating enough, but not an X-ray. Other wise poets are very properly bent on exploring subject mat ter, themes, intellectual possibilities and modifications, evolving the foliage and blossoms and fruit of a natural cul tural organism whose roots are hidden, and whose birth and private purpose are no part of the crop. Sylvia Plath's poetry, like a species on its own, exists in little else but the revelation of that birth and purpose. Though her whole considerable ambition was fixed on becoming the normal flowering and fruiting kind of writer, her work was roots only. Almost as if her entire oeuvre were enclosed within those processes and transformations that happen in other poets before they can even begin, before the muse can hold out a leaf. Or as if all poetry were made up of the feats and shows performed by the poetic spirit Ariel. Whereas her poetry is the biology of Ariel, the ontology of Ariel-the story of Ariel's imprisonment in the pine, before Prospero opened it. And it continued to be so even after the end of The Colossus, which fell, as it happens, in the last entries of this surviving bulk of her journal, where the opening of the pine took place and was recorded. This singularity of hers is a mystery-an enigma in itself. It may be that she was simply an extreme case, that many [87]</page><page sequence="3">GRAND STREET other poets' works nurse and analyze their roots as dog gedly as hers do, but that she is distinguished by an unusu ally clear root system and an abnormally clear and clinically exact system of attending to it. It may be something to do with the fact that she was a woman. Maybe her singularity derives from a feminine beeline instinct for the real prior ity, for what truly matters-an instinct for nursing and repairing the damaged and threatened nucleus of the self and for starving every other aspect of her life in order to feed and strengthen that, and bring that to a safe delivery. The root system of her talent was a deep and inclusive inner crisis which seems to have been quite distinctly for mulated in its chief symbols (presumably going back at least as far as the death of her father, when she was ten) by the time of her first attempted suicide, in 1953, when she was twenty-one. After 1953, it became a much more serious business, a continuous hermetically sealed process that changed only very slowly, so that for years it looked like deadlock. Though its preoccupation dominated her life, it remained largely outside her ordinary consciousness, but in her poems we see the inner working of it. It seems to have been scarcely disturbed at all by the outer upheavals she passed through, by her energetic involvement in her studies, in her love affairs and her marriage, and in her jobs, though she used details from them as a matter of course for images to develop her X-rays. The importance of these diaries lies in the rich account they give of her attempts to understand this obscure pro cess, to follow it, and (in vain) to hasten it. As time went on, she interpreted what was happening to her inwardly, more and more consciously, as a "drama" of some sort. After its introductory overture (everything up to 1953), the drama proper began with a "death," which was followed by a long "gestation" or "regeneration," which in turn would ulti mately require a "birth" or a "rebirth," as in Dostoevsky and Lawrence and those other prophets of rebirth whose works were her sacred books. The "death," so important in all that she wrote after it, was that almost successful suicide attempt in the summer of 1953. The mythical dimensions of the experience seem to [88]</page><page sequence="4">TED HUGHES have been deepened, and made absolute, and illuminated, by two accidents: she lay undiscovered, in darkness, only intermittently half-conscious, for "three days"; and the electric shock treatment which followed went wrong, and she was all but electrocuted-at least so she always claimed. Whether it did and she was, or not, there seems little doubt that her "three day" death, and that thunder bolt awakening, fused her dangerous inheritance into a matrix from which everything later seemed to develop-as from a radical change in the structure of her brain. She would describe her suicide attempt as a bid to get back to her father, and one can imagine that in her case this was a routine reconstruction, from a psychoanalytical point of view. But she made much of it, and it played an increas ingly dominant role in her recovery and in what her poetry was able to become. Some of the implications might be divined from her occasional dealings with the Ouija board, during the late fifties. Her father's name was Otto, and "spirits" would regularly arrive with instructions for her from one Prince Otto, who was said to be a great power in the underworld. When she pressed for a more personal communication, she would be told that Prince Otto could not speak to her directly, because he was under orders from The Colossus. And when she pressed for an audience with The Colossus, they would say he was inaccessible. It is easy to see how her effort to come to terms with the meaning this Colossus held for her, in her poetry, became more and more central as the years passed. The strange limbo of "gestation/regeneration," which fol lowed her "death," lasted throughout the period of this journal, and she drew from the latter part of it all the poems of The Colossus, her first collection. We have spoken of this process as a "nursing" of the "nucleus of the self," as a hermetically sealed, slow transformation of her inner crisis; and the evidence surely supports these descriptions of it as a deeply secluded mythic and symbolic inner theater (sometimes a hospital theater), accessible to her only in her poetry. One would like to emphasize even more strongly the weird autonomy of what was going on in there. It gave the impression of being a secret crucible, or rather a womb, an almost biological process-and just as much beyond her [89]</page><page sequence="5">GRAND STREET manipulative interference. And like a pregnancy, selfish with her resources. We can hardly make too much of this special condition, both in our understanding of her journal and in our reading of the poems of her first book. A reader of the journal might wonder why she did not make more of day-to-day events. She had several outlandish adventures during these years, and interesting things were always happening to her. But her diary entries habitually ignore them. When she came to talk to herself in these pages, that magnetic inner process seemed to engross all her attention, one way or another. And in her poems and stories, throughout this period, she felt her creative dependence on that same process as sub jection to a tyrant. It commandeered every proposal. Many passages in this present book show the deliberate-almost frantic-effort with which she tried to extend her writing, to turn it toward the world and other people, to stretch it over more of outer reality, to forget herself in some explora tion of outer reality-in which she took, after all, such con stant, intense delight. But the hidden workshop, the tangle of roots, the crucible, controlled everything. Everything became another image of itself, another lens into itself. And whatever it could not use in this way, to objectify some dis closure of itself, did not get onto the page at all. Unless we take account of this we shall almost certainly misread the moods of her journal-her nightmare sense of claustrophobia and suspended life, her sense of being only the flimsy, brittle husk of what was going heavily and fierily on, somewhere out of reach inside her. And we shall proba bly find ourselves looking into her poems for things and qualities which could only be there if that process had been less fiercely concentrated on its own purposeful chemistry. We shall misconstrue the tone and content of the poetry that did manage to transmit from the center, and the psy chological exactness and immediacy of its mournful, stress ful confinement. A Jungian might call the whole phase a classic case of the alchemical individuation of the self. This interpretation would not tie up every loose end, but it would make posi tive meaning of the details of the poetic imagery-those silent horrors going on inside a glass crucible, a crucible [90]</page><page sequence="6">TED HUGHES that reappears in many forms, but always glassy and always closed. Above all, perhaps, it would help to confirm a truth-that the process was, in fact, a natural and positive process, if not the most positive and healing of all involun tary responses to the damage of life: a process of self-salva tion-a resurrection of her deepest spiritual vitality against the odds of her fate. And the Jungian interpretation would fit the extraordinary outcome too: the birth of her new cre ative self. The significant thing, even so, in the progress she made, was surely the way she applied herself to the task. Her bat tered and so-often-exhausted determination, the relentless way she renewed the assault without ever really knowing what she was up against. The seriousness, finally, of her will to face what was wrong in herself, and to drag it out into examination, and to remake it-that is what is so impressive. Her refusal to rest in any halfway consolation or evasive delusion. And it produced some exemplary pieces of writing, here and there, in her diaries. It would not be so impressive if she were not so manifestly terrified of doing what she nevertheless did. At times, she seems almost invalid in her lack of inner protections. Her writing here (as in her poems) simplifies itself in baring itself to what hurts her. It is unusually devoid of intellectual superstructures of provisional ideas, theorizings, developed fantasies, which are all protective clothing as well as tools. What she did have, clearly, was character-and passionate character at that. One sees where the language of Ariel got its temper-that unique blend of courage and vulnerability. The notion of her forcing herself, in her "Japanese silks, desperate butterflies," deeper into some internal furnace, strengthens throughout these pages, and remains. But she was getting somewhere. Late in 1959 (toward the end of the surviving diaries) she had a dream,which at the time made a visionary impact on her, in which she was try ing to reassemble a giant, shattered, stone Colossus. In the light of her private mythology, we can see this dream was momentous, and she versified it, addressing the ruins as "Father," in a poem which she regarded, at the time, as a breakthrough. But the real significance of the dream emerges, perhaps, a few days later, when the quarry of [91]</page><page sequence="7">GRAND STREET anthropomorphic ruins reappears, in a poem titled "The Stones." In this second poem, the ruins are no other than the hospital city, the factory where men are remade, and where, among the fragments, a new self has been put together. Or rather an old shattered self, reduced by vio lence to its essential core, has been repaired and renovated and born again, and-most significant of all-speaks with a new voice. This "birth" is the culmination of her prolonged six-year "drama." It is doubtful whether we would be reading this journal at all if the "birth" recorded in that poem, "The Stones," had not happened in a very real sense, in November 1959. The poem is the last of a sequence titled "Poem For A Birthday." Her diary is quite informative about her plans for this piece, which began as little more than an experi mental poetic idea that offered scope for her to play at imitating Roethke. But evidently there were hidden prompters. As a piece of practical magic, "Poem For A Birthday" came just at the right moment. Afterward, she knew something had happened, but it is only in retrospect that we can see what it was. During the next three years she herself came to view this time as the turning point in her writing career, the point where her, real writing began. Looking back further, maybe we can see signs and por tents before then. Maybe her story "Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams" was the John the Baptist. And in her own recognition of the change, at the time, she spread the honors over several other poems as well-"The Manor Garden" (which is an apprehensive welcome to the approaching unborn), "The Colossus" (which is the poem describing the visionary dream of the ruined Colossus), and "Medallion" (which describes a snake as an undead, unliv ing elemental beauty, a crystalline essence of stone). But this poem, "The Stones," is the thing itself. It is unlike anything that had gone before in her work. The system of association, from image to image and within the images, is quite new, and-as we can now see-it is that of Ariel. And throughout the poem what we hear com ing clear is the now-familiar voice of Ariel. [92]</page><page sequence="8">TED HUGHES In its double focus, "The Stones" is both a "birth" and a "rebirth." It is the birth of her real poetic voice, but it is the rebirth of herself. That poem encapsulates, with literal details, her "death," her treatment, and her slow, buried recovery. And this is where we can see the peculiarity of her imagination at work, where we can see how the sub stance of her poetry and the very substance of her survival are the same. In another poet, "The Stones" might have been an artistic assemblage of fantasy images. But she was incapable of free fantasy, in the ordinary sense. If an image of hers had its source in sleeping or waking "dream," it was inevitably the image of some meaning she had paid for or would have to pay for, in some way-that she had lived or would have to live. It had the necessity of a physical symp tom. This is the objectivity of her subjective mode. Her internal crystal ball was helplessly truthful, in this sense. (And truthfulness of that sort has inescapable inner conse quences.) It determined her lack of freedom, sure enough, as we have already seen. But it secured her loyalty to what was, for her, the most important duty of all. And for this reason the succession of images in "The Stones," in which we see her raising a new self out of the ruins of her mythical father, has to be given the status of fact. The "drama," in which she redeemed and balanced the earlier "death" with this "birth/rebirth," and from which she drew so much con fidence later on, was a great simplification, but we cannot easily doubt that it epitomizes, in ritual form, the main inner labor of her life up to the age of twenty-seven. And this is the story her diaries have to tell: how a poetic talent was forced into full expressive being, by internal need, fbr a purpose vital to the whole organism. "Birth," of the sort we have been talking about, is usually found in the context of a religion, or at least of some mysti cal discipline. It is rare in secular literature. If "The Stones" does indeed record such a birth, we should now look for some notable effects, some exceptional flowering of energy. It is just this second phase of her career that has proved so difficult to judge in conventional literary terms. But whatever followed November 1959, in Sylvia Plath's [93]</page><page sequence="9">GRAND STREET writing, has a bearing on our assessment of what is happen ing in this journal. Shortly after the date of the last poems of The Colossus, and the last date of her diary proper, a big change did come over her life. It took a few weeks to get into its stride. When she sailed for England in December with her hus band, though she had her new, full-formed confidence about her writing to cheer her, her life still seemed sus pended, and all her ambitions as far off as ever. In a poem she wrote soon after, "On Deck," she mentions that one of her fellow passengers on the S.S. United States, an Ameri can astrologer-he was physically a double for James Joyce-had picked that most propitious date for launching his astrological conquest of the British public. His optimism did not rub off on her. With her last college days well behind her, and only writing and maternity ahead, the December London of 1959 gave her a bad shock-the cars seemed smaller and blacker and dingier than ever, sizzling through black wet streets. The clothes on the people seemed even grubbier than she remembered. And when she lay on a bed in a basement room in a scruffy hotel near Victoria, a week or two later with The Rack, by A. E. Ellis, propped open on her pregnant stomach, it seemed to her she had touched a new nadir. Yet within the next three years she achieved one after another almost all the ambitions she had been brooding over in frustration for the last decade. In that first month her collection of poems, The Colossus, was taken for publi cation in England by Heinemann. With that out of the way, in April she produced a daughter. In early 1961, at high speed, and in great exhilaration, she wrote her autobio graphical novel The Bell Jar, and though both Harper and Knopf rejected it in the States, Heinemann took it at once for publication in England. One important part of her life plan was to acquire a "base," as she called it, somewhere in England, from which she hoped to make her raids on the four corners of the earth, devouring the delights and excite ments. And accordingly, later in 1961, she acquired a house in the West of England. In January of 1962 she produced a son. In May of that year The Colossus was published in the States by Knopf. [94]</page><page sequence="10">TED HUGHES Meanwhile, she went on steadily writing her new poems. After the promise of "The Stones," we look at these with fresh attention. And they are different from what had gone before. But superficially not very different. For one thing, there is little sign of Ariel. And she herself seemed to feel that these pieces were an interlude. She published them in magazines, but otherwise let them lie-not exactly rejected by her, but certainly not coaxed anxiously toward a next collection, as this journal shows her worrying over her earlier poems. The demands of her baby occupied her time, but this does not entirely explain the lull in her poetry. The poems themselves, as before, reveal what was going on. Everything about her writing at this time suggests that after 1959, after she had brought her "death-rebirth" drama to a successful issue, she found herself confronted, on that inner stage, by a whole new dramatic situation-one that made her first drama seem no more than the preliminaries, before the lifting of the curtain. And in fact that birth, which had seemed so complete in "The Stones," was dragging on. And it went on dragging on. We can follow the problematic accouchement in the poems. They swing from the apprehensions of a woman or women of sterility and death at one extreme, to joyful maternal celebration of the living and almost-born fetus at the other-with one or two encouraging pronouncements from the oracular fetus itself in between. But evidently much had still to be done. Perhaps something like the writ ing of The Bell Jar had still to be faced and got through. It is not until we come to the poems of September, October, and November of 1961-a full two years after "The Stones"-that the newborn seems to feel the draft of the outer world. And even now the voice of Ariel, still swad dled in the old mannerisms, is hardly more than a whimper. But at least we can see what the new situation is. We see her new self confronting-to begin with-the sea, not just the sea off Finisterre and off Hartland, but the Bay of the Dead, and "nothing, nothing but a great space" which becomes the surgeon's 2 .\.I. ward of mutilations (reminiscent of the hospital city in "The Stones"). She con fronts her own moon-faced sarcophagus, her mirror cloud [95]</page><page sequence="11">GRAND STREET ing over, the moon in its most sinister aspect, and the yews-"blackness and silence." In this group of poems the most chilling pieces she had written up to this time what she confronts is all that she had freed herself from. Throughout the Colossus poems, as we have seen, the fateful part of her being, the part-a large, inclusive com plex-that had formerly been too much for her, had held her, as a matrix, and nursed her back to new life. Death, in this matrix (and in one sense the whole complex, which had tried to kill her and had all but succeeded, came under the sign of death), had a homeopathic effect on the nucleus that survived. But now that she was resurrected, as a self that she could think of as an Eve (as she tried so hard to do in her radio play Three Women), a lover of life and of her children, she still had to deal with everything in her that remained other wise, everything that had held her in the grave for "three days," The Other. And, it was only now, for the first time, at her first step into independent life, that she could see it clearly for what it was-confronting her, separated from her at last, to be contemplated and, if possible, overcome. It is not hard to understand her despondency at this junc ture. Her new Ariel self had evolved for the very purpose of winning this battle, and much as she would have preferred, most likely, to back off and live in some sort of truce, her next step was just as surely inescapable. From her new position of strength, she came to grips quite quickly. After Three Women (which has to be heard, as naive speech, rather than read as a literary artifact) quite suddenly the ghost of her father reappears, for the first time in two and a half years, and meets a daunting, point-blank, demythologized assessment. This is followed by the most precise description she ever gave of The Other-the deathly woman at the heart of everything she now closed in on. After this, her poems arrived at a marvelous brief poise. Three of them together, titled "Crossing the Water," "Among the Narcissi" and "Pheasant," all written within three or four days of one another in early April 1962, are unique in her work. And maybe it was this achievement, inwardly, this cool, light, very beautiful moment of mas tery, that enabled her to take the next step. [96]</page><page sequence="12">TED HUGHES Within a day or two of writing "Pheasant," she started a poem about a giant wych elm that overshadowed the yard of her home. The manuscript of this piece reveals how she began it in her usual fashion, as another poem of the inter lude, maybe a successor to "Pheasant" (the actual pheasant of the poem had flown up into the actual elm) and the cus tomary features began to assemble. But then we see a struggle break out, which continues over several pages, as the lines try to take the law into their own hands. She forced the poem back into order, and even got a strangle hold on it, and seemed to have won, when suddenly it burst all her restraints and she let it go. And at once the Ariel voice emerged in full. From that day on, it never really faltered again. During the next five months she produced ten more poems. The subject matter didn't alarm her. Why should it, when Ariel was doing the very thing it had been created and liberated to do? In each poem, the terror is encountered head on, and the angel is mastered and brought to terms. The energy released by these victories was noticeable. According to the appointed coincidence of such things, after July her outer circum stances intensified her inner battle to the limits. In October, when she and her husband began to live apart, every detail of the antagonist seemed to come into focus, and she started writing at top speed, producing twenty-six quite lengthy poems in that month. In November she pro duced twelve, with another on December 1st, and one more on December 2nd before the flow stopped abruptly. She now began to look for a flat in London. In December she found a maisonette, in a house adorned with a plaque commemorating the fact that Yeats had lived there, near Primrose Hill. She decorated this place, furnished it pret tily, moved in with her children before Christmas, and set about establishing a circle of friends. By this time she knew quite well what she had brought off in October and November. She knew she had written beyond her wildest dreams. And she had overcome, by a stunning display of power, the bogies of her life. Yet her attitude to the poems was detached. "They saved me," she said, and spoke of them as an episode that was past. And indeed it was blazingly clear that she had come through, in [97]</page><page sequence="13">GRAND STREET Lawrence's sense, and that she was triumphant. The impression of growth and new large strength in her person ality was striking. The book lay completed, the poems care fully ordered. And she seemed to be under no compulsion to start writing again. On December 31st she tinkered with a poem that she had drafted in October but had not included in the Ariel canon, and even now she did not bother to finish it-one of the few poems (only two or three in her mature career) that she did not carry through to a finished copy. In January of 1963 what was called the coldest freeze-up in fifteen years affected her health and took toll of her energy. She was in resilient form, however, for the English publication of The Bell Jar on January 23rd. If she felt any qualms at the public release of this supercharged piece of her autobiography, she made no mention of it at the time, either in conversation or in her diary. Reading them now, the reviews seem benign enough, but at the time, like all reviews, they brought exasperation and dismay. But they did not visibly deflate her. Then on January 28th she began to write again. She con sidered these poems a fresh start. She liked the different, cooler inspiration (as she described it) and the denser pat tern, of the first of these, as they took shape. With after knowledge, one certainly looks at something else-though the premonitory note, except maybe in her very last poem, is hardly more insistent than it had seemed in many an ear lier piece. But in that first week of February a number-a perverse number-of varied crises coincided. Some of these have been recounted elsewhere. No doubt all of them combined to give that unknowable element its chance, in her final act, on the early morning of Monday, February 11th. All her poems are in a sense by-products. Her real cre ation was that inner gestation and eventual birth of a new self-conquering self, to which her journal bears witness, and which proved itself so overwhelmingly in the Ariel poems of 1962. If this is the most important task a human being can undertake (and it must surely be one of the most difficult), then this is the importance of her poems, that they provide such an intimate, accurate embodiment of the [98]</page><page sequence="14">TED HUGHES whole process from beginning to end-or almost to the end. That her new self, who could do so much, could not ulti mately save her, is perhaps only to say what has often been learned on this particular field of conflict-that the moment of turning one's back on an enemy who seems safely defeated, and is defeated, is the most dangerous moment of all. And that there can be no guarantees. [99]</page></plain_text>
