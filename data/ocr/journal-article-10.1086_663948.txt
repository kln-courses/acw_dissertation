      <p>In a 1956 interview with critic Selden Rodman, Mark Rothko explained the deeply emotional nature of his large multiform paintings: “I’m <italic>not</italic> an abstractionist… . I’m not interested in relationships of color or form or anything else… . I’m interested only in expressing basic human emotions—tragedy, ecstasy, doom and so on—and the fact that lots of people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures show that I <italic>communicate</italic> those basic human emotions… . The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them. And if you … are moved only by their color relationships, then you miss the point!”<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Decades after Rothko’s assertions about the affective dynamics of painting, emotions and feelings are increasingly recognized as viable sources and subjects of art-historical inquiry. Consider James Elkins’s <italic>Pictures and Tears: A History of People Who Have Cried in Front of Paintings</italic> (2001), which delves into the powerful emotional circumstances of seeing through tears, and Susan Best’s <italic>Visualizing Feeling: Affect and the Feminine Avant-Garde</italic> (2011), which argues for the centrality of emotions in the making and meaning of minimalist and conceptual art.<sup>2</sup> Such studies are prompted by burgeoning contemporary interests in writing “the body” back into art history and theory, in thinking about art “beyond representation,” and in resisting reductivist poststructuralist approaches to power and ideology. Modernist assumptions that insisted on separating thought from feelings—the basic binary of the Cartesian mind/body thesis—are challenged today by new understandings of their synergism. Emotions are “upheavals of thought,” Martha Nussbaum asserts, and our acquisition and understanding of knowledge is embodied, sensate, interested, and invested.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Multiple academic fields have turned to the study of emotions, developing methodologies and interpretative frameworks that consider how feelings like joy, grief, fear, shame, and anger inform particular cultures and societies.<sup>4</sup> Likewise, multidisciplinary theories of affect are widespread, including concepts of the “transmission of affect,” about how feelings flow between individuals and their social and physical environments, and how certain affects mobilize social groups and activate cultural and political modes of production (and vice versa).<sup>5</sup> In this issue of <italic>American Art</italic>, several authors explore how feelings and emotions inform—and are informed by—American visual and material cultures.</p>
      <p>Arousing the neural programs that direct our actions and behaviors, emotions “constitute the primary motivational system for human beings,” argues psychologist Carroll Izard.<sup>6</sup> As such, emotions are central to human perception and cognition: to what grabs our attention, or moves us, and the ways we respond. If recent neurobiological studies suggest that particular human emotions (fear, for example) may be innate, others (such as shame, anger, and grief) are learned. Contextualized by shifting values and concerns, feelings and emotions are varied and dynamic.<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>While the words “feelings,” “emotions,” and “affect” are often used interchangeably, definitions and distinctions are helpful. Emotions are the expressions or projections (or responses) of feelings; emotions are social, whereas feelings are individual, physical sensations. Affect, derived from the Latin <italic>affectus</italic>, meaning “passion” and “disposition of mood,” is the experience of feeling registered at the level of (and in) the body. Or, as the editors of <italic>The Affect Theory Reader</italic> put it: “Affect, at its most anthropomorphic, is the name we give to those forces—visceral forces beneath, alongside, or generally other than conscious knowing, vital forces insisting beyond emotion—that can serve to drive us toward movement, toward thought and extension.” And affect, which Brian Massumi describes as unstructured and unqualified “intensity,” is “central to an understanding of our information- and image-based late-capitalist culture.” He continues: “Fredric Jameson notwithstanding, belief has waned for many, but not affect. If anything, our condition is characterized by a surfeit of it.”<sup>7</sup> Lauren Berlant counsels that grasping the complex sociocultural circulation of this “surfeit” requires our empirical consideration of “what feelings are made out to mean; and which forces, meanings, and practices are magnetized by concepts of affect and emotion.”<sup>8</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Critical wariness is understandable: “feelings” conjure the cheesy mantra of a Hallmark card, and the advertising industry has taken full advantage of what is called “emotion marketing” for decades: from Toyota’s “Oh What a Feeling!” campaign (1970s) and Coca-Cola’s “Can’t Beat the Feeling” (1988), to Subaru’s “Feel the Love” (2009).<sup>9</sup> Still, however manipulative, capitalizing on popular and public response suggests the significance, rather than the triviality, of emotions and prompts questions about what, in fact, generates such response. How and why are we moved—touched, impressed, provoked—by certain works of art? Why are some paintings pleasurable; others—like Rothko’s—so melancholy they make us cry? How do feelings account for the enormous popularity of pictures by an American artist like Norman Rockwell and the moving pictures made by some of his most avid collectors?<fig id="fg2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>“Norman Rockwell’s art is loved in a way that transcends simple analysis of his subjects and style,” Elizabeth Broun observes in <italic>Telling Stories: Norman Rockwell from the Collections of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg</italic>, the catalogue for the 2010 exhibition held at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The “affection people have for his paintings,” she adds, relates to how his “stories have found their ways into our hearts.”<sup>10</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Stories, pictures, movies, and nations are meaningful not just because of their plots and characters and morals but because of their affective dimensions. Benedict Anderson argues that certain symbols, styles, and practices generate “affective bonds of nationalism” that encourage an emotional allegiance to the nation and national ideals that is as strong and sacred as that extended to family, region, religion, and/or ethnic and racial groups.<sup>11</sup> Rockwell often pictured American national ideals, such as free speech and democratic politics, or patriotism and playing to win. As George Lucas remarks, Rockwell’s pictures “symbolized … what America held most dear… . He really captured society’s ambitions and emotions, and, as corny as they are, that’s what America is.”<sup>12</sup> Affection for Rockwell’s pictures relates not only to his technical mastery of a hyperrealist style that intimated authenticity but also to his mastery of the emotional.</p>
      <p>Lucas and Spielberg both acknowledge that Rockwell’s affective nuances drive their interests in his pictures. “He is painting to connect emotionally with an audience, which is what we do in movies,” says Lucas.<sup>13</sup> Audiences, he adds, want movies that are “not only entertaining” but touch “the emotional side of a human being.” “I make movies that way. Steven makes movies that way. A lot of people think it should be a cerebral exercise. We don’t. We believe that it’s an emotional connection between the viewer and the artist.”<sup>14</sup> Spielberg remarks that he had Rockwell’s <italic>Freedom from Fear</italic> (1943) in mind when he directed a scene in <italic>Empire of the Sun</italic> (1987) showing young Jim Graham’s parents tucking him into bed.</p>
      <p>Various styles of American art have inspired various movie directors. In 1948, for example, Abraham Polonsky was shooting the film noir classic <italic>Force of Evil</italic> in various New York locations. A few days into the movie he asked his cinematographer, George Barnes, why the dailies were all so pleasant, so upbeat—this was supposed to be film noir, after all. Barnes replied that this was standard studio style. Polonsky then took him to an exhibition of Edward Hopper’s paintings and prints and said, “This is how I want the picture to look.”<sup>15</sup> Hopper’s use of single-source lighting, isolated human figures, and distorted perspectives captured the look of existential angst, urban despair, and human guilt that Polonsky aimed to project in <italic>Force of Evil</italic>.</p>
      <p>In this regard, style is an emotional resource: a means of stirring certain feelings, of creating mood. Hopper, Rockwell, and contemporary video artist Bill Viola all brilliantly engage the affective nuances of style. In <italic>The Quintet of Remembrance</italic> (2000), Viola referenced Hieronymus Bosch’s late fifteenth-century painting <italic>Christ Mocked</italic>, among other works, to evoke particular emotions from five actors: joy, rapture, anger, fear, and sorrow. The video is sixty seconds of film extended in slow motion to more than sixteen minutes of screening; there is no editing, no plot. Every emotional nuance becomes visible in high-definition format, with digitally intensified colors. Subtle transitions in gesture and facial expression are amplified and accentuated, compelling viewers, entranced by the slow, intimate, and generally quiet ambiance of Viola’s projects, to ask questions such as “What are these people looking at, or thinking about?” and to contemplate how specific events and actions are framed by certain emotional states.</p>
      <p>Rockwell was similarly masterful in illustrating emotional nuance. A <italic>Saturday Evening Post</italic> cover from 1916 captures the feelings of delight and pleasure of children and adults alike watching a Charlie Chaplin movie. A cover from 1948, which consists of fifteen people depicted in groups of two, grapevining gossip from one person to the next, catalogues human emotions from shock and disapproval to insolence, mirth, and anger, which are captured in the pair at bottom right, where the man who is the subject of this emotional chatter—Norman Rockwell himself—yells at the woman who instigated it up in the top left-hand corner of the painting. Rockwell’s wife, Mary, is pictured as the second gossip in the third row.<sup>16</sup>
      </p>
      <p>“[O]ne billion six hundred million persons look at a given [Norman Rockwell] Boy Scout calendar on a given day,” the <italic>New Yorker</italic> reported in 1945. Likewise, in mid-twentieth-century America, Rockwell’s <italic>Saturday Evening Post</italic> covers reached an estimated one in seven Americans through magazine subscriptions alone, and then up to six times more as each issue was passed on in public places like barbershops and doctor’s offices.<sup>17</sup> “I like to please people,” Rockwell told a <italic>Time</italic> magazine writer in 1943, and “pleasure” is the operative word in the many thousands of fan letters he regularly received.<sup>18</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The Norman Rockwell Museum (Stockbridge, Mass.) houses some “thirty cartons packed with letters” (about 20,000 of them), many of which praise Rockwell for the affective dynamics of his art. One female fan wrote in 1939, “You give pleasure to millions like myself who will probably never see a collection of portraits”; another said in 1942, “I’m sure you can’t really know, how much pleasure your illustrations … and pictures … give to thousands of people.” Michele Bogart argues that fans wrote to Rockwell to affirm “the legitimacy of the emotions” that his art evoked and to concur with its “purposefulness and commonality of values and ideals.” As one man told Rockwell in 1959, “Keep up the great contributions to our Way of Life. I can’t think of an artist whose works are so meaningful to common people.” Or as a woman wrote in the mid-1970s, “Your art work, I feel, is a part of Americana, times when people were neighborly, movies were purely entertainment, and the world was a nice and cozy place to live in.”<sup>19</sup>

      <p>Not discounting such hazy nostalgia for this America that never was, fans wrote to Rockwell because his pictures encouraged them to imagine—to feel—the America they most desired. Rockwell’s America was incomplete and expectant, a nation in progress. Typically framed mid-plot, Rockwell’s pictures are always in play, Lucas observes, allowing viewers to determine whether that spiny metal thing will really work (<italic>New Television Antenna</italic>, 1949) or whether the new kids and the old kids on the block will all get along (<italic>Moving In</italic>, 1967).<sup>20</sup> “Fans’ actions and reactions resonated with Rockwell’s characterization of art in a democracy,” Bogart explains. “Collectively, they affirmed the centrality of visual narratives and the emotional needs such stories could fulfill,” especially in a post–World War II art world, where Rockwell’s brand of realism and middlebrow sentimentality were dismissed as kitsch. Recall that in 1939, Clement Greenberg identified “a <italic>Saturday Evening Post</italic> cover by Norman Rockwell” as a dangerous, even demagogic, threat to the avant-garde.<sup>21</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Some argue that Rockwell’s popularity rests on an “easy, untroubled realism,” an art of “unending cliché” that keeps viewers “right in the middle” of their “comfort zone.”<sup>22</sup> True enough, Rockwell’s America was mostly trauma-free: “If there was sadness in this created world of mine,” he remarked, “it was a pleasant sadness. If there were problems, they were humorous problems,” like jumping into a swimming pool (<italic>Boy on High Dive</italic>, 1947) or getting glasses (<italic>Eye Doctor</italic>, 1956).<sup>23</sup> And Rockwell’s art certainly exemplified what Russell Lynes defined as “middlebrow” and Henry Seidel Canby called America’s “bourgeois” style.<sup>24</sup> Rockwell was the visual cohort of popular middle-class writers like Edna Ferber, whose novel <italic>Cimarron</italic> sold five hundred thousand copies in 1929, while Ernest Hemingway’s <italic>A Farewell to Arms</italic>, also published that year, sold a mere thirty-one thousand copies. Rockwell’s pictures paralleled the realist novels that occupied “the very center” of America’s literary landscape and, like them, aimed to give their audiences “pleasure, moral instruction, and social guidance.”<sup>25</sup> Yet if the emotional connection Rockwell labored to produce for his middlebrow viewers was, as they repeatedly told him, pleasurable and pleasant, it was also one of possibilities: less the cliché of America now than an America to come.</p>
      <p>Rockwell and Rothko, with whom this short piece began, both understood art, and painting in particular, as an emotional investment in their own and their audience’s feelings. The essays that follow similarly speculate on the affective dimensions of American art at other times and in other media.</p>
