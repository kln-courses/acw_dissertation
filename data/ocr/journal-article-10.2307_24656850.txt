Princeton, N.J., U.S.A. The The Problem·, Previous Studies: For the rabbis no statement of scripture was haphazard or super fluous. They taught that even the two Hebrew words for God— ElohimElohim and YHWH—were not synonymns but symbolized the dif ferent aspects of God's providence. Wherever the tetragrammaton appeared, God should be viewed as acting mercifully: where Elohim appeared, God's judgment should be understood 1). Between them, the two names expressed the totality of God's providence or, as they expressed it, His two Middoth or measures. Philo also interpreted the names of God as emblems for His ways of dealing with mankind. Yet Philo taught the reverse of the rabbis. For him, theos (the equivalent of Elohim in LXX Greek) represented the beneficent, gracious and creative power of God while kjrios (the equivalent of the tetragrammaton in LXX Greek) stood for the royal, ruling or punishing power 2). He used the Greek word djnamisdjnamis or "power" to describe these aspects of God. Zacharias Fraenkel explained the contradiction between rabbinic and Philonic schemes by asserting that Philo's knowledge of Hebrew was evidently too superficial to apply the doctrine correctly, even though he must have had some familiarity with Palestinian midrash 3). Due to the association of kjrios with governmental authority in *) See e. g. Rashi on Gen. 1:1 based on Sifre Dt. 27, Gen. R. 33 (ed. Theodor p. 308) ibid. 73 (p. 847); M. Ps. 56:3 (ed.

SEGAL 2 Greek, he reversed the midrashic scheme so that kjrios signified sovereignty or justice while theos became the emblem for creative and beneficent action. Fraenkel's explanation has been accepted by many scholars in more or less modified form 4). A major challenge to this consensus was outlined by A. Marmor stein in The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God and later in an article in the Jewish Jewish Quarterly Review 5). He maintained that the surviving rabbinic teaching was not the basic doctrine but was the result of a compli cated development. The technical terms middath ha-din and middath ha-rahamimha-rahamimha-rahamim were first attested in the sayings of third generation tan naim (R. Meir and R. Simeon b. Yohai). The earliest terms were middath middath ha-tob and middath ha-puranuth, which are found in some tannaitic documents and closely parallel Philonic terminology. He suggested that the surviving rabbinic doctrine had been deli berately altered from an earlier one for polemical and apologetic reasons. He even tried to prove that relics of the earlier correlation of divine names could be found in some tannaitic sources. Some scholars have accepted Marmorstein's theory, but the majority have remained unconvinced 6). What seemed to be Marmor 4) See L. Cohn, Die Werke Philo von Alexandria 2, p. 19 £; G. F.

But, in general, the suggestion that Philo and not the rabbis witnessed the earliest midrashic traditions has met with considerable resistance. Louis Finkelstein was representative of the opposition when he said, "... his colleagues will hardly be willing to accept on the basis of an isolated, doubtful passage, a theory that runs counter to a dozen well-authenticated rabbinic sources".

The general rejection of Marmorstein's suggestion is well expressed by R. J. Zwi Werblowsky in his prolegomenon to the recent Ktav edition of Marmorstein's major works: There seems to be little proof of this thesis and Philo, whose inter pretations are frequently the result of his peculiar exegetical contraints, is certainly no convincing witness—in the absence of other supporting evidence—of the existence of Jewish "traditions" 8). But even if Marmorstein's proofs were not conclusive, he may have been led by correct intuition. His hypothesis should at least be reconsidered. In this paper, we shall first discuss the Philonic evidence, paying special attention to points of contact with rabbinic midrash. Next we shall re-examine Marmorstein's arguments from rabbinic sources. Then we shall draw our own conclusions. Philo'sPhilo's Use of Traditions Several preliminary considerations may predispose us toward Marmorstein's theory. Since the earliest rabbinic evidence is about a century later than Philo, chronology is clearly in favor of Marmor stein. The intervening period was ample time for considerable development in Palestinian traditions while the discussions at the Palestinian academies may provide a setting for the formulation of what became standard rabbinic doctrine. In order to explain the Philonic system as due to poor information or conscious alteration of rabbinic doctrine one has to adopt the precarious position that the rabbinic doctrine existed a hundred years before its earliest attestation. Furthermore, the theory that Philo's version of the correlation of divine names and attributes is due to his imperfect knowledge of Hebrew or the aggada simply does not work. Philo's doctrine of the "two powers" is not an example of his "peculiar exegetical con straints" but presupposed by him as a generally recognized, exegeti cal device. Indeed, Philo's attempt to combine the "two powers" doctrine with his doctrine of the logos causes a great deal of compli cation 9). י) See below for a detailed discussion of Marmorstein's evidence. 8) Zwi Werblowsky's Prolegomenon to the reprint of The Old Rabbinic Doc trine trine of God, (New York 1968), p. xii. 9) For Philo's explanations of the two powers or potencies of God, see Vit. Mos. II, 99; Plant. 86, Migr. 182, etc. The two powers can be associated with the names of God, as discussed above. However, the names of God can also</page><page sequence="4">Ν. Α. DAHL AND ALAN F. SEGAL 4 It should be noted that Philo uses a number of designations for the "powers." Some of these are based upon Greek etymology for the names of God. For instance, the identification of theos with djnamisdjnamisdjnamis poietike is not only due to the use of theos in the story of creation in Gen. 1, but also to an association of theos and tithenai (= poieiti). Conversely, kjrios suggests sovereignty (arche, hegemonia, autexousia,autexousia, etc.) 10). These discussions depend on Greek etymologies, as several scholars have pointed out. But Philo also speaks about the "power of goodness" (djnamis agathotetos, hileos, euergesias) as opposed to the punishing power (djnamis kolasterios). Thus, the least Hellenized terminology of Philo corresponds almost exactly to the oldest rabbinic terms, middath ha-tob and middath ha-puranuth, with the difference that the rabbis speak about the "measures" by which God metes out His goodness and His punishment, rather than His "powers" 11). The specific terminology of "two powers", which Philo used frequently, became offensive to the rabbis, for reasons that will become apparent. Had Philo sufficient cause for alarm, he might symbolize God and His Logos. Occasionally, this causes some ambiguity, as can be seen in Opif. 20-21, Conf. Ling. 137. In some passages Philo differentiates between several entities, the logos, the creative and the royal powers, the legis lative and the punitive powers. See Q. Ex. II, 62 f and De Fuga 100 f. A special tradition in Q. Ex. I, 23 opposes a destructive (phthoropoios) and a saving bene ficent power in man as well as in the world. See Philo Supplement II, p. 32 in the notes. See also E. Kamlah, Die Form der katalogiscben Paraenese im Neuen Testament Testament (Tuebingen 1964), p. 50-53. In Q. Gen. II, 16, the contrasting pair, dynamisdynamis diaphtheirousa and euergetes, is linked to the divine names. 10) The etymology of theos can be traced back to Herodotus II, 52. Cf. L. Cohn, Die Die Werke Philons, I, p. 19 f.; e.g. Vit. Mosis II, 99; Q. Ex. II, 62. u) Marmorstein seems to us and to most scholars to have adequately shown that the terms middath ha-tob and middath ha-puranuth were frequently used in the early midrashim rather than the later terms, middath ha-din and middath ha-rahamim. However it is also possible, as Philo shows, that same person used several terms. See the recent work of Andreas Nissen, Gott und der Naechste im antiken Judentum (Tuebingen 1974), esp. 104 f. He tries to show that the rabbinic vocabularies have specific and different meanings and therefore are never equated. But he systematizes rabbinic thought too severely. It is hard to demonstrate that middah ever completely loses its connotation of "measuring out" by God to become a "quality" (Eigenschaft) in a philosophical sense. Secondly, it is not true, as he supposes, that the older terminology is never linked with the names of God. See e.g., Tos. Ber. 7:1, b Ber. 48b. Nissen seems to be too little aware of the criticisms of Sjoberg that Ljungmann has brought p. 115-6 (p. 167-8 in English summary). Furthermore, he is not sufficiently historical in his development and would have benefitted from Urbach's discussion, even leaving aside the issue of the reliability of attributions to early rabbis, which Urbacii ignores.</page><page sequence="5">5 PHILOPHILO AND THE RABBIS ON THE NAMES OF GOD easily have employed the term "measures" as well. In fact, he can occasionally interpret the word "measures" in the biblical text as an allegorical reference to the powers of God. Furthermore, both Philo and the rabbis can understand references to God's "two hands" as symbols of His merciful or punishing action. Thus, there is suf ficient similarity of terminology and exegesis to prove what few have denied, that the Philonic and the rabbinic interpretations of the names of God are not independent parallels but variants of one and the same tradition 12). The variability of Philo's terminology shows that he drew on various exegetical traditions current in his Alexandrian environment in writing his commentaries 13). Some interpretations represent attempts to derive Greek physics and philosophy from the Bible. Others are more akin to midrashic interpretation and may even ultimately have been based upon the Hebrew text 14). For our pur poses, the treatise on "The Immutability of God" contains the most interesting examples of this. Philo uses the flood as one of the classic examples of God's employment of His attributes of mercy and judg ment, just as the rabbis do 15). The Hebrew text has the tetragrammaton in Gen. 6:3, 5-8, where the Greek text used by Philo had either kyrios ho theos or simply ho theos.theos. At this point the Hebrew, rather than the Greek text, would favor the Philonic notion that "Lord" designates the punishing power. In his running expositions of the Flood story, Philo does not comment upon the divine names until he comes to Gen. 6:8, but in another context he makes a comment that seems to presuppose that the tetragrammaton was used in Gen. 6:3-7: "He had set up His kingly and sovereign power, which is called Lord, when He brought 12) On the "three measures" in Gen. 18:6, see Sacr. 59; Q. Gen. IV 8. On the "hands" of God, cf. Immut. 73, Somn. II, 265, and Plant. 50. On the "ways" of God, see Somn. I, 237 and Sifre Dt. 49 (on Dt. 11:12.) In view of the various points of contact, it is hard to accept Nissen's statement on p. 448 that the midras hie and Philonic traditions are completely unrelated. See also pages 8 and 11 f below. 13) See Vit. Mos. beginning. 14) W. Bousset tried to isolate the Hellenistic sources in his Juedisch-christlicher SchulbetriebSchulbetriebSchulbetrieb in Alexandrien und Rom\ Literarische Untersuchungen Philo und Clemens von von Alexandria, Justin, und Irenaeus (Goettingen 1915). For traditions based upon the Hebrew text, cf. literature in note 4. S. Belkin, op. cit., has made some in teresting observations but overstresses the similarities, assuming that Philo had a direct knowledge of Palestinian aggada. 15) Other paradigms are the tower of Babel, the destruction of Sodom, the Exodus, cf. e.g., Abr. 145, Plant. 86, Conf. Ling. 137.</page><page sequence="6">Ν. Α. DAHL AND ALAN F. SEGAL 6 down judgment in the form of water" 1e). In any case, the Hebrew text must have been the ultimate basis for the opinion of exegetes against whom Philo polemicizes. They thought that Gen. 6:6 indi cated that God had repented or changed his mind. Unaware of the Hebrew text, Philo refutes them by showing that the Greek text did not attribute any change of mind to God 17). Philo's arguments against the idea that God might repent are to a large extent derived from the philosophical concept of God as immovable and unchangeable. But he also stresses the simpler and more biblical idea that God does not vacillate, as men do, but holds fast to what he has purposed without any alteration. The classical biblical statement to this effect is Num. 23:19, "God is not man, that He should lie, or a son of man that He should repent" etc. Philo discusses this text and the contrasting phrase "as a man disciplines his son" (Dt. 8:5) at some length in his exposition of Gen. 6:7 18). But already his comments upon Gen. 6:6 seem to draw upon para phrase of Num. 23:19 19). Philo regards the passages in Num. 23:19 and Dt. 8:5, which he often quotes in an abbreviated form, "not as a man" and "as a a man", to be the two "supreme summaries" (anotata kephalaid) of the laws. He discusses them in several contexts but most extensi vely in "The Immutability of God". It is hardly too bold to con jecture that he draws upon an exegetical tradition which discussed the apparent contradiction between Gen. 6:6-7 and Num. 23:19 in the Hebrew text: "The LORD was sorry (wayyinahem YHWH) That He had made man" and "God is not a man . . . that he should repent {weyitneham)". Philo uses the two "supreme summaries" to deal with the anthro pomorphic and anthropopathic language of the Bible. "That God is not like a man", states the truth that He is transcendent and un 16) Q.

Gen. R. 27.</page><page sequence="7">7 PHILOPHILO AND THE RABBIS ON THE NAMES OF GOD changeable. When Moses presented God "as a man," it was for peda gogical reasons, in order to instruct all members of the nation, even those who were not capable of grasping the pure truth. But besides this hermeneutical application of the summaries, Philo has also retained an understanding of them that takes more account of the context in Num. 23:19 and Dt. 8:5: God is not like a man, because He does not change His mind but does what He has purposed. Yet, He is like a man who uses threats and punishments in order to dis cipline and chastise his son 20). The latter heading therefore includes God's wrath and use of weapons against his enemies. Philo gives a list of God's weapons. It is mainly based upon Dt. 32:22-25, 41-42, but the inclusion of "winds and destructive fire" alludes to the wind that made Pharaoh and his army drown at the Sea and to the destruc tion of Sodom by fire 21). The transfer of features from Exodus 15 to the Flood story is even more obvious when Philo speaks about God "stretching forth His saving right hand", whereby "saving mercy" (toward Noah) was mixed with the judgment against the sinners 22). Philo's philosophical doctrine of "the Immutability of God" has, apparently, been superimposed upon an exegetical tradition which stressed that the punishment of the sinners, in the Flood as at the Sea, does not mitigate the constancy of God's saving purpose. The rescue of Noah, and of the Israelites at the Sea, would illustrate the principle stated in Num. 23:19, that God is not like a man who changes his mind. At the same time, He is represented as a man who uses weapons against His enemies. The best support and probably the source for this imagery is not Dt. 8:5 but the Hebrew text of Ex. 15:3: YHWH ish ?nilhamah. The Greek text of Ex. 15:3 avoids this glaring anthropomorphism by translating: kyrios siintribon polemous.polemous. In this form Ex. 15:3 could not support the idea that the Lord, as a warrior, uses weapons against His enemies. Instead Philo 20) The shift of emphasis is possible because the verb paideuein can mean to educate (in the sense of Greek Paideia) but also to discipline or chastise (like ysr).ysr). The traditional understanding of Dt. 8:5 as referring to God's chastising punishments has been preserved with the least amount of alteration in QG 11.54, but see also Deus Imm. 63-64, 67-68. 21) Deus Imm. 60 and 68, cf. Ex. 15:8, 10; Gen. 19:24. For God "as a man" using weapons, see also Somn. I 235-236. In Mekhilta, Shirta 4 on Ex. 15:3 (L. II, 30; H-R, p. 129) a list of God's weapons is given in the form of a catena of scriptural passages: II Sam. 12:15 f., Hab. 3:9-11, etc. 22) Deus Imm. 73-74, cf. Ex. 15:6, 12 and the comments in the Mekhilta, Shirta 5 and 9 (L ii, 39-41, 67-68; H.-R., p. 133, 145).</page><page sequence="8">Ν. Α. DAHL AND ALAN F. SEGAL 8 takes Dt. 8:5 to prove that Moses represented God as a man for pedagogical reasons. Even so, Philo has retained traces of the idea that God acts as a man when he fights His enemies and inflicts punish ment upon sinners 23). On the other hand, later variations of what may be pre-Philonic tradition occur in rabbinic interpretation of Ex.Ex. 15:3 24). Philo takes the second of the two "supreme summaries," i.e. "as a man", to be the heading for all commands and prohibitions that refer to God's wrath and punishment. The distinction between the two summaries is, therefore, to some extent equivalent to the dis tinction between the beneficent or creative and the punishing or ruling powers. The overlapping is most obvious in that Philo relates the attitudes of fear and love to the two summaries (Num. 23:19 and Dt. 8:5) as well as to the "two powers" which are symbolized by kjrios and theos 25). At this point the similarity with rabbinic doctrine is especially striking. There is, at the same time, an impor tant difference. From passages like Dt. 10:12 f. (cf. 6:5, 13). Philo draws the lesson that men should love God as a benefactor but at 23) In Deus Imm. 53-54 Philo first states that the two supreme summaries of the laws are "God is not as a man" and "as a man". Afterwards he quotes Dt. 8:5 as if it were a third passage that resolves the apparent contradiction between the two summaries or "chapters" of the laws. This could be explained on the hypothesis that Philo draws upon a source in which "as a man" alluded to Ex. 15:3 rather than to Dt. 8:5. We owe this suggestion to a seminar paper by Jouette Bassler. 24) Thus, both Philo and the rabbis discuss how God can be represented as a man when He fills the universe, see Deus Imm. 57, Conf. Ling. 134-139 and Mekhilta, Shirta 4 (L. II, 34, h-R, p. 131). The Mekhilta passage contrasts Ex. 15:3 with Jer. 23:24, Isa. 6:3, Ez. 43:2. The solution is provided by Hosea 11:9, understood as: "Indeed, I am God, but am I, the Holy One, not also a man in the midst of thee?" i.e. "My name I sanctify in your midst". Cf. J. Goldin, The The Song at the Sea, (New Haven 1971), p. 133 f. On God as "man" in rabbinic texts see also Marmorstein, The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God, I, p. 64-67 and II, p. 7-9. 25) Fear and love are related to the "headings" of Num. 23:19 and Dt. 8:5, in Immut. 69; cf. Somn. I, 232, 237, Plant. 85-92. In QG I, 55 to hekousion circum scribes the attitude of loving God and honoring him for His own sake. The latter expression, which also occurs in Immut. 69, is similar to the rabbinic idea that those who love God do His will "for the sake of Heaven". See e.g. Aboth 2:2, 12 and Siphre Dt. 41 on 11:13 and 48 on 11:22. The best treatment of the rabbinic discussion of fear and love is still A. Buechler, Studies in Sin and Atone mentment in the Rabbinic Literature of the First Centuries (London 1928), p. 119-211. r. Sander, is inclined to think that Philo and the Rabbis were independent of one another, but leaves the question open. Furcht und Liebe im palaestinischen fudenthum (Stuttgart 1935), p. 132 note 4. A. Nissen, Gott und der Nachste, p. 448 (cf. p. 205-217, p. 446-465) denies any connection.</page><page sequence="9">9 PHILOPHILO AND THE RABBIS ON THE NAMES OF GOD least fear Him as Lord and Ruler 26). The tannaim stressed the more profound view that God is to be loved even when he chastises by means of the tniddath ha-din. It may well have been the experience of persecution which led to the new emphasis, that God is to be loved, whatever "measure" he metes out 27). But this idea is not completely alien to Philo either: "When things go well, you will not become haughty, because of the supremacy of the king's majesty; and when you have to endure what you do not like, you will not lose hope for something better, because of the tenderness of the great and generous God" 28). In general, both Philo and the rabbis see fear and love as two complementary attitudes for man's proper relationship with God. Goodness and punishment or mercy and judgment correspond as God's complementary ways of dealing with man 29). In "The Immutability of God" 74-75 Philo, commenting upon Gen. 6:8, emphasizes that mercy and judgment are inseparable as pects of God's action, without hypostasizing the qualities as separate powers. The passage is a digression devoted to the interpretation of three Psalm quotations and introduced by the comment that Noah "found grace (Gen. 6:8)", so that "the saving mercy should be mixed with judgment against sinners". In Philo's interpretation, however, only the first quotation bears upon this theme: "Of mercy and judg ment I will sing unto Thee" 30). The second quotation in the catena is Ps. 74:9 (LXX 75:9): "A cup is in the hand of the Lord, filled with a mixture of unmixed wine". The apparently self-contradictory expression oinou akratou, pleres kerasmatos is explained by a discussion of the "unmixed" nature of God, whose powers become "mixed" in the world—like beams of the sun 31). In Philo's source, however, even the quotation from Ps. 74 (75) :9 must have illustrated the mixture of mercy and judgment, since Philo himself uses the "mix ture" metaphor in this sense in Deus Imm. 74 and 76. It is hardly accidental that this metaphor harmonizes with the preceding verse of 26) E.g. Spec. Leg. 299f, Cher. 27-29, Plant. 90, Mut. Nom. 23 f., Somn. I 163, 173. 27) E.g. M.

Nom. 15-24. jSota 5, 20c (= Ber. 9, 14b), and MRSbY on Ex. 20:6. For the purposes of this paper it is not necessary to discuss ideas that are peculiar to Philo, who sometimes relates fear and love to "the powers" and not to God himself, e.g. Decal. 177. 30) Ps. 100:1, LXX 101:1. Deus Imm. 74-75. 31) Deus Imm. 77-81.</page><page sequence="10">Ν. Α. DAHL AND ALAN F. SEGAL 10 the psalm: "God is the judge. He humiliates the one and elevates the other". (Ps. 74:8; LXX 75:8). The third psalm quotation is taken from Ps. 62:11 (LXX: 61:13) "Once the Lord spoke, I have heard these two things". Here too Philo gives a philosophical interpretation, stating that God's word is unmixed and monadic, while human hearing is mixed and dyadic. But the original point was probably that what is heard as two things is actually a unity because the one God is both mighty and merciful, as the following verse of the psalm makes clear. "That the power belongs to God and Thine, Ο Lord, is the mercy". (Ps. 62:llb-12a, LXX: 61:13a)32). Since Philo's own exegetical efforts are almost completely devoted to the Pentateuch, the psalm catena is a priori likely to represent a tradition which he has taken over from elsewhere. Our attempt to distinguish between the original meaning of the catena and the philo sophical accretions added by Philo succeeds in a surprisingly easy way. The original point of all three quotations must have been the "mixture" of mercy and judgment, for which the story of Noah provided the paradigm. All three psalms contain statements that run contrary to the Philonic system of correlation between divine names and attributes. In Ps. 61:11 (62:13), kratos is ascribed to theos and eleoseleos to kyrios·, In Ps. 100 (101):1 both eleos and krisis are ascribed to kjrios;kjrios; And in Ps. 74 (75) :8 it is said that theos krites esti. Thus, the idea of "mixture" provides a solution to an apparent exegetical problem. Philo's philosophical interpretation of the last two quota tions has obscured the original reason for the concatenation of the psalm passages—the paradoxical association of divine attributes and names. Yet Philo has retained the main point, which is stated clearly in his comment upon Ps. 100 (101) :1: "He does not only show mercy when He judges but also judges when He shows mercy" 33). Philo makes the same point elsewhere: "When God is good, the glory of His sovereignty is manifested. When He rules, His goodness appears" 34). These latter statements of Philo represent the final opinion of the rabbis as well. For them the two measures form a pair related as correlatives, not contrasts 35). In fact, it is only thus that any connec 32) Deus Imm. 82-84. 33) Deus Imm. 76. Cf. Q. Ex. II, 66 on the joining of the two powers. 34) Cher. 29. 35) Even the rabbis use the "mixture" metaphor. See e.g., Gen. R. 12:15 On Gen. 2:4 and Ljungmann, p. 78 f. Other aspects of these traditions are common to both Philo and the rabbis, see note 12. Both Philo and the rabbis</page><page sequence="11">PHILO AND THE RABBIS ON THE NAMES OF GOD 11 tion between divine names and attributes can work 36). The Bible does not evince a clear-cut pattern of the use of divine names. Thus there are a number of apparent inconsistencies in either system. These are explained by both Philo and the rabbis in a similar way. Their mutual conclusion is so fundamental that it seems to have been the point of each's exegesis—namely, God must be merciful when He judges and just when He shows mercy. So, both according to the rabbis and according to Philo, the double name, YHWH ElohimElohim or kyrios ho theos, pointed to the one God who is a righteous judge, but also merciful and gracious (cf. Ex. 20:5 f., 34:6 f.). The differences between the Philonic and the rabbinic system should not make us overlook their common core. It is now time to draw some conclusions from our observations on Philo. (1) The Philonic correlation of divine names and attributes is not due to Philo's imperfect knowledge of the aggada or to "his peculiar exegetical constraint". It is likely to have been known both to Hellenized and to more traditional exegetes in Alexandria. (2) The contrasting correlation of names and attributes is not an isolated phenomenon. It is part of the themes and texts that relate to God's goodness and punishment or mercy and judgment. Though there is a a vast difference between Philo's exegesis and rabbinic midrash, there are also several striking similarities, especially where Philo draws upon traditions which do not hypostatize the "beneficent" and "ruling" power. (3) The contradiction between the Philonic and the rabbinic "system" of relating God's attributes to his names is less important than it may seem to be. Both "systems" make it possible to see the mixture of mercy and justice as fundamental to the relationship between man and God. (4) Marmorstein's critics were wrong in their explanation of the Philonic evidence. But it does not necessarily follow that Marmorstein was right. The history of tradition may have been more complicated than either he or his critics assumed. Rabbinic Rabbinic Evidence Under these circumstances, there is good reason to take a new look at the arguments which Marmorstein presented in favor of believed that mercy is greater than justice.

SEGAL 12 the Philonic identification of mercy and justice in the rabbinic material. If Philo's correlation of the names and attributes of God was current in his Alexandrian environment, the rabbinic system may be a later reversal. If the rabbinic evidence turns out to warrant such a conclu sion, we must attempt to reconstruct a plausible history of the tra dition. We must look carefully at Marmorstein's evidence to dis cover more information about the function and setting of the tra ditions of God's attributes in a non-philosophical framework. Several of Marmorstein's arguments have been severely criticized. Erik Sjoberg's summary of the arguments against Marmorstein's hypothesis may be taken as characteristic of the opposition 37). From his criticisms we learn that some of Marmorstein's arguments are definitely erroneous. For instance, the terms, middath ha-din and middathmiddath ha-rahamim are ostensibly older than R. Meir, since they are used by Jose Hagelili 38). Another, more serious qualification of Marmorstein's arguments may be found in the Mekhilta Shirta 3 (on Ex. 15:2). At Ex. 15:2, Marmorstein disallowed a variant reading accepted by most critics which now, with more critical texts, seems warranted. אלי, עמי נהג במדת רחמים ועם אבותי נהג במדת הדין ומנין שאין אלי אלא מדת רחמים שנא׳ אלי אלי למה עזבתני (תהלים כב ב) ואומר אל נא רפה נא לה (במדבר יב יג) ואו׳ אל ה׳ ויאר לנו (תהלים קיח כז): (39 The text depends on the whole of Exodus 15:2 which states: "He is my God and I will exalt Him". According to the critical editions, the midrash equates eli with middath ha-rahamim and elohe abi with middath ha-din.ha-din. However, the received text has middath ha-rahamim twice, hence equating middath ha-rahamim with elohe abi. Marmorstein felt that the early commentators all erred by assuming the later doctrine where Elohim must correspond to the aspect of justice. By disallowing the commentators' correction he was able to show 37) See Erik Sjoberg, p. 11-16. 38) San. 38b; Gen. R. 26:6. Marmorstein also wanted to maintain that the received rabbinic doctrine could not have been known to the rabbi who wrote Ex. R. 5:22. (See "Philo and the Names of God", p. 298.) Although some of the possible implications of this midrash may contradict the received doctrine, there is nothing in the midrash to cause us to conclude that it preceded. The whole question of the reliability of rabbinic attributions was not discussed by Marmor stein. Though he accepted the attributions implicitly when contemporary scholars would not, our arguments remain unaffected by form-critical consider ations since form criticism only serves to date the traditions later. 39) Mekhilta to Ex. 15:2 (44b) Hor. p. 128.</page><page sequence="13">13 PHILO AND THE RABBIS ON THE NAMES OF GOD that the earliest rabbinic tradition was similar to the Philonic formula. However, since Marmorstein's time, critical editions of the Mekh ilta have appeared, all of which assume that the best reading, on the basis of all available evidence, is the text above. The original text equates eli with the attribute of mercy but that is not the same as equating Elohim with it. Marmorstein's hypothesis also depended on a revaluation of the date of the well-attested relationship between Elohim and "judges" in rabbinic literature. Marmorstein suggested that the identification of Elohim with "judges" was a late, second century phenomenon, following the change to the standard rabbinic doctrine of God's attributes 40). This opinion was based on a text in the Mekhilta where Ishmael and Akiba argue over the meaning of Elohim in Ex. 22:27 (You shall not curse Elohim.) If the name were sacred, the referent would be God; if profane, the referent would be "judges". אלוהים לא תקלל. למה נאמר ,לפי שהוא אומר ונוקב שם ה׳ מות יומת (ויקרא כד, טז) עונש שמענו, אזהרה לא שמענו, לכך נאמר, אלוהים לא תקלל, מכל מקום, דברי רבי עקיבא, ר׳ ישמעאל אומר בדיינים הכתוב מדבר, שנאמר עד האלוהים יבא דבר שניהם(». Only Ishmael maintained that the occurrence of Elohim is profane, therefore referring to judges. Marmorstein concluded that Akiba, who opposed Ishmael, did not know the rabbinic tradition that Elohim Elohim could be understood as judges. However, this was a mis apprehension. The issue is not just the meaning of the term but the scriptural grounding of law. Akiba said: "mekol maqom"—"in any case". A warning against cursing both God and the judges was meant by the scripture. Akiba did not deny that Elohim can mean judges; he merely said that the scriptural warning against cursing either God or judges is derived from this place 42). Therefore, the change in terminology, if one occurred, is more likely to have pre dated Akiba's argument than succeeded it. On purely logical grounds, it is not clear how these traditions became relevant to the issue of God's attributes. We have been dis cussing the relationship between the names of God and divine attri 40) Marmorstein, The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God, p. 44. 41) Mekhilta Kaspa 19, H-R p. 317. See also b. San. 66a, p. San 7:8, Soferim 4:5. 42) It is possible that a later tradition asserting that Ishmael and Akiba argued over the meaning of the term "Elohim" (San. 66a etc.) derives from this earlier passage where they do not necessarily argue over the meaning of "E/ohim" at all.</page><page sequence="14">Ν. Α. DAHL AND ALAN F. SEGAL 14 butes of mercy and justice, while the midrash above reports an argu ment between two famous rabbis over whether Elohim refers to both God and earthly judges in a particular place in scripture. The direct connection between the attributes and this verse is based on a single midrash in the Sifre to Deuteronomy 43). In that place YHWH is equated with the attribute of mercy, using Ex. 34:5 and 6 as a proof text. Elohim is equated with the attribute of justice on the basis of Ex. 22:5 and 27, the same passage over which Ishmael and Akiba argue. Ex. 34:5-6 is a very apt place to derive the doctrine of the mercy of YHWH. The midrash is clearly dependent on an exegesis of Ex. 34. But the other proof-text may more easily be seen as a secondary elaboration of the midrash, dependent on the previous discussion between Akiba and Ishmael. When the two midrashic questions (the correspondance between the attributes and the names of God; the meaning of Elohim) were brought together is not clear. It may have been relatively soon after the time of Ishmael and Akiba since the Sifre is widely believed to contain tannaitic material. It is more likely to have developed much later. However, if one assumes the reliability of the tradition as Marmorstein did, any change in the rabbinic terminology would have had to develop earlier than the middle of the second century, as Marmorstein dated it, for it would have had to occur earlier than Ishmael and Akiba. Marmor stein has suggested one possible date for the change from the antique terminology of middath ha-tob and middath ha-puranuth to the received terminology of middath ha-din and middath ha-rahamim. He has probably discovered when the received terminology came into frequent use, but he has not adequately demonstrated that a "Philonic" system of identification of divine names and attributes was in use in the rabbinic community. Other of Marmorstein's arguments still remain possible because his critics' objections to them can be partially removed. Sjoberg, again representative of the criticism, objected to two of Marmor stein's examples of the Philonic doctrine in rabbinic literature. The first is based on the statement: ant YHWH. Sjoberg stated that the use of the tetragrammaton in these cases was taken by the rabbis to imply a double oath—a pledge of justification to the righteous and a warning of punishment to the iniquitous. According to Sjo berg then, it does not qualify as an example of the Philonic system. 43) Sifre Dt. 26. on Dt. 3:24 "wethhannan el YHWH" (Finkelstein, p. 41).</page><page sequence="15">15 PHILOPHILO AND THE RABBIS ON THE NAMES OF GOD אני ה׳מהשאיאיפשר לבשר ודם לומר כן אני ה, בשבועה אני יפרע מהם והלא דברים קל וחומר. ומה מדת פורענות מעוטה אמר הקב״ה לעשר ועשה מדת טובה מרובה על אחת כמה וכמה (». SjobergSjoberg maintained that this example is already a well-known exception to the general rule 45). It is certainly true that the rabbis often mention that am YHWH is a statement of God's oath. The observation is ascribed to R. Hanina, the younger contemporary of Yohanan b. Zakkai. But it is not clear that such cases were meant to be conscious exceptions to the rabbinic doctrine of God's two measures. The tannaitic occurence of the tradition in the Mekhilta states plainly that the oath formula signifies divine punishment for transgressors and uses the more ancient vocabulary of "puranuth'n for the attribute of justice. It does not derive anything else from the names of God. Instead, it says that God's promises to do good would a a fortiori be greater. It does not state that when YHWH occurs in an oath it is exempted from agreement with other doctrines. No doubt, it eventually was seen as an exception to the received rabbinic doctrine or it would either have been specially discussed or omitted. But the "oath formula" cannot be assumed to be an antique exemp tion to the doctrine of God's attributes. The interpretation of the expression "the hand of YHWH" provides a similar case 46). It is the jad YHWH, not the tetragramma ton, which is taken to imply a stroke (makkeh), and therefore equated with the middath ha-din. But once again, it is still possible to see this as a fragment influenced by an older "Philonic" usage which could be retained because it did not flatly contradict the later, standardized doctrine. Sjoberg also argued against Marmorstein's use of rabbinic interpretations of Lev. 18:4. תני ר׳ חייא אני ה׳ אלוהיכם שני פעמים, אני הוא שפרעתי מדור המבול ומאנשי סדום ועמורה ומצרים ואני עתיד ליפרע ממי שעושה כמעשיהם: &lt;ל4 Sjoberg maintained that since both the tetragrammaton and Elohim are present, the basis of the exegesis is unclear. Furthermore, he argued that this exegesis is the standard rabbinic interpretation of this particular phrase in scripture, citing Sifre Zuta to Nu. 15:41 as another example of the doctrine 48). 44) Mekhilta Pisha 7 (Bo, H-R p. 24); see also Lev.

Hiyya's remarks 49) cannot be based on the two names of God but on the repetition of the divine name in Lev. 18:4 and again in Lev. 18:5. Since only the tetragrammaton is repeated in both verses, we must conclude that he was making a statement disconsonant with the standard rabbinic doctrine of God's attributes 50). These limited cases allow Marmorstein's hypothesis as a possi bility. But they are not enough to prove his hypothesis or to clarify the history of the tradition. If, however, there were another, unrelated and separate parallel to the Philonic scheme in the rabbinic evidence, the possibility of Philo's attesting ancient midrashic evidence would grow stronger. Like the "oath form" and the "yad YHWH" cases, it would have to be a reference which would not obviously contra diet the later, standard rabbinic remarks or it would have been eliminated. Such an occurence can be found in the Mekhilta again: מכילתא דרבי ישמעאל בחודש ה, שירתא ד מכילתא דרבי שמעון בן יוחאי בשלח ט׳יו עמי 81 אנכי ה׳ אלוהיך למה נאמר לפי שנגלה על הים כגבור עושה מלחמות 1 שני ה, איש מלחמה נגלה על הר סיני כזקן מלא רחמים שני ויראו את אלוהי ישראל וכשנגאלו מה הוא אומר כעצם השמים לטוהר ואומר חזא הוית עד די כרסוון רמיו 2 ואומר נהר דינור 3 נגד ונפק מן קדמוהי וגר שלא ליתן פתחון פה לאומות העמים לומר שתי רשויות הן' אלא אנוכי ה׳ אלוהיך אדבמצרים אד על הים הים אני בסיני אני לשעבר אני לעתיד לבא ד״א ה׳ איש מלחמה הי שמו לפי שנגלה הקב״ה על הים) נראה להם כבחור עושה מלחמה ה׳ שמו נגלה (ה׳ עליהם בסיני) כזקן מלא רחמים חזא הוית וגו׳ שלא ליתן פתחון פה לומר שתי רשויות טש בשמים אלא ה׳ איש מלחמה (ד״א) ה׳ נלחם במצרים ה׳ שמו הוא (נלחם על) הים והוא על הירדן והוא על נחלי ארנון 49) R.

H-R Shirta excludes it as secondary. Both agree that the pericope ends here. The additional words occur only in Bahodesh, which also contains the sermon of R. Nathan. Here we see a description of the merciful aspect of God present at Sinai when the divine name Elohim is mentioned (Ex. 24:10 f). Conversely, the punishing aspect of God is present at the Red Sea where the tetragrammaton is mentioned (Ex. 15:3). Any misconcep tion arising from these verses is remedied through the use of Ex. 20:2, the first of the Ten Commandments, which contains both divine names. Hence, the main point of the midrash is that the different names of God ought not to impugn His unity. This is the core of the tradition and is the only interpretation present in MRSbY. To this core argument evinced in MRSbY has been added a further interpretation in MRI that divine justice and especially divine mercy were present at the giving of the Law because both divine names appear there 52). והוא בעולם הזה והוא לעולם הבא הוא לשעבר והוא לעתיד לבא שנ׳ רעו עתה כי אני אני הוא וגר כה אמר הי מלך ישראל וגר אני ה׳ ראשון וגו׳ Dt. 32:39, Is. 44:6, Is. 41:4 51) Mekhilta Shirta 4 and Bahodesh 5. A shorter version of the tradition ap pears in the Mekhilta de Rashbi (p. 81) on Bashalah 15 alone.

SeferSefer Klausner (Tel Aviv 1940) feels the passage in the Mekhilta of R. Simeon to be a later epitome of the passage in R. Ishmael's Mekhilta. In paraphrasing the Mekhilta of R. Ishmael, it has misunderstood some of the original import of the midrash. It seems to us that MRI has developed a sophisticated tradition about the justice and mercy of God, which was added onto an original midrash, which was concerned only with the repetition and change of divine names but the earlier midrash does not correspond precisely to MRSbY.</page><page sequence="18">Ν. Α. DAHL AND ALAN F. SEGAL 18 The subject of the whole Mekhilta passage, both the core tradition and the later accretions, is the unity of God, who is both merciful and just, who is also the sole deliverer of Israel and the giver of the Law, even though different names and images are used to describe His revelation at the Sea and at Sinai. The unity of God is further emphasized by an allusion to the interpretation of the name of God in Ex. 3 ("I am He who was", etc.) and by reference to Dt. 32:39, Is. 46:4, etc. which state that God is single and unique. A warning against heretics (or gentiles) who claim that there are "two powers in heaven" is introduced immediately after the comparison between the aspects of God revealed at Sinai and at the Sea. These heretics apparently believe in two corresponding divinities. Then, a further midrash is brought by R. Nathan, who may reflect an opponent who believes in at least one more divinity opposed to God 53). The text is not an obvious contradiction of the later rabbinic teaching about God's attributes, because the standard terms, m'lddath ha-dinha-din and middath ha-rahamim are not actually used. But, since the expanded tradition deliberately identifies Elohim with the merciful aspect of God, YHWH with the strictly just aspect of God, the contradiction with the received rabbinic doctrine can not be missed. Nor can it be subsumed under a special category, as were the "oath form" or the "hand of YHWH" traditions. This Mekhilta passage is therefore an independent witness demonstrating that the Philonic correlation of God's names with the divine qualities of mercy and justice was known in Palestine as well as Alexandria. Significantly, the tradition has grown up around the description of God as a "man of war" in the Song at the Sea of Ex. 15, a pericope which seemed to underlie some pre-Philonic traditions. Though this non-standard doctrine of God's justice and mercy is found in rabbinic literature, it is not clear that the rabbis themselves 53) The crux of this argument is the identity of the opponent of God in the midrash. The opponent may be merely a detractor of the law, who claims the Torah to be parocial. Several midrashim found nearby in the Mekhilta set the context for such remarks. However, the argument has been expanded beyond the scope of the giving of the Torah by means of the Isaiah quotation, where the creation, not the giving of the law, is the setting for the encounter between God and the opponent. In such a context only an antagonistic divinity can be God's critic. So, whether or not R. Nathan himself had a heavenly opponent in mind, it is probable that the tradition was eventually put to use against theologies of radical dualism, by means of the addition of the Isaiah passage. It should be noted that the majority of the "two powers" traditions evince the complementary pattern of divinity rather than the opposing kind.</page><page sequence="19">19 PHILOPHILO AND THE RABBIS ON THE NAMES OF GOD affirmed it as a doctrine. The identification may actually come from the heretics "who say there are two powers in heaven". In that case, the rabbis would only have recorded the heretical identification of divine names with attributes accidently, when they warned against the exegesis which was typical of the heresy. Therefore, a word is in order about the identity of this mysterious group 54). Various types of candidates can be inferred from the collection of biblical texts relevant to the heresy. Marmorstein suggested that the group which caused the rabbis to articulate their doctrine of God's "measures" was gnostic. This suggestion continues to seem reasonable, but that does not settle the problem of the identity of the heretics. In the first part of the midrash, the rabbinic polemic is likely to have had other targets than the extreme gnostics R. Nathan opposed, because the "two powers" are partners, not anta gonists. Not only that, in MRI the group is described as "gentiles" in the first paragraph and "heretics" in the second. This seems to argue for the existence of at least two different groups which were classified by the rabbis as believing in "two powers in heaven". The most interesting conclusion from the first part of the midrash is the centrality of scheme of corresponding deities to the heresy of "two powers". The prominent reference to Dan. 7:9 and 13 implicates many apocalyptic groups as well as Christianity, all of whom identified the second figure in Daniel's vision as their special savior. But the clearest example of the type of heresy which angered the rabbis is probably Gentile Christianity. Christians like Justin Martyr, for instance, justified their christology with the same passages which the rabbis found so dangerous. Justin reports that one of the Jews with Trypho admits that the "Lord" (YHWH) who punishes Sodom and Gemorrah is a different "Lord" {YHWH) from the one who made heaven and earth. He is just reticent to admit, much to Justin's chagrin, that the tetragrammaton in Gen. 19:24 refers to the Christ 55). The original target in any of these traditions cannot have been dualistic gnostics, as the powers discussed in the earliest midrash are not really opposed; they are merely different divine manifestations, designated by different names. Neither can the original target of the 54) For a fuller discussion of "two powers" heretics, see Alan F. Segal, Two Powers Powers in Heaven (Leiden 1977). 55) Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypbo, 56. This same passage (Gen. 19:24) is discussed by R. Ishmael b.

SEGAL 20 "two powers" epithet have been Marcion, who claimed that the god of salvation was entirely unknown in the Hebrew Bible. Hence, he would not use any Old Testament references—not even Dan. 7:9f—to demonstrate the existence of his "second power". Further more, since Hellenized Jews are characterized by Justin as holding such views, Christians are not likely to have been the original offen ders. The earliest heretics appear to have been Hellenized Jews or Judaized Christians who adhered to a logos doctrine or a doctrine of divine powers similar to that of Philo but who evidently lacked Philo's concern to preserve monotheism. These conclusions are not strictly dependent upon the date of the midrashic tradition under consideration. But it would help to have a general idea of the date of these rabbinic polemics. Anonymous midrashic traditions, especially ones with so many and varied elab orations, present huge problems in dating. Approximations only can be made as to the date of the material. It is almost impossible to reconstruct any Pharisaic or rabbinic material in the first century, unless it is quoted by a non-rabbinic source. But we have evidence of the these kinds of concerns in traditions ascribed to second century rabbis. For the purposes of dating the tradition, we need to distin guish between the basic tradition about the meaning of the name of God and the augmented tradition that the different names refer to God's aspects of mercy and justice. Of course, we know already that both themes may be earlier than the first century, since they were important to Philo. But the problem now is the date of the tradition in rabbinic literature. There is clear evidence that the second century was a time when the issue of God's justice and mercy was debated. We have significant evidence for rabbinic discussion of God's attributes in the Mishnah, which, unlike the Tannaitic Midrash, is still reliably dated to 200 C. E. and before. Several famous mish nahs discuss mercy and justice or good and evil, thus showing that these issues were important to the tannaim 56). It seems likely, then, that the Tannaim were quite concerned to develop a theology of God's attributes. 56) See, e.g., Ber. 5:3, 9:3, Meg. 4:9. The Amoraim even linked these mishnahs with the heresy of "two powers in heaven". The clearest examples of tannaitic concern with the attributes of God is Ber. 9:5 where Dt. 6:4 is interpreted to mean that one should love God with both the good and evil impulse. The word middahmiddahmiddah is taken to be derived from this passage. Furthermore, in San. 7:1 the names of God are associated with His different attributes.</page><page sequence="21">21 PHILOPHILO AND THE RABBIS ON THE NAMES OF GOD It is also possible that the traditions in the Mekhilta are all quite late. But, in this particular case, when we know of the Philonic past of the tradition and its context within second century rabbinic thought we have both external and internal reasons to believe that the second century dating is credible. Since the tradition of God's attributes, which is an addition to this midrash, is appropriate to the second century, it is very likely that the base tradition of God's change in appearance is at least as old and probably older. Starting in the second century, we also have some evidence that the motif of God's change of appearance is appropriate to rabbinic discussion 57). It therefore seems likely that the aggada recounted in the Mekhilta had its root in the earliest period of rabbinic thought. With these few observations on the antiquity of the rabbinic tra ditions, it is possible to outline the history of the issue of God's attributes and names in ancient Judaism. Throughout the Jewish community, God's justice and mercy were discussed in connection with the Hebrew names for God. However, the standard rabbinic doctrine only emerged in the late second century under pressure from Hellenistic Jews, Christians, and gnostics. Rabbinic evidence therefore supports the conclusion that could be drawn from the Philonic texts: Marmorstein was right to stress that Philo's doctrine of the meaning of the divine names was a widespread tradition. However, within the rabbinic community there is no conclusive evidence for the use of the Philonic model. Even any hypothetical use of Philo's system would have had to become obsolete before the time of Akiba and Ishmael—somewhat earlier than Marmorstein thought. The Mekhilta passage seems to imply that some people, called heretics by the rabbis, continued to favor the Philonic identi fication. Thus, the passage illustrates part of the channel of trans mission which Marmorstein was not able to demonstrate. Marmorstein's critics were right at several points, but most of them failed to come to grips with the larger questions which Mar morstein had raised. One reason for this failure was that they re mained satisfied with the examination and comparison of texts which 5י) R. Akiba, for instance, declares that the shekhina changes its aspect as Is rael's fate changes. (Pisha, XIV, Lauterbach, i, 113-115 and Sifre Behaalotekha 84). Ben Azzai mentions that only the tetragrammaton is used in reference to the sacrificial offerings, "so as not to give the minim a chance to humble us". (Sifre 143, p. 54a and b Men. 110b). None of these attributions should be accepted without question, but, at least, it gives us some inkling of the climate of opinion that was assumed to have existed in the second century.</page><page sequence="22">Ν. Α. DAHL AND ALAN F. SEGAL 22 Marmorstein himself had mentioned. But the problem of Philo's relationship to the midrash cannot be treated in a satisfactory way unless one ventures a redaction-critical analysis of a greater variety of existing texts. Hopefully, this paper has demonstrated that the enterprise has some promise and can lead to the detection of further points of contact between pre-Philonic and pre-rabbinic traditions, thus increasing our knowledge of Judaism in the first century. Outlook Outlook and Conclusion Before we attempt to draw any final conclusions, it is necessary to take a look at interpretations of the names of God outside Philo and rabbinic writings. One important piece of evidence is provided by Theophilus of Antioch, who wrote ca. 180 C.E. In To Autoljcus I 4, he comments upon the names of God: "He is called God because He founded (tetheikenai) all things . . . But He is Lord because He rules the universe". This Greek etymology is attested in Philo. But Theophilus goes on to interpret other names and, in contrast to Philo, he does not take theos and kjrios to symbolize hypostasized powers of God. Like Justin Martyr, Theophilus was unfamiliar with Philo. Rather, he appears to have drawn upon a less complex form of Jewish "philosophy", current in the Greek diaspora 58). Probably, he is an indirect witness to the persistence of the "Philonic" correlation of names and attributes in the diaspora, after the rabbinic doctrine had already been standardized. Only Theophilus's christo logy would have made him a "two power heretic" in the eyes of the rabbis. Theophilus and other Christian theologians would have agreed with the rabbis in opposing the distinction between the good and the righteous God made by Marcion and the radical gnostics, for both types of Christian heretics propounded a doctrine of anti-cosmic dualism in opposition to the concept of the good creator God of Jews and "psychic" Christians 59). The radical gnostics depicted not 58) See W. A.

For them, different divine names only distin guished between demonic powers 60). The syncretistic use of Hebrew names of God as designations of astral rulers of the seven heavenly spheres or of the Zodiac has little or no relation to the traditions known from Philo or the rabbis 61). A passage in the Apocryphon of John is of considerably greater interest for the purpose of this paper. It occurs in all four manuscripts of the Apocryphon but with some important variations 62). It draws upon an aggadic interpretation of Gen. 4:1, according to which not Adam but an angelic being, usually identified as Satan, was the man with whom Eve conceived Cain and Abel 63). According to the Apocryphon, it was the Demiurge, Ialdabaoth, who begot the two brothers. All manuscripts agree in identifying Cain and Abel with YHWH and Elohim—stating that the one was bear-faced and the other cat-faced, one righteous and the other unrighteous, one set over the higher elements of fire and wind, the other over water and earth, so that both Archons rule over the "grave", i.e., the psychic and hylic human body composed of the four elements. This appears to be an abstruse gnostic transformation of a doctrine of two cosmic (and anthropological) powers, designated by Hebrew names of God. In the gnostic system, none of the powers are con sidered to be good. The most remarkable fact, however, is that the manuscripts disagree about the identification of the two. According 1972), I, p. 457-470. For the more general problems, see the papers on "Rabbinic Polemics and Gnostic Response", see the papers read by A. F. Segal, N. A. Dahl,Dahl, and B. A. Pearson at the 1976 Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature. (To be published in the foreseeable future.) 60) According to E. Pagels, The Gnostic Paul (Philadelphia 1975), p. 15, it was a basic principle of Valentinian exegesis "that Paul uses the term 'Lord' to designate Yahweh, as 'God' designates the Father". If this is indeed the case, it would be a further proof of the historical connection between Valentinian gnosis and earlier forms of the "two power heresy". Unfortunately, the polemic of Irenaeus in Α. Η. III.5. 1-10.5, referred to by Pagels in note 10, p. 46, is no conclusive proof. 61) See e.g., Apocryphon of John, BG 8502, 40-42; Irenaeus, Α.

SEGAL 24 to the shorter versions, "Elohim is the righteous, YHWH the un righteous" 64). The longer recension states just the opposite 65). Thus, recensions of one and the same gnostic text attest a reversed identification of names and attributes, analogous to the difference between Philo and the rabbis 66). There is some evidence that in gnostic speculation Jewish ideas about the tetragrammaton, the shem ha-mephorash, were transferred to the higher of two Archons or to the supreme God of revelation and redemption, in contrast to the Creator of the world 67). A very peculiar doctrine is contained in the book Baritch, ascribed to a gnostic Justin and summarized by Hippolytus 68). The book dis tinguishes between three unbegotten powers: "The Good", the "father of all things created" who is called Elohim, and the female, psychic and earthly power called Edem or Israel. It reports that Elohim had a love affair with Edem, begat male and female angels, and created the world. After that he intended to ascend, leaving Edem behind. When he reached the limits of heaven, he saw a light better than the one he had created and realized that he had been mistaken in thinking that he was himself "Lord". Apparently, this means that he had incorrectly claimed the name kyrios for himself, 64) BG 62. 13-15 and CG III.l 31.14-16. 65 CG IV.1. 38.4-6 states this explicitly: "YHWH is righteous and Elohim is unrighteous". CG II.1 24.18-20 does not contain this clause but presupposes the same identification. We are indebted to Anne McGuire who has provided us with information about the different versions, edited by M. Krause, Die drei Versionen desdes Apocryphon des Johannes (Wiesbaden 1962). 66) Gnostic transformations of Jewish doctrines of two subordinate powers occur also in the descriptions of Sabaoth in The Hypostasis of the Archons (CG II.4, 86.20-97.23) and the Work Without Title, now called On the Origin of the World World (CG II.5, 97.24-127.17 = 145.27-175.17, ed. Bohlig and Labib). Accord ing to the Hypostasis (95.31-96.3), Wisdom made her daughter, Life, sit at the right of Sabaoth and the Angel of Wrath to his left. The parallel in the other work tells that Pistis Sophia placed Sabaoth to her right and the Archigenetor Ialda baoth, his father, to her left (CG II.5, 106.11-18). Both texts agree that since then right has been called Life or righteousness, and left represents unrighteous ness. The texts are more akin to merkabah mysticism than to Philo but do not relate right and left to the tetragrammation or Elohim. 67) In Hyppolytus's version of the doctrine of Basilides, a free rendering of Ex. 6:2 f., "I am the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and the name of God I did not disclose to them", is attributed to the Archon of the Ogdoad, Refutatio VII.25.4. Hippolytus's report about the Valentinians attributes a similar form of the quotation to the Demiurge, who did not announce the name of God, i.e., the hidden mystery about the Father and the Aeons, which he had learned from Sophia. See Refutatio, VI.36.2. 68) Refutatio V.26.1-27.5.</page><page sequence="25">25 PHILOPHILO AND THE RABBIS ON THE NAMES OF GOD whereas that name pertained to "the Good" 69). In contrast to most gnostics, Justin draws upon a tradition that associated kjrios, the substitute for the tetragrammaton, and not theos or Elohim, with the supreme, good God. In that respect, he contrasts with other gnostics, by being closer to the rabbis than to Philo. The book is not vehe mently opposed to the Jewish God. Even Elohim is considered to be pneumatic. He was enthroned at the right hand of "the Good", sending his third angel, Baruch, to Moses, the prophets, and also to Hercules. Only Jesus, however, was obedient enough to bring the true message about "the father" (i.e., Elohitn) and "the Good 70). This survey of outside evidence confirms what the analysis of Philonic and rabbinic texts has already indicated: The interpretation of the names of God involved several issues. The disagreement over the identification of divine names and qualities was superficial. The deeper issue was whether the names symbolized the complimen tary attributes of one God or referred to a plurality of more or less independent divine beings. Both of these issues must be seen in the general context of the confrontation of Judaism with Hellenistic culture, religion, and philosophy. Marmorstein realized this. His opponents, by contrast, seem to have been overly bound by the traditional distinction between Alexandrian and Palestinian Judaism or to have assumed, uncritically, that our rabbinic sources must represent without any development the doctrines of the Palestinian teachers at the time of Philo. The many fundamental differences between Philonic exegesis and rabbinic midrash should in no way be minimized. But a comparison with the type of interpretation represented by the pesher commentaries of the Dead Sea Scrolls makes it clear that both rabbis and Philo represent a more modern scholarly approach. It is characteristic of the more modern approach for exegetes to make observations in the texts, to detect and discuss problems, and to formulate rules for their solution. Apparent contradictions, repetitions, and redun dant phraseology were prominent among the problems discussed by both Philo and the rabbis. The comments about divine names and attributes typify the method, both in Philo and in the midrashim. 69) This is clear from the quotations of Psalms 118 (117) :19-20 and 110 (109) :1 in the report of Elohim's ascent and enthronement, Refutatio V.26.15-17. Else where in the fragment, kyrios can refer to the angel Baruch or to Elohim (V.26.29, 35 and 27.1). 70) For an analysis of the book, see E. Haenchen, "Das Buch Baruch", in Gott und Mensch, Gesatnmelte Aufsat^e (Tubingen 1965), p. 299-334.</page><page sequence="26">Ν. Α. DAHL AND ALAN F. SEGAL 26 Philosophical concepts of God cause problems for Philo. Though Moses and the philosophers seemed to hold a monotheistic belief in common 71), the God of the Torah did not tolerate any one besides Him, while the God of philosophy was elevated above all passions and intervened in worldly affairs by means of a plurality of divine powers. One might refer to these powers either by hypostasizing abstract concepts or by the names of the gods of popular polytheism. As a consequence, not only the anthropomorphisms of the Bible but also the ascription of passions like anger, zeal, or repentance to God caused problems for Jewish apologists. Philo came to terms with anthropomorphism and anthropopathism in three different ways: Anthropomorphic and anthropopathic language can be (1) interpreted allegorically; (2) it can be ascribed to the pedagogical wisdom of Moses; or (3) it can be taken to refer to subordinate powers of God. All three explanations were also known to the rabbis, but their concern was to maintain the absolute unity and otherness of God rather than to avoid anthropomorphism 72). Gnostics, on the other hand, revolted against the strict Jewish monotheism and turned the plurality of powers into a split within the deity. The interpreta tions of the divine names must be seen in the context of these deeper issues. In Alexandria, Philo held an intermediate position between radical allegorizers, who abandoned the literal meaning of the laws, and conservative exegetes who concentrated upon their exact meaning 73). Apparently he took over, elaborated, modified, and harmonized traditions from both sides. Even his teachings about God's names and attributes is complex. The logos doctrine can be combined with the doctrine of "two powers" and develops special importance. The combination makes it possible for Philo to retain the inner unity of mercy and judgment: the logos is the arbiter between the beneficient and the ruling powers, being superior to both 74). By 71) See, as one example, Josephus, Against Apion, II, 168-172. 72) See M. Kadushin, The Rabbinic Mind (New York 1952), p. 273 ff. Ka dushin corrects the views set forth be Marmorstein but hardly does full justice to the elements of truth contained in Marmorstein's theories. ,3) In Som. 230-33 Philo talks of those who take the image to be not a copy but the original form itself, implying an over zealous literalism. See also Cher. 12; 42. It is not clear that these people are conservative exegetes. But see Som. I,I, 17, 102 and II, 45, 301. Conf. 38, 190. In contrast with the traditionalists there were also extreme allegorizers who are more culpable according to Philo's perspective. See Migr. 16, 89 f and Wolfson, I, 61-72. 74) See above note 9.</page><page sequence="27">27 PHILOPHILO AND THE RABBIS ON THE NAMES OF GOD the same means, Philo can also maintain the distinction between God and His powers, avoiding any ascription of passion or punish ment to God. Philo was probably himself the first who harmonized the hetero geneous traditions and he may have remained the only one. Depend ing upon the criteria of evaluation, one can regard his achievement as a successful synthesis or as an inorganic compromise. In any case, it is likely that some of Philo's contemporaries in Alexandria stressed the inner unity of "mixture" of mercy and judgment, while others, less careful to safeguard the oneness of God, distinguished between at least two hypostasized powers. We do not know how far adherents of the two views came into direct conflict. But the midrash on Ex. 15:3, 20:2, and 24:10 attests that there was a clash and even a definite break between the two trends at a later date 75). We must therefore conclude that Philo's doctrine of "two powers" makes him an early witness for a more widespread and more serious issue that was ulti mately to polarize the Jewish community and to separate Jews from gnostics and orthodox Christians. Greek etymology of the names theos and kyrios favored the Philonic correlation of God's names and attributes or powers. This model was not only current in Alexandria in the first century but also known to rabbis who opposed it in second century Palestine. Our findings have confirmed Marmorstein's suggestion that the received doc trine of God's two measures represents a reaction against an early form of the "two power heresy". The rabbis do not speak about God's mercy and judgment (or goodness and punishment) as "powers" but as complementary "measures" which He metes out. By contrast, "two powers in heaven" became the heading for all deviations from strict montheism. It does not follow, however, that Marmorstein was equally right in thinking that the received rabbinic doctrine represented a simple reversal of an older system. We have found traces of two different trends in Philo. The dis tinction between God and His powers, including the logos, represents the same trend as the later "two powers heresy." In most cases, but not without exception, the tetragrammaton or, in Greek, kyrios, is taken to refer to the secondary manifestation of the godhead or to the second of two coordinate powers 76). The monotheistic trend, 75) See above p. 18. 76) Even orthodox Christians mostly took theos to refer to God the Father, whereas kyrios was more frequently used as a title of Jesus. For gnostic exceptions to the rule, see above, p. 22 f.</page><page sequence="28">Ν. Α. DAHL AND ALAN F. SEGAL 28 which stressed the unity of mercy and judgment, symbolized by the name "Lord God", is much more in line with later rabbinic doctrine. In this system, the identification between the name and attribute was secondary, since the exception to the rule proved the main point—namely, that God is just when He shows mercy and merciful when He judges. Possible hints of the Philonic identification within rabbinic writings are likely to confirm that the earliest moral was to demonstrate the mixture of divine attributes "). Only in the inten sely polemical atmosphere of the second century did the rabbis choose the system least likely to present problems, while most "two power heretics" adhered to the one that supported their view of the mediation of divine actions in the world. It is, therefore, likely that the rabbinic doctrine is to be seen as a standardization of one opinion rather than as a reversal of an earlier doctrine. Due to the lack of pre-rabbinic and pre-Philonic evidence, the origin and earliest form of the correlation between divine names and attributes remain unknown. But if we have been on the right track, the question of whether the rabbinic doctrine was due to reversal or to standardization is only of minor importance in com parison with the deeper and wider issues connected with the inter pretations of the names of God. ") As Η. Fischel has pointed out to us, not only the notion of one God and many divine powers, but also the idea of a harmony or "mixture" of opposites has analogies in Greek philosophy. On Parmenides' and Empedocles' contrasting pairs, Anger (or strife) and Love, see e.g., W. K. C. Guthrie, Λ Pre-Socratic Tradition Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus (Cambridge 1965), p. 166 f. Empedocles' simile of paints and a palate resembles Gen. R. 1:9 (on 1:1) where a philosopher and R. Gamaliel argue over a similar issue.</page></plain_text>
