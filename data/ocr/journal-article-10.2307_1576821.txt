<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Corporeal Stenographer Language, Gesture, and Cyberspace Tiffany Holmes Abstract The author describes her research and creative practice exploring the intersection between digital, biomedical, and linguistic modes of bodi- ly representation. She synthesizes traditional forms of painting with new computer and medical imaging technologies to call into question the relationship between visible and invisible bodily forms and actions. Her paintings and installations use scientifically rendered images of the body (from symbolic DNA sequences to developing cel- lular structures) in order to consider the role of the tools and technologies used to organize and view these images. The issue of visual, linguistic, and scientific literacy is thus a corollary concern. ihe organization and composition of the human body have challenged artists and scientists for centuries. Fifteenth-century Islamic drawings of the human form divide the body into five sec- tions: bones, nerves, muscles, veins, and arteries [1]. These early anatomists adopt the convention of using an ornamental script to trace the distribution of muscle throughout the body. Here the particular calligraphic style identifies specific corporeal features. Specially fabricated letters are substituted for flesh to map the human form. I am fascinated by the various ways in which our bodies have been coded and constructed throughout history. More specifically, I am interested in the way that languages describing the body are becoming more symbolic and consequently less legible to the lay person. Muscles are no longer identified with hand-painted script. Presently geneticists are working to translate the corporeal mass into a lengthy four-letter sequence based on nucleotide sequences in DNA. Abstract chromosomal codes such as "ACGGGTACCT" render the body less visible and more abstruse. While DNA codes portray a very specific body to a geneticist, the four-letter text strings could look like nonsensical jargon to the layperson. Com- puters use simple strings of O's and l's to describe a whole array of human gestures: ambulatory movement in a surveillance scenario, mouse movement generated by the human hand, etc. This binary code is operating constantly beneath our flashy desktop designs simulated by the latest software. In my interactive work Littoral Zone (1998), I explore the con- nection between bodies and letters. My work attempts to recon- struct a different visage of "the body" using fragments of past and present corporeal codes and some of my own invention. I wish to bring the manual dimensions of painting to the digitized domain of bodily representation. To accomplish this task, I have experi- mented extensively with programming the computer to behave in a manner that reflects my esthetic sensibility. Much of the cycling in the animations appears to be random, yet each mark and each word are originally penned by my hand or articulated by my mouth. The cycling actions ultimately construct a hybrid organism seemingly "cloned" from particles of decontextualized data-biot- ic, painted, and textual matter [2]. Because of its perpetual meta- morphosis, this virtual body is portrayed at once as a word, an image, a calligraphic scribble, and a meaningless letter string. These streaming transformations mirror the changing nature of corporeal representation in our day. Tiffany Holmes, 2055 Commerce Blvd., #221, Ann Arbor, MI 48103, U.S.A. E-mail: tgholmes@umich.edu.

Whether the subject is real or imagined makes no difference; the mark itself is a partial prod- uct of the unconscious; the act is a record or trace of cerebral electricity. When I begin a painting, I first ground the blank surface with a series of marks (Fig. 1). The preliminary drawing could consist of a charcoal sketch, a spray of ink, or a list of words. This initial layer of transcription is incredibly important in that it catalyzes the production of the remainder of the work. The artist Willem de Kooning, formerly a professional sign painter, adopted a routine of charging the canvas with a series of alphabetic flourishes to give him something to alter or destroy [3]. Yet my first tier of marks rarely disintegrates; rather they form the lower strata of the painting. The marks are a trace of brain activity as opposed to a way of initializing the brain to create [4]. The substrate, now charged with marks, registers as a visual conundrum of sorts. What, if anything, do the marks mean? In the first place, in fouling the unblemished expanse of the surface, they commit me to finishing the piece. Second, the marking process establishes presence on the surface of a material. Third, and most important, this painting represents its own pictorial language, a very individual, though highly mediated, form of handwriting. This rela- tionship of marking to lettering is critical to the understanding of my abstract paint- ings, which comprise a portion of the ani- mated chimeras in Littoral Zone. Norman Bryson expounds on the kin- ship between painting and writing in his discussion of flung-ink calligraphy. In this Japanese art practice, the artist focuses on an object, a material letter, and specifically casts the ink to disfigure the character. Bryson equates this practice with a warping of the field of vision: "The flinging of the ink marks the surrender of the fixed form of the image to the global configuration of force that subtends it.... The image is made to float on the forces which lie out- side the frame; it is thrown, as one throws dice. What breaks into the image is the rest of the universe, everything outside of the frame" [5]. This imaging of fluid contor- tion-of black colliding with white, of uncontrolled gesture intermingling with prescribed bodily motion, of recognizable forms dissolving into abstract ones-is pre- cisely the collapsed territory of my oil paintings, digital animations, and installa- tion work. The flung-ink calligraphers trans- form their language into unrecognizable i forms. At the very moment of visualiz- ing the letter and its * . orientation on - paper, the artist hurls the paint into a completely differ- ent configuration. ,. What was a letter for a fraction of a Fig. 1. Flung-ink study b second suddenly mutates into an organic entity in less than one or two seconds. Here the visible alpha- bet functions as a totally abstract system of recording the complexities of the world. In merging the practices of these ancient calligraphers with new technolo- gies, I explore markmaking as a time-based process-a process in which I can animate and automate my markmaking gestures to literally make paint move over time (as opposed to paint that dries inert on can- vas). After scanning an original drawing, I then direct its expansion or contraction digitally. I discover that I can make one stroke of my hand twist into another, split into two, or shrink into a more geometric form, such as a letter. After an initial series of experiments, I start to create an animat- ed alphabet of hybrid creatures. These anthropomorphic pulsings are composites of letter, ink, light, silicon, and time. In breeding the predictable universe of letters with my own cosmos of painterly markings, I construct a digital body that traverses the edges of language and art. The mutating figures seen in Littoral Zone are chimeras, part rigidified letter and part organic script. The process of constructing this strain of animated imagery mimics and in some ways caricatures the biological practice of cloning by combining various visual forms of corporeal representation (letters, words, images) into one entity. In a sense, I perform my own version of genetic engineering on language. To accomplish this goal, I write computer scripts that generate the transmutation of a letter into a gestural mark. In my case, the programming language of the computer " r y Tiffany Holmes.

Obfuscated words, flung ink, and mutated letters form the flesh, blood, and bone of these self-styled digital hybrids. In my installations, ancient callig- raphy meets genetic engineering as letters and bodies become mutually constitutive. Littoral Zone Littoral Zone brings auditory, tactile, olfactory, and visual sensations into the foreground. The observer must listen, smell, and touch his or her way through the installation. In this manner I challenge the primacy of the sense of sight. Even the word "SEE" takes on many different forms in the piece. For example, the word operates as a cursor in the digital compo- nent and it also becomes an audiovisual rant: "SEE, FEE, BEE." In the animation, much of the appropriated biological imagery is derived from microscopic por- traits of human eye tissue. I delight in using pictorial materials that playfully depict the mechanism of vision while the installation in which they appear actually challenges the primacy of vision in the act of seeing. I can exhibit my interactive digital ani- mation, Littoral Zone, both as an installa- 384 Tiffany Holmes, The Corporeal Stenographer</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2. From Littoral Zone. The navigator selects a letter specimen with forceps. tion and as a stand-alone piece shown on a monitor. In the installation version (exhibited at School 33 Art Center in 1998), a fabric scrim divides a 20 x 40-foot space in half. At the entrance to the darkened installation space, the viewer hears the layered sounds of an eye exam as well as unidentifiable mechanical noises. After entering the room, the viewer senses moisture emitted by a vaporizer. Approaching the installation itself, the observer sees a series of plexiglass paint- ings that sway in the air currents generat- ed by both the vaporizer and the data projector. These translucent panels are backlit by a digital animation that comes from behind the fabric scrim. In walking through this network of paintings, the viewer may notice their similarity to microscopic slides. Emerging from the inventory of abstract imagery, the viewer then walks around the scrim to the other side of the space. A podium lit from below beckons. The user, in touching the trackball situat- ed on the podium, assumes temporary control over the action of the projection (stopping the automatic transmission of the digital signal). From this side of the space the user views an enlarged version of what an interactor navigating the piece on a monitor would apprehend. Conversely, viewers caught in the maze of paintings on the other side of the scrim are unaware of who or what is controlling the animation. Metaphors of Flux and Change The title of Littoral Zone alludes to the metaphor that defines the piece. The lit- toral zone is the liminal space where water from a river or sea meets the shore. A hybrid locale, the littoral zone is a viscous composite of soil and water that changes its orientation perpetually as a result of tidal flow. I was inspired to choose this metaphor after studying writers who have discussed complex systems of transformation through a relevant analogy. Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari use the image of an arboreal rhi- zome, or branching root, to discuss princi- ples of multiplicity [6]. Jacques Lacan and Elizabeth Grosz choose the Mobius strip as an anchor for their reflections on the endless possibilities associated with definitions of corporeal identity [7]. The littoral zone is a very particular sort of edge, one that both expands and contracts. At this border, liquid becomes solid, dark encounters light, and trans- parency merges into opacity. This place, where a tremendous body of fluid collides with the vast expanse of soil, constitutes an amorphous area which extends almost infinitely in opposite directions. The lit- toral zone is like a tremendous rubber band stretched around the errant edges of our earthbound terrain. Scientists imagine that more than three billion years ago the first unit of life (a molecule that was capable of self-replica- tion) formed in the mudflats of the primeval seas. The shallow waters of the lit- toral zone may have been the birthplace of all living things. In biological texts, this semiaqueous medium of nutrients, miner- als, and water is referred to as "thin soup or nutrient broth" [8]. In Littoral Zone, I create a digital carica- ture of this primordial soup. I combine fig- ures from a variety of sources in order to synthesize a new strain of unclassified imagery that recombines information from a host of disciplines, such as art, biology, and linguistics. "Mutation" occurs when elements of a particular datum collide with elements from a contrary source. For exam- ple, the static icon of a birthday cake appro- priated from a child's eye chart turns into a spastic calligraphic spider when the viewer "touches" the birthday cake icon with a trackball. Letters become marks, marks spawn organisms, and organisms beget lan- guage. In one sense, the animation playfully accelerates the process of evolution. Sperm and Egg: Who Controls Whom? My interest in corporeal representation continues to evolve as a response to hierar- chical paradigms in science. These paradigms are often institutionalized by repeated misinterpretations of visual phe- nomena. One flawed model that still domi- nates biological pedagogy is the concept of fertilization. Most high-school science text- books still describe the union of sperm and the egg as an act of penetration: the sperm pierces the outer membrane to initiate for- mation of a zygote. However, microscopic studies in the 1970s revealed that the egg actually engulfs the sperm [9]. The rhetoric of penetration persists because patriarchal power structures are still prevalent in our culture, and scientific discourse is insepara- ble from culture. Computer artworks are beset with simi- lar issues. The general assumption is that the user dictates all action with a mouse. (This paradigm becomes phallocentric if one considers the anatomical content implicit in the word "joystick.") Littoral Zone randomly ascribes power to the viewer to disrupt a stereotypical "male" paradigm of control with regard to computer input devices (mice, trackballs, joysticks, etc.). When the navigator initially touches the Tiffany Holmes, The Corporeal Stenographer 385</page><page sequence="4">trackball, he or she is able to manipulate a set of virtual laboratory tools in the digital animation. However, as the navigator spends more time with the trackball, it quickly becomes apparent that "something else" is influencing action on the screen. Scripts written by me regulate the cycling of control in the animation, and thus ulti- mately remove agency from the interactor. Feminist theorists like Donna Haraway and many others have investigated the issues of authority and agency in science and technology [10]. The part of this work that particularly interests me is the histori- cal accounts of faulty observation which have undergone reinterpretation by mod- anatomist Berengarius reported, "The neck of the uterus is like the penis" [12]. Until about 1570, medical professionals denied the existence of the clitoris, claim- ing that it was actually a phallus. These biased interpretations led to women being classed as hermaphroditic creatures bearing both male and female sexual organs. Katherine Park has written a fascinating essay on this topic in which she examines anxieties about gender and sexual differ- ence that informed this "rediscovery of the clitoris" [13]. My title for the installation, Littoral Zone, incorporates a pun for this novel appendage once described as the "extremely monstrous thing that occurs in Fig. 3. In the Littoral Zone animation, these three letters recombine in a fraction of a second to form a new word. ern thinkers-one example being the ques- tion of penetration by the sperm or absorption by the egg. Another case in point is the morphology of the female genitals. The female body has been anatomically misinterpreted many times by scientists. Leonardo da Vinci, despite his vast contri- butions to the field of anatomy, allowed his sight to trick him in his drawing of male and female genitalia. In his Studies of the Reproductive System (c. 1508), the artist used the male genitals as a trope for the female; the ovaries were positioned to either side of the womb as a homology of the testes [11]. Fourteen years later, the the labia" [14]. The littoral zone is thus a metaphor not only for a mutable physical space but also for a contested corporeal space. Parodying the Powers of Instrumentation One of my primary artistic concerns is the need to inspire new modalities of dis- covering, representing, and appreciating our bodies as well as the world around us. Often the process of engendering new visu- al apprehensions involves some drastic reorganization of a familiar subject. For example in 1665, the early microscopist Robert Hooke had a terrifying encounter with the alphabet when he placed it beneath a lens. In examining a typeset page under a microscope, Hooke discovered imperfections "like smutty Daubings on a matt or uneven Floor" [15]. The lens revealed ruptures in what originally appeared to be a smoothly articulated reali- ty. The finest example of the dissolution of ocular constancy is Hooke's exposure of the period. This perfectly round typo- graphic mark, when magnified, exploded into "a great Splatch of London Dirt" [16]. For Hooke, the tool proved to be a cat- alyst for the reinterpretation of an observ- able phenomenon. After all, the microscope transforms the end point of a sentence into the dratted "Splatch." Since the beginning of civilization, scientists have been constructing tools to dissect the opti- cal complexities of our bodies. Such tools include not only technological implements but also scientific jargon and classification systems. Art historian Jonathan Crary has written about paradigmatic shifts in the process of observation. He asks, "How is the body, including the observing body, becoming a component of new machines, economies, apparatuses, whether social, libidinal, or technological?" [17]. I pose two related questions indirectly in my work. In the first place, how do sci- entific processes of visualization transform our perceptions of our corporeal selves? The second question has more to do with my relationship to my tools as an artist. How can my artistic process, which acknowledges these mutating perceptions of the body, revision the relationship between language, art and science, and technology? My mechanism of decoding and under- standing my body and the world around me has continually involved the process of dissection. As a child, I relentlessly picked at scabs, sunburn, and pimples in an attempt to gain information about the inte- rior of the body. Similarly, I spent a great deal of time at the river's edge prying apart all sorts of creatures to memorize their tex- tures and internal consistencies: oysters, crabs, jellyfish. My manner of handling paint is inextricably linked with childhood practices of feeling the insides of things in order to better see the outside. Often I scrape away the skin forming on a new lay- 386 Tiffany Holmes, The Corporeal Stenographer</page><page sequence="5">er of paint to create new visual forms out of the underlying pigments. For me, the probing practices associated with dissection gave me a visual literacy and esthetic sensi- bility that in turn affects the way I con- struct artworks [18]. In my interactive digital works, I seek to place my viewers in odd situations that force them to take on an unfamiliar role or participate in a curious activity in order to gain new perspectives. In my first interac- tive installation, MarkSPOT, viewers adopted the persona of a painter and were invited to create "marks" on a large wall projection. In my most recent pieces, I invite the viewer to adopt the role of a sci- entist. The indeterminate qualities of the specimen force the participant to evaluate its appearance, admire its mystery, and occasionally giggle over its absurdity. Par- ticipants gain a deeper understanding of the subject through the gestures of mark- making, dissecting, or simply seeing the familiar in a fresh light. In Littoral Zone, the viewer (or what Crary terms the "observing body") assumes the role of a virtual dissector. The eye-exam soundtrack infuses the space with a clinical tone. These ambient sounds cue the viewer to take on the position of voyeur. To emphasize this voyeurism, I usurp the viewing paradigm of the circular stage of the microscope. When a viewer manipu- lates the input device, the circular frame moves about the picture plane (the track- ball's round shape also has a formal reso- nance with the circular framing of the animation). Information within the frame swims in and out of focus. As a tool, the microscope brings the unseeable into close proximity with the viewer. On this quasi-intimate space of the stage, I present a script for the viewer to "act out." I use the microscope and its accessory tools-test tubes, beakers, for- ceps, scissors, scalpels, droppers-as props. On one level the narrative is about the invasive processes of dissection: cutting, piercing, probing. I intend for the viewer to participate in these phallic gestures. At the beginning of the interactive ani- mation, the viewer constructs a virtual "wet mount" (a slide to be viewed beneath a microscope). He or she stabs a word with a scalpel only to discover that the text swims haphazardly away. Using forceps, the view- er grabs a cantankerous letter to place on the slide (Fig. 2). After dropping a blood- colored stain on the now-sedated alphabet- ic mark, a cover slip floats mysteriously up to sheath the specimen. In the simulacra of the digital laboratory, the user imitates the gestures of the exploratory dissector. Yet the insertion of text, or data, for flesh completely transforms the pigmented object of study [19]. Further- more, many of the word specimens are slang terms like "DICK," "FUCK," "HOLE," and "CUNT." This substitution of profane language for a corporeal specimen is intend- ed to lure the viewer into participating in the phallic gestures of dissection through humor. The process of dismembering a "dirty" word also anesthetizes its crass sexual connotations. Once the letters are jumbled, the impudent word is silenced. Sexual punning flows throughout the piece in both the digital projection and the installation itself in an effort to endow the scientific laboratory with an erotic sensibili- ty [20]. In the projection, even the most sterile scientific material becomes an oppor- tunity to perform lexical burlesque. Just as minute alterations in the genetic code pro- duce physical variations, the substitution of one letter in the word "SEE" (Fig. 3) forms a whole population of deviant terms beneath the lens of the virtual scope: "SEX," "SEA," "SEEP," "PEE." Similarly, idiotic rhyming expressions like "procreate, masturbate, copulate, and amalgamate" school about like a group of minnows swimming away from the predacious word "FUCK." The nonsensical word games employed in Littoral Zone place language under the lens of the microscope. Words are at least as powerful as images in describing, evaluat- ing, and even misrepresenting a specimen or body. The various systems of representa- tion that I incorporate into my artworks challenge the underlying hierarchies but do not fully evacuate each system of meaning. I am not valuing language over science nor am I placing markmaking above words in my interpretation of the key constituents of the human body. Each representational sys- tem forms an overlay of information that is equally crucial to the evolution of my cor- poreal palimpsest. Seeing Flesh: Artistic and Personal Perspectives My revisioning of the human body as a hybrid of word, image, and mark is cat- alyzed by the increased presence of new imaging tools in the media. Such technolo- gies include magnetic resonance images (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and sonograms [21]. The study of human anatomy seems focused on microstructures as opposed to organs or physical appendages. Sliced into paper-thin segments and scanned, the flesh of the entire corporeal form is already completely represented in cross section by the Visible Human Project [22]. Many artists have appropriated scientif- ic imaging materials to ascribe new mean- ing to the human body [23]. Mona Hatoum performs with high-tech body mapping equipment in Corps etranger (1994), a video piece shot live from within the orifices of her own living tissues through endoscopy [24]. Similarly, Dou- glas Hahn employs brain scans (MRIs) to function as portraits in Urbs Turrita (1992). This video piece features "altered" domestic scenes (appropriated from Caspar David Friedrich) with bizarre female sub- jects portrayed by ghostly MRI imagery. Here the body, appearing as a flat pattern of color, is stripped of any visual evidence of cultural identity [25]. The virtual bodies that I create "evolve" from these symbolic coding structures that define high-tech imaging. Yet unlike Hahn's work, my bod- ies are not vacant. Layers of frolicking let- ters, whimsical marks, and profane language substantiate my bodies. My interests in various types of seeing and imaging technologies stems from three sources. The first is my horrible nearsight- edness. Diagnosed as legally blind, I regis- ter value and some color without my glasses [26]. When my vision was finally corrected at age six, I encountered a whole new world. When I paint, I purposefully remove my glasses from time to time to apply marks. Not seeing the medium fre- quently yields better results than focused observation. Second, my experience as an elementary-school teacher has allowed me to appreciate the associational capacities of young children. Younger eyes perceive con- Tiffany Holmes, The Corporeal Stenographer 387</page><page sequence="6">tent in a unique symbolic manner. They have individual codes of representation for boy, girl, dog, cat, etc. At this age, they are better at sketching spatial relationships than verbalizing them. One could say that the child talks with her hands and draws with her tongue. In my paintings, I often use children's sketches as a collage element, to get at the stark and iconic elegance of instinctive visual communication. In Lit- toral Zone, childlike pointing devices like jittery arrows and scribbled directives guide the user through the interactive component of the animation. The third and perhaps most significant force that fuels my interests is related to the cultural effects of biomedical technologies on modalities of corporeal representation. These technologies are designed to trans- late our corporeal interiors to enhance our understanding of our internal morphology. One of the most popular forms of inter- nal imaging, the sonogram, is problematic for patient consumption. In this case, an image encoded in one way (transmission of sound waves) is then recorded into some- thing "readable," the fetal snapshot. But ambiguities-or "noise"-in the visual information result: sonograms are approxi- mately 50% accurate in their determina- tion of fetal gender [27]. The inaccurate recording of gender is not entirely a result of distorted data, however. The snapshot is often misinterpreted because the viewer wanted to see what wasn't actually repre- sented (in most cases, a penis). Sonograms are thus often challenging to "read" as a result of viewer bias rather than faulty or complex imagery. Unlike sonograms, most other biomedi- cal imaging procedures test the viewer's lit- eracy in a different manner. The new atlases of the remote microstructures of the body are at once exotic and alienating. While the images produced by CT and PET scans and MRIs are without a doubt illuminating for trained medical profes- sionals, the complex imagery is totally inac- cessible to the unpracticed eye. These images are codified in a manner "far removed from everyday forms like the pho- tographic, the televisual, or the cinematic" [28]. The intricacy of the visual coding of medical images turns the patient an illiter- ate, an outsider to the interpretation and reading of his or her own body. Lay people thus surrender control over their body to experts trained to decipher complicated images. In my installation, I restage this very experience of alienation as a result of illiter- acy. Visitors to Littoral Zone are immedi- ately disoriented by learning the problems at hand: How do I "interact" with the piece? Am I doing anything with the track- ball? How do I dissect a word? Ironically, after grasping the functions of the multiple tools, the viewer becomes complicit in the "destruction" of meaning after obliterating the textual specimens with a virtual scalpel. After gaining some degree of control over the piece, the viewer is better suited to appreciate the unfamiliar environment of the installation. Only then is the visitor prepared to see the contradictory humor embedded in it. Conclusions Escaping the probing eye of the lens, the letters "C," "A," and "T" blur into an unreadable cloud of word, image, and mark. In these transformative procedures, I take away function from the form to emphasize the absence of utility and the presence of something else-obfuscated beauty, if you will. These letters once held the power of clarity as static signs. A "C" remains a "C" no matter what word or code it aids. On the other hand, a corrupt- ed "C"-blurred, transformed, or dirtied in some manner-is less prescriptive. Dis- tilled from its family, the abstracted letter permeates the work as a calligraphic vapor. My work establishes a tension between rigid order and rampant confusion. In Lit- toral Zone, the logic of grammar is invert- ed; groupings of words provide an excuse for childish and carnal wordplay. The con- flicts between whole and fragment, propri- ety and impropriety, clarity and illegibility are played out continually. Littoral Zone addresses the provocations of new technologies and the enduring chal- lenges of corporeal representation. As an artist investigating the interface between emerging biomedical technologies and digi- tal art, I invite viewers to participate in the making of art; they can then explore the intersection between individual and scien- tific representations of the human form. In this manner interactors make their own marks on the emerging digital body. References and Notes 1.

Throughout this paper, I will refer to the trans- forming animated creatures that populate my digi- tal animations as "virtual bodies." These entities are not like digitally generated creatures, such as bots, that are programmed to be autonomously "intelli- gent." Rather my self-styled creatures are scripted for a more limited number of behaviors. Many of the naughty or playful actions are triggered ran- domly; thus the creatures may appear to be acting on their own. However, this conduct is illusory. In my current work, I am not interested in exploring new ways of dealing with artificial intelligence (AI) and art. In some ways, because the behaviors of the creatures are so simple, I am parodying other art projects which claim to be creating new AI forms. Here I am specifically contrasting my work with Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau's A- Volve piece (ATR Laboratories, Kyoto, 1994-95). In this work, by virtually "touching" a marine phan- tasm (a projection into the bottom of a large water- filled tank) viewers trigger its spontaneous "evolution" into a more developed marine organism. 3.

I very much admire the work of artists who are literally investigating the form of the brain's synap- tic activity. Janine Antoni, in Sleep, creates an evocative reinstantiation of her dreams. In the per- formance, Antoni sleeps at night in the installation space on a simple bed with electrodes hooked to her head, recording the electromagnetic waves cre- ated by REM sleep. By day, Antoni weaves threads from her nightgown into a delicate tapestry that duplicates the wave pattern captured on the EEG. A cyclical and beautiful performance, Antoni demonstrates that data acquired from the uncon- scious can form the substrate for a compelling art- work.

These early explorations revealed new instantia- tions of natural beauty that were linked with the death or destruction of a living organism. The most challenging dissection that I've ever performed occurred during a summer I spent working at a museum of appropriate technologies. I resided with a group of insufferable vegetarians bent on reform- ing my carnivorous eating habits. They cajoled me into believing that I should demonstrate my ability to take responsibility for the contents of my stom- ach. These conversations ultimately led me to slaughter, cook, and consume a rabbit in front of my critics. The sequence of events proved psycho- logically haunting (a fact which I hid from my audience). In other words, when I commandeered the tools of the butcher, I attempted to assume an appropriately dispassionate attitude toward my sub- ject. Yet the overall experience provided a whole new vantage point on the life cycle. I'll never forget the eerie sensations of sight, touch, and smell asso- ciated with the transformation of a captive creature to main course. 19. The concept of substituting data for flesh was inspired by William Gibson's Neuromancer (New An Introduction, trans. Robert Hurley (New York: Vintage Books, 1990) p. 58. 21.These ideas were gathered from a keynote address given by Sherry Turkle at the Eighth Inter- national Symposium on Electronic Art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago on 24 September 1997.

She is there as a member of the Michigan Society of Fel- lows, a group of scholars who gather to promote collaborative projects and inter- disciplinary research. Holmes' artworks explore the intersection between digital, linguistic, and biological modes of bodily representation. She has most recently pre- sented her work at SIGGRAPH '99 in Los Angeles and at the International Society for the History of Neuroscience's annual con- ference in Zurich. York: Ace Books, 1984). 20.Michel Foucault provocatively argues that Western civilization has lost esthetic and carnal appreciation for the flesh. We lack an ars erotica as a result of our singular pursuit of a science of sexu- ality. See Foucault, A History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: Tiffany Holmes, The Corporeal Stenographer 389</page></plain_text>
