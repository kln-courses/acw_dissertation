<plain_text><page sequence="1">Linda Gregerson THE SOWER AGAINST GARDENS The gods, that mortal beauty chase, Still in a tree did end their race. -Andrew Marvell L ouise Gluck is one of those enviable poets whose powers and dis- tinction emerged early and were early recognized. Her work has been justly admired and justly influential, as only work of the very first order can be: work that is so impeccably itself that it alters the land- scape in which others write while at the same time discouraging (and dooming) the ordinary homage of direct imitation. In 1992 Gluck pub- lished a sixth book and in 1996 a seventh, which, in their sustained engagement with inherited fable and inherited form, in their simultane- ously witty and deadly serious subversions, constitute a deepening so remarkable that it amounts to a new departure. These books are unlike one another in any number of outward dispositions, but they share a com- mon intellectual purchase; they are two poles of a single project. 1. Like Me The Wild Iris makes its entrance late in the life of a tradition and its self-wrought woes: the moral and aesthetic dilemmas of sentimental projection, the metaphysical dilemma of solitude (if the others with whom I am in dialogue are merely the projections of self, I am alone in the world, and, worse, the world has been lost on me). The poet plants herself in a garden and dares its other Creator to join her. The poet construes her 115</page><page sequence="2">The Kenyon Review garden to be an anthropomorphic thicket and a series of moral exempla. The poet ventriloquizes all the voices-floral, human, transcendent-in a family quarrel about love and sustenance. With equal portions of bravura and self-deprecation, wit, and rue, The Wild Iris mindfully renders its dilemmas by means of an interwoven series of dramatic monologues. These have, some of them, been published separately (they are poems of great individual beauty), but they are not separable: the book is a single meditation that far exceeds its individual parts. The monologues are of three sorts: (1) those spoken by a human persona to God, or to that which holds the place of God, (2) those spoken by the botanical inhabitants of the garden cultivated by the human per- sona, and (3) those spoken by divinity. The poems addressed to God take their titles and their rhetorical premise from the Christian canonical hours (here reduced from seven to two), which mark the daily cycles of prayer. The poems spoken by flowers, groundcover, and one flowering tree take their color and argument from the circumstances of individual species (annuals vs. perennials, shade plants vs. sun plants, single blossoms vs. multiple): excluded from voicing are only those vegetable denizens iden- tified with human "use" or consumption. The God-voiced poems take their titles from the saturating conditions of nature: weather, season, the qualities of wind or light. The poet is clearly aware that her central device, the affective identification that characterizes so large a portion of nature poetry in English, has sometimes borne the stigma of "fallacy," so she incorporates a preemptive ironist: The sun shines; by the mailbox, leaves Of the divided birch tree folded, pleated like fins. Underneath, hollow stems of the white daffodils, Ice Wings, Cantatrice; dark leaves of the wild violet. Noah says depressives hate the spring, imbalance between the inner and the outer world. I make another case-being depressed, yes, but in a sense passionately attached to the living tree, my body actually curled in the split trunk, almost at peace, in the evening rain almost able to feel sap frothing and rising: Noah says this is an error of depressives, identifying with a tree. Whereas the happy heart wanders the garden like a falling leaf, a figure for the part, not the whole. ("Matins" 2 ) 116</page><page sequence="3">Linda Gregerson If we are paying attention, we can discern the season before Noah names it: daffodils are a spring flower; the leaves of the birch tree are as yet unfolded. But the foreboding that attaches to the season is entirely inexplicit until Noah is made to comment upon it and, commenting, to deflate it. "Entirely" is perhaps misleading. In situ, in the full Wild Iris, some portion of foreboding inevitably infects this poem by way of the poem that immediately precedes it. In that previous poem, which is also the title poem, the awakening rendered in the voice of an iris is a transi- tion of stirring beauty ("from the center of my life came / a great fountain, deep blue / shadows on azure seawater") and intractable pain ("It is terri- ble to survive / as consciousness / buried in the dark earth"). But that which is metaphysical in "The Wild Iris" and mythic in the mind of the "Matins" speaker (notice her partial invocation of Daphne) is in Noah's breezy analysis a thing considerably more banal. Instead of ontology, the garden's resident ironist discerns psychology; instead of tragic insight, the symptomatic "presentation" of temperament or disease. This witty, tran- sient pathologizing of point of view produces a marvelous mobility of tone, a mobility manifest in local instances of Gluck's earlier work but never so richly developed as in the present volume. And never so strategically important. By anticipating and incorporating the skeptical reader, by fash- ioning the poetic sequence as a dialogue with disbelief, the speaker pro- cures considerable license for her extravagant impersonations of violets, of witchgrass, of Eve in the Garden, nay, of God. We find early on that we will grant this speaker any number of investigations-by-means-of-likeness. And why? Because we like her. God and the flowers speak with the voice of the human; the human writer has no other voice to give them. The flowers sense, or describe sensation, in unabashedly human terms: "I feel it / glinting through the leaves," says the shaded vine, "like someone hitting the side of a glass with a metal spoon" ("Lamium" 5). They measure aptitude by contrast or analogy with human aptitude: "[T]hings / that can't move," says the rooted tree, "learn to see; I do not need / to chase you through / the garden" ("The Hawthorne Tree" 18); "I am not like you," says the rose, "I have only / my body for a voice" ("The White Rose" 47). God speaks in the voice of an earthly parent who has reached the end of his tether: "How can I help you when you all want / different things" ("Midsummer" 34); "Do you suppose I care / if you speak to one another?" ("April" 20). God 117</page><page sequence="4">The Kenyon Review explains himself by analogy and contradistinction to the human: I am not like you in this, / I have no release in another body" ("End of Summer" 40). God, like his creatures, assumes the simplifying contours of the famil- ial: "You were like very young children, / always waiting for a story.... / I was tired of telling stories" ("Retreating Light" 50). But likeness marks an irreparable chasm as well: So I gave you the pencil and paper. I gave you pens made of reeds I had gathered myself, afternoons in the dense meadows. I told you, write your own story. Then I realized you couldn't think with any real boldness or passion: you hadn't had your own lives yet, your own tragedies. So I gave you lives, I gave you tragedies, because apparentdy tools alone weren't enough. You will never know how deeply it pleases me to see you sitting there like independent beings ... ("Retreating Light" 50) That "like" is ice to the heart. Those who achieve authentic independence require no "like." Shadowing this book is the troubling possibility, indeed, the cer- tain knowledge, that its analogies are false or partial. "Whatever you hoped," says God in the voice of the wind, "you will not find yourselves in the garden, / among the growing plants. / Your lives are not circular like theirs" ("Retreating Wind" 15). Worse yet from the poet's perspec- tive, her analogies may be forced: "[I]f this were not a poem but / an actual garden," one skeptical interlocutor opines, "then / the red rose would be required to resemble nothing else, neither / another flower nor / the shadowy heart" ("Song" 27). Our Renaissance forebears had a term for the clothing of divinity in earthly garments: they called this process "accommodation." Because we are weak, because we cannot behold divinity face to face, God "accommodates" himself to our limits, agree- ing to be known by elements available to human sense. These measures, however, are imperfect and interim: 118</page><page sequence="5">Linda Gregerson I've submitted to your preferences, observing patiently the things you love, speaking through vehicles only, in details of earth, as you prefer, tendrils of blue clematis, light of early evening- you would never accept a voice like mine, indifferent to the objects you busily name, your mouths small circles of awe- And all this time I indulged your limitation ... ("Clear Morning" 7) Gluc'es couplets do not in any straightforward sense coincide with the divisions of dialogue, but they do, subtly, remind us that accommoda- tion is a two-part contract. God's patience is not infinite: "I cannot go on / restricting myself to images // because you think it is your right / to dis- pute my meaning" ("Clear Morning" 8). In order to grant his creatures an interim meeting place, the Creator agrees to interim diminishment. But this delicate contract breaks down the minute it is presumed upon: You were not intended to be unique. You were my embodiment, all diversity not what you think you see searching the bright sky over the field, your incidental souls fixed like telescopes on some enlargement ofyourselves- ( "Midsummer" 34-35) Do not flatter yourselves, the Creator warns. Despite what you imagine, what I allow you for a time to imagine, I am not like you. 119</page><page sequence="6">The Kenyon Review 2. We And you are plural. You are mere repetitive examples, as the crowd beneath your feet can witness: Not I, you idiot, not self, but we, we-waves of sky blue like a critique of heaven: why do you treasure your voice when to be one thing is to be next to nothing? Why do you look up? To hear an echo like the voice of god? ... ("Scilla" 14) The plural pronoun is a reproach to vanity, and in The Wild Iris it issues not only from below but from above as well, and in the harsher sec- ond person: You wanted to be born: I let you be born. When has my gref ever gotten in the way of your pleasure? Plunging ahead ... as though you were some new thing, wanting to express yourselves ... never thinking this would cost you anything, never imagining the sound of my voice as anything but part of you- ("End of Winter" 10) The accusatory mode is one the human persona can adopt as well. "[H]ow can I live / in colonies, as you prefer," she asks, "if you impose / a quarantine of affliction, dividing me / from healthy members of / my own tribe" ("Matins" 26). This counter-complaint, with its foundational recourse to a singular self, is all the more credible for missing the point. But the leverage inherent in the first-person plural has not been entirely lost on the human speaker: she too can manipulate the moral advantage in numbers when she will: "Unreachable father, when we were first/ exiled from heaven, you made / a replica, a place in one sense / different from heaven, being / designed to teach a lesson" ("Matins" 3). In one sense, the 120</page><page sequence="7">Linda Gregerson speaker's imperturbable assumptions about didactic function are simply another manifestation of self-regard: the garden cannot simply be; the gar- den must mean; it was madefor me. And though the speaker describes an affliction shared with others, or one particular other, of her kind, the shared aptitude appears to be for solitude: "Left alone, /we exhausted each other" ("Matins" 3). What lifts these passages above the common run of vanity is the ground of knowing they describe: "We never thought of you / whom we were learning to worship. / We merely knew it wasn't human nature to love / only what returns love" ("Matins" 3). In The Wild Iris as in its dominant line of lyric forebears, unrequited longing is the constitu- tive feature of consciousness. The garden is a sign because it is redolent with absence. The sharers in the garden come to know themselves by knowing that something is missing; their very failure to sustain one another is part of the message. Given all this absence, what may we infer about the Maker? He has absconded. His voice is "the persistent echoing / in all sound that means good-bye, good-by / the one continuous line / that binds us to each other" ("End of Winter" 10-11). The "we" that includes deity is a "we"7 shot through with departure, so in his leaving, the deity has left us one another, another "we." And how have we made use of this solace? No one's despair is like my despair- You have no place in this garden thinking such things, producing the tiresome outward signs: the man pointedly weeding an entire forest, the woman limping, refusing to change clothes or wash her hair. Do you suppose I care if you speak to one another? But I mean you to know I expected better of two creatures who were given minds: if not that you would actually care for each other at least that you would understand grief is distributed between you, among all your kind, for me to know you, as deep blue marks the wild scilla, white the wood violet. ( "April" 20) 121</page><page sequence="8">The Kenyon Review The irritable reaching after uniqueness ("No one's despair is like my despair") has taken its toll on human community. Despair has become for the couple in the garden a competitive pastime. But behind the ortho- dox proposition that despair is a species of pride, self-made and self- sustained, lies a yet more chilling possibility: what if we are on to the truth in spite of ourselves? What if grief is indeed our only claim to distinction? When the biblical faithful are forced to consider that their ends may not be coincident with the ends of the Creator, they have generally contrived to find this difference reassuring: God knows better; God makes us suffer for our own good. But what if God doesn't know better at all? Or what if his knowing doesn't have much to do with us? What if, except for our suf- fering, God could not tell us apart? The distributed personae of The Wild Iris think through to the other side of this all-but-unthinkable proposition from time to time, think beyond the obvious panic such a proposition induces, and address deity as another of the vulnerable species of creation: -I am ashamed at what I thought you were, distant from us, regarding us as an experiment ... ... Dear friend, dear trembling partner, what surprises you most in what you feel, earth's radiance or your own delight? ("Matins" 31 ) This is not the voice of first, or naive, intimacy, not the voice of the child who takes for granted that the parent is near, but the voice of willed, or revisionist, intimacy, the voice of the adult who has wearied of blame. It is a voice that may be adopted not only by the privileged species for whom the garden was created but also, and with equal eloquence, by the garden's humblest residents: Because in our world something is always hidden, small and white, small and what you call pure, we do not grieve as you grieve, dear suffering master; you are no more lost 122</page><page sequence="9">Linda Gregerson than we are, under the hawthorn tree, the hawthorn holding balanced trays of pearls: what has brought you among us who would teach you, though you kneel and weep, clasping your great hands, in all your greatness knowing nothing of the soul's nature, which is never to die: poor sad god, either you never have one or you never lose one. ( "Violets" 21) Nowhere in this limpid book does its triangular logic emerge with greater resonance. The human addresses God for the most part; the flow- ers and God address the human. And sometimes, to the flowers, the human appears in the guise of God, as flawed as the God to whom humans turn. But where is the human in "Violets"? Between "our world" and "your great hands," the human may be present, for once, chiefly by omis- sion. And the posited soul: how is it that the violets know it? Do they have a soul? Does God? Does one have to have a soul in order to know the nature of the soul? Or does one know the nature of the soul only from the outside, only by being without one? Are we to imagine that the poor sad god in the garden grieves at being without a soul? Or does he grieve because he is unable to be rid of the soul? The only point on which the violets appear to speak unambiguously, a point quite devastating enough, is that grieving will not make a soul. We three then: the two in dialogue and the one just beyond the bounds of dialogue, in whom the dialogue is grounded. The triangular manipulation of presence is as old as the lyric itself. He who sits beside you, writes Sappho. She that hath you, Shakespeare writes. Jealousy stands for but also masks a more frightening possibility. "Much / has passed between us," writes Gliick; "or / was it always only / on the one side?" ("Matins" 13). 123</page><page sequence="10">The Kenyon Review 3. Reciprocal The spectral possibility that gives lyric its urgency is not that the beloved isn't listening, but that the beloved doesn't exist. Prayer takes place at the edge of a similar abyss: Once I believed in you; I planted a fig tree. Here, in Vermont, country of no summer. It was a test: if the tree lived, it would mean you existed. By this logic, you do not exist. Or you exist exclusively in warmer climates, in fervent Sicily and Mexico and California, where are grown the unimaginable apricot and fragile peach. Perhaps they see your face in Sicily; here, we barely see the hem of your garment. I have to discipline myself to share with John and Noah the tomato crop. ("Vespers" 36) The poet's logic here is that of clever blackmail. God won't show? Perhaps he can be taunted into breaking cover. The speaker plants a fig tree, or the story of a fig tree, as a dare. When the fig tree predictably dies, the dare modulates to witty demotion. Are you not here, Father? Perhaps you are somewhere else? Or perhaps you are littler than we thought. To propose that God might "exist exclusively in warmer climates" is to bait a with- holding deity: it goes without saying that God can be no God unless he is everywhere at once. Or does it? Perhaps the absurdity cuts both ways. Perhaps comedic gesture throws into relief the deep peculiarity of an all- or-nothing system that is premised on "jealousy." A jealous God gets the jealous children ("I have to discipline myself," etc.) he deserves. If there is justice in some other world, those like myself, whom nature forces into lives of abstinence, should get the lion's share of all things, all objects of hunger, greed being praise of you. And no one praises more intensely than I, with more painfully checked desire, or more deserves 124</page><page sequence="11">Linda Gregerson to sit at your right hand, if it exists, partaking of the perishable, the inmnortal fig, which does not travel. ("Vespers" 36) Gospel has promised that the poor shall possess the kingdom of heaven, and the poet wants her share, "the lion's share," of this compen- satory promotion. Far from admitting greed as grounds for penance, she brazenly advances greed as the badge of special comprehension and thus of special desert. If God has bounty to dispense, then perhaps, like other patrons, he may be bribed. Praise is the coinage of patronage, whose darker side is "if." "If there is justice in some other world": the conditional clause says justice in the present world has fallen short. "If it exists": the conditional clause insinuates that part of the power, and part of the power to judge, resides with the believer. If the Father, in order to exist, requires our faith as we require his bounty, we may have found the key to recipro- cal consent. But lest the contract prove too dry, the poet does not stop here, does not pause too long to congratulate herself for unmasking the circular structure of vested interest. She returns instead to the object that passes between the master and the lovers in the garden, that makes the longing palpable, or nearly so: the promised, the withheld, the here-and- absent fig. For the lover is a gardener too: In your extended absence, you permit me use of earth, anticipating some return on investment. ("Vespers" 37) This gardener glances obliquely at the parable of the talents (see Matthew 25; see Milton's 19th sonnet). It is a useful parable, invoking spiritual and mercenary economies in unseemly proximity. Unseemliness prompts resistance, a common heuristic device. It also prompts reproach: I must report failure in my assignment, principally regarding the tomato plants. ("Vespers" 37) Adopting the disconsonant diction of spreadsheet and quarterly report, the gardener achieves a wicked deadpan, fair warning that she does not intend to shoulder the failure alone: 125</page><page sequence="12">The Kenyon Review I think I should not be encouraged to grow tomatoes. Or, if I am, you should withhold the heavy rains, the cold nights that come so often here, while other regions get twelve weeks of summer. ("Vespers" 37) The multiplying indecorums now include domestic comedy. The disgrunded dependent resourcefully finds that she is not to blame after all, that someone else has caused her fault, someone whose crime is the mis- apportionment of original love. And then, apparent concession: "All this / belongs to you." But the concession is quickly withdrawn: . . . AI this belongs to you: on the other hand, I planted the seeds, I watched the first shoots like wings tearing the soil, and it was my heart broken by the blight, the black spot so quickly multiplying in the rows. I doubt you have a heart, in our understanding of that term. You who do not discriminate between the dead and the living, who are, in consequence, immune to foreshadowing, you may not know how much terror we bear, the spotted leaf, the red leaves of the maple falling even in August, in early darkness: I am responsible for these vines. ("Vespers" 37) The hilarious, instantaneous taking back of that which was fleetingly granted-God's proprietary interest in creation-begins in petulance: mine, says the poet; the suffering is mine. But petulance expands to a countercharge-you have no heart-that bit by bit accumulates plausi- bility. God's loftier perspective, his comprehensive vision, begins to look like insufficiency. For comprehensiveness is by its very nature incapable of something too, incapable of "foreshadowing," of temporal habitation, of partialness and partiality, the realms of feeling possessed by those who are subject to time. Unfolding these realms, the human voice becomes tute- lary, makes concession to the newly contemplated incapacities of deity: "You may not know." And then the inventory of terror: the spotted leaf, the falling leaf, the early darkness. And, signaled by the colon, the syllogistic revelation: I 126</page><page sequence="13">Linda Gregerson am the only one left to be responsible. The line is not merely syllogistic, of course. Spoken within the parameters of apostrophic address, and spoken to one who might have been assumed to be responsible himself, it is a rep- rimand: unlike you, I take my responsibilities to heart. The reprimand is also a piece of gamesmanship, another in the series of rhetorical moves designed to flush God out. By what standard may we judge its success? God has not, we must confess, been coerced into unambiguous manifes- tation. On the other hand, the game has not quite stalled. For even as the speaker makes her sinuous case for self, something beyond the self-a "we" who bear the terror, the vines-has claimed the selfs attention. This may be small. It is certainly strategic. But even in the momentary, the strategic assumption of responsibility, the self accrues a new degree of moral dignity. This moment may be as close as God will come. In poem after poem, The Wild Iris delineates a reciprocal drawing out of spirit. This is not to say it is a sanguine book: Sometimes a man or woman forces his despair on another person, which is called baring the heart, alternatively, baring the soul- meaning for this moment they acquired souls- ("Love in Moonlight" 19) Moonlight is reflected light, light "taken from another source," and love in this light a kind of violent seizing, or theft. The God who may or may not exist may take his logic from moonlight or love or, failing that, from para- bles. "You are perhaps training me to be / responsive to the slightest bright- ening," the poet ventures. "Or, like the poets, / are you stimulated by despair?" ("Vespers" 43). The poet takes a walk at sunset in the company of her despair. And in helpless arousal or deliberate grace, in one of two contrary modes, the God she refuses to look for appears: As you anticipated, I did not look up. So you came down to me: at my feet, not the wax leaves of the wild blueberry but your fiery self, a whole pasture of fire, and beyond, the red sun neither falling nor rising- I was not a child: I could take advantage of illusions. ("Vespers" 43) This final resolution might be epigraph to the entire book of the garden. 127</page><page sequence="14">The Kenyon Review 4. Domestic The domestic comedy that offers counterpoint to metaphysical debate in The Wild Iris assumes center stage in Meadowlands, the book of poems Gluck published four years later. In this new book, the garden has given way to landscape of a different sort: the grasslands behind a childhood home on Long Island or surrounding the home of a twenty-year marriage in Vermont, the grasslands long buried beneath a football sta- dium in industrial New Jersey. Gluck's subject has long been the zero sum game of the nuclear family (even when she grants a place to grandparents, aunts, and a sister's children, they are merely the reiterative instances of nuclear entrapment). The wit and the paradox, the razor-edge renderings of human motivation and human stalemate have been in place for decades. But now they are fresher, deeper than ever before. What has moved the project forward so dramatically is a structural insight: the deployment of inherited patterns (devotional hours, growing season, gar- den epic, voyage epic, scripts for different voices) on a book-length scale. Like The Wild Iris, Meadowlands has been constructed as a single argu- ment, internally cross-referenced, dramatically unified. Its story is the breakdown of a marriage, and its template is Homeric. What has the marriage in Meadowlands to do with the story of Odysseus and Penelope? Its time span is roughly twenty years, divided into two decade-long segments, one of them "happy." Its measure is roughly the span of a young son's growing into manhood, and judgment, and ironic commentary. Its outward incidents are driven by a husband's appetite for adventure. Its deeper momentum derives from the tension between excursus and domesticity. But the template yields rich results precisely because its fit is only approximate. Little soul, little perpetually undressed one, do now as I bid you, climb the shelf-like branches of the spruce tree; wait at the top, attentive, like a sentry or look-out. He will be home soon; it behooves you to be generous. You have not been completely perfect either, with your troublesome body you have done things you shouldn't discuss in poems. Therefore 128</page><page sequence="15">Linda Gregerson call out to him over the open water, over the bright water with your dark song, with your grasping, unnatural song-passionate, like Maria Callas. Who wouldn't want you? Whose most demonic appetite could you possibly fail to answer? Soon he will return from wherever he goes in the meantime, suntanned from his time away, wanting his grilled chicken. Ah, you must greet him, you must shake the boughs of the tree to get his attention, but carefully, carefully, lest his beautitul face be marred by too many falling needles. ("Penelope's Song" 3) If the second Homeric epic has held enduring appeal for female narrators, this surely has something to do with Penelope's leveraged posi- tion in a complex economy of desire. The human heroines of the Iliad are essentially single-function figures, the bearers of prophecy, grief, beauty, and fidelity in a world whose primary contests-erotic, political, martial- are waged by men. But Penelope's position is sustained by ambiguities as rich as those that sustain Achilles. She weaves a shroud for a patriarch who is not yet dead; she rules a royal household, albeit in a compromised and declining state, during the prolonged absence of her husband and the minority of her son; she entertains a populous band of suitors whose extended address makes her uniquely immune to the erosions of age. Penelope has every reason to delay, and the reader has every reason to lodge in her vicinity. Her cup is never empty, her position ever summary: wife, mother, queen, perpetual subject of desire. If the quality of that desire is somewhat clouded by a husband's waywardness and the suitors' greed and boorishness, its breadth and duration are nevertheless the stuff of fantasy. Finally, crucially, Penelope's composite position makes her a center of consciousness, something to which not even the paragon Helen may aspire. "[Blut carefully, carefully, lest / his beautiful face be marred / by too many falling needles." The poet wears her mythic trappings lightly when it suits her: the frank anachronisms of Maria Callas and grilled chicken are fair indicators. The falling needles of a pine tree may be a poem's only oblique allusion to the heroine's clothworking artistry, which 129</page><page sequence="16">The Kenyon Review signifies retirement (the upstairs loom) and an aptitude for aggression (some damage to the hero's face). The framework of Meacdowlands wiRl open to admit any number of irreverent intrusions from late in the second millenium: a dishwasher, a purple bathing suit, the neighbors' klezmer band, a resolute vernacular. Nor are the booWs mythic templates exclu- sively Homeric: one poem draws its title and its premise (the ordinary miracle of marriage) from the wedding at Cana, one is addressed to the serpent of Genesis, several make of birds and beasts and flowering plants a built-to-purpose parable. Narrative foundations are overlapping and dis- tillate: the wife divides her perspective among several alter egos, several island wives, including her chief rival, Circe. The husband's reiterated departure seems sometimes to be his departure from the modern mar- riage, sometimes the infidelities that prepare for that departure, some- times Odysseus' departure for Troy, sometimes his serial departures on the homeward trip to Ithaca, sometimes the shadowy final departure rehearsed in epic continuations like the Inferno or the lost Telegonia.' The great advantage of broad outline is its suppleness, its freedom from clutter. The Greeks are sitting on the beach wondering what to do when the war ends. No one wants to go home, back to that bony island; eveyone wants a little more of what there is in Troy, more life on the edge, that sense of every day as being packed with surprises. But how to explain this to the ones at home to whom fighting a war is a plausible excuse for absence, whereas exploring one's capacity for diversion is not. ("Parable of the Hostages" 14) This freedom from clutter is a rhetorical talent shared by Telemachus, whose earlier incarnation was as Noah in The Wild Iris. Telemachus has learned that ironists need never be out of work: When I was a child looking at my parents' lives, you know what I thought? I thought heartbreaking. Now I think heartbreaking, but also 130</page><page sequence="17">Linda Gregerson insane. Also very funny. ("Telemachus' Detachment" 13) The domestic quarrel, with its soul-destroying pettiness and con- volution, would seem to be inimical to lyric poetry. One of the great tech- nical triumphs of Meadowlands is to have found a form in which the soul- destroying can be transmuted to the spirit-reviving. The genius is not just in the leaving out, though elision is its indispensable method, but also in the undressed, unwashed leaving in: Speak to me, aching heart: what ridiculous errand are you inventing for yourself weeping in the dark garage with your sack of garbage: it is not your job to take out the garbage, it is your job to empty the dishwasher. You are showing off again ... ("Midnight" 26) But Glucks finest formal innovation in this volume is reserved for the structure of domestic dialogue. She tracks the wild non sequitur, the sidestep and the feint, the ambush, the afterthought, the timed delay. As in Penelope's weaving, the thread that seemed to have been dropped resurfaces, having meanwhile lent its tensile continuity to the underside of the narrative. How could the Giants name that place the Meadowlands? It has about as much in common with a pasture as would the inside of an oven. New Jersey was rural. They want you to remember that. Simms was not a thug. LT was not a thug. What I think is we should look at our surroundings realistically, for what they are in the present. That's what I tell you about the house. 131</page><page sequence="18">The Kenyon Review No giant would talk the way you talk. You'd be a nicer person if you were a fan of something. When you do that with your mouth you look like your mother. You know what they are? Kings among men. So what king fired Simms? ("Meadowlands 3" 34) Ten such dialogue poems appear in the course of Meadowlancls, eleven if one counts, and one should, the epigraph. All are distinguished by the same minimalist annotation-the woman speaking in indented stanzas, the man flush left-and by a handful of recurrent themes. Once the convention and the leitmotifs have established themselves, the poet is free to begin and end in heady, hilarious medias res: three bare lines and a single speaker in "Meadowlands 2," another single speaker in "Void." No matter that the partner in speech is silent for the moment: these poems are cast as rejoinders and thus take part in a two-part song. Their work- ings are in situ, inseparable from the tonal and semantic resource of the book. Given the theme of the book, of course, this indissolubility of the whole achieves no little poignance. And greatly to its credit, it achieves delight. The reader is granted the pleasures of an initiate, one who knows the players without a scorecard, and the pleasures of an exuberant pace. No small prize to rescue from the ashes. 5. One Let's play choosing music. Favorite form. Opera. Favorite work. Figaro. No. Figaro and Tannhauser. Now it's your turn: sing one for me. (Epigraph to Meadowlands ix) 132</page><page sequence="19">Linda Gregerson Mozart's is a comic opera of marriage. Wagner's is a tragic romance, in which the hero philanders and the heroine dies of a broken heart. Sing one, says the hero: make the one tradition comprehensive. Do the different voices, and make them add up to a whole. Sing for me: make me miss you when I am gone. "[A] figure for/ the part," said Noah in an earlier book. "[N]ot," he said, "the whole" ("Matins" 2). But his subject was the happy heart. Part of the wit that unites these books is their tracing of great epic themes- Milton's in the first instance, Homer's in the second- to their origins in the domestic. By means of this tracing they continue the logic already inherent in their lofty predecessors. But the latterday garden and the meadowlands share another logic too, a logic more specific to the lyric. They posit conversation in a fertile world: my part, yours, the whole mak- ing more than the sum of its parts. And always they hear the conversation breaking down, the answer reduced to echo, the several voices to one. "The beloved doesn't / need to live," says the weaver in equal parts grim- ness and joy. "The beloved / lives in the head" ("Ithaca" 12). Note 1The Telegonia (sixth century B.C..) takes its name trom Telegonus, son of Odysseus and Circe. On the structural kinship and durable erotic powers of rival women, this lost epic was apparently superb: its plot is said to have included the ultimate marriage of Circe to Telemachus and Penelope to Telegonus, two mothers to two sons. Odysseus had by this time succumbed. Works Cited Glick, Louise. Meadowlands. Hopewell, NJ: Ecco Press. 1996. ---. The Wild Iris. Hopewell, NJ: Ecco Press, 1992.
