<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Clay to Stone: Monumentality and Traditionalism in Volterran Urns ROMAN ROTH Abstract Representations of vases are remarkably common in Volterran urn sculpture of the second and early first cen turies B.C.E. Among these, the closely related shapes of the bell and calyx kraters stand out. Not only do they oc cur much more frequently than representations of other vessel types on the front reliefs of the sculpted urns, they were also reproduced as monumental versions of ceramic kraters that were used as funerary urns. On the sculpted urns, the motif of the calyx/bell krater is limited to two specific types of scene: the Abduction of Helen and the somewhat obscure scena del vaso net mezzo ("scene with a vase in the middle"). Because calyx/bell kraters had commonly been used as ash urns since the fourth century B.C.E., this article argues that the choice to represent clay vases in the more monumental medium of stone sculpture should be regarded as a deliberate cultural statement. The intimate association between the kraters and burial in Volterra meant that their inclusion in a mythological scene on an urn relief helped relate the narrative spe cifically to the rite of passage of the deceased individual. Even more important, however, are the tensions between cultural conservatism and aspiration that are revealed by the representation of ceramic kraters either as stone burial urns or on stone burial urns. While the increasing adoption of sculpted urns by elites betrayed their desire for monumental display, the re-creation of increasingly obsolete and distinctly humbler clay urns in the new me dium suggests a social conservatism, as a result of which traditional ritual customs were idealized.* introduction: VOLTERRAN urns and social history Urn sculpture provides a major body of evidence for the cultural history of Etruria during the Hellenis tic period (fourth-first centuries B.C.E.). More than 1,000 examples of sculpted urns survive from the the northern Etruscan city of Volterra and its surrounding territory.1 As elsewhere in those parts of Etruria where cremation was the norm during the Hellenistic period (i.e., chiefly the cities of the north and their territo ries) , Volterran urns most often follow a basic design: a casket decorated with relief panels on the front and sides and covered by an anthropomorphic lid repre senting the deceased in a reclining position. This form of burial had begun to evolve during the later fourth century B.C.E. and reached its qualitative and quantita tive peak during the subsequent two centuries before slowly falling into disuse toward the middle of the first century B.C.E.2 Alongside the canonical type of sculpted ash urn, however, Volterran sculptors also produced less com mon varieties, including the small group of sculpted stone urns in the shape of bell or calyx kraters from around the middle of the second century B.C.E. (figs. 1, 2).3 In her publication of the examples known to * The Urversion of this paper was presented at the Accordia Research Seminar.

I would like to thank all of these friends and colleagues here and stress that I am entirely responsible for any errors that may remain. 1 The collection of the Museo Guarnacci in Volterra ac counts for the majority of known Volterran urns (see Cristo fani 1977,9-18 [a history of the collection by E. Fiumi]; Cateni 1986). Cristofani et al. (1975) list most Volterran urns (both in the Museo Guarnacci and elsewhere) of known provenance by tomb context. Substantial collections of Volterran urns also exist in Berlin, Florence, Leiden, and London, most of which are taken into account by Brunn and K?rte (1870-1916); but see Pairault (1972) and van der Meer (1977-1978) for some important additions to the pieces listed by Brunn and K?rte 1870-1916. For the collecting and collections of urns across Europe, see Cristofani et al. 1975, 9-20 (Cristofani's intro duction, with further references). For concordances between these different corpora, see the individual entries in Urne volt errane (Cristofani et al. 1975; Cristofani 1977; Cateni 1986), as well as the more recent work by Steuernagel (1998), which is, however, limited to urns (not exclusively from Volterra) de picting scenes of Menschenopfer and Mord am Altar. The three volumes of Urne volterraneare the only substantial publications that describe and illustrate each urn in its entirety, including (wherever possible) the lid sculpture and the frontal and side reliefs. 2 Anthropomorphic lid sculpture and elaborate relief deco ration evolved gradually, peaking in the second century B.C.E. Unfortunately, many lids have become dissociated from their caskets over the years. 3 The ceramic varieties with (calyx kraters) and without handles (bell kraters) seem to have been used interchange ably. In this paper, I refer to the shape as "calyx/bell kraters." 39 American Journal of Archaeology 113 (2009) 39-56</page><page sequence="2">40 ROMAN ROTH [AJA 113 Fig. 1. Reconstructed profile of a sculpted alabaster krater (after Venuti 1991, fig. 1). date, Venuti was able to show conclusively that these objects closely imitate clay vessels that had been used as containers for cremations for several centuries.4 This relatively rare phenomenon (Venuti's corpus consists of only four examples) becomes more sig nificant in light of another more widespread pattern in the sculptural representation of vases: reliefs on second-century urns of the canonical type frequently depict pottery shapes that were used as cinerary urns in Volterran tombs.5 In this article, I explore these pat terns in the context of Etruscan elite ideology during the Hellenistic period. Following a detailed analysis of the material evidence (both sculptural and ceramic), I argue that the selective, sculptural representation of funerary vessels created a deliberate reference to tra ditional funerary practices that were no longer used in elite burials. This, I suggest, fits in with a central theme in the behavior of the Volterran elites, which is corroborated by other sources: a tendency toward innovative forms of competitive, monumental display in the funerary and other spheres, as exemplified by the use of elaborate sculpted urns. Coupled with this is a socially conservative ideology, as expressed through the symbolic use of their traditional, yet less showy, ceramic equivalents. The ritual behavior of the Volt erran elites thus illustrates how the tension between collective values and social status was constantly ne gotiated in the ritual commemoration of individuals across Etruria during the Hellenistic period. As in any discussion of Etruscan burial practices, it is worth remembering that not even a burial in a sim ply decorated or even plain container is likely to have been available to everyone across the social scale. A vis ible burial is usually an indicator of elevated status in the ancient world, and there is no reason why Etruria should be an exception.6 The existence of different containers for the ashes of the deceased provides clear evidence for social differentiation within the group that could afford visible burial. On the basis of the available evidence, it is impossible to test the signifi cance of these patterns with regard to factors such as gender and age. Because sculpted urns must have been much more expensive (and much more conspicuous) than ceramic kraters, however, it is reasonable to as sume that the decision to use a stone container reflects a greater ability to invest in a lavish burial.7 Generally speaking, sculpted stone urns offered a more elabo rate, expensive means of status representation than 4Venutil991. 5 Venuti (1991) discusses this parallel at some length with out discussing its cultural implications any further. 6 In general, see the fundamental discussion by Morris (1987, ch. 1). In Etruria, even the simplest rock-cut tombs would have required a considerable amount of labor input, let alone access to the confined spaces of the cemeteries. 7 Some family tombs contained both types of urn. This points to patterns of differentiation within the burying group and also provides an indication of whether a member of the family had died rich or poor. Therefore, the type of urn may also reflect the esteem in which he or she was held by de scendants, depending on the contribution the deceased had made to their collective status. For instance, the large tomb published by Cristofani (1975) contained both sculpted and ceramic urns (bell and calyx kraters), without any clear chron ological distinction (both were used throughout the second and during the early first centuries B.C.E.). Unfortunately, none of the burials in the ceramic urns could be sexed or aged, either on the basis of osteological data or through ex ternal evidence. Should a broader sample become available in the future, such important questions could be approached, for example, through correspondence analysis. See Nielsen (1987, 1989, 2002) for some important observations with re gard to how gender and lineage affected inclusion in and ex clusion from formal clan burials across Etruria; cf. Coarelli's (1972) observations regarding the Tomb of the Scipiones at Rome. Positive contributions to the family's status, however defined, are certain to have played a significant part in being considered worthy of commemoration.</page><page sequence="3">2009] MONUMENTALITY AND TRADITIONALISM IN VOLTERRAN URNS 41 ceramic containers. For this reason, it is remarkable that such vases should have assumed a symbolic value in Volterran urn sculpture. VOLTERRAN KRATERS: THE SCULPTURAL DIMENSION Representations of ceramic vessels appear frequendy on sculpted Volterran urns. They occur in two forms: (1) as actual, monumental copies of earthenware vessels and used as cinerary urns; and, much more frequently, (2) as objects illustrated on the reliefs of sculpted cist urns. While kraters are not the only fu nerary shapes depicted on urns in such a way, I argue that the sculptors treated them as a distinct category tied to specific iconographic themes. Four ash urns sculpted in the shape of monumen tal vases?two in alabaster and two in tuff? have been published (see figs. 1, 2) .8 The largest of these is 81 cm high, including the lid, and 56.6 cm in diameter, while the smallest is 41.1 cm tall and 22.4 cm wide. Traces of paint suggest that these vessels were originally deco rated, though it is impossible to reconstruct this deco ration in detail.9 Only one of the vessels can be dated securely to the mid second century B.C.E. (see fig. 2) ,10 and it is possible, though by no means certain, that this provides an approximate chronology for this entire group of artifacts. The stone urns closely imitate the shape of the calyx/bell krater, with a pedestaled foot, wide belly, a relatively long, open neck (in some cases covered by a lid), and with horizontal handles that are closely attached to the lower half of the vessel. These ceramic vases were frequently used as ash urns in Volt erran burials during the Hellenistic period. CULTURAL CHOICES: KRATERS AND OTHER VASES ON ETRUSCAN URN RELIEFS The second group presents a particular iconological challenge, since representations of vases on Etruscan urn reliefs are not rare, nor are they limited to kraters or other funerary shapes. Generally speaking, Volter ran urn sculptors, much more than their counterparts in other Etruscan cities, had a penchant for represent ing vases with considerable attention to detail. Indeed, the stone vases studied by Venuti are remarkably faithful, monumental copies of the calyx/bell kraters found in many Volterran burials. A comparable degree of precision is detectable in the depiction of vases in general, on both the front and the side relief panels of sculpted urns of the canonical type. Fig. 2. Inscribed lid of a sculpted alabaster krater from the Tomb of the Luvisu, second century B.C.E. (after Cristofani 1975, no. 3). In my first catalogue (appx. 1), representations of vases are listed according to their findspots, the kind of scene in which they occur, and the vessel type that is depicted, based on Brunn and K?rte's corpus of Etruscan urn reliefs.11 Even though this does not in clude more recent finds, it does provide an internally consistent, statistical basis for comparing the popular ity of the main scenes found on Etruscan urns by city of origin. According to the Brunn and K?rte sample, there are 54 urns from Volterra and its territory that depict vases on their front relief panels, 15 examples from Perugia and its surroundings, 7 from Chiusi and its hinterland, 2 of uncertain provenance, and 1 from Cortona and its territory. Volterran urn reliefs exhibit at least 9 different vessel types; only 6 varieties are found on Perugian urns, 4 on Chiusine, and 1 on a Cortonian urn.12 This suggests that a variety of vases were popu lar motifs, especially on Volterran urns. In addition, some vessel types seem to have been significantly more popular among Volterran urn sculptors than others; for example, on Volterran urns, the calyx/bell krater is by far the most frequently shown vessel type, accounting for 31 examples. Moreover, only two types of scene ac count for 27 of these representations; the Abduction of Helen (fig. 3) appears on 19 examples and the so called scena del vaso nel mezzo ("scene with a vase in the middle") (fig. 4) on 8. No other vessel type shown on Etruscan urns corre lates as specifically to particular scenes as do the krat ers, with the minor exceptions of the drinking vessels found on the Volterran banqueting/suitor scenes ?Venuti 1991. 9Venutil991,39. 10Cristofani et al. 1975, 3 (from the Tomb of the Luvisu); cf.

In these two cases, however, the presence of specific vessel types has straightforward, functional explanations in the narrative context of the scene. This is especially ob vious in the banqueting scenes that call for appropriate tableware and may also apply to the sacrificial scenes in which pouring vessels fulfill ritual functions. The same cannot be said of the kraters, for whatever may be happening in the scena del vaso nel mezzo, the krater holds no obvious functional significance.13 It could have been replaced with another vessel, so its consis tent appearance in these scenes must be cultural. In the Abduction of Helen scene, the krater may stand for the possessions that Paris robs when he abducts her.14 There is, however, no obvious reason why this repre sentation should consistently involve a krater rather than any other large vase. By contrast, the commercial amphoras (as indicated by their pointed base) shown in a few examples of the Helen reliefs seem to have an obvious narrative function: a ship is being loaded in preparation for a long journey with amphoras that are specifically designed for this purpose. The krater has no such obvious function, yet it appears in the major ity of these scenes. In the Abduction of Helen and the scena del vaso nel mezzo reliefs, therefore, it is probable that the central position of the krater itself imposes a specific meaning on the scenes. Thus, urn sculptors, particularly at Volterra, were very much aware of the morphological differences be tween the vessels they chose to represent. Especially where the vases do not serve any obvious function within the narrative of the scene, the sculptors' choice to depict them reflects culturally specific and context dependent symbolic meanings. Although it is possible that the representation of specific (or narrow ranges of) shapes in particular scenes reflects what appeared in template drawings used by Etruscan urn sculptors, the choice to produce typologically accurate presen tations must have been (at least initially) a conscious one. It is, furthermore, important to note that such "ty pologies" were internalized and had contextual asso Fig. 5. Sacrifice of Iphigenia on the front relief of a Volterran urn, second century B.C.E. Note the pouring vessel above the victim's head (after Brunn and K?rte 1870-1916, 1:XLIV). ciations: the craftsmen are unlikely to have conceived of ceramic shapes in terms of externally imposed clas sificatory systems, in the way modern archaeologists might. Rather, the morphological differences?some more than others?mattered to them because they car ried meaning within the specific contexts in which the pots were used and could be observed.15 They repre sented artifactual categories that depended on cultural knowledge, not on the kind of objectified, typological hierarchies imposed by an external observer.16 There is another pattern visible in the representation of specific vessels in specific positions on the funerary urns: the reliefs on the short sides of many Volte rran urns depict amphoras by themselves. In my second cata logue (appx. 2), these amphoras are listed with type of vase and the scene on the frontal relief of the urn. On this list, I use the label "elaborate" amphora to refer to a vessel that appears on the sides of the urns and has a high, pedestaled foot and a lid (figs. 6-8). In contrast to most of the kraters, however, they feature a more 13 One suggestion is that the scene depicts the drawing of lots to decide the fate of the nude male figure shown on the right. 14 This is also suggested by Brunn and K?rte 1870-1916. It is, moreover, interesting to note that Brunn and K?rte con sistently refer to the vase type shown in the Helen and "vase" scenes as "cratere." Other scholars (as throughout the Urne volterrane [Cristofani 1977; Cristofani etal. 1975; Cateni 1986] but with the notable exception of Venuti 1991) tend to use the less precise (and, in these cases, incorrect) "anfora." 15 It is interesting to note, furthermore, that several vessel types are regularly shown on top of columns, usually in scenes of sacrifice or, generically, "death by the altar," and sometimes in what has been interpreted as the raiding of sanctuaries. In these cases, the combination of column and vessel (not of a consistently specific shape) may be shorthand for a ritual space and thus symbolize the sacred order of the scene, which is being transgressed by the slaying of humans or the military attack; cf. Steuernagel (1998), who does not comment on this particular iconographic device. 16 The work of Miller (1985) is fundamental in this regard.

In addition, their bodies are usually ribbed, their handles are elabo rately curved, ending in volutes, and they are without exception covered by a lid. These features make it likely that they represent either metal (toreutic) vases or their ceramic imitations. This makes good sense at Volterra, the location of a ceramic tradition that specialized in toreutic shapes, which frequently made it into tomb assemblages as grave goods, though not usually as ash containers.17 They are best known in their black-gloss incarnation and,18 with one possible exception, are not depicted interchangeably with the kraters (cat. no. 8) ,19 Again, this lends support to the hypothesis that Volt erran urn sculptors made informed, specific choices when depicting ceramic vases and that those choices were culturally determined. Why might there have been such a typological dis tinction, broadly speaking, between vessels shown on the side panels of urns and those depicted as part of front-panel relief scenes or monumentally reproduced in stone? The key is to discern how these three modes of representation differ, specifically in their relation to the deceased. I argue that the krater is reserved for modes of sculptural representation that engage with the role of the deceased in culturally specific ways, while the "elaborate" amphoras on the side panels have a more generic, funerary symbolism. In both cases, however, we are dealing with references to an idealized funerary ritual that included such vases. TYPES AND CHRONOLOGY OF CERAMIC KRATERS The shape of the calyx/bell krater imitated in stone and represented on the front panels of Volterran urns emerges at about the middle of the fourth century B.C.E., at about the same time as the better-known red-figure column kraters (kelebai).20 Although they are rarely found as sculptural representations,21 these column kraters clearly document the custom of using ceramic vessels as cinerary urns. Indeed, both calyx/ bell and column kraters, often preserved with their lids, are commonly found in burials in the necropoleis of Volterra, as well as in parts of its large territory.22 17 Only one exception to this rule is known to me, namely the column kraters shown on the sides of Cristofani et al. 1975, 163 (Brunn and K?rte 1870-1916, 3:no. LXX.4c); calyx/ bell kraters never occur in this schema (see appx. 2). Con versely, column kraters?although they had been an early form of ceramic urns?are never shown on the front panels (see appx. 1). 18 For the range of shapes, many of which are toreutic, see the fundamental publication by Pasquinucci (1972) of the black-gloss wares from Volterran tombs in the Museo Guar nacci (esp. no. 279 [ forma 142, "elaborate" amphora]; no. 283 [forma 134, "elaborate" amphora]; nos. 286, 287 [forma 40, calyx krater]; no. 288 [forma 139, bell krater]; no. 289 [for ma 136, column krater]; no. 529 [forma 135, "elaborate" am phora]). Most of these and other closely related shapes form part of the especes 4630 and 4640 of Morel's (1981) standard typology of black-gloss pottery. Shefton (1998) offers an illu minating discussion of the metallic pedigree of some of these shapes, including the calyx krater. 19 The possible exception is the urn of Velia Cerinei from Castiglioncello; see Roth (2005) for a discussion and further references regarding the cultural context of this urn. It is list ed neither by Brunn and K?rte (1870-1916) nor in the Urne volterranebut is taken into account in Nielsen's (1992) study of mythological representations on Volterran urns. I have decid ed to include it here for the sake of completeness, especially since it exposes a potential weakness of my argument, which, however, I regard as an exception to the rule, not as a substan tive detraction. 20 The red-figure kelebai are particularly well known. Pas quinucci's catalogue lists more than 30 examples from Volt erra itself, only three of which, however, can be traced back to securely identifiable burial contexts (Pasquinucci 1968, 17-21). To this should be added an unknown number of un published vessels, which may include a substantial amount of fragmentary material. Like the calyx/bell kraters, the kelebai are more commonly found in black-gloss and plain ware (Pas quinucci 1968,4 n. 21). 21 Supra n. 17. 22 In addition, several examples of Volterran kelebai have</page><page sequence="7">2009] MONUMENTALITY AND TRADITIONALISM IN VOLTERRAN URNS 45 U Fig. 7.

During the earlier part of the third century B.C.E., the kraters (and the red-figure style) gradually fall out of use as cinerary urns.23 In tombs from the third to the early first centuries B.C.E., however, this shape is usually found in plain or overpainted styles of medio cre to poor quality.24 The continuing funerary use of such kraters could have reflected the poverty of the deceased, his or her lack of esteem within the familial group?as is probable when kraters and stone urns were contemporaneously used in the same tombs?or a combination of the two. Sculpted stone (alabaster and tuff) urns, by contrast, became the burial container of choice for higher-status burials. Sculpted urns gradu ally came to be produced in a wide range of qualities and thus became available to a wider sector of Volter ran society. Competitive emulation provides a plausible explanation for this, and it has been suggested that a comparable process was responsible for the spread of urn sculpture from Volterra across its territory.25 By contrast, the traditional, ceramic form of burial in ceramic containers decreased in importance and con tinued only in burials of lower status.26 It is therefore perplexing that the vessels used for this inconspicuous, largely rejected custom seem to have assumed a symbolic value among those who used sculpted urns. Perhaps urn sculptors simply depicted been found further afield in Etruria and beyond, as part of the wide diffusion enjoyed by Volterran pottery in general during the fourth and third centuries B.C.E.; see Pasquinucci 1968, 1-5; cf. Pasquinucci 1972; Frontini 1984. It is not clear wheth er these vessels were also used as ash urns outside Volterra and its territory. 23 For the chronology of the red-figure kelebai, see Dohrn (1937, 120) and Pasquinucci (1968, 6-10, 17-28). It should not be excluded that this morphological reduction is in it self culturally meaningful. However, it is impossible?at least on the basis of the available data?to approach this potential meaning in any systematic fashion. 24The examples listed by Cristofani (1975) are dated to the second century B.C.E. See Venuti (1991, 41 n. 9) for discus sion and further references. 25 Barker and Rasmussen 1998, 289; Maggiani 1999; cf. Miller (1982) for a theoretical discussion of competitive emu lation as a cultural phenomenon. 26 There is a certain risk in underestimating the frequency of ceramic kraters in Volterran burials. Few Volterran tombs were excavated and published as conscientiously as the ex ample cited earlier (Cristofani 1975; see Venuti [1991, 41 n. 18] for further references to several more recendy excavated examples, which I have not been able to locate). Thus, frag ments of kraters may have been overlooked and discarded in some cases.</page><page sequence="8">46 ROMAN ROTH [AJA 113 the "real" kraters they knew, which would explain the prevalence of calyx/bell kraters over kelebai in sculp tural representations.27 Thus, they depicted a ceramic krater that was used for the deposition of cremated ashes and that would have resonated with viewers as belonging to the iconographical context of Volterran funerals. KRATERS AS FUNERARY SYMBOLS The evolution of this iconography is illustrated by one of the red-figure column kraters published by Pasquinucci.28 One of the two decorated sides of this piece depicts a column krater in detail, including the painted decoration. This is the first time in the context of Volterran funerary iconography that a type of vase used exclusively in burial contexts has become an ap propriate motif for the decoration of an urn that, in this case, is typologically identical to it. This tradition continues on later stone urns that show calyx/bell krat ers, the only pottery shapes that were still being used as containers for the ashes of deceased Volterrans. In this way, the ceramic ash urn continues to appear on containers?or, in the four cases of monumental kraters, as the very containers themselves?that have the same function but are instead made of stone. The innovative medium of urn sculpture thus attaches symbolic value to a comparatively inexpensive type of vessel, which it has largely replaced. Why, then, did the sculptors make a representa tional choice that seems to run counter to the pro cesses of competitive emulation, a process that is documented by the simultaneous preference for stone funerary urns? I suggest that we are dealing here with a deliberate reference to an idealized burial custom that highlights certain tensions between traditional ism and innovation in Volterran elite society. Simi larly, why were kraters selected for representation in the specific iconographical context of the Abduction of Helen scenes and the scena del vaso nel mezzo} The key to this is not simply that the krater was customar ily encountered in funerary contexts but that as the urns containing the ashes of the deceased, they must have been the centerpieces of a burial29?a centrality that is perhaps mirrored by their placement on the urns. By contrast, the "elaborate" amphoras occupy a secondary rank, both in function and in iconography: they commonly appear in burials (but as grave goods rather than as the ash urn itself) and in the reliefs on Volterran urns. In urn sculpture, they commonly ap pear in secondary positions on the sides of urns and almost never on the front reliefs. Most of the "elaborate" amphoras share distinctly toreutic features, such as a ribbed body or volute han dles, that suggest they are meant to represent metal vessels or at least clay imitations of metal vases. Such vases are commonly found at Volterra, above all from tomb assemblages. Although it is impossible to decide whether the vessels shown on the urns represent met al or clay vases, plate is relatively rarely preserved in tombs, and the proficiency of the Malacena potters at reproducing toreutic shapes means that evidence from Volterra may support Vickers and Gill's theory that ceramic production replaced metal by providing rela tively inexpensive versions of metal shapes for funer ary contexts.30 Closed, toreutic shapes, including those such as the "elaborate" amphoras, become increasingly rare in the repertoire of Volterran black-gloss produc tions during the second century B.C.E.31 It is possible that they reflect metal vessels that were used during the funeral but were not normally deposited in the tomb because of their value. Indeed, the morphology of the vases suggests that they might have been used for the storage and pouring of oil or ointments, in which case they could have been reused during subsequent ceremonies. There is, however, nothing to indicate a specific and unique role for these amphoras in the fu nerary context; this distinguishes them from imitations and from the kraters, since the latter were definitely used as ash urns, and only one of them is ever shown in each narrative scene. The "elaborate" amphoras thus stood as generic markers for the funerary context. This practice finds parallels in other ancient cultures. Monumental, mar ble versions of lekythoi and loutrophoroi, for example, 27Venuti (1991) postulates a (perhaps excessively) close typological correspondence between real and sculpted examples. 28Pasquinuccil968, 30. 29 This would also be the case with stone urns, including the imitation kraters. 30Vickers and Gill 1994. See Shefton (1998) for a specific discussion of several Volterran shapes and their metal pedi gree. Metal vessels (esp. bronze) are, however, too frequently found in tombs?both in Volterra and elsewhere in Etruria? as to validate Vickers and Gill's theory comprehensively. Con versely, elaborate black-gloss vessels are certainly known from settlement and sanctuary contexts in Volterra (Palermo 2003; di Giuseppe 2005). This corroborates the results of Reusser's (2001) study of the distribution of (Greek) painted pottery in Etruscan sanctuaries and settiements during the Archaic period (see also the contributions to Bentz and Reusser 2004; Spivey2007). 31 Morel 1981, 409-530; cf. my discussion in Roth 2007, 47-8.

Like the Volterran kraters, the normal-sized clay versions of these vases were typi cally associated with burials and may have been needed for the proper completion of the ritual.32 But neither the Athenian lekythos nor the loutrophoros had as intimate an association with the deceased and as cen tral a role in the funerary ritual as did the Volterran kraters that contained the ashes of the deceased. Fur thermore, in Athens, such monumental stone vessels did not necessarily mark a specific grave but usually had a more generally commemorative and decora tive function within a burial plot.33 The representa tion of the lekythos or loutrophoros in Athenian art, therefore, reinforced the typical ritual context of the vessels, suggesting to the culturally informed viewer that a customary ritual, such as the pouring of oil, had been conducted. THE IDEALIZED CREMATION There are, however, two crucial differences between the Athenian and Volterran scenarios. First, the Volt erran kraters represent both the central rite of the funeral and the actual subject of the ritual, since the kraters held the deceased's ashes.34 It is plausible that the appearance of the Abduction of Helen on Volter ran urns represents the transition of the deceased to the world of death and is thus a particularly powerful version of the theme of farewell, which is so familiar from Etruscan iconography.35 The inclusion of one (and only one) krater among Helen's possessions adds poignancy to the mythological scene by alluding to the Volterran funeral in general and in particular to the funeral of the deceased whose ashes are held within the urn itself. What additional layers of meaning the scena del vaso nel mezzo may convey is much less clear. But the krater, being situated in an aedicule at the center of the scene, represents the focal point of what appears to be some kind of ritual interaction, the subject of which might be the transition of the deceased to the under world. If, as has been argued, the scene represents the drawing of lots from an urn to decide the deceased's fate, the krater would then be at the center of the tran sition from life to death. Broadly speaking, therefore, the presence of a krater in both types of scene seems both to make them particularly relevant to Volterran funerals and to connect the scenes specifically with the person whose ashes are held within the urn. Second, and most important, the stone kraters or the images of kraters on stone urns represent a spe cific form of cremation that involved placing the ashes in a ceramic container. This had, by the time of the stone urns, become a minority custom. The fundamen tal questions arising from this are why the Volterran elites began to use sculpted urns and why it was desir able for them to refer symbolically to their previous funerary custom. In the next section, I address these tensions between idealized (represented) and real custom, between tradition and innovation as part of a more widely documented cultural discourse among the Volterran elites. MONUMENTS, TRADITION, AND ELITE IDEOLOGY The very introduction of sculpted urns during the fourth century B.C.E. constitutes a marked change in the material culture and ritual practices of Volterran society. Few scholars working in this well-tilled field of Etruscan archaeology are interested in this profound change other than trying to trace the (probably ex ternal) source of inspiration for the adoption of this form of burial container. This point of view dominates, for example, the debate over the stylistic and thematic changes in the urns, both in their relief decoration and the sculptural representation of the deceased on their lids.36 Although the issue of origins is important, all too often it has led scholars to overlook the internal social reasons behind the adoption of the urn burial at Volterra and elsewhere. The influence of Hellenis tic culture may help explain why sculpted urns and 32 This ritual prescription is strongly suggested by the fact that lekythoi are even found in tomb assemblages dating to the period between ca. 480 and 430 B.C.E., when sumptuary legislation concerning funerary expenditure seems to have been particularly strict (cf. Morris 1994). Bergemann (1996) convincingly argues against the common assumption that the later monumental marble loutrophoroi were specifically asso ciated with unmarried male deceased: like the lekythoi (and the Volterran "elaborate" amphoras), these vessels seem to symbolize the completion of an idealized ritual. 33 Schmaltz 1970, 76-83; Stears 2000, 210. But a few cases in which marble lekythoi unambiguously refer to individual burials are also attested (Schmaltz 1970, 79). 34 Along a similar line of argument, Pallottino (1952, 44) proposed to interpret the krater painted on the tympanon of the Tarquinian Tomba delle Leonesse as a representation of the deceased and his (or her) funeral. Spivey (2007, 238-39 n. 25 [with further references]) has recently argued against this interpretation, pointing to the symposiastic theme of the tomb's iconography. Although Spivey's objections are con vincing, one could also imagine a more ambiguous scenario that might accommodate both readings. 351 have argued this elsewhere (Roth 2005). To the bibli ography listed there, Steiner's (2004) study of processions in Etruscan funerary iconography should now be added. 36 E.g., Small 1981; cf. Steuernagel (1998) and De Ange lis (2001) for alternative approaches. Steuernagel (1998, ch. 1), moreover, provides a superb overview of the Wissenschafts geschichte of urn iconology.</page><page sequence="10">48 ROMAN ROTH [AJA 113 sarcophagi appear in Etruria around this time.37 But it must not blind us to the possibility that the intro duction of a new form of burial points to a potentially significant pattern of sociocultural change as well. The replacement of ceramic urns by sculpted stone urns marks, in the first instance, an increasing monu mentalization of Volterran burials. Next to nothing is known about the rites involved in the funeral ceremo ny, but it would not be far-fetched to imagine that at some point during the ceremony, the urn containing the ashes of the deceased was on display. Similarly, the urn could have been seen later during commemora tive ceremonies or later burials when the tomb would have been opened and accessible to all or part of the burying group.38 That later visitors to Etruscan tombs could actually see the decoration and objects inside is attested archaeologically by, for example, the hooks in the ceilings of the Frangois tomb at Vulci and the Tomb of the Volumnii at Perugia, from which lamps may have been hung.39 The experience of viewing the urn inside the tomb would have radically differed from the experience during the funeral itself or during the production of the urn, but there is no reason to assume that these subsequent viewers were not attuned to the iconography on the urns and its various meanings. At any rate, the main function of the urn was commem orative, as expressed by the iconography of the urn reliefs, the anthropomorphic lids, and, in some cases, inscriptions. By including the deceased relative in a family tomb and commemorating him or her with an elaborate, ostentatiously individualizing urn, the fam ily or clan members made an idealized statement about their identity as a group of elite agents.40 As part of a wider cultural process, the monumental ization of the burial rite is paralleled in the townscape of Volterra.41 During the fourth century B.C.E., a ring of high walls was built around the city, enclosing an area that was considerably larger than that of its me dieval successor. During the following two centuries, monumental gates were added. The most famous of these is the Porta all Arco, with its distinctive archway adorned with the sculpted heads of what may have represented a divine triad. This monumentalization of the Volterran townscape reached its zenith during the last quarter of the third and the first quarter of the second centuries B.C.E. with the construction of two temples on the acropolis.42 As has been argued for other central Italian towns during this period, these architectural developments reflect a self-fashioning of local, urban identity, driven by elites who were in creasingly outward looking.43 This is documented, for example, by the development of settlements along the coast (e.g., at Castiglioncello) in an area of Volterran influence, if not Volterran territory proper, begin ning in the late fourth century B.C.E. This suggests an increasing interest by Volterran elites in interacting with other parts of the peninsula, and precisely at the time when Rome's incipient rise to Italian hegemony became a catalyst for elite interaction across the pen insula in both cultural and economic spheres.44 37 See, e.g., the contributions to Zanker 1976; Holliday 2002. 38 In addition, the issue of the visibility of (sculpted) funer ary monuments in Etruria does not depend solely on the final destination of those monuments. Indeed, leaving aside the funerary ceremony (about which next to nothing is known but during which those present doubtless had an opportu nity to look at the monument), it is very probable that craft production was a publicly visible activity. The quarrying of the stone, as well as the production and transport of the sculpted urns, would have involved a large number of people; produc tion was a noisy business, and may thus have been part of the daily experience of most urban dwellers. Although it is impos sible to reconstruct such nonfunerary contexts of viewing and to assess how they might have affected the interpretation of sculpture designed for the funerary sphere, it is reasonable to assume that the iconography of the urns, including symbols such as the krater, had a currency beyond the burying group and across a wide social scale. 39 Cf. Steuernagel 1998, 138 n. 831. But it should be not ed that both tombs are exceptional in their structure and size, as well as (in the case of the Francois tomb) in their iconography. 40 On the emergence of a clan-based elite in Etruria, cf., e.g., Cristofani 1986,145-56; Torelli 1986,70; Barker and Ras mussen 1998, 286; Nielsen 2002. Terrenato (2001a) argues for the existence of powerful clan groups before the Helle nistic period. While I am happy to accept this, it is undeniable that the Hellenistic period sees an unprecedented emphasis on the definition of individual and group statuses in relation to one another?not only in Etruria but also at Rome and else where in central Italy (see contributions to Pugliese Carattelli 1990 [esp. the paper by La Rocca]; see also H?lscher 1978; 1990; Holliday 2002 [but cf. the reviews by H?lkeskamp 2005; H?lscher 2005]; Walter 2004). 41 See a more in-depth discussion in Roth 2007, ch. 6 (with further references). In addition, see the catalogue of the ex hibition Artigianato artistico (Maggiani 1985) for an overview of the flourishing of Volterran craft production in many dif ferent spheres during the Hellenistic period. 42Cristofani 1973; Colonna 1985; Bonamici 2003. 43Zanker's (1990,1998) work on the archaeology of town scapes (Stadtbilder) is fundamental in this respect. Izzet (2007, esp. ch. 6) provides an innovative perspective on the impor tance of (architectural) surfaces to the expression of cultural identity, albeit with a focus on the preceding (Archaic) peri od. Terrenato (1998, 2001b) compellingly argues for the key role played by elite agency in the shaping of local (material) cultures in Hellenistic Etruria. For an innovative approach based on geophysical data, see Millett 2007. 44 For Castiglioncello, see the contributions to Gambogi and Palladino (1999), as well as my own observations (Roth</page><page sequence="11">2009] MONUMENTALITY AND TRADITIONALISM IN VOLTERRAN URNS 49 As an integral part of such elite competition, the funerary commemoration of deceased family mem bers was a crucial ingredient to a family's public status and therefore a worthy expenditure of considerable resources.45 Paradoxically, then, the representation on sculpted urns of ceramic kraters (i.e., the very ves sels that had previously been used as simple cinerary urns) seems to point to a symbolic reversal of these patterns of competition and emulation. The krater now assumed an idealized, semantic value within the context of elite burial, the very sphere from which it had earlier been removed as unsuited to conspicu ous display. At a more general level, this may reflect a desire to create a sense of continuity with traditional burial customs. This is plausible in the specific case of Volterran society which, as shown by the work of Terre nato, was very conservative.46 This cultural conservatism may have caused traditional burial customs to become idealized. If so, any specific reference to these customs would have been part of the idealization of both the de ceased and his or her clan as the burying group. Thus, the burying group was also able to display its awareness of what should form part of a proper burial. In addi tion, the imitation or representation of ceramic kraters would imbue the sculpted urns with a sense of cultural identity, for the kraters would symbolize an idealized burial that was at the same time a specifically Volterran custom. This might explain the special popularity of this symbol during the second century B.C.E., a period characterized by an unprecedented degree of interac tion between the Volterran elites and their peers across Italy.47 The funerary ritual could thus have provided an important context in which the place of Volterran society and its traditions in relation to the widening cultural horizons of Etruria was debated. Thus, the vi sual memorization of clay vases in stone sculpture may be seen as a part of the conscious negotiation between social reality and ideal, between monumental display and the conservation of ritual traditions during one of the most dynamic periods in the cultural history of ancient Italy.
