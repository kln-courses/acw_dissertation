(Hellenistic Culture and Society, 27) Flavius Josephus has long been famous for his first book, The Jewish War, the primary source for the history of the Jews from the Maccabean Revolt to the destruction of the Temple. Less well known is his later history Jewish An- tiquities, but it represents a more accomplished author and involves his own paraphrase of Jewish history found in the Hebrew Scriptures. Feldman addresses two questions to the Jewish Antiquities. First, to what extent has Josephus made his own creative contribution to the biblical history of the Jews? Second, to what extent has Josephus provided a distinguishable and consistent point of view? Feldman seeks to determine how Josephus han- dles source material (where we have his biblical source for comparison), in the hope that this will enable scholars to better evaluate The Jewish War. The book is divided into two parts. The first deals with Josephus as histo-</page><page sequence="2">494 BOOK REVIEWS rian. Portions of this section were published earlier in the volume Mikra of the series Compendia Rerum Iudaicarum ad Novum Testamentum (1988), but the extensive revision and fourfold expansion represent the fruit of Feldman's labor since then. His labor is also found in the second part, which contains twelve "portraits" from a series of previously published studies (newly revised) on ma? jor figures in biblical history: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Samson, Samuel, Saul, David, Solomon, and Daniel. (The other portraits and additional studies have been republished in Studies in Josephus' Rewritten Bible [Brill 1998].) The primary focus of each portrait is the model of the Greek hero, beginning with genealogy and wealth and elaborating on the five virtues. Other subheadings include apologetic and stylistic motifs appropriate to each charac? ter, and Josephus' removal of theological problems and other difficulties. The following remarks will focus on part 1, which distills the themes of each portrait and does so in the broader context of all his portraits. Feldman argues that the historiography of Josephus is based on the school of Isocrates, with its fictitious speeches and epic proportions, and that of Aristotle, with its scientific classification of lives, culminating in the styles of Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Nicolaus of Damascus. As historian, Josephus is more concerned with commenting on the situation of his own day than explain- ing the past. Accordingly, the genre of "apologetic biography" best describes his Jewish Antiquities. In chapter 2, "Josephus as Rewriter of the Bible," Feldman analyzes Jose? phus' dependence on the textual traditions of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Greek Septuagint, and the Aramaic targumim. He concludes that the models of the Septuagint and the targumim most resemble Jewish Antiquities, but Josephus has combined their method with that of Greek historians, most notably of Thu? cydides. Feldman notes that Josephus' self-consciousness of being a prophet and a priest affects his historiography. As a priest, Josephus felt authorized and qualified to interpret the sacred Scriptures. As a prophet, though not of the stature of biblical literary prophets, Josephus is commissioned to play an active role in the politics of his day and to explain the current condition of the Jews in the aftermath of the destruction of their Temple. Chapter 3, "Qualities of Biblical Heroes," provides a thematic synthesis of the different hero studies. The heroes of the Jews are no less noble than the heroes of the Greeks and Romans: their genealogies are illustrious, their births portentous, and their persons endowed with virtuous qualities. Josephus takes great care to exemplify the cardinal virtues (wisdom, courage, temperance, jus? tice, piety) in his encomia of the biblical characters. Chapter 4, "Josephus as Apologist to Non-Jews and to Jews," is perhaps the most interesting to historians and advances Feldman's goal of analyzing The Jewish War. Josephus draws on Gentile sources to establish the historicity of biblical events, even when they disagree with the biblical account. He attrib- utes the evil inflicted on the Jews by most rulers to the bad counsel of advisers</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 495 or the wickedness of the people they rule. He points to civil strife as the funda? mental cause for all the misfortunes and defeats of the Jews throughout their history. The obvious parallel is his description of the civil strife and internecine wars among the Zealots which led to the war against Rome and the destruction of the Temple. As apologist for the Jews, Josephus defends them against the charges of misanthropy and dual loyalties, which involved the difficult issue of Jewish par- ticularism to forestall assimilation and Jewish universalism that encouraged proselytization. The lives of his heroes are his response to the charge that the Jews have contributed no great men to civilization. In the final chapter of part 1, "Stylistic and Other Changes," Feldman fur? ther develops the creativity of Josephus and addresses the second goal of his study: the extent to which Josephus has a distinguishable and consistent point of view. He notes that Josephus sees his work as reordering the biblical account, which Moses left in disarray (owing to the nature of prophetic utterances), and resolves difficult passages either by omitting them or by reinterpreting them for his Gentile audience. For example, he avoids anthropomorphism. In Genesis 1:2, the spirit of God hovers or broods over the waters as if, in Orphic theogony, brooding over a world-egg. Josephus rephrases the passage as "a breath from above sped over" the darkness (AJ 1.27). Feldman marshals numerous inter? esting passages in support of each stylistic motif. He notes that Josephus draws on Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Herodotus, Thucydi? des, Plato, and Aristotle, among fifty-five Greek authors, both for his narrative style and in support of his effort to make Jewish Antiquities as cosmopolitan as possible. Beyond his apologetic aim, Josephus' creativity comes out in his philoso? phy, his moralizing of individual motives, and his rationalizing of the supernat? ural history of the Jews. He favors Stoic philosophy and imbues his heroes with Stoic ideals. He blends his Jewish notion of God's providence with the Stoic emphasis on fate and destiny, until the two are often indistinguishable. He pays considerable attention to moralizing about the true motives of many bibli? cal characters. A primary theme is that envy leads to strife, and strife to sedi- tion, and sedition to calamity. Feldman draws out parallels between the biblical figures and the political machinations that plagued the Jews and Josephus in his day. Feldman devotes considerable space to Josephus' "detheologizing" of the biblical narrative, that is, his deemphasizing the role of God in biblical stories, especially where it raises problems of theodicy or speaks of God's direct in- volvement in the lives of humans and animals. Josephus rationalizes many of the biblical miracle stories, and to avoid a confusion between the biblical angels and the various divine beings of the pagan pantheon, he tends either to omit their reference or to ascribe their work to God himself. In short, according to Feldman, Josephus approaches the Bible as history rather than theology.</page><page sequence="4">496 BOOK REVIEWS Josephus says he has neither added to nor subtracted from the sacred text, so his paraphrase must be seen as consistent with the spirit of the text and not the letter. In this, he follows a long line of authors, both Jewish and Greek, who take great liberties in retelling their revered stories of the past. Despite noting exceptions to nearly every stylistic tendency of Josephus', Feldman con? cludes that Josephus was "generally careful and consistent and... learned much from the classical Greek authors who had preceded him" (220). Scholars can, and will, find areas of disagreement with Feldman's inter? pretation of Josephus' work and person, but a general criticism is the brevity with which he treats opposing views or handles difficult interpretations of Jo? sephus. In challenging other views, his succinct style, reminiscent of his anno- tated bibliographies, will leave many readers unaware of the substance of the problem, and the reader must follow the bibliographic trail for the details. Those who follow Feldman's battle with other scholars over his hermeneutic of trust in ancient sources (i.e., taking them at their word), will find the same argu? ments reviewed (though in an appendix he marshals considerable evidence for a common body of Palestinian tradition available to Josephus, some of which is preserved in rabbinic tradition). Feldman's view of Josephus' consistency is not shared by all. He demon? strates that Josephus often alters the biblical account of wars by inventing the military prowess of the heroes and minimizing the activity of God in the victo? ries (107-8). In his speech to the Zealots in The Jewish War (5.362-419) and elsewhere, however, Josephus repeatedly says that Jews were never known for their military might and never won a battle unless God gave them the victory. He concludes with his famous statement that "invariably have arms been re? fused to our nation, and warfare has been the sure signal for defeat" (BJ 5.399). Although Feldman later refers to the entire speech, here he misses an opportu- nity to address a significant inconsistency, or at least a significant change in Josephus' apologetic approach to Jewish history. He states that Josephus identifies Jewish government by aristocracy with theocracy, or rule by God: "Josephus used the term 'aristocracy' to refer, not to a particular form of government, but rather, as the etymology of the term im? plies, to the government by the best, which for him means rule of G-d, that is, a theocracy" (145 n. 7). The etymological explanation is attractive, and may work elsewhere, but in the passage cited, aristocracy is preferred among other polities (jioXiTeiag), or forms of government, one of which is kingship (AJ 4.223, paraphrasing Deut. 17). As a polity, aristocracy is rule by council, headed by the high priest, and in Josephus' view, as both an aristocrat and a priest, that is the best form of government. In his portrait of Moses (434), Feldman states that kingship cannot be the equivalent of theocracy; but according to Josephus, a king is acceptable in Jewish polity, so long as he acts under the law and with the advice of the council. It would seem that either type of administration could exist under the authority of theocracy, which appears to be a principle of gov-</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 497 ernment?the rule of God over the universe (Ap. 2.185)?and not limited to a specific administrative form. In any case, the nature of theocracy according to Josephus is an issue much debated, and Feldman might have taken the occasion to acknowledge the discussion and point the way to its bibliography. Aside from these minor criticisms of this massive project, we may ac? knowledge the work to be a crowning achievement of the foremost scholar on Josephus. There is a wealth of information in each of the portraits. Feldman has labored long to provided us with an extensive commentary on the most impor? tant ancient history of the Jews, and he has expanded our knowledge of how the Hebrew scriptures were read and enhanced in the first century. The publisher also deserves applause for providing a first-class format. The volume is equipped with footnotes, rather than irritating endnotes, which are a labor-saving device quite unnecessary in the post-Gutenberg era. There are more than 130 pages of indexes, referencing modern scholarship and an? cient sources, including Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Aramaic words. Students of antiquity and classical Judaism will profitably mine this volume for years to Leo Sandgren University of Florida e-mail: sandgren@ufl.edu</page></plain_text>
