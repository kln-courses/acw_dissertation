After describing the means of expression employed by the Palaeolithic artist and comparing them with cer- tain twentieth-century developments, Giedion enters upon an exhaustive study of the symbols used and their meaning. He next considers the sanctity of animal life and primitive man's sense of inferiority to it, the evolution of the earliest sculptures and painting through the Aurignacian-Perigordian and Magdalenian eras, and the great compositions. As might be expected of this author, his final section is devoted to the space composition of prehistory. The second volume opens with a discussion of the contrasting phi- losophies of Mesopotamia and Egypt. It deals cogently with their relative chronologies, the persist- ent development of each culture away from purely animal deities to semi- or wholly anthropomorphic forms, and the importance of sym- bolism. Emphasizing the essential differences between the ziggurat and the pyramid, Giedion proceeds to discuss the development of each, the great temples of Egypt and the terraced mortuary temples of Mentuhotep and Hatshepsut. At the end he returns to the matter of space composition more convinc- ingly than in volume I, for, after all, the problems of architecture have from the beginning been es- sentially the envelopment of space. At times, analogies between civ- ilizations are rather forced. For example, the increasing exclusion of the public from intimate reli- gious rites may have been a com- mon phenomenon in Egypt and Mesopotamia; but to cite as a par- allel in Greek times the Pana- thenaia, and make no mention of the Eleusinian Mysteries that were celebrated in the presence of thou- sands of worshipers, seems surpris- ing. On the other hand, the au- thor's interpretations of rituals and their settings are generally convinc- ing. One of the valuable by-products of both books is the frequent com- parison of ancient art with con- temporary drawing, painting and sculpture. Symbolism and "mys- tique" are subjected to intensive examination, but in a style which is generally very readable and full of appealing imagery. Thus the pyramids are described as reflecting "all that passes between earth and sky - all the infinite, delicate changes of the moving hours." Or, discussing the earliest vaults: "They were never visible from out- side. They were the chthonic im- ages, caverns in the heart of the earth." The final sentence of the second volume provides both an explana- tion of the title The Eternal Pres- ent and a summary of the author's approach to his subject: "The task of the historian is not merely to elucidate the past, but also to rec- ognize the signs that lead to the future." This he has done in so provocative a way that every reader, novice or savant, will be intrigued. Charles H. Morgan Amherst College</page></plain_text>
