<plain_text><page sequence="1">K. B HARATHA IYE R AN EARLY GUPTA SEAL OF THE MAHISASURAMARDINI The Mahisisuramardini is one of the Indian artist's favourite themes; and rightly so, as it is a cogent embodiment of the victory of beauty over the beast or of light over darkness. Its popularity has led sculptors to handle it variously: one effective variant shows the goddess stand- ing in triumph over a prostrate buffalo form. I feel that this variation so superbly interpreted at Badami, Brahmor, Alampur etc. was first created in the Gupta age and is typified by the seal I now propose to examine. I THE THEME The cult of the Mother Goddess is traceable from the Neolithic age, and the bull demon legend can also claim a great antiquity. Mithra, Gilgamesh, and Ahriman were bull-slayers, and Siva con- quered and tamed the bull. The sacrifice of the bull to the Mother Goddess and the ritual bull fights enacted by the Cretan priestesses are affirmations of the subjugation of the male god to the Great Mother. Later, even though the male god superseded the Mother Goddess she often suc- ceeded in re-affirming her own supremacy. The Devi mdhdtmya 1, a part of the Mdrkadeyapurdna (generally ascribed to the fourth century A.D.) extolled the goddess' preeminence among divine beings. To her, the gods willingly surren- dered their prowess and attributes. The same text reminds us that Mahisa was no mere buffalo but a mighty demon. He had a vast army and he defeated the devas, dethroned Indra, and usurped his place. He possessed the magical power of metamorphosis, which he made use of in his fight with the Devi when he suddenly turned himself into a mighty buffalo, confusing and terrifying theganas of the goddess' host. When she threw a noose and caught Mahisa by the neck he quickly changed into a lion, then into human form, and then became an elephant; as its trunk was cut off he assumed his buffalo form. When the Devi trampled it under her foot, he half-issued out of his buffalo mouth in his "real human form"2. In the terrific fight with Mahisa, the Devi rode on her fierce lion which took an active part in destroying the demon army. In the Purdnwa, the Devi is depicted as having a thousand arms equipped with innumerable weapons, richly attired and adorned and heroic beyond measure. SAgrawala, V. S.

III, p. 63. 179</page><page sequence="2">II THE EARLIEST REPRESENTATIONS The cult of Mahisisuramardini is much older than the Devi mdhdtmya whose account of the myth is its standardization. The six Kus.na statuettes in the Mathurd Museum described by Agrawala3 not only appear to be the earliest representations of the legend but also prove that the cult of the Devi had assumed sufficient importance at a remote date. These statuettes do not agree with the complex iconography prescribed for the goddess in the Devi madhdatmya nor do they convey anything of the tumultuous drama of the cosmic conflict depicted in it. The buffalo demon does not figure in any of these Kus.na representations in anthropomorphic form. The Devi is shown holding a buffalo raised to her waist; it looks as if it had been arrested when lurching upward. With one hand she presses the buffalo's hind quarters or hits it with a club while with the other she throttles or breaks the creature's neck. Of the six statuettes referred to4, five have six arms and one is four-armed. The typical Kus~ina girdle and the dhott are in evidence and the weapons held in the hands are the spear and trident. Unfortunately, these statuettes have not been illustrated by Agrawala. Odette Viennot has published ones (Mathurd Museum-Catalogue N. 875) which can be taken as sufficiently representative of this group. In the fight between the goddess and the animal it is killed not so much with weapons as with the hands. The Devi has no attendants, nor has she the lion vdhana. Thus, these representations are far removed from the Devi mdhdatmya version of the myth. The Kus.na statuettes depict an earlier version of the story of Mahisdsura- mardini which has an unmistakable rural atmosphere. That this iconographic type was not con- fined to Mathurd which appears to have been a centre of the Mahisdsuramardini cult, is evident from similar finds from Bhita6, Ahichchhatra7 and Nagars in Rajasthan. III THE RAJGHAT SEAL The seal from Rdjghdt under examination (Fig. i) is circular, measuring 2 cms in diameter and is slate coloured. In comparison with the Kus.na statuettes the depiction of the killing of the buffalo demon is charged with considerable dramatic power. It typifies the emergence of a new iconographic form. The figure of the Devi is elongated and lithe, revealing an astonishing plastic sensibility in its modeller. The image is free from ornaments except for a pair of earrings; the clothing is barely suggested but the body and limbs receive more attention. While the two right arms grow out of the shoulder, the two left hands emerge from near about the left elbow. Krishna Deva, who has examined the seal, thinks that the Devi appears to wear an armour or a breast 3 Agrawala, V.S., "A Catalogue of the Brahmanical Images in Mathura Art", Journal of the U.P. Historical Society (old series) Vol. XXII, pp. 158-1 59, Lucknow. 4 Ibid. s Odette Viennot, "The Goddess Mahisdsuramardini in Kus.na Art", Artibus Asiae, XIX, 1956, Fig. I, p. 369. 6 Marshall, J.H., "Excavation at Bhita", Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of India, 19x 1-12. 7 Agrawala, V.S., "Terracotta Figurines of Ahichchatrd", Ancient India, No.4, Figs.

Agrawala dates this to mid Ist century B.C. to early Ist century A.D. No grounds are adduced for this early dating. M. Seshadri thinks that the presence of the lion cannot be accounted for in such an early specimen, and, if the dating is accepted, Rajasthan would be the earliest centre of the cult which permeated to Mathurd in the Kus.na period (Mahigd- suramardini, Half-Yezrly Journal of the Mysore University, Vol.XXII, No.2, March I963, p. 6). 180</page><page sequence="3">Fig. I Mahisdsuramardini.

The upper right hand is damaged but from its pose one can assume that it held a dagger. This is evident from a similar seal probably from the same mould in the collection of the College of Indology of the Banaras Hindu University. The spear (perhaps a trident) driven into the neck of the prostrate animal is held in the lower right hand. The upper left hand holds a flaming cakra (wheel) while the lower one grasps the tail of the felled animal. The oval face of the Devi has lost its features. The kundalas (circular ear rings) and the hair arranged in curls are characteristic Gupta traits; so is the smooth rendering of the body. The elongation of the body and limbs invests the figure with suppleness; nonetheless it vibrates with power and dynamism, qualities not frequently met with in the more skilled and sophisticated productions of the Gupta age. The Amaravati and Nagarjunikonda figures are of course more graceful and almost creeper-like in their sway but are seldom expressive of the steely strength which the seal representation of the Devi conveys. The buffalo lies prostrate; the right foot of the goddess is placed between the horns, pressing down the animal's head which is still held high in resistance. The spear has made a deep gash just below the neck. The Devi drags the animal upward by the tail which falls in a loop with the tuft at the end well-emphasized. The back of the animal is arched by the violent impact of the goddess' action and the buffalo is pinned down by a three-pronged attack, directed towards the head, neck, and the hind quarters. The victorious figure of Mahis?isuramardini towers in heroic grandeur over the fallen animal and her raised right leg-bent at the knee-in a wide flung angle and away from the firmly planted left leg, emphasises the violent dynamism of her movements. This seal's depiction of the scene with the felled buffalo and three-fold movement of attack radically alters the earlier Kusina pattern and represents the norm or model which several subse- quent representations were to accept. An early but outstanding example of this is the Bhumara Mahisdsuramardini (Fig. 2) which even retains the medallion pattern of the seal, and has an attendant or gava as an additional feature. The treatment of Devi's figure is more sophisticated and the arrangement of the hair is like a judge's wig, a Gupta characteristic. The garment is well realised and there is a clear attempt at showing the ornaments on the figure of the goddess. The Devi is four-armed and equipped with shield (?), sword, and trident, while with the fourth hand she hauls the animal up by the tail. The pose assumed in the fight is also the same9 as in the seal but there is a world of difference. In the Bhumara figure, there is none of the dynamism and the power of challenge so well ex- pressed in the seal. The buffalo, though more skillfully rendered, is dead as a dodo, whereas the one on the seal retains the fire of the fighting bull. The Bhumara Devi figure is almost passive, in comparison with the heaving, space-filling vision of the seal. A Bhita so sandstone relief follows this general pattern though differing in details. The twelve-armed Mahisisuramardini in the Udayagiri rock-cut shirne,, datable to A.D. 402 is another close parallel though in both these 9 R.D. Banerji says that the goddess is represented as standing with the left foot on the head of the buffalo.., holds a shield(?) ... and in the lower (hand) the tail of the buffalo. Memoirs of the A.S.L., No. 16, 1924. Actually, the Devi is standing with her right foot on the head of the animal (Fig. 2) as in the case of the seal figure. Referring to this figure, Seshadri says: "still another left hand lifts the buffalo by the hind leg" (p. 7). As what is held in the hand is a continuation of the vertebra, Banerji's reference to the tail seems to be correct. Further seizing a hind leg would have resulted in turning the animal sideways as in the case of the Udayagiri representation which is not the case here. 1o Marshall, J.H., "Bhita", P1.XXXI, fig. 14. ' x Seshadri M., pl. 5 A. 183</page><page sequence="6">the circular panel does not recur. Even the Badami Mahisdsuramardini,2, cave i (sixth century A.D.) which retains the iconographical pattern of the seal, though exquisitely rendered, does not equal in verve and vigour the seal presentation. The Mahis.suramardini in the Alampur Museum,3 as well as the one in the Alampur Bdlabrahmdil temple follow the seal pattern. The type is trace- able in Brahmoris (Chamba) in Central India and Baroda. The Gaya Archaeological Museum has a relief from Guneri, Gaya (ninth to tenth centuries) which generally conforms to the seal pat- tern. By gesture, pose and poise, the seal representation has dramatized the conflict impres- sively: this is a feature which characterises innumerable representations including those which differ noticeably, otherwise, from the seal type under discussion. IV THE REVERSE OF THE SEAL The reverse side of the seal is somewhat defaced (Fig. 3). It is divided into three segments in one of which appears the word "Chhandoga" (Fig. 4) in Gupta Brahmi characters of circa fourth to fifth centuries. In the next is a somewhat pot-bellied seated figure with three visible heads whose chins end in what look like pointed beards. This obviously, is the figure of Brahmd (Fig. 5). In the third, a female figure lies on the ground with legs apart, apparently the right one stretched and the left leg raised at the knee. An animal, which looks like a horse ritually 'quitened' (Fig. 3) probably connects the seal with the asvamedha sacrifice. These designs are unconnected with the MahisZisuramardini theme. Krishna Deva who was associated with the Rdjghdt excavations informs me that while the word "Chhandoga" (one who sings Vedic hymns) is known from a few other sealings and tokens recovered from Rdjghit, the three designs on the back of the seal referred to, are of rare occurrence and may be typical of the Gupta period which witnessed the resurgence of the Brahmanical religion and Vedic sacrifices. According to him "The occurrence of the figures of Durga and Brahmd together with a scene depicting a ritual of the Ahvamedha sacrifice and a personal name etymologically referring to proficiency in the Vedas is of sufficient cultural significance. Perhaps a guess could be hazarded (though there is no proof) that 'Chhandoga' was a Vedic scholar from Varanasi who marked his association with one of the Imperial Gupta horse sacrifices by stamping a design commemorating a ritual of the sacrifice and the same person was also a devotee of Durgi and Brahmi (the latter again being associated with the four Vedas)." Conclusion Stylistically the figure of the Devi on the seal seems to belong to an earlier date than that of the Bhumara stone relief and can be ascribed to the early Gupta period (fourth to fifth centuries A. D.). It is also far removed in style from the ponderous and heavy-limbed Kus.na specimens and discloses a new iconographic type which attained wide prevalence from the Gupta age onwards. 12 Banerji, R.D., The Bas reliefs of Badami, Calcutta, 1923. 1s Seshadri M., Pl.
