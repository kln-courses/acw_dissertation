<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ROCK AGAINST SHAKESPEARE: STOICISM AND COMMUNITY IN T. S. ELIOT James Matthew Wilson During the last decades of his life, T. S. Eliot's reputation suffered at the hands of critics who accused him of a deeply rooted contempt for human life that sometimes found expression in an unworldly asociality and sometimes in an exclusive and totalitarian cultural politics. On this count, R. H. Rob bins would denounce Eliot as a failure "as poet, as critic, indeed, as man" (1). Eliot's work denies the reality or importance of the temporal world and over it all "hovers his contempt for human beings" (qtd. in Kojecky, 12). Although scholars such as Roger Kojecky have long since answered such charges, the criticisms have not fallen silent but, indeed, have grown more shrill through the decades. Certain of this misanthropy, but unsure of its specific source or target, Eliot's critics have painted him for a fascist or fascist sympathizer, while Antony Julius denounced him as an anti-Semite.1 In his recent popular history of the modernist movement, Peter Gay does not hesitate to stamp Eliot a totalitarian bigot (4). These scholarly assessments converge on doubts regarding Eliot's sympathies for, or even his interest in, other human beings, and his evident inclination toward a politics of order that seems to emerge from such indifference. And they are generally made from positions that assume the unassailable goodness of liberal modernity. I shall contend that the generally unacknowledged thread running through these accusations is that Eliot must be some species of modern or Christian "Stoic." And while it is true that his writings, like many in the Christian R&amp;L 43.3 (Autumn 2011) 49</page><page sequence="2">50 Religion de Literature tradition, preach a detachment that is intellectually indebted to the Stoics, I shall argue that Eliot's work also provides a penetrating and explicit critique of Stoicism as an ailment that infects the liberalism of the modern age just as it had the Elizabethan and the ancient Roman ages. In other words, Eliot's critics have accused him of positions that are in one key respect more closely associated with the modern liberal convictions that inform their thought than with any intellectual positions Eliot held. When detachment appears as a cause of isolation or mania in Eliot's work, the critics often call it "solipsism"; when it is affirmed as a species of faith and forbearance, it is sometimes praised as "Stoicism." But if we es tablish a definition of Stoicism in terms of its ethics and natural philosophy, we will see that "solipsism" and "Stoicism" are the objects of a sustained criticism in Eliot's writing: one that he decisively formulated in the period extending from 1927 to 1934, but which remains an ongoing feature of his literary and social-critical work thereafter. That is, Eliot solidified a critique of Stoicism during the period between his conversion to Anglo-Catholicism and his collaboration on his first completed dramatic work, a pageant play in support of the construction of forty-five new churches in the diocese of London. And yet, Eliot's diagnosis of "Stoicism" as a modern malady had already appeared in his early work: modern urban anonymity and what Eliot viewed as the teratological scale of the modern liberal state led to feelings of alienation and loneliness in modern persons, and these feelings begat a revival of an essentially Stoic concept of selfhood and of the cosmos. If a Stoic morality was a consequence of these conditions, it was one that ef fectively normalized them, so that we find traces of its morality in the worst instances of modern loneliness that Eliot depicts as well as in many of the moral prescriptions that would seek to correct or reform that condition. He would critique such assumptions in order to fashion a new prescription: Stoic ideas of the self are false, because they try to get by without the Aristotelian understanding of man as essentially political or communal in nature; Stoic morality is, therefore, grounded on a false anthropology and, indeed, is a consequence of human beings' becoming so isolated from their society that they can, in a sense, no longer think productively about what constitutes the moral or ethical life. Eliot evidendy perceived a tendency toward Stoicism in his own work, one which Steven Matthews has recently traced in terms of Eliot's engage ment with the metaphysical poets, including George Chapman. But, ac cording to Matthews, "Eliot was more ambivalent about the possibility of incorporating a temperamental stoicism within Christianity than critics of his work have hitherto contended" (23). I would go further and contend</page><page sequence="3">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 51 that Eliot realized that any critique of human nature, morality, and mo dernity must thoroughly exorcise Stoic tendencies rather than cultivate or reform them. With the production of his pageant play, The Rock, he would seek to transform prescription into practice: his play would describe man's communal nature but also effect it; the play itself summons the audience to recognize that it already lives as part of a national and sacral community. Such realization would in turn serve as the necessary foundation for the renewal of ethical and religious life. While Eliot would retain and develop his anti-Stoic and Aristotelian anthropology through the remainder of his career, in subsequent works it would be less pronounced than it had been in The Rock. Attending to Stoicism primarily as a subject of, rather than as an ele ment in, Eliot's work will result in a dramatic shift in how we understand the ideas of morality, community, religion, and the function of poetry and drama threaded through and informing it. Though often seeming to display the flint-faced indifference reminiscent of classical Stoic morality and the international cosmopolitanism also associated with that morality, neither adequately describes the positions discernible in Eliot's work. He is not in fact the poet of indifference, invisibility, impersonality, disillusion, detachment, and contemptus mundi—or of internationalism, cosmopolitanism, alienation, rootlessness, and placelessness—that critics and the popular imagination have constructed. Eliot's disciple E. W. E Tomlin once lamented, "And what about The Rock? Nobody seems to have read The Rock1' (187). If critics would attend more closely to that play, our understanding of Eliot's anthropology and sociology would be significantly altered. Randy Malamud's study of Eliot's verse dramas has convincingly shown that those works are fundamentally concerned with the achievement of community through a shared or "valid" language. In each of Eliot's plays, Malamud finds the author working to counteract the "futility of the com municative enterprise" frequently on display in his poems (3). My argument builds upon this claim, but seeks to define more clearly what constitutes real community according to Eliot, and considers more fully the moments in Eliot's prose that define the problem of modern life as a specifically Stoic one. But this study aims at more than the mere correction of the critical heritage of Eliot's work. For his reflections on Stoicism and his later dramatic response to Stoic morality in The Rock both address the historical conditions that make ethics possible: insights that anticipate and contribute to the un derstanding of community and tradition developed most compellingly in the moral philosophy of Alasdair Maclntyre. As such, Eliot's interrogation of Stoicism speaks to our moment in suggesting that we mis-locate the nature, contents, and fertility of moral philosophy when we fail to set it within a</page><page sequence="4">52 Religion (fe Literature meaningful community of interpretation. The Rock not only provides us this theory of community but also attempts to actualize it. Eliot and the Possibility of Christian Stoicism If we turn to Eliot's most sympathetic critics, we are likely to find de scriptions of his work as exemplifying Stoic ethics. John J. Soldo writes in The Tempering of T S. Eliot of the "genuineness of Eliot's Stoicism" (84), and proceeds to use the term as "a convenient tag for his wider religious sensibility" (85). Following this practice, Benjamin G. Lockerd, Jr., in his introduction to the reissue of Russell Kirk's admiring biography, Eliot and His Age, characterizes Eliot's species of political conservatism as "Stoical" (xvii). Lockerd means primarily that it is detached from a concern with the outcomes of human action and prepared to endure whatever darkness the future may bring. His choice of adjectives serves primarily to draw Kirk, the biographer, and Eliot, the subject, closer together in the minds of Kirk's readers. For Kirk was a self-described Christian Stoic and his book testi fies to his personal identification with Eliot and his devotion to Eliot as the exemplary Christian and conservative intellectual of the modern age.2 If Lockerd is right to suggest that the reserved Eliot and laconic Kirk shared much in common, we may nonetheless question the propriety of this label. In another context, Eliot's friend Bonamy Dobrée remarks that he had "always been revolted" by the quotation from St. John of the Cross that Eliot had set as an epigraph to his fragment of a verse drama, Sweeney Agonistes (80).3 St. John had written, "Hence the soul cannot be possessed of the di vine union, until it has divested itself of the love of created beings" (80-81). Dobrée confronted Eliot regarding the epigraph, sharing his disgust, in the 1930s—a decade whose particular species of political correctness moved under the aegis of the Bloomsbury Group, with its proclaimed ethics of intimate friendship and passionate personal sincerity. Fashionable judg ment said that private friendship was all, belief and dogma a danger, and so detaching oneself from loving other created beings may actually have been the one unforgivable sin in an age that thought loving unwisely but too well the highest virtue.4 Eliot replied to Dobrée in writing, suggesting that this piety of personal affection was precisely what he meant to reject. He did not think that ordinary human affections are capable of leading us to the love of God, but rather that the love of God is capable of informing, intensifying and elevating our human affections, which otherwise have little to distinguish them from the "natural" affections of animals. (Dobrée 81)</page><page sequence="5">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 53 While Dobrée does not say so, it is clear that he is grappling with Eliot's apparent indifference to persons and assent to unfashionable Christian dogmas about an unworldly love of an unworldly God—attributes we may justly be tempted to follow Lockerd in calling "Stoical." Dobrée can read Eliot's remarks only in terms of a dualism of intimate friendship and asocial indifference, of active love and its withholding: a dualism that presumes God to be one idea or ideology among others and which ignores the various and always incomplete adaptations of Augustinian theology in the West of which Eliot's comment is just one expression (cf. Dupré 226). Nonetheless, one of Eliot's most recent biographers, Lyndall Gordon, attempts to project this confrontation onto the form of Eliot's entire life. From his youth, she suggests, Eliot was absorbed in a hard mystical journey to be one and alone with God; so monomaniacal was he in this effort that he did not hesitate to cut himself off from his first wife, the sometime muse of his middle age, and his many friends as he surpassed them, one by one, on the path to the divine.5 The disputable evidence and possible tendentiousness of Gordon's biography aside, we may ask, can these attributes rightly be understood as a modern form of Stoicism?6 In Eliot's poetry, we find some immediate correspondences with the writings of the one classical Stoic to whom Eliot repeatedly refers in his prose, Seneca. We find in the opening pages of The Rock, for instance, two passages that seem to echo quite neady the two axial concepts of historical Stoicism—a surprising fact worth our dwelling on, given my intention to show presently that this play realizes in verse a critique of Stoicism made explicit in his prose. The first Chorus of the play begins, The eagle soars in the summit of Heaven, The Hunter with his dogs pursues his circuit. O perpetual revolution of configured stars, O perpetual recurrence of determined seasons, O world of spring and autumn, birth and dying! The endless cycle of idea and action... (7) This trope is no mere introductory flourish, but one repeated elsewhere in Eliot's work and given sustained reflection in Four QuartetsJ The cyclical movements of the stars, of the seasons, and of the huntsman evoke an eternal, rational order to which there is neither outside nor "above." For Seneca, and in classical Stoicism more generally, wisdom and happi ness are one and they consist in recognizing and accepting just this eternal, rational order. "Nature is the guide I choose," Seneca writes, "wisdom lies in not wandering from her path and in moulding oneself in accordance with her law and example" (87). So Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic emperor,</page><page sequence="6">54 Religion de Literature would write a century later, "to be vexed at anything which happens is a separation of ourselves from nature" (18). Wisdom consists, in brief, in reconciling ourselves to our proper position between the huntsman and the stars. Nature, for Seneca, consists not, as it did for Aristotle and as it would for St. Thomas Aquinas, of potential for growth to perfection, but of an already achieved, necessary, and rational perfection in the cosmos that does not fundamentally grow or change but stricdy and inexorably continues (cf. Dupré 26-27). As Pierre Hadot writes, according to the physics (natural philosophy) of Stoicism, this necessary order and eternal cycle, in keeping with such a description, does not vary by contingency and so also does not depend on us or change for us. Nature operates according to a law at once eternal, rational, and deter mined—not to say good. Hence, Stoic ethics can consist of nothing other than the fundamental choice to be coherent with ourselves by conforming our wills to the already coherent natural order of "the totality of beings" (Hadot 128). Aurelius admonishes, "death certainly, and life, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, all these things equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us neither better nor worse. Therefore they are neither good nor evil" (15-16). Stoic morality entails recognizing that the only kind of good and evil that can exist in such a determined system is in the human will, which is free either to accept and follow the natural order or to reject it. In this moral choice alone consists good or evil (Hadot 132). Evil occurs in the will's attempt to defy or "separate" itself from nature, as Aurelius instructs. We attain to virtue, on the other hand, exclusively by ordering the will to nature, which Seneca says brings us to "a state of peace, of freedom." The happy man is he "who recognizes no good and evil apart from a good and an evil mind.. .who does not recognize any good greater than the one he alone can confer upon himself, and who will find true pleasure in despising pleasures" (88). Classical Stoicism puts philosophy through the olive press, crushing it down to three areas: physics, ethics, and logic, each of whose contents are also radically reduced compared to the Socratic philosophy from which they pardy derive. Its physics tells us of the necessary, rational order that is the cosmos; its ethics teaches us to conform to it and to recognize that only this conformity is good, while all things outside the mind are rational but morally indifferent; its logic trains us to recognize and describe what is outside us in a manner that marks it as distinct from our wills and so as morally unimportant. Detachment, an astringent refusal of what Hadot calls "subjective or anthropomorphic considerations," is the logical exercise for the mind that would be happy (128, 136). Thus, Dobrée might be forgiven for detecting a trace of Stoic logic in Eliot's cool observation that "human</page><page sequence="7">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 55 affections...have little to distinguish them from the 'natural' affections of animals" absent the transformation wrought by divine love. The Rock's first chorus would seem to manifest these three branches of thought. In addition to the determined circling order with which it begins, the Chorus tells us that "I journeyed to London, to the timekept City, / Where the River flows, with foreign flotations" (7). With a detached, em pirical logic, he reports an anatomy of a society indifferent to religion, to the shortage of churches, and indeed to the church as a whole; it is given over to mundane pleasures, and incapable of being shaken from them. It is worth highlighting that this dry realism and cultural anatomy iterates the more piercing and phantasmagoric sketches of city life in The Waste Land (1922), which depicts an entire civilization as to some degree turned "Stoic," withdrawn and indifferent to all things beyond the individual will. Thus, Eliot's major poem of modern life treats a society of lonely Stoics, carried forward by an indifferent nature but hardly reconciled to it, in the unforgiving light typical of Stoic exercises in "logic." But whereas The Waste Land has frequently left readers baffled as to how they should address their wills to Eliot's tableaux, The Rock enjoins us explicitly. In response to this inauspicious setting, where "the Church does not seem to be wanted / In country or in suburb," the Rock enters and tells his audience, the Christian flock, to build new churches anyway (8). He admonishes us to resign the "things that men count for happiness," and to seek The good deeds that lead to obscurity, accepting With equal face those that bring ignominy The applause of all or the love of none. (8) He concludes, Make perfect your will. I say: take no thought of the harvest, But only of proper sowing. (9) The lines, more than faintly Pauline at the start, and couched in the figures of Christ's various parables on faith and evangelization, no less evidently hint of the indifference to consequences and the primacy of the righdy ordered will at the center of Stoic ethics. If these admonitions are unmistak ably Christian, are we right to say this moral theology is that of a Christian Stoic? The long history of Christian admiration for Stoicism in general and Seneca in particular suggests we should. However, Louis Dupré has claimed that early modern efforts to synthesize Christianity and Stoicism consistently result in a hybrid "neither Stoic nor Christian nor modern," because they</page><page sequence="8">56 Religion de Literature could not reconcile the Stoic idea of an "eternal cosmic order with that of personal responsibility before God" (129). Doubt regarding such efforts only grows stronger after we acknowledge the ostensible similarity between the Stoic physics of eternal nature as logos and the Johannine vision of God as the logos eternally prior to its creation. Stoicism tells us the universe is nec essary, intelligible order. John tells us, to the contrary, we exist contingently by grace of a necessary Being outside of existent things who is nonetheless intelligible to us. In the Stoic order of nature, freedom is limited to the as sent or dissent of the individual human will within a static cosmos; in the Christian vision of creation, God and human persons act with a dynamic freedom that unfolds as history.8 The usual consequence of Christian ad aptations of Seneca or other Stoic writers was a preservation of language but a transformation of meaning; as Dupré writes, it came to a sacrifice of "the spirit of Stoic philosophy to the letter of some isolated adages" (129). When the Rock, St. Peter, tells us to perfect our wills, we can hardly think it means what Seneca meant, if only because this perfected will is happiness for Seneca. The mind is its own place, its own heaven or hell, for the Stoic, and all things beyond it may be true, because rational, but they are morally indifferent. For the Christian, this may be the gospel of Satan, as Milton preaches. For the young St. Augustine, recognizing that the submission, but not the perfection, of the will was only the necessary preface to looking beyond oneself to the perfection of God was one of his major intellectual difficulties in the years just before and after his conversion.9 For Milton and Augustine alike, the Christian way lies in a submission to the will of God, a movement out of the enclosure of self as self-sufficient toward a recogni tion of the self's dependence on a grace beyond itself and a fulfillment of the self's destiny in the happiness of eternal life. So it was also with the early modern Blaise Pascal, with whose Jansenist form of Christianity Eliot identified in several respects. Pascal's Christianity was evidently influenced by the Stoics insofar as he conceived the vast, indif ferent infinities of space in terms akin to the Stoic conception of an eternal order. For the Stoic, the individual self is a monad within an eternal order; for Pascal the self is a point in the endless geometrical abyss of space.10 For the Stoic, morality consists exclusively in an interior ordering of the will. For Pascal, too, this is the case insofar at least as there is only the thinnest horizontal or social dimension in his Christianity.11 But Pascal is also a severe critic of the Stoics for the same reasons as were the Protestant Milton and his indirect spiritual master, Augustine. The mind, once conformed to nature, becomes self-sufficient and the cause of its own happiness, the Stoics tell us. Pascal tells us, to the contrary, that the mind, by itself, is nothing but an interior abyss just as the universe is an external</page><page sequence="9">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 57 one (17). Thus, because the "Stoics say, 'Retire within yourselves; it is there you will find your rest,'" they mislead (130). Rest comes only through faith in the God at once infinitely beyond and most deeply within the self. All efforts to satisfy the self independently fail, "because the infinite abyss [within the soul] can only be filled by an infinite and immutable object, that is to say, only by God himself" (113). This drama of human emptiness and the need to be filled through redemption disturbs and wrenches what had been, for the Stoics, an eternal stasis in the cosmos and in the monadic self alike. According to Pascal, fall and redemption, sinful withdrawal from God, Christ's incarnation, and a return in faith of the repentant soul to its original state chart points on a linear path by which the Christian bisects the infinite circles of the Stoic abyss. So in the Christian tradition more generally, the logos as outside time, and creation as a finite, contingent land of unlikeness, punctures and limits the cyclical stasis definitive of Stoic physics. Acknowledging these theological tensions lets us hold open the possibility that Eliot could be understood as advocating "Stoicism in ethics" as he had come to advocate royalism in politics (For Lancelot Andrewes vii). The passages we have cited do not preclude this. But, we may find a resolution to this question of ethical tradition if we can determine whether Stoic or Johnnine physics undergirds the presump tion of a cyclical and rational natural order with which The Rock begins. To do that, we shall have to back out of Eliot's words and take another look at his posthumous reputation. Physics and the Drama of the Will In a recent essay in Modern Age, Adam K. Webb urges conservative critics of liberal modernity to take back "the Cosmopolis"; he argues that conser vatives have lost many political and cultural battles because they think of their ideals in provincial terms and act only on isolated and provincial scales. Conservative "critics of liberal modernity" from far flung traditions should recognize that they "occupy much the same intellectual space" in taking issue "with liberalism's emphasis on rights over duties, with the uprooted self-indulgence of the global upper-middle class, with the erosion of com munities that once anchored human affairs" (120). He advocates replacing this stunted, "territorialized" vision with a cosmopolitan one, and does so fully aware that it is Stoicism that gives us the very idea of "cosmopolitan ism," of citizenship not in a particular community or society but of the whole world. For the Stoics, the cosmopolitans were those virtuous minorities in every society, regardless of their political citizenship (122). Late in the essay,</page><page sequence="10">58 Religion de Literature he introduces Eliot as a modern example of the cosmopolitan that our own times should emulate. In a response to Webb's essay in the same issue, Mark ShifFman accepts this description of Eliot, but reverses the evaluation. "Eliot's universality is a rarified kind, appealing primarily to a highly educated elite," he writes (136). He takes Webb at his word, but gives us a definition of Stoic cosmopolitan ism that reveals global citizenship as an empty term. There is no "universal terrain," he explains, 'All terrain is local terrain—and not only by definition, but in reality" (137). One can only know genuine universals by means of, through, and in the particular. The Stoic can conceive of cosmopolitanism, of being a global citizen, only because he has in practice reduced reality to the two axes of physics and ethics. Seneca views the cosmos—the total ity of all things—as rationally ordered, eternal, and necessary. Wisdom or virtue consists solely in recognizing this true but morally indifferent order of things, and so the particular is entirely stripped of meaning save as an element in this totality. Indeed, Stoic logic involves training the will to strip its moral investment in things outside itself. The ethics that stems from this physics therefore makes the human will the only other reality: there is everything and there is the self's attitude toward it, which, if good, accepts it. Thus Seneca tells us in his account of the Happy Life, "I will be indifferent to Fortune," but also "I shall view all lands as my own, and my own as belonging to others" (102). Further, the virtuous man views "exile as an empty name," asking, "What evil is there in changing the country where you live?" (103). In Stoic physics, there is space but not place, geometry but not topography, there is location but not attachment. Shiftman urges against this claim, writing that space "has no identity; it is an interchangeable quantum without human meaning, an indifferent theater for the drama of the will" (137). If we conceive of place as indifferent, as homogenous space, then we will naturally end up with a Stoic conception of virtue, for no other form of ethics could so exquisitely suit a conception of the real as uniform empty space. One can be a virtuous cosmopolitan, Shiffman concludes, but only if one's concept of virtue is that of the Stoics. Other traditions are, in Webb's terms, provincial, because it is only within those traditions that view the world in richer and more concrete terms than homogenous empty space that ethical thought can avoid reducing reality to the dyad of universal rational order and the interior will of the self. Shiffman's riposte is well taken; perhaps surprisingly to Webb and Shiff man alike, it elaborates abstractly what Eliot himself says more concretely in his own discussions of Stoicism.12 In 1927, Eliot published the two con ceptually richest of his many essays on the Elizabethan drama. The first, "Seneca in Elizabethan Translation," attends not to Seneca as philosopher,</page><page sequence="11">JAMES MATTHEWWILSON 59 but as the author of Roman tragedies; the popularity of his plays in Latin and in translation for Renaissance audiences significantly informed the rise of the theater in England and the craft of its major playwrights from Marlowe and Shakespeare to Webster and Ford. The essay addresses a va riety of questions, but at one point pauses to account for the way in which Seneca's tragedy differs from that of the Greeks. The Roman Stoic was a simpler creature than was the Greek, and his training was that of devotion to the State, his virtues were public virtues. The Greek knew well enough the idea of the State, but he had also a strong traditional morality which constituted, so to speak, a direct relation between him and the gods, without the mediation of the State. (Selected Essays 56) The Greek felt the thick tether of myriad relations, some of which could come into conflict and between which choices must be made at great cost. Thus, Eliot holds up Antigone, that play of conflict between duty to the State, to family, and to the gods, as exemplary of the Greek tragic sense. In contrast, Seneca did not and could not have attempted such a play: it "could hardly have been transposed for Roman sentiment. In the drama of Seneca there are no conflicts, except the conflict of passion, temper, or appetite with the external duties" (56-57). As Shiffman argues, conquest of the will is the only drama in Stoic space and time. Pursuing the comparison further, Eliot concludes that the Greeks were the heirs of traditions firmly located and cultivated in a particular place. As such, the thought and feeling of their tragedies are complex but united, dense with the accretions of time: In the Greek tragedy.. .the moralising is not the expression of a conscious 'system' of philosophy; the Greek dramatists moralise only because morals are woven through and through the texture of their tragic idea. Their morals are a matter of feeling trained for generations, they are hereditary and religious, just as their dramatic forms themselves are the development of their early liturgies. Their ethics of thought are one with their ethics of behavior. (57) Seneca's drama, in contrast, is rhetoric—declamation with no life behind it, and with no poetry beyond that of the words on the page. This derives, Eliot speculates, from the deracination of life in the Roman Empire. Roman skepticism was "the result of too rapid and great expansion and mixture of races cancelling each other's beliefs, rather than the product of a lively inquiring intelligence." And so, "the 'beliefs' of Stoicism are a consequence of skepticism; and the ethic of Seneca's plays is that of an age which supplied the lack of moral habits by a system of moral attitudes and poses" (58). Stoic physics' conception of space results from the historical experience of hav ing been robbed of place through the expansion of empire and the arrival</page><page sequence="12">60 Religion &amp; Literature of a gigantic administrative regime that gives the force of law a feeling of ubiquity and implacability; one forgets the placement of former times, the vital drama of social life, and assumes dislocation in space as a permanent and natural condition. This provoked the whittling down of ethics to an attitude of will, but also hollowed out art's communally shared story, leaving only words. Public performance withers to private declamation. In "Shakespeare and the Stoicism of Seneca," Eliot accounts more fully for Stoicism's emergence in Seneca's Rome but also in Shakespeare's England. The thinning or loss of a sense of place that the growth of the Roman Empire brought about led to a sense of the individual as alienated from, and powerless before, the "necessary and eternal" order of cosmos and world-State alike. A similar sense of alienation and impotence obtained in early modern England. Eliot concludes, it "was natural that in a time like that of Elizabeth Stoicism should appear. The original Stoicism, and especially the Roman Stoicism, was of course a philosophy suited to slaves: hence its absorption into early Christianity" (112). The Stoic attitude is that of the slave: of the man who greets the universe possessing nothing but his rationally ordered will. Eliot then quotes a Senecan maxim from the poetry of George Chapman, "A man to join himself with the Universe / In his main sway, and make in all things fit —," which he glosses thus: A man does not join himself with the Universe so long as he has anything else to join himself with; men who could take part in the life of a thriving Greek city-state had something better to join themselves to; and Christians have had something better. Stoicism is the refuge for the individual in an indifferent or hostile world too big for him; it is the permanent substratum of a number of versions of cheering oneself up. Nietzsche is the most conspicuous modern instance of cheering oneself up. The Stoical attitude is the reverse of Christian humility. (112)13 In periods of "dissolution and chaos," of universal empire and powerless individuals, Stoicism provides a natural physics and ethics, neither challeng ing the appearance of a world grown "too big," nor questioning that self possession or mastery of the will is the only good (112). When Eliot turns to Shakespeare's plays, he notes the self-aggrandizing, self-dramatizing attitude of Shakespeare's major protagonists, from Hamlet to Othello. They each instantiate the individual who has lost everything, who has brushed against fate, and so discovered his powerlessness within a cosmos that is rational but determined, ordered but indifferent. The only thing left to the individual is the self-assertion of pride in maintaining against all outside forces the integrity of an identity: "I am Antony still," says Antony, because the "I" is the only thing left in his power. This, Eliot calls "cheering oneself up." It is obvious that Eliot judges the Greek tragedy superior to either the</page><page sequence="13">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 61 Senecan or the Elizabethan, and that he believes it richer, more dense in meaning and truth, precisely because it derives from and is intended for a particular community, rooted in a thick tangle of traditions. Greek drama could represent the conflict of a range of competing virtues thanks to its having a range of virtues; Stoicism reduces the virtues to virtue—singular—in consequence of the reduction of place to the mathematical measurements of space and the reactionary "cheering oneself up" in which the defeated and isolated individual indulges. Eliot's insights echo the analysis of Stoicism found in the German philoso pher and social theorist Max Scheler. Writing during the First World War, Scheler diagnosed the temptation to Stoicism in general, and its modern manifestation in secular liberal "altruism," as a symptom of ressentiment (44). Drawing on Nietzsche's use of that term in the Genealog)! of Morals (Works 3.17), Scheler more fully theorizes Eliot's notion of "cheering oneself up" as the "transvaluation of values" that occurs when one feels impotent to attain what one most profoundly desires. Desiring but unable to experi ence the personal love and contact described in Christianity, the modern humanitarian turns against it, disdains it, and proclaims himself in favor of an impersonal, universal love of mankind. Scheler's biting critique—itself susceptible to accusations of ressentiment against the bourgeois culture he saw eroding the vitality and nationalism of modern Germany—suggests that Stoicism, ancient and modern, is reducible to anger against the good it cannot have.14 He writes that universal or "cosmopolitan" love of mankind reveals itself as a manifestation of inner protests and aversion against the immediate circle of the community and its inherent values—against the 'community' which has physically and mentally formed a man. Experience shows very frequendy that children who vainly sought their parents' tenderness, who felt 'out of place' at home for some reason, or whose love was rejected, expressed their inner protest through intense enthusiasm for "mankind."...On a historical scale, this is the source of the love of 'mankind,' the 'cosmopolitan' affect, which is so noticeable in the writings of the later Stoics: it spread in the aging Roman Empire when the individual, severed from the nourishing and sustaining force of the city state, felt lonely and deprived of all support. Exactly the same motive underlies 'modern humanitarian love.' (124) The Stoic, "burned by community," becomes not a misanthrope but a cosmopolitan; his love of all conceals his hatred of each. Eliot softens the language of Scheler's analysis, but crucially retains the sense of Stoicism as an after-effect, an ethical formation born of reaction against a fruitful com munal and traditional ethos that has been put out of reach by personal and historical catastrophe.15 Curiously, Eliot, like Scheler, seems to be dredging up the ancient Stoicism of Seneca and the possible early modern Stoicism</page><page sequence="14">62 Religion &amp; Literature of Shakespeare primarily as a means of making a coded attack on con temporary liberalism in its cosmopolitan and humanitarian forms. He thus suggests Stoicism as a trans-historical idea, as a temptation of the present as much as of the past, and so his anatomy of it serves more as a rebuke of the present than as an arcane historical inquiry. In this, he anticipates by half a century a more sustained deconstruction of the Stoic attitude. Stoicism as the "Canned" Residue of Communal Tradition Eliot's comments also resemble the discussion of Stoicism in Alasdair Maclntyre's After Virtue (1981), in which Maclntyre develops the assertion that ethical traditions emerge only within communities stable enough to conceive and contend over a conception of the good. Community is the condition of possibility for such a conception, because only in the experience of a shared life do human beings witness individual lives that appear either better or worse; these differences allow them to speculate on what a or the good life might actually look like. Moreover, the experience of generations leads to refinements and transformations in the conception of the good life through the inevitable conflicts generated by the particular notions indi vidual members of a community might hold. Without a stable and extended community, one does not acquire a basis—a sufficient number of individual samples or facts, as it were—for making generalizations about the form of a human life well lived.16 But not only would one lack the foundation for conceiving what the good life looks like, one would also lack the conditions necessary to find a path to attaining it. Community thus makes possible an ethical telos, a vision of the perfected human life at which persons aim, and it makes possible the seeking and attainment of that telos. But what happens when a previously stable society with a coherent vision of the good life is disrupted and broken up? The question is not merely hypothetical. As the Greek city-state system was dissolved and absorbed with the rise of the Macedonian kingdom and then with the much greater one of Roman imperium, the relatively small and closed communities that allowed one to conceive a shared vision of the good life in community dis solved as well (Maclntyre 169). The condition for thinking about ethics, in terms of a teleology whose aim is the good life lived in community, became impossible. What remained, according to Maclntyre, was primarily the conception of moral law detached from any outcome. Conceptions of law, unlike concep tions of the virtues, do not as evidently rely on one's being able to see them as integral and leading to a particular good form of life; moreover, a community</page><page sequence="15">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 63 where questions about the good life can be asked would naturally do so in terms of attributes that would be present: "Of what do we think the good life consists?" But while laws may originally be legislated within the context of answering such a question, they can also endure as obligations, telling us what we must or must not do, without disclosing any conception of the good to be attained thereby. And so, with the collapse of a self-coherent community, there "would be no genuine shared common good; the only goods would be goods of individuals. And the pursuit of any private good, being often and necessarily in these circumstances liable to clash with the good of others, would appear to be at odds with the requirements of the moral law" (Maclntyre 170). Ancient Stoicism emerges as the ethics for those who have lost a sense of belonging to a community and who now take existence within a gigantic legal system to be normative in its stead. Indeed, Dupré suggests that such static legalism is the only aspect of the ancient Aristotelian conception of nature that the Stoics retained (26). For them, law protects the private goods of one individual from another, while virtue—the singular command of the will—inures the private mind to the fortune it cannot control. At the large scale of empire, particulars all come to look alike, to appear interchangeable, equal, as meaningful only as parts of a cosmic juridical order. One can no longer conceive of a form of happiness lived in such circumstances that requires more than a mastery of the will, because, in a cosmos so vast and implacable, only the will any longer appears subject to the self's direction. Maclntyre and Eliot both suggest that Stoicism is not a singular histori cal phenomenon, but one capable of reappearing in different but related circumstances (Maclntyre 169-70). But they do not mean that Stoicism is one ethical tradition among others that might occur. Rather, both of them impress upon us that the shared life of a small community—the Greek city-state being the prototypical example—is the necessary condition for the development of any robust conception of the good life and an ethical and cultural tradition that fortifies it. Stoicism is just that phenomenon which appears when a previously robust community significandy dissolves, its traditions falling into decay. Stoicism is not a distinct ethical tradition but the residue of one; it is the consolation for alienated slaves and subjects who faintly remember that it once was possible for a human being to be happy. In many ways, the Stoicism Eliot criticizes sounds like the set of ideas some readers have identified with Eliot himself. Webb is not alone in con ceiving Eliot to have been a deracinated cosmopolitan, closed in upon and protective only of the dignity of his self. Eliot surely sensed some Stoic disposition in himself or in his own writing—"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," with its wandering ego struggling for self-coherence within an</page><page sequence="16">64 Religion &amp; Literature unalterable social milieu, might be the biography of a young Stoic. And he clearly detected it in the work of contemporaries with whom he is often associated. In his essay on Shakespeare, Eliot states he is unconcerned with what the historical Shakespeare may have thought, and hopes merely to interpret his plays in a manner suitable or necessary for the contemporary scene. Remaking Shakespeare in the image of Seneca served as a skillful means of attacking the myriad disciples of Nietzsche in his time, as well as the pseudo-Stoic hardboiled paganism of modernist writers and artists, such as the poets Ezra Pound and H.D., whose work idealized a form of human identity that was monadic, austere, and as impermeable as stone.17 It seems all the more appropriate, then, that in his commentary on Seneca quoted above, the Anglo-Catholic Eliot insists that the "Stoical attitude is the reverse of Christian humility." The Stoicism typical of Rome or his own day is a morality conceivable only to those who have lost the communal conditions necessary for productive thought on the character of the good life, and it is one that clings in pride to the self, and disdains everything outside the self. While the self-mastery of the Stoic may appear similar to the restraint of the Christian, who in humility does not crave the respect or power the world can offer, they are radically opposed. Again, the Christian makes perfect the will in order to live eternally in God, while the Stoic conquers it in order to live securely only in the self. In "East Coker," Eliot deprecates the "knowledge derived from experience," speaking of it as the "folly" rather than the "wisdom of old men" (Complete Poems and Plays 125). Such hoary figures bear a certain resemblance to the benumbed, indifferent Stoics, who preach self-sufficiency and conformity to an eternal pattern of nature unilluminated by divine revelation. He admonishes these men that such patterns are "merely a receipt for deceit," and that to make the will perfect one must first discover that "humility is endless." Far from cauterizing the self, we must discover that this humility, self-resignation and self-giving, is the necessary means of overcoming the "fear of possession, / Of belonging to another, or to others, or to God" (125-26). In the ethics of Four Quartets, Stoicism is not compatible with Christianity, but the condition that must be transcended. Self-possession amounts to fear, and humility becomes the means to belonging to God. This opposition of Stoic pride and individualism to community and Christian humility reveals contours of meaning in another critique Eliot commenced in the years after his conversion to Anglo-Catholicism. In his respectful, but severe, judgment of Irving Babbitt's New Humanism, Eliot attends largely to its advocates' explicit refusal of Christianity and religion in general as "dogma," even as it inadvertently promotes this rejection to a dogma of its own and, thereby, makes the New Humanism into a weak</page><page sequence="17">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 65 substitute for religion. In "The Humanism of Irving Babbitt," he observes, The problem of humanism is undoubtedly related to the problem of religion. Mr. Babbitt makes it very clear.. .that he is unable to take the religious view—that is to say that he cannot accept any dogma or revelation; and that humanism is the alterna tive to religion. And this brings up the question: is this alternative any more than a substitute?.. .Is it, in the end, a view of life that will work by itself, or is it a derivative of religion which will work only for a short time in history, and only for a few highly cultivated persons like Mr. Babbitt—whose ancestral traditions, furthermore, are Christian and who is, like many people, at the distance of a generation or so from definite Christian belief? Is it, in other words, durable beyond one or two genera tions? (Selected Essays 76-77) Published the same year as the essays on Seneca and Elizabethan drama, this query suggests a subde identity between Seneca and Babbitt, between Stoicism as the decayed ethics of the Greek polis and humanism as the shadow, the substitute, for those who are "highly cultivated" but alienated from the Christianity of their ancestors. Stoicism is substitute morality, humanism substitute Christianity. Eliot's emphasis in the first part of the passage is on the humanist's refusal to accept revelation and dogma, indicating that the weakness of humanism is an intellectual failure, or one of faith. But within a few sentences, the critique slips from the question of revelation from above to the dissemina tion of shared and sustained belief to those below the "highly cultivated" Harvard professor at whose feet Eliot had studied. Eliot thus suggests a relation between revelation and community, between the knowledge of faith (dogma) and a life of shared traditions, conflicts, and conceptions of the good. Although the Christian revelation may come from outside of time, much less outside of any Christian community, in order actually to be revealed it must be revealed to someone—or rather, to the members of a community capable of receiving it and interpreting it together within a shared tradition. Without a living community of interpretation, even the most profound truths can appear as the various data shelved in a research library, available to be known, haphazardly synthesized by the superior brow, but not to be taken whole, felt, understood, and believed. The English Church as a concrete, national ecclesial community is the modern heir to the sacred community of the ancient Greek polis. In another essay, Eliot would dismiss Babbitt's "secularized" Buddhism, which he integrated with his humanism, as unconvincing because it is ahistorical and asocial, deriving from a rarified scholarship rather than a shared life in the church: I suggest that the Buddhism of Irving Babbitt is not simply a purified Buddhism, essence of Buddhism freed from all gross superstitions and made palatable for the intellectual and cultivated modern man: but that it is an artificial Buddhism—not</page><page sequence="18">66 Religion de Literature only purified but canned; separated from all the traditional ways of behaving and feeling which went to make it a living religion in its own environments, which made it a religion possible for every level of intelligence and sensibility from the highest to the lowest. (Untitled Chapter 23). Only that religion which is possible for everyone because incarnate in a community and tradition can be an authentic religion; all else is "canned" and artificial "residue." Five years later, in his Norton Lectures at Harvard, he would make this connection between Stoicism and rarified Yankee Humanism more explicit. He begins his lectures with a quotation from the late President Charles Eliot Norton, intended to display his waiting without hope, his detachment from the upheavals of the day. In a second quotation, Eliot captures Norton greeting anarchy and material progress alike as morally indifferent; in true Stoic fashion, only the will can be good or evil, while outward events merely conform to the necessities of nature. "Whether our period of economic enterprise, unlimited competition, and unrestrained individualism, is the highest stage of human progress is to me very doubtful," Norton begins. And he concludes that, should the forces succeed, who are "banding to gether for the destruction of the many institutions" in which civilization is embodied, it "would not grieve me much to know that this were to be the case" {The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism 4). Eliot's commentary is illuminating. Norton is, without question, a humanist; he believed, as did Babbitt, in the "permanent importance of literature," which was perforce the non-dogmatic, secular scripture of humanism (5). But Norton has also, Eliot notes, "the moral and spiritual qualities, of a Stoic kind, which are possible without the benefits of revealed religion" (3). Such a claim makes sense on its own; Norton does not possess a hope that stretches infinitely beyond himself, and so has only the preservation and dignity of the self as a standard of action. Reserve, self-mastery, and detachment are the hallmarks of such a man. As Eliot phrases it, the Sto icism of Norton confessed, "To do the useful thing, to say the courageous thing, to contemplate the beautiful thing: that is enough for one man's life" (3). But the adjective "Stoic," in the context of Eliot's writing during this period, suggests that it is not only revealed religion that Norton lacks but a sense of belonging to a community committed to a shared conception of the good. Norton can greet the destruction of "civilization" as a matter of indifference, not merely because he does not understand it as bound up as part of a higher order whose end is God. Rather, he can remain indifferent, because he is alienated from it, even as he asserts a certain responsibility for it as the president of one of its distinguished, and threatened, institutions.</page><page sequence="19">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 67 These passing critiques of Babbitt and Norton indicate that Eliot saw com munity as the exclusive place inside of which traditions of ethical and religious belief can flourish. When it is lost, Christian ethics and religion remain, but as substitutes and artificialities called Stoicism and humanism. From Critical Diagnosis to Communal Drama In 1934, Eliot's first verse play, The Rock, premiered, the funds it raised to be given in support of the construction of forty-five new churches in the Diocese of London. This circumstance alone intimates much of what the play says outright or tries to effect in its very form. Eliot, as a poet, had cultivated the dignified, austere, and isolated presentation of his work dur ing the previous two decades. The typographic manipulations of The Waste Land bespeak a poem intended to be looked at by the solitary reader rather than read aloud—however beautifully in fact it might read. He published individual poems piecemeal in journals, and republished them in limited edition booklets, all of which suggested at once that they were addressed to an elite coterie readership but also that the poems stood alone, in precious isolation. But Eliot repeatedly expressed doubts about this mode of publica tion, precisely because of its limited audience. He wished to reach a broader swath of society and for some part of his work to serve a commensurately social function, and he believed the drama to be the most promising means to that end {The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism 146). Even by its flyleaf, The Rock directly gestured toward its social use, its sta tus as communal event. It was written explicitly as a pageant to benefit the Anglican Church—for the sake, in other words, of an ecclesial and sacral community, where a shared life in a particular church building embodies the revealed truth of the church itself. In the text's "Prefatory Note," Eliot insists, "I cannot consider myself the author of the 'play,' but only of the words which are printed here" (5). He then proceeds to list the many hands who contributed the scenario, various ideas, details, or words to the play. It is not his play, because he is only its primary author; it exists for the com munity and in performance—thus, it could not be appropriated as part of his bound poetic work. E. Martin Browne, in fact, had contributed most of the plot's content, which Eliot's words made flesh—the true task for the poet, according to Eliot, but a collaborative and workman-like one as well.18 As such, the play text would never be republished, and Eliot would only preserve the Choruses, which were his work alone, even though some of them become obscure severed from their dramatic context, and even though he would collect the fragmentary Sweeney Agonistes and his later plays</page><page sequence="20">68 Religion &amp; Literature with his verse in the Complete Poems and Plays. In the age of Bertolt Brecht, with his communist theater in Germany, and the Group Theater of Rupert Doone in England, gestures of collaboration and communal ownership were common. But Eliot avoided the modish modesty of disclaiming the work he had done, even as he also carefully preserved the play-as-event as something belonging to the community of which he was a part. Thus, the truly communal bears with it a sense of self-giving and belonging that the communistic artwork evidently did not.19 The content of the play reinforces its communal identity. It is a pageant play, after all, and so its form does not derive from the interior exigencies of plot, but merely from whatever events may be found in a community's shared history. As E. Martin Browne, the author of the scenario and first director of all Eliot's plays, commented, a pageant play's purpose is to celebrate the history either of a place or of an institution, and it does so by showing a chronological series of scenes, each led up to by a processional entry...The total effect can hardly be called dramatic; it is a display of panoply, a more relaxed and less disciplined version of a great parade. (4)20 This ragtag, episodic shape allows Eliot to combine at least three dramatic antecedents that have in common only their public, communal function. Importantly, the play excludes another antecedent. Neither The Rock nor any of Eliot's plays would seek to emulate the Elizabethan dramatic forms (though they do contain frequent references to the Shakespearean stage).21 Rather, as I suggested above, the language and imagery of the Elizabethan dramatists would inform chiefly his dark, early lyrics of discontent and alienation: raw, violent poems for isolated Stoics seeking to cheer themselves up by libeling the universe.22 His avoidance of the iambic pentameter in the drama has often enough been remarked upon, but his avoidance of the plot-driven, five-act horror filled rhetorical spectacle (the "drama of blood") that Eliot investigates in his essay on Seneca is no less important.23 He turns for models to the Greek tragedy, the medieval mystery plays (particularly Everyman, which he had praised as classical and elegant compared to Seneca), and the modern music hall, just past its prime in the working class sections of London. The best known parts of the play, the Choruses, are stiff and rhythmic, as reminis cent of the parallel structure of the psalms as they are of the Choruses of Greek Tragedy; moreover, they are redundant like the former even as they serve the same dramatic function as the latter, orienting us to the thematic meaning of the scenes they bookend: The world turns and the world changes,</page><page sequence="21">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 69 But one thing does not change. In all of my years, one thing does not change. However you disguise it, this thing does not change: The perpetual struggle of Good and Evil. (9) Appearing almost as frequently as do these sober Choruses is a trio of workmen building a church: Ethelbert, Alfred, and Edwin. Their cockney accents, carefully transcribed into the script, evoke at once the vernacular of the medieval mystery plays, which were the popular entertainment of their day, and the music hall sketches that Eliot regularly attended and celebrated in his essay on the great music hall personality, Marie Lloyd (Selected Essays 369-72). Various other tableaux unfold, all of which derive from English ecclesial history. These include an extended defense of the ideals and cardinal virtues of the crusaders that quietly identifies them with the veterans of the Great War, and also a scene depicting the first bishop of London Mellitus's conversion of the pagan king of London, Sabert, at the turn from the Roman to the Christian era (16-18).24 The play's "panoply" thus allows Eliot to include whatever episodes he thinks his audience ought already to know, already to consider a part of its communal patrimony, and therefore, what it ought already to share. Just as the Greeks knew well the stories their dramatists depicted, Eliot seeks to show his contemporary Anglican audience that it, too, holds stories in common; its members, too, know the same things and derive from the same past. They also share the same present, laugh at the same jokes, and grasp the same varied political references to social credit theory, class war, and anti-Semitic fascism (The Rock 42-44).25 They have this much in common, because they also believe in the same God, have received his revelation, and look to dwell eternally in his Truth. Thus, the second Chorus admon ishes the ecclesial community regarding its fluid existence as the church on earth but also the Body of Christ in heaven. To those who protest, "Our citizenship is in Heaven," the Chorus replies, "yes, but that is the model and type for your citizenship upon earth" (20). The church leaves neither the world behind nor its past: "Of all that was done in the past, you eat the fruit, either rotten or ripe." And so, here, Eliot provides a brief catechism in ethics, listing the sins and the goods of life in the temporal church. The Chorus's argument culminates in a claim that Eliot's meditations on Stoicism prepare us to accept as not bare assertion but studied certainty: What life have you if you have not life together? There is no life that is not in community, And no community not lived in praise of GOD. (21)</page><page sequence="22">70 Religion de Literature This assertion the Chorus holds up in contrast with modern life, where "no man knows or cares who is his neighbor / Unless his neighbor makes too much disturbance." We are all Stoics of a sort now, content to protect our private wills within the "motor cars" of our mobile selves, "Familiar with the roads and settled nowhere." The free domination of space is bought at the price of our ceasing to belong to others and our surrendering our citizenship of particular places. Consequently, modern persons do not live in community, for though they "have shelters and institutions," modern citizens have "no homes" (30). They are not citizens in the Greek under standing of that word. As we have seen, the Greek polis was a community constituted by its pursuit of the Good and the good life; the citizens lived together because they shared the same end (telos). But what rationale, the Chorus asks, corrals the modern masses of London? When the Stranger says: "What is the meaning of this city? Do you huddle close together because you love each other?" What will you answer? "We all dwell together To make money from each other"? (30-31) The sense of a shared good is absent. The conflicting private goods of fear, consumption, and profit replace it, while an external "fence" of law limits this chaos and gives it form. The compound of private freedom and anonymity, and the absence of a public "meaning" for the city leads to a legalistic utopianism. Following Scheler, Eliot suggests that Stoic individu alism finds modern expression in a rationalized and procedural Kantian liberalism that leads human beings constantly [to] try to escape From the darkness outside and within By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good. (42)26 As we noted earlier, for the Stoic, only the isolated individual will and the totalized order have meaningful existence: thus, self and system, private desire and public law, are the units of the "liberal Stoic" social planner. The criticisms of the anthropology and "new science of politics" in modern life that fill much of The Rock find their center in the theological vision outlined in the Chorus that begins Part II of the play.27 There, Eliot provides his account of the creation of the world. While many details de rive from the first creation story in Genesis, the creation of mankind does not appear as a late or culminating moment in Eliot's account as it does there, nor does it linger on the eternal priority of the divine Word's unity with the Father before turning to his descent into the world, as does John's</page><page sequence="23">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 71 Gospel (Gen 1:26-27; John 1:1-13). Rather, Eliot closely follows the story of the creation given by St. Paul in his speech to the Athenians, where the eternally prior creative act of God giving being to things is dramatically counterpointed by man's groping toward God.28 So, Eliot writes, In the beginning GOD created the world. Waste and void. Waste and void. And darkness was upon the face of the deep. And when there were men, in their various ways, they struggled in torment towards GOD. (49) By excluding from his creation narrative the making of man, Eliot has God move toward man by creating the world, and man, as a communal being, move toward God by seeking in torment "Blindly and vainly," as if they were originally distinct forces headed from the beginning of time toward intersection (49). Presumably, St. Paul's intention had been to show to the pagan Greeks, who were "very religious," that they too had been seeking the God of Jesus Christ though they did not know it. Eliot harnesses the Pauline creation account to suggest that the journey to God is one of cult, culture, and community. Man seeks God first in primitive animist religion, and "the Spirit moved upon the face of the water." Man invents "the Higher Religions," moving ever closer to the light of God but also arriving at "a dead end stirred with a flicker of life" (50). His communal journey toward God is marred not by individual error, but by the falling-into-superstition of communities themselves. Evil appears in the Chorus not in respect to individual sins, but as the slow acquisition of communal "knowledge of Good and Evil" (49). It speaks of "Prayer wheels, worship of the dead, denial of this world, affirmation of rites with forgotten meanings," that is, of once living traditions ossifying into laws passively accepted—precisely that Stoic condition Eliot had elsewhere described. Such moments of decay included, he dramatizes historical progress, which is always headed toward the encounter of man with God. Then, at last, collision comes: Then came, at a predetermined moment, a moment in time and of time, A moment not out of time, but in time, in what we call history; transecting, bisect ing the world of time, a moment in time but not like a moment of time. A moment in time but time was made through that moment: for without the meaning there is no time and that moment of time gave the meaning. Then it seemed as if men must proceed from light to light, in the light of the Word, Through the Passion and Sacrifice saved in spite of their negative being (50) God and man have been headed toward each other from the beginning of time and they finally meet in that singular moment of Christ's incarnation.</page><page sequence="24">72 Religion &lt;fe Literature Such an event is not only the intersection of the historical and the eternal and of the human and divine; it is the place where the "facts" of temporal existence become one with their meaning or significance. Anticipating the critique of natural reason in "East Coker" and the account of historical experience in "Dry Salvages" (125, 132-33), Eliot thus indicates that the natural order is not fully intelligible without divine revelation. The wisdom of experience is of limited value; only the revelation that is Christ's incarnation can tell us the truth about what our lives have meant.29 If this meeting-and meaning point is literally Christ, it is also the Body of Christ, the church. For only the church manifests in unity the human person as member of a historical community and as member of a sacral community. The church's life is incarnation continued. Eliot's creation narrative puts the historical community in motion simulta neously with the movement of God's creation and self-revelation. Indeed, on balance, Eliot's phrasing suggests that, far from the church as passive receiver of God's meaning, the church as community moves toward "the light of the Word" just as the light moves toward it. Thus, community is not merely the condition of possibility for life or for the moral life, as we saw above—it is also the prerequisite for the religious life. God does not reveal himself to man merely as a pre-social individual, but man as part of that particular, grappling, and imperfect entity called the church. Only in the church, in the historico-sacral community, can the human person live to discover the truth, the meaning, about himself. Eliot would appropriately conclude his volume on the Idea of a Christian Society with the claim that the "Church has perpetually to answer this question: to what purpose were we born? What is the end of man?" (Christianity and Culture 77). The implication here is not that the church has an ahistorical authority in asking such questions, as if it possessed a privileged "view from nowhere"; rather, because of the church's identity as the incarnation of a particular community oriented toward the universal truth of God, there alone can these questions productively be posed. The church, as community, becomes the oracle of God's revelation as well as its receiver. Just as St. Paul had sought to make Christianity and salvation history intelligible to the pagans of the Hellenistic period, Eliot's Chorus attempts to make that history intelligible to a society no longer Chris tian, whose history is Christian history, but which has grown indifferent to it. What was once Christendom must not be "converted" but, rather, must rediscover its identity as a community through this shared history However vast the British Empire, that rediscovery must be made at the incarnational level of the particular parish and the local community (cf. Kojecky 164 and Spurr 196-201). Indeed, Eliot viewed the smallest of communities, extended family, as a sort of domestic church and the chief entity for the transmission</page><page sequence="25">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 73 of religion and culture from one generation to another (To Criticize the Critic 113-14). This point was driven home performatively in The Rock, during its two-week run, the pageant's recital of English history culminates in an Anglican bishop coming onto stage to bless the audience (Malamud 36). Eliot qualifies this account of ecclesiastic and communal revelation in two ways, however, that distinguish it from the contemporary ideologies of communism and fascism, to which The Rock serves as a reply, and also from the antecedents of those ideologies found in romanticism. First, at the end of Part I, after Redshirts and Blackshirts parade on stage and reveal themselves, respectively, as crude materialists and anti-Semitic racists, the Chorus addresses the audience: We speak to you as individual men; As individuals alone with GOD. Alone with God, you first learn brotherhood with men. (46) As is evident from his comments to Dobrée, Eliot views the love of God as giving form and meaning to human relationships and not the reverse. The modern ideologies, including what Babbitt decried as liberal humanitari anism, reduce the divine to the social, the supernatural to the natural, and eternal meaning to historical experience. But Christian brotherhood and "individual" personhood is irreducible within the divine economy, in con tradistinction from what Eliot viewed as the "secular" religions of liberalism, communism, and fascism, which annihilated the person in favor of a blind legal equality, a classless collectivity, and the collective personhood of the nation-state (Cf. Selected Essays 366).30 And second, in The Rock and his later social criticism, Eliot seems aware that the compelling force of his vision of historical and sacral community will be blunted if we try to read it in terms of romantic nostalgia for an organic society that may be ahistorical and, in any case, may not now exist. He does not here argue for the superiority of one historical state of society over another. He insists, rather, that life within a particular community "to gether" is the condition of possibility for the reception of divine revelation and the discovery of those conceptions of the good that provide the telos for ethics. As he had observed while lecturing at the University of Virginia a few months before he wrote The Rock, "the same people living in the same place" beget "all those habitual actions, habits and customs, from the most significant religious rite to our conventional way of greeting a stranger" that compose a tradition; and, as Maclntyre has contended, it is only within a tradition that conceptions of the good can be meaningfully deliberated (After Strange Gods 18-19). Without the ecclesial or sacred community intact,</page><page sequence="26">74 Religion de Literature one cannot begin or develop a tradition of ethical thought; when a com munity's "common code is detached from its theological background, and is consequently more and more merely a matter of habit," it becomes vulner able to what may appear as change but is in fact decay (Essays Ancient and. Modern 93). This ethics on the down-slope, Eliot acknowledges—in another essay from the period, "Religion and Literature"—as "a kind of morality," but it is parasitic (114). It derives from traditions that once had flourished, but which, as they wither, lead to an ethics lingering on after the loss of community and the desiccation of tradition: we are left once more in pos session of "rites with forgotten meanings." To point out this phenomenon is not intrinsically nostalgic and would seem a prescient warning about the inelasticity of flourishing human societies in an age that tended to believe new social "systems" could be "planned" from above by liberal elites.31 Conclusion: Revisions of Community fiom Canterbury to Rome With some sympathy, Eliot appreciated that Stoicism was a natural product of communal decline; he understood that alienation and slavish insecurity would generally occur; and it is evident that in places his work suffers this condition even as it rebukes it. But, in the 1930s, with the rise of the communists, fascists, and national socialists, he also understood that Stoicism's exclusive aggrandizement of the will could take other, more ma levolent forms. A commitment to the flourishing of an organic community and a shared conception of the good did not lead to the violent ideologies about to sweep Europe even as he finished his pageant play in support of the construction of churches. Rather, he reminds us, these things were the sole sources of life—without which we can scarcely think ethically. Only a year after The Rock's two-week run, Eliot would feel compelled to shift the weight of his emphasis from communal life to individual responsibil ity before God, in Murder in the Cathedral (1935). While that play would enact community in many of the same dramaturgic ways as does The Rock, its plot highlights the individual decision that each person must make before his fel low man and before God, drawing yet a more stark contrast between Eliot's vision of Christian life and the mass culture of the modern ideologies whose presence no longer simply reacted to the undermined communal traditions of modern Europe but endangered the life of every person. If Murder in the Cathedral has earned the reputation as Eliot's greatest play, its focus on the solitary person's moral choice is more stark and less concerned with com munal redemption than are his other dramatic works. Indeed, Murder in the CathedraH focus on Becket's spiritual quest may lead us to underestimate</page><page sequence="27">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 75 how much the later plays return questions of community to center stage, or to overlook Four Quartets's reflection on the soul's journey through this world and into God in the contexts of intimate friendship ("Burnt Norton"), of communal village life ("East Coker" and "The Dry Salvages"), and of religious and national life ("Litde Gidding"). And yet, Eliot's vision of the sacral community would never find bolder expression than it did in The Rock, in the performance of which, we have reason to believe, the idea became the reality. Villanova University NOTES 1. For Eliot's proleptic response to such charges, see T. S. Eliot, Essays Ancient and Modern 107-08.

Eliot and Russell Kirk." 3. This fragmentary drama is Eliot's first play. It was published in 1926 and performed in the same year as The Rock (1934), but by a very different company. As we shall see, The Rock had been commissioned by Bishop George Bell to benefit a church building campaign in London; Sweeney was produced by Rupert Doone's Group Theatre, an institution chiefly allied with leftist and avant-garde movements in England. 4. For instances of the Bloomsbury ethics of friendship, see E. M. Forster's "What I Be lieve" in Two Cheersfor Democracy and G. E. Moore's Principia Ethica § 113. Alasdair Maclntyre critiques this "emotivist" ethics of sincerity in After Virtue 14-16. 5. See Lyndall Gordon, who defines his life as a search for the "timeless moment" de scribed in his juvenile poem, "Silence" (23), and his willingness to cast aside Vivienne Eliot (283), Emily Hale (394), and John Hayward (511), each of whom could accompany him only so far on the way. 6. Gordon's biography is critical of this tendency in Eliot, but it also fits in well with her effort to remake him in the model of an American transcendentalist. Her approach to Eliot's spiritual growth has been justly disputed in Spurr 29. 7. Part II of "Burnt Norton" begins, "Garlic and sapphires in the mud / Clot the bed ded axle-tree," and continues, We move above the moving tree In light upon the figured leaf And hear upon the sodden floor Below, the boarhound and the boar Pursue their pattern as before But reconciled among the stars. (Complete Poems and Plays 119)</page><page sequence="28">76 Religion &amp; Literature The trope of eternal cosmic cycles expressed in more minute circling movements recurs also in "Gerontion": "whirled / Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear" (23); in the cosmos rotating on the "axletree" in "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar" (24); in the eternal cycles of succession in nature, which is the problem with which "East Coker" grapples (123-24); and in "The Dry Salvages," which describes, in contrast, the terror of the infinite, straight length of geological time that does not repeat but extends ad nauseum (130-31). 8. Etienne Gilson dilates on this point in his introduction to St. Augustine's The City of God: The two cities are alike contained in a single universe whose head is its Creator, God. Contrary to the Stoics, however, St. Augustine did not conceive of the universe as a city. Never did he speak of the cosmos as the City of God in the same sense as a Stoic could speak of it as the City of Zeus. For Augustine, a society can exist only among beings endowed with reason. That is why we have seen him posit the universe as the stage on which the history of societies unfolds; and if on more than one point the universe is affected by this history, it is not precisely its own proper history. In this sense, Augustine profoundly differs from the Stoics. When he speaks of a city, he has in mind not an order of things but a veritable society. (Introduction 30) As I have already suggested, and as I shall consider presently, the possibility of a Christian Stoicism relies largely on how we interpret St. Augustine's debt to the Stoics. While schol ars have long accepted his adaptation of Stoic ideas, I propose that those ideas are always transformed substantially in Augustine's use of them. 9. John Milton's Satan comforts himself in hell: "The mind is its own place, and in itself / Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n" (Complete Poems and Major Prose 217). Early in The Confessions, Augustine recalls the sense of happiness and completion he felt in an early friendship. When the friend dies, he is thrown back upon himself and concludes, after the manner of the Stoics, "it appeared to me that unity, in which the rational mind subsisted, was itself the essence of truth and of the supreme good" (4, 15, 24). He eventually discovers that he "needed to be open to the radiance of another light in order to become a partaker in truth," that truth lies not in the mind but in God (4, 15, 25). Importantly, Augustine would carry a Stoic understanding of evil as derived exclusively from the disordered human will into his Christian life (e.g. "On Free Will" I, 10 [Augustine: Ear lier Writings 118-19]). This Stoic account of what is good Augustine absorbs and transcends over the course of the work, and leads him eventually to an anthropology that understands the Christian virtue of charity and the life of the church (the City of God) as more central to salvation than he did in his early work, where the Platonic ascent beyond time and Stoic individualism seem to have retained some hold upon him (O'Connell 52). 10. Pascal writes, This is our true state; this is what makes us incapable of certain knowledge and of absolute ignorance. We sail within a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end. When we think to attach ourselves to any point and to fasten to it, it wavers and leaves us; and if we follow it, it eludes our grasp, slips past us, and vanishes for ever. (19) 11. Pascal's Christian vision takes other persons and social life into account in two, pri marily negative, ways. The "external" elements of religion, which he identifies as kneeling and prayer with the lips, but by implication the Mass, exist primarily to humble the proud, who would otherwise arrogate all religion to the interior life of the mind (73); thus, praying aloud does not do anything in itself, but serves to negate the otherwise totalitarian drive to</page><page sequence="29">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON 77 interiorize and spiritualize Christianity. Social life in general serves Pascal as simply a great panorama of humanity's fallen reason and injustice and thus serves to remind us that truth and justice are found truly only in God (83-86). External prayer humbles the proud, tempo ral injustice turns us away from temporal hopes, and so we come poor and begging to the Father. If the church or Christian society exercise a positive function in Pascal, it is that of providing the unthinking "customs" that prepare the soul to receive the gift of faith and to believe in God; but, again, this is extrinsic to faith and leaves one presuming that the graced believer no longer requires the church save as a stumbling block to pride. 12. Webb's essay should be understood as a riposte in its own right to Kantian liberal appropriations of Stoicism, such as that of Martha Nussbaum discussed below. Understand ably, Webb seeks to reclaim the Stoic notion of the logos, the rational order of nature, as a domain of absolute truths that stands in contrast with the relativism and "multiculturalism" of the contemporary left. ShifTman's critique rightly suggests that the Stoic conception of truth and order is hardly the only or the best one available and that, as a matter of history, it subtends Enlightenment and contemporary liberalism alike and so does not lend itself to the reforms Webb desires. 13. Eliot quotes the full passage of which these lines are a part in "The Metaphysical Poets" (Selected Essays 246). Cf. Matthews for a rich consideration of the role of Chapman and Elizabethan stoicism in Eliot's development as a poet. 14. Lewis A. Coser, in his Introduction to Ressentiment, proposes this vulnerability to the argument (23). 15. Eliot knew and admired Scheler's work, and may have been adapting this particular critique in his essays. In addition to Eliot's many contacts with continental sociologists from his years editing The Criterion onward, Eliot published a translation of one of Scheler's essays in The Criterion the year after his essays on Seneca appeared (Scheler "The Future of Man"). Further, Scheler's work bore a significant influence on T. E. Hulme, whose cultural theories Eliot held dear (See Schüller 7, 13, 53, and 168). 16. If the phrasing of the social sciences ("samples" or "facts") sounds crude, it serves to suggest Maclntyre's quiet response to and revision of the empiricist ethics of David Hume. 17. Eliot's reference to Nietzsche and condescending analysis of Othello and Hamlet could be directed just as easily at the poems of the Imagistes. See, for instance Ezra Pound's "Reflection," which refers to Nietzsche (Collected Early Poems 286), or any of the other early lyrics from the romantic Stoicism of "A Tree" and "La Fraisne" or the more austere exercises of Stoic "logic" that Pound begins as imitations of Chinese verse, such as "Fan Piece, for Her Imperial Lord," 'Alba," and "Coitus" (Personae.). See also H.D.'s early lyrics, especially "Sea Rose" for the most obvious modernist adaptation of Stoic selfhood to the sensibility of the twentieth century (Collected Poems, 5). 18. Eliot would write that the task of the poet and of poetry "is not the assertion that something is true, but the making that truth more fully real to us; it is the creation of a sensu ous embodiment. It is the making the Word Flesh, if we remember that for poetry there are various qualities of Word and various qualities of Flesh" ("Poetry and Propaganda" 601). Cf. Eliot, The Varieties of Metaphysical Poetry 54-55, 61. From this enduring perspective, the "crank-turning" work on The Rock was not a descent of the poet into didactic and social ef forts but the purest form of poetic composition in which the poet's task is entirely restricted to giving flesh to someone else's words (ideas). 19. Eliot's career as a writer lends itself to interpretation as a wholly communal or collaborative endeavor, as Richard Badenhausen has shown in 77 S. Eliot and the Art of Col laboration (2004). 20. Eliot subsequently deprecated pageant plays in a lecture on religious drama: "You</page><page sequence="30">Religion &amp; Literature may even think of them [religious plays] as you may think of pageants—as performances which give a great deal more pleasure to the people taking part in them (especially if the costumes are interesting) than to the audience" ("Religious Drama: Medieval and Modern" 8). Thus, even on the side of the artists and performers, the play is social. 21. There are evident references to Shakespeare and the Elizabethans in each of Eliot's plays. The weird ladies of Macbeth and the "policy" of the stock Elizabethan stage villain crop up in Murder in the Cathedral (1935) (Complete Poems and Plays 186). Kyd's Spanish Tragedy and Hamlet inform Eliot's portrayal of the Eumenides in The Family Reunion (1939). The Senecan drama of blood (see below) is parodied in Celia's martyrdom in The Cocktail Party (1950); the plot of secret identities and lost children, rife in Shakespeare, is adopted in The Confidential Clerk (1954); and fang Lear provides a source for the character of Lord Claverton in The Elder Statesman (1959). 22. See especially The Waste Land, "Gerontian," and Eliot's quatrain poems. The concept of Stoicism as Eliot developed it in his essays helps explain his later dismissive reference to The Waste Land as "only the relief of a personal and wholly insignificant grouse against life; it is just a piece of rhythmical grumbling" (The Waste Land: A Facsimile and Transcript 1). Mat thews has profitably explored the interrelation between Eliot's poetic method, especially his use of allusion, the metaphysical poets, and early modern Stoicism. 23. In discussing the Senecan-influenced drama of blood, he observes, "When we consider it, and reflect how much more refined, how much more classical in the profounder sense, is that earlier popular drama which reached its highest point in Everyman, I cannot but think that the change is due to some fundamental release of restraint" (Selected Essays 68). See, however, n 21 above. 24. It is worth noting that Bert, or Ethelbert, provides a "demotic" account of the cyclical theories of history found in Vico and Spengler, and which James Joyce and Eliot were practic ing in their modernist art works—what Eliot called the "mythical method" (See Eliot Selected Prose 178). Bert says, "There's some new notion about time, what says that the past—what's be'ind you—is what's goin' to 'appen in the future, bein' as the future 'as already 'appened" [The Rock 15-16). This serves to excuse the anachronistic tableaux that punctuate the play, but also reinforces the continuity of Eliot's poetics as one of communally shared historical traditions rather than elite intellectual allusiveness. To drive the point home, Ethelbert was also the name of the uncle of Sabert, King of London. Browne attributes the time-structure of the play not to Eliot's mythical method but to J. W. Dunne's An Experiment with Time (1927) (9). This seems an odd claim given the clear congruence with the structure of the play, Eliot's early poetry and theory, as well as the temporal theory in "Burnt Norton"—which has also been attributed to Dunne, but more obviously draws on Saint Augustine's Confessions XI. 25. Eliot wrote to Dobrée, who was one of the minor collaborators on the play, that the only particular curiosity he had about its reception was to what extent his audience would detect these references (Dobrée 83). 26. The association between Stoicism and post-Kantian liberalism has not been made only by their critics. Martha Nussbaum's "Patriotism and Cosmopolitanism" celebrates the Stoic cosmopolitan as the truly moral being who has transcended the "immoral" and benighted conditions of local attachments in order to enter into a universal citizenship closer to Kant than Diogenes, thus further suggesting the salience of Eliot's doubts about such deracinated aspirations, ancient or modern. Ancient Stoics, of course, presumed an already-achieved perfect rational order. The modern liberal as Stoic presumes that this order lies still in the future as a utopia; but, as Eliot's verse suggests, the liberal Stoic dreams of the attainment of that order as a moment when all growth and change will cease and the will</page><page sequence="31">JAMES MATTHEW WILSON may thereafter accept the rationalized order as given. 27. A critique of modern politics as Utopian and "Gnostic" in line with Eliot's criticisms in The Rock can be found in Russell Kirk's writings (including his biography of Eliot), but also in the reflections on modernity in the work of Erich Voegelin, especially the books collected as Modernity without Restraint. 28. "From one ancestor He [God] made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him—though indeed he is not far from each one of us" (Acts 17:26-27). 29. This is also the central theme of Murder in the Cathedral, in which only the liturgi cal vision of history held by the church allows one to see the intelligible form of historical experience, as Beckett explains in his first speech and in his sermon (Complete Poems and Plays 182, 198-200). In an early edition of the play, a scene Eliot later deleted would highlight the nature of feast days as those moments when the Word penetrates history and makes time meaningful (Murder in the Cathedral 54-56). 30. Eliot's last play, The Elder Statesman, will expand, even at the risk of reversing, the position on human love expressed to Dobrée and the relation of natural history and su pernatural meaning found in The Rock and Murder in the Cathedral. There, he will insist that human romantic love—the love found in a natural community—is a preparation for the acceptance of divine love and salvation (See Smith 214). 31.
