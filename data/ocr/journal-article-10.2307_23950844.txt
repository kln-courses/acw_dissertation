<plain_text><page sequence="1">34i NOTES AND STUDIES THE SONG OF DEBORAH In previous notes contributed to this Journal 1 my theory of ' Repeti tion and Antiphony' in ancient Hebrew poetry has been gradually developed, and applied mainly to a number of difficult texts in the Psalms. Elsewhere * I have attempted to show that repetition was even more prevalent than a superficial reading of M.T. would suggest Reduplication, I maintained, was. sometimes indicated by leaving blank spaces, on the stone or clay tablet, under the words to be repeated, and these spaces were naturally omitted when the matter was transferred to expensive vellum scrolls. Although no such Hebrew tablets survived, the spade of the excavators has brought to light a number of clay tablets, prepared by the contemporaries of the ancient Hebrews, on which this mode of arrangement is actually to be seen. Since the assumption of the theory of ' Repetition and Antiphony ' or ' Repetition, Antiphony, and Blanks ' removes many difficulties of metre and text in O.T., there is no reason to doubt that similar tablets were in use among the Hebrews whose scribes would not hesitate to lessen their labour by employing methods and modes of writing that were in vogue among their neighbours. Whether the Hebrews borrowed from, or lent to, the Babylonians or the Egyptians, or whether each of these peoples invented the art and the practice independently, is of no consequence to the validity of this theory. Whether the Hebrews were borrowers or lenders there can now hardly be any doubt that had it not been for the long Leidensgeschichte, and the irreparable losses, of Israel's literary treasures, such records might have come down to us together with those of the other peoples of the East.* The theory mentioned may, I believe, be applied with advantage not only to the Psalms but to other portions of the O.T. ; and the object of the present note is to attempt a solution, on the lines of this theory, of some of the more difficult passages of the Song of Deborah which is 1 Cf. my ' Stichometry and Text of the Great Hallel J.T.S., vol. xxix pp. 255 268;.

A. Smith, is varied. Some of its divisions ' have two accents to the line and others three, and a few four while three of the couplets are in ' Kinah proportion of three to two'.4 Burney thinks that the 'four-beat measure'' which 'is well recognized in Hebrew'' and the 'three-beat measure' are the most prominent in the Ode, three-eighths of the poem being cast in the former and about five-eighths in the latter. But, he admits, the poem contains distichs composed in the 3 + 4 as well as in the 4 + 3 metre.' Proceeding, however, on the lines of our theory, most of the difficulties difficulties encountered by critics and commentators seem to vanish; and the whole Ode, moreover, or, at any rate, most of it, may be shown to have been constructed in the regular metre of 3 + 3. As an illustration, the following passages, generally recognized as extremely difficult may be taken. Judges ν 6, בימי שסגר גן ענת בימי יעל חדלו ארחות והלכי נתיבות ילכו ארחות עקלקלות Moore7 agrees with Briggs that the second ארחות ' is erroneously repeated from the preceding line, to the detriment of both poetical expression and the rhythm'. Sievers8 rejects בן ענת because it 'durchbricht den hier herrschenden dipodischen Rhythmus und 1st also ziemlich sicher eine genealogische Glosse'.' G. A. Smith10 is doubtful as to the retention of these two words. If, however, they are to be retained, he says, the couplet in which they occur will have to be 1 Cf. Β. Dubm Ε. Bi.

A. Smith also regards these two words as ' probably a gloss '.3 As regards ארחות, already mentioned, G.A. Smith4 suggests a change of the Massoretic vowels. Sievers, like Moore, deletes the second ארחות, pointing out6 that Ley and others are of the same opinion, because it is regarded ' als storende Wiederholung'. Against the opinion of Budde, Sievers asserts that the second או־חות ' durchbricht wirklich den dipodi schen Rhythmus der Stelle', and ' wiirde einen ganz unmotivierten umgekehrten Fiinfer hervorrufen '.6 Judges ν 6, accordingly, appears in Sievers's arrangement' as follows : || חדלו ארחות I [בימי שמנו־ [בן ענת בימי יעל והלכי נתיבות! ילכו [ארחות] עקלקלות: This reduces a verse of thirteen words to eight.

Moore,4 dealing with the last three words of the verse, considers it probable that 'what originally stood here formed the end (predicate) of the second stichos of v. 21, the repetition of the words stream of Kishon being a gloss to the subject'. An alternative quoted by Moore5 is 'that a line has been lost', but he does not commit himself as to what that line may have been. G. A. Smith's rendering," shows no proper parallelism between the first and second stichos, and none whatever between either of these and the third. Proceeding, however, on the lines of our thesis, we observe first, that the vv. which immediately precede v. 21, viz. vv. 19 and 20, as well as 22 .ע which follows, are constructed as double trimeters' and, secondly, that they, as well as v. 21, exhibit quite a number of repetitions. Furthermore, the author's fondness for repetition is apparent throughout the Song.8 We are thus prepared to allow further repetitions in the verse under discussion and to regard it also, if possible, as having once consisted of trimeters. The following arrangement seems to supply both regular trimeter distichs and perfect parallelism; and in addition, avoids the difficulties referred to above. 1 Cf. R.V. marg.

Indeed, had Sievers carried this principle a little further, he would also have obtained a regular metre for the whole verse—a metre which is predominant throughout the Song. He would also have noted that there may have been no ' Verderbnis' at all in the text. There is, moreover, no need to regard the verse, with G. A. Smith, as 'a quatrain by itself', and to delete with him the word מלאך for metrical reasons.7 The original arrangement may have been the following: [Ditto[Ditto signs = blanks] אמר מלאך הי אורו מרוז 3 + 3 ארור 11 11 11 אורו ישביה 3 + 3 לעזרת ה' בגבורים כי לא באו לעזרת ה' 3 + 3 Translation.Translation.

Smith," on the other hand, retains the stichos and rejects, instead, the first five words of the verse, which, he asserts, make an 1 odd line' in a tetra meter distich. ,The text', he says, ,adds a long 5-stressed line ... which is wanting in eighteen MSS, and all but " he lay " in eight others ; and may be due to dittography." Sievers,4 however, retains M.T. and only finds it necessary to ascribe to it the irregular metre of 4:3, 4. On the lines of our thesis the original form of recital may have been the following: 3 + 3 בין רגליה כרע נפל נפל שכב בין רגליה 3 + 3 בין רגליה כרע נפל נפל באשר כרע 3 + 3 בין רגליה כרע נפל שם נפל שרוד This form not only presents regular metre and perfect balance, but vividly ,hebt mit einer gewissen innern Befriedigung die einzelnen Momente seines Todes heraus '.5 With Nowack we may say that ' mit Recht hat man in dieser Wildheit des Affektes einen Beweis fur die Gleichzeitigkeit des Liedes gesehen'.· The eighteen, and the eight MSS, mentioned by G. A. Smith, supra, may have preserved for us two shortened (written) forms just as M.T., which is fuller than these MSS, has preserved a third, which is also a shortened written form of the full form of recital.

Smith' treat this verse as a tetrameter tetrastich and, as a result, the subject, mother of Sisera, is separated4 from its two predicates in the first stichos, and is placed into the second stichos where it is joined to an adverbial clause (which limits the verbs) of the previous stichos. This arrangement can hardly be regarded as natural. Moore8 justifies the separation of subject from predicate on the ground that ' the effect of the transition is heightened by the postponement of the explicit subject to the second clause'. This, however, does not very well explain the combination into one stichos of the subject and one of the adverbial clauses, vis. אם סיסרא בעד האשנב By reading as follows we obtain better parallelism, regular metre, as well as clear and natural clauses: 3 + 3 בעד החלון נשקפה ותיבב אם סיסרא 3+3 בעד האשנב « „ ״ ״״ 3+3 מדוע בשש רכבו בשש רכבו לבוא6 3 + 3 מדוע אחרו פעמי אחרו פעמי מרכבותיו' 1 Cf.

The passages of the ode dealt with here are, it is hoped, sufficient illustration of the applicability of our thesis to others, which need not, therefore, be discussed at this juncture. It should be added, however, that the assumption of the original existence of blanks on clay tablets is not a vital factor in the thesis. It helps in many cases in the restora tion of the full form of recital and also in accounting for the shorter versions of M.T. But where this arrangement cannot easily be dis covered, the shortness of M.T. may be explained by the simple assump tion that the mode of recital was so familiar that the copyist did not think it necessary to repeat words which were well known to the readers of his text.
