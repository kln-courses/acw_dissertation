<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROLEGOMENA TO CHRISTOLOGY w: rHERE the Incarnation is concerned, according to traditional Christian teaching, we have to do with that which is alleged to be unique. The term—the Incarnation—is a definite descrip tion, the function of the definite article in the phrase expressing it being that of asserting uniqueness of reference. That to which we refer as the the Incarnation takes place once for all; but what is it for such an event to take place ? Indeed what are we saying when we speak of it as an event ? Here is focused the question of the relation of the temporal to the eternal, of man to God, of Christ to God. Historical events, for instance the premiership of Neville Chamberlain are unique; unique in the sense of occurring within a particular region of space at a particular time, standing within identifiable relations of con temporaneity, anteriority, and posteriority to other events, etc. They may also be qualitatively unique: in that we say of many such events that nothing precisely or even vaguely like this has happened before, or will happen again. Such events as Chamberlain's premiership are of course inherently complex, and when we speak of their qualitative uniqueness, the quality to which we refer is a Gestaltqualitat or pattern-quality such as, to take a simple example, we find in a melody. (Gestaltqualitaten may have one and only one instance.) We look indeed for analogies; but in the sort of case I have advanced, we take care lest the analogies confuse us, or blunt the precision of our understanding. Thus we call such action as that of Anthony Blunt treasonable; but in what precise sense is it so characterized? Are we simply bracketing it with, for instance, the activities of Jacobites north and south of the Border in the first half of the eighteenth century? Surely not; for the differences are enormous between the sort of treasonable activity in which Blunt engaged, and that to which adherents of the Old and Young Pretender committed themselves. Any account of Blunt's treason which sought to lay bare in what it consisted would have to determine what it was which differentiated its character from that of innumerable other instances of treasonable behaviour. Yet while such scrutiny would most certainly reveal at least a part of its uniqueness that uniqueness would not be such as to make it absolutely unique in the very special sense of its being impossible for us to conceive of its being repeated. And this obscure impossibility we tentatively suppose to be found in the coming of Christ in virtue of the fact that the Incarnation [Journal of Theological Studies, N.S., Vol. XXXIII, Pt. 1, April 1982]</page><page sequence="2">PROLEGOMENA TO CHRISTOLOGY 147 (if indeed the description has application) refers to that event in which the whole relation of temporal to eternal is rooted. If we speak then of the Incarnation as event, we are doing much more than claim for it the sort of qualitative uniqueness or singularity we may claim for Chamberlain's premiership or Blunt's treason. Yet we should not neglect the very serious attempts that have been made to render the problem of this uniqueness less intolerably difficult, its sheerly mysteri ous character more nearly perspicuous, by reducing or seeking to reduce the differences hitherto stressed. An argument developed (for instance) in Dr. Β. H. Streeter's essay Reality1 sought to present Jesus of Nazareth as the master of a characteristically religious approach to the world, as a supreme, even as the supreme, religious genius, occupying a place, fulfilling a role akin to that which we might assign in literature to William Shakespeare, or in music to Johann Sebastian Bach. The one be longs to 16th/17th-century England, the latter to 18th century-Germany. Neither is, in any sense, deracini: both are indebted for their formation to the world in which they grew up and lived. In an unpublished paper, written a few years before his death in 1945, on creativity and determinism, the late Professor A. E. Taylor remarked that although any knowledgeable contemporary observer might have predicted that sooner or later William Shakespeare would turn his hand to writing a revenge tragedy, even that he would draw on the Hamlet cycle, none would have successfully predicted (as an astronomer a transit of Venus) that he would make of the work the Hamlet we know. And this, even if our supposed student enjoyed the kind of privileged access to the writer's psyche, and capacity to read the signs present in his previous work, claimed by Dr. Ernest Jones in his strangely haunting Hamlet and and Oedipus.2 The originality of genius lies in the power to create what is instantly arresting, out of materials provided by inheritance, environment, personal experience. So (according to this view) in religion with Jesus of Nazareth. It should be emphasized that while Schleiermacher found the religious supremacy of Jesus to reside in the unique depth at which he realized that Abhangigkeitsgefiihl in which for him religion was essentially comprised, Streeter, as his work in the field of Christian origins attests, was by no means indifferent to the particularity of circumstance where the life of Christ was concerned. If he saw the story of Jesus' career as a Platonic myth (a myth, that is, after the manner of the myth of Gyges in Republic ii or that of Er in Republic Republic x) with the immense advantage of being a factual record, and not a brilliantly conceived imaginative projection of that which defied conceptual formulation by discursive human intelligence, that factuality Macmillan, 1927. 1 Gollancz, 1949.</page><page sequence="3">148 D. Μ. MACKINNON only fulfilled for us the conditions required of it, if much of its detail possessed historical verisimilitude. 'The shades of night are already gathering.' When the chef d'ceuvre of Streeter's work as a Neutesta mentler,mentler, The Four Gospels,1 was published, that Oxford tradition of 'source criticism' of which it was the definitive expression was already (unnoticed by its continuing practitioners) submitted to the radical critique implicit in the developing 'form-criticism' of the German schools. Yet however precarious in foundation or shallow in hermeneuti cal perception the 'Proto-Luke' or 'Four-Document' hypotheses may seem to be, we must credit the man who proposed them with a deep eagerness to restore the historical actuality of our picture of Jesus of Nazareth in order that its profoundly revelatory significance might be secured. But if it is uniqueness of this sort (viz. uniqueness as supreme master of a religious response to the world) that we find in Jesus, it is a uniqueness that is relative, not absolute. The claim that is made for his uniqueness in this respect is one that is defended by judgement of comparison with others finding their niche, as it were, on a graded scale. Here the reader is presented with a norm in the way in which a literary critic may offer him a canon after the manner of the late Dr. F. R. Leavis treating of the English novel, successively in The Great Tradition (1951), in D. H. Lawrence—Novelist (1955), and (with his wife) in Dickens Dickens the Novelist (1970), modifying, even to the point of retraction where Dickens is concerned, his judgement, but all the while enabling a paradigm to emerge by reference to which a great deal of other work may be evaluated, including of course the inferior products of the writers he thinks have contributed to the establishment of the great tradition. So analogously on this view with Jesus: 'author and perfecter' not merely of 'our faith', but by the creativity of his finished achieve ment the architect and the builder of a spiritual temple for all man kind. That the temple shall prove indeed a house of prayer for all nations it is for the Spirit, that 'other advocate' which the Father will send in his name, to secure. But in so far as the Spirit takes of the things that are of Jesus and discloses their inmost sense to his disciples, it is his role at once to perpetuate and to extend beyond the frontiers of natural anticipation the diverse richness of the Master's vision. Thus the creativity in Jesus is at once his personal work, and is enabled, as it were, as part of its invisible fruit, to transcend the temporal and geo graphical, the social, cultural, and historical frontiers of its first expression. This, although the exquisite and hard-wrought innocence, the mysterious and costing purity of its initial embodiment in him must remain as the Macmillan, 1924.</page><page sequence="4">PROLEGOMENA TO CHRISTOLOGY 149 'light of the world' come into the world 'not to judge the world, but that through him the world might be saved'; yet 'here is the judgement of this world: now is the Prince of this world cast out'. But is this uniqueness which we have sought to capture by extended analogy the uniqueness which according to traditional Christian theology, there has been in the Incarnation of the Word of God ? Is this the unique ness predicated of the event of his coming, the action of his life ? And the answer is surely no. One might begin by suggesting that we have to reckon here with a uniqueness of relation, which is a category of being. We move from a level in which we treat of achievement in a particular human domain, that of religion in contradistinction from that, for example, of the visual or plastic arts, to that of ontology, where the concepts which we employ, and on which we must reflect, are those of the highest pos sible level of generality, such that we say we encounter them in discourse concerning any subject-matter whatsoever; such concepts are thing and quality, existence, causality, relation, etc. What can we say of this allegedly unique relation, what of the terms that it relates? Is it a conceivable relation of relata, conceivable, even if it can be understood free of self-contradiction? It is often said that even if the definition of the Council of Chalcedon did not reveal 'the bankruptcy of patristic thought' (William Temple's phrase), in affirming this union of the incommensurables, it simply advertised work to be done, the setting of a question rather than the finding of a solution. Yet it was clearly affirmed that of this union, it is God who is the author: 'not by the conversion of the godhead into manhood, but by taking of the manhood into God.' He remains not simply the logical subject of this proposition: 'He was incarnate'; but ontologically he is the author of the act: in the sense of act in which this Incarnating may be spoken of as such. But what of this act ? It is the establishment of a new relation between humanity and God, one that is absolutely new. But what is humanity here ? Do we speak of that which is particular or of that which is universal ? Do we wish to say that God establishes a new relation to the human individual Jesus of Nazareth such as he has had with none other before or after ? Are we saying that his absolutely originating creativity is shown in a kind of baptism of this actual Jesus into relation with himself of an absolutely unprecedented sort? Or are we saying more? What does this verb establish establish mean here ? Does it presuppose two finished terms that are to be brought into relation one with another? Or is it claiming that where the humanum of Jesus is concerned, it is created as if demanding the divine as its suppositum, as if all the while finding itself for what it is in that relation: yet not so as to suggest that that to which it is related</page><page sequence="5">150 D. Μ. MACKINNON is itself a craving of this relation. And if it says the latter, what of that divine term ? Is it effected by being thus the suppositum, the ύποκείμΐνον, of of a humanum humanly complete; or is it in external relation as to that which is peripherally accidental to it? Even to treat the humanity of Jesus as the qualitas of the divine suppositum would be to come peri lously close to a monophysite view, diminishing the status of that which the Word assumes to a qualification of its unchangeable essence. Yet thus to plunge into ontological analysis is to risk substituting for the beckoning, questioning concreteness of the life of Jesus a 'ballet dance of impalpable abstractions', in whose sophisticated gyrations the most precious heart of the mystery is abandoned, or lost sight of. Therefore we do well to return to scrutinize the sense in which the Incarnation may be spoken of as an act. Continually in this discussion, familiar or relatively familiar terms are bent to novel employment. For the Incarnation, if we may characterize it as an act, is not an act in the sense in which Christ's preaching of non-resistance, his healings, his entry into Jerusalem, his dramatic intervention in the temple-courts are isolatable, locatable, datable, acts belonging to the same century as Tiberius' retirement to Capreae, the murder of Caligula, the conspiracy of Messalina against her husband, the sack of Jerusalem by Titus and its sequelae. For the act of the Incarnation is the provision, the positing, and the sustaining of the context within which the individual items of Christ's biography, whether known or irrevocably lost, fall. But what is the 'positing and sustaining of a context'? What indeed is a context in this connection ? Does the invocation of the notion here throw any greater light than that of suppositum? The phrase 'positing the context' suggests the provision of a setting, almost the over-all direction of a play, in which, as in many human biographies, there is a strange oscillation between that which is unexpected and almost random, and that which can be seen as contributing to an immanent design. Yet for the doctrine of the Incarnation, the context of the experiences is established through their being properly regarded as the experiences of the Son of God who is their subject. It is their ascription to the Eternal as the One whose experiences ultimately they are: this though they are also the experiences of the man Jesus of Nazareth, the experiences which go to render him what he is. When we speak of the experiences as at one and the same time the experiences of this man, this historical individual, and of the Eternal, what are we saying? How are we indeed in this question using the phrase 'at one and the same time' ? Yet it may be a little nearer, I will not say, the heart, but one depth of our problem: how can that which is necessarily realized in and through a particular point of time, namely a human life, belong to the eternal in such a</page><page sequence="6">PROLEGOMENA TO CHRISTOLOGY 151 bondage that we can without exaggeration speak of that life as being the very human life of the Eternal ? How can this Eternal have a human life, that which is immutably itself know the succession of a human career ? And the questions we advertise by the interrogative How ? are many and complex. One may say that the concept of the hypostatic union is invoked in the attempt humanly to answer the question: How shall these things be? Yet is it such an answer? Is it not rather a sharp affirmation of the problem created by the belief that they are so.? Yet even the possibly flimsy, one could say even tawdry image of stage direction and the vaguer, more dignified complement of authorship emphasizes that it is the Creator, the one through whom all things came into being, who is uniquely at work here: that in the Incarnation, God draws near to men. So in crudely mythological idiom, it suggests not only an event in time but a movement in space. In the so-called 'Nicene Creed' the daunting obscurity of the homoousion is followed by statement that is even more dauntingly mythological, suggestive indeed of the deus ex machina,machina, resonant with the theological emphasis so eloquently trounced by the late Professor C. E. Raven, which treats the created universe as no more than the stage-set for the drama of redemption: 'Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven.'1 Maybe we did not need to wait for Rudolf Bultmann to point the brash, vulgar crudity of the images, or to remind us that such confession is only unforced on the lips of men and women living in a pre-Copernican world. Yet is not such language indispensable in that without it the underlying convic tion which arguably the Chalcedonian definition seeks clumsily enough to demythologize would go unformulated ? In the order of the 'Nicene' confession the homoousion precedes the lapse into mythological idiom: the category of substance is invoked to insist that the faith of Trinity and of Incarnation is monotheistic. There indeed lies the deepest prob lematic of the former even as it safeguards the latter from degradation into cult of demigod or hero. The conception of the hypostatic union lies, as it were, the other side both of primary ontological and of mytho logically formulated confession. It seeks indeed to 'demythologize' the latter: this though claiming enough at first sight for it to seem to swing giddily between subordinating faith to dexterity in the specialist world of abstract ontology (compare Dr. P. T. Forsyth's use of the term 'Chalcedonism' as a pejorative) and offering as an exposition mysterii verhiverhi incarnati what to schematizing imagination must seem a gimcrack construction: and this as an account of the one who bids men and women come to him to find rest for their souls, who taught and healed, who There is no suggestion here of the distinctive character of Platonic myth.</page><page sequence="7">152 D. Μ. MACKINNON prayed and suffered. Yet we have perhaps implied enough that such imaginative schematization is an indulgence, and that the subtlety of ontological exploration is forfeit by such wilfulness. Moreover as the order of the statement in the 'Nicene' confession may have suggested, such explanation is not intended to absorb, and render superfluous, the more haunting and appealing idiom of myth, but to complement and discipline it. By our question the Chalcedonian formula assumes a conception of divine transcendence, of what in conscious rejection of a seemingly attractive metaphysical immanentism, S0ren Kierkegaard called 'the infinite qualitative difference between God and man'. Yet as Kierkegaard himself emphasized, in many places (never more force fully perhaps than in the work that should be known as 'Training into Christianity'), this transcendent, even if to entertain the possibility of its change was to entertain a self-contradiction, has been bound, or rather has bound itself in inseparable union with the manhood of Jesus of Nazareth. 'Behold the great creator makes himself a house of clay: a robe of virgin flesh he takes, which he will wear for aye'. Or again in the words of Ambrose: '0 equal of the Father Thou, Thy fleshly mantle gird on now.' The metaphors are hackneyed enough, and one is right quickly to point out that a man or woman may lay that coat, that scarf, that mantle aside when they come indoors from the cold. The carol carefully insists that the robe of human flesh (and here flesh must be understood as flesh and blood: human nature) is taken 'for aye', emphatically not to be dis carded as one suit of clothes may be laid aside and replaced by another. Yet in it too the image is invoked to bring out the sheer externality of relation between godhead and manhood. If the latter only exists in the former (whatever precisely 'in' may there indicate), there is no infusion (a misleading word, but employed to suggest) of godhead into manhood: no effective communication of the very substance (deutera ousia) of former to latter. The communicatio idiomatum is construed as hardly more than a licence to carry out certain linguistic substitutions in speaking, for instance, of Jesus' weariness, and God's power in him. So by arbitrary, supposedly divine permission it may speak of God as weary and the dying Jesus as omnipotent: 'Quaerens me sedisti lassus; Redemisti crucem passus'. But the exhaustion was the Nazarene's, the agonized endurance his: yet because of this mystery of union, it can kindle our devotion by speaking of them as God's own. Hardly more than a linguistic licence? Yes: a little more, for the arbitrariness of the conven tional permission is grounded in incommensurable fact. One might perhaps say that as well as permissible, notional indulgence it is proper acclamation. But what is being acclaimed ?</page><page sequence="8">PROLEGOMENA TO CHRISTOLOGY 153 Yet an effort was made (as was noticed above) to present the manhood of the concrete identifiable man, Jesus of Nazareth, as radically affected by its assumption by the Eternal. So it is insisted that he becomes not a a man, but manhood. God the Son is the ultimate subject of the act of assumption, and manhood assumed by God forfeits, through that assumption, its identifiable particularity: this though, of course, it is never intended that Jesus of Nazareth ceases to be distinguishable as an individual from his contemporaries. 'Whom seek ye?' 'Jesus of Naza reth.' Rather what is intended is that that altogether unique relation to the Eternal that we name hypostatic union is malgre tout internal to the term assumed in such a way that it is constituted by an openness to the divine so uniquely thoroughgoing (I had almost said absolutely) that it is rendered in itself impersonal. Any corresponding reciprocity between godhead and manhood is denied as ultimately imperilling the sovereign freedom of the Divine, expressed in the redemption of the human race, and its very changelessness. So we seem to have moved back as it were in a cricle, to the previous point of concentration on the act of assumption: this seemingly impene trable mystery constitutive of the Incarnate Word. Of course the modern student is and must be appalled by the subordination of the searching simplicities of the synoptic Gospels, even their peculiar strangeness, to this obsessive preoccupation with twisted ontological categories. We are all Antiochenes rather than Alexandrines now: and to many it must seem as if the approach of this study deprives it instantly of claim to serious attention in that for the most part it seems to proceed 'from above downwards' and not 'from below upwards'. Disputes concerning theo logical method are, however, often tedious and time-wasting: there is a very great deal to be said for the maxim: 'Tackle the problem and the methodological principles will take care of themselves.' But at this point it is perhaps permissible, possibly even necessary, to insert a reference to this frequently parroted antithesis. Of course the language in which the opposition is expressed is meta phorical: 'from below upwards': 'from above downwards'. What we are concerned with is God and man. Do we in positing the Incarnation move from God to man or from man to God? To some the answer might be thought obvious in as much as we are men and women. Yet is it quite like this? For Christ comes before us, or at least it is possible that he is in fact so presented, as one who violates the contrast, or in old fashioned evangelical language, bridges or straddles the gulf between human and divine: and this he does not by arrogance of assertive claim, but by a strange, haunting alternation, even interpenetration of humility and authority, receptivity and confident demand. So in a profoundly</page><page sequence="9">154 D· M- MACKINNON suggestive phrase, the late Dr. W. R. Inge spoke of 'an infinite self abnegation' as the characteristic hallmark of the fourth Evangelist's por trait of the Son of God. If we are interrogated by Christ across the centuries: 'Who do you say that I am?', in our answer it is our concep tions at once of the actuality of divine existence and of the possibilities of human that are brought to the bar of a questioning more devastating, more searching, and (must we not say ?) more intellectually demanding than the Socratic. We are made to be drawn in all directions at once, and where the emphasis of this study is concerned, to engage at once with time and eternity, with temporal and eternal. Certainly to write in these terms is to commit oneself to a particular view or to one of a number of particular views concerning the New Testament documents, in particular concerning the status of the por traits of the central figure. One need not claim for these portraits (and the use of the plural is deliberate) the verisimilitude of a set of Identi kit pictures or passport photographs, or indeed the kind of accuracy found, for instance, in John Grigg's major biography of Lloyd George or for that matter claim for them as much as may be claimed for Plutarch's lives of Pericles and Pompey, Aristides and Brutus. One should not attempt to iron out the inconsistencies, but rather to see their presence as an invitation to more searching enquiry: finding in that presence evidence that the reality of Jesus defied any sort of easy, and indeed most sorts of comparatively painful, assimilation. This strange ness may be judged rooted in, and expressive of, the way in which he lives uniquely as the frontier of the familiar and the transcendent, the relative and the absolute, and by so standing, demands that our every conception of both alike be revised. Where the traditional theologies of the Incarnation may be thought to have gone astray lies in a surrender to an uncriticized, even deeply mistaken conception of divine transcendence. One might say that while their grasp of the unique denotation of the term 'transcen dent' was obstinately correct, their refusal to allow its uniqueness of reference to be queried, or the incommensurability of divine and human to be challenged absolutely justified, yet there was a failure to allow that divine sovereignty might contain within itself the foundation of divine self-limitation. Or more precisely there was a failure to ask how far the Trinitarian conception of God as he is in himself (the doctrine of an essential as distinct from an economic Trinity) compelled transformation of the understanding of transcendence ? The connotation of the term 'transcendent' was found too easily in terms of an absolutely immutable self-sufficiency, an invulnerable aseity, formally defensible but certainly demanding reconstruction in the light</page><page sequence="10">PROLEGOMENA TO CHRISTOLOGY 155 of Christian reality. The mistake involved is insisting that while the world is related to God in a dependence to which that of a song or the singer who is singing it is a remote, but not wholly ineffective analogy, to speak of him as related to the world in any other than a purely notional sense is a radical mistake. It is a mistake because while seek ing to safeguard what may be characterized mythologically as divine immunity from involvement in the affairs of the world, securing an infinite, unaffected resourcefulness in creative design, it achieves such a safeguard only at the cost of rendering the exercise of such resource virtually self-contradictory. It is as if to secure the possibility of the radically self-initiated, one rendered impossible its execution. And it is in the actuality as distinct from any sort of abstract possibility of such execution that the point de depart of Christian confession is found: that is in Jesus of Nazareth in whom the incommensurables of God and man are found united, or in whom, and by whom the problem of the 'flow' of their union is raised by the daunting dizzying presence of its reality. What light can be thrown on our central problem if it engages more closely now with the theme of temporal and eternal, with the manner of their relation in Jesus ? And here a word of warning lest such procedure seem to be a necessarily futile quasi-biographical essay seeking to trace the 'development of Christ's messianic consciousness'. While nothing is gained by the attempt to reconstruct empathetically the supposed gradually maturing self-identification of Jesus with the deutero-Isaianic 'servant', it is equally a mistake to avert attention from the deeply significant spatial and temporal armature of the Gospel narrative. The importance in the synoptic presentation of the movement from Galilee to Jerusalem is familiar enough; but equally significant is the continued reference to an hour that is not yet come to one known only to the Father, to one that might pass, to one that is come. There is a time as well as a place for the death of a prophet. Further, in the Fourth Gospel this movement from one place to another, this waiting for that which is not yet come, and acclaiming the same when it is come, is set in the context of a mission from the Father into the world and to the Father: a mission that contains within its design its initiation, its execu tion, and its end, its settings, its occasions, and its final issue. The word mission is, as we shall see, of crucial imprtance. It is not only, as Professor Christopher Evans has pointed out, that ho pempsas me Pater Pater is for the fourth evangelist a deeply pregnant designation of God himself; it is also as Hans Urs von Balthasar has profoundly argued in Theodramatik1 ii. 2) that mission is a christological category of very Einsiedeln, 1978.</page><page sequence="11">156 D. Μ. MACKINNON powerful import inasmuch as the missiones ad extra personarum unius individuaeindividuae Trinitatis are grounded in and expressions of the processional interior life of God. There is suggested by the New Testament documents, and in parti cular the Fourth Gospel an ontology of the relations of eternity to time, constructed or reconstructed in the light of the focusing of those relations in Jesus. It may be that one of the most important intellectual shifts accomplished in New Testament theology is the movement from an eschatology on occasion flamboyantly apocalyptic in its imagery to a Christological concentration, always theocentric, but insisting that some of the riddles tradition had bequeathed as unsolved problems should be translated into terms of relationships realized in a human career, lying indeed at its very foundation. Where the Gospels pass from the quasi-biographical to the overtly theological is the place at which this issue is allowed to arise, and not only to arise, but to focus an always questioning faith in the figure of a man: as if here is the point at which faith must seek to mature itself by the effort of understanding. The problem of Christology arises most acutely when it occurs almost as the inhumanization of the issue of the relation of the temporal to the eternal, the transformation of that issue into the one of the ontological structure of Christ's person, the inter penetration of these incommensurables in the unfathomably mysterious texture of his being: at once God and man. But if faith must seek understanding in its quest it joins understanding seeking faith. A proper theology must always allow the point of junction to be crucial. Furthermore it has been indicated that the doctrine of the Incarnation assumes a doctrine of creation. The use of the indefinite article, not the but a doctrine of creation, is quite intentional; for if formally the thesis that God is creator of all things visible and invisible remains identical across the centuries, it would be obscurantist folly to ignore as of only secondary significance our enlarged understanding both of the scale and detail of the creative process. Yet this understanding which we are right to recognize as something to be won rather than as assured possession is assumed in the elaboration of the doctrine of the Incarnation. For the One of whom we predicate Incarnation is the One through whom the foundations of the universe have been laid and sustained, and it is through insisting that in Jesus of Nazareth he is uniquely present that we attribute (in a synthetic proposition) divinity to him. But what of the message of his presence ? Enough has been said to show how important for enlarging our insight into the meaning of this presence is sensitivity to the range of issues comprised under the rubric—the relation of time to eternity. And time, whether or not we</page><page sequence="12">PROLEGOMENA TO CHRISTOLOGY 157 agree with Augustine in his insistence that time came into being with creation, is the most pervasive structural form of the world as we know it. If however we allow the mystery of the Incarnation to shed its light upon the formal order of relations of creature to creator, and creator to creature, and if we give to that mystery the authority it claims, we must reverse any understanding of divine transcendence that sees transcendence as only safeguarded by refusal to admit any sort of self-limitation into the divine, any sort of self-committal in creation that would allow a genuine, if assymmetrical, reciprocity in relations of creation and creator. Of course God must (and the must is of logical necessity) remain invulnerable. One might say that his aseity can be mythologized in terms of an ultimate invulnerability. Such idioms of course allow the indulgence of representing God as in time; for it is through time that what is at risk is procured. 'And thou continuest holy, Ο thou worship of Israel' (Ps. 22).1 Yet if it is an invulnerability that is acclaimed here, it is not one of indifference: but urged with a thrust that is of love as well as of dignity. But it must not suggest a conflict, as if there were temptation as most certainly was met by Jesus. The threat to the being of the Incarnate which is suggested by the tradition of the forty days' ordeal in the desert (recapitulation of the experience of the children of Israel, but very much more than that) is as it were projection, a resonance in time and space, of that which in fact is the unfathomable actuality of his presence to, and not just over against, the world he has brought into being, is sustaining, is bringing to fulfilment. In human terms such presence is affirmed in terms of a victory over sceptical despair: but in se, what is it—this presence of the threefold God to his world? If we must excise from the concept we form of it any hint of conflict, of struggle, even of the peace that is achieved through such engagement, how are we to convey to ourselves that energy, that unceasingly urgent concern which belongs of necessity to its actuality ? Again we must plunge into abstraction: but what sort of abstraction? Surely a very special sort that seeks to capture in its elemental purity the texture of the divine creative presence. There is another question that must however be advanced here, and that is the involvement of God in his threefold being in the Incarnation. We shall find it possible to suggest in a pioneering essay in utterance of unutterable that the very unity of the threefold God is as it were put at risk in the Incarnation, in Jesus' total dependence on faith and prayer in his temptation. (The point may be illustrated by the initial Western misgivings over the formula 'one of the Trinity became incarnate, 1 Ps. 224.—B.C.P. version.</page><page sequence="13">158 D. Μ. MACKINNON proposed by the Scythian monks at Rome in 519, and successfully advocated by implication in Boethius' opuscula.) Ό wisest love! that flesh and blood, which did in Adam fail, should strive afresh against their foe, should strive and should prevail.' 'And that a higher gift than grace, should flesh and blood refine: God's presence and his very self and essence all divine.' And this refinement is won through that 'very self and essence all divine' putting itself (in essentia unitas, in per sonissonis proprietas, in maiestate aequalitas) at risk through demanding its affirmation, its sustained defence, in conditions of human ordeal. Can we speak in sense reaching beyond nominal communicatio idiomatum of a divine ordeal ? If we do so it is in the setting of the hypostatic union as it were, bringing to unforeseeable, spontaneous completion in un imaginable fullness of self-communication that to which in principle at least a tentative commitment has been made in creation, is indeed made all the while. One can by no logical sleight of hand conjure the ul timate intimacy of divine self-exposure out of the relation of creator to creation. Yet creation provides the parables through which use can represent to ourselves the impending mystery. Again: a word on method. The heart of the problem facing anyone who essays a treatise de verbo Incarnato is the oscillation, the alternation of language that is abstractly ontological with language that is mytho logical, crudely anthropomorphic. In part the former provides the means of disciplining the latter, or rendering its use aseptic, proof against the corruption of the imagination. But there is more to it than that: for the anthropomorphic is as it were penetrated by the ontological styles, bent and twisted till the very concept of God as he is in himself is suffused by its emphases. It is as if a new piety was born, a piety that imagination can find in the Gospels. But it is with time and eternity that we are first and foremost concerned, and it is to this relation that we must now turn: to time and eternity, but also to space and omni presence. 'Of that hour knoweth no man, not the angels in heaven nor the Son but the Father only.' This logion is a clear statement that for the Son in his Incarnate existence, as the one whose very being consists in his-being-sent, the ultimate secrets are to be received: not immediately transparent, but painfully won. There is no transcendence of the per vasive temporal, no leaping over its condition. What constitutes such limitation in arcards aeternae deitatis we cannot know: receptivity as a moment in absolute being is something to be affirmed as mystery. But it is the ground of that which we encounter in the temporal experience of Jesus. And his experience is most certainly temporal in form. 'Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and</page><page sequence="14">PROLEGOMENA TO CHRISTOLOGY 159 man.' It is at the age of 12 that he is taken by his parents to Jerusalem for Passover, when he reminds them that on this very advance into maturity, he must be about his Father's affairs in his Father's house, that temple which is so crucial a locale in the Lucan writings. Time, place, movement: these pervasive forms of human experience are the forms of the experience of Jesus. Even if we must agree that the order of Jesus' history, as we have received it, is imposed on the events that make it up by the evangelists, so that in fact we cannot confidently speak of the order in which the events happened (and I am not thinking simply of the differences between Synoptic and Johannine schematiza tions), yet still the writers are concerned with what is in itself a temporal series in which there was an actual before and after. And this before and after was something received, and something fashioned out of what was received. There was, for instance, a 'not yet'; 'my hour is not yet come'. Yet that hour was not something passively awaited: 'Sleep on now, and take your rest: the hour is come: the Son of Man is betrayed.' It is not mere catastrophe, but an action that Jesus goes forth to meet. And this because it is his Father's will, and the hour something he receives from the Father's hand. The delicacy of interplay is discernible across the construction of the writers who are responding to the tern porality of Jesus' experience by the shape of their representation. So their memories (and I should try to clarify my use of the term here) constitute essays in the recapture of his self-consciousness as that was fashioned through response to the world ordered by him, as that world impinged on him. An old-fashioned exegesis sought to trace 'the develop ment of the Messianic consciousness' of Jesus, treating, for instance, his baptism in the Jordan as a crucial episode in the advance of his self-identification with the Christ. But to limit his self-identification to such a moment is to ignore the extent to which it was achieved through a multitude of relations, through receptivity and response. There is a sense in which the value he gives to the variable 'There is an x, such that I am χ and no one is χ who is not identified with myself' remains open; it is always for his Father to assign that value, and its assignation is clearly bound up with the identification of his hour. What is his hour ? What the hour of the Son of Man ? What that of the power of darkness ? And this hour is crucial in a human life; how is it related to the eternal ? And how both alike to the raising of the Son from the dead? That has a date; it has its before and after. Yet it is also the eternization of the life of the Son; this in the sense of giving it a universal contem poraneity, but not in such a way that nothing happened in the raising which was not in itself unique, and which is reflected in that which is contemporaneous. F</page><page sequence="15">160 D. J. MACKINNON *Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more: death has no more dominion over him.' We may indeed by an effort of imaginative abstraction force ourselves to attend to the detailed particularity of the In carnate life, deliberately stripping what we imagine to ourselves bare of is the least hint of the perceptibly numinous; indeed such representation necessary to convey to ourselves the thrust of the kenosis. But what is contemporary is that which through his Father's act in raising him Christ has become. What does it imply for our understanding of time that in time there has been accomplished not simply the eternization of a particular biography but the constitution of that biography as the way for the insertion of all human circumstance into the tapestry of the eternal? And how is this insertion related to the presence of the eternal in the details of that history, to the return of the eternal so present, to the role of that eternal in the constitution of the time-order ?
