<plain_text><page sequence="1">Putting a Ceiling on Sealing: Conservation and Cooperation in the International Arena, 1909-1911 Kurk Dorsey Yale University The biosphere presents unique challenges to the world's diplomats. Trained to operate in the realm of military might and economic influence, these women and men are now faced with an array of environmental issues which defy traditional diplomatic solutions. Natural resources, flora and fauna, and pollution rarely conform themselves to national boundaries; thus, environmental issues take on an international context. In many of these cases, the old methods of unilateral action and conflict will lead to more environmental damage. A new system, which stresses cooperation, must arise in order to solve international environmental issues. Fortunately, history provides an example of successful cooperation in handling a complex international environmental issue. As early as 1911, in the heart of the Great Power era, four nations came together to resolve a dispute over the North Pacific fur seal. Forsaking threats to wipe out the seals, the negotiators adopted the American conservationist doctrine of efficient exploitation of natural resources, which required cooperation, not conflict.' The fur seal issue was particularly complex. The seals wandered among several islands and across the North Pacific, crossing through international waters and several nations' territory. Hunters from</page><page sequence="2">28 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW FALL Canada, Japan, the United States and Russia pursued these animals at different times and in different places. With no international control, the sealers slaughtered the seals as fast as they could. As Arthur McEvoy has shown, in a system with no rewards for forbearance, the harvesters will quickly exhaust the natural resource in question.' In the face of the imminent extinction of the fur seal, diplomats from the sealing nations and American conservationists struggled to find a solution to save the sealing industry and the species on which it depended. From the American standpoint, there were three stages in the resolution of theproblem. First, in 1909-l0anumberoftrendsconverged which forced a re-examination of American policy towards the seal, and natural resources in general. Second, in 1911, the United States, Russia, Japan and Great Britain (for Canada) negotiated the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention, which outlawed pelagic sealing. In these discussions, the question of proprietary rights was the main sticking point, as the pelagic sealing nations had a different concept of seal ownership than the land sealing nations did. Third, in 1912, conservationists divided in the battle over the inclusion of a closed season in the enabling legislation for the treaty. At all three stages, the conservationists pushed for a maximization of efficiency, through the elimination of waste, which, for the first time, they tried to apply to an international resource. The focus of this attention was the Northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), a furry, squid-eatingmammal at the top of the food chain in the Bering Sea. Samuel Flagg Bemis provided the best summary of the seal's existence: "Amphibious is the fur seal, ubiquitous and carivorous, uniparous, gregarious and withal polygamous."2 Throughout the nineteenth century, people hunted seals for use in the fashion industry worldwide, without stopping to consider the impact on the animal itself. By 1909, scientists had a pretty good idea of the seal lifestyle, such as it was. Despite this knowledge, the history of human interaction with the seal, from the seal's perspective, bordered on the disastrous. The seal had three main breeding populations in the North Pacific, and scientistsbelieved that the three groups did not intermingle much. The largest herd, containing as many as four million animals, bred on the American-owned Pribilof Islands, which were uninhabited rocks until the sealers arrived. The second largest herd lived on Russian-owned Commander Island. The third herd, which contained only a few thousand seals, lived on the Japanese-owned Kurile Islands. Since 1910, scientists have determined that the herds do intermix enough that they are all from the same species.3</page><page sequence="3">1991 KURK DORSEY 29 Although the rookeries were on these islands, the animals spent far more time in the water, as one look at them would indicate. Those seals that "hauled out" onto the islands in the summer stayed for three weeks to four months at the most. During the rest of the year, the seals followed a 2000 mile elliptical path through the Northern Pacific, returning to their island rookeries anywhere from April to August. Even during their stay on the islands, the seals spent most of their time foraging well outside the three mile territorial water limit. Thus, every seal wasborn on a nation's territory, but then spent about three quarters of its life in international waters.4 Ownership of such a resource did not fit under any of the old models. The salvation of the seals required that the sealing nations adopt a new system of international cooperation. The seal's habit of polygamy created conditions that facilitated the harvesting of male seals. Bulls rarely mate before age ten, and few females become pregnant before eight years. Breeding males gather harems as large as 100 females, although the normal size is more like thirty. Because the ratios are so steep, few males ever get to breed. Under such an evolutionary strategy, the males engage in fierce fights to gain females for the harem. The younger bachelor males, who come to the islands later in the summer, tend to stay clearof these hormonally active behemoths for their own safety.5 With so few males necessary for breeding purposes, early sealers decided that the pods of youngbachelor males were not vital to the survival of the species; they could harvest these seals with impunity. A thick fur coat protected the seal from the elements of the Northern Pacific, but also made the animals a target for intense economic exploitation. With a density of 300,000 hairs per square inch, the seal's fur provided excellent insulation against chilly waters. To the fashion industry of the Western world, seal skins made excellent coats. When beaver and sea-otters became scarce, seal fur filled the void.' The very qualities which made the fur perfect for the Bering Sea made it desirable on Fifth Avenue. The Pribilof Island seals did quite well until discovered by the Russians around 1800. Awed by the immeasurable size of the herds, the Russians began unrestricted hunting of the seals. Not surprisingly, the population crashed, forcing them to reconsider their methods. A roller- coaster ride followed, as the Russians tried to discover the mysteries of the seal's biology. The Czar's sealers provided a valuable historical lesson to the Americans who would later take over the management of the Pribilof herd.7 When the United States purchased Alaska in 1867 for $7.2 million, italso picked upapproximatelytwomillion furseals. Congress</page><page sequence="4">30 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW FALL granted the Treasury Department control of the islands on the condition that it lease out exclusive rights to club seals to a private firm. By 1870, the Alaska Commercial Company had signed a 20 year lease with the government to kill seals, under government regulation. The company agreed to take only non-breeding males and limit the take to 100,000 annually. In return, they paid the government a royalty on each skin taken, plus an annual rent of $55,000. The deal made money for both sides, but the rise of pelagic sealing made the quota of 100,000 skins unrealistic.8 By 1890, the seal population was in trouble again, and federal officials recognized that they needed to alter the terms for the new lease. The first step was to lower the number of skins taken to 60,000, although the government reserved the right to change that number at any time. In addition, the lessee had to pay a much higher royalty per skin to the Treasury. The newly-formed North American Commercial Company used its close ties to the Harrison Administration to win the new lease.9 Despite these changes, the govenmment found itself losing money on the seals; the increased pelagic sealing necessitated an expensive commitment from the Revenue Cutter Service.10 The new lease failed to deal with the issue of pelagic sealing, which had begun in earnest in 1882. While commercial sealers had operated on the high seas for at least a decade, in that year they took 20,000 skins for the first time. The pelagic harvest reached its peak in 1893 when 121,000 skins taken in this manner were sold in London. The CanadiansandJapanese,asnationswithoutviablesealherds,constituted the bulk of the sealing fleet. The American and Russian governments had prohibited their ship-owners from joining the sealing fleet because each had already granted exclusive rights to individual companies. In the early 1890s, Great Britain and the United States attempted to deal with the pelagic sealing issue in the traditional, confrontational manner of diplomacy. Treasury agents on the Pribilofs estimated that the seal herd was only 20% of its size in 1870,11 sparking an international debate about the cause of the decline. Both nations threatened to use force to resolve the crisis. Unable to work out a solution, the two nations eventually sought international arbitration. After several seizures of Canadian sealing vessels in international waters around the Pribilofs in 1889, tensions between Great Britain and the United States mounted. As American revenue cutters prepared to sail for Alaska in 1890, the Royal Navy leaked plans to dispatch four armored cruisers to the Bering Sea to protect Canadian sealers. While naval strategists contemplated war, Secretary of State James Blaine relaxed his position, keeping the cutters in Seattle. Although</page><page sequence="5">1991 KURK DORSEY 31 avoiding armed conflict, the Americans were not prepared to accept pelagic sealing. In order to appease seal experts and entrap the British diplomatically, Blaine proposed a one year, renewable mod us vivendi in 1890. The terms were quite simple. Both nations would agree to enforce a ban on pelagic sealing, limit land sealing to 7500 taken, and establish a joint scientific commission to investigate the cause of the seal's decline. IgnoringCanadian domestic pressure, British ForeignSecretary Lord Salisbury accepted the deal.12 From the modus vivendi came one of the first serious scientific investigations of the fur seal. The joint commission issued a three page statement declaring that fur seals were in decline, then it disbanded, unable to agree on anything else. The American delegates, C. Hart Merriam and Thomas C. Mendenhall, both respected government scientists, filed their own report in April, 1892. Together, they demonstrated how the seal's population depended on a secure birth rate. They concluded that "the deterioration of the herd must be attributed to the destruction of female seals." Given thestrict regulations against killing females on the Pribilofs, the two scientists recommended a complete ban on pelagic sealing as the only measure which could save theherds.13 The British, however, acknowledged none of these problems and threatened to terminate the modus vivendi. Confident in the scientific accuracy of their beliefs, the United States took Great Britain to arbitration at the Paris Tribunal of 1893. The Americans argued that they had purchased both the islands and half of the Bering Sea from the Russians in 1867; therefore, they had jurisdiction over the sealing activities there. In addition, they argued that the seals were domestic animals which strayed outside of their domain. Based on Merriam's and Mendenhall's report, the Americans claimed that 'pelagic sealing is an illegitimate, improper, and wasteful method of killing, is barbarous and inhuman...it is wholly destructive of the seal property and of the...commerce founded upon it." The British argued that the three mile territorial limit should apply to the Pribilofs, just as it did to any other islands. Turning the tables on the Americans, they also produced a report by Henry Elliott, an American, who charged that the land sealingwashighly destructive. The Americans lost their case, but the tribunal did establish a 60 mile buffer zone around the islands which the Canadians could not enter.'4 While high seas sealing presented obvious benefits to Japan and Canada, in the long-run, it was a disaster for the economic value of the seal herds. With a ship, sealers could follow the animals year-round on their migration route. While on the open ocean, the sealers were free</page><page sequence="6">32 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW FALL of regulation and shot what they pleased. They did the greatest damage, though, while anchored just off the seal rookeries. Any female shot also eliminated both the pup in the rookery, the pup in the womb, and pups yet to be conceived.'5 Pelagic sealing inflicted maximum damage at minimum cost. Conservationists opposed pelagic sealing for two reasons. First, it seemed unnecessarily cruel. In the water, the sealers could not tell the difference between a male and female, so they ended up shootingmany female seals. Theconservationistsportrayed the ensuing starvation of orphaned pups, which would not be adopted by other seals, as inhuman and barbaric.'6 Second, pelagic sealing meant extraordinary waste. Between fifty and eighty per cent of all seals shot at sea sank withoutbeing recovered. Inother words, between two and ten seals died for each skin taken at sea. The alternative to pelagic sealing-land sealing-represented efficiency and was compatible with the long-term stability of the herd. In theory, the sealing on the Pribilofs was carefully regulated. The immutable principle was that no one could kill female seals. The sealers were to herd the bachelors to particular areas, confirm that they were male, then cluband skin them.'8 Whileperhapscold-hearted, this method provided a means to both harvest the seals and preserve the species. In natural resource management terms, thismethod allowed for maximum sustainable yield. To most American conservationists, the major difference between land and pelagic sealing came down to efficiency versus inefficiency. In Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency, Samuel Hays argued that conservationists during this time period, as part of the Progressive movement, pursued the efficient use of natural resources. The decision-makers relied on experts, such as the Fur Seal Advisory Board, whose members had many years of experience in such issues. The enormous wastage evident in American society appalled the conservationists, who hoped to apply science to resource management. They were often politically connected, scientifically trained men; therefore, "the political implications of conservation....grew out of the political implications of applied science."'9 To these early conservationists, pelagic sealing epitomized the worst of environmental abuses, while regulated land killing portrayed Progressive concepts of resource use. Where pelagic sealing was individualistic and unregulated, land killing used an advisory board of biologists to set the rules. Pelagic sealers shot anything, while land sealers took only males in a particular age range. Most important, pelagic sealing involved the waste of a resource, while land sealing</page><page sequence="7">1991 KURK DORSEY 33 insured that few skins would be wasted. To the conservationists, pelagic sealing had to be stopped. The Progressive movement was just one of a series of trends which brought the seal issue to the fore of the domestic political scene in 1909. The administration of William Howard Taft brought in new people, particularly Charles Nagel, the new Secretary of Commerce and Labor, who seemed willing to accept outside opinion. At the same time, the conservationist movement shifted its focus from inanimate resources to wildlife resources. Finally, the imminent expiration of the NACC lease forced all concerned to consider terms fora new lease. The convergence of these factors was fortuitous; the fur seal had come within a hair of extinction. One must be careful when discussing the seal population, because exact numbers were difficult to come by. Earlyestimates set the total at four million around 1870, but one government report warned that those estimates were untrustworthy. Even in 1910, with goverrnent agents on the scene, the Department of Commerce and Labor could only guess that the Pribilof herd numbered 130,000. The first step of the modern ecologist, inventory assessment, was still an inexact science in 1910.20 Even so, there could have been no doubt that the seal population had crashed to near extinction. Meanwhile, the conservationists were in transition between Hays' portrayal of the movement, and that recently described by Stephen Fox. In his book, John Muir and His Legacy, Fox argues that in the 1910s, conservationists shifted froma concern with "land, trees and water" to a concern with wildlife. Fox would agree with Hays that conservation started out as an attempt to rationalize the use of natural resources, but he argues that the movement took a sharp turn towards the preservation of wildlife for its own sake. Conservationists did not speak of this shift, but it is evident in their actions that they were turning their sights from forests and rivers to the things that lived in them.21 The seals provided a bridge between the two views of conservation. On one hand, the common goal of all involved on the American side was to preserve the maximum sustainable yield22 Seals were a resource to be exploited, not romanticized. On the other hand, in his most impassioned rhetoric, eccentric conservationist William T. Hornaday appealed to save "the harried herds." The New York Times referred to "the people [pelagic sealers] who enjoy killing mothers so that their litter may starve to death," and who were out to "assassinate" mother seals23 Such rhetoric simply did not apply to rocks or rivers and carried with it strong emotional overtones. Seals represented both an economic opportunityand the need to protect wildlife. To work around</page><page sequence="8">34 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW FALL this contradiction, conservationists felt that seals should be killed in a humane and orderly fashion. Conservationists wereby no means united on the seal issue. As Hays and Fox have pointed out, the movement often split into two camps over issues of wildlife protection. The most numerous and well- connected, the establishment conservationists, followed the Progressive line very closely. On this particular issue, they were led by Dr. David Starr Jordan, a renowned icthyologist and President of Stanford University. Jordan chaired the Fur Seal Advisory Board, composed of biologists and seal experts. Jordan and his allies received the support of men like George Bird Grinnell, editor of Field and Stream.24 Theestablishmentwingbelieved verystrongly thatseals should be harvested as a valuable economic resource. Based on their studies, they sent a complete setof recommendations to SecretaryNagel in 1909. First, they suggested that the government should take complete control of the sealing operations on the Pribilofs. The imminent expiration of the NACC lease would provide the opportunity for such a move. Second, they "recommended that there be arranged a conference of scientific men and diplomats of Great Britain, Canada, Japan, Russia and the United States, for consideration of the question of pelagic sealing." The United States, the committee said, should take any necessary steps to end pelagic sealing.25 While Nagel had accepted these reasonable proposals, the small, but raucous, outsider branch of the conservation movement felt that Nagel had not gone far enough. Composed mainly of self- appointed seal expert Henry Elliott and verbal hit-man William Hornaday, this small group hounded Nagel for four years in an effort to convert him or beat him senseless. The New York Times assisted them ably in this quest by quoting Hornaday at length in its editorials on the sealing issue. Hornaday's letters bulged with upper-case paragraphs, underlined sentences, and outrageous, occasionally true, accusations about government seal experts and conservationists alike.26 His rhetoric made great copy and excellent publicity. William Temple Hornaday wanted to be the leader of the wildlife preservation movement. His outspoken manner and short temper earned him quite a few enemies throughout the conservationist movement. He was bom in the midwest in 1854, but traveled throughout the world as a young man, sending back mounted animal specimens, which he had shot, to natural history museums. In 1896, he joined the Brooklyn Zoo, which he used as a platform for his new-found anti- hunting beliefs. In 1909, he decided to become involved in the seal dispute, because he felt that he was "friendly to all parties concerned."</page><page sequence="9">1991 KURK DORSEY 35 He referred to his participation in "the fight that saved the fur seal industry," indicating that he deemed the industry more important than the animal. Hornaday wanted the seal protected in the short run, but he also wanted regulated, efficient sealing once the species had regained its former numbers.27 Henry Wood Elliott was Hornaday's "advisor" and the first to sound the alarm about the Northern fur seal. Born in 1846, Elliott first saw the seals in 1872 as a special Treasury agent. While in the Pribilofs, Elliott learned the Aleut language, married a "native girl," and wit- nessed the spectacle of millions of barking, cavorting fur seals328 From that point on, he became one of the most vocal advocates of strict sealing regulations. According to historian Briton Busch, Elliott's belief that he alone knew how to estimate the seal population hindered his effective- ness. Hornaday referred to him as the "leading fur seal expert," but his enemies used less effusive language. Elliott's refusal to compromise and desire to be a martyr angered many of his fellow conservationists, but he had the attention of Congressmen." The primary difference of opinion between the two groups was about land killing, not pelagic. Beyond the need for both the treaty and efficiency, they agreed on very little. Hornaday and Elliott played the most important part in stopping a new twenty-year lease in 1910, because they were the first to raise the issue. Before the treaty though, their efforts at stopping land killing had been futile. The unity which the conservationists displayed for the treaty could not cover their fundamental differences. When the two groups combined their political clout they placed the burden of responsibility in the handsof Secretary of Commerce and Labor Charles Nagel. His primary qualifications for the job were his life-long support for the Republican Party and his part in Taft's campaign in 1908. He had served as the lawyer for Anheuser-Busch breweries for many years, before taking the Cabinet post. Nagel's attitude towards the seals was best displayed when he ordered a sealskin coat for his wife during the heat of thecontroversy.-' However, he performed admirably when faced with this unexpected crisis immediately after taking office. Nagel's sympathies were with the establishment conservationists, perhaps because they were businesslike. Nagel accepted any recommendation that bore Jordan's seal of approval. Jordan's allies analyzed the seal herds in terms of dollars lost or gained-just as Hornaday did, but they tended not to blame anyone. During his term, Nagel collected reports on Elliott, some dating back to 1875, which suggested his incompetence.3' On the other side, Hornaday</page><page sequence="10">36 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW FALL and Nagel exchanged a series of unpleasant letters, highlighted by Hornaday's "solemn warning not to commit an act that will be a grave error."32 The core of Nagel's responsibility for the seals was the management of the Pribilof herd. After much heated debate, Nagel, Secretary of State Philander Knox, Congress, and the conservationists all agreed that no new lease should be granted, because it would hinder the negotiation of a sealing treaty.3" The government had to buy all of the equipment on the island and make special provision for employing the resident Aleut Indians. In addition, government agents had to learn the entire system which the NACC had been operating for twenty years.34 Hornaday and Elliott were livid when they learned that sealing would continue under government auspices. In their opinion, the decision not to issue a new lease signalled that Taft and Congress wanted an end to all sealing on the Pribilofs. Hornaday asked Nagel "DID THE PRESIDENT...ORTHE UNIT'EDSTATESSENATE,IINTEND FOR ONE MOMENT THAT YOU SHOULD GO RIGHT ON IN THE BLOODY KILLING BUSINESS?" In case the answer remained in doubt, he answered "NO! A THOUSAND TIMES, NO! AND YOU KNOW IT." Congress, he claimed, intended that the law scrapping the lease would clear the way for an international ban on pelagic sealing by "Xclearing our hands of fur seal blood." Hornaday felt that Nagel had betrayed the American people, "who own the few surviving fur seals."35 The domestic negotiations which had led to Nagel taking control of the sealing business suggested that the conservationists were beginning to grasp the realitiesof resource protection in theinternational sphere. While they disagreed about what the status of the species would be after the treaty, they agreed that pelagic sealing had to go. Hornaday and Jordan both recognized that only a treaty could end pelagic sealing36 By bringing on serious treaty negotiations, the various conservationists had set the stage for a new type of international agreement. While the treaty negotiations pointed towards a new way to resolve a new type of dispute, some fairly traditional, great-power issues presented complications. First, the British/Canadian linkage often proved to be an impediment to rapid resolution of problems. Second, the methods of pelagic sealing left the Americans with some bitterness towards the Japanese and Canadians. Finally, the old antagonisms between the Russians and the Japanese threatened to abort the negotiations soon after the first session.</page><page sequence="11">1991 KURK DORSEY 37 The British/Canadian relationship had perplexed American diplomats for many years. The road to Ottawa traveled through London, and the Americans often watched diplomatic initiatives disappear somewhere over the Atlantic. A note from the State Department had to make its way throughboth the British and Canadian bureaucracies, which could take weeks. In 1905, Secretary of State John Hay actually died while waiting for the Canadians to respond to his draft treaty, which had many of the same principles as the one agreed to in 1911.37 The American bitterness towards the other sealing nations grew out of a suspicion of their methods. The Japanese were notorious for landingon the rookeries and scaring the seals into the water.N In one incident, Anerican guards killed eight Japanese sailors poaching seals.9 The Americans also believed that Canadian sealing ships often flew the Japanese flag to avoid the regulations of the Paris Tribunal. Nagel felt that he never had enough evidence to make an issue of it, but his suspicions remained.40 The most important dispute, though, was between Russia and Japan. The Russian Minister to Morocco, Pierre Botkine, arrived in Washington to negotiate the treaty with harsh words for the Japanese. First, he declared that his claims carried more weight because "long before Japan was heard of Russia was there and held the right to hunt seals." Still smarting from 1905, Botkine continued: 'Japan's assertion of the same rights there as Russia was one of the causes of the late war. Who ever heard of Japan twenty years ago? Can you imagine them putting in such a demand? Who are they, but upstarts?"41 The Japanese, fortunately, were better behaved than Botkine. That the Japanese showed up at all for the negotiations was surprising. Despite the many calls for talks, no one ever explained why the Japanese would want to come to the table. An end to pelagic sealing was no victory for Japan, and the United States had made no offer of compensation to the Japanese. In addition, the Japanese had a fairly advanced sealing fleet of 51 vessels prowling the North Pacific, which made themtheprimepractitionersof pelagic sealing.&lt; Presumably, they agreed to negotiate because they recognized the perilous future of their own sealing industry. The actual negotiation of the treaty revealed that the international arena would not be friendly to the conservationists, although they had set the agenda for the conference. In order to end pelagic sealing, the Russians and Americans had to do all of the talking to convince the Canadians and Japanese. With an American, Nagel, in charge of the conference, and a growing realization that the seals were</page><page sequence="12">38 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW FALL near extermination, the Americans could hope for success. After a string of failures dating to the 1890s, a treaty finally seemed in reach. The only obstacle to success was the discrepancy between the varying opinions as to who actually owned the seals. Resolution of this problem became the first priority for the diplomats involved. The Americans decided that the key to resolving the problem was to co-opt the Canadians. The British, as negotiators for Canada, guarded the freedom of international waters very jealously. During the talks, Joseph Pope, Canadian Under Secretary of State for External Affairs, explained that Canada's "right to pursue and capture wild animals in the open sea...is one she can agree to surrender only in return for compensation."43 If the Americans could get the British to back down on a question of freedom of the seas, then the Japanese would not be far behind. Remembering that Japan had a small herd of seals, Nagel negotiated a treaty giving the Canadians a 15% interest in the American herd if a resolution could be reached in the pelagic sealing dispute." By accepting, the Canadians had implicitly agreed that the owner of the islands owned the seals born there. Nagel then laid out his proposals to end pelagic sealing. His delegation presented a draft convention to the other powers on May 3, 1911, which became the basis for the later settlement. The first article committed the contracting nations to the prevention of pelagic sealing in the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean. Second, the draft treaty established rules for how to deal with pelagic sealers caught in the act. Third, the signatories would agree not to import sealskins collected illegally. There was no mention of compensation for the pelagic sealers or their home nations.4s With this proposal, the American delegation made a strong statement about ownership of a natural resource. The Americans asked the Japanese and Canadians to renounce their claims to the right to seal at sea. One member of the American delegation said that "There is certainly no reason why the United States should continue to protect and maintain its fur seals without profit and at considerable expense and annoyance to itself for the sole benefit of those engaged in the business of pelagic sealing." He then threatened that the United States had the right to wipe out the entire herd in order to reduce the risk of an international incident. In effect, the Americans insisted that they owned the Pribilof herd, and they could do with it what they wanted. The Russians, as protectors of the Commander Island herd, agreed completely with the American proposal."6 The American claim to proprietary rights rested largely on the fact that the Pribilof Island seals were born on American-owned territory.</page><page sequence="13">1991 KURK DORSEY 39 They did not spend time on anyone else's territory; therefore, they could not belong to anyone else. The Americans argued that they had to pay for the protection and regulation of the islands, and they should get the benefit thereof. The Japanese and Canadians took a much different view of the situation. Because the Canadians had accepted previous agreements at the Paris Tribunal in 1893 and earlier in 1911, the Japanese were left to carry out the defense of pelagic sealing. Baron Yasuya Uchida led the Japanese delegation; Hitoshi Duake, Chief of the Bureau of Fluvio- Marine Industries, provided the scientific advice. Uchida may not have known much about seals, but he certainly knew how to slow down the talks with constant requests for time for consultation?7 His tactics paid off in the long run as he obtained a treaty that granted Japan's demands for compensation. Baron Uchida did not accept the American view of seal ownership. He stressed that killing seals was the same whether done on the high seas or on land-in either case, the species could be destroyed. If anything, he argued, the Japanese had the original grievance because the Canadians had almost obliterated the Kurile herd long before the Japanese began pelagic sealing. Uchida made it clear that as an insular nation, Japan had to rely upon marine resources more than any other nation. He expressed the Canadian and Japanese version of seal ownership by stating that "While [the seals] live on the deep every nationality is at liberty to catch these animals, and any country possessing their breeding grounds can never reasonably claim the right of their exclusive ownership." Therefore, Uchida proposed that if the Russians and Americans felt so strongly about pelagic sealing, they should be willing to pay to rectify the situation." To reconcile the differences between the two sides, Uchida recommended three changes. First, the details about what could be killed and how the skins would be distributed would have to be set for the length of the treaty. Second, the nations with herds would have to allow foreign inspectors at any time to see them. Third, the nations with seals should compensate the pelagic sealers for the loss of their livelihood. In his words, 'the fruit of joint protection of fur seals...[shouldl be equitably shared by all,"49although he did not include nations that had never been involved in sealing. The Japanese were offering to sell their rights at a reasonable price. In a rudimentary way, each nation was trying to determine a dollar amount for its interest in the seal herd. During the negotiations, a sealskin fetched about thirty dollars, of which half went to the American government as profit. Based on the depleted herd of 1910,</page><page sequence="14">40 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW FALL Nagel calculated a profit of $250,000. Hornaday predicted that if the herd were protected adequately, it could produce a million dollar profit by 1920.5 Under such circumstances, the Americans were willing to pay a large sum to get the Japanese and Canadians out of such a lucrative business. The Americans did not know exactly what they were paying for. Valuing a male sealskin started with checking the going price in London, but under the extreme conditions of the Pribilofs, overhead was not easily calculated. The females were particularly difficult to evaluate. If one added up the potential offspring and generations that might issue forth from one female seal, any price might be a good deal. A moving, eating, reproducing resource did not fit into any standard economic framework. The delegates were trying to put a price on a part of an ecosystem, because they had no other way to think about the species. In the words of one Congressman, a seal was just like a sheep- an animal which humans could manage and harvest.51 The Americans did, however, recognize that they were setting a precedent for questions relating to other marine resources. In his call for enabling legislation, President Taft stated 'this convention is important in that it furnishes an illustration of the feasibility of securing a general international game law for the protection of other mammals of the sea."52 Several months earlier, the New York Times had hailed the treatyas "the first definite step toward the elaborationof an international game law."5 The possibilityof such a treaty appealed to most concerned Americans. During the bargaining, the powers agreed to meet later and negotiate treaties for sea-lions, whales, walruses and plumage birds.54 Unfortunately, they never fulfilled their promise. Despite the pitfalls and misunderstandings, the final treaty satisfied all of the parties involved. The Americans and Russians finally put an end to legal pelagic sealing, and the treaty contained provisions for dealing with the illegal kind. Both nations were free to set their own quotas for the killing of bachelor seals. Most importantly, they both received international recognition of their proprietary rights to seals born on their territory. On the other side, the Japanese and Canadians received lucrative cash settlements. Each nation was to get a $200,000 advance, and 15% from the Russian and American seal harvests. Without a treaty, the seals would have disappeared in a few years; with this treaty, all parties could look forward to the efficient exploitation of a valuable natural resource. Although the treaty put an end to pelagic sealing, it did not signal an end to the controversy in the mind of the Homaday wing of the conservationists. In the year following the signing of the treaty,</page><page sequence="15">1991 KURK DORSEY 41 Hornaday reopened the issue as to whether or not the seals should be killed at all. Using theopportunity presented by theenablinglegislation, Hornaday fought to establish a closed season on the killing of seals. He succeeded by backing his opponents into a scientific debate, and then using his public relations skills to win the argument. By doing so, Hornaday effectively altered the terms of the treaty. The gist of the argument over land killing had not really changed since the signing of the treaty. However, Congress had changed. For the first time in the Progressive era, the Democrats had taken control of the House in 1910. When Congress finally hammered out the enabling legislation, it included a five year closed season on seal killing, despite opposition from Taft, Nagel and Jordan. Hornaday overwhelmed this phalanx of opposition with tenacity, persuasiveness, and a Democratic House. Hornaday argued that the Russian experience demonstrated that the seal population needed at least ten years of protection to recover fully, although he would settle for five. Land killing in the past had left too little margin for error, so he was concerned that the population needed to be robust when the sealing resumed. Even with pelagic sealing banned, he feared that poor management could push the seal into extinction. A closed season, he predicted, would return the seal population to a million by 1921, and land killing could be resumed then.5 In response, his opponents argued that in order to insure the health of the seal herds, the surplus males had to be killed. These males, if not harvested, would grow to be full-sized bulls, which would fight for mates. With a huge surplus of bulls, there would be constant fighting in the rookeries leading to the deaths of females and pups. If the young males were superfluous, then it would be a waste not to harvest them.5 However, the validityof this argument was questionable. In effect, these scientists were arguing that the seals had evolved a suicidal tendency. Hornaday and his friends at the New York Times made short work of that argument by questioning the scientific knowledge of such men as Jordan. The Times turned Jordan's argument on its ear and suggested that he had actually proved that the seal needed a closed season. The editor then asked if Jordan had forgotten Darwin's lessons about natural selection. Hornaday replied to the trampled seal theory by exclaiming: "As if a wild species does not know how to breed and multiply successfully without the help of man!"' To Congressmen and editors alike, Jordan's plan must have seemed very risky-if the herd was really in danger, then more killing did not make sense. Hornaday,</page><page sequence="16">42 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW FALL however,could musteran historical example-the Russianexpenence- and a cautious approach to coincide with his vigorous and sincere personality. His ace in the hole, however, was the charge of corruption and mismanagement against government employees. Even before the treaty, Hornaday referred to one government official as the "Evil Genius of the Fur Seal." He charged that the officials on the Pribilofs allowed females and pups to be killed in an effort to maximize profit.`8 His evidence regarding the killing of females was slim, and that regarding pups was simply a mistake. But in a politically charged atmosphere, Hornaday was able to make some mud stick, while exulting his friend, Henry Elliott. Perhaps because Hornaday really believed his claims to be true, he managed to persuade many Congressmen, even when the Administration turned against him. Nagel and his associates could answer the charges, but they also involved themselvesinmudslinging. Although mistakeshappened, the number of females killed was very small, as government agents were quick to point out. Also, Nagel was able to demonstrate that the misunderstanding about killing young seals came from a report from a London furrier, C. N. Lampson. The furrier referred to most skins as "0pups," no matter what the size.- Only a few were below the lower limit allowed by law. While refuting the charges, the government officialscould notavoidreturningthebarbs. Nagel said thatHornaday's charges "seem to me so utterly unworthy of consideration, that I did not give them much attention."' One particularly bitter supporter of Nagel and Jordan wrote that 'It is part of the general lack of education in this country that a man like Mr. Elliott is able to command attention."6' Despite their efforts, the establishment conservationists lost the battle over the closed season. Hornaday skated onto the thinnest ice when he dealt with the legality of having a closed season. ArticleX stated that "nothing herein contained shall restrict the right of the United States at any time...to suspend the taking of sealskins....to protect and preserve the seal herd or to increase its number." Hornaday took this to mean that the treaty was designed for those purposes. In April, 1912, the Times agreed with him on its editonral page.62 Hornaday did have a solid legal argument that sealing could be suspended under the terms of the treaty. As the man in charge of putting together the treaty, though, Nagel felt that Hornaday advocated the violation of the spirit of the treaty. He argued that the point of the treaty was to find an equitable way to continue sealing operations. To Nagel, Hornaday's action seemed like a deliberate attempt to undermine the treaty. No matter</page><page sequence="17">1991 KURK DORSEY 43 what his intent, Hornaday had damaged the treaty irreparably, Nagel thought. In answer to a complaint that the other powers were not doing their part to enforce the treaty, Nagel replied that he could not complain because the American enabling legislation was a greater violation of the treaty. 63 While Hornaday had the legality figured out, Nagel's position was more reasonable. The diplomats had not intended for the United States to ban all sealing, except in emergency situations. A continued closed season would have given Japan a solid pretext for withdrawing from the agreement, which would have brought a return to pelagic sealing. No doubt Hornaday believed he was taking advantage of a loophole in the law, but his zeal for the seals might have cost them their protection. In 1920, William Hornaday was able to look back on the North Pacific Fur Seal Treaty with fond memories. The seal and the industry it supported, which both seemed near death in 1910, had rebounded splendidly. Since the closed season was lifted in 1917, Hornaday pointed out, the number of skins taken had risen each year. Even more amazing, the price per skin had shot up to $140. Just as Hornaday had predicted, the government could look forward to a million dollar profit from the fur seal industry in 1920. Meanwhile, the former pelagic sealing nations took their 15% of the profits and agreed that the treaty was a complete success. Domestically, the treaty and the accompanying legislation revealed the impact of conservationist ideas on the American political system. Efficiency still dominated conservationist thought and spilled over into other realms of endeavor, but it was slowly losing its grip on the movement. While still associated with Progressivism, conservationism found itself changing during the 1910s. Conservationists still thought in terms of maximum sustainable yields, even with the lovable fur seal. But throughout the conservation movement, attitudes were beginning to change. Hornaday could not resist speaking of the seals in anthropomorphic terms, and even Taft and Nagel said that the primary issue was conservation, not profit. The seeds of species preservation were sprouting in the rocky minds of powerful men. Conservationism was in a state of flux in this decade; the seals formed a temporary bridge between two alternative theories of conservation. In the international arena, the treaty accomplished two things. First, it saved the seal from extinction. Had the hunting pressures gone unchecked, the fur seal surely would have joined the bison and the passenger pigeon at the top of the list of American ecological disasters.</page><page sequence="18">44 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW FALL Second, the treaty proved that international natural resource issues, no matter how unusual, could be solved. Once the negotiators got around the threats to destroy the seals or declare war, they were able to agree ona cooperative approach. By adopting the conservationist doctrine of efficiency, the four nations came to a mutually satisfactory arrangement that saved the seal. Despite the hopes of many, the seal treaty has yet to become a model of international cooperation. The convergence of events in 1909 that forced the United States govern-ment to reconsider its position has yet tobe repeated. Likewise, the level of cooperation on theinternational level was unusual. Finally, the subject of the treaty was even more unusual. Of all of the commercially valuable animals, few were liable to be harvested in two mutually exclusive ways. The combination of international waters and territorial islands made the seal a unique case. While the terms of the North Pacific Fur Seal Treaty may never serve as a model, one can hope that the spirit of cooperation and willingness to take risks will. After twenty years of traditional power politics, the four nations discovered the possibilities of cooperation. Years of conflict had pushed the seals to the brink of extinction, much as many modern ecological crises are reaching critical points. In such a situation, every nation involved must forsake short-term, selfish interests. The future of the planet is at stake. * I would like to thank Professor Gaddis Smith for his assistance in sharpening both my thesis and my prose. l Arthur McEvoy, 77T Fisherman's Proben Ecology and Law in the California Fisheries, 1850-1980 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986), 10. 2 Samuel Flagg Bemis, Diplomatic History of the United States (New York Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1955), 413. 3 Britton Busch, The War Against the Seals (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1985), 95-6. 4 Busch, 96-98. 5 Busch, 96.
