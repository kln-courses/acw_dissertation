<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Architectural Tie Beam in Transition, Solomon Islands Deborah Waite Department of Fine Arts, University of Hawai'i at Manoa Introduction This paper, which was delivered at the Fiftieth Annual Conference of the Society of Architectural Historians, has two goals. One is to evaluate two representational strategies utilized on the same object type as it appears within different regional and national social contexts. In so doing, the other goal of the paper is developed, namely, the assem blage in one document of recorded descriptions of painted tie beams and wall boards from custom houses in the southeast Solomon Islands. The descriptions have been extracted from the recorded observations of visitors to the Solomons over an extended period of time — from 1568 to the present; most of the accounts come from the writings of explorers and missionaries of the middle to late 19th century. The term tie beam refers to horizontal boards that span all or part of the width of a structure and rest on supportive posts ranged along the sides. They are found in the southeast Solomons in custom houses; although some custom houses appear to lack them entirely. Wall boards in custom houses are made of single boards secured horizontally along the side and end walls and constitute the uppermost boards of the walls proper. The focus and point of departure for this paper is the long wooden beam, crowded with carved and painted imagery, that is mounted just beneath the central windows on the facade of the Solomon Islands National Museum in Honiara (Fig. i). The tie beam was carved by "Naitoro and his work men from Hauhui, West 'Are'Are, Malaita in 1990 when they erected the structure and thatched the roof over Figure i. Detail of facade of Solomon Islands National Museum showing tie beam, (photo by Waite) July 1997 97</page><page sequence="2">the entrance to the museum" (Personal Communication, Lawrence Foanaota, Museum Director, 24/4/97). The beam resembles the elabo rately ornamented horizontal tie beams and wall boards in custom houses (canoe houses, council houses) from the Makira/Ulawa Province, southeast Solomon Islands.1 In its present position on the museum facade, the carved beam functions as a recontextualized 'message' — a visual referent to the carved and painted beams from custom houses past and present in the southeast Solomon Islands. Both similarities and differences between this exterior wall beam and the interior tie beams and wall beams from the southeast Solomons reflect the needs or demands of a different context, that of the Solomon Islands nation as opposed to the local requirements of people living in the southeast region of the island group. The Solomons became an independent nation in 1978, and this carved beam decoration as well as other features of the museum (to be discussed below) reflect this post-independence national modality. Comparison between the museum tie beam and beams/wall boards from custom houses in the south east region will reveal the visual changes which man ifest this new political reality. Historical Background Carved and painted tie beams, wall boards and, on occasion, gable boards, have for centuries distin guished custom houses in the southeast Solomon Islands. Although the size of images depicted on the beams is only inches high compared with the larger figures carved on houseposts, these images repeat edly attracted the attention of European visitors to the islands. First among them was the Spanish expe dition captained by Alvaro de Mendana in 1568. Gomez Catoira (1901:355), a principal member or the expedition, recorded impressions of "...a very large and broad temple, wherein were painted many figures of devils with horns like those of goats." The editors, Amherst &amp; Thomson, of Catoira's (ibid) work note that the temples referred to were oha, canoe houses, or public halls, and the paintings and carvings of sea-ghosts ...very common in this district might easily be mistaken for devils with horns." John Webster (1863:87), of the British ship Wanderer recorded more fully his impressions of Figure 2. "House of Images, Makira Bay, 1851. (Makira/San Cristobal Island).Webster/Angus. Library, Auckland Institute and Museum. 98 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="3">what he termed 'the house of images' at Makira Bay, San Christobal Island in 1851: ...On one of the beams of the same building was a grotesque representation of a battle, exe cuted by a native artist, lhere were hgures or the dead and wounded; one party evidently routed and escaping to their canoes, while the victors were slaughtering the captured2 Webster's drawing of the 'House of Images' (Fig. 2) reveals a section of what does appear to be a bat tie scene depicted on one of the side wall beams. The figures adopt active stances and appear to be hold ing aloft weapons, possibly the roromaraugi club shields employed in this area. Other features of the house recorded by Webster — the gable carving, prominent carved anthropomorphic supporting post, as well as the shell-inlaid up-curving prows of several canoes — have much greater prominence in his illustration than the tiny figures rendered along one wall board. Yet it is this board with its repre sentation of a 'battle scene' that absorbed Webster's attention. Father Leopold Verguet, one of the first Catholic (Marist) missionaries to attempt settlement in the same region, recorded details of another alleged bat tle scene in what he called the 'palais of Mahemara, leader, or big-man, of a village then termed 'One' in the Sainte-Marie harbor. Unlike Webster, Verguet noted the presence of twelve anthropomorphic sup portive posts, described each as 'une grossière statue' but offered no further details. The carved and paint ed 'scène'was another matter: Two designs are represented in the middle of the supporting beams, the one a victory won on the mountain of the island, the other the capture of a large ship. The laws of perspec tive are strangely violated there; the warriors are presented all on the same plane, all of the same size, walking (marching) one behind the other; the dead are distinguished from the liv ing in that they have the head below and the feet in the air; and the artist, faced with repre senting two combattants, places them on the heads of the others at the height of the clouds. You see, if design is not foreign to San Christoval, it is still in its early infancy. And so, it is necessary to view our islanders as being enthusiastic about European imagery as evidenced by their leaps and cries of admira tion. (translation from Verguet 1854:134—35)' Verguet's account typifies European evaluations of imagery in its ethnocentric account of rendition that ignores the 'laws of perspective' and in his attempts to 'interpret' the manner of distinguishing the living from the dead and, most particularly, the nature of the events — the capturing' of a large ship and a battle victory. His evaluation of this method of design as being 'in its infancy' belongs to the same Eurocentric mode of thinking. On the other hand, Verguet concludes his description with remarks which, while still Eurocentric, characterize the dec orated custom house as a complex of interrelated, II I i Ï THE TWO Pit ES Of A.

(Translation from ibid).4 In 1865, Julius L. Brenchley, a passenger on the British ship H.M.S. Curacoa viewed and acquired a large ornamented wooden tie beam measuring fif teen feet, one-eighth inch, from a 'council house' on Ugi Island. (Fig. 3, 3a &amp;3b) and now in the Maidstone Museum, Maidstone, Kent, UK.5 Brenchley's (1873:260) journal reveals nothing about the process of acquisition except to say that it was "procured through the kindness of Bishop Patteson" (1873:260). Patteson was head of the Melanesian Mission and had been aboard the Mission ship Southern Cross on one of its annual cruises through the islands.^ Brenchley records a precise description of the tie beam from Ugi Island. On one side: ioo Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="5">The groundwork is divided into two compart ments, ornamentally separated from one another, each containing two canoes. In one of the canoes of either group is to be seen a raised platform, the one in the right group bearing a bowl, the other in the left group being without one. It has been surmised that there is here a reference to a custom among some of these islanders of propitiating the sharks by an offering in the shape of a liba tion, and that the canoe not upset or attacked has performed the ceremony. The two canoes in the right compartment may be supposed to be moving on with the protecting bowl. But all this, of course, is mere conjecture. Most of the men in the canoes are represented as wearing high combs projecting from their heads, and one, singularly enough, is decorat ed with the by no means delectable hat, which, I suppose, I may be permitted to call the hat of civilization. (Brenchley 1873:261—2) The Reverend Robert Codrington, a member of the Melanesian Mission who visited missions in the Solomons many times between 1863 and 1887, pro vides the most detailed extant account of the paint ings, in particular, paintings from a large custom house at Wango village, San Christobal Island: The great curiosity of the village is now old — neglected. When I was here before, it was fresh and brilliant. It is a boat house — a building used also for public purposes and was most elaborately decorated with carving and color. Every post is carved into the figure of a man or a monster and every bit of it for merly was colored black, red and white. The most curious and interesting things were a series of scenes cut in oudine on what may be called the principal boards of the roof. The outlines are cut in and filled with white, or they would have perished before this. They represent preparations for a feast and the feast itself, fishing for various kinds of fish and what is very curious, the demons of the air, most fantastic figures, shooting at the people in the canoes, [cf. Brenchley tie beam]. On the other side there is the picture of a battle in which not very much is going on, but it is quite Assyrian. The fight is on the sea shore and the foreground is filled with fish to shield it. Round the middle pillars and below the figures are larger pictures of dances done very fairly... (Codrington 1872: 46-47; cf. Codrington 1891: 258—9) (Fig. 4).7 The beam bears images of fish and birds carved in high relief on the opposite surface: sharks, boni to and seven frigate birds (cf. Waite 1987:17). Figure 4. 'A Village Hall, Uji, Solomon Islands." (photo by Codrington as published in Brenchley 1873: facing p. 262) Like Brenchley and all who gazed upon these painted scenes, Codrington appears to have been struck by the active movement of images depicted in what he interpreted as complex narrative scenes. Unfortunately, the scenes in question are not con veyed in illustration, but drawings of individual fig ures which Codrington subsequently published as 'native drawings' demonstrate the liveliness of these figures as well as their composite nature (e.g. Codrington 1890:197, 25). Many were said to be sea spirits and as such were comprised of both fish and anthropomorphic features. This image type occurred independently within the decorative scheme of custom houses as gable ornaments and carved in low relief on supportive posts (Fig. 5). Such a full descriptive account of the scenes as viewed and recorded by Codrington results in a con vincing account for readers, conveying a strong July 1997 101</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5. Interior of custom house, village, Santa Ana Island, (photo by Donald Yacoe) degree of validity even though there is no mention as to whether any of the information was provided by islanders who could have furnished data about the depicted feasts and could have established if the battle was really a battle, not a ritual battle reinac tion. Sea spirits could have been identified as such rather than being described as "demons of the air... fantastic figures shooting at the people in the canoes, a commonly believed practice of sea spirits" (cf. Ivens 1927:202-3). Codrington's re-creation, like all verbal recreations, is what we are given. In light of this, it is interesting to note comments written by Codrington in a letter to his brother Tom about Brenchley's account of a tie beam in his jour nal that had been published in 1873. I have had Brenchley's book on board (the Melanesian mission ship Southern Cross) and have been amused at it and more than that I think his general views are good. It is one other example, however, of what I find every where — the traveller put his own notions into the actions or works of savages and then the philosophers at home quote him as an authority., I remember particularly the account he gives of the carved and painted board, the frontispiece of the book, in which he calls a bow resting on the spear rests in one of the canoes a kind of altar and builds a the ory thereon, (letter from Codrington to Tom dated 21 October 1874 in Codrington 1874) Following an 1873 voyage, the traveller C.F. Wood (1875:133) described still another elaborately decorated house at Cape Recherche on the north west coast of San Christobal (Makira) Island: In the town I came on some most elaborately carved houses; the owner of the best one that I saw seemed very proud of his establishment; on the cross beams were carved fish and birds in high relief, and between these carvings were grotesque paintings representing fishing parties in canoes, rainbows, waterspouts, etc. I confess I should hardly have guessed what some of the subjects were had they not been explained to me... (Fig. 6) The photograph was taken not by Wood but by his photographer, a Mr. George Smith. Like the Codrington photograph (Fig. 4), it situates the view er within the house and allows him or her to occu Figure 6. Custom house, Makira Island. 1873.

This contrasts with the photograph of the tie beam obtained by Julius Brenchley (Fig. 3) in which both sides of the same beam are superimposed so as to be read simultaneously, an impossible phenomenon in actuality. This custom house, apparently unlike the other two visited by Guppy, possessed a considerable amount of painted imagery. The contextualized view of beams within house in the Wood (Smith) photograph may reveal why few photographs or drawings accompany the detailed verbal records of complex scenes on tie beams and wall boards. Small figures are just barely visible in the second beam from the front in the Wood (Smith) photograph; the three-dimensional fish carvings are far more prominent. The beam sur faces facing the front opening of the custom houses would have received much more light from the out side in contrast to the opposite surfaces where, if the Brenchley photograph is any indication, most of the detailed narrative scenes were depicted. The last of the 19th-century accounts of custom house paintings comes from H.B. Guppy, surgeon on the British surveying ship Lark, which sailed among the Solomon Islands in 1881. Guppy described three custom houses (he termed them tambu houses) in considerable detail, one each on Santa Ana, San Cristobal, and Santa Catalina islands. Guppy, among all of the observers, provid ed dimensions for the houses; the carved house posts present on all three houses merited his particular attention. But it was the custom house on Santa Catalina that, in his words was "worthy of a few spe cial remarks." Dimensions of the house were com parable to those of like buildings in this part of the group, the length being between 60 and 70 feet. Placed in front of each of its ends are three circles of large wooden posts driven into the earth, each circle of posts being 4 or 5 feet in height and enclosing a space of ground a few feet across, into which are thrown cocoanuts and other articles of food to appease the hunger of the presiding deity or devil-god. (Guppy 1887:69) Guppy went on to mention that the central row of posts were "defaced by chipping which I was informed was a token of mourning for the late chief of the island who had died no many months before" (ibid.) The ridge poles and posts are painted with numerous grotesque representations in outline of war canoes and fishing parties, of natives in full fighting equipment, of sharks and of the devil god himself, with a long lank body and a tail besides. On a ridgepole there was drawn in paint the outline of some waggon or other vehicle with the horse in the shafts; whether this was a reminiscence of some native who had been to the colonies, or was merely a copy from a picture I did not learn. Some of the representations on the ridge-pole were of an obscene character. (ibid.) Subject matter appears to repeat itself. Guppy, like Webster, Verguet, Wood, and Codrington observed what appeared to be fishing parties, bat tles, and the ever-present sea spirit (the "devil-god with a long lank body and a tail besides"). Like Codrington, he had read Brenchley's published journal and supplied a description of the beam acquired by Brenchley from what Guppy termed the public hall' on Ugi Island (ibid.:7o). And, like Brenchley, Wood, and Codrington, he published an illustration of the front of a custom house (from Santa Ana) as an accompaniment to his several descriptions, thus reiterating one of the principal features of documentation of interior paintings — an absence of visual record. This could well be due primarily to technical or practical concerns; numer ous writers describe the dark interiors of these hous es wherein numerous small painted images would have been difficult to photograph and would not often have been visible in distance views of a house facade. Practical issues notwithstanding, it is curi ous that imagery that so intrigued these visitors was not recorded photographically or in the form of sketches or detailed drawings. (Webster is the only exception here.) Codrington and Wood succeeded in photographing the carved and painted beams and wall boards, but their photographs privilege the three-dimensional images of birds and fish also carved on the beams; moreover, their photographs were not chosen for their published texts. An illus tration of the tie beam acquired by Brenchley was included in the (posthumous) publication of his journal, but only after it had been extricated from July 1997 103</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7.

One exception is a 'decorative panel' carved in 1947 for a festival, or custom, house (purchased in 1966 by the anthropologist, Dr. William Davenport). The artist who carved the panel was Karopungi of Geta village in the Star Harbour region of San Christobal (Makira Island) represents another manifestation of the ornament ed tie beam/wall board tradition. (Fig. 7).8 The relief panel continues the tradition of fishing scenes; it depicts a canoe in the midst of a sea of bonito fish. Three fishermen with elaborate headdresses were intended to represent initiates into the cult of ritu al bonito fishing; the headdresses were worn only at that time. Large figures standing on each side of the boat stand on the bonito fish that the fishermen are attempting to catch, thus intentionally obstructing the process; the two figures depict sea spirits of the same type observed by Codrington decades earlier (Davenport 1968:24-26). Painted scenes on the wall boards, tie beams, and gable boards of custom houses erected in Natagaro village, Santa Ana Island in 1973 (rebuilt after a cyclone had destroyed every house in Nataghera, Ghupuna, and Nafinuatogho villages of Santa Ana in 1971 — vide Tedder 1975:10—23) bear scenes of fish, sea spirits, and men in a fishing canoe. Plant life, a rainbow, and the use of a fishing kite are depicted in these paintings. Gables of the two main decorated custom houses are ornamented with fish represented in numbers as though swimming over the gable boards. Comparison of these examples, from the earliest (Webster 1851) to the latest (in Santa Ana in the 1970s) reveals obvious differences in the handling and spac ing of images and alleged subject matter ranging from war to feasts to fishing expeditions. Above all, there appears to be an overriding continuity in the attempt to depict groups of images — images that move and interact with one another in contrast to the single images portrayed on other parts of a custom house (e.g. supportive posts, gable carvings, relief carving on the lower portion of some posts). European visitors were obviously attracted to what they regarded as narrative scenes of battles, feasts, and fishing expeditions. The energy displayed by so many figures in these scenes of battle, feasting and fishing, the seemingly curious head projections variously interpreted as "goats' horns or head combs," but above all their portrayal in groups allowing the scenes to be designated as narrative (a phenomenon of much European and Near Eastern visual recording) seem to explain this fascination. It appears that the viewers could 'relate' to these groups of images far more readily than to singly depicted images. Locally, the single images func tioned emblematically in reference to history and rituals, a process that probably escaped Western viewers for whom scenes of interacting images con stituted a more direct translation of group activities, I04 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="9">be they battles, fishing expeditions, feasts, within or outside ritual contexts. Why, then, were scenes of figures actively engaged in enterprises portrayed on the beams and wall boards of certain custom hous es and what required this particular interactive mode of representation? The absence of adequate field research regarding the content of scenes painted on tie beams and wall boards from the southeastern Solomons (Makira/Ulawa Province) inhibits evaluation of the scenes and their active participants, but at the same time, it allows for supposition. It should be empha sized, however, that there is no way of accurately assessing the content of these scenes, that is to say, their meaning for the indigenous audience of the rel evant time periods and the particular custom hous es. The scenes of feasts, so-called warring parties, and fishing expeditions quite probably referred to specific events within the immediate history of the particular custom house and associated people — a history that was permanently recorded through these paintings but whose specificity cannot com municate to later generations of people living beyond the region/custom house within which the paintings existed. The fishing scenes could have documented actu al fishing expeditions or could have referred to the once elaborate boys' initiation ceremony into adult hood, the maraufu (Santa Ana Island) (cf. malaohu, Ulawa Island and the Sa'a district of Malaita Island)?1. This reading of the fishing scenes is docu mented only in the example recorded by Davenport (1968: 25). Male puberty initiation in this part of the Solomon Islands has traditionally involved initia tion into the cult of the bonito fish, which has always been at one and the same time a valuable source of food and major cult object. In brief, the initiation involved the incorporation of young boys into the community through the agency of the fishing process or, indeed, of the bonito itself. Davenport (1981:5) recorded that according to his informants on the island of Santa Catalina (another of the small islands in this region) the initiation rite was called 'initiation to bonito' (maraufu ni waiau), but also with a connotation of transformation and change, which is one meaning of the lexical form mara-. The initiation involved an actual fishing trip in which a boy undergoing initiation caught his first bonito and, as one of the first ritual means of demonstrat ing total identity with the bonito, held the fish close to his own body. Subsequent rituals further served to 'bond' the boy with the bonito (cf. Mead 1973: 74). Battle scenes such as those recorded by Webster, Verguet, and Guppy, could have been just that (i.e. battles of local or regional significance) or they could have referred to a simulated battle ritual adopted by 'warriors' who would run to the shore brandishing their weapons to greet visitors to the final day of ini tiation festivities (cf. Mead 1973: 76-77). The final day of a maraufu initiation involved the return of the initiated boys into the community as men. The boys mounted an elaborately decorated platform, a procedure which guaranteed them max imum visibility in the eyes of the community in which they would, from that point onward, partici pate as men. Recorded information about malaohu platforms is fairly limited and visual records consist largely of two-dimensional diagrams (Fox 1985: 188-9; Ivens 1927:132). An exception, a group of pho tographs of the platform used at the last held initia tion at Ghupuna village, Santa Ana, in 1943 (cf. Mead 1973) reveal remarkable parallels with interior tie beams and wall boards of custom houses — partic ularly in the three-dimensional images of birds and fish that were carved on both indoor and outdoor beams. A bonito fishing canoe appears in three dimensional carved form on the outdoor initiation platform (Mead 1972:76-77). I suggest that partici pants in this final segment of initiation, e.g. the newly initiated boys on top of the platform, could be viewed as referents or correspondents to painted interacting figures — either those figures portrayed in the initiation bonito fishing expedition or those participating in fishing expeditions that would con tinually provide food for their community. Both sets of structural elements, the interior tie beams/wall boards and the outdoor malaohu initia tion platforms were united visually through com mon referential signifiers and as structural elements provided the cultural framework for permanent and temporary reiterative commemoration of custom. In so doing, they may be said to have guaranteed or ensured its perpetuation and that of the life cycle. This form of commemorative narrative, rather than narrative in the European sense of recorded sequen tial events linked within a linear time sequence, was a probable function of the scenes on decorated tie beams, wall boards, and their exterior equivalents, July 1997 105</page><page sequence="10">Figure 8.

Fish casket, Santa Ana Island. British Museum 1904:6-2111113. (photo courtesy of the British Museum) boards comprising the malaohu initiation platforms (together with their actual living participants).10 Any custom house also used as a canoe house contained numerous referents not only to bonito fishing but many subsequent episodes in the lives of these fishing communities. Anthropomorphic house posts alluded to initiates, to spirits whose sup port was essential in the effective conduct of all actions (cf., e.g., Davenport 1967:9-11). Bonito fish ing canoes as well as canoes utilized on trading and other expeditions,, occupied the canoe houses as did — and still do — carved wooden bowls, model bonito canoes and wooden sharks which house(d) the bones and skulls, respectively, of deceased men of leadership status(cf. Figs. 4,5). In short, the archi tectural ornament was, indeed still is, a veritable installation or visual summation of all aspects and stages of life, recalled emblematically, so that a sin gle carving could connote a complex of events, aes thetics, rituals, and life of these islanders. All of these objects, like the scenes painted on wall boards and tie beams, involve movement — either actual fishing or travelling in a canoe, or metaphoric, as initiation or death. Movement from one place to another involves transition, which, depending upon the circumstances, may also signi fy transformation, initiation, and other rites of pas sage. Canoes, both the large trading canoes and the bonito canoes employed in fishing expeditions were, and still are, the principal vehicles of movement that effect this multi-dimensional category of move ment. And elaborately ornamented wooden bowls, -— some in the form of canoes, others fashioned as fish or birds — signified the same phenomenon and were also kept in custom houses. The ornamented bowls and other artifacts used on socially significant occasions marking movement frequently depict creatures in motion. Fish, for example, may be depicted as though swimming through the sides of a wooden feast bowl (cf., Davenport 1967:13). Frigate birds, which were close ly associated with the bonito fish (as they appear to vie with bonito for smaller fish — their common food) are represented with outspread wings as though flying. Anthropomorphic figures, whether they refer to spirits or ancestors or non-ancestral sea spirits, exhibit action through posture expansive arm gestures (Fig. 8). Two examples of mechanically movable figures adorned the initiation platform constructed for the last malaohu initiation at Gupuna village, Santa Ana (1943). One of the upper corners of the richly adorned platform was a life-sized carving of a man with a fighting spear in his hand and this figure could be turned so as to make it appear as though the spear would be thrown. On the other corner was a movable figure of July 1997 107</page><page sequence="12">Figure 10. Shell breast ornament. Southeast Solomon Islands. British Museum 1929, 7-13, 60.

(Mead 1973:74-75) Tie Beam on Solomon Islands National Museum To return to the tie beam represented on the facade of the Solomon Islands National Museum(Fig. 1): this non-structural exterior tie beam displays a series of non-interrelated images carved in high relief; painted horizontal and vertical wave-like patterns provide a background that establishes the sea-relat ed locale of the islands. Carved relief images include sharks, birds with outspread wings, turtles, and anthropomorphic figures. These last are represented singly at the mouth end of sharks and, at the left end of the beam, in copulation. Except for the copulat ing pair, the anthropomorphic and other images exhibit little action and little interaction. Each image or image pair depicted on this tie beam repro duces an image or artifact typically found in a canoe house from the southeast region, e.g., anthropo morphic supporting posts, including the copulating couple, cf. Bernatzik 1936: 111), fish caskets (Fig. 9), turtles, which are clan emblems on Santa Ana Island, and the ever-present bird with extended wings (Fig. 10). Implications of action among these images are recognizable only if the prototypes are known to the io8 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="13">Figure n. Model custom house from Makira/Ulawa province. Grounds of Solomon Islands National Museum, 1996. (photo by Waite) viewer. The copulating couple is one example of this. The significance of the anthropomorphic figures positioned at the tip ends of sharks' mouths is clear only if a viewer is familiar with fish caskets employ ing the same theme and the local interpretive specifics of these particular caskets. One example was carved by artist Tarofimana of Nataghera village, Santa Ana, to commemorate the death of a man, Okua, at the hands of a shark in the early 1960s (Davenport 1967:12). The beam replication on the principal facade of the museum appears to belong to a post Independence (1978) mode of referential or em blematic symbology in which an image selected for reproduction refers visually to the image-making system of a particular region, in this case, the south eastern islands of Makira/Ulawa Province. Similarly the contents of the museum also represent artifacts and other items from each island district. National symbols at the museum include not only the tie-beam carving adorning the facade of the main building but also model custom houses repre sentative of each district in the island nation set up in the museum grounds (Fig. 11). The houses, though much smaller than their prototypes, are technically and structurally faithful to regional types and are large enough to be entered and are intend ed to be experienced by individual visitors to the museum. The much larger prototypical custom houses are intended for correspondingly larger vil lage entities and multiple functions. The reproduction of images or artifacts consid ered to be representative of différent parts of the Solomon Islands nation also illuminate govern ment-sponsored or related documents and tourist brochures. Paper currency is just one example. One side of a $50 dollar bill incorporates images of a fish hook, dog bowls from the Makira District flanking a shell breast ornament from the Santa Cruz Islands, and a hand club from Malaita; while the obverse sur face includes representations of a figure from Ongtong Java and one of the anthropomorphic canoe prow figureheads once widely prevalent in the Western District. Several of these canoe figureheads also adorn the five-dollar bill, where they flank a scene of canoes taken from an old photograph. The artifacts represented belong, for the most part, to the collections of the Solomon Islands National Museum. The Solomon Islands Booklet, an information booklet for visitors and residents published by the Information Department, Office of the Prime Minister (199?), is just one example of publications in which designs have been borrowed from tradi tional three-dimensional sculpture, in this case, from the tie beam format. In the Booklet, these con July 1997 109</page><page sequence="14">stitute long horizontal panels, located at the bottom of certain pages are filled with designs traceable to the southeast islands and presented in series, as in the case of the museum tie beam. One exception is a panel filled with a scene of men paddling a canoe, a regionally traditional house, or large frigate bird, all within elements of a landand sea scape. The result, whether intentional or purely accidental, bears a closer resemblance to Micronesian tie beams — or their portable counterparts, the smaller sto ryboards — than to painted beams from the Solomons. National art, regardless of size or medium, expresses emblematically a common theme: recol lection of the history and traditions of regional provinces within the island nation; its commemo rative narrative preserving longstanding local cus toms and lore. Notes 1. The Makira/Ulawa Province includes the south east Solomon Islands of Makira or San Cristobal (also written as San Christoval, San Christobal), Santa Ana, Santa Catalina, Ugi (sometimes writ ten as Uki), and Ulawa. 2. John Webster (1863?:) was a friend of Benjamin Boyd, an American who assembled an expedition of two ships, the Wanderer and the Ariel, to cruise among the Pacific Islands with what Webster termed "a definite object in view. This was to establish a Papuan Republic or Confederation: to lay the foundation of some sort of social and political organization on which the simple machinery of an independent state might be afterwards erected... had death not cut short Mr. Boyd's career (he was killed in the Solomons)." Webster (i863?:8i-87) recorded in considerable detail his impressions of custom houses in Makira. 3. The original source of the English translation reads: Sur les solives du milieu, deux dessins, fig urent, l'un une victoire remportee sur les montagnards de l'île, l'autre la capture d'une grande barque. Les lois de la perspective y sont étrangement violees; les guerrieres se pré sentent tous sur le même plan, tous de la même taille, marchant à la suite l'un de l'autre; les morts se distinguent de vivante en se qu'ils ont la tête en bas et les pieds en l'air; et l'artiste embarrasse pour introduire deux combattants, les a places sur la tête des autres, a la hauteur des nuages. Vous le voyez, si le dessin n'est pas étranger à San Christoval, il y est encore dans le première enfance. Aussi faut il voir nos insulaires s'extasier devant les gravures européennes, et temoinger par des sauts et des cris toute leur admiration... (Verguet 1854: 234-5). 4. The oiginal source of the English translation reads: Enfin ces hangars sont autant de musées ou se trouvent réunis les chefs d'oeuvre de l'indus trie arossiènne, les plus jolies pirogues, les plats les mieux sculptés, et jusqu'à des instru ments de musique: ces derniers ne sont que des troncs d'arbre creuses; on frappe sur ces cylindres avec d'énormes bâtons, et il en sort un bruit assourdissant qui ressemble de loin au roulement de plusiers tambours. (Verguet ibid.) 5. For information regarding material obtained in the Solomon Islands by Brenchley and other pas sengers on the Curacoa, see Waite 1987. The tie beam is discussed on pp. 16-17. 6. The H.M.S. Curacoa embarked on a Pacific voy age to assess British interests in the Pacific. The ship encountered the Melanesian Mission ship, Southern Cross in the northern islands of Vanuatu. The Southern Cross was making its annual voyage through islands in eastern Melanesia where the mission had established schools. The commander of the Curacoa, Sir William Wiseman, had apparently arranged to meet the Southern Cross at this point after which the latter accompanied the Curacoa as it cruised through the Solomon Islands chain. (Anon 1866:334-336). 7. A photograph taken by Codrington of the inte rior of a custom house on Ugi Island was pub lished in the Brenchley journal (Brenchley 1873, Plate opposite p. 262), where it was titled, A Village Hall, Uji, Solomon Islands.' 8. The panel carved by Karopungi of Geta village, Star Harbour, San Cristobal was completed in 1947. It was purchased from the carver by Dr. William Davenport in 1966 and now belongs to the William Kohler Collection, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Like the other larger tie no Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="15">beam carvings from older custom houses, this beam, or panel is ornamented on both sides. Low-relief carving on one side (painted and ornamented with nautilus shell) depicts a boni to canoe with four fishermen; the reverse side displays three star motifs and two T-shaped crosses, together with drawings of two roosters. According to Davenport, the carver intended that one side of the carving depict the sea and the other the land. In the latter, Christian cross es were included because Christianity was just being accepted in his village at the time of carv ing. (Davenport, Personal Communication, 28 May 1997. 9. Extensive accounts of the malaohu initiation appear in Ivens (1927:130-147) and Fox (1925: 185-90). 10. Nicholas Thomas recently included the tie beam from Uki Island in a consideration of "indige nous narrative art likely to have been produced in the absence of exposure to Western models" but indicates that "Oceanic art was never limit ed to a single modality" — another way, perhaps, of suggesting that commemoration of ritual as well as historic events and their permanent and perpetual affective role in the sustenance of a community constituted the principal function of these paintings.
