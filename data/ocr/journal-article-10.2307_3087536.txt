The presence of euphemisms in the Hebrew Bible has long been observed, but until now an exhaustive treatment of the phenomenon has not appeared. In addition, scholars typically have treated the topic of euphemism in a rather general way with little attention to the broad range of linguistic phenomena represented by the term, or the literary, sociological, or histori- cal contexts in which euphemisms occur. It is in this light that the monograph under review represents a welcome, if not long overdue, contribution. A revised version of the author's 1998 dissertation at the University of Leipzig,' this book offers a careful and exhaustive examination of euphemistic linguistic phenomena in the Hebrew Bible. Its close attention to a variety of contexts and its methodological sophistication make it a useful and informative resource. Schorch begins his investigation by reviewing the various theoretical approaches to the study of euphemism, and by es- tablishing the parameters and methodology for his own work. Building upon recent linguistic approaches to euphemism in other languages, he distinguishes between the functions of eu- phemisms and the motivations for their use, and asserts that any investigation into motives must consider issues of seman- tic range and context. Thus, Schorch sets out to establish the semantic ranges for the various euphemisms under discussion and to analyze the linguistic strategies at work in their forma- tion (e.g., avoidance, substitution). His approach necessitates a brief review of previous research comparing euphemism with a variety of speech phenomena (e.g., dysphemism, lying, ad- dad words, double entendres, and a variety of tropes). Having established the groundwork for his investigation, Schorch then examines the topic of euphemism from three dia- chronic perspectives. The first involves a survey of euphemisms represented by textual corrections (VI1DD 'flp7'n) and by vari- ants in the textual witnesses. In this section Schorch first col- lects the euphemisms that appear in the recensions of the text of Samuel (i.e., 4QSama, Septuagint [LXX], Masoretic Text [MT]), and then organizes them into seven thematic categories. In the first category Schorch places variants that constitute euphemistic references to death. Here he includes the MT and 4QSama versions of 1 Sam 1:11 in which Hannah promises to dedicate her son to Yahweh all the days of "his life" (fern), a line that the LXX reads as "his death" (OavdTou aOT0o). Schorch also compares the rendering "fall" (ircaoivTat) in the LXX and 4QSama (nd') of 1 Sam 2:33, to the MT, which reads "die" (Inln"). Also surveyed is the 4QSama version of 1 Sam 5:11 which reports the "panic of Yahweh (mV)," rather than the "panic of death," as found in the MT and LXX (nin, OavdTou). Schorch's second category, "Transzendenz Gottes," collects euphemisms that appear to avoid direct second-person refer- ence to mi';. Thus, Schorch compares the MT of 1 Sam 1:11 in which Hannah vows her baby "to Yahweh," to the LXX which reads "before you" (as if Hebrew 1'1D were implied). Similar variants in 1 Sam 1:21-22 and 2 Sam 2:21 are also examined. 1 An excursus of the original dissertation has appeared sepa- rately under the title "Baal oder Boschet? Ein umstrittenes theophores Element zwischen Religions- und Textgeschichte," ZAW 112 (2000): 598-611.</page><page sequence="2">608 Journal of the American Oriental Society 122.3 (2002) In the third thematic group Schorch gathers euphemisms that relate to the topic of anthropomorphism. Included here are 1 Sam 1:23 and 5:11. The MT of the former verse has Elkanah saying to Hannah "May Yahweh fulfill his word," whereas the verse in 4QSama and the LXX appears to give Hannah a bit of influence over Yahweh. It reads "fulfill the utterance of your mouth." The treatment of 1 Sam 5:11 focuses on the MT's ref- erence to God's destructive powers as "the hand of Yahweh," whereas 4QSama and the LXX read the "ark of God." Under the rubric "Polytheismus," Schorch discusses the re- censional differences of 2 Sam 7:23. Specifically, he compares a reference to "his tents" (n';7) in the 4QSama and the LXX (i.e., amciv&amp;ltaTa) to the MT, which renders it as "his gods" (n;7X). He also compares the MT's plural verb "went" (?1*,) used in reference to God, to the LXX and parallel passage in 1 Chron 17:21 which render as "his guide" (6ij6'yTJ?V a6T6V) and "went" (in the singular, 1o;7), respectively. Schorch's next thematic category, "JHWH," contains bibli- cal passages in which circumlocutions are used to express po- tentially objectionable references to "spurning the Lord" and "his word." Thus, the MT and LXX of 2 Sam 12:14 record the prophet Nathan reprimanding David: "you have spurned the enemies of Yahweh," though 4QSama has "you have spurned the word of Yahweh." How this category differs substantially from that of Schorch's "Transzendenz Gottes" group is unclear. Schorch's last two categories focus on apparent attempts in the versions to avoid unflattering references to the sons of Eli (1 Sam 2:17) and King David (2 Sam 5:8, 20:16, 25:22). The MT of 1 Sam 2:17 appears to gloss Eli's young sons (lit. "lads," Dr'19) euphemistically by adding "the men" (D'VX;)' where the LXX and 4QSama have nothing. The recensions of 2 Sam 5:8 attest to efforts to remove the grammatical difficulty and apparent mention of David hating the lame and blind. The variants of 2 Sam 20:16 and 25:22 in the versions avoid an ap- parent rebuke of David by rewording, "the enemies of David." Schorch's second diachronic investigation adopts a compara- tive look at proposed euphemisms in the MT and Samaritan Pentateuch (SP). He again organizes the evidence thematically. Thus, the first category (i.e., those euphemisms that avoid un- comfortable references to Yahweh) includes the SP's use of "ark" (ITpN) in Exod 23:17, 34:23, where the MT has "the Lord" (p1t1W). Under the rubric "Polytheismus," Schorch groups the SP's use of the singular verbs in reference to God, where the MT has plurals (e.g., Gen 20:13, 31:53, 35:7, Exod 22:8, 22:19, Deut 10:17). His third category, "Tod und Krankheit," includes all verses that "soften" references to death and dis- ease (e.g., Exod 21:20, 21:21, 21:28-36, Num 22:33, 35:25, Lev 13:32, Deut 23:18). His final category in this section con- tains variants in the MT and SP which reflect euphemistic ref- erences to sexual activity (i.e., Deut 23:12, 25:11, 28:30). Schorch's third diachronic examination is a text-critical com- parison between the euphemistic hand of the Deuteronomist (in Samuel and Kings) and parallel passages in Chronicles. He again classifies the euphemisms according to their semantic groupings. His categories include the ways in which the Chronicler alters references to death (e.g., 1o;7 ["go"] for =V ["lie down"], and 5M ["fall"] for n1n ["die"]), and the ways in which foreign gods and idols are referenced. Schorch also compares Chronicles and the Deuteronomist for their referen- ces to Yahweh and his titles, especially "Lord Yahweh" ('31K W1;7V). Under the category "Temple," Schorch turns his atten- tion to an apparent unpropitious reference to Yahweh's Temple. Specifically, he compares 1 Kgs 9:8, in which we read "and this house (Temple) will be exalted," with 2 Chron 7:21, "and this house (Temple) once exalted." He then raises the issue of the Targum and other witnesses' rendering of the verse as "and this house (Temple) will become a ruin." This section also con- tains discussions of euphemistic references to body parts like loins and buttocks (e.g., 2 Sam 7:12/1 Chron 17:11, 2 Sam 10:4/1 Chron 19:4). Schorch concludes this section by com- paring the Chronicler's use of "lift up" (mV3) in 1 Chron 10:9 for "cut off" (nob) in 1 Sam 31:9, used in reference to the dis- patching of Saul's head. As Schorch's diachronic data demonstrate, the Bible's eu- phemisms appear in many forms and in a variety of contexts. They are not restricted to a single redactional layer or textual witness and there is no consistency in the types of euphemisms found in the particular redactions (such as Chronicles) or in the translations. Thus, some euphemisms appear in the LXX and not in the MT. Others occur in the MT and not LXX, or just in 4QSama, and so on. While in some cases this may rep- resent the divergent and complex histories of manuscript tra- ditions, it is likely that it also indexes a general tendency for scribes, in every period of the Bible's textual history, to update its language by way of euphemisms. Following this series of diachronic studies is the central fea- ture of the book: viz., a comprehensive lexicon of euphemisms found throughout the Hebrew Bible. Schorch has made the lexicon exceptionally useful by providing it with a system of cross-references that serve to connect it to all the other sec- tions of the book. Here again the treatment is exhaustive and even includes cognate information from Akkadian and Ara- maic where relevant. Having completed his diachronic studies and supplied the reader with a complete data set in the lexicon, Schorch then provides a synchronic analysis of the data by establishing with greater precision the various semantic fields of all biblical eu- phemisms. Each of these broad categories is then subdivided into smaller fields of usage. Thus, the first category "Tot" is di- vided into the following six groups: the process of dying, the deceased, the day of death, the grave, the realm of the dead, and the corpse itself. The first of these groups is then sub- divided further into "death as absence" (e.g., references to "being no more," "going" and "coming," "descending," "being</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books 609 gathered," "carried off," or "taken," etc.); the realm of the dead as a place of gathering; death as a permanent end; God as the Lord of Life (e.g., God as "gatherer," "taker," "one who ends life"); and death as sleep and repose. Schorch's other semantic categories for euphemisms in- clude: disease, bodily defects, cursing, sexual violation, sexual practices of men and animals, sexual bodily functions, and words related to digestive processes. These too are subdivided according to semantic usage and range. In a series of appendices Schorch also covers the substitu- tion of God's name from a diachronic perspective, the Bible's terms for idols, and its erotic vocabulary. The latter excursus allows Schorch to return to the literary aspects of euphemisms in greater detail. Thus, he compares euphemisms to a number of stylistic devices including metaphors (e.g., sex as food and gardens), antiphrasis, litotes, foreign words as substitutes for more common ones, metonymy, periphrasis, synecdoche, ellip- sis, wish formulae, and folk etymologies. The book concludes with a useful bibliography and a number of indices. In sum, this book is a valuable resource and model. Schorch has elucidated a complex topic in the light of new research, while laying firm groundwork for future comparative work. One can imagine, for example, applying much of Schorch's methodology to the study of euphemism in other ancient Near Eastern languages and to investigations into a variety of poten- tially related topics such as word play, atbash, and the lan- guage of "magic," to name just a few.
