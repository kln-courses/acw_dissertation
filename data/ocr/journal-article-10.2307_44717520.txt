Chandler Civil Aeromedicai Institute, Federal Aviation Administration THE DESIGNER of a "crashworthy" general aviation aircraft cabin is faced with the fundamental problem of evaluating the effectiveness of his design before it is released for production and sale to the public. Experiences in the automotive indus- try have repeatedly indicated that dynamic testing is essential for realistic evaluation of automotive restraint systems, seating systems, and interior protection concepts. Similar tests, prop- erly designed and conducted, will provide the designer of gen- eral aviation aircraft with data that are essential to the success- ful evaluation of his design. Three factors enter into a dynamic test program: 1. Test requirement definition. 2. Test conduct. 3. Interpretation of results. Each of these factors must be properly accomplished, since a failure in any one could invalidate the entire program. NOTE: The techniques discussed in this paper are currently used in research being conducted by the Protection and Sur- vival Laboratory of the FAA Civil Aeromedicai Institute. No regulatory intent or application is implied. These techniques are currently under development and will be varied as ad- vances in the state-of-the-art permit. The contents do not nec- essarily reflect the official views or policy of the FAA. This document does not constitute a standard, specification, or regulation. DEFINITION OF TEST CRITERIA A major fault of much dynamic crash testing is that inade- quate consideration has been given to the determination of the test requirements. Both the anticipated crash environ- ment and the anticipated weak points of the crashworthiness design are elements of the test requirements. The dynamic crash tests should expose design or fabrication faults within the anticipated crash environment of the aircraft. This re- quires a selection of test conditions which are severe enough to stress the seat, restraint, and interior protection concept in a representative manner, and yet not so severe as to indicate a crashworthiness system which could compromise the air- worthiness of the aircraft. The process of selecting the test environment is aided by a knowledge of the aircraft perfor- mance characteristics and past crash experiences of similar aircraft. In this respect, the designer of a specific aircraft sys- tem has an advantage over the author of general specifications for all aircraft of a certain type. The former can select a par- ticular test environment to determine the unknowns of his de- sign, while the latter must determine a compromise environ- ment which will be of more limited use for a greater variety of designs. Nevertheless, it is interesting to compare the re- sults of two attempts at estimating a general crash environ- ment. ABSTRACT - Increased concern regarding occupant protection for aircraft crashes has expanded efforts toward development of crash- worthy aircraft systems. The purpose of a crashworthy seat, restraint, or interior design is to reduce the probability and severity of injury to the occupant during a crash. In order to evaluate the performance of those systems before they are placed into production, the designer should consider the value of proper dynamic testing. The results of dynamic test should indicate the likelihood of injury to the aircraft occupant. However, test results can be greatly influenced by test tech- niques. This paper presents current approaches to evaluating dynamic test results in terms of likelihood of injury to the human occupant, discusses the limitations and background of those approaches, and presents technical considerations for selection and use of anthropomorphic dummies, test conduct, etc. 1031</page><page sequence="2">1032 R.

Average decelerations are shown (from Hasbrook, Ref. 1) Hasbrook (1)* made a theoretical analysis of a low-speed stall crash based upon simple assumptions of aircraft perfor- mance and crash conditions. He concluded that the crash de- celeration vector would be between 18.5 and 47.5 deg below the longitudinal axis of the aircraft and the average (square wave) deceleration ranged from 48.3 g to 34.8 g in magnitude (Fig. 1). USAAMRDL (2) concluded from their extensive evaluation of survivable rotary and light, fixed-wing aircraft crashes that the differences in crash environment between the two types ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. of aircraft were small in the longitudinal (roll axis) and verti- cal (yaw axis) directions (Figs. 2 and 3). On the basis of this study, USAAMRDL also concluded that two dynamic tests would give a reasonable test environment for U.S. Army cock- pit seats (Fig. 4). It should be noted that Test 1 was designed to be conducted on a drop tower rather than a sled so that the effective movement of the occupant is down and forward, just as happens in a crash. Test 2 was designed as a sled test to evaluate lateral restraint capability. In comparing the results of these two analyses, it is neces- sary to relate the crash vectors calculated by Hasbrook to the probability curves given by USAAMRDL. Table 1 shows this comparison. It is apparent that the difference of the crash vector orientation is due to a more stringent requirement along the longitudinal aircraft axis in Hasbrook's analysis, rather than a less severe requirement along the vertical axis. One other source of data useful in estimating crash decelera- tions is measurements taken in controlled aircraft crashes. Until recently no such data were available on current general aviation aircraft, but work done by Bloedel (3) and planned by others will aid in rectifying this situation. These data must be used with caution, however, since they are the result of a "contrived" crash and may not be any more representative of true field crash environments than are estimates based on theoretical considerations or crash investigation. One conclusion is common to both reports previously dis- cussed. Recognition is given the fact that aircraft crashes gen- erate simultaneous vertical and horizontal loads and testing should reproduce this condition. This is readily obtained on a test sled or drop tower simply by orienting the test section at the appropriate angles relative to the deceleration vector provided by the test facility. The angular orientation of the test section, of course, depends on the relative magnitude of the vertical horizontal, and lateral deceleration components</page><page sequence="3">CRASHWORTHINESS: TEST DATA EVALUATION 1033 100. 11111 J_ »I H 90 u /ly - O. - I 80 w Af S 70 UH ^ i S .JjĻ 70 UH IŒ ^ ; „_Z 3f g 40 ļ - ^ 1 ; g ,qz 40 ļ - ^ LJ ^ ^ zn ^ 5 l&gt; ,0 Jļ I - - - Rotary-Wing ^ LJ Aircraft ^ ^ l&gt; I - - - Rotary-Wing Aircraft £ Light Fixed-Wing Aircraft o io 1 j °0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 AVERAGE LONGITUDINAL ACCELERATION - G ^ Fig. 3 - Cumulative frequency of ac- celeration components parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft (from USAAMRDL TR 71-22, Ref. 2) Fig. 4 - Dynamic test requirements for U.S. Army aircraft seats based on 95th percentile pulses (from USAAMRDL 71-22, Ref. 2) which are desired. Simultaneous action of all components is essential to a meaningful test since the gross nonlinearities and complex interreactions of the occupant and the seat- restraint-interior system preclude straightforward interpreta- tion of a composite of data obtained one axis at a time.

Consider a test plan for an energy-absorbing seat for vertical loads which calls for two sequential tests of the seat, the first providing vertical loading and the second providing longitudinal loading. The seat could show proper energy absorption in the vertical im- pact test, where the occupant remained in position against the back rest as shown in Fig. 5 A. The system could also per- form properly, without energy absorption, in the longitudinal impact test since the loading would be taken primarily by the restraint system, as shown in Fig. 5B, and only a small com- ponent of load is reacted by the seat. However, these tests give no information relating to the performance of the system under combined vertical and longitudinal loading, as occurs in a crash. Fig. 5C shows a possible unfortunate outcome of the crash. The occupant moves forward under the action of the longitudinal deceleration, while simultaneously applying a downward load due to the vertical component of deceleration. This may cause the load to be carried largely by the forward legs of the seat with overstroke and potential failure of these legs, resulting in forward deflection of the seat and submarin- ing of the occupant causing serious internal injuries. Yet this</page><page sequence="4">1034 R. F. CHANDLER a / b « Fig. 5 - Crashworthy seating arrangement incorporating energy-ab- sorbing seat, impact protective glare shield, and combined lap belt and shoulder restraint. The results of a vertical impact test are shown at a. The occupant's torso remains against seat back, distributing load be- tween front and rear seat legs which collapse evenly, limiting crash loads on occupant and on cabin floor. Note that lap belt becomes slack, reducing its effectiveness in event of a secondary crash pulse. Results of a horizontal impact test are shown at b. Occupant moves forward producing loads in restraint system. As occupant's torso and neck flex, head contacts glare shield which deforms to absorb energy of impact without pilot injury. Since only minimal loads are trans- ferred to seat, no energy absorption is effected. Results of combined vertical and horizontal loading, as could occur in a crash, are shown in c. Occupant's torso moves forward and down. Down load is trans- ferred primarily to front leg of seat, which collapses as it absorbs en- ergy. Rear seat leg, under relatively light load, does not collapse. This allows seat to tilt forward. Shoulder restraint is attached to lap belt and pulls lap belt over pelvis as seat collapses. Pelvis rolls under seat belt (submarines), knees impact instrument panel, and head moves below glare shield to contact control wheel and instrument panel. All these actions can produce serious injury or death, but cannot be eval- uated from results of vertical or horizontal impact tests shown at a and b problem could be hidden by the improper selection of the test conditions. An additional concern should be the occurrence of multiple impacts in a crash. Cost and facility limitations usually pro- hibit controlled multiple impact tests, with reorientation of the test section between impacts. Careful evaluation of the results of single impact data should be made to assure that the seating and restraint systems remain functional for any sub- sequent impact. The design characteristics of the seat, restraint, and interior system will also influence determination of the test require- ments. The designer should show ingenuity in selecting poten- tial problems for experimental investigation. It is not possible to describe all design innovations, so an example must suffice to illustrate this concern. Consider a typical installation of an upper torso restraint system which incorporates a webbing- sensitive inertia reel. These reels lock when the acceleration of the strap relative to the reel exceeds a prescribed limit. The designer may choose a "2 g" lockup, indicating that the rela- tive acceleration between the occupant (shoulder strap) and the reel must exceed 2 g for the reel to lock. While the de- signer will undoubtedly recognize the necessity of testing his system at high impact levels, he should also recognize that conditions exist where the upper torso restraint will not func- tion. If, for example, a crash takes place at 6 g and the occu- pant is able to "effectively provide" 4 g of muscular restraint, as seen at the shoulder strap, then the relative acceleration be- tween the occupant and the aircraft would be 2 g and the in- ertia reel may not lock. The occupant could continue motion toward the instrument panel at 2 g acceleration, generating sufficient velocity at head contact to cause serious injury or death. In this case, it would be appropriate to also conduct a test of the interior padding at conditions simulating the reel lockup limit. The designer should also remember that elonga- tions or deflections in the seating and restraint system, due to stress or slack in the various components, and deformation of the body of the occupant will allow gross movement of the occupant from the normal seated position, permitting a pos- sible secondary impact with the aircraft interior. TEST CONDUCT After the criteria for a test series have been established, the task of conducting the tests begins. Again, several decisions must be made which affect the validity of the test results. Among these are: 1. Selection, adjustment and use of a suitable anthropo- metric dummy. 2. Selection and use of the data system. 3. Selection of an appropriate test method. A review of the sales brochures of the manufacturers of an- thropometric dummies shows the availability of a wide variety of dummies. Everything from "4-year-old child" simulators, through "5 percentile" females, to "95 percentile" male dum- mies of varying sophistication, complication, and expense are available. The percentile designations used to describe dummy size are nominal rather than exact, since each dummy is com- posed of a multitude of dimensions, each of which may be important in determining some element of its performance. The "95th percentile" dummy cannot be composed of parts each of which, statistically, represents the equivalent 95th percentile measurement in our population, for the aggregate of those parts would be greatly excessive. The 95th percentile dummy merely represents a "big man" whose individual di- mensions were judged appropriate for a dummy which is per- haps 95th percentile in height and weight. It is important for the designer to recognize that successful test results with a 95th percentile dummy do not indicate that the aircraft sys- tem will perform properly for 95% of the population, because some systems, such as energy-absorbing seating or restraint systems, are extremely critical relative to occupant weight. On the contrary, good performance with one occupant weight may well be coincident with fatal results to an occupant of different weight. It is essential that these systems be tested with a wide range of occupant size if their performance is to</page><page sequence="5">CRASHWORTHINESS : TEST DATA EVALUATION 1 035 be completely understood. This implies that the testing ac- tivity should be equipped with at least 5th percentile (small) female dummies, as well as 50th percentile (average) male and 95th percentile (large) male dummies, if the aircraft is to be used by the general population. With such a variety of simulators available, it would appear that the problem should be one of selecting the best from a group of adequate devices. Unfortunately, the problem is closer to that of selecting the marginally satisfactory unit from a group of inadequate choices. The current dummies most suitable for use in general aviation crash testing are those de- signed for automotive crash testing and are built to meet the requirements of SAE J963 (4). Dummies built to other speci- fications represent special purpose devices which should be used only if needed and if their limitations are understood. SAE J963 is an incomplete specification inasmuch as many critical requirements such as moments of inertia of the dummy segments, joint friction limits, dynamic response, manufac- turing tolerances, etc., are not included. Work is currently under way in the SAE Dummy Subcommittee to establish these additional requirements. Recently, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (5) issued procure- ment specifications for dummies which they will use in their automobile compliance test program. These dummies have not yet been fabricated or tested, so their usefulness for gen- eral aviation testing cannot be stated. It is unlikely that two differing specifications would coexist in automobile impact testing, so convergence of the SAE and NHTSA specifications will undoubtedly take place in the future. The cause for confusion relative to dummy design and fab- rication is that well-defined, generally accepted dummy re- quirements are not available. The basic purpose of the dummy is to perform as a human substitute and thus demonstrate kinematics and injury potential representative of the human occupant. Unfortunately, human kinematics and impact injury tolerances are difficult to measure and many early at- tempts at these measurements generated data which are diffi- cult to interpret on an engineering basis. The problem is com- pounded by the fact that the human is a "nonlinear" system so that measurements made on human volunteers at safe levels are not necessarily predictive of their reactions at higher levels. Thus, much of the tolerance limit work has been done with animal subjects or human cadavers with attendant difficulties in projecting the results to living human tolerance. Finally, the relationships of measurements made on a biological sys- tem to measurements made on an anthropometric dummy are not fully defined. Nevertheless, an impact test with a suitable anthropometric dummy, properly used and properly instrumented, permits the closest possible simulation of a crash. In using the dummy, attention must be given to adjustments possible within the dummy structure and to careful and realistic placement of the dummy in the test vehicle. Although many techniques have been developed to use dummies in impact testing, no published guidelines are generally available and practices differ among the various users. The usual 1 g adjustment of arms and legs simply means that the limb, or limb segment joint, is tightened until the segment will just barely move under its own weight. These adjustments have been made easier by recent improve- ments in joint design of some dummies which give smoother, more continuous motion. The 1 g criteria is of little use in ad- justing smaller segments, the torso-neck-head linkage, or in torsional movements. Here, judgment is most often used and the adjustment is set at some "reasonable" level between the locked motion setting and the completely loose setting. This lack of precision is of particular concern in adjusting the neck linkage of the dummy, since improper adjustment can generate improper head impact measurements. Extensive treatment of the dummy neck problem has recently been presented by Bow- man (6), Melvin (7), Culver (8), and Haffner (9). The varied designs proposed by these investigators reflect the emphasis currently being placed on improvements in dummy construc- tion. INSTRUMENTATION AND DATA ANALYSIS The instrumentation used during the test is selected to pro- vide data for the engineering design analysis of the crash pro- tection system and for evaluation of the protective qualities of the system. The instrumentation for engineering analysis is common to other tests and need not be reviewed here. In- strumentation for evaluating the protection offered by the system, and the analysis of data obtained from that instru- mentation, are closely related and should be considered to- gether. Snyder (10) presented a state-of-the-art survey of biome- chanical aspects of impact injury tolerance which is an excel- lent guideline for aircraft cabin design. Although these data are useful as design limits, they are difficult to confirm during dynamic test. Practical limitations in the type and quantity of measurements which can be made dictate the data which are available for analysis and interpretation. For example, a time history of load distribution over the occupant's body would be a very useful injury indicator, but such measure- ments are not possible with current techniques. Instead, most measurements are limited to point accelerations within the dummy, to load cell measurements, or deflection measure- ments which are interpretable as injury predictors. SECONDARY HEAD IMPACTS Perhaps the most important injury measurement is that due to secondary impact of the occupant's head with internal cabin structure. The high frequency of these injuries in actual crashes resulted in early recognition of the importance of preventing these injuries. Recent studies are providing analytical tech- niques for interpreting instrumentation data in terms of head injury. In a dynamic test, where the site of impact in the cabin cannot reasonably be instrumented, triaxial accelerom- eters mounted near the e.g. of the head often serve to indicate injury. Swearingen (11) found that facial bone fracture varied from 30 to 100 g, but gave no analytical technique for evalua- ting time effects. One of the first accepted attempts to ac- complish this resulted in the "severity index" (S.I. or HSI)</page><page sequence="6">1036 R. F. CHANDLER proposed by Gadd (12) which was developed by SAE into an information report (13). The severity index is an analytical technique which attempts to relate head acceleration time data to an early tolerance curve developed by Wayne State Univer- sity (14) by "curve matching" techniques. It is applicable to head rather than face impact. Difficulties in consistent appli- cation of the severity index led to a critique of this method by Versace (15) and his recommendation of the "tolerance limit" (TL). The tolerance limit attempted to resolve analytical weak- nesses in the derivation of the severity index, but the author recognized the trend toward dynamic modeling techniques as an alternative to the curve-fitting method. Nevertheless, the Versace "tolerance limit" predated the similar "head injury criterion" (HIC) proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for evaluation of secondary impact head injury (16). The growing popularity of dynamic modeling techniques has led to a number of dynamic spring-mass models as an aid to interpreting head impact acceleration measurements. Essen- tially these models consist of a parallel spring and damper supporting a mass, each with specified characteristics. The acceleration time data measured on the dummy are used as input to excite the dynamic system. The elongation of the spring resulting from the excitation is used as an indication of injury. Kornhauser (17) and Payne (18) were early propo- nents of applying this technique to prediction of biological system impact tolerance. Among the various models in use are the effective displacement index (EDI) of Brinn and Staffeld (19), the J. tolerance index of Slattenschech (20), the revised brain model of Fan (21), and the maximum strain criteria (MSG) of Stalnaker and McElhaney (22). The MSC model (Fig. 6) has had extensive experimental and analytical back- ground and has been applied to lateral (23) as well as frontal head impact. HEAD AND NECK INJURY WITHOUT SECONDARY IMPACT Although nonimpact head injury or cervical spine injury is not commonly reported in general aviation crashes, it is pos- sible that these injuries may appear as upper torso restraint systems become more used. As upper torso restraints become more effective in preventing head contact with the cabin in- terior, they may also increase head and neck flexion (due to restraint) and extension (due to rebound from restraint), and as fatalities from massive head damage become less frequent, fatalities from the less obvious neck injuries may be more often reported. Extensive work in this field is just beginning, so that tolerance limits have not been established. Gennarelli, Ommaya and Thibault (24) found that rotation of the head is more likely to produce cerebral concussion than translation. Clark, et al. (25) reported high head angular accelerations, averaging 45,700 deg/s on ten human subjects restrained by a lap belt and impacted at 9.4 g. Ewing (26) is conducting an extensive and precisely documented research program in which he is currently investigating this problem.

CHEST IMPACT - Chest injury is often due to penetration or localized chest loading from control column or control wheel failures. The designer of the aircraft cabin should make every effort to assure that these components yield without sharp edge fracture. Serious penetrating wounds resulting from such sharp edges can occur at low force levels and are thus particularly difficult to prevent. If the contact surface conforms to the chest and is a reasonably large area (about 30 uĄ, loads of 1200-1400 lb may be withstood. There is no general consensus that acceleration is a proper indicator of chest injury, yet this measurement is commonly made in dum- mies during impact tests. Evaluation of chest accelerometer data has been hampered by the complexity of the injury mech- anisms relating to the thorax and internal organs. MVSS 208, Occupant Crash Protection, previously limited accelera- tion to not more than 60 g for more than 3 ms, but currently states that a severity index of 1000 is to be used in defining injury. Brinn (27) proposed adapting the EDI technique for evaluating chest injury and presented preliminary data to illus- trate the suitability of the method. SPINAL IMPACT - Lumbar spine injury is a common in- jury in general aviation crashes. Considerable research has been carried out to determine the biomechanical properties of the spinal column, but these data have not yet been applied to determining a tolerance limit for the combined loading con- ditions in general aviation crashes. Mil-S-9479A (28) provides a "dynamic response index" (DRI) useful in military aircraft with ejection system testing which interprets seat pan accelera- tion measurements in three dimensions as an indicator of spinal injury, but this technique is based upon the assumption that the body is maintained in an upright seated position. This same technique has, however, been used for the analysis</page><page sequence="7">CRASHWORTHINESS: TEST DATA EVALUATION 1 037 of energy-absorbing seating systems in a nonejection aircraft seat (29), but again with the assumption that the torso re- mains seated upright. This problem is further complicated by the fact that the dummies most suitable for general aviation crash testing have been developed primarily for automotive use, where dynamic representation of the human in the vertical direction has not been considered important. Thus the possibility exists of im- proper dummy response in the vertical direction yielding inac- curate data in some impact situations. Although dummies have been fabricated which are designed to provide some de- gree of simulation of human response in the vertical direction (30), these devices have other limitations which make their use for general aviation system tests unsatisfactory. Acceler- ometers located at the pelvis are commonly used test instru- ments. Data from these transducers can be applied to the computation of a DRI if seat pan acceleration is not measured. Careful examination of these data may also reveal sharp dips in acceleration or show rotation of the pelvis, either of which indicates potential submarining problems. ABDOMINAL INJURY - The potential for serious injury in the abdominal area has been reduced through the common use of lap belts in general aviation aircraft. Increased appli- cation of upper torso restraints may cause an increase in this type of injury if the potential for "submarining" is not recog- nized and designed out of the system. Shoulder straps which attach to the lap belt may transmit load to the lap belt in such a manner that the lap belt tends to be pulled over the pelvis into the soft abdominal tissue. This can cause internal abdomi- nal injuries which are difficult to clinically diagnose and which are threatening to life. The likelihood of this occurrence is greater in the general aviation crash than in the automotive crash because the impact direction increases the tendency of the pelvis to slip under the belt. Much early testing, using prim- itive dummies with horizontal impact directions, is of ques- tionable value in evaluating the tendency of a restraint sys- tem to induce submarining. These simple dummies do not have pelvic simulations, so it is impossible to evaluate slippage of the belt from the pelvis. On the contrary, many dummies are constructed with a mechanical hinge in place of the pelvis, and this hinge tends to capture the lap belt so that cutting the belt by the hinge is a common failure. To evaluate submarin- ing phenomena, a dummy with adequate pelvic simulation is essential, and it must be adjusted so that spinal flexure is still possible. A rigid spine restricts pelvic rotation and reduces the indication of submarining in a test. Evaluation of data to determine the occurrence of subma- rining is often difficult. Very often the space within the cabin is so limited that knee contact with the instrument panel takes place coincident with submarining and prevents the gross mo- tion which might otherwise occur. High-speed motion picture coverage will occasionally show the movement of the lap belt over the pelvis, but cameras must be located to look for this event, and film must be carefully evaluated. Data from belt load transducers or pelvic accelerometers often reflect the occurrence of submarining as a "notch" or "valley" in this data trace, as shown in Fig. 7. Finally, careful post -test in- Fig. 7 - Indication of submarining from data record. Notch shown at a often occurs in pelvic acceleration or lap belt load data as belt moves over pelvic simulation into abdomen. Knee contact with instrument panel can produce a similar artifact in belt load measurements spection of the test configuration may show the position of the lap belt above the pelvis, unusual forward motion of the pelvis, or unusual rotation of the pelvis. In conducting these tests, efforts should be made to provide a realistic test configuration. Dummies must be dressed in an appropriate manner, such as with cotton twill clothing. Elim- ination of clothing may make easier interpretation of film data possible, but the higher friction present between the dummy flesh and the seat cover may prevent the motion which would normally occur. Special attention should be given to the installation of the restraint system so that it will represent typical usage. A common error in this respect is the action of the over-enthusiastic technician who tightens the lap belt far beyond reason. Unfortunately, most occupants wear the re- straint slack, so that a barely snug installation on the test dummy is all that should be provided. Seat position can af- fect the tendency to submarine if the lap belt is attached to the airframe in a fixed location. As the seat is moved rear- ward, the lap belt angle increases, reducing the tendency to submarine, but allowing greater forward motion of the occu- pant for possible injury from the instrument panel (31). LOWER EXTREMITY IMPACT - Leg injury is frequent in general aviation crashes, but seldom results in fatal conse- quences unless rapid evacuation of the aircraft is essential for survival. Fracture of the ankle and lower leg results from cabin intrusion or flailing impact with the cabin interior. There is no technique for instrumenting dummies to indicate this in- jury mechanism at present. Careful evaluation of dummy motion during the impact and careful post-test inspection of the cabin will often indicate potential injury-producing con- ditions. Upper leg injury can result from contact with the instrument panel. If the contact surface between the knee and the instru- ment panel is padded so as to distribute the load, Patrick (32) concluded that 1400 lb was a reasonable skeletal fracture threshold. Although consideration is being given to increasing the tolerance level to 1700 lb, the occurrence of traumatic arthritis, as reported by States (33), indicates that major med- ical problems can occur without obvious skeletal injury so that the lower limit is beneficial. If the knee contacts small, rigid protrusions, such as switches or knobs, Melvin (34) found skeletal damage as low as 560 lb.</page><page sequence="8">1038 R. F.

Fig. 8 - Minimum analysis for evaluation of electronic instrumentation data gathered in crashworthiness tests In newer dummies designed for automobile impact testing, provision is made for the insertion of a load cell just above the knee so that knee impact loads can be measured. Although some artifact is introduced by the location of the load cell (above the knee rather than at the knee), this measurement represents the best available method for indicating possible injuries. RESTRAINT SYSTEM LOADS - Although loads measured in the restraint system are not yet interpreted as injury indi- cators, it is well to note that tests using human volunteers at subjectively tolerable impact levels have generated significant loads without producing injury to the subject. Lewis and Stapp (35) reported impacts of up to 30 g in tests using lap belts which generated almost 4300 lbf. Chandler (36) and Armstrong and Waters (37) recorded loads of 1600 lb for the single diagonal upper torso restraint, and 1900 lb lap belt loads in human testing at low levels. These measurements are usually made with a load cell through which the belt is passed and which converts strap ten- sion to bending in the transducer which is measured by strain gages. Because of the nature of the transducer, care must be taken to assure that the transducer is not in a position where bending will take place from other causes, such as being bent over structure or the dummy rather than by tension from the belt. Also, since these transducers possess considerable weight, their use on long, unsupported lengths of belt can cause data artifact due to belt sag. When used under these conditions, the weight of the transducer must be supported by breakaway tape or thread. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Properly conducted, dynamic testing provides a valuable tool for the aircraft designer to evaluate the effectiveness of crash injury protective equipment. Although techniques for evalu- ating injury potential from impact test data are currently in a state of development, it is possible to define a tentative sys- tem for making these evaluations. Fig. 8 indicates one pos- sible arrangement which would provide useful injury evalua- tion data from impact data. REFERENCES 1 . A. H.
