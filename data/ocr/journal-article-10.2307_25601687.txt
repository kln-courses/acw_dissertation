<plain_text><page sequence="1">CIAN DUFFY "The Child of a Fierce Hour": Shelley and Napoleon Bonaparte IN SHELLEY! THE PURSUIT, RICHARD HOLMES DISCUSSES A "DIFFICULT" August 1815 letter from Percy Shelley to his friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg.1 Holmes finds this letter "difficult" because Shelley's remarks on the "final denouement of the Napoleonic struggle in Europe" appear to him to be "distanced to the point of indifference" (290). Shelley's letter refers to newspaper reports describing the "continuance" of Allied "enormities" in post-Restoration France, and then goes on to say that: In considering the political events of the day I endeavour to divest my mind of temporary sensations, to consider them as already historical. This is difficult. Spite of ourselves the human beings which surround us infect us with their opinions; so much as to forbid us to be dispas sionate observers of the questions arising out of the events of the age.2 Holmes's seminal challenge to the Arnoldian and New Critical view of Shelley evidently influences his reading of this passage. Even so, it is not immediately obvious why it should be "difficult to believe that these were the words of a political radical aged 23" (290). Rather, Shelley's concern to remain a "dispassionate observer" of "political events," and attendant anxi ety about intellectually "infectious" public opinion, is entirely consistent with the Godwinian mainstream of his political thought.3 What really is "extraordinary" about this letter, however, is the fact that i.

This is not, of course, to suggest that Napoleon does not feature in Shelley's work. Conversely, he clearly plays an important role in The Triumph of Life (1822), and is the subject of three shorter poems: "To the Emperors of Russia and Austria . . ." (1810), "Feelings of a Republican on the Fall of Bonaparte" (1815), and "Lines written on hearing the News of the Death of Napoleon" (1821).4 He also appears in passing in Shelley's "Ode to Liberty" (1820), and Philosophical View of Reform (1819), and is at least implicitly present in the "Lines Written Among the Euganean Hills" (1818). However, very lit tle scholarly attention has been paid to Shelley's engagement with Napo leon and there is, I think, a critical perception that he didn't have a great deal to say on the subject, at least not when compared to contemporaries like Wordsworth, Southey, Hazlitt, and Byron. Tellingly, the only full length study of Romanticism's relationship with Napoleon?Simon Bain bridge's Napoleon and English Romanticism (1995)?makes virtually no men tion of Shelley. Seeking to redress this lack of critical attention, the present piece identifies an engagement with Napoleon Bonaparte as a sustained and im portant feature of Shelley's work. Intensely concerned with understanding the disastrous course of the French Revolution?"the master theme of the epoch in which we live"?Shelley's political thought needed, necessarily, to take account of Bonaparte (Letters 1: 504). In Napoleon and English Ro manticism, Simon Bainbridge traces a broad pattern of disillusionment and concern in Britain as the erstwhile defender of the French Revolution against foreign aggression becomes an Imperial aggressor himself. Napo leon, as Bainbridge demonstrates, provided early nineteenth-century Brit ish culture with an obvious and potent focus for libertarian disenchant ment, conservative reaction, and cross-party national(ist) anxiety. Writers like Wordsworth and Coleridge, Bainbridge suggests, drawing on now familiar arguments about Romanticism's relationship with history, sought to define their own poetic role in opposition to Napoleon's increasingly expansionist politics. Conversely, writers on the other side of the political divide?Byron and Hazlitt in particular?continued not only to valorize Napoleon in order to attack the increasingly conservative establishment, 4.

Byron's self styled role as the "grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme" is only the best-known example of this strategy (Donfuan xi: 400). What Bainbridge's excellent study makes clear, then, is not only that Napoleon played an im portant role in the self-conception and self-presentation of some of English Romanticism's foremost literary proponents, but also that their engage ment with Bonaparte fed directly into "one of the crucial Romantic de bates?the relationship of poetical to political power."5 Napoleon, Bain bridge affirms, "was critical to the cultural politics and poetics of the Romantic period" (16). Percy Shelley was obviously a key player in this "crucial Romantic de bate," and I will argue that his engagement with Napoleon Bonaparte equally foregrounds questions about the "relationship of poetical to politi cal power." Napoleon emerges from Shelley's work as both a cause and a consequence of the French Revolution's authoritarian collapse, as?to adapt the definition of poets and philosophers in the "Preface" to Prome theus Unbound (1819)?"in one sense, the creator . . . and, in another, the creation . . . of [his] age" (Poems 2: 474?75). It is important to recognize, however, that this overlap between Shelley's account of Bonaparte and his developing concept of the legislator-Poet is neither fortuitous nor simply the product of an underlying theory of historical causation. Rather Shelley increasingly came to understand?and, moreover, to represent?Napoleon precisely in terms of his nascent ideas about the historical agency of the imagination. Remarkable as it may seem, the Napoleon of The Triumph of Life can be understood?in the terms of Shelley's approximately contem porary Defence of Poetry (1821)?as a failed poet. My argument, then, is not simply that Shelley's work participates in contemporary debate about Na poleon, but also that this participation was inextricably bound up with Shelley's growing understanding of the historical and political potency of the imagination. In a 27 December 1812 letter to Hogg, Shelley affirmed that he sympa thized with his friend's "feelings on Buonaparte ... a personage to whom I have a very great objection" (Letters 1: 345). "He is to me a hateful &amp; de spicable being," Shelley continues: "he is seduced by the grossest &amp; most vulgar ambition into actions which only differ from those of pirates by vir tue of the number of men &amp; the variety of resources under his command" (345-46). Despite this blunt dismissal, however, which was doubtless writ 5. Simon Bainbridge, Napoleon and English Romanticism (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995) 3</page><page sequence="4">402 CIAN DUFFY ten in part for Hogg's benefit, Shelley's wider engagement with Napoleon broadly conforms to the pattern of Radical disillusionment described by Bainbridge. "Feelings of a Republican on the Fall of Bonaparte" illustrates the extent of this conformity well enough. First published in Shelley's 1816 Alastor volume, "Feelings of a Republican ..." was almost certainly com posed, as Matthews and Everest suggest, after the Treaty of the Holy Alli ance in September 1815 (Poems 1: 455). The title places Shelley's poem firmly in a tradition of pseudo-confessional explorations of the French Revolution's authoritarian collapse: Wordsworth's "Thought of a Briton on the Subjugation of Switzerland" (1807) and Coleridge's France: an Ode (1798) are two important generic precursors here. Much more obviously important, of course, is the extensive, multi-generic representation of Na poleon in contemporary British culture.6 Shelley's titular concept of a "Fall" invokes one of the key tropes of that representation: the figuring of Napoleon as Biblical or Miltonic Satan, or as Promethean over-reacher. Byron's 1814 Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte, which Shelley knew, is a promi nent literary example of this figure.7 And while "Feelings of a Republican ..." predictably avoids the quasi-valorized, defiant Prometheanism of By ron's "Ode," Shelley certainly does present the "fallen tyrant" as a mis guided over-reacher (i).8 More precisely, "Feelings of a Republican ..." opens by ironically identifying the "hated" Napoleon as "a most unambi tious slave," "unambitious" not because Napoleon lacked ambition, but because his ambition was misconceived (1, 2). "Thou mightst have built thy throne / Where it had stood even now," Shelley affirms: "thou didst prefer / A frail and bloody pomp which time has swept / In fragments towards oblivion" (4?7). Here, then, we have Bainbridge's familiar, Ro mantic condemnation of the First Consul turned Emperor, of the erstwhile defender of the French Revolution who turned to "dance and revel on the grave / of Liberty" (3?4). But Shelley will increasingly come to repre sent this apostasy in terms of the dysfunction, or collapse of the poetic imagination. The "fallen" Napoleon in "Feelings of a Republican . . ."?the "minis ter" of "Treason and Slavery, Rapine, Fear, and Lust"?can be usefully 6. Bainbridge details the "vast . . . scale of material on Napoleon in the period," quoting, by way of example, a study by A. M. Broadley which identifies "an astonishing 999 English [caricatures] between 1795 and 1821" (15). 7. Bainbridge discusses many other examples, one of which deserves mention here: George Cruikshank's 1814 cartoon, The Modem Prometheus, or Downfall of Tyranny, which may well have influenced the subtitle of Mary Shelley's politically-laden account of over reaching revolutionary ambition: Frankenstein, or, The Modem Prometheus (1818). 8. Shelley's fullest rejection of Byron's defiant Prometheanism came, of course, in Prome theus Unbound, a "lyrical drama" from which Napoleon is conspicuously and surprisingly ab sent (Poems 2: 471).</page><page sequence="5">SHELLEY AND NAPOLEON BONAPARTE 403 compared with the "restless fiend" at the center of Shelley's first poetic en gagement with Bonaparte: his lines addressed "To the Emperors of Russia and Austria, who Eyed the Battle of Austerlitz from the Heights whilst Buonaparte was Active in the Thickest of the Fight" ("Feelings of a Re publican . . ." [i, 10]; "To the Emperors . . ." [21]).9 Shelley begins by drawing an apparently flattering contrast between the "Coward Chiefs" of Austria and Russia, who watch the battle unfold from a "distant mountain's brow," and Napoleon who leads from the front on the field below (1, 4).10 "Does one human feeling creep / Through your heart's remorseless sleep?" Shelley asks Alexander and Francis: On that silence cold and deep Does one impulse flow Such as fires the Patriot's breast, Such as breaks the Hero's rest? (5-10) Shelley's answer, of course, is "No" (11). Unlike the "Patriot"/"Hero" Napoleon, who fights alongside his men on the "gory field," Alexander and Francis are detached ("calm and still") from the "groans of those who die" (22, 11, 15). Indeed, their only response to the carnage is to "smile se cure" when "the Yells of Victory / Float o'er the murdered good," an nouncing the apparent defeat of the French by the Russian Imperial Guard (16?19). Their "security" is illusory, however: "On yonder plain," Shelley affirms, referring to Napoleon's decisive personal intervention in the battle, "the game, if lost, begins again" (19-20). The 3rd stanza of "To the Em perors ..." lauds this intervention, praising Napoleon?"Whom neither shame nor danger daunts, / Who dares not fear, who cannot yield"?and confirming that he will "with equalising blow": Abase the high, exalt the low, And in one mighty shock o'erthrow The slaves that sceptres wield, 9. The battle of Austerlitz was fought on the 2nd of December 1805. As Matthews and Everest point out, internal evidence suggests that "To the Emperors ..." was written, with the benefit of considerable historical hindsight, sometime between the Peace of Schonbrunn (between France and Austria) in October 1809 and the resumption of Franco-Russian hostil ities in late 1810. The Emperors in question are Alexander 1 of Russia and Francis 11 of Aus tria, the father of Napoleon's future wife, Maria Louisa. See Poems 1: 138. 10. Matthews and Everest cite the account of Austerlitz in the January 1806 number of the Gentleman's Magazine, which describes Napoleon's personal intervention in the crushing de feat of the Russian Imperial Guard (Poems 1: 139). Though written much later, Shelley may well have drawn on this account?a translation of official French Records?for some of the details of "To the Emperors ..." (see Poems 1: 139).</page><page sequence="6">404 CIAN DUFFY Till from the ruin of the storm Ariseth Freedom's awful form (23-30) Here again, then, is Napoleon the "Patriot" defender of the French Revo lution or, more accurately, the Napoleon favored by English Radicalism, the Napoleon who?to adopt already the loaded terms of Coleridge's France?will "compel the nations to be Free!" (62; my emphasis). The historical moment that Shelley addresses is clearly more complex than such an easy apostrophe would allow, however: after all, the "Patriot" Napoleon was himself an Emperor at Austerlitz, and we should remember that "To the Emperors ..." was written with the benefit of at least 4 years hindsight. Hence while Shelley recognizes that Alexander and Francis can not have slept very well after Austerlitz ("How sleep ye now, unfeeling Kings?"), he confirms that despite their present "terrors," they may ulti mately "rest secure": a return, in effect, to the security they initially experi ence during the battle itself (35, 41). This assurance presumably looks for ward to the temporary cessation of Franco-Russian hostilities at Tilsit in 1807, and to the October 1809 peace of Schonbrunn, which ended the war with Austria. Significantly, however, it also marks a decisive change in the poem's attitude to Napoleon, a change apparently triggered by the shift in narrative perspective from the individual conduct of the emperors at Austerlitz to their ongoing roles in the larger history of the French Revolution. More precisely, Napoleon?who is described, ambivalently enough, as a "restless fiend" in the commendatory 3rd stanza of "To the Emperors . . ."?is, in the final stanza, explicitly identified as a "tyrant" alongside Al exander and Francis (21, 44, 28). And once again, this identification takes place within a shift in narrative perspective from the individual to the his torical. Napoleon may be the victor at Austerlitz, and Alexander and Fran cis consequently his "slaves," but the larger historical relationship between the three "tyrants" is one of equivalence and?moreover?of mutual politi cal dependence: Thou Northern chief why startest thou? Pale Austria, calm those fears. Be sure The tyrant needs such slaves as you. Think ye the world would bear his sway Were dastards such as you away? No! they would pluck his plumage gay Torn from a nation's woe, And lay him in the oblivious gloom Where Freedom now prepares your tomb (42-50)</page><page sequence="7">SHELLEY AND NAPOLEON BONAPARTE 405 "To the Emperors ..." closes, then, with a reformed vision of Napoleon as the betrayer of the French Revolution, of Napoleon the opportunistic "ty rant" who capitalized on France's 1790s "woe." And this vision is again historical rather than ad hominem. The "world" tolerates ("bears") this "das tard" Napoleon because his is the lesser of two evils, the greater evil being the ancien regime represented by Alexander and Francis (although Shelley's rather exaggerated "world," here, can presumably only encompass Napo leon's dwindling support among British and European Radicals). The rela tionship between this Napoleon and the "Freedom" he imposes is demon strably problematic, however, and in the long run, the destiny of all three "tyrants" is equivalent: the "oblivious gloom" of a history which tends to wards "Freedom," the "Freedom" of which the "tyrant" Napoleon is only the current, flawed agent. To begin with, "Feelings of a Republican ..." appears to share Shelley's politically optimistic view of the historical fate of tyrants in "To the Em perors. ..." While the later poem laments Napoleon's betrayal of French Revolutionary "Liberty," it simultaneously affirms that "time" has "swept" his "frail" imperial "pomp" to "oblivion," the same "oblivious gloom," presumably, that awaited the tyrants in "To the Emperors ..." ("Feelings of a Republican ..." [4, 6, 8]). In other words, after Waterloo, Napo leon?the "minister" of "Treason and Slavery, Rapine, Fear, and Lust"? has indeed met the historical fate predicted for tyrants in "To the Em perors. ..." Ultimately, however, "Feelings of a Republican ..." does not, indeed cannot, share the long-term historical and political optimism of Shelley's earlier poem. Written after the Treaty of the Holy Alliance and the restoration of the French monarchy, Shelley's ad hominem condemna tion of Napoleon is forced to address the larger?and, from the point of view of a Republican, dismal?political state of post-Waterloo Europe. Napoleon's personal shortcomings?identified in "Feelings of a Republi can . . ." as an inclination towards "force" and "fraud"?are not in them selves sufficient to explain this historical moment (13). More precisely, Na poleon's "unambitious" usurpation alone cannot account for the collapse of the French Revolution. Supra-individual, historical and cultural pro cesses must also be factored in. "I know," Shelley concludes: Too late, since thou and France are in the dust, That virtue owns a more eternal foe Than force or fraud: old Custom, legal Crime, And bloody Faith the foulest birth of time (10-14) In other words, writing after Waterloo, Shelley "knows" that any potential historical progress towards "Liberty" faces more serious problems than the collapse of individual "virtue" into "force or fraud" exemplified by Napo</page><page sequence="8">406 CIAN DUFFY leon ("too late" presumably acknowledging Shelley's earlier, albeit heavily qualified confidence in Napoleon's historical role as a problematic agent of "Freedom"). Rather, "Feelings of a Republican ..." identifies the real "foe" of such progress as what we would call ideology ("old Custom, legal Crime, / And bloody Faith") or the pressure of cultural conventions, of the intellectual ancien regime, upon individual thought and action, upon the in dividual imagination.11 Far from the essential optimism of "To the Em perors . . . ," then, the closing lines of "Feelings of a Republican ..." pres ent political history as an "eternal" struggle between individual "virtue" and "old Custom," a struggle which Napoleon is now understood to have lost.12 And clearly, Shelley's pointed use of the word "eternal" in line 12 here problematizes any comfortably optimistic, Godwinian teleology, rais ing rather the worrying possibility that political history consists of an ulti mately un-resolvable conflict between "virtue" and "Custom." After all, if "To the Emperors ..." places its political faith in an inevitable historical march towards "Freedom," then "Feelings of a Republican ..." seriously qualifies that faith by identifying the ideological "foe" of "virtue" as itself a "birth of time." Shelley's ongoing engagement with Bonaparte perpetuates this larger, historical and cultural analysis, not simply registering disappointment with Napoleonic apostasy, but rather seeking to understand that apostasy in terms of the surrender of the imagination to "Custom." From around 1814 onwards, Shelley begins to develop the theory of the legislator-poet that informs the Defence of Poetry, with its emphasis on the role of the imagina tion in shaping and reshaping popular cultural assumptions, on the imagi nation as the agent of virtue. Shelley's early thought in this regard is partic ularly concerned with the potential dysfunction of the imagination, a potential signalled in his reading by, for example, Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792).13 Hence Shelley's exploration of the apostate Lakers in his Alastor volume?in "To Wordsworth" and "O! There are Spirits"?links political betrayal directly to the failure of the imagination, to the surrender of the imagination to public opinion or "Custom."14 As we have seen, "Feelings of a Republican . . ."?the 3rd ad 11. We remember Shelley's concern, in his August 1815 letter to Hogg, about the extent to which "the human beings which surround us infect us with their opinions; so much as to forbid us to be dispassionate observers of the questions arising out of the events of the age." 12. "Custom" had been a prime target of Shelley's work since Queen Mab's (1812) first at tacks on its "icy chains" (1: 127). 13. In a passage which clearly anticipates Alastors account of the poet-protagonist's solipsistic dream of the "veiled maid," Wollstonecraft attacks Rousseau's "inflamed" and "debauched" imagination (Alastor 151). Quoted from Mary Wollstonecraft: Political Writings, ed. Janet Todd (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1994) 164-65. 14. In her 1839 "Note on the Early Poems," Mary suggests that "O! There are Spirits" was "addressed in idea to Coleridge" (quoted from PW 527).</page><page sequence="9">SHELLEY AND NAPOLEON BONAPARTE 407 hominem piece in the Alastor volume?moves towards a similar construc tion of Napoleonic apostasy. Tellingly, there is also strong evidence linking Napoleon directly to Shelley's most sustained investigation of the imagina tion and its discontents: Alastor itself. We can best approach this evidence by returning to the "difficult" letter with which we began. Prior to his critique of Allied "enormities" in France, Shelley responds to what Hogg's previous letter must have said about "a missionary" with whom he had "travelled" (Letters i: 429). Shel ley laments that this man's "benevolence and talent" was "wasted in profitless endeavours," a reference, presumably, to the missionary's (from a Shelleyan point of view) misguided faith (Letters 1: 429). "Yet who is there," Shelley concludes: that will not pursue phantoms, spend his choicest hours in hunting after dreams, and wake only to perceive his error and regret that death is so near? One man there is, and he is a cold and calculating man, who knows better than to waste life, but who alas! cannot enjoy it. (429-30) The extent to which this passage anticipates the fate of Alastor s poet protagonist?who likewise spends his "choicest hours . . . hunting after" a "phantom" of his own imagining?is obvious, and has been noted by Shelley's critics (see Poems 1: 448). But who is the dissenting "one man" to whom Shelley refers? William Wordsworth, of course, is the obvious contender given Shelley's prominent contemporary critique of the author of The Excursion.15 But did Shelley also have Napoleon in mind here? Wordsworth's "October 1803" had certainly already characterized Bonaparte?in strikingly similar terms?as "one man, of men the meanest too!" (2; my emphasis).16 However, Shelley could hardly credit Napoleon with knowing "better than to waste life," and the next sentence of his let ter seems rather to confirm that he must have counted Bonaparte amongst those who?like Alastor's protagonist?"pursue phantoms" and "dreams" of the imagination. "Even the men who hold dominion over nations," Shelley writes: fatigue themselves by the interminable pursuit of emptiest visions; the honour and power which they seek is enjoyed neither in acquirement, 15- For a thorough, if somewhat schematic account of Shelley's literary engagement with Wordsworth, which reached its peak in 1815-16, see G. K. Blank, Wordsworth's Influence on Shelley (London: MacMillan, 1988). If Wordsworth is indeed the "one man" to whom Shel ley refers, then this would certainly complicate conventional readings of his role as a "proto type" of Alastor s poet protagonist. For an example of this kind of reading, see Blank 50-54, 98-112. 16. Wordsworth's sonnet was first published in his 1807 Poems in Two Volumes, which Shelley ordered in 1812 (Letters 1: 345).</page><page sequence="10">408 CIAN DUFFY possession or retrospect; for what is the fame that attends the most skilful deceiver or destroyer? What the power which awakens not in its progression more wants than it can supply? (Letters i: 345) Arguably, then, Shelley is drawing an equivalence here between the "inter minable pursuit" of "dominion over nations" and the kind of imaginative dysfunction described in Alastor, the more so since that poem presumably adds the imagination itself to the totalizing category of "power" which "awakens in its progression more wants than it can supply." The passage is not, in other words, a simple claim that "dominion" won't make you happy. Rather, again, Shelley's letter appears to equate the "intermina ble"?and, from a contemporary point of view?quintessentially Napole onic "pursuit" of "dominion over nations" with the solipsistic pursuit of "phantoms" explored in Alastor. This equation is clearly problematic to the extent that?while undeniably critical?Alastor also exhibits a great deal of sympathy for the poet-protagonist's "generous error" (Poems 1: 448; my em phasis). On the other hand, this ambivalence parallels Shelley's complex attitude to Napoleon, to the fact that it was the erstwhile defender of the French Revolution who became its "destroyer" (to use the terms of his letter to Hogg). And once again, Shelley's letter seems to invite and en able just such a parallel, that is, seems to identify Napoleonic apostasy in terms of what Alastor would shortly thereafter define as the collapse of the imagination. Obviously, this suggestion would be considerably strengthened if Alastor itself could be seen to engage with Bonaparte on these or similar terms. I certainly have no intention of proposing here that we add Napoleon's name to the already-lengthy list of possible "prototypes" for Alastor s poet protagonist. Indeed, I entirely agree with Edward Duffy's perception that any such naming strategy risks the "fruitless over-specification of Shelley's theme": "instances and personalities are not the focus of Shelley's atten tion," Duffy notes; rather he is "seeking to define a generic morphology."17 However, I believe there is evidence to suggest that Shelley had Napoleon in mind when formulating Alastor s account of this "morphology." This evidence centers on the poet-protagonist's epiphanic experience in "Dark Ethiopia," immediately prior to his disastrous dream of the "veiled maid," the crisis point of the poem (115, 151). Alastors critics have long noted that Shelley's description of the poet-protagonist's subsequent "overland route" from "Ethiopia" to Medea (lines 140-353) draws on Alexander the Great's Indian expedition in 327 BC (see Poems 1: 448). What I want to suggest here, however, is that the poet-protagonist's experience in "Ethiopia" it self, the experience leading up to his fatal vision of the "veiled maid," 17- Edward Duffy, Rousseau in England: The Context for Shelley's Critique of the Enlighten ment (Berkeley: U of California P, 1979) 94.</page><page sequence="11">SHELLEY AND NAPOLEON BONAPARTE 409 marks Shelley's engagement with an altogether more recent colonial expe dition: Napoleon's ultimately disastrous invasion of Egypt. Begun in May 1798, Napoleon's Egyptian campaign sought, first and foremost, to establish a secure source of food for the increasingly embattled French Republic. Beyond this immediate necessity, however, there was clearly also a larger geo-political agenda at work. Obviously, the French in vasion of Egypt threatened British imperial possessions in India and the Middle East. However, it is important to recognize that this threat was not simply a matter of territorial expansion, but also had far-reaching cultural implications. Construed as a benevolent (Revolutionary) colonialism, de signed to liberate the Egyptian populace from Mameluke oppression, the French expedition also sought to recuperate Egypt's classical past. Inspired by Alexander's aforementioned Indian expedition, Napoleon took 150 sa vants with him to Egypt: the so-called Institute de Caire. Their spectacu larly successful archaeological recovery of Egyptian antiquity represented a clear threat to the growing British investment in the Indian origins of Euro pean civilization (exemplified in the work of Sir William Jones and the Asiatic Society). Hence, again, the French invasion of Egypt represented much more than a mere territorial threat to British Oriental interests: rather, the French recovery of Egypt's classical past initiated a struggle over the ownership of the historical origins of European culture, a struggle that would long outlast the Napoleonic wars. Despite initial military successes however?including the rout of the Mamelukes at the Battle of the Pyra mids on July 21 st?Napoleon's expedition soon ran into difficulties, both with insurgent natives and with the British. The French navy was de stroyed by Nelson at Abukir only 10 days after the Battle of the Pyramids, effectively trapping Napoleon in Egypt, and depriving him of any aid from home. And while Napoleon successfully repulsed both native insurgency and a number of British-supported attacks by the Turks and Syrians over the next year, in August 1799 the increasing threat to France itself eventu ally forced him to abandon his armies in Egypt and return to Paris. (French troops were finally expelled from Egypt, by a combination of British and Ottoman forces, in October 1801.) Overall, then, Napoleon's Egyptian campaign was a paradoxical blend of libertarian, culturally recuperative colonialism and bloody territorial con quest. In fact, as Nigel Leask points out, the campaign "seemed to repre sent in miniature the fate of the 'blissful dawn' of the French Revolution itself"; indeed, from a post-Waterloo perspective, it might be seen to mark Napoleon's personal transition from apostle to apostate of Revolutionary Liberty.18 It is precisely this parallel, I want to suggest, that Alastor examines 18.

Alastor 's account of the poet-protagonist's time in "Ethiopia" immedi ately recalls the archaeological activities of Napoleon's Institute de Caire, enumerating visits to "the eternal Pyramids, / Memphis and Thebes, and whatsoe'er of strange / Sculptured on alabaster obelisk, / Or jasper tomb, or mutilated sphinx, / Dark Ethiopia in her desert hills / Conceals" (in? 16). However, Alastor also alludes to one of the Expedition's specific dis coveries. The relevant passage, while well known, is worth quoting at length: . . . Among the ruined temples there, Stupendous columns, and wild images Of more than man, where marble daemons watch The Zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead men Hang their mute thoughts on mute walls around, He lingered, poring on memorials Of the world's youth, through the long burning day Gazed on these speechless shapes, nor, when the moon Filled the mysterious halls with floating shades Suspended he that task, but ever gazed And gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind Flashed like strong inspiration, and he saw The thrilling secrets of the birth of time. (i 16-128) As Matthews and Everest note, the "Zodiac" referred to in these lines is undoubtedly the famous sculpted Zodiac discovered by Napoleon's savants in the temple of Isis at Denderah (Poems 1: 468, n. 119). Matthews and Ev erest propose Vivant Denon's Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte, pen dant les Campagns du General Bonaparte (1801) as Shelley's source of infor mation about this Zodiac (Poems 1: 448, n. 119). However, I believe he may well also have seen the relevant illustration in the multi-volume De scription de VEgypte, the encyclopaedic account of the Expedition's discov eries, published throughout Shelley's lifetime "par les Ordres de sa Majeste l'Empereur, Napoleon le Grand" (as the title-page had it).19 Plate 21, in Volume 4 of the Antiquites. Planches, depicts Denderah's Zodiac. But? significantly?it also depicts, to the right of the Zodiac, a woman wearing a full-length transparent robe, her body clearly visible beneath it, and with 19- Description de I'Egypte, 22 vols.

Did this depiction give Shelley the idea for the poet-protagonist's dream of the "veiled maid," with her "bare" "outstretched" "arms" and "glowing limbs beneath [a] sinuous veil"? (176 77). If it did?and that seems plausible?then this is doubly important. Firstly, it provides us with the strongest evidence to date that Shelley had in fact seen the Antiquites plates from the Description, long-suspected as a possi ble source for "Ozymandias" (1817).20 Secondly?and more importantly for our purposes here?it would support the idea of a conceptual link in Shelley's thought between the Alastor-poet's experience in Ethiopia and his imagining of the "veiled maid," the link which I am suggesting marks the poem's engagement with the Egyptian Expedition. Broadly speaking, the "secrets of the birth of time" that the Alastor-ipoet learns in Egypt recall the spectacular archaeological discoveries made by Napoleon's Institute de Caire: discoveries about the antiquity of Egyptian civilization, and about the possible Egyptian origins ("birth") of European civilization.21 The connection of these "secrets" to the Zodiac is premised upon contemporary speculation about the conceptual "birth" of "time" in the study of the stars, i.e. about the first calendars. Indeed, Shelley's sense of these "secrets" may well have been drawn specifically from one of the most influential of the ideologue texts: Constantin Volney's Les Ruines, ou, Meditations sur la Revolutions des Empires (1791).22 In the twenty-second chapter of Les Ruines, Volney locates the "origin" of "religious ideas" in primitive man's anthropomorphic reaction to sublime natural phenomena beyond his comprehension.23 Volney singles out the "Worship of the Stars" as a particularly important source of these "ideas," arguing that the "filiation" of "religious" imagery stems from its common-source in the constellations (2: 77, 61). Volney then proceeds to suggest that by compar ing primitive Zodiacs with nascent scientific theory about equinoctial pre cession, one could date the "birth" of the "first principles" of religion to "about 17,000 years ago" (2: 84601.; my emphasis). The clear verbal and thematic echoes here, then, indicate that the "thrilling secrets" learned by 20. Nigel Leask has recently reopened the question of whether Shelley knew the Planches. See Curiosity 125?26. 21.

Whatever the precise reference of Alastor s "secrets of the birth of time," however, taken as a whole, the "Dark Ethiopia" episode clearly draws upon the impressive archaeological discoveries of the Institute de Caire. Nevertheless, Alastor also makes it clear that a heavy human price has been paid for these discoveries, a price that must be offset against any philan thropic credit gained. This human price?the less benevolent, colonialist dimension of the Egyptian Expedition?is figured in the poem through tie Alastor-poet's relationship with the "Arab Maiden" who tends him during his stay in Ethiopia (129). This maiden "brought his food," Shelley affirms: Her daily portion, from her father's tent, And spread her matting for his couch, and stole From duties and repose to end his steps:? Enamoured, yet not daring for deep awe To speak her love:?and watched his nightly sleep, Sleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips Parted in slumber, whence the regular breath Of innocent dreams arose: then, when red morn Made paler the pale moon, to her cold home Wildered, and wan, and panting, she returned. (129-39) Alastor s critics have generally pointed to the poet-protagonist's lack of concern for this "Maiden"?his lack, in the terms of the Preface, of "hu man sympathy"?as evidence of the fatal solipsism that will soon manifest itself in his rather less than "innocent" dream of the "veiled maid" (Poems 1: 463). I certainly have no quarrel with this reading: the poet-protagonist evidently ignores the "Arab Maiden" only to succumb to an autoerotic imagining, although it is important to remember that Shelley describes this "error" as "generous," this "superstition" as "illustrious" (Poems 1: 463). However, if the poet-protagonist's time in "Dark Ethiopia" recalls the ar chaeological discoveries of Napoleon's Egyptian Expedition, then his rela tionship with the "Arab Maiden" certainly also echoes the increasingly strained relations between the Expedition and the native populace. After all, it is not simply that the foreign poet-protagonist ignores the indigenous "Maiden." Rather his relationship with her is unequivocally exploitative: her native resources are diverted to support his foreign "task," a "task" which, while undeniably significant in world-historical terms, remains both unintelligible and of no obvious or immediate benefit to herself. Indeed it</page><page sequence="15">SHELLEY AND NAPOLEON BONAPARTE 413 is no doubt significant, in this regard, that Shelley points first to the Arab Maiden's donation of her food; we remember, after all, that the primary aim of the Egyptian Expedition was to secure food supplies for the French Republic. What I am suggesting, then, is that at the heart of Alastor s meditation on the collapse of the poetic imagination we have an engagement with the shifting agenda of Napoleon's Egyptian expedition: from benevolent, and culturally recuperative colonialism to simple imperial exploitation. In other words, my point is not simply that Alastor forges conceptual links between political apostasy and imaginative dysfunction (as readings of the poem's engagement with Wordsworth have long recognized). Rather, it is that these links have a specifically Napoleonic context and resonance. And it is this sense?of the connection between Bonaparte's betrayal of revolution ary "virtue" and the collapse of the imagination?that forms the basis for Shelley's ongoing engagement with the First Consul turned Emperor. As already noted, Napoleon features necessarily in many of Shelley's ma ture meditations on European political history?works like the Ode to Lib erty and Philosophical View of Reform. In the wake of Prometheus Unbound, Shelley clearly planned another major engagement with Bonaparte: a note book entry from late 1819 contains some brief sketches for "a drama / on Bonaparte."24 The first projected scene of this work returns us to territory familiar from "To the Emperors . . .": "scene of Battle . . . one of the first in which / Bonaparte was conqueror" (HM2176, 9v). The working theme for the play?"that a bad &amp; weak man / is he who rules over bad &amp; we[ak men?]"?hardly did justice to Shelley's now nuanced understanding of Bonaparte, however, and the drama was taken no further in its original form (HM2176, 9v). Nevertheless, it seems likely that ideas for the project were taken up again in The Triumph of Life's more sophisticated account of Napoleon: an approximately contemporary MS note compares Bonaparte and Rousseau in terms which clearly anticipate Shelley's final poem.25 Before the Triumph, however, Shelley returned to Napoleon with his "Lines Written on Hearing the News of the Death of Napoleon," pub lished in his 1822 Hellas volume.26 "Lines Written ..." can be divided into two parts: in the first two stanzas, a speaker questions "Mother Earth" about her reaction to Napoleon's death; in the final three stanzas, Earth re sponds to these questions (12). More precisely, Shelley's speaker wonders how Earth can be "alive and so bold" after Bonaparte's death: "Are not the 24. Huntington Library MS. HM2176, f.or-8v.

(i, 7-8, 11-12). These exaggerated questions reflect on the trope of the Titanic Napoleon, described by Bainbridge; in deed they specifically invoke the Promethean Napoleon, the "fiery spirit" born of "Mother Earth" (15). They are apparently asked, however, with out any hint of irony on the speaker's part. Earth, at least, takes?and re bukes?them seriously: "It is thou who art overbold," she assures the speaker (19). The important thing about Earth's "scorn"-ful response to Shelley's speaker, however, is not her insistence that Napoleon's death is unremarkable since she "fold[s]" all her "sons" to her "bosom" when "their knell is knolled" (20, 21-22). Rather, it is the evident?and quite sinister?pleasure that Earth takes from this "folding": "I grow bolder and still more bold," she affirms: "The dead fill me ten thousandfold / Fuller of speed, and splendour, and mirth . . . / I feed on whom I fed" (26?28, 33). These grim sentiments are certainly located within a natural cycle of de struction and rebirth?"with living motion all are fed, / And the quick spring like weeds out of the dead"?but this hardly lessens their almost vin dictive, anthropomorphic impact (23?24). And once again, "Napoleon's fierce spirit" evidently represents a special prize: Earth affirms that his "shame" "shrouds" her, and recalls to the speaker's attention the revolu tionary "hopes that from his glory fled" (34, 40). Shelley's "Lines ..." accordingly end with a now familiar portrait of the "shameful" Napoleon: the apostate "hope" of the French Revolution, the "Anarch" of liberty's "bewildered powers," to use the terms of the Ode to Liberty (175). However it is also important to recognize the extent to which Earth, in the "Lines . . . ," anticipates the charioteer-"shape" at the heart of Shelley's final poetic engagement with Napoleon in the unfinished Tri umph of Life (343).27 The Triumph is obviously rich in literary and historical allusion. In closing, however, I want to look at Napoleon's role in the most contemporary of these allusions: namely, The Triumph's meditation on the history of the French Revolution, the "times that were / And scarce have ceased to be" (233-34). In his Defence of Poetry, Shelley defines both the historical scope and the social responsibility of the imagination. As critics of The Triumph have long recognized, the victims of "Life" are precisely those who have failed to live up to that responsibility: "the triumph of life," as Hodgson put it, "is the failure of the imagination."28 While Voltaire, Frederick, Catherine, 27.

For a useful account of the precise dynamics of this failure,</page><page sequence="17">SHELLEY AND NAPOLEON BONAPARTE 415 Leopold and Kant (in the MS) are all named as victims, however, it is un doubtedly Napoleon ("the child of a fierce hour") who is the most promi nent captive to be led in chains behind the triumphal Chariot (217, 235-36; Reiman 166).29 This prominence is established by the fact that seeing Na poleon prompts the narrator to ask what is arguably the central question in The Triumph?'why God made irreconcilable / Good and the means of good'?a question obviously predicated upon Napoleon's own relationship with the French revolution (231). It is confirmed by the fact that it is Rousseau (the supposed architect of the revolution) and Napoleon (its de fender-turned-betrayer) who form the major historical poles of the surviv ing fragment. Let me not be misunderstood here: The Triumph of Life is obviously much more concerned with Rousseau?and with exploring the world historical consequences of his flawed vision?than it is with Napoleon. Im portantly, however, it is also concerned with the relationship between the two men. The Triumph identifies Napoleon?in now familiar terms?as an opportunist who "sought to win / The world, and lost all that it did con tain / Of greatness, in its hope destroyed" (217-19). Shelley also expands in familiar terms on the dynamics of this collapse, confirming that Napo leon?like Alastor s protagonist before him?was one of those who failed "to know themselves" (212). This criterion of failure obviously echoes the well-known statement of the Delphic oracle, but it also recalls the conclu sion of Shelley's 1821 sonnet "Political Greatness," which doubtless has Napoleon in mind when it affirms that: "Man who man would be, / Must rule the empire of himself" (10?11). Significantly, however, The Triumph also identifies Napoleon as the con sequence of Rousseau's imaginative failure: in a cancelled passage of the draft, Rousseau?pointing to the tyrants chained to the "chariot" of "Life"?acknowledges that "these had their birth / . . . from the death of such as I" (Reiman 177). An essential distinction between Rousseau and Napoleon is thus established and maintained throughout The Triumph, a distinction primarily signalled by the fact that while Napoleon is chained to the chariot, Rousseau is free and able, in some measure, to analyze and in terpret the spectacle for the narrator. The Triumph also makes the basis for this distinction explicit. In a footnote to the Defence, Shelley singles out see David Quint, "Representation and Ideology in The Triumph of Life," Studies in English Literature 18 (1978): 639-57. Quint argues persuasively that The Triumph's "subject matter" is "a death-in-life occasioned by man's surrender to ideological representation," what The Tri umph calls "thought's empire over thought" (211; Quint 642). 29. Christ and Socrates are listed among "the sacred few" who have not been defeated by "Life" (128-36).</page><page sequence="18">416 CIAN DUFFY Rousseau?as "essentially a poet"?from his enlightenment peers, and in The Triumph, too, Rousseau is a creator: he admits, not altogether asham edly, that he has "created, even / If it be but a world of agony," i.e., the world of post-Napoleonic Europe (284-85).30 Napoleon, by contrast, is equally explicitly identified as "the child of a fierce hour," as of those whose "power was given / But to destroy," as a passing "shadow," in an echo of Earth's reproach in Shelley's 1821 "Lines . . . ," "whose grasp had left the giant world so weak / That every pigmy kicked it as it lay" (217, my em phasis; 292-93; 225-27). Hence, while Rousseau affirms that though he has "been extinguished, yet there rise / A thousand beacons from the spark I bore," Napoleon is led in chains under "a moving arch of victory" after the "dread war" of Waterloo, an "arch" that ironically evokes the Arc de Triomphe he had himself begun in 1806 (206?7, 439&gt; 436).31 We are re minded, of course, of the fate of Alastor s poet-protagonist at the hands of his own "debauched" imagining. In the final analysis, then, Napoleon fails to live up to the criteria of the Poet as laid down by Shelley's Defence: ulti mately a destroyer rather than a creator of revolutionary liberty, he is a vic tim of "Life," of the failure of the imagination. What I have been suggesting here, then, is not simply that Shelley's work participates in the Romantic debate about Napoleon, but that Napo leon was actually an important test case for Shelley's developing under standing of "the relationship of poetical to political power" (to use Bain bridge's phrase). In a footnote to his 1812 "Retrospect of Times Old," Shelley had listed "Buonaparte" along with "Frederic of Prussia . . . Suwarroff, Wellington and Nelson" among "the most skilful and notori ous" of the "legal murderers of our own age" (Poems 1: 244, n. 72). By the time that Napoleon and Frederick reappear in The Triumph of Life, Shel ley's sense of Bonaparte has shifted away from such easy dismissal towards an understanding of Napoleonic apostasy that feeds directly into his con cept of the legislator-Poet: in 1822, the "Anarch" of Liberty's "bewildered powers" is also recognized as the "Anarch" of the imagination.
