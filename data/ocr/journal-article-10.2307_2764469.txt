<plain_text><page sequence="1">METHODS OF POLITICAL REASONING WILLIAM SEAL CARPENTER Princeton University ABSTRACT Political theory in the past has been marked by frequent attempts to set up a universal theory of the state. Because of the desperately complex character of the materials of political reasoning, these attempts have failed. Nevertheless it is possi- ble for political science to develop its own technique. In this process the intimate connection between history and political science has given rise to the historical anal- ogy. Although imperfect, the historical analogy is preferable to a priori reasoning from supposed fundamental principles. The latter method, developed by the Ben- thamites, exerted a vicious influence in political thought throughout the greater part of the nineteenth century. It has now been discarded in favor of the statistical method advocated by Jevons. But mere statistical data remain unintelligible with- out being related to various facts of social life. There is needed a logic through which to synthesize the essential elements common to the social sciences. Sociology, having established the so-called social hypothesis, should undertake the task of as- sisting the special social sciences by the development of a new logic through which the discoveries made in each science may be made readily available to students of allied sciences. "I doubt whether the history of mankind is yet complete enough, if it ever can be so, to furnish ground for a sure theory on the internal causes which necessarily affect the fortune of a state," Thus Edmund Burke declared his belief that no system of politics can be immutable. But his confession of defeat did not stay the purpose of those who sought in framing a doctrine of government to lay down eternal principles, which may never be transgressed. The dogma of Divine Right had already been shattered once and for all by the polemic of Locke against Filmer, and in Burke's own day the social contract was crushed beneath the weight of Hume's logic. The field thus left vacant was soon to be occupied by another claimant, who demanded that men assent to the doc- trine that the end of government is the greatest happiness for the greatest number. From large and untried generalizations about the fundamental "facts" of human nature the Benthamites sought to erect the principle of utility into a theory of the state. Because its psychology was wrong, utilitarianism was left to perish before its last great leader was out of the struggle. ZI3</page><page sequence="2">2I4 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY It may be admitted that "a universal theory of the state is a chimaera, for historical development and national character are the most important of all considerations in investigating the laws of political development."' These give rise to materials which are desperately complex. The first step in political science must be to place it upon a basis of fact; its theories must be grounded on ob- jective evidence.2 But this is necessarily only the beginning in any science. The collection and arrangement of facts must lead to the formation of principles if politics is not to be a mere matter of acci- dent or chance. Specific facts are of no value unless they lead to a generalization, and a generalization is of value only in so far as it calls to mind specific instances. At the very outset, the student of politics is confronted with grave difficulties by reason of the character of his materials. His- torical data, unlike those of the physical sciences, recur neither in definite cycles nor at indeterminate intervals. They are not repro- ducible at our own volition, as in all experimental phenomena, but succeed each other in an interminable and perpetually varying se- ries. The historian is only now beginning to establish a few tenta- tive hypotheses which may, after patient investigation, attain the stability of laws.3 Nor are the data arising from the observation of national character more readily handled. The psychologist has demonstrated, I think, that there is a single instinct, that of gre- gariousness, which makes social life at all possible and altruism a reality.4 But altruism is largely antagonized by the non-rational inferences by which men form many of their political opinions. National character has a substratum of prejudices which are read- ily exploited by demagogue and jingoist. Differences of race and color are therefore made the justification for internecine struggles which in each age become more devastating. Not even Christian- ity, which asserts the universal brotherhood of man, has been able to turn the prejudices of men into channels which promote human progress. 1Figgis, Divine Right of Kings, p.

The student of politics might well admit in the beginning that the methods of the natural sciences are not avail- able for his purposes. He cannot, like the mathematician, deal with the immutably fixed elements of time, space, and number. Nor can the controlled experiment of the physicist and the chemist be in- troduced at the present time into the social sciences. The labora- tory of political science is the world in which men live, where the opportunities for study and observation cannot be regulated at the will of the student. Finally, the results of political study must be stated without resort to an esoteric terminology. They must, if they are to be of practical value, be understood by the man in the street or at least the man in the legislative assembly. In short, po- litical science must develop its own methods of study and perfect its own scientific technique. To the aid of political science in this task must be brought the allied social sciences. The intimate connection between history and political science has been evidenced in political literature since the time of Aristotle. The work of the historian has always been seized upon to form the foundation of political speculation and to bear the burden of ap- propriate analogies. Indeed, the historian Freeman was led to re- mark that "history is past politics and politics present history." While this proposition is today acceptable neither to the historian nor the political scientist, the debt of politics to history cannot be denied. The advance in the accuracy and profundity of historical writing in recent years has resulted in a corresponding increase in the worth of political speculation. The extent of this progress is re- vealed by a glance at the use of historical data common in eight- eenth-century political reasoning. Among the leading statesmen of the United States at the time of the framing of the Constitution none stood out more conspicu- ously than James Madison. He was essentially a scholar in politics, blending together vast knowledge and profound insight into human nature. A graduate of Princeton in the Class of I77I, Madison re-</page><page sequence="4">2I6 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY turned for further study. His undergraduate training in the clas- sics was followed by the reading of Hobbes, Locke, Sidney, Pufen- dorf, and other writers on political science in the library of Presi- dent Witherspoon.' The writings of Montesquieu, which formed the basis of Witherspoon's classroom lectures, Madison studied minutely. He possessed the complete equipment which marked the man of education in the American colonies, and his ability to quote from Livy or Plutarch's Lives and to explain the political con- trivances of the ancient world assured him respectful attention in any assembly. It is well known that in the Convention of I 787 Madison's in- fluence, more than that of any other delegate, determined the form and structure of the government there created. To the inventive genius of Madison, government was a problem to be worked out by the superior minds in the convention, without considering the opin- ions of the "unreflecting multitude."6 The method of his political reasoning was very largely from historical analogy. He assumed, as Montesquieu had done, the accuracy and sufficiency of the ac- counts left by the Roman historians, and never hesitated upon the questions of the nature of republics and the principles underlying confederacies to cite examples from the ancient world. In one of the first sessions, Mr. Madison in a very able and ingenious speech, ran through the whole scheme of the Government,-pointed out all the beauties and defects of ancient Republics; compared their situation with ours wherever it appeared to bear any analogy, and proved that the only way to make a Government answer all the ends of its institution was to collect the wisdom of its several parts in aid of each other whenever it was necessary.7 When William Paterson introduced what became known as the "small State plan" for the modification of the Articles of Confed- eration, Madison led the opposition and "reviewed the Amphyc- tionic and Achaean confederacies among the ancients, and the Hel- 5The Library of Princeton University possesses the classroom lectures of Dr. Witherspoon.

In an age which could not boast of critical scholarship, his facts were manifestly insufficient. More- over, it was felt that the differences in his comparisons were more striking than the agreements. Charles Pinckney impatiently re- torted: The people of this country are not only very different from the inhabi- tants of any State which we are acquainted with in the modern world . but their situation is distinct from either the people of Greece or Rome, or of any State we are acquainted with among the ancients. Can the orders intro- duced by the institution of Solon, can they be found in the United States? Can the military habits and manners of Sparta be resembled to our habits and manners? Can the Helvetic or Belgian confederacies, or can the unwieldy, un- meaning body called the Germanic Empire, can they be said to possess either the same or a situation like ours? He denied that any two people were so exactly alike as to admit of the same political institutions. "A system," he said, "must be suit- ed to the habits and genius of the people it is to govern, and must grow out of them."9 Many years later John Stuart Mill in the opening sentences of his famous essay on representative government summed up the two conflicting theories respecting political institutions revealed in the debate between Madison and Pinckney. But the Federal Conven- tion anticipated Mill in holding that each of these doctrines is un- tenable if pushed to an exclusive and logical conclusion. The fram- ers of the Constitution discovered that although the construction of a government may be the result of the conscious purposes of men, the institutions set up must be congenial to the spirit of the people for whom they are intended. 8 Ibid., p. 3I7.

But the same innocuous character cannot be claimed for the type of thinking which came in the wake of Bentham and his great discovery that "man, from the very constitution of his nature, pre- fers his own happiness to that of all other sensitive beings put to- gether."'1 Today the student of politics is on guard against a pri- ori reasoning from supposed fundamental principles." But for the greater part of the nineteenth century Benthamism reigned su- preme, and the "Table of the Springs of Action" supplied the logic of the statesman. Alexander Hamilton, despite the practical character of his statesmanship, defended and utilized in his political thinking the method of a priori deduction from assumed first principles." In disquisitions of every kind," he said, "there are certain primary truths, or first principles, upon which all subsequent reasonings must depend."'2 Hamilton does not pretend that the principles of ethics and politics rank with the axioms of geometry, but they are often "so obvious in themselves, and so agreeable to the natural and unsophisticated dictates of common sense, that they challenge the assent of a sound and unbiased mind, with a degree of force and conviction almost equally irresistible." For example, "there are certain social principles in human nature from which we may draw the most solid conclusion with respect to the conduct of indi- viduals and of communities. We love our families more than our neighbors; we love our neighbors more than our countrymen in general. The human affections, like the solar heat, lose their inten- sity as they depart from the center, and become languid in propor- tion to the expansion of the circle in which they act."'3 Indeed, the refusal to give assent to such principles of moral and political knowledge, Hamilton regarded as evidence of a mind perverted by interest, passion, or prejudice. Hamilton's law of political development, that "every institu- 0 Bentham, Works, X, 80. 11Wallas, Human Nature in Politics, chap. v. 2 Federalist, No. 3I. 13 Elliot, Debates, II, 354.</page><page sequence="7">METHODS OF POLITICAL REASONING 2I9 tion will grow and flourish in proportion to the quantity and extent of the means concentred towards its formation and support,"14 was a deduction from the assumption that men always pursue their in- terests.15 "Men will pursue their interests," Hamilton told the New York Convention in I 788. "It is as easy to change human nature as to oppose the strong current of selfish passions. A wise legislator will gently divert the channel, and direct it, if possible, to the pub- lic good."16 As the first Secretary of the Treasury under Washing- ton, Hamilton acted brilliantly upon this principle as he brought the great business interests of the North and East to the support of the new government. But he failed in the end because he did not put his trust in the sympathies of the people. His realism would not permit him to see that men often cling through sentiment to in- stitutions which may be shown by rational arguments to be imper- fect. His great rival, Jefferson, "though not ignorant of the arti- fices of practical politics, appreciated at more nearly their true value the force of sentiment and disinterestedness in the United States, and was thereby sustained through great vicissitudes of fortune and under the most trying circumstances."'7 It may be argued that the type of reasoning indulged by Ham- ilton draws its inspiration from John Locke's Essay concerning Human Understanding rather than the works of the founder of Utilitarianism. But the failure to set up the Benthamite parapher- nalia on American soil is largely due to the peculiar characteristics of the nation's economy. The abundance of free land, the extent and richness of the natural resources, the enterprise and optimism of the people, and the scope for individual initiative combined to give the United States an era of unparalleled prosperity. "The law of diminishing returns, the Malthusian doctrine of population, the law of the tendency of profits towards a minimum, the wages fund doctrine, seemed to have no application to this country."18 The '4 Federalist, No. ii- " An analysis of the effect of interest on opinion will be found in Lowell, Public Opinion in War and Peace, pp. 53-55. 8 Elliot, Debates, II, 320.

"The men of both parties were individualistic in spirit, and they were interested in the great American task of improving their own con- dition in this world. They both wanted a government which would secure them freedom of action for this purpose."9 Now individualism from the outset was the chief characteristic of Benthamism. It was the object of Bentham and his followers to show that every individual by striving solely to promote his own happiness inevitably tended to promote the happiness of society. Paley's theology, Whateley's ethics and economics, Romilly's legal reforms, and the economic and political theories of Ricardo and James Mill were all designed to shed the beneficent light of the "greatest happiness principle" upon a people fast sinking in the morass of the industrial revolution. The results were unfortunate. Instead of providing a democratic social system, Benthamism in the form of a philistine political economy became the philosophy of despair for the great mass of British workingmen.20 The manu- facturers of England alone profited by its teachings. In short, in- dividualism became the accepted philosophy of the small but ag- gressive class of British capitalists who were turning England into the workshop of the world. On this side of the Atlantic, however, individualism was a na- tional rather than a class characteristic. It grew in strength as each advance of the pioneers subdued the Indians, cleared the for- ests, and established new settlements. As each decade saw the frontier receding ever farther from the Atlantic seaboard there was evidenced a growth in prosperity and an improved standard of liv- ing among the people. The hardy settler might from abject poverty arrive at comfort within a few years and even enjoy luxury for a brief period before being gathered to his fathers. In such a society individualistic and democratic tendencies readily crystallized into a formal political creed. Individualism in America was grounded upon no supposed fundamental principles as in England. It was rather a hasty de- 9 Croly, The Promise of American Life, p. 32. 20 Wallas, The Great Society, pp. III-I2.</page><page sequence="9">METHODS OF POLITICAL REASONING 22I duction from superficial observation. Nowhere were the founda- tions of society subjected to scientific analysis.2' Conclusive and mouth-filling phrases served to formulate the political ideas of a people who were in each year growing more prosperous and enjoy- ing an improved standard of living. The belief was general that if people remained poor it was their own fault. Political issues turned solely upon what government might do to further material pros- perity. Henry Clay, under pressure from the West for legislation which would bring the products of the factory to the farm, went from free trade to protection with an amazing disregard for the logical quality of his arguments or the soundness of his proposi- tions.22 Webster, who opposed Clay in the tariff debates of I824, four years later became an advocate of high tariffs on the ground that New England had become protectionist in order to gratify the demand from the West for manufactured goods. But he saw no reason either to engage in critical examination of the basis upon which a protectionist policy should rest or to reconcile his position with the principles laid down in his earlier argument.23 Webster joined the other members of Congress from New England, the Mid- dle States, and the West, who "vied with one another in raising protective duties, by a wild log-rolling process, on the different ar- ticles in which their constituents were respectively interested."24 A hard materialism thus crept into American politics unrelieved by any professions or boasts of purity of motives. The economists, who might be expected to furnish the scientific thought lacking in the politicians, did little to remedy the defects in the methods of political reasoning. Daniel Raymond, whose Thoughts on Political Economy first appeared in I820, did recog- nize the anomaly of protection in an individualistic society. But he advocated a scheme of governmental interference so far in advance 21 A recent writer on political theory declares that the United States since I845 has produced little political philosophy that is of first importance.

At the same time he argued that government should promote industry by originating knowledge, which must otherwise be obtained at great individual expense-by experimental farms, of which the results should be registered and published by experimental manufactures, which might show, from time to time, what branches of manufacturing could be profitably introduced into a country, and how far they might be most successfully conducted.26 At about the same time that Wayland was writing, Henry Vethake at the University of Pennsylvania was rendering himself unpopular with the vested in- terests of that state by his opposition to the protective tariff.27 But the most prolific as well as the most influential economist in the United States at this period was Henry C. Carey, whose most com- prehensive and mature work appeared in i858.28 Carey had al- ready produced a study of the tariff which was remarkable for the use made of statistical data.29 In the beginning, Carey was an earnest advocate of free trade but came around to the belief in pro- tection as a necessary form of intervention to prevent private ad- vantage from working public mischief. He attributes his conver- sion on the question to his observation of the effects of liberal and protective tariffs respectively on American prosperity. From his 25 Neill, "Daniel Raymond, An Early Chapter in the History of Economic The- ory in the United States" (J.H.U. Studies, I5th Series), pp. 225, 24I. Raymond dis- cusses agriculture, manufactures, and commerce in their influence upon national wealth. Each, he says, is but a part of one great system and wise legislators will en- courage or restrain them in such a way as will best advance national wealth and prosperity. "Private citizens can only be expected to be wise for themselves-it is not their duty to look after the public interests-they are not the conservators of national wealth. This belongs to the department of legislation. If, from particular circumstances .... one species of industry is more profitable than another, it must be expected that individuals will embark in it, without any regard to the evil conse- quences it may produce to succeeding generations; but it does not become a legisla- tor, either to be blind to their consequences, or not to guard against them."

After i88o a new development of thought may be discerned in England and the United States.32 The failure of Benthamism to solve the problems of society led to the overthrow of fixed princi- ples whether of natural rights or of laissez faire. Jevons in Eng- land was arguing that legislation must "always proceed by reason- ing from the most nearly proximate and analogous experience which is available."33 That is to say, a truly "Baconian course in legislation" must be pursued, in the course of which "we must not merely make experiments, but we must make them in the particular way calculated to prove or disprove the conclusion in view."34 Jevons thus pointed to that method of "legislation by statistics" which has become the general rule during the last forty years. In the United States the individualistic theory has undergone far-reaching modifications."5 The extension of the doctrine of po- lice power has not only subjected businesses affected with the pub- lic interest to governmental regulation but has set limits to individ- ual liberty and the property right in the interest of the public.36 Confronted by an overwhelming mass of statistical data in support 30Principles of Social Science, II, 438. 31 Cliffe Leslie, Essays in Political and Moral Philosophy, p.

But as every serious student of social matters knows by his own experience, it is impossible to touch a physical fact, or a statistical datum, or a legal enact- ment, in reference to its social bearing, without its at once, so to speak, coming alive in his hands, and attaching itself to an underlying relation of mind as the only unity which will make it intelligible, and correlate it with other experi- ences, by themselves no less fragmentary.40 In order to escape the futility of regarding mere dumb facts, the student of the social sciences is led to deal in analogies. The his- torical analogy has been supplemented by the analogy from biol- ogy. The imperfect anthropomorphism of the Middle Ages has given place to substantial biological facts and the special analogy of the living organism has come to occupy a peculiar place in social and political thinking. The result has been that the political scien- tist has found it necessary to seek his materials in other sciences with which he is not equipped to deal and which have not been or- dered with a view to his needs. History, economics, statistics, so- ciology, and psychology all furnish materials of value in political research. But unless these can be made more readily available, it is not likely that political science will profit from new discoveries.

Simply the accumula- tion of data without a logic through which to synthesize the essen- tial elements will lead to confusion rather than improvement of po- litical thinking.4' It will be remembered that the task of effecting a synthesis of the various branches of human knowledge was once regarded as the province of philosophy. But the student of the social sciences has had to part company with the philosopher because of the pro- pensity of the latter to indulge in a terminology which cannot be widely understood. The truths of the social sciences must be stated in language which the layman can understand or the sciences fail in their mission. Since the time of Immanuel Kant philosophy has been so occupied with the elaboration of its peculiar terminology that it has ceased to influence the average individual. At the present time a synthesis of the social sciences can be ef- fected most appropriately through the medium of sociology. It was a sociologist who first attacked the individualistic theory sci- entifically and asserted the supremacy of the principle of co-opera- tion over that of competition.42 Subsequent sociological investiga- tions have wholly altered the traditional conception of the relations of society, state and government. "The so-called social hypothesis has now won well-nigh universal triumph."4" This has not been accomplished without arousing a certain amount of professional jealousy, but the inherent worth of the contributions of sociology has become impressed upon the other social sciences. But it is not enough to evolve a philosophical synthesis of the special social sciences. The problem is much greater than this. So- ciology might rest content with the achievement of such a synthe- sis; generalities would be vitalized and completed by the work of the other social sciences, and the phenomena of human association would be revealed in systematic arrangement. But if sociology is 41 For an account of the recent progress in political methods, see the report of the Committee on Political Research, Amer. Pol. Sci.

It has been through the possession and use of a common logic that the natural and physical sciences owe their tremendous advance. It is to the credit of the sociologist that he has emanci- pated himself from the fallacies inherent in the earlier methods of thinking." Perhaps it is not too much to expect that sociology will take the lead in devising a common logic for the social sciences. 4 Evidence of this may be seen in a comparison of the work of almost any of the leading sociological writers quoted by Professor Barnes and John Stuart Mill's chapters on the logic of the moral sciences in Book IV of his Logic.</page></plain_text>
