Contrary to the interpretation of Mannheim as a relativist, we argue, on the basis of a detailed discussion of Ideology and Utopia , that relativism is not the conclusion of his sociology of knowledge but its starting point. Mannheim wants to save the project of epistemology - the reconstruction of a unifying world order - in the light of historical developments which render an absolute solution no longer feasible. He attempts this ambitious project not through the dissolution of epistemology, but rather through a sociological reconstruction of its basic categories. This leads him to an essentially methodological solution to the problems of modernity, the political and sociological implications of which are identified as the elevation of the sociologist to the role of cultural arbitrator and the consequent reduction of differences of interest and value to questions of planning. Introduction Ideology and Utopia is a classical text in the sociology of knowledge. Depending on one's point of view, it is either a decisive step in the development of the subject, or it demonstrates all that is wrong with sociologism. But, as is often the case with classics, advocates and critics alike are liable to read too much or too little into the work. For those working in the area pioneered by Ideology and Utopia , Mannheim's arguments are an embryonic expression of the essential features of their discipline and are to be praised and criticized according to the degree to which they embody a mature sociology of knowledge. In this spirit David Bloor writes: Despite his [Mannheim's] determination to set up causal and symmetrical canons of explanation, his nerve failed him when it came to such apparently autonomous subjects as mathematics and natural science. (Bloor 1976: 8)' Whereas for Bloor Mannheim does not go far enough in developing a sociological conception of knowledge, for his philosophical critics he has already gone decidedly too far in the reduction of knowledge to 'accidentar social factors: Mannheim seems to be reinstating Hume's proposition that reason is and ought to be the slave of passion. (Härtung 1970: 692) and furthermore: Mannheim is guilty of the genetic fallacy in his approach to the problem of validity. He contends that the historical and social genesis of an idea would only be irrelevant to its validity if these had no effect on its content and form.</page><page sequence="2">42 A. SCOTT (Härtung 1970: 699) Both these approaches are in danger of misunderstanding Mannheim's intentions, and hence the meaning of his arguments. Bloor tacitly assumes that Mannheim intended to develop something like a 'strong programme' for the sociology of knowledgç but that something (his failure of nerve) got in the way. Critics like Härtung, but also Popper (1944)2, treat Mannheim as though he were a rather poor epistemologist whose arguments can be identified with a long line of irrationalist thought running from Protagorean relativism, through Humean scepticism, to a self-defeating sociologism. I wish to take issue with both these lines of interpretation, and to show that Mannheim's sociology of knowledge was intended all along to serve the rationalistic end of reconstructing the concept of reason sociologically after the failure of epistemology to achieve this through grounding knowledge in the intellectual capacities of the knowing subject. His purpose was not so much to criticize epistemology as to rescue its project in the light of historical developments which rendered it redundant. Mannheim's sociology of knowledge is neither a failed attempt to develop a 'strong programme' in the sense of Barnes and Bloor, nor relativistic in its intentions. His aim was, rather, to offer a potential solution to what he saw as a central problem of modernity. Thus I give a more central place to the politics of Ideology and Utopia and treat the usual debates which are stimulated by the work concerning relativism, the genetic fallacy and so on, as tangential to his concerns. The question which then arises is whether his arguments are adequate by the standards of his own aims and intentions. . To recover an author's intentions is a problematic business, as our interpretation is inevitably coloured by the distance between ourselves and the original context. Nevertheless, I think it is at least helpful to ask the type of questions suggested by Quentin Skinner (1969) in his influential discussion of the history of ideas3. This means asking such questions as: ťIn which debates is Mannheim intervening?' and 'How does he conceive of his argument as making a contribution to those debates?' These are questions about the context in which the work came into being and how its author understood that context and his own work's significance in it. As Skinner points out, certain types of answer to these questions are ruled out on methodological grounds. Significantly in this case Mannheim cannot have intended Ideology and Utopia as a contribution to subsequent developments which he could not have foreseen, nor, equally importantly, could he have intended it chiefly as a contribution to an area of investigation - epistemology - which he believed to be defunct. The point of such a discussion is not to recover the 'real Mannheim', nor to save him from his critics, but rather to discern an important stimulus to the development of the sociology of knowledge which may still perhaps be at work. Mannheim's critique of epistemology and the theory of ideology In this section I shall first examine the 'preliminary steps' in the argument, namely Mannheim's critique of epistemology. This critique proceeds on two levels: on the level of immanent critique, and on that of cultural critique. His philosophical critics confine themselves to the first, and least interesting, stage of the argument.</page><page sequence="3">POLITICS AND METHOD IN MANNHEIM 43 Mannheim's theoretical objections to epistemology are twofold: firstly, epistem- ology always assumes a subject /object relation and conceives of this relation as static; secondly, it aims to ascribe a privileged cognitive status to certain forms of belief. The first of these arguments Mannheim probably takes from Lukács,4 but whereas Lukács confines his critique to 'bourgeois thought' Mannheim ties it internally to the second feature of epistemology - i.e. it stems from any attempt (including Lukács's) to identify epistemological privilege: Epistemology operated with this isolated and self-sufficient individual as if from the very first he possessed in essence all the capacities characteristic of human beings, including that of pure knowledge, and as if he produced this knowledge of the world from within himself alone, through mere juxtaposition with the external world. (Mannheim 1936: 25) This characterization of epistemology is not an idiosyncratic one. It is, for example, echoed in a more recent and highly influential discussion of the nature of philosophical investigation, Richard Rorty's Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1979): To describe this development [of the notion of knowledge as reflection] as a linear sequence is of course simplistic, but perhaps it helps to think of the original dominating metaphor as being that of having our beliefs determined by being brought face-to-face with the object of belief (the geometrical figure which proves the theorem, for example). The next stage is to think that to understand how to know better is to understand how to improve the activity of a quasi-visual faculty, the Mirror of Nature, and thus to think of knowledge as an assemblage of accurate representations. Then comes the idea that the way to have accurate representation is to find, within the mirror, a special privileged class of representations so compelling that their accuracy cannot be doubted. (Rorty 1979: 163) The comparison with Rorty is interesting not merely because his account 'mirrors' Mannheim's view that 'all epistemological speculation is orientated within the polarity of object and subject' (Mannheim 1936: 12), but also because he too identifies the purpose of such speculation as the desire to act as an arbitrator between competing types of knowledge claim. The theory of representations in which epistemology is grounded aims 'to divide up culture into areas which represent reality well, those which represent it less well, and those which do not represent it at all (despite their pretence of doing so)' (Rorty 1979: 3). What distinguishes Rorty from Mannheim is that only the former mounts his critique for the most part in terms familiar to philosophical debate. Rorty involves himself in technical discussions aiming to show that philosophy-as-cultural- arbitrator falls apart under the weight of its own contradictions. Mannheim's internal critique, by way of contrast, is brief and underdeveloped. His argument relies greatly on views which are merely asserted and assumptions which are made but never justified. We see this, for example, in his defence of his notion of 'relationism' against the charge of relativism, where he is largely content to make the observation that relativism is only a problem for absolutist conceptions of knowledge and truth.5 Mannheim has thus left himself open to a line of criticism which tries to show through traditional philosophical/analytical argument that his position is incoher- ent. But why this lack of concern for the cut and thrust of philosophical debate? Is it</page><page sequence="4">44 A. SCOTT merely because he was not a very good philosopher and was incapable of showing the internal limitations of epistemology? This is not a sufficient explanation of the apparent lacuna. Indeed the lacuna itself may tell us something about Mannheim's views on the matter - namely, that he believed that epistemology is not so much brought down by its internal incoherence as overtaken by historical developments. This gives what I have called his 'cultural critique' of epistemology its centrality in the argument. This cultural critique is essentially the view that the theory of knowledge is defeated by the very historical processes which brought it into being: But after the breakdown which we have described [that of a unified world order], the conception of order in the world of objects which had been guaranteed by the dominance of the church became problematical, and there remained no alternative but to turn about and to take the opposite road, and, with the subject as the point of departure, to determine the nature and value of the human cognitive act, attempting thereby to find an anchorage for objective existence in the knowing subject. (Mannheim 1936: 12) This breakdown is a progressive process which includes the decline of feudalism, the rise of Protestantism and of science; everything which we have come to understand since Weber under the heading of 'disenchantment'. But this historical development had gone too far for epistemology to hope to achieve its purpose; the reconstruction of a unified Weltanschauung by non-religious means.6 It is no coincidence that Mannheim turns so quickly away from the theory of knowledge and towards the theory of ideology in Ideology and Utopia . Epistemology, for Mannheim, does not need to be dissolved from the inside, it already lies rotting on history's slaughter-bench. It is the theory of ideology, with its recognition of the fragmented nature of modern consciousness, which reflects the modern world. This recognition is not consciously present from the first but is progressively forced upon it. Through a series of stages, which Mannheim traces, the theory of ideology becomes increasingly aware of the havoc it has wreaked for the possibility of unification and ultimately for the possibility of agreement in the cultural sphere. In this way Mannheim believes that the distinctions he makes between different levels of the theory of ideology reflect intellectually a process of modernization. The first, and seemingly innocuous, stage he characterizes as follows: The particular conception of ideology is implied when the term denotes that we are sceptical of the ideas and representations advanced by our opponent. (Mannheim 1936: 49) Here we already see that the basic feature of all such theories is present: a refusal to take at face value beliefs held and statements made by opposing social groups, and the tendency to explain them in terms foreign to their proponents. In the social sphere a breakdown of a unified world order is already presupposed in this; such an idea can only come into being when opposing groups cannot negotiate with reference to different interpretations of the same shared Weltanschauung . But at this stage the process has not gone very far, since the particular conception still ultimately presupposes a common reality against which 'distortions' in the opponent's beliefs can be measured:</page><page sequence="5">POLITICS AND METHOD IN MANNHEIM 45 The particular conception of ideology therefore signifies a phenomenon intermediate between a simple lie at the one pole, and an error, which is the result of a distorted and faulty conceptual apparatus, at the other. (Mannheim 1936: 54) This notion of distortion is soon to disappear along with the idea of a common reality which supports it. The theory of ideology transcends this partiality and attains an historical consciousness (though not yet self-consciousness) when the 'total conception' of ideology comes into being. With the total conception Mannheim refers to a situation in which: We attempt to reconstruct the whole outlook of a social group, and neither the concrete individual nor the abstract sum of them can legitimately be considered as bearers of this ideological thought-system as a whole. (Mannheim 1936: 52) His most interesting observation here is that this process implies not merely a methodological but also an epistemological shift. In the particular conception an utterance is ideological if it does not correspond to a shared reality. This is possible because the critic of ideology does not call the opponent's beliefs into question in their totality. In questioning the totality of an opponent's beliefs the total conception is forced to concede the mind-dependent nature of all belief. With the emergence of the total conception of ideology we have the beginnings of the recognition of the perspectivai nature of belief as such: Henceforth the world as 'world' exists only with reference to the knowing mind, and the mental activity of the knowing subject determines the form in which the world appears. (Mannheim 1936: 58-59) The force of Mannheim's argument seems to indicate that he sees these epistemological shifts as cultural as well as intellectual phenomena. He seems to be driven by the anxiety that this incommensurability in thought may be associated with a situation in which social groups confront each other as opponents in totality. In this situation the participants have no common ground; they refuse to recognize the legitimacy of each other's beliefs (and by extension rights, interests, etc.). In such a case there is nothing to which the parties can both appeal which could act as a mediator between them. Society, modern society, becomes a potential battle-ground of opposing interest groups. This may sound like a rather forced reading of Ideology and Utopia , but it can be supported with reference to three types of evidence. Firstly, this can be done with reference to the historical conditions in which the work has written. Secondly, it can be done with reference to the author's views as they are expressed elsewhere. For example, Diagnosis of Our Time expresses such concerns clearly enough: Thus the machine age has either been incapable of producing adequate new values which would shape the process of work and leisure, or else is incapable of reconciling two different sets of competing ideals, both of which in their antagonism tend to disintegrate human character instead of integrating it. (Mannheim 1943: 20)</page><page sequence="6">46 A. SCOTT A third type of evidence comes from Ideology and Utopia itself, in the way Mannheim finds out of the intellectual dilemma he has identified in the theory of ideology. It is this third point which I wish to consider. The sociology of knowledge as cultural arbitrator Recognition of the world's mind-dependence is not enough for Mannheim; it is just another stage in the development of the theory of ideology. What is needed in addition is the recognition that the mind upon which the world is dependent is itself historically situated. But this realization is only partially attainable within the theory of ideology: The second stage in the development of the total conception of ideology is attained when the total but super-temporal notion of ideology is seen in historical perspective. (Mannheim 1936: 59) At this point the theory of ideology meets its own limitations. It started out with the simple motivation to criticize ever more radically the beliefs of opposing groups, but in the process the recognition of the historicity of all beliefs is increasingly and unavoidably forced upon it. What then has happened to its critical intent? Mannheim's argument here is dialectical in the sense that he traces, almost teleologically, the destruction of an idea through the development of its own internal contradictions. The closer the theory of ideology comes to realizing its potential, the larger looms its end. Historical consciousness, initially in the background, develops in this process but the original critical intent becomes more and more problematic. That only an underdeveloped theory of ideology can be used as a critical weapon is illustrated by a distinction Peter Winch draws in his discussion of cross-cultural understanding: It is important to distinguish a system of magical beliefs and practices like that of the Azande, which is one of the principal foundations of their whole social life and, on the other hand, magical rites that might be practised by persons belonging to our culture. (Winch 1970: 83-84) The point Winch is making here is close to Mannheim's: only in the latter case, where a shared background is assumed, can we criticize beliefs and practices (e.g., identify them as ideological in the pejorative sense). Where beliefs form a 'total ideology', as in the case of the Azande, we are no longer in a position to criticize as we lack a common standard. But, unlike Winch, Mannheim does not believe that such standards exist within our society either. For Mannheim, modernity means that groups within a single society can become as exotic to one another in their beliefs and practices as the Azande are to us all in Winch's account. This suggests that one way of formulating Mannheim's concerns is to say that they are similar to those surrounding the Winch debate in the late sixties and early seventies, only transferred from other forms of life to our own. Mannheim is</page><page sequence="7">POLITICS AND METHOD IN MANNHEIM 47 consistently sociological here: for him such problems of rationality or understanding are not problems as such, they are central sociological problems for industrial societies. As social problems they demand a solution, and the sociology of knowledge is Mannheim's solution. More specifically, it is the task of the sociology of knowledge to create conditions under which the opposing groups identified in the theory of ideology can once more be brought to communicate with each other: Once we recognize that all knowledge is relational knowledge, and can only be formulated with reference to the position of the observer, we are faced, once more, with the task of discriminating between what is true and what is false in such knowledge. The question then arises: which standpoint vis-à-vis of history offers the best chance for reaching an optimum of truth? (Mannheim 1936: 71) On Mannheim's account it is the sociology of knowledge which offers the way out of the dilemma in which the theory of ideology and its cultural counterpart (increased social differentiation) have placed us. The theory of ideology has made plain that there is no standpoint from which we can judge other beliefs to be ideological in their totality without implicating ourselves in the same charge: To-day, there are too many points of view of equal value and prestige, each showing the relativity of the other, to permit us to take any one position and to regard it as impregnable and absolute. (Mannheim 1936: 75) In recognizing this state of affairs the sociology of knowledge must renounce several central claims of the theory of ideology; the claim: (i) to have a direct access to reality /truth; (ii) to be an objective standpoint; (iii) that the beliefs of other groups are false (or true) in their totality; (iv) to represent a total Weltanschauung with a coherent picture of the world; (iv) to any a priori justification whether teleological, logical or epistemological. What alternative does this leave other than relativism? Essentially it leaves two methodological possibilities: firstly, a piecemeal approach to investigation and truth; secondly, a high degree of historical self consciousness, i.e., an awareness of the historicity of one's own standpoint. These basic guidelines for the 'historical investigator' Mannheim expresses as follows: As long as one does not call his own position into question but regards it as an absolute, while interpreting his opponents' ideas as a mere function of the social position they occupy, the decisive step forward has not yet been taken. (Mannheim 1936: 68) and: The modern investigator can answer, if he is accused of avoiding the problem of truth, that the indirect approach to truth through social history will in the end be more fruitful than the direct logical attack. Even though he does not discover 'truth itself, he will discover the cultural setting and many hitherto unknown 4 circumstances' which are relevant to the discovery of truth. (Mannheim 1936: 75)</page><page sequence="8">48 A. SCOTT So, again dialectically, the theory of ideology points to its own transcendence in the sociology of knowledge where problems are recast in order to be answered. But is there really a difference? Politics and method in ' Ideology and Utopia 9 So far it has been argued that for Mannheim the problem of truth arises with modernity and with the decline of old certainties and of a unified Weltanschauung. Philosophy, in the form of the theory of knowledge, has failed to rescue notions such as 'truth' and 'reason' from the theory of ideology and the cultural developments which it reflects. Rather than fight a rearguard battle against these developments, in the manner of epistemology, Mannheim hopes to rescue 'reason', 'truth' and the possibility of mutual understanding by following through the implications of these cultural/intellectual developments into their eventual transcen- dence. In the remaining part of this paper I want to discuss how Mannheim conceptualizes the sociology of knowledge, and why he identifies it as a possible solution to the intellectual and political problems of modernity. The connection between modernity and the sociology of knowledge has been noted by A. P. Simonds (1978) in his thorough interpretation of Mannheim's work: It was one of Mannheim's most frequently reiterated convictions that the problem of cross- cultural communication has become increasingly severe in the modern period.... This is the situation which makes a sociology of knowledge necessary; indeed, it is only this situation, for 'as long as discussion proceeds from the same basis of thought, and within the same universe of discourse, it [the sociology of knowledge] is unnecessary' . (Simonds 1978: 76 -II)1 Simonds' aim is to place Mannheim's sociology of knowledge within the hermeneutic tradition and to show how it is in line with developments within this style of thought, as well as with 'Anglo-Saxon' philosophy closer to hermeneu- tics(8). There is much in this interpretation with which I would agree. However, in stressing the hermeneutic strain Simonds distracts attention away from the nature of Mannheim's solution to the problem of cross-contextual communication. This solution is essentially methodological and this, as Bauman(1978) also notes, introduces a tension between strict hermeneutics and the sociology of knowledge. I shall draw out some of the methodological characteristics of the Mannheimian solution to the problem of cross-contextual communication between groups in modern society. 1 . Sociological inquiry and truth Mannheim's intentions in Ideology and Utopia are neither relativistic nor debunking: The attempt to escape ideological and Utopian distortions is, in the last analysis, a quest for reality. (Mannheim 1936: 87)</page><page sequence="9">POLITICS AND METHOD IN MANNHEIM 49 Ascribing relativist and debunking intentions to Mannheim serves only to obscure this, the most fundamental, feature of his argument: the 'quest for reality' through detailed socio-historical analysis. As recent commentators have noted, at this point his intellectual and his political concerns coincide: Once Mannheim decided that the conduct of everyday life is oriented by destructive delusions, at least in certain historical epochs, then the vocation of the seeker for knowledge once more appears simply and perhaps hopelessly as the task of Enlightenment. (Kettler, Meja and Stehr 1984: 76) Mannheim's dilemma is similar to that faced by the philosophy of science: 'How do we rescue notions such as truth, the accumulation of knowledge, commensurabil- ity, etc., once the conventional nature of scientific theories (or, in Mannheim's case, Weltanschauungen) has been recognized?' Relativism is the starting point of Mannheim's sociology of knowledge, not its conclusion. This relativism is forced on him, and us, externally by the proliferation of total ideologies in the modern period. We can see Mannheim's reluctance to draw relativistic conclusions from this state of affairs more clearly if we contrast his views with the conclusions drawn by Rorty from, as we saw earlier, similar arguments. Rorty is quite willing to draw 'relativist' conclusions: [Philosophy] is a cultural genre, a 'voice in the conversation of mankind' (to use Michael Oakeshott's phrase), which centres on one topic rather than another at some given time not by dialectical necessity but as the result of various things happening elsewhere in the conversation. (Rorty 1979: 264) Mannheim, in contrast, is not willing to say this of the sociology of knowledge. To take up the metaphor of conversation: the sociologist is not just one more partner in the conversation who throws in his/her lot with politicians, poets and activists; he/ she has a methodology, and this gives an added authority to the historical investigator. That the sociologist has a privileged place in the conversation is illustrated by the distinction between 'ideology' and 'utopia' itself. If we take the list of possible co- partners given above, the politician is probably an ideologist because he/she has a vested interest in stressing the limits to change ( Sachzwang - force of circumstances - was one of Helmut Schmidt's favourite terms), while the poet and the activist are probably Utopians. But what is the special contribution the historical investigator has to make in the quest for reality? Mannheim's view here is that once we have given up the hope of absolute truth, there remains the possibility of a synthesis of what is true in existing ideologies. Indeed it is recognition of the relativity of belief which opened up this possibility to us. Because of his/her historical sensibility and self-reflection, the sociologist is in a special position vis-à-vis the project: The present situation provides still another possibility. It rests, so to speak, on the reverse side of the fundamentally partisan character of political orientation. This alternative.... con- sists in the following: not only the necessary partisan character of every form of political knowledge is recognized, but also the peculiar character of each variety. It has become incontrovertibly clear to-day that all knowledge which is either political or which involves a world-view, is inevitably partisan. The fragmented character of all knowledge is clearly</page><page sequence="10">50 A. SCOTT recognizable. But this implies the possibility of an integration of many complementary points of view into a comprehensive whole. (Mannheim 1936: 132) There would seem to be a contradiction here. If these partisan views are total ideologies, as is implied in Mannheim's developmental model, how can we hope for synthesis? He makes the argument that critique presupposes common standards, but contradicts what would appear to be the logical extension of this view: that synthesis too presupposes such standards. If modernity robs us of the preconditions of critique, why does it not also rob us of the preconditions of synthesis? Nevertheless, his hope is for an integration of conflicting views into a new, but always provisional, totality. This is to be achieved through close historical investigation rather than abstract speculation or ideological synthesis. In other words, the sociology of knowledge is the major alternative to both epistemology and the theory of ideology in the quest for reality. 2. Politics beyond ideology and utopia Ideology and Utopia is an intervention in a political as well as an intellectual issue. This suggests that the work itself implies a politics as well as a method, or perhaps that the method is itself a politics. Some indication as to what this politics might be can be found in a distinction Mannheim draws between 'absolute' (or 'permanent') synthesis and 'dynamic' synthesis. Absolute synthesis, he says, is intellectualistic, while dynamic synthesis aims at an open-ended reconciliation: It [political sociology] may be built either upon quite one-sided perspectives reflecting the inter-relations of events as a given political party sees them, or it may appear in its most advanced form - as a constantly renewed attempt at synthesis of all the existent perspectives aiming at a dynamic reconciliation. (Mannheim 1936: 152) To achieve this Mannheim's historical investigator has to renounce partial political/ideological partisanship. Indeed he is quite explicit here: Even though the observer be a participant in the struggle, the basis of his thinking, i.e. his observational apparatus and his method of settling intellectual differences, must be above the conflict. (Mannheim 1936: 104) This distinction between absolute and dynamic synthesis, plus the view that the latter relies upon a bracketing of political and ideological partiality, indicates that Mannheim's hopes for the sociology of knowledge (or scientific politics) ultimately rest on a faith in their possible objectivity. This consideration indicates Mannheim's ultimate concern: the attempt to substitute sociology for epistemology as the cultural arbitrator of the modern age. It is no longer the epistemologist working from first principles, but the historical investigator, who has ousted religion in its role as a potentially unifying Weltanschauung. The means have altered, but the end remains the same. Here again Mannheim seems to be contradicting his own arguments: if the world has moved beyond the point at which epistemological reconciliation is possible, how is it that sociological synthesis is still possible? Mannheim never</page><page sequence="11">POLITICS AND METHOD IN MANNHEIM 5 1 answers this question, and the possibility of a dynamic synthesis remains an abstract wish. There are further problems with this notion of sociology-as-cultural-arbitrator. Firstly, there is the issue raised by Habermas with respect to Popper (Habermas 1971 and 1976) and again by Brian Fay (1975) of the elevation of the specialist to an arbitrating position introducing the spectre of a further erosion of the public sphere and the citizens' right to participation in 'discursive will formation'. Both Habermas and Fay stress that this notion of the expert-cum-arbitrator is internally related to a social-engineering conception of politics. In this sense there is perhaps a greater degree of continuity between Mannheim's sociology of knowledge and his later concern with social planning than some commentators suggest,9 and this shift of focus is not merely to be explained with reference to change of country and intellectual climate. As Bauman (1976) notes, this conception of the social scientist as expert raises questions of the 'vindication' of social-scientific claims. The argument here is that such claims are not merely to be vindicated within the intellectual community, but must also be checked against the reaction of the (social) 'object' of the inquiry. This can only occur when that 'object' is recognized as a co- subject to whom specialist arguments are communicated.10 Mannheim's elevation of the historical investigator to arbitrator (and hence above such discussions within the wider community) renders this process problematic. But beyond these broader issues, Mannheim's conception of the sociology of knowledge is problematic in its own terms. His notion seems to be as 'Utopian' in the critical sense as the positions it seeks to replace. It presupposes in the first place a high degree of consensus, or at least the possibility of a high degree of consensus, within the social-scientific community. The rifts which appear in society cannot be reproduced within the community of investigators. The recent, indeed the entire, history of the social sciences would seem to contradict this picture. Attempts, such as Weber's, to assert a division between politics and sociology as vocations (Gerth and Mills 1970) have been notoriously unsuccessful. For Mannheim this is a reflection of their immaturity, but it is by no means clear whether this argument can be maintained except with recourse to scientistic formulations which contradict Mannheim's own strict division between cultural and natural science (Bauman 1978: ch. 4, Simonds 1978). Mannheim's notion of reconciliation through dynamic synthesis is Utopian also in a sociological sense. It assumes that conflicts between groups can be reduced to conflict between ideas, between different pictures of the world. Thus conflicts based upon differences of interest which go beyond the possibility of intellectual synthesis are excluded a priori from the dynamic synthesis of a sociology of knowledge. As David Frisby notes: Mannheim sees the harmonization of conflicting class positions and polarized political ideologies as a possibility even in the later period of the Weimar republic. (Frisby 1983: 161) But just as the proliferation of competing ideologies indicated, as Mannheim stresses, irreconcilable differences of outlook, so it may also be taken as evidence of equally intractable material differences of interest. This final point brings us back to the question of the politics of Ideology and Utopia. Mannheim's arguments presuppose a distinction between ideology and</page><page sequence="12">52 A. SCOTT method . But, it seems reasonable to ask, can method not itself be, or at least imply, a political ideology? The idea of reconciliation between conflicting interests, the prominence given to the role of the specialist, and above all the notion of social planning perhaps implied in this (and explicit elsewhere in Mannheim (1944, 1950) do seem to have at least an 'elective affinity' with one particular political ideology: centrist, or centre-right, social democracy.11 If Mannheim's own proposals are themselves the stuff of ideologies and utopias then the project as a whole fails. The sociology of knowledge becomes after all just another 'cultural genre' which must compete on an equal footing for our attention in an already noisy and lively conversation. Final remarks The common criticism that Mannheim failed to develop the implications of the sociology of knowledge to the full but retained elements from epistemology (Bloor 1976, Barnes 1977) may be explained in terms of his basic political attitude and intent. Given his purpose of intervening with a solution to what he saw as the central problem of modernity, it was never his intention to develop a 'strong programme' for the sociology of knowledge. Indeed it could not have been, since for him the sociology of knowledge was all along meant to serve rationalist ends. Martin Jay captures this very well when he writes of the Frankfurt School's critique: They attribute to Mannheim a relativism that is the exact opposite of the absolutism for which Horkheimer had chastised him in his 1930 essay: 'A New Concept of Ideology'. And in so doing, it seems to me, they are far less accurate in their description of Mannheim's intentions than Horkheimer had been. (Jay 1974: 87) Similarly Bauman' s observation that there is a conflict between Mannheim as hermeneutic theorist and Geisteswissenschaftler on the one hand, and his sociology of knowledge with its positivist leanings on the other, also seems to have its origin in the politics of Ideology and Utopia and his other works (Bauman 1978, ch. 4; see also Frisby 1983: 118- 119). To establish a sociology-as-cultural-arbitrator Mannheim is forced to resort to positivist and rationalist formulations, otherwise he would be led by the force of his own argument to abandon notions of method-based privilege for the sociological intervention into cultural debates. Whatever the problems with Mannheim's arguments, the recognition of their political context in some sense makes them more contemporary than were he merely working out a sub-discipline within sociology. After all, if the recent work of Habermas and the debate which surrounds it is a reasonable indicator, the attempt to deal with problems of modernity through a sociological reconstruction of the concept of rationality, ultimately Mannheim's aim, is hardly a dead issue within the social sciences. Notes *1 would particularly like to thank Ahmed Gurnah, Mark Schultz and Brigitte Scott for their constructive comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper. I am also grateful to two anonymous referees for their further comments.</page><page sequence="13">POLITICS AND METHOD IN MANNHEIM 53 1. Barnes (1977) also makes such criticisms of Mannheim and takes him to task for his 'failure' to develop the full implications of the sociology of knowledge as Barnes sees them. 2. Popper (1944, ch. 22) makes the philosophical arguments against Mannheim which are repeated elsewhere (e.g. Härtung 1970). But some sociological critics have also made basic logical criticisms. For example, Abercrombie and Longhurst (1983) demand a more exact account of the relationship between beliefs and the social situation of the group to which they are imputed when they remark that Mannheim does not adequately answer the question: ' "why those ideas and not some other oppositional set" ' (1 1). This strikes me as a highly philosophical (even essentialist) question since it demands of any sociological explanation that it provide necessary and sufficient conditions of the relationship between social phenomena. It is not clear whether any sociological explanation could ever fulfil this demand. 3. Skinner writes: The essential question which we therefore confront, in studying any given text, is what its author, in writing at the time he did write for the audience he intended to address, could in practice have intended to communicate by the utterance of this given utterance' (Skinner 1969: 48-49). 4. Lukács 1968, especially pp.110- 131. 5. Mannheim 1936, especially pp.70- 71: 'Relativism, then, owes its existence to the discrepancy between this newly-won insight into the actual process of thought and the theory of knowledge which has not yet taken account of this new insight' (70). Rorty makes a similar point: 'Nobody would want "human knowledge" (as opposed to some particular theory or report) justified unless he had been frightened by scepticism' (Rorty 1979: 229). 6. Jay (1970) is particularly informative on the intellectual background to the sociology of knowledge. He brings out the points at issue between the Frankfurt School and Mannheim while showing a high degree of common concern. 7. The quotation in this passage is from Mannheim 1936, p. 252. 8. A clear account of this shifting relationship between hermeneutics and 'Anglo-Saxon' linguistic philosophy can be found in Bernstein 1976. 9. For example, Abercrombie and Longhurst 1983. 10. The most elaborate formulation of the argument that social sciences deal with a subject/ object of investigation and are thus to be vindicated in ways qualitatively different from natural science is made by Karl-Otto Apel 1980. David Frisby, co-translator of Towards the Transformation of Philosophy , sees close parallels between Mannheim and Apel on these issues (Frisby 1983, p. 119 and p. 124). This interpretation is vindicated in the recently translated manuscripts published as Structures of Thinking where Mannheim writes:' . . . it is only man as he has been socialized who is able to pursue, understand, and test cultural sociology. While natural scientific knowledge presents itself so that, at least in principle, it abstracts from all anthropomorphic reference..., cultural sociology wants to involve man, not only as creaturely, corporeal being as such, but also as social subject, and it must do so. The socialized individual is knowing subject as well as subject matter of sociology.' (Mannheim 1982: 75). 11. For an account of Mannheim's political views, see Kettler, Meja and Stehr 1984, Ch.l.
