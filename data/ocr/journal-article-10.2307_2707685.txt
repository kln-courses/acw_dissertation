<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM EQUALITY TO ORGANICISM BY FRANK E. MANUEL One of the crucial developments in modern intellectual history is the reversal from the eighteenth-century view of men as more or less equal, or at least similar, in nature and hence in rights, to the early nineteenth-century emphasis upon human uniqueness, diversity, dis- similarity, culminating in theories of inequality and organicism. It is the purpose of this paper to trace the transition in representative French thinkers from Rousseau and Helvetius and Condorcet through Cabanis, Bichat, de Bonald, and Saint-Simon, punctuating the novel elements introduced into the general climate of opinion. The majority of eighteenth-century moralists derived from the Lockian postulate that differences among mature men as they were observable in society were the direct consequence of early education and the play of individual circumstances and experiences. While conceding that gross physical defects at birth might account for cases of monstrous intellectual deformity, it was an article of faith that, apart from such exceptions, all men were born free and equal and were molded into somewhat different shapes by their environment. The very posing of the question by the Dijon Academy in 1753- " What is the origin of inequality among men, and is it authorized by natural law? "-which Rousseau answered with his thunderous dis- course, implied that inequality was a phenomenon in the history of man which had to justify itself and had to be explained. Though Rousseau's brief commentary on natural and unnatural inequalities, like many of his theses, could be developed in a number of contrary directions, the moral drawn by contemporaries from the total work was clear and simple: men were once equal in the state of nature and they could be at least semblances of real men in their unfortunate present social state only insofar as they remained more or less equal. Otherwise they became slaves and corrupt lackeys. This was the way revolutionaries read his writing and in this form its message was embodied in the great American and French political documents. The eighteenth-century theorists were almost unanimous in their acceptance of the psychological principle that all men were equal in their natural faculties, hence in their capacity to receive impressions of the external world; and if they were given identical educations they would all have the same rational concepts.' Essentially the capacity to receive impressions was, had been, and was likely to be the same at all times and in all places among all men. On the problem of whether men were really identical-not merely "Quintilian, Locke, and I say: Inequality among intellects is the result of a known cause and this cause is the difference in education." C. A. Helvetius, De l'Homme (1772), in Oeuvres completes (Paris, 1818), II, 71. 54</page><page sequence="2">FROM EQUALITY TO ORGANICISM 55 similar-in the strength of their organs, the French followers of Locke, such as Helvetius and Condillac, came pretty close to a theory of absolute equivalence at birth, while Rousseau's distinction between natural and unnatural inequalities early in the Second Discourse seemed to imply a contradictory theory, that there were substantial natural inequalities, based on health, bodily strength, and powers of the intellect and the soul.2 However, the overall reading of the Dis- course makes it abundantly evident that even the natural inequalities are natural and significant only in the present civilized state of society. In the early scenes of the idyllic state of nature the primitive savages were not remarkably distinguished from one another in physical or mental prowess; the natural differences so striking in society were really the consequences of the corruption and decadence of a substantial portion of the human species under the vicious in- fluences of the societal state. The process of civilization, in other words, had by now introduced inequalities at birth which originally, in the state of nature, were not there-or at least were minimal. It is difficult to discern natural inequalities among Rousseau's torpid savages who wake from time to time to eat an acorn or copulate with a woman. Thus in Rousseau one can distinguish few if any natural inequalities in the state of nature; these increase in number in the state of civilization; and soon even they are overwhelmed by the flood of inequalities which he designated as unnatural, primarily inequalities of wealth and status and power. La Nouvelle Heloise was the century's most passionate plea for the right of all men to love, and the Contrat Social, whatever germs of absolutism recent critics have discovered in its pages, was in its day a proclamation of the principle of equality in the social state. All philosophes were agreed in allowing men equality of natural civil rights, though they might differ about their precise definition. Few philosophes went so far as to posit equality in wealth and property as a natural and necessary form of equality. While Morelly, Brissot de Warville, and a minority Qf radicals did adopt the extreme view that since property did not exist in the state of nature, it was theft and had to be abolished in society,3 the overwhelming body of opinion took the position that the maintenance of civilization re- quired the preservation of inequalities of wealth and perhaps even of social status in order to make man who was by nature indolent sub- 2Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract and Discourses, translated by G.

This was Voltaire's viewpoint in his paradoxical article on Equality in the Philosophical Dictionary; and this was the attitude of the economists who wrote about the new laws of true political economy. Even Voltaire, however, who was no sufferer of the pretensions of cooks and lackeys, held to the theory that " all men are equal in the possession of their natural faculties " and agreed that inequalities of wealth had probably been exaggerated in contemporary society.4 Condorcet made the establishment and preservation of " absolute equality," by which he meant equality in law, the heart of his Declaration des Droits pamphlet published in 1789; 5 moreover, he was fully aware that his constitution might ultimately result in juridical "inequality in fact" unless society instituted measures to render men more or less equal in other respects. This is the dominant spirit of his final testament. The Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progres de l'esprit humain, in which the ideology of the French eighteenth century found its climactic expression, exalted equality as the primary aspiration of the human spirit, a goal to which mankind was inevitably progressing. Though absolute equality might never be attained, the essence of progress was the movement towards a social state in which all nations on earth and all individuals within these nations approached as near as possible to a status of equality, material, moral, and intellectual.6 If the universal "social art" properly fulfilled its function, all men would really become capable of enjoying a more or less equivalent level of prosperity, for there was no basis in nature for such extreme variations of man's estate as the condition of barbarism, of a colonial master's opulence, and of the pauperized lower classes of European civilized society. The unique quality of genius and the problem of his role in society was perhaps the one disturbing element in the calm of this egalitarian conception. Condorcet and other philosophes before him had indeed wrestled with that anomalous-to Diderot almost demoniac-character who gave impetus to the progress of the whole species. Like the deformed monster at the other end of the scale, genius was a flagrant violation of the idea of natural equality. And yet the future ascendancy of man depended so heavily upon him, upon his creativity, his discoveries. In his commentary on Bacon's New Atlantis, Condorcet solved the dilemma of genius by placing 4F. M. A. de Voltaire, Dictionnaire philosophique, in Oeuvres (Paris, 1835), VII, 473-475. 5 M. J. A. N.

Beneath the scientists who were philosopher-kings all others were about equal. Despite the apotheosis of the scientists, general equality of the human condition persists as the ultimate social end, for the new in- ventions and the new social laws, created by the scientists and em- bodied in legislation, tend to eradicate the twin plagues of misery and ignorance, universalizing rational behavior, drawing the whole of mankind up the mountain, ever closer behind the vanguard of scientists who are eternally forging ahead. In each succeeding generation, as the mass of mankind approach nearer to equality with one another, they are simultaneously raised from one plateau of scientific and moral excellence to another. This is the true progress of the human spirit: the virtual achievement of that equality in rationality of which men are capable. But however pervasive the egalitarian ideal, the final reflection is inescapable that the dramatic recognition of the natural superiority of genius does leave the portals open for the antinomic idea of inequality and the construction of an elitist theory. While the Declaration of the Rights of Man did not adopt a philosophical position on the nature of human equality and explicitly limited itself to the pronouncement that " Men are born and always continue free and equal in respect of their rights" [italics mine], loudly trumpeted egalitarian slogans became a vital, intrinsic part of the revolutionary myth. As the Revolution progressed many variations on the theme of natural equality were sounded. The most notorious, perhaps, was Babeuf, who in the name of Rousseau proclaimed in his Manifesto that men had to be equal in property even as they were equal in the natural enjoyment of the sun in order to be truly free. Among the enrages and the lunatic fringe of Jacobinism, equality in the possession of women was included on occasion in a latitudinarian interpretation of the natural rights doctrine founded upon an affirma- tion of man's polygamous nature. However sharp the divergences in tone and temper, extremists and sober citizens alike defined the issue in the same terms-how equal were men by nature and how equal should they be in society- and always resolved it in the general direction of equality. For all the justifications of wealth and bourgeois declamations against the 7 Condorcet, Fragment sur l'Atlantide, ou efforts combines de l'espece humaine pour le progres des sciences, in Oeuvres, VI, 597-660.</page><page sequence="5">58 FRANK E. MANUEL sloth of the canaille, there was a widespread consciousness at the height of the Revolution that men were interchangeable in most of their social roles. Property restrictions excluded some men from the status of active citizens even after the abolition of all other distinc- tions of class and occupation, but all men were capable of attaining that status by the acquisition of a minimal amount of property. Uniform costumes and uniform laws were imposed by the Revolution, enduring symbols of equality. The new political society offered equality of civil rights and through its educational system it was opening up the avenues of equality of opportunity. The Spartan ideal of continence made conspicuous display of wealth suspect. True Jacobins were in fact becoming more or less equal in dress, in con- sumption, in devotion and service to the state. Strangely enough, the volte-face from an emphasis on man's potential, if not actual, equality, both of knowledge and of condition, to the acceptance of human inequality as the cornerstone of the good society, was executed in the very heat of the revolutionary turmoil. A cogent expression of the idea of inequality can be found in a passage of a National Assembly committee report, prepared by Talleyrand, in which an analogy is drawn between a well-organized state and a great national workshop.8 The image, which he could well have derived from any number of economists of the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries, was doubtless nourished by the realities of English and French industrialization. The novelty lies in its in- corporation into a government report on education. Men are born with a variety of different faculties, Talleyrand asserted-the Lockian concept is banished-and these diverse faculties lie dormant until the national system of education comes along and arouses them. A wise educational system takes cognizance of the differences among men and fosters the development of special faculties. The real secret of the social art is the placement of individual men in the most ap- propriate positions in the national workshop in accordance with their native talents.9 The analogy of the workshop, which presumes ac- ceptance of the Smithian idea of the division of labor, involved a new emphasis on the dissimilarities among individual men and on their natural inequalities, which it became salutary to preserve. Within a few years after the publication of Talleyrand's report with its stress on the creation of schools and institutes for the edu- cation of specialists in all branches of knowledge, the ideologue scientists who took possession of French thought under the Direc- torate drew attention to another aspect of inequality, the broad 8D.

Their ul- timate goal remained the egalitarian society unveiled by Condorcet, but the new medicine was leading the ideologues to momentous philosophical conclusions about the nature of man. The intellectual revolution was generated not so much by the discovery of hitherto unknown scientific data as by a new interpretation of empirical facts which doctors and life scientists had been accumulating over the century. In the Years IV and V Doctor Cabanis read before the Class of Moral and Political Sciences of the Institute a series of papers on the interconnections between man's physical and moral being, in the course of which he developed a complete typology of character, as well as a series of generalizations on how men were affected by differ- ences in sex, age, temperament, states of morbidity, regimen, and climate. He concluded that even rational men did not behave the same way at all stages of life, that their minds showed not minor but substantial differences in performance when assailed by crisis in their sexual nature, by illness, by senescence. Different men seemed to react differently to crucial transformations in human nature dur- ing the course of the life cycle. The emphasis throughout was on the physiological and psychological variations among men, not their similarities, which the legislator would have to take into considera- tion.l0 Cabanis here modified the sensationalism of Locke, Helvetius, and Condillac at its very source, their presupposition that in general all human beings received identical impressions from nature. This simply was not in accord with his experience, the Doctor found. The differences in sensory perception among men were greater than their similarities and gave rise to "different turns of mind and soul." 11 The subject of inquiry was not a Condillac statue which was endowed with the capacity to feel, but men living in different climates, men with different native temperaments, obeying different patterns of conduct, men subject to the exigencies of sexual change, age, and 10 " When one compares one man with another, one sees that nature has set up among individuals differences which are analogous to and correspond in a certain sense to those which can be recognized among species." P. J. G. Cabanis, "De l'influence des temperamens sur la formation des idees et des affections morales," in Memoires de l'Institut de France, Academie des sciences morales et politiques, 1lre serie, II, 230. 11 " But the impressions which the same objects make on us do not always have the same degree of intensity and are not always of the same duration. Sometimes they glide by hardly exciting our attention; sometimes they captivate it with an irresistible force and leave behind profound traces. Surely men do not resemble each other in their manner of feeling."

MANUEL sickness. There was no " type common to the whole human species." The doctors whom Cabanis quoted were dwelling upon the fact that men were born physiologically unequal, that the organs of their patients were far from being equally strong, that different patients reacted in diverse ways to the same doses of drug. The scientific study of pathological conditions of the body and Pinel's pioneer in- quiries into the nature of madness, free from religious prejudice, were revealing wide disparities in human reactivity and capacity. Cabanis's psychology, anchored in the accumulation of physiological data and medical experience, cast a powerful light upon the dis- similarities among men and broke with the philosophical psychology of Helvetius and Condillac which in the previous generation had served as " scientific " underpinnings for the doctrine of equality.l2 Since the Condorcet ideal of equality was still dominant, his friend Cabanis was studying human distinctions with the lodestar of a perfected Man before his mind's eye. The purpose of medicine as he conceived it was not restricted to curing individual ailments; its higher objective was the perfection of the species.13 The study of natural human frailties or inferiorities should lead to their elimina- tion through time, a feasible prospect since he firmly believed that acquired characteristics were inherited.14 Cabanis still had an eighteenth-century faith in the extraordinary malleability of human nature and his aim in focussing upon congenital and environmental differences was not to utilize distinctions as Talleyrand wished but to narrow their range. He studied human pathology in order to make men equally healthy and rational and he trusted in the power of science to achieve the general perfection of the human species. Nonetheless, ideologue psychology was turning sharply away from Master Locke when it took to studying distinctions-it was a momentous departure. The same interest in the investigation of disparities was rein- forced by numerous lesser eighteenth and early nineteenth century researches in physiognomy and phrenology, divergent as were the 12 Cabanis wrote that his admiration for Helvetius and Condillac did not pre- vent him from recognizing that "both of them lacked physiological knowledge, from which their works could have significantly profited." If Helvetius had known the "animal economy" better, he could not have "maintained his system of the equality of intellects."

The mystical and astrological elements which sometimes were intermingled with these character studies only served to widen the breach between them and the common sense in- terpretation of human differences upon which Helvetius had insisted to the rigid exclusion of occult influences and vague concepts such as humors and tempers. A key figure expressive of the new scientific attitude towards human nature was the physiologist Bichat, whose works were known throughout the civilized world at the turn of the century. In his Physiological Researches upon Life and Death he divided men into three physiological categories. While such classifications had been made often enough before in antiquity and in early modern times on the basis of dominant humors and temperaments, the importance of Bichat lies in the fact that his writings were picked up and read by one of the seminal social theorists of the age, Henri de Saint-Simon. And it was in the form expounded by Bichat that the physiological doctrine of inequality first penetrated social theory and became part of a new general conception of the nature of man and society. Bichat distinguished among three major types-a trinary division has always communicated itself most readily in western society-a brain man, a sensory man, and a motor man. In each type one par- ticular dominant faculty was capable of great development, while the other two were destined to remain feeble.17 Bichat's vitalist theory allowed for only a given quantum of energy in each individual; and no man, with the rarest of exceptions, could develop all three major faculties to an equivalent degree. Physiologically men were born limited and restricted-either brain, or sensory, or motor-and vital energy invariably tended to channel itself into one receptacle rather than the two others.18 The consequences of this theory for education and human progress, if accepted as a new definition of human nature, are mani- 15 The classical work of Johann Caspar Lavater (1741-1801) was his Physiogno- mische Fragmente zur Befoerderung der Menschenkenntniss und Menschenliebe (Leipzig, 1775-1778), 4 vols. 16 Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828) wrote Recherches sur l'anatomie du systeme nerveux en general et du cerveau en particulier (Paris, 1809). 17 Xavier Bichat, Physiological Researches upon Life and Death, translated by Tobias Watkins (Philadelphia, 1809), 112-113. The work was originally published in France in the Year VIII (1799-1800). 1 " You will seldom or never see the perfection of action in the locomotive organs co-incident with those of the brain or the senses, and on the other hand it is extremely rare to find the former very apt in their respective functions when the latter possess considerable energy in their's."

Cabanis had still concentrated upon the flexibility and easy educability of any human trait through laws and medicine; Bichat's iron law of physiology dictated that only one of the major capacities could and should be trained. It was the responsibility of society to identify a man's major faculty and to develop it to the uttermost limits of his capacity, to the negligence of the other two faculties, since it was futile to attempt to fashion what was not by nature educable. Perfectibility lay not in an identical Spartan education for all men, but in the stimulation of uniqueness, in specialization. This led to the conception of an organic society based upon differenti- ated functions. The physiological theory of inequality merged at the turn of the century with elements which for want of a better term one must still call Romantic-the new emphasis on the "genesis" of national character as revealed by Herder, the new image of the unique per- sonality as drawn by Goethe and Senancour, the general climate of opinion that fostered a new sensibility for diversity and plenitude rather than universality and oneness. The Romantic spirit became so all-pervasive that it is pointless to relate its diffusion to individual poets or philosophers. It dis- covered a new man with a complexity, with expansive dimensions which the popular theorists of the previous generation had not dreamed of. Man was capable of an acuteness, a variety of sensa- tions, and an extravagance of behavior which the rationalist egalitarians of the eighteenth century would have curtly dismissed as an aberration of nature. Men can have equality in reason, par- ticularly if, as with Turgot and Condorcet, there lies ahead the pros- pect of a complete mathematicization of all knowledge; but if the floodgates of emotion are opened and men become religious mystics, poet-seers, if they delve into the lower depths of their bestiality and ascend the heights of the ethereal, if they roam the world in search of new feeling in exotic lands, if they resurrect all past history to find new colors and forms of expression, the abstraction of virtuous men behaving in more or less similar fashion in accordance with the dictates of their equivalent, enlightened natures becomes a lifeless scarecrow. Romanticism cannot abide the philosophe's image of egalitarianism either as a description of man's inner nature or as a future ideal. The early identification of the romantic poets with the philosophical theocratic reaction was not fortuitous-they had a common abhorrence for the philosophe's man of universal, facile reason, so self-evident and so readily accessible to all in equal portions. The eighteenth-century philosophe turned his head away from the monster with repugnance; Romanticism made him its hero.</page><page sequence="10">FROM EQUALITY TO ORGANICISM 63 The idea of natural equality could not survive in a Romantic world of convulsion and prodigy. The impact of the French Revolution upon the philosophical minds of Europe is the most potent political factor in the repudiation of the concept of equality. It was not necessary that the Revolution become a personal trauma, as it was for men like Saint-Simon and Fourier (both imprisoned by the Jacobins) and for the emigres, to make men recoil with revulsion and fear before the bloody deeds of the Terror. The identification of the chaos and sheer destructive- ness of the Revolution with the ideology of the philosophes had been made by Edmund Burke in the early years of the Revolution and his thesis had swept the continent. Egalitarianism had been a central proposition in the armory of the "literary cabal "; the revolution- aries had paraded Egalite upon their banners, the enrages among the sans-culottes had propounded doctrines and suggested conduct in the name of equality which profoundly shocked the sensibilities of Christian Europe. Equality was an explosive idea which had in- flamed the Paris mobs with a violent passion and had implanted illusory hopes in the breasts of "ignorant proletarians." Equality had brought European society to the brink of annihilation. To consider the idea of equality-however it was interpreted-as a dangerous heresy was the instinctive reaction of the conservative thinkers of the continent, and its extirpation became a spiritual necessity for anti-revolutionary theorists of every stripe. Burke's invective against the levelling spirit had sounded the clarion call to battle against the "barbarous philosophy" of the equals. In 1793 when Necker in exile sat down to contemplate the meaning of the Revolution in which he had been a major actor, one of his first proj- ects was the writing of Reflexions philosophiques sur l'Egalite.19 If man wished to associate himself with the spirit of the Divine Creation, he had to mirror in the social order he established the diversities of the natural order. " Inequalities in a state of harmony, that is the rule of the universe." 2 The concept of inequality as translated into political-religious terms by a group of traditionalists, foremost among them de Bonald and de Maistre, was a major new intellectual force in European thought. They created the image of an anthropomorphic medieval society as the last good society, in contrast with the conflict-ridden, atomistic, egalitarian eighteenth-century world whose bloody climax was the Terror. They revalued status, the virtues of the nobility, the corporations, and the jurands, and they conceived of the social 19 These reflections were later appended to Necker's De la Revolution Fran~oise (Paris, 1797), 2 vols. 20Ibid., II, 116.</page><page sequence="11">64 FRANK E. MANUEL order as an organic unity. These men were polemicists of stature and they knew how to excoriate the preachers of equality with a vehemence, a subtlety, and a philosophic universality which no Christian apologist had achieved in more than a century. The theocratic school was less absorbed in attacking the scientific valid- ity of the idea of natural equality than in contrasting this " sterile " political conception with the Christian moral rules of behavior im- posed upon one man in his relations with his "neighbor," his "fellow-man," his "likeness." De Bonald stripped the idea of equality of that sense of human dignity which it had acquired among the philosophes and revealed it as a naked political relationship in contradiction to the Christian commandment of brotherly love.21 But while the spirit of the counter-revolution gave forceful im- petus to the anti-egalitarian onslaught, enemies of the abstract prin- ciple of equality had also sprung up in quarters which were far from hostile to the regime in France after Thermidor. Paradoxically enough, in the weakening of the ideal of equality there was a con- fluence of pressures from opposite directions, both from the atheistic doctors of the Institute-the ideologue scientists who were the official philosophers of the state until they were ousted by Napoleon-and from the emigre theocrats. Henri de Saint-Simon was influenced by all these waves of doctrine, perhaps most of all by Condorcet, Cabanis, Bichat, and the Tradi- tionalists-an odd assortment of antecedents for his organismic view of society rooted in the concept of natural inequalities. In Saint- Simon's doctrine the scientific elite of Condorcet, the findings of the new physiology of Bichat, the new psychology of Cabanis coalesced with an appreciation of the organic social order of the theocrats. Saint-Simon has one underlying preconception which is identical with the outlook of the philosophical egalitarians, the conviction that the ideal forms of the good society must be congruent with what is natural in man. From a cursory reading of the physiologists, however, Saint-Simon came away with a different version of the natural: the natural was inequality. He inveighed against philo- sophism for its ignorance of the simple physiological facts, positive scientific facts, which had since been set forth by Cabanis and Bichat. Confirmed in the belief that physiology was the only sound foun- dation upon which to construct a social theory, after numerous experiments with variant schema of social classification in the final phase of his thinking he devised a plan which was a direct adapta- 21 L.

This scientific capacity-the brain type- which he sometimes called the Aristotelian capacity, if given free play would fulfill the mission which Condorcet had proposed for the lead- ing scientific intellects. Bichat's motor capacity was transformed by Saint-Simon into the industrial class. In his latter days the term "industriels" was used to cover all men in whatever station in life who were engaged in production of material artifacts and their ex- change. In the same category he bracketed a whole range of in- dividuals from the director of a great industrial enterprise to its humblest manual laborer. Most of mankind, whose primary apti- tude was the motor capacity, were destined to remain manual labor- ers, though a small elite of this class with essentially the same kind of talent would become the administrators of the temporal affairs of society-the men who organized states and directed public works and engineered vast projects for the exploitation of nature. Saint- Simon's third class, which corresponded to Bichat's sensory man, were the artists, poets, religious leaders, ethical teachers, whom he sometimes identified with the Platonic capacity. In the last years of his life, when he emphasized the religious character of his doctrine, he endowed the sensory aptitude with special worth since he con- sidered it capable of overcoming the atomist, egotist, egalitarian propensities of the contemporary world in crisis. The men of senti- ment would give the new industrial society its quality and cohesive humanitarian spirit. The good society thus represented a harmonious association or cooperation of men fundamentally dissimilar in their most essential natures, organized in three natural classes. Together they embodied the total needs of mankind-rational scientific, manual adminis- trative, sensory religious. The eighteenth-century philosophes, even when they admitted human inequalities, had still insisted upon or- ganizing the state and society around those elements which men 22 While Saint-Simon was already struggling with this conception in the brilliant, though eccentric, fragments he wrote under the Empire, the full meaning of his organic conception of man and society did not emerge until after 1819, in L'Organ- isateur, Du systeme industriel, Catechisme des industriels, Opinions litteraires, philosophiques et industrielles, and the Nouveau Christianisme. 23The "immortal physiologist" Bichat was by Saint-Simon's own testimony the source of his conception of mutually exclusive capacities, a theory which in Du systeme industriel he called a law of human organization.

MANUEL had in common, their natural equalities and relatively equal capac- ity for governance and the holding of public office. Saint-Simon and all later organicist doctrines which derived from him may have taken for granted some of the equal rights of the philosophes, but they then proceeded to fashion society out of the different clays which were the raw materials of human nature. All men were not equally capable of participating in the administration of society. The new philosopher of society approached the whole problem with the initial preconception that the physiological and psychological differences of men were the very brick and mortar of his perfect social edifice. Fourier's theory of the passions, independently de- veloped with an almost compulsive detail and a mania for the multiplication of psychological types, is only an exaggeration of the same tendency. The order of the phalanstery is a harmony of prop- erly distributed human beings who perform social functions in ac- cordance with the requirements of their personality types. If mankind were organized on the basis of Saint-Simon's-or for that matter Fourier's-natural physiological classification, conflict and frustration would in time vanish from society. Historic con- flicts of previous ages had their origins in the fact that class stratifications were not natural, and were for the most part mere groupings of rival interest corps, competing for power over one another. Past history had witnessed the attempt of single classes to dominate the whole of society. This had been true even in the last relatively organic social epoch, the Middle Ages, when despite the universal veneration of Christ, the temporal and spiritual es- tates, nobility and clergy, were engaged in a death-struggle for the totality of power. As long as classes remained expressions of the lust for dominion, chaos would reign forever, there could be no peace and no social harmony. Under the new organic system of natural classes the lust for dominion would be transferred from men and directed against objects. With time the very nature of this power lust would undergo a metamorphosis.24 The presumption is overwhelming that each man seeks to express his own and not an alien nature, that he desires to live and work in the classification where he has natural endowments, be they Saint-Simon's scientific, administrative, and poetic capacities, or any one of Fourier's multifarious dominant passion types. Saint- Simon here adapted one of the major contentions of the theocrats, who steadfastly maintained that men were not driven by a passion for equality with other men of higher status or greater wealth, but 24 " The desire to command men has slowly transformed itself into the desire to make and remake nature in accordance with our will."

They wanted not equality but the expression of their true social natures. Saint-Simon merely translated this conception into scientific terms: men by nature de- sired not equality with others but the expression of their true social natures based upon their intrinsic and immutable physiological apti- tudes. The Aristotelian idea that every being seeks a fulfillment of its essential character or nature has found an echo both in the theocratic and in the Saint-Simonian theories. It is a dogma that no man would be so monstrous as to desire to exercise administra- tive functions if he were born with a scientific capacity. At least, no good social order would allow such an anarchic misplacement of human talent. When a man operates in a social class to which he does not naturally belong, he is wasting his own talents and reduc- ing the total creative potential of humanity. Among Saint-Simon's last words was a message to his favorite disciple that the quintes- sential goal of his new doctrine was the total development of human capacities and the arrangement of the social order so that these capa- cities might achieve their maximum realization.25 In the last analysis the validity of human life in an organic society derives not from the individual's relationship to his fellows, but from his relationship to the society as a whole. Inequalities of status and authority are as obvious as the physiological differ- ences among men, but they are justified in terms of the society's total organization and purpose. A rationale for these inequalities clearly emerges in Saint-Simon's ideal industrial-scientific regime, where power is transformed into function and privilege into responsibility. Saint-Simon's formula for the organization of society aims to eliminate the possibility of social maladjustment and friction. With- in each class of aptitudes, of capacities, the course is always kept open to talent. Here again there is the presumption that among men with similar or identical aptitudes, superiority and excellence will automatically be recognized without jealousy and without con- flict. Saint-Simon generalized to all aptitudes the apparent un- animity with which the foremost mathematicians, physicists, and biologists seemed to be appreciated by men of science. In the good society a natural elite corps (he was directly in- fluenced by the contemporary analogy of Napoleon's troupes d'elite), one with authentic, proved capacities, directed the various classes. Leadership was not, as the doctrine of popular sovereignty presupposed, a generalized capacity in which all men were more or 25 Notice historique, in Oeuvres, I, 122.</page><page sequence="15">68 FRANK E. MANUEL less equal and which made it feasible and natural for offices to be elective. In the organic society, workers instinctively rendered obedience to their natural superiors, their "chiefs," in their own class.26 The idealized image of the Napoleonic army, in which or- dinary soldiers had risen to be marshals, in which rank was at least in theory the reward of merit, was a prototype for Saint-Simon's civilian class society. Saint-Simon's anger against the nobility and the clergy, which he denounced as useless bodies of faineants, was fired far less by their exclusive character than by their decadence, his awareness that in reality they had ceased to be functioning elites within the body politic. Unique excellence and attributes, what he called anomalies, in the Middle Ages had been the very basis for the constitution of elite corps such as the nobility and the clergy. The egalitarian philosophes had made the fatal error of proclaiming the abolition of all specialized corps merely because the existing elites in name had ceased to be elites in fact. In the Saint-Simonian world out- look, organic inequality among men, inequality in the social hier- archy, and difference of social function were natural and beneficent, wholly superior to the egalite turque of the Jacobin revolutionaries which was an equality of slavery beneath an omnipotent state authority.7 Men who are born unequal in capacities require an organic society in which each is allotted a function "according to his capacity"-this is the true meaning of the famous slogan of the Saint-Simonian cult. The organismic society, unlike the atomist egalitarian society, which functions like inanimate clockwork, requires a "vitalst" element-some pervasive emotion, feeling, or belief to give life to the organic body. Though the eighteenth century had developed the concepts of benevolence and humanity as characteristics of natural men of virtue, Saint-Simon in the romantic temper infused the idea of the love of humanity with an emotional drive which it had lacked in the minds of the philosophes. Love was the fluid which coursed through the body social, gave it movement and energy. In Saint-Simon's judgment the equal atoms of the eighteenth-century world view were always on the verge of strife; his ideal of love created an organic harmonious whole out of society's vital parts. Men hungered for this comfort on the morrow of a quarter of a 26 The idea of the natural elite was developed by Saint-Simon in L'Industrie (1817), in Oeuvres, XVIII, 142-145. The same conception had been adumbrated earlier in the fragment entitled "Sur la capacite de l'Empereur," in the Intro- duction aux travaux scientifiques du xixe siecle (Paris, 1808), 2 vols. 27 Saint-Simon, Du systeme industriel, in Oeuvres, XXII, 17 f. n.</page><page sequence="16">FROM EQUALITY TO ORGANICISM 69 century of world revolution which had loosened the very bonds of the social fabric. The need for the emotionalization of relationships if society was not to fall apart and disintegrate into its discrete ele- ments had been dramatized by Burke and de Bonald and de Maistre. Saint-Simon by his own testimony was communicating the same urgent longing of men for a society in which they could feel them- selves integral parts, an organic society, as contrasted with a state in which isolated units competed and fought with one another. Egalitarianism had come to represent the eternal struggle of equals in a world of cold and brutal competition. Talleyrand's image of the national workshop survives in Saint- Simon's writings, where the goal of the new society is maximum production through maximum utilization of individual capacities. In Saint-Simon's vision of the future golden age of plenty, the em- phasis is placed upon ever more production and creation, rather than upon consumption and distribution. The banquet spread before mankind is so sumptuous that dwelling upon material rewards, so characteristic of a world of scarcity, seems to be beside the point. Saint-Simon's humanitarian doctrine thus incorporated the Condorcet principle that society could be so organized that misery and ignorance became accidents rather than the norm of human experience; 28 his theory had none of the crushing pessimism associated with later Social Darwinism, even though he too was inspired by biological analogies. Perhaps the difference between the Saint-Simonian and the eighteenth-century conception has its crux in a new view of humanity. Instead of the man of reason as the most perfect expression of humanity towards which all men are striving, Saint-Simon thinks of man now and in the future as at once rational, activist, and religious, at once mind, will, and feeling. His ends are moral, intellectual, and physical, three major areas of human effort corresponding to the aptitudes of the artist, the scientist, and the industrialist. This is the whole man, whose being is paralleled in the organization of the healthy body social. If man is primarily a rational animal and the highest form of reason is mathematics, the Turgot-Condorcet egalitarian ideal of rational units behaving in accordance with mathematicized social rules is comprehensible. But if humanity is a composite whose various manifestations include the predominantly activist or religious as well as rationalist, the social structure, re- flecting and embracing the variety and diversity of men, will be organismic, a harmony of complex, different, and essential parts.
