This book is a worthwhile addition to the extensive bib- liography on Minoan cult. It presents a study of cult rooms and cult practices associated with settlement sites in Minoan Crete based predominantly on finds of archaeological mate- rial in context. Examination of non-settlement cult areas, such as peak and cave sanctuaries, is not included. Although these are areas where important new evidence is coming to light, and were part of the wider system of palace cult, the decision to exclude them is probably a wise one, as the mate- rial would quickly become out of date and would raise the problem of treating material as yet unpublished. There are essentially two parts to the book: the text and an extensive catalogue. This format no doubt reflects its ori- gin as a doctoral dissertation. A short introductory chapter summarizes what is "known" about Minoan cult, presenting a consensus of scholarship to date and contributing no major new insights. The following four chapters deal with the evi- dence for cult rooms and complexes and their contents in each of the four periods (Prepalatial, Protopalatial, Neopa- latial, and Postpalatial), defining four major architectural types: the bench sanctuary (attested throughout) and the pil- lar crypt, lustral basin, and tripartite shrine (almost exclu- sively Neopalatial). Within each chapter the analysis fol- lows a fixed order, moving from a general discussion via ar- chitectural features and cult objects to anthropomorphic fig- ures (and their symbols), votive figures, and cult equipment. Prepalatial cult receives only two pages, almost exclusively on Myrtos Fournou Korifi, while the fullest discussion (a reflection of the quantity of data available) is contained in the chapters dealing with the Neopalatial and Postpalatial periods. This imbalance serves to demonstrate how little we really know about the early development of the Minoan pa- latial system. Chapter 6 summarizes the continuities in ar- chitectural form and in cult objects observed in post-Minoan periods, and the final chapter surveys the evidence presented throughout for cult locations, figures and figurines, symbols, equipment, divinities and rites, and continuity of cult. Probably the most important and valuable section of the book is Appendix I, comprising a catalogue of 138 cult rooms or complexes organized alphabetically by site. Within each site, rooms are grouped by area. Under each entry is a reference to the plans and plates illustrating the room and the material found within, together with relevant bibliogra- phy, a brief architectural description, a list of finds, and a chronological attribution. The 95 plans, interspersed among the catalogue entries, illustrate almost all the rooms covered. The plans are reproduced (occasionally adapted) from origi-</page><page sequence="2">138 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 92 nal publications, resulting in no consistent graphic style or scale. In many, a compass indication is lacking, and in some cases, the scale of reproduction renders details invisible. Nevertheless, the plans provide an invaluable assistance in following both catalogue and text. The 180 plates, themati- cally grouped at the end of the volume, are of generally good quality. A second appendix contains eight presence-absence charts, three of which summarize the associations of differ- ent sanctuary types and material types by period, while the remaining five present the types of objects associated with bench sanctuaries, pillar crypts, and lustral basins. I would have preferred that the author refer to these charts more fre- quently, as they succinctly abstract information that takes up much description in the text. The dissertation on which this volume is based was origi- nally submitted in 1972. Expansion and updating were un- dertaken twice before the press date of 1983 (p. xx). As a result, most recent evidence has been taken into account, or is at least mentioned. While the volume Sanctuaries and Cults in the Aegean Bronze Age (Stockholm 1981) is re- ferred to (p. xix), it is surprising that the author has not made more use of it, particularly Hiller's long article sum- marizing the Linear B evidence for sanctuaries, relevant to Postpalatial Crete. Discussions of Minoan cult can lose sight of the raw ar- chaeological data for places where cult activity is likely to have taken place. This book presents that raw data for do- mestic cult, going back as far as is possible to original con- texts, and requiring (p. 2) that "distinctive architecture and cult objects both are necessary" to identify a cult area. At times, however, the identification of a cult area is made more on the basis of previous interpretations than on secure ar- chaeological criteria, for example, in the case of the so-called lustral basin. The author accepts the view that these are cult areas without offering proof securely based on archaeologi- cal evidence. Thus, to judge from the chart (p. 149) which summarizes finds from lustral basins, only that at Zakro (Room XXIV) appears to have a range of cult objects. Yet a glance at the catalogue (p. 137) shows that all these objects had in fact fallen from an upper story. Fortunately, the ex- tensive catalogue and detailed description contained in the text allow the reader to make up his or her own mind about a particular identification. These features ensure that this book will be valuable as a starting-point for studies of Mi- noan settlement sanctuaries, and I hope the data presented will be reviewed in the light of Renfrew's recent discussion of approaches to the identification of cult areas (The Ar- chaeology of Cult: The Sanctuary at Phylakopi [BSA Suppl. 18, 1985] 11-26).
