Two aspects of his work are examined in this article. Firstly, Jakobson purifies his linguistic theory of pragmatic references. Secondly, he develops his own diplomatic mission of mediating between East and West. In this article, I argue that these two aspects did not develop independently from one another. Instead I claim that his theory is designed to slip through the Iron Curtain, while at the same time providing the means to analyse ways of acting politically by using language. This argument is unfolded in two steps, each consisting of two parts. First, I compare the theory of pronominal expressions as developed by Emil Ben veniste to Jakobson' s theory of shifters. While Ben veniste focuses on the relation of language and its subject using language, Jakobson introduces a model of communication to allow maximal formalisation of lan- guage. According to this even the category of person can be freed from its reference to a subject which would be understood as having a place in space and time. Then, Jakobson's theory of shifters is studied in relation to his analyses of poetry. For this, two examples are chosen: Jakobson's text on two poems by Russian poet Alexandr Blok, and his text on a poem by Bertold Brecht. In both texts, the theory of shifters - and the alleged purification from pragmatic aspects of language use ensuing from this theory - is challenged by the simple fact that they focus on the pronoun of the first person plural. According to Jakobson, the category of number does not belong to the shifters. Rather, number quantifies participants of the related event. The pronoun 'we' is at the same time a shifter and a non-shifter, as it refers to the speech event and the related event. Thus the J.

Kursell pronoun 4we' opens up the possibility to include or exclude the participants of a communicative situation, and thereby enables the speaker to act socially or even politically by using language. The article concludes by coming back to the his- torical situation in which Jakobson developed his analyses of poetry. Analysing poetry seems to have been a passe-partout for him, a seemingly harmless subject that allowed him to get a foot in the door of remote and secluded lecture halls. Keywords Roman Jakobson • Post-WWII linguistics • Shifters • Pronouns • Bertold Brecht • Alexandr Blok • Formalism • Structuralism • Analysis of poetry Roman Jakobson is one of the main figures in post war linguistics and structuralism. Two aspects of his work will be examined here: firstly, the way Jakobson purified his linguistic theory of pragmatic references; secondly, how he developed his own diplomatic mission mediating between East and West. These two aspects did not develop independently of one another. The historical situation of the cold war helped shape and define some of Jakobson's theoretical concepts. The following investigation of his theory of shifters on the one hand, and the theory's application in his analyses of poetry on the other, intends to explore how this reflection of the historical setting can be approached. Initially, Jakobson's theory of shifters will be compared to Emile Benveniste's theory of personal pronouns and Michel Foucault's theory of the subject position. In contrast to these two an important feature of Jakobson's elucidations becomes apparent. He attempts to purify language of its pragmatic and empirical context. This does not mean that this theory precludes its own application to an analysis of such contexts. Rather it points to his quest for valid results that are independent from them. And therein a specific strategy is concealed, which was intended to help this theory slip through the Iron Curtain. Later, a reconstruction of Jakobson's analyses of poetry will demonstrate this. Here, Jakobson explores two basic conditions of utterances he encounters in his investigations of language: the use of language under the conditions of dictatorship, where an utterance can be lethal; and the use of language under the conditions of fiction, where reference is by definition ambiguous. While the first condition is defined by political circumstances in a specific historical condition, the second is further defined by the rules of literary genres. In the light of these considerations, Jakobson's studies of shifters in poetry can be seen as investigating the usurping of interpretative competency. This implies however, that Jakobson was not in a position to name the target of his critique. Again, the juxtaposition of his analysis of poetry with post-structuralist theories of the subject position will further elucidate this point in the following investigation. After a break of over 35 years, Roman Jakobson returned to Russia in 1956. The USSR Academy of Sciences had invited him as US representative of the International Committee of Slavists (ICS) for an eight-day visit to Moscow where the fourth International Congress of Slavists was to be prepared. Between then and 1967 he was to visit four more times. He went to the Soviet Union once more in Ô Springer</page><page sequence="3">First person plural 219 1979, travelling to Moscow and Tbilisi. Each time, he met up with old friends and associates and established new contacts.1 By the time of his first return visit to the Soviet Union, Jakobson had already become a US citizen and had taken up a professorship at Harvard for Slavic languages and literature along with general linguistics. He was also teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where in 1957 he was granted the status of institute professor. One of the projects he was working on then was a description and analysis of standard Russian, financed with a five-figure sum by the Rockefeller-Foundation. As a result of this work he wrote an essay on the morphology of Russian verbs, "Shifters, Verbal Categories, and the Russian Verb,"2 quoting, amongst other texts, Emile Benveniste's essay La nature des pronoms? which had been included in the collection of essays published to commemorate Jakobson's sixtieth birthday. In it Benveniste investigates the relationship between language and the speaking subject in a new way. He examines the category of person and concludes that it must be placed in a specific relationship to the act of speaking. Expressions such as T, 'now' and 'here', 'you', 'there' and 'yesterday' cannot be defined solely through their relationship to a speaking person; they must be viewed as simultaneous to the utterance in which a person-indicator appears. The theory of the 'shifter' with which Jakobson prefaces his elucidations of the Russian verbs, goes one step further; the key to elucidation is provided by the communication model, which Jakobson developed out of information theory. According to this, the way a shifter functions is explained in relationship to the message: "the general meaning of a shifter cannot be defined without a reference to the message."4 The message guarantees that the temporal, spatial and personal meaning of words such as T, 'now' and 'here' can be understood; the same applies to those verbal categories which Jakobson defines as 'shifters'. Jakobson's essay was also seen as representing his contribution to the issue of deixis.5 He does not, however, explain the way shifters function in terms of their reference to a deictic centre. In this text reference is defined literally as pointing, with the equation "referred to = pointed at".6 If reference is synonymous with pointing to something, then pointing is no longer peculiar solely to deictic expressions. One of Jakobson's later observations - "the concept of the shifter has seemed to me for some time to be one of the cornerstones of linguistics"7 - can thus be seen less as a demand for greater acknowledgement of the pragmatic than as emphasising that shifters are a linguistic term - which is to say, first and foremost, that shifters can be defined without reference to extra-linguistic circumstances. 1 For biographical information see Rudy 1 999a, b. Jakobson 1971a includes an editorial note mentioning the context in which it came to be written: "Prepared in Cambridge, Mass., 1956, for the Project 'Description and Analyses of Contemporary Standard Russian'" (p. 146). 3 Benveniste 1956. 4 Jakobson 1971a, p. 131. 5 See, for instance, Waugh 1976, particularly p. 24. 6 Jakobson 1971a, p. 130. 7 Jakobson and Pomorska 1983, p. 76. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="4">220 J. Kursell According to this, even a shifter itself does not require a person who is in a particular place at a particular time at the moment they say something and who guarantees that words such as T, 'now' and 'here', appearing in their utterance, can be understood. This is how language becomes mobile, as Jakobson later established in the case of childhood language learning. As soon as the child can master the simplest of sentence structures, they are free to talk about whatever they want. "This innovation frees the child, liberating him from the hie et nunc, the immediate temporal and spatial circumstances. From this moment on, he can speak of events that take place at a distance from him in time and space. Along with shifts of temporal and spatial points of reference, he acquires the idea of the shifting roles of the participants in the speech events."8 Unlike Benveniste, Jakobson does not ask the question as to how human beings acquire language, instead asking how, via language, we can distance ourselves from the circumstances of our person, location and time. The first of this paper's theses is that the essay "Shifters, Verbal Categories, and the Russian Verb" forms the basis for an investigation into linguistic mobility through 'shifts'; in it Jakobson demonstrates an authority over the theorems, examples and methods - and thus the language - of a country which he was now only ever to inhabit as a guest. As long as shifters are not analysed as acts, this authority over the language can be maintained. However, Jakobson's own analyses of poetic texts render the shifter theory uncertain. This is overtly clear in the case of the word 'we'. While the category of person counts as a shifter, this does not apply to the category of number. Saying 'we' is equivalent to an encroachment by the shifter into other forms of reference. If the sign T is defined as a reference to the addresser, the plural form of the first person pronoun must logically imply a multiplication of the addressing entity. This multiplication only makes sense as an act of speech - in choric speech. However, in two poems by Aleksandr Blok which Jakobson analyses, choric speech, and with it the word 'we', is deliberately avoided. If on the other hand a single speaker says 'we', he or she does not refer solely to him- or herself but also to other people. The shifter's encroachment on the reported now takes the form of the inclusion or exclusion of particular individuals, irrespective of whether they are present or not. Jakobson investigates the dimension of acts committed using language and structured by the inclusion and exclusion of individuals with the aid of poetic texts. In the process he introduces the term "grammatical-fiction". His analysis of shifters is one of the most important elements of his analyses of grammatical fictions. It is not however essential within fiction to distinguish between intra-linguistic and extra-linguistic context. Thus the pragmatic dimension of grammatical categories such as shifters, and with it the dimension of acts committed using language, is subjected to a purely philological investigation. Via an analysis of grammatical fictions it should be possible to distinguish synonymous expressions, which purportedly refer to the same thing and can be seen, except in poetry, as redundant. 8 Jakobson and Pomorska 1983, p. 77. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="5">First person plural 221 With the introduction of the grammatical fictions the intensity of the action is blunted by language. A good example of this is Jakobson' s analysis of Brecht' s poem Wir sind sie (We are the Party, literally We are it/they). The context this analysis is placed in is a theory of the shifting of words' meaning, Jakobson' s own theory of shifters to be precise, but the historical circumstances with which this particular text might be associated are not presented; the play which the poem was originally part of, Die Maßnahme (Brecht 1998, The Decision, also translated as The Measures Taken, Brecht 1977), is about a show trial. This reticence towards the context is the pretext for second thesis which will be pursued below: Jakobson' s analyses introduce an approach to reading poems which does not read between the lines, at same time delineating the boundaries of this approach. These boundaries are demarcated in his dictum "Linguista sum, linguistici nihil a me alienum puto" which also conversely implies remaining silent on everything which does not fall within the specialist field of the linguist, including one's own aims. The issue of the relevance of inclusion and exclusion to Jakobson, a Slavist and linguist who did not live in Russia, is therefore to be investigated via his own texts. The background to this is a discussion of the notion of the shifter, investigating the relationship between message and person, undertaken largely within French discourse analysis theory, because what is being undertaken here includes the reconstruction of a subject position via Jakobson's academic work. This reconstruction thus does not seek support from the Soviet academic history context,9 which is rooted in a very particular dynamic of inclusion and exclusion; it behaves anti-symmetrically towards the fictions of grammar, above all towards the mobility of the analytic apparatus, which characterises Jakobson's work, in as far as the pragmatic dimension, and not only the dimension of the act committed using language, pushes its way to the foreground here. If the theory of the shifter holds any potential for the analysis of linguistic acts then it would appear helpful for the delineation of the boundaries and methods to maintain the heuristic separation of language and act for as long as possible. Person In 1956 a collection of essays marking Jakobson's sixtieth birthday was published, including La nature des pronoms by Émile Benveniste. Using the example of the personal pronouns Benveniste addresses the problem of "intersubjective commu- nication"10 which consists of the fact that a speaker has no personal sign at his or her disposal, intended only for him- or herself, with which he or she can express the "feeling he has of his irreducible subjectivity".1 ' The pronouns are formed in such a 9 In this sense Jakobson was both present in and absent from the Soviet Union. He enjoyed a broad, intense and even sustained reception according to Gamkrelidze/Elizarenkova/Ivanov (1976); however no edition of Jakobson's writings was published in the Soviet Union. Igor' Mel'cuk failed in his attempt to publish a collection of Jakobson's writings in Russian translation at the end of the 1960s. "RJ returned to Russia" (Mel'cuk 1976) only when, in 1985, a selection of his work was finally published in Russian. 10 Benveniste (1971) p. 219. 1 ' Benveniste, op. cit., p. 220. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">222 J. Kursell way that they are able to resolve this problem; they are "empty" signs, not referential in relation to reality, always available, becoming "full" as soon as a speaker adopts them in his speech.12 The pronouns are divided into two kinds, according to the linguistic mode whose signs they are. The first kind belong to the syntax of the respective language; the second to the "instances de discours"™ in other words "the discrete and always unique acts by which the language is actualized by a speaker".14 This distinction runs throughout the personal pronouns too; only the first and second person pronouns can correctly be described as personal pronouns. The so-called third person does not really belong to the personal pronouns, because it does not include the notion of the person. The category of the personal pronoun in its genuine sense can be illuminated by analysing the pronoun T. To this end La nature des pronoms exposes the notions of the entity or moment {instance), of the utterance (énoncé/énontiation) and of practice (exercice). With the notion of the instance de discours a possibility is opened up for distinguishing discrete units found only in the practice of speaking and not necessarily coterminous with words, lexemes or signs. "/ can only be identified by the instance of discourse that contains it."15 If the personal pronoun T appears in an instance of discourse, it then determines the way all deictic expressions function, in that T transfers its "indicator of person" onto them. Expressions such as 'this', 'now' and 'here' are however not only deictic because they refer to this indicator of person; they must be understood as coextensive and contemporaneous to the instance of discourse, which includes T. It is only when the language is practiced that the necessary time indicator here is created. Until the deictic expressions appear in the instances of discourse, they remain without referents and thus incomplete signs. They come into existence as soon as they are actualized by speech. Thus a characteristic of the pronoun T is that it does not constitute a class of reference, as there is no object definable as T to which all instances of the use of T refer in an identical manner.16 The essential characteristic of the pronoun T is that it refers to its use, but not however to an external object: "it is a fact both original and fundamental that these 'pronominal' forms do not refer to 'reality' or to 'objective' positions in space or time but to the utterance (énonciation), unique each time, that contains them, and thus they reflect their proper use."17 The problem of inter-subjective communication is thus reformulated as a problem of referential relationships. While other nouns either allow themselves to be actualized via a concrete object or not at all, the pronouns, which contain the notion of the person, constantly refer to an unrepeatable object. The only possible referential relationship the personal pronoun T is in a position to create is a circular 12 Benveniste, op. cit., p. 219. 13 Benveniste (1956) p. 34. 14 Benveniste (1971) p. 217. " Benveniste 1971, p. 218. 16 See Benveniste 1971, p. 218. 17 Benveniste 1971, p. 219. £) Springer</page><page sequence="7">First person plural 223 one - because T only refers to something when it is used, and what it then refers to is this use itself. In the practice of language as speech, the speaker's self- reference and the self- referentiality of the message are intermingled. "Each / has its own reference and corresponds each time to a unique being who is set up as such."18 The empty sign guarantees every speaker the reference to his sense of his own "subjectivité irréductible". The process of appropriating language using T sets out marks using individual moments; and the systematic character of language means that the appropriation, once signalled, transfers itself over the entire structure formally, or more specifically over the receptive elements. The speaking individual can position him- or herself as a subject by identifying him- or herself as the unique person who is saying T. Thus the speaking subject is, in turn, defined by the instances of discourse or speech moments, in other words via that particular linguistic construction which it uses when it itself declares itself a speaker. This closes the circular argument. Benveniste's "De la subjectivité dans le langage,"19 an essay which appeared two years later, explores the circular argument from the opposite direction. The relationship between language and subject is now reversed. Language is now defined as the "foundation of subjectivity".20 Here too the talk is of how in the instance of discourse, which contains T, the speaker is predicated as subject. Yet from this Benveniste reaches another conclusion: "If one really thinks about it, one will see that there is no other objective testimony to the identity of the subject except that which he himself thus gives about himself."21 The first port of call during this "bringing out of subjectivity in language"22 is the personal pronouns. This time the argumentation is closed in that the possibility of an appropriation by language is ultimately revoked: "The establishment of 'subjectivity' in language creates the category of person - both in language and also, we believe, outside of it as well." (Benveniste 1971, 227) Shifters In Roman Jakobson' s essay Shifters, Verbal Categories, and the Russian Verb, first published in 1957, the concept of 'person' is solely of a grammatical category. The speaker does not appear as subject, and the issue of the shifter is not tackled via the personal pronoun of the first person singular. The argumentation instead distinguishes itself from the traditional concepts of the personal pronouns and deictic expressions because its point of departure is a communication-theory model: "The peculiarity of the personal pronoun and other shifters was often believed to consist in the lack of a single, constant, general meaning. Every shifter, however, 18 Benveniste 1971, p. 218. 19 First published in Journal de Psychologie, juillet-septembre 1958. 20 Benveniste 1971, p. 224. 21 Benveniste 1971, p. 226. 22 Benveniste 1971, p. 226. â Springer</page><page sequence="8">224 J. Kursell possesses its own general meaning. Thus / means the addresser (and you, the addressee) of the message to which it belongs."23 Without the premised model of communication this definition would not be possible. Thus the essay begins with a reformulation of this model. "A message sent by its addresser must be adequately perceived by its receiver. Any message is encoded by its sender and is to be decoded by its addressee. The more closely the addressee approximates the code used by the addresser, the higher is the amount of information obtained."24 The increase in the "amount of information" mentioned here implies the separation of code and message. While in communication theory this separation is determined by a definition, in spoken communication there are occasions when the definition does not apply, or only to an extent: "Both the message (M) and the underlying code (C) are vehicles of linguistic communication, but both of them function in a duplex manner; they may at once be utilized and referred to (= pointed at)."25 When message and code simultaneously act as both means of communication and object of the communication, a message may refer to the code or to another message, and the meaning of an element of the code can include a reference to the code or the message. Thus among elements of the model there are four types of "duplex" reference - or self-reference; in reported speech a message includes another message (M/M); proper names refer, as elements of the code, to the code (C/ C); a message referring to the code is described as "autonymous" (M/C); finally shifters are elements of the code which can only be defined in reference to the message (C/M). An entirely different problem is being formulated from that of the change of individual using the language; the shifters represent one of four special cases of the application of the communication model to linguistic communication. In all four cases the separation of code and message is at stake and thus the code's assimilation of the addresser and addressee is also up for discussion. It has often been pointed out that Jakobson made in depth studies of communication theory and received important stimuli from it.26 And Jakobson himself emphasised this too. When in 1949 he took up the offer of a professorship at Harvard for Slavic languages and literature and general linguistics, he became acquainted with the book The Mathematical Theory of Communication by Claude Shannon und Warren Weaver and corresponded with both authors on the similarities between communication theory and traditional linguistics. Jakobson's closing lecture at the 1952 Conference of Anthropologists and Linguists included his "avowal" of communication-theory terminology: "I must confess that the Code- Message concepts of communication theory are much clearer, much less ambig- uous, and much more operational than the traditional presentation of this dichotomy 23 Jakobson 1971a, p. 132. 24 Jakobson 1971a, p. 130. 25 Jakobson 1971a, p. 130. 2ft Cf. Kay 2000, pp. 297-310, and Gerovitch 2002, pp. 91-94. â Springer</page><page sequence="9">First person plural 225 in the theory of language. I believe that it's preferable to work at present with these well-defined, measurable and analysable concepts."27 The reason why these concepts in particular are preferable, and what happens when they are introduced into linguistics, remains unclear.28 The communication- theory terms established themselves however and in some cases supplanted the traditional terminology.29 Communication theory's initial model did not remain untouched. Thus, for instance, Jakobson' s notion of the addresser differs from Shannon's in that two elements of Shannon's description of communication are consolidated within it. While in his diagram of a communication chain Shannon allocates the selection and encoding of messages to two adjacent chain links, Jakobson's notion of the 'addresser' does not distinguish between these two elements. Similarly, his notion of the message is a synthesis of Shannon's notions of 'message' and 'signal'. These in turn are based on the distinction between the message source, which selects a message, and the addresser, who translates it into the signal to be transmitted.30 In verbal communication however the process of encoding is separable neither from the content of a message, nor can an utterance be made via a succession of selection and encoding. From the perspective of cybernetics Jakobson's formulation was understood as anthropomorphism, given that it premised human use of language as its application.31 In linguistics on the other hand the gesture of formalisation using communication theory terminology defined the perception of the model. However much Jakobson's model of communication might differ from commu- nication theory, it remains suited to the task of lending the shifters that "objective" significance they were denied by, for instance, Benveniste. The model makes it possible to consider the act of speech beyond examples of its practice. Who or what might fill the position of speaker no longer has to be determined, because the addresser is simply a variable in the formalised representation of communication. Referring to the addresser as the objective meaning of the shifter T does not however involve any temporal concrétisation. This is not only because in the case of human communication no statement can be made on the succession of selection and encoding of the message. For the shifter theory such a succession is less crucial than a temporal reference point. The temporal reference point, however, is now contained within the message. The notion of the message presumes the practice of communication; the temporal index is not burdened with the self-perception of the subject. The definition of a shifter as an element of the code which refers to the message does not require such a subject. Although the guarantee of classifying time and 27 Jakobson 1971b, pp. 558f. 28 SeeFehr 1999, p. 1. 29 In the case of Roman Jakobson, Gerovitch lists the following replacements: "Instead of Ferdinand de Saussure' s opposition langue and parole, Jakobson began using code and message; he substituted subcodes for styles, and replaced contextual variations with redundant features; encoding and decoding supplanted production and comprehension; and speaker and listener became encoder and decoder." (Gerovitch 2002, p. 92). 30 Cf. Shannon and Weaver 1949, p. 44. 31 See Gerovitch 2002. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="10">226 J. Kurseil place via the speaking subject is thus eschewed, Jakobson's shifter theory does include a temporal index; as part of the classification of verbal categories the message is defined as an event. Via their possible combinations, two general distinctions form the basis of this classification, one between language and that which it narrates, and one between an event and its participants: "four items are to be distinguished: a narrated event (En), a speech event (Es), a participant of the narrated event (Pn), and a participant of the speech event (Ps), whether addresser or addressee."32 A temporal index can therefore be introduced via the message but the addresser and addressee also reconfigure themselves via the message understood as an event. Depending on whether the verbal category contains a reference to the event of speaking and its participants or not, we are dealing either with shifters or non-shifters: "Both designators and connectors may characterize the narrated event (procès de l'énoncé) and/or its participants either without or with reference to the speech event (procès de renonciation) (../Es) or its participants (../Ps). Categories implying such a reference are to be termed shifters; those without such a reference are non-shifters."33 Plural According to Jakobson a message which includes 'we' conveys two independent pieces of information using this word: information on the category of the person, and information on the category of the number. The first person refers to the addresser, in other words to an instance which does not represent a multiplicity; the plural refers to more than one participant of the event described. Who this pronoun includes - whether it refers to the speaker and the listener, to the speaker as participant along with further participants of the event described, whether it includes others present but excludes the addressee, or the other way around, or whether it refers to a group of individuals all speaking simultaneously - is unclear when 'we' is ascribed to these two categories. The distinction between an exclusive and an inclusive use of the personal pronouns of the first person plural can redress the situation up to a certain point. The communication model makes this distinction more difficult however. Just as "we is not 'the plural of/"',34 'we' does not create a plurality of addressing entities either. In the model the entity of the addresser is kept free from a possible multiplication. The separation of the pieces of information on number and person contained in the word 'we' thus helps here. Even when the addresser alone cannot stand in as compensation for the absent guarantee of the here and now, in this way certain consequences of the reformulated definition of the shifter according to communication theory are suppressed as the separation of number and person in the pronoun 'we' allows it to be a shifter and a non-shifter at the same time. 32 Jakobson 1971a, p. 133. 33 Jakobson 1971a, p. 134. 34 Lyons 1968, p. 277. 4y Springer</page><page sequence="11">First person plural 227 The verbal category 'person' belongs to the shifters. A dissociation of the third person from the other two is not necessary here. When the person category is divided into the marked first and second persons and unmarked third person,35 the whole category can be assigned to the shifters; the third person then signifies that no statement is being made about the categorising mark. This means it signifies neither that the predicated person does not take part in the speech event, nor that they are exclusively to be seen as participants in the narrated event. Number, on the other hand, is not included amongst the shifters: "Among categories involving the participants of the narrated event, gender and number characterize the participants themselves without reference to the speech event - gender qualifies, and number quantifies the participants."36 This classification of number is related to the use of the communication model. The instance of the addresser does not multiply itself, no matter who is speaking. Thus any linguistic quantification of participants of the event of speaking becomes part of what is narrated. A quantification of the addresser is as superfluous as it is impossible. Or, conversely, the plural forms of the verbs or the pronouns in the message are marked in as far as they refer to a fact which is not self-evident. Within the grammatical personal forms - in other words the verb forms of the first and second persons - in Russian, there is a distinction between the first person, marked as such, and the second person, which does not necessarily announce the relationship between the predicated action and the participants of the speech. In one of Jakobson's earlier essays on Russian verbs he writes of this generalised personal form: "The context determines which person this form refers to in each case - whether to any person (untres', pochorónjat [when you die, someone will bury you]), to the person speaking (vyp'es", byvalo [sometimes you drank yourself into a stupor]) or to the person actually being addressed."37 A formalisation of the entities involved in communication is not yet available here; instead context and example are brought into define and explain the situation. Thus here, in 1932, the semantics of the verbs chosen in the examples determines whether the speaker is referring to himself when using the second person, is therefore able to accuse himself of drinking in Russian in the second person singular, or whether he means all potential addressees, or one who is actually present. Via the use of the communication model the representation of this situation shifts. The significance of self-reference on the part of the addresser when using the second person needs to be defined more precisely, because formally it appears as a reference to the addressee. It is now necessary to distinguish between an inclusive form within the second person ("signalling the participation of the addresser") and an exclusive form without any such indication. The fact that in Russian such inclusion and exclusion situations must be differentiated in the second person singular obscures a problem, because in this case the singularity of the addresser remains unquestioned. In a description of the 35 On the marked/unmarked distinction, cf. Jakobson 1971c, p. 3. For criticism of the distinction cf.

Kursell addressee, the addresser can include any other addressees they wish, even themselves, without the affiliation of the respective forms to the shifters being called into doubt in the process. Thus the possibility of signalising the speaker's appropriation of language did not only remain an "open debate,"38 language also became detachable from questions of its use by individuals. That which appears in Benveniste as the self-referentiality of the personal pronouns in the instances of discourse splits the concept of the shifter into a duplex referential i ty on two levels: speech refers to the communication model; in order to define the shifters the communication model needs the reference to the event of speaking. The self-reference of speaking individuals remains excluded from the representation. As soon as an examination of the shifters is detached from the relationship to concrete individuals it becomes feasible to consider the classification of the place, from which an utterance is possible. Classifying the subject position according to the premise "What does it matter who is speaking?" is part of the definition of the utterance or "enunciation" which Michel Foucault undertakes in The Archaeology of Knowledge. "There can be no signs without someone, or at least something, to emit them."39 The existence of signs demands an author or a producing entity. "But this 'author' is not identical with the subject of the statement; and the relation of production that he has with the formulation is not superposable to the relation that unites the enunciating subject and what he states." Thus a distinction is made "between the transmitter of signs and the subject of a statement".40 When, in the Archaeology of Knowledge, the way the shifters' function is explained through a reference to "the speaking subject" this presumes a changed notion of the subject. Subject and author of a formulation are distinguished when the subject is a place or a position. Neither in its substance, nor in its function is it identical with this author. "It is a particular, vacant place that may in fact be filled by different individuals."41 The subject as position is the precondition for defining the utterance. What makes sentences or propositions into utterances is that the position of the subject in them can be determined and not that "1 day, someone happened to speak them or put them into some concrete form of writing."42 Shifters, for their part, do not necessarily describe the individual connected to the name of an author,43 because the "author function" places such a referential relationship in question. In discourses equipped with an author function, the shifters do not work in the same way as in those where this function is lacking. "In the latter, these 'shifters' refer to a real 38 Benveniste 1971, p. 217. 39 Foucault 1972, p. 92. 40 Foucault 1972, p. 92. 41 Foucault 1972, p. 95. 42 Foucault 1972, p. 95. 43 Cf. Foucault 1984: "f...] a text always bears a number of signs that refer to the author. Well known to the grammarians, these textual signs are personal pronouns, adverbs of time and place, and the conjugation of verbs." Ö Springer</page><page sequence="13">First person plural 229 speaker and to an actual deictic situation."44 Only in this case does the "speaking subject" coincide with the "author". Through the author function on the other hand, the shifters' way of functioning becomes more complex and variable. By making the model of the position accessible in a new way, communication theory enabled the distinction between subject and author as well as that between a subject position and an addresser. In communication theory, the position of the subject, which can be filled by various individuals, is placed between the entity of the addresser and the grammatical, syntactical position of the subject. In this way Foucault introduces a new differentiation which, in contrast to communication theory and linguistic theory is based on the instances of discourse, which are seen as uttered.45 In contrast to the concept of instances of discourse as developed by Benveniste, this concept of instances of discourse is distinctive in that it also encompasses fictions. In Benveniste' s argumentation fiction is not named as a separate example. It is subsumed in the unmarked third person, the non-personne and thus poses no problems of its own as regards the constitution of person. Thus the problem addressed by Foucault in "The thought from Outside" is avoided. The T in Benveniste's example sentences says "I swear" or "je jure" but not "I speak" or "je parle".46 According to Foucault however the sentence "I speak" puts the whole of modern fiction to the test. And this sentence can be understood as an "absolute opening through which language endlessly spreads forth, while the subject - the T who speaks - fragments, disperses, scatters, disappearing in that naked space."47 Fictions While in the two texts cited Benveniste does not address fiction, Jakobson proposes various theses on fiction. His examples are taken from a broad body of poems using which he investigates the function of shifters and other grammatical categories. While a genre theory such as that of Käte Hamburger sees a possibility in T to commit poetry to the here and now and thus to classify it as a non-fictional genre, Jakobson's investigations of poetry take a different approach. Poetry of Grammar and Grammar of Poetry lays the methodological fundament of his investigations and to this end distinguishes initially between the use of grammatical meaning within and outside of poetic writing. Outside of poetry the diversity of grammatical meanings often fails to correspond to the diversity of the real occurrences: "One and the same state of affairs is presented by the sentences: A lie (or lying or to lie) is a sin (or is sinful), To lie is to sin, Liars sin (or are sinful or are sinners), or with a 44 Foucault 1984, p. 101. The similarity between The Archaeology of Knowledge and Benveniste's writings has been established by Agamben 2002, p. 137ff. 46 Foucault 1989, p. 9f. 47 Foucault 1989, p. 11. â Springer</page><page sequence="14">230 J. Kursell generalizing singular The liar sins or is sinful, is a sinner). Only the way of presentation differs."48 The multiplicity of the grammatical categories cannot however be understood to reflect "our intuitive analysis of reality as our ability to compose that reality into a variety of formal patterns".49 Instead there are "linguistic fictions" which grammatical structure is based on and which must be used throughout the whole field of language: "Linguistic fictions should neither be 'mistaken for realities' nor be ascribed to the creative fancy of linguists: they 'owe their existence' actually 'to language alone' and particularly to the 'grammatical form of the discourse'.".50 Although the examination of grammatical fictions does not include narrative texts, it does not deal with the differentiation of a speaking T in poetry either. Instead it observes the effects of the use of grammar. Jakobson' s analyses of grammar in poetry show which operations help grammatical meanings to be created. If the analyses of poems exemplify the shifter theory, then not in the way dismissed by Foucault in The Discourses on Language concerning the relationship between subject and language: "It seems to me that the theme of the founding subject permits us to elide the reality of discourse. The task of the founding subject is to animate the empty forms of language with his objectives; through the thickness and inertia of empty things, he grasps intuitively the meanings lying within them. Beyond time, he indicates the field of meanings - leaving history to make them explicit - in which the propositions, sciences, and deductive ensembles ultimately find their foundation."51 Anti-symmetry For his analyses of poetry Jakobson chose decidedly short poetic texts, suitable for a "slow and repeated reading".52 The object of such reading was not the change of the grammatical categories' "material content"53 but that which appears in the poem as the "geometry of language". The analysis of this geometry is the precondition for an examination of the grammatical fictions. What the text Poetry of Grammar and Grammar of Poetry evolves is less grammar's poetry than its geometry. One of the warrantors of this geometry was Josef Stalin. The characteristic feature of grammar, according to Stalin's 1950 polemical text on the Marr school linguists, is that it provides rules for changing words, but not for concrete words, not in connection with their use, only for words generally. Thus by abstracting from the particular and the concrete within words as well as in sentences, grammar grasps those general principles which the changes to words and the combination of words in sentences are based on and forms the grammatical rules from them. "In this respect grammar 48 Jakobson 1981c, p. 88. 49 Jakobson is quoting Edward Sapir, Language (New York, 1921), p. 89. See Jakobson 1981c, p. 88. 50 Jakobson 1981c. 1 Foucault 1972, pp. 227-228 ("The Discourse on Language"). 52 Jakobson and Pomorska 1983, 108. 53 Jakobson and Pomorska 1983, 77. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="15">First person plural 231 bears a resemblance to geometry, which, when giving its laws, abstracts itself from concrete objects, treats objects as bodies deprived of concreteness and defines their mutual relations not as concrete relations but as relations of bodies in general, namely, relations deprived of any concreteness."54 The poets chosen, such as Aleksandr Blok for instance, are candidates for further warrantors of the geometry of grammar, or, in Blok' s own words, "the mathematics of poetry". Jakobson' s analyses of the poems "fleByinica ne/ia b uepKOBHOM xope. . ." (A girl sang in the church choir. . .) and Fonocrnxopa (A voice from the choir), which he grouped together under the title CmuxomeopHbie npopimanun A Ejiokü (Verse prophecies by A. Blok) refer largely, despite parallel poetic approaches, to the semantic contrasts contained in the poems. This principle, for which Jakobson used the term 'anti-symmetry', borrowed from the Russian-Soviet crystal lographer Alexej Subnikov, can be seen first in the individual texts and then once more when they are compared; in anti-symmetry a pattern is reflected, but one of the characteristics of the original pattern is then replaced by something else. The analysis of the two Blok poems is not an attempt to interpret motives such as "voice" or "choir"; it assesses the "geometric" regularity of the verses, which are filled with contrasting semantics demonstrating the arbitrariness of such "filling" altogether: "How ever strongly one will insist in the borrowing of the motive, there is no doubt that A Voice from the choir follows the advice of the writers' Autobiography from 1909: There is a mathematics of the word (as there is a mathematics of all the other arts), especially in poetry.'"55 In contrast to the poems' titles, both texts decline to seize the opportunity for choric speaking. In one instance the "choir" is one of many precise locations mentioned within a church, but the group of people occupying the space remain silent; in the other instance the "voice" detaches itself from the choir at the start to form an overt lyrical first-person- perspective which then addresses the choir; the personal pronoun of the first person plural does not appear in either poem once. The difference between the choir and the subject of the speech confirms the addresser's singularity. This two-part analysis is still however about a 'shift', or in Russian 'sdvig': "On both levels - that of grammatical semantics and that of verse order - poetic identity and shift are evokingly combined [...]; the surprising similarity in the grammar of the lines goes with a no less remarkable difference. Such is poetry, this is the essence of Aleksandr Blok' s work, and this is, indeed, the nature of his prophecy about the days of the last century."56 We The problem of a multiplicity of speakers, which the question of choric speaking in the two analyses of Blok' s poetry seems to open up, becomes an issue in another of Jakobson's analyses, in the case of Brecht's "attempt to show human relationships 54 Quoted in Jakobson 1981c, d. 95. 55 Jakobson 1981a, p. 563.

Kursell as contradictory and violent struggle and fight."57 Here the shifters themselves are a site of shifting meaning. The dissociation between addresser or author and subject of the utterance or "statement" as formulated by Foucault in The Archaeology of Knowledge applies here in three senses: "in so far as the subject of the statement is a particular function, but is not necessarily the same from one statement to another; in so far as it is an empty function, that can be filled by virtually any individual when he formulates the statement; and in so far as one and the same individual may occupy in turn, in the same series of statements, different positions, and assume the role of different subjects."58 In Der grammatische Bau des Gedichts von B. Brecht 'Wir sind sie' a lecture given at the Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, the (East-) Berlin academy of sciences, Jakobson analysed Brecht' s poem "Wir sind sie" ("We are the party", literally 'we are them/her') in its various versions. A particular feature of the poem is that in one of its versions it was intended to be performed - as part of the Lehrstück Die Maßnahme (Brecht 1977, 1998; the poem appears for the first time in the second version of the play without being marked in any way as a separate text or song.59 "Wir sind sie" shows how an addressee, the murdered "young comrade," is excluded from the pronoun 'we' by various changing speakers in a process of semantic shifting. Both the possibility for choric speaking allowed by the play and the pronoun 'wir' ('we') as they appear both in the poem's text and the dramaturgical context, call Jakobson's shifter theory into question. The separation of person and number is not secured by the pronoun 'we'; inclusion and exclusion of those participating in speaking needs to be clarified for each individual instance of a pronoun via the surrounding text and with the assistance of an examination of the "grammatical geometry". This is introduced here in a juxtaposition of the poet Brecht with the complexity theorist Andrei N. Kolmogorov: "These are the words that Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) had pronounced to advocate the autonomous laws of his verse: 'Ego, poeta Germanus, supra grammaticos sto'. As A. N. Kolmogorov had rightly remarked the grammatical structure is poetry's neglected dimension."60 Where the grammar becomes fictional it reaches over its own boundaries and becomes the object of complexity theory. The play Die Maßnahme demonstrates the arbitrariness of the filling of speaker positions. The directions for performing the poem stipulate that the characters recite the poem one after another: "The poem consists of four stanzas, corresponding to the number of four 'agitators' in Brecht' s piece who report before the 'control choir's' tribunal about their conversation with the young comrade whom they killed: 'Three of them line up against the fourth, one of them representing the young comrade' The first stanza is the young comrade's speech, the other three are the 37 Quoted in Jakobson 1981b, p. 676. Cf. on this analysis by Jakobson most recently the commentary by Hendrik Birus in Jakobson 2007b. 58 Foucault 1972, pp. 93-94. 59 Cf. Brecht 1998, p. 67. 60 Jakobson 1981b, p. 660. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="17">First person plural 233 agitators' replies, which can, according to the author's remarks, be divided between the three actors."61 The function of the shifters can be taken literally here; as an exchangeability of individuals, who avail themselves of their respective shifters: "In the stage version of the dialogue the mutual relationship between the 'you' (du) and the 'we' (wir), between the young comrade and the four agitators is impressively underlined by the author's indications: 'Every actor shall, for once, have the occasion to show the behaviour of the young comrade; therefore each of the actors should play him in one of his main scenes. This switching (Umschaltung) makes the role of shifters, which is taken over by personal pronouns in language, an artful device."62 The subject of this analysis of Brecht's poem is thereby named explicitly: shifters as "device." It can already be seen in the gestural function of the pronouns in Brecht. The subject is further developed however in the personal pronouns of the first person plural, the real arena of the shifting - because not only does the word 'we' fail to secure the theoretical separation of number and person; what 'we' refers to can always be determined by the context if necessary, and thus by the formal peculiarity of the poem - in this case the poem Wir sind sie. The reason for this is "the semantic lability and inner contradiction that is inherent in the personal pronoun of first person plural".63 The potential for inclusion and exclusion is no longer only afforded to the second person here, in Brecht, but also for the first person plural. "The inclusive 'we', which includes the addressee, is replaced by the exclusive 'we', which is opposed to the second person.64 "Wir sind sie" from Brecht's Maßnahme clearly shows the situation where the entities of addresser and subject must be separated again. Michel Foucault notes: "One might also mention, by way of showing the dissociation between the transmitter of signs and the subject of a statement, the case of a text read by a third person, or that of an actor speaking his part."65 The example of Wir sind sie makes the entities of speech retreat still further from a "material content"66 and ultimately from an interpretability. Jakobson, at any rate, restricted himself to the analysis of the grammatical fictions. He abstains from analysing the configuration of protagonists in the play, which explores the possibilities for performing arbitrary constellations of individuals via the same four "agitators" and he also abstains from any reference to historical situations. The basic precondition for the grammatical fictions here is that special form of verbal communication defined within the shifter theory as the circular reference of the message - via the code - to the message. 61 Jakobson 1981b, p. 662. 62 Jakobson 1981b, p. 669. 63 Jakobson 1981b, p. 669. 64 Jakobson 1981b, p. 669. 65 Foucault 1972, p. 92. 66 Jakobson and Pomorska 1983, p. 77. 4y Springer</page><page sequence="18">234 J. Kursell Conclusion: person/s According to Benveniste the pronouns - as self-referential and empty signs - cannot be used incorrectly; as they do not state anything, they are not subject to the conditions of truth and escape denial. In the English short version of his fundamental methodological text Poetry of Grammar and Grammar of Poetry Jakobson quotes Philip Sidney's Defence of Poesie: "Now for the Poet, he nothing affirmeth, and therefore never lieth."67 In so doing he justifies the linguistic fictions, which are given freest reign in poetic writing. The poet does not even need to have been lying in the first place; to define the poetic function it is enough to narrow the circular reference of a message to a message down to the reference of a message to itself. T and 'we' are shifters in poetry too. A shifter however is no guarantee of a tie to a here and now; it is a site of shifting and deferral. The huge number of poetic analyses which succeeded Jakobson's intense interest in communication theory obscured a few retractions of previously advanced postulates. However it is precisely his analysis of 'we' in Brecht' s poem which shows what kind of statements Jakobson abstains from; it is as if they show the boundaries of his silence. While in the 1950s, when compared with alternative linguistic theories, this silence can be presented as an omission or displacement, in the light of some aspects of contemporary post-structuralist theory the poetry analyses can be seen to represent a deliberate act of academic politics. With his analyses in his suitcase, Jakobson the philological activist and travelling scholar engendered and exhibited the ubiquity of grammatical parallelisms and anti- symmetries.68 This activity followed a particular procedure. For the analysis of poetry written in languages other than Russian, experts were brought in. The chosen texts were short enough to be memorable; if necessary they could be learned by heart. They were light enough not to weigh the suitcase down. Reconstructing a subject position in the scientific discourse during the cold war, one is confronted with the fact that the rules seem to privilege the allegedly objective third person of science (Benveniste 1971). Jakobson's emphasis on formalisation, however, had the side effect that it was potentially able to advance what could be said on both sides of the Iron Curtain. Searching for the invariants of language on the one hand, and purifying language of its situation on the other, he saw himself as a diplomat (Ivanov 1999). In this context, "structural objectivity" (Daston and Galison 2007) obtains a vital new semantic shade: in the Stalinist Soviet Union, Jakobson had 'nevozvrasenec' or non-returner status and as such stood accused of high treason (Gerovitch 1999). This still applied in 1956 at the time of his first Moscow visit. In the McCarthy-era US on the other hand he was accused of conspiracy with the communist eastern bloc (Rudy 1999a, b). In his analyses of poetry, however, Jakobson created a surface under or, more precisely, upon which to conceal the obvious. To read the lines turned out to be more difficult, and thus safer, than to read between the lines. Jakobson himself, who helped lay the 67 Jakobson 1981c, p. 89. ft8 According to Vjaceslav Ivanov's memoirs Jakobson saw himself as an academic diplomat (Ivanov 1999, p. 220). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="19">First person plural 235 foundation of a methodology for the reconstruction of subject positions, spoke openly about this and thus allowed it to pass unnoticed. It has been contested whether a "personology" lies behind the shifters theory; in A Thousand Plateaus Gilles Deleuze und Félix Guattari describe how linguistics seems to show that personal pronouns in the third person show a lack of clarity as regards subjectivity, in this sense similar to the indefinite article or the indefinite pronouns. Their accusation was targeted above all at the work of Emile Benveniste and they proposed a contrary thesis: "We believe on the contrary that the third person indefinite, HE, THEY, IT, implies no indeterminacy from this point of view; it ties the statement to a collective assemblage, as its necessary condition, rather than to a subject of the enunciation."69 Deleuze and Guattari show that the clarity of such apparently indeterminate elements of speech are often created so that the indefinite element can be replaced by a definite element, a plural by a singular. What they offer instead of this is shared authorship. "We believe on the contrary" is not the pluralis modestiae of an academic author; it simply denotes the two names printed on the book's cover.
