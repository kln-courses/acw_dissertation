<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID JONES: LETTERS TO H. S. EDE Selected and Edited by John Matthias The following selections from David Jones's letters to H. S. Ede orig- inally appeared in the English journal PN Review (Volume 8, Number 2) . In the same issue of that publication, I reviewed at some length Rene Hague's Dai Greatcoat, a volume of Jones's letters to four correspondents with linking commentary by Hague. The review of that book was intended in part to function as an introduction to the letters and excerpts now re- printed in the Notre Dame English Journal Hague tells us in his preface that his early plan for Dai Greatcoat 'changed as it was being put to- gether.' He had at first intended something more in the nature of a proper biography which was to have been generously illustrated by the letters. As he worked away at the mass of correspondence, 'the material itself took control and determined the form. It very soon became clear that, left to himself, David would both record the progress of his life . . . and at the same time portray his character and personality.' What we have in Dai Greatcoat is, therefore, very much 'a self-portrait' with some consid- erable stress on the article. The letters, with several exceptions, are ad- dressed to Hague himself, to Harman Grisewood, to Tom Burns, and to H. S. Ede. The letters to Hague and to Grisewood dominate the selection: there are forty-six letters to Grisewood and thirty to Hague, while there are only thirteen letters to Ede and twelve to Burns. Reading through the one hundred letters of the Ede correspondence at the same time I was reading Hague's book, it seemed to me that even a slight adjustment in the volume of the proportion of letters to these four old friends - forty-six to Ede, for example, and thirteen to Grisewood - would alter the features of the self- portrait to some subtle degree. Dai Greatcoat is not just a matter of leav- ing David Jones to himself to 'both record the progress of his life . . . and . . . portray his character and personality.' That would be the achieve- ment of a Collected Letters. Hague's shaping hand - and not just 'the ma- terial itself - is very much at work in this book, and, though Hague is not quite a biographer, he is perhaps a kind of artist. The purpose of publish-</page><page sequence="2">130 Matthias Journal ing further material from the Ede correspondence in PN Review was two- fold: first, simply to make available more letters from what I found to be a fascinating corespondence; second, to modify slightly the version of David Jones one encounters in Dai Greatcoat. They are republished now chiefly so that American readers who are interested in David Jones will be able to see them. Thanks are due to PN Review, the Kettle's Yard Com- mittee and the Trustees of the estate of David Jones for permission to re- produce letters from this correspondence which now resides at Kettle's Yard, Cambridge (and which was initially catalogued there by Diana Matthias in 1977). x H. S. (Jim) Ede was an early collector of David Jones's visual work and an enthusiastic and selfless supporter of Jones's work in various me- dia from the time of the first letter (in 1927) , and doubtless before, to the end of Jones's life. In his introduction to Kettle's Yard: an Illustrated Guide (reprinted from the 1970 Kettle's Yard Handlist), Ede says that Jones 'brought shape to the ephemeral in me' and that 'his profound vision of essential truth supported me. He had a tolerance not usual in artists and this enlarged my vision.' Writing more recently about his old friend in the 1975 Kettle's Yard memorial exhibition catalogue, Ede expands on his remarks in the Illustrated Guide: An outstanding quality of David Jones was his humaneness, his ability to be at one with human beings, and when he came to paint a picture from himself, he called it 'Human being'. There is in it a great feeling of a personality, of someone sensitive to an outside world, material and spiritual; of someone with a strange force which comes, not out of the strength of his body, but from the strength of his intentions; eyes which collect things inwardly, a body, still yet alert, and fingers which are sensitive instruments at his commanding. An ear too, it also is receptive, and David Jones's more than most. With all this he became the greatest water-colourist and engraver of his day - one of the outstanding poets too, and one rightly compared to Blake. Like him, he is essentially an artist and every thought which goes through him must turn to art. He has a great appreciation of concrete things, and in seeing the actual world he sees more than the actual world. His touch with reality, as much as that of any living artist I know, goes back to a well of essential life, that grand unchanging re- ality which underlies the changing actuality of the world, which at clear moments our quickest apprehensions see. Jim Ede himself, like David Jones, served in the First World War. Fol- lowing the war, he was first at the Slade School and then (as 'photogra- pher's boy') at the National Gallery. Between 1922 and 1935 he was an</page><page sequence="3">David Jones: Letters to H. S. Ede 131 Assistant at the Tate Gallery where he attempted to kindle interest in the work of Ben and Winifred Nicholson, Kit Wood, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska (whose biography he wrote), and David Jones. In 1936 Ede left England to live in Morocco and later, between 1952 and 1956, in France. During these years he also travelled widely in America lecturing on art. In 1956 he was awarded the Legion d'Honneur. Returning to England he founded Kettle's Yard in Cambridge in 1957, realising his dream 'of somehow creating a living place where works of art could be enjoyed, inherent to the domestic setting, where young people could be at home unhampered by the greater austerity of the museum or public art gallery and where an informality might infuse an underlying formality.' In Introducing David Jones I have called Kettle's Yard 'a visual, tactile equivalent for David Jones' accumulating written works' where the stones, pictures, sculptures and objects which Ede has assembled in his house [become his] anathe- mata' Though I do not think I am alone in feeling that this correspond- ence exists between the walled off spaces of the house and the bounded, wattled areas of David Jones's books, evidently no one had mentioned this connection before to Ede himself, for he wrote to me in some surprise upon receiving a copy of the book to say: 'Yes, it is my AnathemataV Re- gretting deeply that David Jones was never able to 'see it all' he adds - 'I know it was his house, &amp; wished he could come, but by 1970 he hardly ever stirred abroad.' The 1970 Kettle's Yard Handlist catalogues thirteen works by David Jones owned by Kettle's Yard, while the new Illustrated Guide lists five works presently on display, including the important Vexilla Regis pur- chased by Jim Ede's mother in 1949 to whom Jones writes one of the most interesting letters in Rene Hague's collection elucidating the work. It is natural, given Ede's orientation and interests, that much of this corre- spondence should concern itself with the visual arts. Hague's initial selec- tion in Dai Greatcoat is taken from the first half of the formal 'Life' that Jones wrote for Ede in 1935. Hague does not, however, print the three paragraphs which conclude this chronology and commentary. Though they have been published before (in the memorial exhibition catalogue), they constitute a sufficiently general statement of certain constants in David Jones's work and thought that I feel it will be useful to begin this selection by printing them once more. I should like to speak of the quality which I rather associate with the folk-tales of Welsh or other Celtic derivation, a quality congenial and significant to me which in some oblique way has some connection with what I want in painting. I find it impossible to define, but it has to do</page><page sequence="4">132 Matthias Journal with a certain affection for the intimate creatureliness of things - a care for, and appreciation of, the particular genius of places, men, trees, animals, and yet withal a pervading sense of metamorphosis and muta- bility. That trees are men walking. That words 'bind and loose material things.' I think Carroll's Alice Books and The Hunting of the Snark inherit, through what channel I do not know, something akin to this particular quality of the Celtic tales. The Snark is always a Boojum in Celtic legend, and tragically so in much Celtic history. The Hunting of the Snark has for me an affinity to the Gododdin of Aneirin and the Hunting of the boar Trwyth in the Olwen tale, and the Grael Quest also. Interestingly enough, the English Folk-Song commencing There were three jovial Welshmen' seems to pay tribute to this thing. In any typ- ical English hunting song the huntsmen meet to hunt the fox, they hunt a fox, and they kill a fox. But the three jovial Welshmen meet to hunt a mortal creature: but at the 'view' the thing hunted turns out to be a 'ship a-sailing' which turns out to be the moon, which turns out to be made of cheese - I forget the sequence, and the detail, but it is interest- ing in this connection. I know nothing of the antiquity of this song or its history. If you would draw a smith's arm think of the twisted black-thorn bough - get at some remove from your subject. If you would paint a wedding group concern your mind with the Marriage supper of the Lamb. If you would draw a bruiser don't neglect to remember the fra- gility of 'this flesh' or you will be liable to make only a vulgar tour-de- force and to obscure the essential humanity of your gross man. There should be always a bit of lion in your lamb. The successful art work is one where no ingredient of creation is lost, where no item on the list in the Benedicite Omnia Opera Dominum is denied or forgotten. This is not easy. It was, I believe, the greatest Welsh poet of the 14th century who remarked of the falling snow, that the angels were at their white joinery in heaven, that the saints were plucking their geese. It is important to be anthropomorphic, to deal through and in the things we understand as men - to be incarnational. To know that a beef-steak is neither more nor less 'mystical' than a diaphanous cloud. God loves both. The painter more than any man must know that the green grass on the hill and the fairy ring are both equally real. He must deny nothing, he must inte- grate everything. But he must only deal with what he loves, and there- fore knows, at any given time. He will come a cropper if he tries to be more understanding or inspired than he really is. Let him love more and more things. 'It is better to love than to know' is his golden rule. He does not experiment like a man of science. As Picasso says, 'He does not seek, he finds.' A little more than a year and a half before Jones outlined his 'Life' for Ede, he discussed at some length, evidently at Ede's request, what he re- garded to be the essentially British constituents of British art. He remarks</page><page sequence="5">David Jones: Letters to H. S. Ede 133 that 'there is something in [Ede's] idea about Englishmen - Doing this stuff in private &amp; attics &amp; all that. They make love in the same fashion, as compared with Frogs and Mediterranean basin chappies, perhaps - but how vague.' He continues (in part) : Of all the complex affairs this takes the cake. I've only just tried to call to mind the bits of things that seem to me the high spots of what / feel characteristic in the arts of this complex island - it's to me always a 'loving handled texture' free-flowing affair with a bit of thunder-storm- behind-an-apple-tree - linear - tentative - not large - packed with life, a bit of a joke - speckled - like a large thrush's breast &amp; spear points in a garden. All this again is obviously futile but yet you would not, I think, be able to make this list fit say German - French - Italian Art - would you? It's the work of a motley race with Kent gardens and Capel-y-Ffin darknesses within a day's walk. Perhaps - it's a patch- work quilt, in a way, on the bed of a princess, with a dead dog on the mat. In scarlet town where I was born &amp; the Cruel Ship's Carpenter, &amp; all that. No less than this battle fares like to the morning's war - I rather fancy that the Bros Adams get a kind of English thing in the how-ever-so-much-derived-from-Europe classicism (like Dick Wilson) &amp; I think that our Ben [Nicholson] even when he thinks he's most 'Paris' &amp; what not, has it very markedly - I think that the great 18th c Eng. paintings - that is to say what is reckoned 'English art' &amp; what I sup- pose floods Burlington House - is the counterpart to the same English- bible-Milton business. . . . The Eng. Bible, Milton, the Puritan Revolu- tion, the Jacobeans, Pope - anything you like - 'Ann' civilization, the whole 18th Cent business, God knows are England enough - but a great foreign influence seems to have all but strangled the particular quality we seem to all recognize electric from the remote past - Celtic-Anglo- Saxon - to make you weep in the early middle age - Still there in parts, later, but heavier or something (in eg. the Morte Arthur) &amp; then [happy,] [prouder,] conscious, &amp; having a regular fine old fling in our William &amp; Co., Donne a bit - &amp; the Stuart needle work Kit Smart, Coleridge, the Romantic Revival picked it up by half - Blake with both hands &amp; feet &amp; so violently as to remould it into some quite other thing - immensely great &amp; alone - but it was 'all British' raw material. I think some of the Pre-Raphaelites 'recognized' the thing but for some reason or other &amp; many reasons, just got every cart before all the wrong horses &amp; so - bloody pathetic affair. . . . Jones characteristically qualifies his observations - especially those re- garding the English Bible, Milton, and eighteenth-century art - by calling them 'ill-put, open to every wrong interpretation ... &amp; not to be taken at all literally.' But for him, he says, there is a 'truth lurking' here. On Friday, 20 March 1936 Jones writes to Ede from the Fort Hotel in Sidmouth about the European political situation and the typescript of In</page><page sequence="6">134 Matthias Journal Parenthesis. He has not been feeling well lately, he says, having caught a bad cold from Eric Gill who had recently been visiting. I agree about the European situation. Pray God it may turn out to be a 'good thing.' - I fear the French - &amp; French pressure - if only we could talk fairly, calmly, &amp; generously to the Germans* - it's what everybody one meets desires - from illiterate men one meets in pubs, to men of position, to men of intelligence - almost without exception - it's the only sane thing. But the devious ways of politicians - how can one tell what they will do? or what 'interests' are behind it all. However one does hope &amp; hope for the best. God grant we shan't be disappointed. (Left and right margin: *I thought Von Ribbentrop's speech at the League assembly most awfully good &amp; convincing - absolutely reason- able. Are people you meet in London taking this view?? - Damn this legalistic attitude of the Frogs &amp; some of our people - why can't we make a great &amp; generous gesture without 'terms' of any sort - it's al- ways the best thing.) . . . I'm working on the typescript of my book - it's got so far - the stages seem endless - &amp; now with all this trouble brewing it seems a foolish book - but perhaps we shall have a breather of peace &amp; then it can be published - it seems terribly bad in places - in most places in fact - but I'm incapable now of forming a judgment. I would like to write a long letter but can't, must catch post &amp; write two other letters as well. . . . Jones writes again from the Fort Hotel on St David's Day, 1937. After his characteristic apologies about not having written often enough, he turns to the subject of his painting, 'Rock Sheep', about which Ede had enquired. Alluding to the 'neurasthenia' which had resulted in a severe breakdown in 1932 and would result in another in 1946, he wonders if he will 'ever get really well.' Of course I should love you to have the Rock Sheep. I left it in charge of Prudence [Pelham] &amp; will write to her &amp; ask her where it is &amp; to send it to you. - I think she is in Sussex at the moment &amp; the picture, I ex- pect, is in London. It is awfully nice of you to want to have it. That will be nice to think of you having it. I do wish I could see you. Do you know it is a monstrous thing but it was only last week I sent your brother the Am. alternate set of engravings &amp; the extra ones I promised him last year. - I did feel an awful swine for not doing this before. Have you seen Faber's spring list with my book announced in it? I did not send you one because I thought you would be sure to see it. It has an embarrassing 'blurb' but there it is. There will also be a prospectus for it later on &amp; I will send you one of those. Dick de la Mare would send you a spring list if you wanted to see it - it comes on p. 55 &amp; Rene [Hague] 's translation of 'Roland' is announced too on p. 58. The printing arrangements are taking a terrible time &amp; I've only just</page><page sequence="7">David Jones: Letters to H. S. Ede 135 got the proofs of the first two- parts &amp; sent them back corrected. It may sound incredible but I've been still working on it quite a lot one way or another - while waiting for proofs etc. There seems no end to what one can do to a thing - &amp; you shudder to think how bad it must have been before you made these necessary corrections &amp; rearrangements, dele- tions, additions, - tiny things - but terribly important. It is St. David's Day to-day &amp; I ate leeks for lunch &amp; walked on a snow capped hill above the sea. - It was a bloody cold wind but the snow was nice in patches with grass and brambles in between &amp; the sea like a leaden plain, now it is sunny. I have been fairly depressed &amp; dis- tracted actually - but no matter. I'm better than I used to be but wonder often if I shall ever get really well. All right if nothing happens to stir the old stuff up again, or frighten me, or exhaust me - a pretty poor lookout in so rocky a world! Yes - London must be awful - I hate to think of it Glad the Rock thing went off alright. Helen Sutherland] wrote just before you went &amp; was very pleased you were going. No news for you, I think. - let me see - Eric [Gill] fell off his great scaffold &amp; broke his rib, &amp; lay in pain on his stone floor - but he's better now &amp; up &amp; about. It is ages &amp; ages since I wrote to you - &amp; now it's March - &amp; King Ed- ward is gone - God, 1 was angry about all that - I thought he might have done something - but the Lord knows what! When do you prepare to return to Tangier? - I hope I see you before you go. I wonder when I shall paint again. Well Dearest Jim I must stop. &amp; thanks so much for wanting [the] picture. I will write to Prudence, at once, now in fact. At the time of his letter to Ede of 29-30 August 1942, Jones is living at 12 Sheffield Terrace in London and trying to finish The Book of Balaam's Ass, the work he finally abandoned. The letter is sufficiently rich and in- teresting to be worth printing almost entire. Ede himself is at this time liv- ing in Tangier, and has evidently recently returned from one of his Ameri- can lecture tours. I do hope you get this letter. That's one thing that strikes one writing perhaps - one feels the letter will take so long &amp; may never get there at all. But I've always had that thing about chaps far off. It's much easier to write to a chap when he lives in the next street than when he lives far off. I don't know why. Unless of course one writes regularly once a month - that might be easier. Something to continue so to say. Well, I'm alrightish all rightish you know. Such a lot has happened. I think I'm really just the same. I expect if we met in the street tomorrow it would seem as if we'd never been separated. I had to leave Glebe Place* (that was a ghastly blow) last year &amp; came to this boarding house mean- ing to stay for a few weeks but here I am still - a year has past. (Left margin: Torn [Burns] had to give it up because of being abroad &amp; I could not afford to run it &amp; it seemed the best arrangement as things</page><page sequence="8">136 Matthias Journal were then.) Yes, still trying to write the same book - it was going on pretty well a few months ago - but lately no good. No painting alas - it still brings on my old trouble if I do that. It is awful. One gets little nearer understanding this nerve thing really. I mean one may under- stand it a bit better - but there seems no cure really - God it's ten years now since I started that breakdown - it seems impossible. But I'm all right. &amp; certainly a lot better than I used to be, a lot better. I am about as worried about a lot of things as anyone could be, but I mean the ac- tual neurasthenia in most of its manifestations is better, but I can't go into ramifications for that deplorable complaint. It does seem to be able to immobilise as soldiers say, a person indeffinately, even when the more violent &amp; obvious &amp; more outward symptoms have receded. It cer- tainly reduces all one's hopes as to creative work to a bare &amp; shadowy minimum. Not least of its traits is that few people even now have much conception of it &amp; put down a good bit of one's inability to get things done to a kind of inertia of the will, a kind of slackness which is, in part reprehensible - none of which is even remotely true. Well damn, I did not mean to write all this stuff - a pretty fine start after two or three years of silence! Harman [Grisewood] got married in the midst of the London Air blitz in 1940. 1 was half living with him then in King's Road &amp; half the time at Glebe. It was a strange period. Like all immediate things (e.g. the front-line in the last war) it had its points. We had some nice times in those hectic months. His wife is heavenly &amp; they are very happy &amp; live at Richmond in a lovely little 18th (early 18th) century cottage bang on the riverside. I go there for the night sometimes - it reminds me in some ways of your house at Elm Row - only because it's 18th c I suppose - it's minute really &amp; a proper building that ambles &amp; is con- trived - not a damned standardized lifeless construction like our mod- ern stuff mostly is. Harman works very hard, but has an interesting job, still at BBC. We often speak of you. Tom [Burns] is still in Spain, he was home for a few days last autumn. Have not heard from him for two months or so. But I expect he's O.K. Prudence [Branch, nee Pelham] is very ill. She has, alas, Disseminated sclerosis - which is incurable - it's so awful, it is intermittent, but from all accounts is incurable - the [toxine] of it is not yet [filterable] - &amp; causes paralysis in different parts of the body for a certain time, &amp; then lifts for a bit - but in the end it kills one. She is just the same - superbly cheerful &amp; brave &amp; defiant in spite of it all. I do wish it was possible to think that this disease was curable. My father lives permanently in a Nursing Home in Sydenham. He had to give up his little house at Brockley because he got too ill. Had to have a trained nurse always ready to inject stuff, because of his heart being very bad. He is happy &amp; cheerful &amp; they are very kind to him &amp; he was allowed to take some of his belongings so he feels more at home. But there he is a [prisoner] in the nursing home. Fortunately he's al- ways had the most amazingly Xtian &amp; resigned nature so he's really as- tonishingly contented. The war bombed very badly where he lived for</page><page sequence="9">David Jones: Letters to H. S. Ede 137 weeks on end, but did not turn a hair! But probably the night after night of no rest &amp; getting up etc. etc. told on his health at his age (82) &amp; made his heart worse. He also often asks if I've heard from you &amp; wonders how you are. He's very alive to everything &amp; reads a lot. More than he ever did. I go and see him once a week and spend the day there or part of the day. This is one of the reasons why I have stayed in London. I feel I must be near him &amp; travelling is a bit of a curse these days. Ac- tually I've not been out of London at all for two years except quite recently (last week in fact). I went to Pigotts for Petra [Tegetmeier]'s birthday &amp; stayed a week! I went for two days but stayed on, it was very nice there - but strange with dear Eric [Gill] no longer at the helm. They go on fairly well - but of course things are a bit tricky in many ways. Joan [Hague] works like a medieval peasant on the land - she's really astounding &amp; is just as she ever was. Looks jolly nice. Ren6 [Hague] is an Officer in the Air Force, &amp; he was home on leave. It was heavenly seeing him again &amp; cracking some old jokes &amp; having a drink. They also enquired after you both. Was interested about the Pittsburgh professor having heard of my work. I do wish there was more of it. The Tate purchased my Mort D' Arthur picture (Guenever) &amp; another one called 'The Four Queens', of Lancelot asleep under an apple tree &amp; Morgan le Fay &amp; the other girls finding him - I did it last year &amp; got ill again trying to do another one which is still unfinished. But which I still hope to get done sooner or later. O, one piece of nice news. I think the Penguin are going to do a little monograph about me with coloured illustrations &amp; uncoloured ones (they are proposing to do a small series of a few artists) . I hope it all comes off.* (Margin: "It's all at present only getting planned so don't talk about it, as sometimes these things fall through.) Robin Iron- side is writing my thing. He's a nice chap. He's using the 'life' I did for you to help him with the biographical stuff. I suppose you know him. He's the Contemporary Art Society chap &amp; it seems has been interested in my work. It is a bit of a business getting the ones for coloured pho- tography, because I've got none left of my own &amp; the others are a bit scattered, but I think it will be done all right. I don't know of course what kind of thing R.I. will write. I believe he's more interested in my Morte D'Arthur kind of picture than some of my others but I expect it will be all right. Petra is just the same - still beautiful &amp; with her very beautiful chil- dren growing up into yellow-haired girls - the eldest is fourteen or thir- teen I suppose. I met Teddy Wolfe one day in June. He was looking well &amp; unaltered, with a beard, &amp; he, of course, talked a lot of you. Also had lunch with 'Freddie' Graham in Kensington in the winter &amp; said I would go again but never have, I must. Saw Ben [Nicholson] also a month or so ago - up from Cornwall. He still works on his abstracts etc. - he's done some jolly good ones. I liked seeing him again &amp; found him very nice, &amp;, I think, a bit more 'human' - not that I think he was ever 'inhuman' - but somehow more tolerant or friendly or something - it's difficult to express.</page><page sequence="10">138 Matthias Journal (Margins: Henry Moore has done some superb drawings of chaps in air-raid shelters - the best things he's ever done. God be praised! They are somehow 'romantic' in the true sense. English artists are 'Ro- mantic' or nothing - I'm sure of that. Even old Ben is really romantic, in spite of the appearance of [Bosh] 'intelligence' - the old Frogs are really intelligent when they paint - we can't do it that way - what aw- ful generalisations one goes in for - sorry. . . . I've been seeing Ken- neth Clark once or twice lately in connection with the Penguin thing - I do find him most awfully nice. He is doing a great work in England under war conditions for the arts, I do think. He's so awfully under- standing &amp; able at the same time.) ... I liked your description of the scenery of San Francisco - it's fascinating about all that primaeval shifting etc. of land - I like to think of these slow-moving mutations &amp; the great slow deep stuff under the transitory things we see &amp; live among. During the 1940s Jones suffered considerably from financial worries, and in 1944 Ede proposed a scheme of support which would help to make him more secure. There are several letters going into considerable detail about various gifts and contributions from Jones's friends and patrons. In a letter written on 9 August 1944, when he was staying as a guest of the Hagues at Pigotts, he concludes: I think that is all there is to tell you about my means of subsistence - apart from the odd sums from sale of older pictures etc. which, with Helen [Sutherland] 's and Tom [Burns] 's contributions have, so far, kept me going. I feel my words must sound exceedingly flat &amp; ungrate- ful &amp; taking-things-for-granted. But it is not really like that &amp; I do in- deed thank you &amp; all of them for all the great kindness. I wish I could see you in person &amp; talk - but that does not seem possible at present. If in some way, you could thank yourself, &amp; those concerned, for me, I should be most grateful. . . . I hoped I might do some drawing during the month I've been here but I can't seem to concentrate on much but my book &amp; I get on with, or try to get on with that, as there is such an enormous lot to do to it. God knows if it's any good or not. Dear Harman and Margaret [Grise- wood] came down for a week and Harman digged all the time in the garden &amp; was very pleased to get a breather from his exacting work in London. They've gone now and I miss him most awfully Jim, I don't know what else to say about this: I hope I do right in accepting what you've planned - I feel very ungenerous &amp; careless in the face of this generosity. The Normandy war seems to be going O.K. Perhaps, who knows, we may be getting somewhere near toward the close. By 1946 Jones has abandoned The Book of Balaam's Ass and is work-</page><page sequence="11">David Jones: Letters to H. S. Ede 139 ing on The Anathemata. A letter written to Ede on 23 August of that year from Cockley Moor, Helen Sutherland's home, records an early private reading from the new work-in-progress at which Kathleen Raine was present. Vera [Moore] is here &amp; is giving a special music thing tonight &amp; Kath- leen Raine is here &amp; her two children - it's a very nice party. I do wish I could do some better paintings. I'm jolly rusty I suppose or it may be I shan't be able to do the old kind again - this writing may have done something to me. I'd much rather paint than write if only I could. I hope you are right about this new writing. I do indeed. I read some of it to Kathleen Raine &amp; Helen &amp; Vera (by special request!) last night. They seem to like it quite a bit, but I'm afraid it's damned obscure. Helen has made this place inside very lovely &amp; Ben [Nicholson] 's pic- tures look good here - outside it's wild &amp; remote but within it has all Helen's civilized feeling just as Rock had. I go back to London in the second week of September &amp; then I think I shall go to Pigotts for a little while all being well. This is my first time right away from London for seven years - jolly odd thought. But it does not seem to matter awfully where one is - but still, in some ways it does I went to dinner at the Clark's a few weeks back &amp; saw again my big picture of Petra [Teget- meier]. They were awfully nice &amp; a jolly nice house, &amp; he has some lovely pictures. Jones's second major breakdown occurred at Cockley Moor at about the same time as the letter of 23 August. By spring, 1947 he had entered Bowden House in Harrow. It was not until May of 1948, however, that Jones wrote to Ede explaining what had happened. I'm terribly sorry for this intolerable delay in answering your letter &amp; for not writing at all for so long - but it is only during the last few months that I've been able to write. I don't know when you last heard from Tom [Burns], but what happened was that last spring (1947) I got a lot worse &amp; went to a Nursing Home here in Harrow &amp; was there all the summer &amp; autumn until Xmas time. I received treatment, psy- chotherapy, &amp; they did me a great deal of good &amp; got me painting again. I came to this house which is kept by an ex-master of Harrow school in January &amp; have been drawing etc. &amp; am having a show of a few things at the Redfern Gallery commencing on May 24th, until June 26. I still have to see the doctor as yet once a week but I'm infinitely bet- ter than I was last year. I was very sad to hear you may have to give up your house - I am indeed &amp; terribly sorry that you won't be coming to England this summer. Gosh! How difficult all this money thing is get- ting now for everybody. I don't believe I could design a textile at all - I have not got enough sense of the 'abstract' to do that. My thing is dif- ferent from that. I suppose I might mess about with a complicated</page><page sequence="12">140 Matthias Journal theme &amp; get bits of feeling into it here &amp; there with chalk &amp; paint &amp; pen- cil &amp; spit &amp; rubbings out etc. - but I can't imagine myself being able to get anything with a straight clear pattern which could be interpreted in textile no. I do wish I had written to you before - I feel very guilty about that - I think of you both so often. - I wish you lived in England - but there it is - I do hope I get a bit of money out of this show. - but I don't imagine it can be much what with the 33 1/3 to Gallery &amp; the mounting &amp; framing &amp; the income tax - [ ] it is wonderful to have been even well enough to paint at all after this long long long unwellness. I'm also try- ing to get on with my book but it is very difficult &amp; complicated &amp; won't get fixed or finished. I had hoped to have a publishable bit really fixed &amp; right long before this. Lately I've done none of it because of this attempt to get some painting done for this show. We decided to have the show in October - but quite suddenly decided to have it now instead - so you can imagine the last minute scamper! I've been writing out invitation cards &amp; stamping them until I pretty much hate the sight of them - one can never find anyone's address. Anyway, most of that is done now. I would love to see you both. God bless you &amp; I do thank you for all you are doing &amp; have done. The Artists' Benevolent gave me some money round about the time I left the [actual] nursing home which was a great help as I had huge bills in that place - but it is wonderful that the doc- tors have been able to do what good they have. I was fortunate in being under awfully understanding &amp; good man called Dr Stevenson &amp; it is he to whom I still go at present once a week. I must stop-- I simply must try &amp; write to you more regularly now I'm better than I was - much &amp; much love to you &amp; to dear Helen &amp; the girls - where are they? let me know how all things go with you. In December of 1949 Jones wrote from Northwick Lodge in Harrow- on-the-Hill where he lived from the time he left Bowden House in 1947 until he moved to the Monksdene Hotel in 1964. He has not been too bad, he tells Ede - 'ups &amp; downs'. Done very little painting I fear - been trying hard to get my writing nearer completion though it's still a long way off. Been doing a good bit of sorting out etc. &amp; getting room a bit more ship-shape - had some shelves made (with great difficulty) &amp; got my books in them &amp; various bits &amp; pieces. A mug &amp; glass or two as for instance the 18th cent. Ger- man glass you gave me once &amp; a few other oddments about the room - it looks a lot nicer &amp; I'm glad to have them &amp; be able to look at them. - Possible inducement to 'still-life' drawings - I hope - &amp; some of my old pictures on the walls Glad you've been reading Hopkins* - / think he's superb &amp; more interesting to me than almost any poet for centuries. He really understood what poetry was all about &amp; how it is a made thing with a shape - He really 'makes' his poems in a way that can be</page><page sequence="13">David Jones: Letters to H. S. Ede 141 said of few poets. (Margin: *He had a very great influence on me - however unworthily &amp; feebly employed in my stuff.) Glad you had the [playing] &amp; Vera [Moore] &amp; also seen Brancusi, &amp; that Helen has been able to do some [playing]. It was good seeing you both again &amp; Elizabeth that day - sorry it was not for longer - it was quite like old times, as they say &amp; you all seemed just the same - thank God. They are plowing the fields that you could see from my window - it is an illusion of real country almost. I don't know what they are going to grow, corn, I hope. That will be very nice later on &amp; I shall be able to sing 'John Barley Corn' to myself Glad, so glad, you like some of the pictures - I feared you would think them pretty mouldy. I wish I could do some / really like - one seldom seems to turn the cor- ner one wants to turn. Some of the old ones did - or so I feel in retro- spect but it's hard to know No news really; not seen anybody for some time nor been to London. Dear Harman I see once a week if possible but lately either I've not been well or some other hitch has occurred [so] our sequence of lunches has been interrupted - but probably next week I'll see him - which I always look forward to more than anything. How old we are all getting - I was thinking the other day that I've known you for over 20 years &amp; Harman for just about the same time &amp; Tom [Burns] for a few years longer ( 1923) . I've not seen Tom either for a few weeks but he was all right &amp; his family when last I saw him but very busy &amp; rushed - business &amp; the home etc. etc. How bloody lucky one is to have such nice friends. I see that they've made Gerald Kelly the successor to [Munnings] at the R.A. What a lot [of] balls all that stuff is. But I imagine G.K. is a more cultivated person than [Munnings], for what it's worth. It is a rum world that so-called 'academic' painting world.* (Margin: *it seems to be fundamentally bogus - a vast misapprehension of the na- ture of the arts &amp; [a] thing that has outlived its meaning &amp; use.) Ede received his copy of The Anathemata immediately upon its publi- cation and wrote to Jones that he was struggling with it. In his letter from Northwick Lodge of 16 November 1952 Jones writes about his use of 'Leir' and 'Lear' in the text of The Anathemata, and about what sort of use Ede should make of the notes. Leir and Lear are the same. Leir is the form used by Geoffrey of Mon- mouth &amp; others from whom Shakespeare got his stuff. In fact it may be spelt Leir in Shakespeare's First Folio, but I don't know &amp; have no means of checking it as I now write. But Leir it is in Geoffrey of Mon- mouth, or at least in the first English translation of Geoffrey's Latin text made in 1718 by Aaron Thompson, a first edition copy of which I hap- pen to possess. 'Leir's river' may mean the Thames just as 'Lear-sea' means the seas round this island. The Welsh is Llyr &amp; the Irish Lir. He was a Celtic God of the elements - sea etc. So Shakespeare was continu-</page><page sequence="14">142 Matthias Journal ing a very ancient tradition in associating 'King Lear1 with the tempest &amp; storm. (Margin: I used the two forms deliberately to convey the suc- cessive layers of tradition that cling to the name. Though as the work is meant to be said the difference in spelling doesn't mean much. But it does do something when you see it printed on the same page.) I suggest in reading Ana that the best way is to take no notice of the notes except in the case of pronunciation of Welsh words. Read it once just as you would the Book of Isaias or, for that matter, Tit-Bits, or the Nicene Creed. The notes are best consulted separately. They are not in- tended to bolster up the text. That would be artistically indefensible. They are a quite separate commentary &amp; are only added for the reasons explained in the preface. At the Midsummer Banquet of 1968 David Jones was officially awarded the first Midsummer Prize of £1500 by the Lord Mayor of London. Looking back at the day he was notified about his award, Jones charm- ingly describes the surprise visit of the Lord Mayor's men to his room at the Monksdene Hotel in his penultimate letter to Ede of 21 February 1970. I was amused that you imagined I had gone to that Mansion House Banquet - No, I wasn't up to that, they most kindly sent me the prize and indeed were extremely understanding about my not being there to receive it in person - though I felt pretty awful about not being able to go. I was also absolutely astounded when they told me I was to be the recipient of it, for I'd never heard of it, it being the first occasion of it being given. They also did it in a very civilized manner. Not by letter, but two nice chaps on the Lord Mayor's staff came one day, out of the blue, &amp; handed me a letter asking me if I was willing to receive the award. When I saw the arms of the City of London on the seal of a very large envelope, I thought &amp; said Good God, what can this be. &amp; the young man said, Don't be alarmed, open it and see. On 31 December 1971, Jones wrote his last letter to Ede in response to some questions he had raised about the Vexilla Regis, the large water- colour-drawing which Jones completed at Bowden House and which Ede's mother had bought in 1949 following its exhibition at the Redfern Gallery in May and June of the previous year. The letter should be read as an ex- tension of certain points made in the letter to Mrs. Ede of 28 August 1949 which Rene Hague publishes in Dai Greatcoat. It was sent from the Cal- vary Nursing Home in Sudbury Hill, Harrow, where Jones had gone fol- lowing his stroke and fall of March 1970. On 30 December Jones had drafted a very long letter to Ede which attempted to answer the questions</page><page sequence="15">David Jones: Letters to H. S. Ede 143 he raised. Finding the next morning that 'it meanders on about all sorts of stuff but fails to answer the questions,' he begins again. I have with me here only a much reduced reproduction of Vexilla Regis in half-tone, plate VI in David Blamires book David Jones Artist &amp; Writer published this summer by the Manchester University Press. Have you read it? I cannot see much of the details at all plainly - nat- urally, using the necessary reduction. But I can make out in top right hand corner a descending bird with outstretched wings &amp; a rising bird to meet and salute it - presumably a kind of pleni sunt coeli et terra gloria tua motif. There appears to be another bird in flight emerging from the extreme right corner flying more or less laterally, &amp; I don't know about him, perhaps an attendant of the militia coelestis or just a bird. No, no employment of the crowing cock motif - though I know that at one period in the iconography of the church it played a very im- portant part. The tree on the right (that of the 'bad thing1) terminates with the legionary Aquila &amp; down its length some of those disk-like forms called phalarae that Roman standards carried as battle honours - not a very good idea, sorry that the poor felon was executed by the state at the demands of the priests &amp; rulers of the Sanhedrin. But I could not think of any other way &amp; that's why that stauros is not a tree but stuck into the ground &amp; held upright by wedges. The left hand tree ('good' thing) has in its branches a 'pelican in her piety' on her nest &amp; with her young &amp; feeding them from her own flesh. The heap in the bot- tom left-hand order is meant to be a red sagum or cloak as worn by Roman soldiers &amp; with a garment a bucina* or tuba*, a trumpet left by the guard of the fatigue-party at the place of execution. (Margin: *a bucina was, I understand, one of those large curved trumpets &amp; a tuba more like a straight bugle.) The whole conception is that the 'Dreaming Rood' remains while the, so to say, 'world-forest' whether of nature or culture rise[s] and fall[s]. (Margin: The A.S. poem 'The Dream of the Rood' is now known to have been influenced by the Latin hymn Vexilla Regis.) There is, for instance, a classical statue on the left of the tree of the 'good' thief on her plinth - perhaps the tutelar of the stream (Margin: which actually flows from a spring at the roots of the Central Tree) very near her &amp; there is a 'stonehenge' of sorts - The horses that cross the picture &amp; hasten towards the hills was suggested by a line in Malory - after the death of Gwenhwyf ar &amp; the passing of Arthur &amp; the general break-up. 'And there was none of those other knyghts but they redde in bookes &amp; holpe for to ssynge Mass &amp; range bellys &amp; dyd bodily al maner of servyce, And so their horses wente where they would.' . . . Sorry my tedious effort of yesterday turned out to be no bloody good - God bless you both. You say I owe you two letters, I expect I</page><page sequence="16">144 Matthias Journal do but I spend all day about every day trying to cope with some work [ ] muddled with piles of correspondence. I feel so damned tired. Two days before I had that bone-smasher of a fall I had a very slight stroke &amp; the weariness may apparently be the result of that. This thing which I thought I'd be recovered from in about six months has in fact tied me up for about eighteen months. I too think of you both even I fail to write. . . . Note 1. Though David Jones's handwriting is usually fairly clear, I am some- times unable to make out certain words, especially when he writes in pencil or green ink. Where I am in doubt about a particular word or group of words I have used brackets, and where I cannot make something out at all I have bracketed two bars of space [ ]. This typographical convention must also serve when it comes to editorial additions, such as surnames. Ellipses indicate where cuts have been made in the text. Some of the letters, in fact, are quite long.</page></plain_text>
