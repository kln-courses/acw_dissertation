<plain_text><page sequence="1">London exhibitions London by CHRISTOPHER GRIFFIN although the history of the moving image in art is, in comparison with other artistic mediums, a relatively short one, the inextricable links that both film and video have to mass culture have ensured that their evolution has been nothing if not speedy, determined by fashions and conventions, as much as by discoveries and innovations. Moreover, the relentless pace at which mov- ing-image technology has advanced, par- ticularly over the past twenty years, has significandy shortened the lifespan of several artistic practices, providing few opportunities to reflect on the accomplishments of work of this kind. Some recent exhibitions in London, however, showing the work of artists at dif- ferent stages of their careers, have provided the opportunity to examine both the history and the future of the moving image in relation to the global hegemony of digital production. For the past thirty years, Pipilotti Rist has been pioneering the use of the audio, visual and psychological faculties of video to create compelling, multi-sensory environments. The survey exhibition of her work at the Hay war d Gallery (to 8 th January) is undoubtedly one of the best shows to be held here for some time, filled with sculptures and installations of various scales that incorporate videos projected onto suspended fabrics, tucked inside seashells and reflected by mir- rors.1 Many of the videos are accompanied by both music and spoken narrative, which can be heard throughout the galleries, merging works together in a way that allows the exhi- bition to be considered a work of art in itself. This sense of immersion is magnified by the installations, which in many cases include specially designed cushions resembling body- parts, inviting the viewer not only to relax, but to be embraced by the imagery. In Admin- istrating eternity (201 1), slow-motion shots of mouths biting into juicy peaches, a bearded man chewing, and fingers running through a child's hair flicker in and out of focus onto 64.

Another giant installation, Lobe of the lung (2009), follows a small pig snuffling its way through a meadow, an earthly paradise saturated in colour, while an earlier work, Digesting impressions (1996), tracks an endoscopic camera as it squirms its way down the oesophagus and through the intestines, screened on a globe-shaped mon- itor suspended inside a yellow swimming costume. The tactility and sensuality of these installations, along with their impression of the body, render them undeniably seductive, addressed in a way that makes you moment- arily believe that the images exist for you and you alone. This effect is advanced by Rist's smallest videos, hidden inside seashells, lettuce leaves and plant pots, which are heard before they are seen, as though calling out for atten- tion. The most famous of these is Selfless in the bath of lava (1994; Fig.64), which consists of a tiny digital screen implanted in the floor, depicting a naked woman screaming up at the viewer, pleading for forgiveness so that she can be saved from the flaming lava below her feet. Though undeniably startling, the absurd- ity of the woman's situation and the viewer's helplessness also make it immensely entertain- ing, heightened by the work's miniature and, therefore, apparendy inconsequential scale. It is scale, of course, or rather the variations of scale offered by Rist's work in general and this exhibition in particular, that makes one aware of one's size, shape and subjectivity, neatly summed up by the protagonist in Suburb brain (1999) who struggles to comprehend the magnitude of 'three thousand years of philo- sophical history [. . .] one hundred and fifty years of psychological history'. Time, after all, is also subject to scale in that it has dimensions, measured by beginnings and ends. While Rist's digital videos are intrinsically time- based, it is analogue film, more so than any other visual medium, that indexically records time, in time and as time. It is a tragic irony, therefore, that for analogue film, time is running out. Analogue film is on the brink of extinction because it is deemed too costly to manufacture in comparison with its digital step-sister. The loss of the medium would mean artists such as Tacita Dean would have to give up doing what they have been doing for an entire career. Unsurprisingly therefore, Dean has been at the forefront of a year-long campaign to draw attention to film's plight, to save the remaining production labs from closure, and reignite the public's love for a medium that in many ways laid the foundation stones of our modern visual culture. The single work she was commissioned to make for the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern (to nth March) is in essence the climax of her campaign, not least because her petitions have so far failed to change the minds of the executive officers who hold the future of analogue film in their hands.2 Projected onto a thirteen-metre-high wooden screen, FILM (Fig. 6 5) is an eleven- minute, self-reflexive meditation on film's distinctive but enigmatic character, perform- ing its illusionistic dexterity (achieved using a colourful array of traditional techniques, including masking, glass matte painting and multiple exposures) with a playful, innocent abandon seemingly at odds with the terminal condition in which its medium finds itself. Images of fountains and mountains, grasshop- pers and bright red tomatoes are punctured with coloured dots that mirror the giant sprockets on both sides of the screen. The back of the Turbine Hall itself appears transformed into a misty cauldron populated by giant floating eggs, then into a Mondrian- style grid of flashing colours. The film, which is silent, eschews narrative and metaphor in favour of pure visual indulgence, making it, in the artist's words, a 'portrait' of film, magnified by the vertical orientation of the screen on which it is projected. As is the case with all portraits, FILM serves a commemora- tive function, accentuated on the one hand by the size of the screen - which is undeniably monumental - and on the other by its shape - which brings to mind that of a grave- stone - both of which imbue the work with a 66.

However, while the accompanying catalogue - which includes contributions by some eighty defenders of analogue film, from artists to filmmakers to theorists - articulates the arguments that need to be made to keep film alive, the work itself simply delights in being alive, as if captivated by the living, breathing world it momentarily depicts. The mesmeric, and at times hypnotic quality of moving images, whether they be analogue or digital, is one to which so many artists and filmmakers, not to mention view- ers, are continually drawn. James Richards's single- work exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery (closed 20th November) comprised both digital material that he himself filmed and found footage from a variety of sources (Fig.66). This he compiled into a melodic but melancholic montage projected onto two sus- pended screens facing each other, in between which were installed seats for the audience, who had to twist backwards and forwards to see both sets of images. Although certainly eclectic - from close-up shots of soapy flesh to night-vision footage of galloping deer, from X-rays of a chest cavity to digital animations of anthropomorphic worms - the nineteen- minute suite of images was nothing if not engrossing. An absorbing rhythm or pulse was maintained by scenes which were either deliberately protracted - such as a light bulb rocking endlessly on its side - or repeated over and over again - such as a three-second clip of a cigarette butt dropping to the ground. The attention paid by both the images and the editing to the passing of time was echoed by the soundtrack, which included a poem by Judy Grahn, read at a slow tempo that lament- ed the loss of her youth ('Was I not ruling, guiding, naming / Was I not brazen, crazy, chosen'), and a psychedelic folk song by The Incredible String Band: 'Oh ah ее oo there's absolutely no strife / Living the timeless life / I don't need a wife / Living the timeless life'. Several maxims have led us to believe that timelessness is the preserve of art, and so it is indeed to the institution of art - the museum - that analogue film must retreat if it is to survive. But as these examples demonstrate, it is just as important for the museum to take responsibility for entertaining the present and future of the moving image as it is to accom- modate its history. As the world becomes ever more saturated with fast-paced, on-screen media, artists are looking for alternative ways of presenting and displaying moving-image work outside the cinematic black box. For contemporary film and video, therefore, space has become as important a feature as time. 1 Catalogue: Pipilotti Rist: Eyeball massage.
