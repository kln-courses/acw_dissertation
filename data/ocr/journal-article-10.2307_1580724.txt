<plain_text><page sequence="1">IBN 'ARABI BETWEEN "PHILOSOPHY" AND "MYSTICISM" "Sufism and Philosophy are neighbors and visit each other" fa-inna at-tasawwuf wa-t-tafalsuf yatajdwardni wa-yatazdwardni* by Franz Rosenthal Hamden, Conn. It needs hardly any comment that the terms "philosophy" and "mysticism" require definition in order to realize the difference between them (and between mysticism and religion). There are no doubt many who would deny the existence of suitable clearcut distinctions. In Islam, "philosophy" can be considered as equivalent to what Muslims themselves designated with a loanword from the Greek,falsafah. The curious modern term "mysticism" has no such direct identifying connection between Arabic and a second language. In Arabic, tasawwuf was the label for a diverse and, eventually, all-pervasive religious and societal movement that touched intellectuals and the social elite as well as the masses. It is not always absolutely clear why an individual was considered a faylasuf or a sufi, or into which category he might fall according to our understanding of philosophy and mysticism. Ibn 'Arabi (1165-1240) represented, by general agreement, a Sufi approach to the universe in his thought and attitude. He himself would not have denied it, but such a broad classification would have been unacceptable to him without further modification. He thought of himself as a special kind of SufT, and others tended to follow this view of himself. "Sufism," without further * Abui Hayyan at-Tawhidi, al-Basd'ir wa-dh-dhakha'ir, ed.

The following pages were originally prepared for a colloquium on Philosophy and Mysticism organized by Giles Constable and Isadore Twersky and held at Dumbarton Oaks (Washington, D.C.) on November 13-15, 1983. My participation in the colloquium gave me the opportunity to spend many months just reading again through the colossal aeuvre of Ibn 'Arabi and being fascinated by it, even if the poetry of the language and the depth of its ideas often appear to defy what we like to think of as rationality. My exposition here is meant to be purely descriptive, not interpretative or historical. The innumerable obvious parallels to earlier Muslim thought are not expressly noted. The vast amount of recent research on Ibn 'Arabi is the subject of an illuminating survey by J.W. Morris, in JAOS, 106 (1986), 539-51 and 733-56. I regret I missed Ibn 'Arabi's work on logic, al-Bulghah fj l-hikmah, for which see E. Meyer, in A. Zimmermann (ed.), Aristotelisches Erbe, 125-40 (Berlin 1986).</page><page sequence="2">Franz Rosenthal qualification, was not enough to characterize his particular position satisfacto- rily. For him, the "men of God" fall into three classes. In the first place, there were practical ascetics of the highest moral character called 'ubbdd "worship- pers." They are represented on the literary scene by men such as al-Muhasibi. In the second, next higher category, there were people who were equivalent to the first group in all respects, but in addition they were concerned only with God, and they achieved states and stations, secrets, revelations (kushufj) and miracles, as well as futiwah status. They are called Sufis, and they also claim leadership of all the people of God and think of themselves as something special. And the third category, finally, encompasses those called Malamiyah.2 They observe all religious obligations most punctiliously, but in no way do they distance themselves from the common pedple. They tend toward blaming themselves and being blamed by others, yet, they are in perfect accord with God's lordship, and they possess that perfect divine and human wisdom (hikmah) that consists in assigning to each phenomenon its proper place.3 The Prophet and Abu Bakr belonged into this third and highest category, as did quite a few of older as well as contemporary mystics.4 Ibn 'Arabi does not indicate into which category he placed himself. It might be assumed that he claimed to belong to all three of them, but, as far as I can see, he does not expressly claim to belong to the third. In other contexts, he speaks of himself as belonging to the Sufis of true insight (muhaqqiql as-Siufryah).s The Sufi who combines true insight (muhaqqiq)-in this particular case, insight into the mysteries of letters-with loving concern ranks higher than ordinary Sufis.6 Ibn 'Arabi assumed the existence of two kinds of Sufis, those who are truthful possessors of the truth, and those who make such a claim without having any real understanding.7 Indeterminate numbers of Sufis exhibit the highest standards of ethical behavior (makarim al-akhlaq), and it is said that I The terms corresponding in a way to something like divine inspiration were many in Ibn 'Arabi's vocabulary, among them kashf, tajalli, fath, wahb, etc. 2 Ibn 'Arabi considers Malamiyah preferable to Malamatiyah, see Fut., II, 16, 1. 15 (ch. 73). The Futiuht al-Makkryah are quoted here as Fut. according to the edition Cairo 1329, except for the introduction and chapters 1-71 (= I, 665, 1. 7, of the Cairine text), for which the first nine volumes of the edition of 'Uthman Yahya (Cairo 1392/1972-) were available. Yahya's edition is referred to as "Fut. Y." 3 See below, n. 57, and Fut., II, 16, 11. 15 ff.

Among them is Ibn 'Arabi's venerated exem- plar, al-Ghazzall.11 In another place, Ibn 'Arabi speaks of "intelligent individ- uals and logical thinkers (al-'uqald' wa-ahl al-qiyds)," among them al-Ghaz- zalI, as being his "colleagues (ashdb)."12 He even goes so far as to pair Sufis who have no correct insight with philosophers of similar standing.13 Im sum, it is justified, of course, to speak of Ibn 'Arabi as a Sufi, but he tried to break out of the shapeless mold of Sufism, which by his time had indeed become an almost all-inclusive term. This no doubt influenced his attitude toward philosophy and presumably makes it unrepresentative of Sufism as a whole, at least before the wide spread of Ibn 'Arabi's influence. Ibn 'Arabi considered himself in possession of various forms of personal divine revelation, thus, as a special, higher type of Siufi. Of course, he did not think of himself as a faylasuf, nor did he use the word falsafah in the titles of his works or for describing his own views.14 Throughout the centuries, his opponents could not find enough terms of opprobrium for him, yet, none of them, it seems, went so far as to smear him with the appellation offaylasuf.l1 It is curious that modern scholarship states 8 Fut., II, 17, 11.

Osman Yahia, Histoire et classification de l'euvre d'lbn 'ArabT (Damascus 1964), 308, no. 281 (referring to al-I'ldm bi-ishdrdt ahl al-ilhdm, published Hyderabad 1948), and 362, no. 415. Falsafat al-akhldq, listed by Yahia, 198, no. 124, printed in Cairo 1332, was not available to me. It has been recognized as a work by Yahya b. 'Adi, cf., for instance, G. Endress, The Works of Yahya Ibn 'Adi, 83 f. (Wiesbaden 1977). For another Ethics, see below, n. 112. 15 The debate pro and con Ibn 'Arabi has produced a large literature, most of it not yet available in print. It may well be that statements such as this one, based upon the absence of evidence, will turn out to be wrong. 3</page><page sequence="4">Franz Rosenthal that he was referred to as Ibn Afladtn "Son of Plato," presumably to indicate high praise. The origin of the epithet is not known to me. It seems to be unusual terminology. The number of honorifics as well as infamifics applied to Ibn 'Arabi by his admirers and detractors was legion, but even if it should turn out that someone used "Son of Plato," it certainly was not one of the designations commonly applied to him.16 He himself was proudly content with proclaiming himself a "reviver" and "Muhammad," and the one and concrete essence of his time: It may be mentioned here that some of Ibn 'Arabi's works, though printed, were not available, and others I failed to peruse. The works still unpublished include important texts. Moreover, the question of authenticity often intrudes. I have paid little attention to it here. I have tried, however, to clarify the situation with respect to a unique text contained in the Yale manuscript L-64 (Catalogue Nemoy, no. 1129). It is described as containing Ibn 'Arabi's Jadhwat al-istild' and consists of a collection of statements by old Suifs. Since the work contains chapters on Sifism and tafakkur, it is of some potential interest in our context. Yahia, Histoire et classification, 260, no. 159, has expressed doubt about Ibn 'Arabi's authorship, since the work is obviously different in style and spirit from his other works. It is indeed unusual for Ibn 'Arabi not to inject his personality into a text of this size (but compare his Muhidarat al-abrir, below, p. 17). The first eight folios and the title-page containing the author's name and the title of the work are in a hand later than the rest of the manuscript. At the end, the scribe mentions that he copied the text in a (!) SumaysatT Ribat in Damascus as a "tadhkirah li-sdhibihi, the shaykh, imam, scholar, and ascetic Najib(?)-ad-din Jamal at-ta'ifah, Thaghr (?, hardly Maqarr/Mafarr) al- ghuraba' al-AbharL." Li-sdhibihf may mean for his colleague/master/friend, as he refers to him again in the formulas of blessing. Conceivably, it might indicate al-Abhari as the author of the work. It depends on whether the autograph at the end (Catalogue Nemoy, plate VI) is indeed by the hand of Ibn 'Arabi, which I have so far been unable to check by comparison with other autographs. The only AbharT at this time located by me is Hujjat-ad-dln-al-haqlqi 'Abd-al-Muhsin (Muhassin) b. Abi l-'Amid al-Abhari as-Sufi (556-624/1161-1227 in Egypt), who traveled widely, cf. Ibn al-'Imad, Shadhardt, V, 114 (Cairo 1359-51). He could very well have been the author of a work of this type. Ibn 'Arabi's al-Jadhwah al-muqtabasah (Yahia, Histoire et classification, 259, no. 158) can hardly be connected with the Jadhwat al-istilt'. The writer of the title-page of the Yale manuscript is unlikely to have made up the latter peculiar title, but he could easily have added Ibn 'Arabi as the name of the author. 16 This was claimed by M. Asin Palacios, "El mistico Murciano Abenarabl," in Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia (Madrid), 87 (1925), 99. Asin Palacios was followed by H. Corbin, L'Imagination creatrice dans le Soufisme d'lbn 'Arabi, 18 (Paris 1958), English trans. by R. Manheim, 21 (Princeton 1969. Bollingen Series 91). Corbin repeated himself in Multiple Averroes, 325 (Paris 1978. Actes du Colloque International organise a l'occasion du 8501 anniversaire de la naissance d'Averroes, Paris ... 1976). In his preface to R.W. J. Austin's translation of Ibn 'Arabi's Fisuis, The Bezels of Wisdom, xiii (New York-Ramsey-Toronto 1980), T. Burckhardt says that in his day (!), Ibn 'Arabi was given the surname of Son of Plato. His own translation of the Fusus, La Sagesse des Prophetes, 7 (Paris 1955), which had appeared before Corbin's works, had no such reference. No source is given by any of these scholars. If there is one, it may have been one of the numerous commentaries on Ibn 'Arabi's works and, in particular, the Fusus, most of which are not available to me. We can hardly assume that there is here a mixup with as-Suhrawardi al-maqtul. The heretical philosophers who called Pharaoh the "Coptic Plato" used a more appropriate phrase to express themselves, see Ibn Taymiyah, Naqd al-mantiq, ed. M. Hamid al-Fiql, 131 (Cairo 1370/ 1951). 4</page><page sequence="5">Ibn 'Arabi between "Philosophy" and "Mysticism" I am the Muh(y)i. I have no kunyah and no nisbah referring to a place. I am al-'Arabi, al-Hatimi, Muhammad.17 Even though Ibn 'Arabi was not expressly described as a "philosopher," it is true that his writings, or at least some of them, were attacked as tasawwuf al- faldsifah, meaning philosophical mysticism rather than mystic philosophy.18 And although Ibn Khaldun did not mention Ibn 'Arabi by name when he characterized a view of the revelationists (ashab at-tajalll) as "a strange view of philosophical import," he might very well have had him in mind or included him in such a group.19 Modern scholarship has tried to defend the thesis that it is possible to find a system of mystic philosophy or philosophical mysticism20 in Ibn 'Arabi's work. A.E. Affifi's introduction to Ibn 'Arabi published in 1939 was entitled The Mystical Philosophy of Muhyid Din-Ibnul 'Arabi. In the beginning of his preface, however, he issued a slight disclaimer: "... Mystics have no philo- sophical system or fixed doctrines ... Mysticism is essentially an eclectic subject... but Ibnul 'Arabi is an exception to the rule. He has a definite philosophical doctrine of pantheism, the bearing of which is shown in every part of his system. There is also a formal dialectic which dominates the whole of his thought." There are obvious problems with this statement, the principal one being the term "pantheism." It may conceal antiphilosophy and rejection of the very idea of "system." In the earliest of his many works on Ibn 'Arabi, M. Asin Palacios wished to characterize Ibn 'Arabi's cosmology as an "emanational pantheism" composed of Aristotelian and Neoplatonic elements unsuccessfully harmo- nized with Islam, and he spoke of the thought of Ibn 'Arabi as a systematic and harmonious syncretism formed by the juxtaposition of all sorts of philosophical elements and dominated by Alexandrian Neoplatonism.21 Today, it seems still unavoidable to associate Ibn 'Arabi with some vague mystic Neoplatonism or the like22 as if this were a philosophical system of some sort or other. H.S. Nyberg, who wrote what is probably still the most sensible comprehensive study of Ibn 'Arabi, based himself on Ibn 'Arabi's 17 DTwan, 44 (Biulq 1271). A final short i is required in Muhyi by the meter. See also below, n. 187. 18 Cf. Ibn Hajar, Lisan al-Mizan, V, 312 (Hyderabad 1329-31); Inba' VII, 329. 19 Cf. Ibn Khaldun, Shifa' as-sd'il, ed. M. Ibn Tfawt at-Tanji, 58, 11. 11 f. (Istanbul 1957). 20 With regard to "philosophical mysticism," cf., for instance, D.R. Blumenthal on post- Maimonidean Yemeni authors. Blumenthal considers them as representatives of a special "philo- sophical mysticism," see his contribution to G. Nahon and C. Touati (eds.), Hommage a Georges Vajda, 291-308 (Louvain 1980). 21 M. Asin Palacios, "Mohidin," in Homenaje d Menendez y Pelayo, II, 238, 254 (Madrid 1899). 22 As was done most recently, for instance, by M. Cruz Hernandez, Historia delpensamiento en el mundo isldmico, II, 221 ff. (Madrid 1981). 5</page><page sequence="6">Franz Rosenthal most "philosophical" works and considered the formation of a system as something in constant flux in Ibn 'Arabi's head.23 He also spoke of "theo- sophy," which, whatever may be meant by it, is certainly not philosophy. To my mind, "monism" remains a fairly satisfactory term as far as it goes, or better perhaps, "monistic gnosticism." Looking at the problem of Ibn 'Arabi's "system" from inside Islam, Seyyed Hossein Nasr got closer to the truth of the matter. He made short shrift of what he calls the "accusations" raised against Ibn 'Arabi of being a pantheist, panentheist, existential monist, or follower of natural mysticism. "All of these accusations," Nasr says, "are false, however, because they mistake the meta- physical doctrines of Ibn 'Arabi for philosophy and do not take into conside- ration the fact that the way of gnosis is not separate from grace and sanctity." 24 Nasr is not alone in our time in practicing this sort of agnosticism with respect to a "philosophical system" of Ibn 'Arabi. L. Gardet, for instance, contended that in Ibn 'Arabi's case, there can be no question of "a philosophy that has integrated mystic resonances and experiences. It is a case of wisdom gnosis (gnose sapientiale) which commands a spiritual experience that in its very texture is accessible only through recourse to a certain experience." 2 5 Much in all these statements depends on a particular definition und understanding of "philosophy" in order to make sense. It may also be noted that discussions of Ibn 'Arabi's "philosophy" such as that of Affifi read more like discussions of works on Kalam, and there is the general and more fundamental problem of when metaphysics ceases to be part of philosophy. On his part, Ibn 'Arabi, in speaking of the "method (uslib)" of his Futuhdt,26 probably had no fixed system in mind, certainly no system that was in the least "philosophical." We can deduce his view of "method (tarTq)" in mysticism as compared to philosophy from his numerous statements on the comparative value of revelation and inspiration as against intellectual/mental speculation (nazar, tafakkur). We shall discuss some of them later. Here, it may again suffice to invoke a few verses of his D Twin: The sciences of taste have no method Specified by proofs for the intellects, 23 H.S. Nyberg, Kleinere Schriften des Ibn al-'ArabT, 156f. (Leiden 1919). 24 Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Three Muslim Sages. Avicenna-SuhrawardT-Ibn 'Arabf, 104 (Cam- bridge, Mass., 1964). Cf. also his article "Rabiteh-ye bayn tasawwuf wa-falsafeh dar farhang-e Iran," in Iran Nimeh, 1 (1982), 46-56. For the fallacy inherent in all such labels, see now also Morris, in JAOS, 106 (1986), 544. 25 L. Gardet, "Experience et gnose chez Ibn 'Arabi," in al-Kitdb at-TadhkarT. Muhyl-d-din Ibn 'Arabi, 271 (Cairo 1389/1969). Presentations of the "philosophy" of Ibn 'Arabi will appear in the future as they did in the past, cf., for instance, R. Landau, in The Muslim World, 47 (1957), 46-61, 146-60. 26 See his Fihris, ed. Kurkis 'Awwad, in Revue de l'Academie Arabe de Damas, 29 (1954), 530. 6</page><page sequence="7">Ibn 'Arabi between "Philosophy" and "Mysticism" Except working according to the data of the religious law And holding to a worldly law (ndmuzs) accompanied by acceptance. As well as the concern of a stern and proud speaker of truth Providing better guidance (proof) for a weak being than anything else does.27 As we would expect, Ibn 'Arabi is not particularly given to referring to philosophy and philosophers directly. Yet, his works contain a few statements explicitly mentioning falsafah and faylasiuf. He also occasionally quotes persons and opinions which he himself acknowledged as having formed part of "philosophy." This material will be discussed here. It constitues the most important basis for understanding his attitude toward philosophy and its relation to his mysticism. Arabic scholars nowadays are increasingly engaged in attempts to clarify Ibn 'Arabi's indebtedness to philosophy from his own statements,28 Such efforts, in fact, go back to as early as the sixteenth century. In a crudely systematic fashion, some significant passages were collected and discussed by the learned and prolific ash-Sha'ranl (ca. 1495-1565), principally in his Kitab al- YawdqTt wa-l-jawdhir fi bayan 'aqd'id al-akabir, which served as a stimulus for the incipient study of Ibn 'Arabi in Europe near the end of the nineteenth century. Ash-Sha'rani's quotations of passages from Ibn 'Arabi were not always completely literal. He was concerned with accurately rendering the drift of the passages, and that he did. Moreover, it is most difficult to quote Ibn 'Arab! literally and at the same time with the required economy, since his torrent of consciousness flows so wildly that it cannot easily be dammed up into quotable segments. A small example of how reliance upon an ash- Sha'rani quotation could give a seriously misleading impression occurs in one of his lesser treatises, in which he defends Ibn 'Arabi against the accusation of sharing the heretical belief of philosophers in the eternity (qidam) of the world.29 Introducing one of his proof texts as coming from chapter 293 of the Futiuht, he speaks of the "God-forsaken philosophers (al-faldsifah khadhala- hum Allah)" as if Ibn 'Arabi himself had used the phrase. He did not, and as a matter of fact is quite unlikely to have used strong curses directed against the philosophers, even where he disapproved of their views. 27 Diwdn, 78. For the meaning of ndmtus, cf. the text quoted below, pp. 25f. and n. 134. The "speaker of truth" in the third verse is no doubt meant by Ibn 'Arabi to be himself. 28 Cf., for instance, Mahmud Qasim, Mawqif Ibn 'Arab[ min al-'aql wa-l-ma'rifah as-Sufiyah, 15f. (Jdmi'at Ummdurmdn al-IsldmTyah, Mu.hidardt al-mawsim ath-thaqdfi ath-thalith li-l-'am al-jami'T 1968-69), or the slightly more detailed study by Muhammad Ghalldb, "al-Ma'rifah 'ind Muhyi-d-dmn Ibn 'ArabL," in al-Kitdb at-Tadhkdrf (above, n. 25), 181-206. 29 Cf. ash-Sha'ranl, al-Qawl al-mubmn fi r-radd 'aid MuhyF-d-dTn, Ms. Yale L-266 (Catalogue Nemoy, no. 1161), fol. 12a. The other subject treated in the work is a defense of Ibn 'Arabi against the accusation of belief in hulul. See again below, n. 70. 7</page><page sequence="8">Franz Rosenthal Among the passages in which Ibn 'Arabi speaks explicitly about philosophy and how it compares to mystical concerns is one in the Kitdb al-Isfdr 'an natd'ij al-asfdr. There he divides the "travelers," that is, individuals engaged in the search for metaphysical knowledge, into two groups. He characterizes the one group as those "traveling in God with their thoughts (afkdr) and intellects. They inevitably stray from the road, because they think that the only guide they can accept to guide them is their own thinking. They are the philosophers and those who follow a corresponding course. The other group of those engaged in travel are the messengers and prophets and chosen saints, such as the truly insightful (muhaqqiqun) Sufis like Sahl at-Tustari, Abu Yazid al-Bistami, Farqad as-Sabakhi,30 al-Junayd, and al-Hasan al-Basri as well as other famous men of this kind down to our own time."31 (This statement is followed by an interesting explanation of why mystic revelation is more frequent and quicker in recent times than it had been in the old days.) In the Futuhdt where Ibn 'Arabi refers back to the passage of the Isfdr, the express reference to the philosophers is not repeated. The distinction between the two types of travelers is described as one between "those who travel by means of thought in the intelligibilia and the experiences (i'tibdrat), and those who travel by means of actions, the hard laborers."32 It is basically the same thing. The distinction made here is fundamental for Ibn 'Arabi's attitude and stated by him many times. "The philosophers" are on one side, and "those who follow a corresponding course," meaning the Mu'tazilites and Mutakalli- mun in general, are on the other. He concedes that there are also some Sufis like them who use reasoning with respect to metaphysical matters. At the end, they are totally unsuccessful in their search for gnosis and the knowledge of God. Different from the mentioned groups are all truly spiritual seekers, including the most elevated elite among human beings. By direct, divinely given revelation and inspiration, they achieve the only true understanding of God and the world. Ibn 'Arabi describes the purpose of the Futuhdt as "not being concerned with the results of proofs derived from thought, but having as its subject the results of divine revelation (kashf)."33 Or, put somewhat differently: "We are not those who would report any statements of the sages (hukamda)34 or the 30 For Farqad, cf. as-Sam'ani, Ansdb, VII, 55 f. (Hyderabad 1962-82, under as-Sabakhi). He alone among the famous Siifis mentioned here is not listed in all the common reference works. 31 Kitdb al-Isfdr, 7 f. (Hyderabad 1948). 32 Fut., II, 382, 11. 24f. (ch. 190). "Hard laborers" translates ashlb al-yaamalat (not taammu- ldt!) "sturdy, hard working camels." The difference between them and those exalted personalities mentioned in the Kitdb al-Isfdr is presumably that the former constitute the more general run of Sufis as against the special muhaqqiqun. 33 Fut., II, 389,11. 6f. (ch. 196). 34 On the sages, cf. below, pp. 14f. 8</page><page sequence="9">Ibn 'Arabi between "Philosophy" and "Mysticism" statements of others (like them). In our book (the Futuhdt) as well as all our other books, we set down only the results of revelation and dictates of the Truth."35 "Our book," he says elsewhere, "is not meant to present relation- ships established by speculative thought, but its subject is the inspirational, revelatory sciences (al-'ulum al-wahblyah al-kashfiyah)."36 The well-known intellectual proofs have no place in the Futuhdt. "The work is built upon the religious law and upon the results of revelation and direct witness (shuhud)," something that reason is unable to attain.37 Note here again the inclusion of the religious law. It remains of fundamental importance for Ibn 'Arab! in all his thought. There are numerous similar expressions of the same idea. Repeti- tious as they may appear on the surface, they always exhibit some individual features depending mainly on the context in which they occur. Thinking (f-k-r) constitutes a "veil." 38 Yet, Ibn 'Arabi is keenly aware of its great importance, even though it is a human, not a divine, attribute. Its role is indicated by the many positive references to it in the Qur'an: Thinking is a state, of which I am not unaware, For God has established it(s position) in verses and siirahs. Thought is a natural epithet (na't). It has Control only over human beings.39 A recurrent theme in Ibn 'Arabi's work is the many limitations imposed upon thought. The power of thought (al-quwah al-mufakkirah) does not suffice to achieve a perception of the essence of God.40 However, Ibn 'Arab! also constantly stresses the theme that thinking has its definite uses, provided that thought and inferential reasoning (istidldl) are sound and that the thinkers (nuzzar) are not led to doubts by proofs which seem to be proofs but, in fact, are not.41 The intellect is an instrument given by God to man. He has placed it in man's rational soul for moral purposes, and it should therefore always be 35 Fut., II, 432, 11. 8 f. (ch. 198,fasl 14). 36 Fut., II, 355, 11. 5 f.

Cf. also Kitdb at-Tardjim, 12 (Hyderabad 1948): "The veils preventing the perception of the knowledge of the Truth are great, the greatest among them being knowledge... Heraclius (the Byzantine Emperor) possessed knowledge of Prophecy but had no belief, so his knowledge was of no use to him. The Jews knew that Muhammad was truly the Messenger of God... Cf. also Kitab at-TarEjim, 57. A very different situation is presupposed in the description of "knowledge" as a veil in Mawaqi' an-nujam (see below, n. 184).

But it is a veil that veils the hearts (and thus protects them) from ignorance. 39 Fut., II, 229 f. (ch. 144 beg.).

Revelation has a clearcut advantage over it: O my people! The results of the sciences of revelation (kashf) Enjoy superiority over the science of the hearts. For the intellect cannot roam In the arena of witnessings and absences. How many mistakes and shortfalls are there in thinking! But how much correct insight (nazar) does the discerning eye have! Were it not for the eye, no clear guide would Show itself to the intellect in a man of heart.44 Ibn 'Arab! sees the clearest proof of that superiority in the disagreement that he is convinced is endemic among philosophers and their ilk. He attempts to explain the origin of their different views in these terms: "... the sciences of the intellect derived from thinking contain an element of changeability, because they follow the temper (mizdj) of the thinking and intelligent indivi- dual. He considers only sensible matters which may have existence in his imagination and accordingly are his evidence. The result is that theories (maqalah) with respect to one and the same thing differ or one and the same investigator (nazir) differs with respect to the same thing at different times, because of differences in temper and mixture and combinations in their development (nash'ah). Thus their statements differ with respect to one and the same thing and with respect to the basic principles upon which they construct their details. In contrast, the directly inspired and legislative knowledge possesses one and the same taste (tain), even if the perceptions of this taste (matd'im) differ ..."45 In other words, the mystical experience called "taste" provides unchanging basic principles of metaphysical knowledge, whereas the intellectual quest for metaphysical knowledge-whose existence is understandable because the intellect is a divine gift in man, which, however, can go only a limited distance based as it is on physical means of cognition-is led astray by its concern with widely changeable details and a neglect of the basic principles. 42 Fut., II, 319, 11. 13f.

But then, at some other time, or when a member of another group-be it a Mu'tazilite, Ash'arite, Brahman, or philosopher-comes up with something to contradict or impugn the earlier proof which they had fully accepted, their first (view) is seen as erroneous and not thoroughly proved ..."46 Scholars who enjoy direct revelation (kashf) find divine guidance through the Qur'an (furqdn). This makes them aware of all the differences and the amount of truth and untruth in the intellectual speculation about God. Thus, through direct inspiration, they are able to worship God both as commanded by Islam and essentially. However, "the speculative scholars ('ulama' an-nazar) are distributed over many different groups. Each of them has its own idea about God according to the results obtained from speculating on their particular evidence concerning the knowledge of God. Thus their doctrines concerning God differ greatly."47 Yet, no matter how much they differ from each other, they do maintain coherence within their particular group. The Ash'arite argument about knowledge of God's essence is true, but it's truth is doubted by the Mu'tazilah, and vice versa. Inspite of it, although their leading scholars have differences, they retain their respective identities as either Ash'arites or Mu'tazilites. "Likewise," Ibn 'Arabi continues, "the philosophers do not cease to differ in their doctrines about God and their necessary beliefs. Still, each group is united by one and the same position and by one and the same denomination. They differ with respect to the basic principles of their common school (madhhab), giving no considerations to the details." On the other hand, the prophets and comparable exalted human beings as well as all those individuals who possess revelation (kashf) have never been observed to differ with respect to the basic principles, and they never had doubts about the belief in God.48 In short, "the way of kashf and shuhid bears no discus- sion."49 That of philosophy cannot do without it. According to Ibn 'Arabi's firm conviction, there could be only one truth about the divine. He would have considered it absurd to concede, as modern historians of religion are inclined to do, that direct experience of the divine could lead to differing opinions and beliefs. But if Ibn 'Arabi was convinced of the unassailability of his position, why then, we may ask, did he bother with the views of philosophers and other wrongheaded thinkers? The obvious answer, which also applies to the entire revelation-versus-reason debate, is that 46 Fut., II, 645, 11. 8 f. (ch. 289). 47 Fut., III, 402, 11. 4 f.

Ibn 'Arabi's own answer is contained in a remarkable passage from the long introduction of the Futu.hdt. Exhorting the student who is concerned with the knowledge that conforms to the Prophetical knowledge inherited from the prophets, the true metaphysical knowledge, he tells him: "Don't let yourself be turned off, when you come across a problem that was mentioned by a philosopher or a Mutakallim or a speculative scholar in any discipline of knowledge, to such an extent that you would say about the person who mentions it and who is a truly insightful (muhaqqiq) Sufi that he is a philosopher, just because the philosopher (al-faylasJf)50 mentioned that very problem and discussed and believed it. (And don't say) that (the Sufi who discusses it) derived it from (the philosophers), or that he has no religion, because the philosopher who had no religion (and was no Muslim) stated it (earlier). Don't do that, friend! It would be an inconsequential argument. For not all the philosopher's knowledge is untrue, and that particular problem may just involve some truth he possesses. This is particularly so when it concerns the wise sayings (hikam) and moral uprightness 5 which (the philosophers) have written about. We must set down the philosopher's statement with respect to that specific problem and acknowledge it to be true. For the Prophet, or a companion (of the Prophet), or Malik, or ash-Shafi'i, or Sufyan ath-Thawri has (also) stated it. If you (attack a truly insightful Sufi by) saying that he heard it from the philosopher (in oral instruction) or read it in the books of the philosophers, it could be you lie and show ignorance. The lie would be your saying "he heard or read it," since you did not observe that directly. The ignorance would be your failing to make a distinction between truth and untruth with regard to that problem. Your statement that the philosopher has no religion does not mean that everything he possesses (in the way of knowledge) is untrue. Every intelligent person would perceive that right away."52 All the elements of Ibn 'Arabi's attitude toward philosophy are to be found here. The intellect has its proper, if limited, role to play. Ethics as taught by the philosophers is by and large not objectionable. Metaphysics as expounded by the philosophers and the speculative theologians-Ibn 'Arabi frequently refers to the Ash'arites by name, not quite as frequently to the Mu'tazilites, with often little clearcut distinction between the two and the Ash'arites being 50 With the definite article. The reference may be to Aristotle, but this is not a necessary assumption. 51 Lit., "freedom from desires and psychological trickiness (maka'id)." 52 Fut. Y, I, 145f. See now E.

Religion, which means Islam, even if religion in this passage is used without the definite article, provides the true and binding guidelines for everything. The undeniable fact that the philosophers lived before the coming of Islam and thus were not Muslims does not disqualify them per se; however, where their views cannot be reconciled with those of Islam, they cannot be accepted as true. It all adds up to a noteworthy display of broadmindedness, if not tolerance.54 Tolerance is quite uncharacteristic of the monotheistic mystic. Ibn 'Arabi was a staunch, even fanatic, supporter of Muslim beliefs, traditions, and practices. Here, however, we find him professing the need for a kind of intellectual objectivity which reflects the long tradition of philosophy in Islam. It appears to agree well with Ibn 'Arabi's personality as a determinedly independent thinker, hardly a "liberal," but a dedicated intellectual. The question raised by the quoted passage whether "the philosopher" could refer to Aristotle requires a brief discussion of Ibn 'Arabi's view of the relationship of hikmah "wisdom" and hakim "sage" to philosophy.55 In his mind, words such as fikr or nazar evoked all sorts of human, non-inspired endeavor; they preferably concern Kalam rather than philosophy, although the potential distinction is not always clearcut. Hikmah and hakim, words firmly grounded in the Qur'an, were expectedly very much used by him, and in different connotations. They also served him, of course, as quasi-synonyms of falsafah and faylasif. To him, too, hikmah basically signals a higher form of knowing. The difference intended between "wisdom" and "knowledge" is hard to pin down at times in his view of the world. For instance, the divine apparition encountered by him at the Ka'bah tells him: "I am the knowledge (al-'ilm), the known (al-ma'lum), and the knower (al-'alim)-I am al-hikmah, al-muhkam, and al-haktm."56 53 For a positive evaluation of a contemporary Mutakallim/Ash'arite, cf. Fut., IV, 22, 11. 12 ff. (ch. 416). For the purported weaning of a contemporary Mu'tazilite from his theory of the creation of human actions, cf. Fut., II, 182, 11. 2ff. (ch. 98); IV, 179, 11. 12ff. (ch. 534). 54 On the strength of the passages quoted here, which he knew through ash-Sha'rani, Nyberg concluded that Ibn 'Arabi had nothing against philosophers and Mu'tazilites whenever they offered some truth, cf. Kleinere Schriften, 21, n. 3. 55 'Uqala' is occasionally used by Ibn 'Arabi with reference to faldsifah but is of little importance in his work. See Fut., II, 619, 1. 8 (ch. 282): al-'uqald'min al-faldsifah. Cf. also below, p. 26. For "hukamd' of the falasifah," see below, n. 65. Qudamd' "ancients" is also not absent, see, for instance, above, p. 3, 1. 10. The 'Uqlat al- mustawfiz (in Nyberg, Kleinere Schriften, 76) refers to "the ancient philosophers (al-qudamd' al- faldsifah)," but, according to the critical apparatus of the edition, al-faldsifah is missing from one manuscript, and only qudamd' appears in the continuation of the passage. 56 Fut. Y, I, 219,1. 6 (ch. 1). Cf. also below, n. 80. Hukamd' appears in one manuscript as a variant reading for faldsifah in Fut. Y, III, 219, 1. 3 (ch. 28). 13</page><page sequence="14">Franz Rosenthal Hikmah is defined by Ibn 'Arabi as God's system of ordering the world and everything in it. Hikmah in this sense, however, is also applicable to human sages and may well be compared to philosophy. With a number of slight variations, Ibn 'Arabi repeats this definition over and over again. The dividing line between divine and human hikmah appears blurred, if not non-existent, in many passages of his writings, and is so also in reality as conceived by him.57 The common equation of hikmah with falsafah, and hakim with faylasuf, is also very much alive in his works. Once he expressly states that by hukama' he meant the faldsifah.58 In his at-TadbTrdt al-ildhiyah, he refers to al-hakTm as the author of the Secretum Secretorum; in his Fihris, he supplies the name of Aristotle.59 Hakim stands indubitably for philosopher wherever Ibn 'Arabi uses the word in connection with the sciences (even at times including metaphysics): "In relation to what we have mentioned," he informs us, "there is much difference between speculative sages (hukamd) who do not belong to our way (tariq). For the Mutakallim qua Mutakallim has nothing to do with the science of (physics). This is in contrast to the hakTm. This word stands for the combination of metaphysics, physics, propaedeutics (riyddt), and logic, and there are only those four orders of sciences."60 All of them, of course, belong to what was taken to be "philosophy." In fact, Ibn 'Arabi acknowledged that "most of the speculative sciences and practical61 crafts were invented by the souls of sages with pure and strong minds and thoughts, although, needless to say, real wisdom (haqiqat al-hikmah) comes as a gift of God from supernatural forces (al-'ilm al-ladunnt).62 Still, it must always be kept in mind that ordinarily, Ibn 'Araby reserved hikmah/hakTm for a higher order of consciousness.

Kitdb al-Fana' wa-l-mushdhadah, 8, 1. 2. In general, scholars were few, and ignorance of what matters really meant was prevalent, cf. Fut., II, 185, 1. 3 (ch. 101)-a complaint commonly heard.

It is characteristic of Ibn 'Arabi's cautious approach to the equation of hikmah with falsafah. He felt that such caution was necessary in order to avoid giving the wrong impression that he was identi- fying with objectionable metaphysical views found in philosophy. This becomes clear in another famous and much quoted passage from the Futuihdt-to my knowledge the only one in the entire work in which a Greek philosopher is cited by name.66 Ibn 'Arabi's discussion here starts from the usual assumption that both thinking (fikr) and taste (dhawq) have their definite place in the process of gaining experience (i'tibdr). The people of the path of God accept this to be so. It is denied only by scholars whose exclusive concern is with material phenomena (designated as ahl ar-rusum) and who use specula- tion and inferential reasoning but have no taste of mystical states. "It is rare," Ibn 'Arabi continues, "that one of them does have a taste of mystical states. Among the sages (hukama'), one of those was the divine (ildhT) Plato. His psychological disposition is found to be the same as that associated with the people of revelation and existence (kashf/wujfud). Some Muslims dislike him. They do so only because they connect him with falsafah. Their attitude is caused by ignorance of the meaning of the word falsafah. The hukamd' are in truth the knowers of God and of everything ... Hikmah is the knowledge of prophethood. Faylasif means 'lover of wisdom' because sophia in Greek is wisdom or, according to another opinion (!), 'love.'67 Thus falsafah means 'love of wisdom.' Every intelligent individual loves wisdom. However, people who think, whether they are philosophers, Mu'tazilites, Ash'arites, or any other kind of thinker, are wrong'with respect to metaphysical questions more often than they are right. The philosophers were assumed to be deserving of 63 See above, n. 2. 64 Cf. also Fut., III, 234, 1. 12 (ch. 352). 65 Fut., III, 37,11. 7 f.

In the last passage, however, Ibn 'Arabi distances himself from the "philosopher sages" and their view on the origin of the world. 66 The only other Greek name mentioned in the Futuhdt is Galen, cf. Fut., III, 113, 1. 6 (ch. 330). 67 Ibn 'Arabi was interested in language and traveled in countries of many different tongues. On three occasions, he mentions the word for "God" in various languages: Fut., II, 360, 11. 9-11 (ch. 178); II, 683, 11. 29-31 (ch. 297); and III, 300, 11. 17f. (ch. 361), and he even refers to several words for "horse," apparently in at-Tanazzuldt al-Mawsiliyah. See Asin Palacios, "El mistico Murciano," in Boletin (above, n. 16), 88 (1926), 583 f. However, the remark on the etymology of "philosopher" is strictly traditional. It stands to reason that wa-qlla is a distortion of isa-fTl(i) "and phil(e)." 15</page><page sequence="16">Franz Rosenthal blame just because of their designation as philosophers. Their mistakes with respect to matters metaphysical were responsible for their contradicting revela- tions received by the messengers, since in their thinking, they applied the wrong ideas concerning the basic principle and correct significance of prophecy and messengership and thereby became confused. Had they, upon falling in love with wisdom, sought it from God, and not by means of thinking, they would have been right throughout. Muslim thinkers other than the philoso- phers, such as the Mu'tazilites and Ash'arites, lived after the coming of Islam. By then, Islam had gained control over them, and they now started to defend it in accordance with their understanding of it. They are basically right (in their views). They are wrong only in some details of interpretation which, in the light of their thinking and the intellectual evidence they possessed, they applied to certain statements by the Lawgiver about God's truth. Understood literally, those statements seem absurd and not provable by reason. In their view, they therefore constituted unbelief (kufr) ... This, then, is wisdom, and the people of God, such as messengers and saints, are the true sages."68 Again, Ibn 'Arabi displays a certain tolerance of rationalism and philosophy and an understanding for the efforts of those who thought that they could rely on philosophical reasoning. It was not uncommon in Islam to excuse the Greek philosophers-and thus to a certain degree philosophy itself-on account of their having lived before the coming of Islam and consequently having been unable to know the full truth. Ibn 'Arab! definitely accepted this line of defense. He was ready to admit that the philosophers, both ancient and recent, possessed a good deal of true insight, if not the full truth, even in metaphysical questions where even Muslim theologians were apt to misunder- stand and misinterpret the full truth that could easily have been theirs. When Ibn 'Arabi referred to philosophers of his own time, he used no derogatory epithets,69 although he was chagrined by their negative attitude toward his own visionary approach which they did not hesitate to brand as a kind of madness (hawas).70 In one of his poems, he even went so far as to claim that both Aristotle and al-Ash'ari would have agreed with him and that all he did was to rectify their principles and arguments.71 In general, it can be said that he possessed a historical understanding of the importance of philosophy. His attitude toward its representatives may be described as condescendingly 68 Fut., II, 523 (ch. 226). 9 See above, p. 7. 70 Fut., II, 591 bottom (ch. 275). The passage was quoted already by M. Schreiner from ash- Sha'rani, see his "Beitrage zur Geschichte der theologischen Bewegungen im Islam," in ZDMG, 52 (1898), 527, n. 1, reprinted in his Gesammelte Schriften, ed. M. Perlmann, 428, n. 1 (Hildesheim- Ziirich-New York 1983). Ash-Sha'rani expands the quotation at the end with an attack upon the philosophers as being ignorant. 71 Diwan, 466, 11. 17ff. 16</page><page sequence="17">Ibn 'Arabi between "Philosophy" and "Mysticism" compassionate, as was proper for someone who believed that he was divinely chosen and privy to the one true knowledge. This then can be said to have been Ibn 'Arabi's attitude toward philosophy and philosophers as expressed in his own statements. His numerous further references to philosophers, their works, and their views seem to confirm this impression. It comes as no surprise that a work such as the collection of significant sayings, which he published under the title of Muhddarat al-abrdr, is much less reticent with respect to the use of names than the Fut.uhit. The Muhadarah often quotes wise sayings (hikam) and attributes them to such famous names as Hippocrates, Aristotle, his pupil, the great Alexander, and even Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato. Some of these sayings are repeated in the Futiuhdt without attribution.72 It may not be accidental that the celebrated Muslims generally known as philosophers are not mentioned by name even in the Muhddarah. The beginning of the poem on the soul by Ibn Sina is presented simply as belonging to "the poem famous among scholars," with no explicit reference to its authorship.73 Ibn Bajjah, who is known to us principally as a philosopher, is mentioned in the Fututhdt in a story involving him and Ibn Zuhr. The story's only concern is with their respective expertise in botany and pharmacology, but in the telling of it there is a whiff of Ibn Bajjah as a philosopher. Ibn Bajjah supposedly imagined that he knew more about plants than Ibn Zuhr. This, in fact, was not the case. He was better than Ibn Zuhr in physics (al-'ilm at-tabT'7).74 For Ibn 'Arabi, such "physics" was a part of falsafah. On another occasion, he compares the shuyukh, the Sufi masters, who are not lawgivers but the guardians of the religious law as well as the guardians of human hearts and morals, to physicians as contrasted with physicists. The physician knows about "nature" only in as far as it governs the human body, whereas the physicist knows it outright, even if he is not a physician.75 When speaking of al-Batalyawsi, Ibn 'Arabi would hardly have thought of him as a philosopher, although he refers to his only known philosophical work.76 And his contacts with a great contemporary, Fakhr-ad-din ar-Razi, 72 See below, n. 125. 73 Muhadarat al-abrar, I, 362 (Cairo 1972).

Ibn Bajjah's grave in Fes was near that of Ibn 'Arabi's grandfather, see Ibn Abi Usaybi'ah, 'Uyun al-anbd', II, 63, 11. 29 f. (Cairo-K6nigsberg 1882-84). 75 Fut., II, 365, 11. 3-5 (ch. 181).

In his introduction to the edition and translation of the work (in al-Andalus, 5 [1940], cf. Obras Escogidas, II-III, 496 [Madrid 1948]), M. Asin Palacios says that but for the Hada'iq, al-BatalyawsT would be classified as a philologist and in no way as a 17</page><page sequence="18">18 Franz Rosenthal were clearly with ar-Razi as a Mutakallim.77 Ibn Rushd's lasting fame rests upon his philosophical work, but young Ibn 'Arabi's encounters with him were, as far as we know, strictly on the mystical level. Ibn 'Arabi's report on those encounters has the aura of an edifying, as well as tantalizing, mystical anecdote. It is hard to take the report at face value. Ibn 'Arabi may have built upon an actual occurrence but was carried away by his fertile imagination.78 We have no indication that he studied the philosophical works of Ibn Rushd, but it would seem a safe assumption that he had at least some knowledge of them.79 Ibn 'Arabi's actual acquaintance with technical philosophical writings can- not be reliably documented. It is no longer acceptable, as it was in the time of M. Schreiner, to refer to the Liber de causis or the Theology of Aristotle and thus intimate that Ibn 'Arabi had read them when he spoke of the Pure Good or the identity of knowledge, the knower, and the known.80 All this was general knowledge in his time shared by all intellectuals. Ibn 'Arabi constantly repeated his view on the three aspects of knowledge. He made practically no use of the term "Pure Good," but it is clear that he was aware of it. It is behind his incidental description of non-existence as pure evil,81 or that of the truth as "pure light" and of the absurd (muhadl) as "pure darkness."82 He may philosopher. He shows, however, considerable philosophical interest also in his commentary on al- Ma'arri (see below, nn. 92 and 170). Cf. now E. Torero, in al-Qantara, 5 (1984), 15-31. 77 Cf. the references in Fut. Y, III, 54 f. (ch. 17), and IV, 118 (ch. 46), as well as the epistle on ethics andfutuwah addressed to ar-Razi (Fut. Y, IV, 55 f. [ch. 22]). See also the discussion on the knowledge of God written for him (Hyderabad 1948), below, n. 98. 78 Fut. Y, II, 372 f. (ch. 15). Recent translations appear in H.

The famous episode is generally referred to in connection with both men, cf., for instance, EP2, s.v. Ibn al-'ArabT as well as s.v. Ibn Rushd. 79 Nyberg, Kleinere Schriften, 24, quoting Ibn 'Arabi's Autobibliography and apparently emending his reading "Ibn Sabil" to "Ibn Rushd," states that Ibn 'Arabi studied Ibn Rushd's juridical works. However, the edition of the Autobibliography by 'Abd-ar-Rahmfn Badawi in al- Andalus, 20 (1955), 116, reads "Ibn Shibl" and makes no connection with Ibn Rushd, inspite of the seemingly close similarity of the forms. Even more strange is the fact that the title of the juridical work mentioned by Nyberg does not agree with the indications in Badawi's edition. The identity of the individual, if it is not Ibn Rushd (or his grandfather?), remains to be established. 80 Cf. M. Schreiner, op. cit. (above, n. 70), 526; Gesammelte Schriften, 427. The references Schreiner had for the Pure Good and for knowledge, etc., were, respectively, Fut., III, 315, 1. 9 (ch. 364), and Fut. Y, II, 82 (ch. 2,fasl 3) [see also above, n. 56].

No such identification of passages from philosophical works such as the Theology or the Liber de causis has, to my knowledge, as yet been made.83 Ibn 'Arabi tells us that he once saw a book with the title al-MadTnah al- fddilah in someone's possession in Marchena. He noticed in it the statement: "We must speculate on how to posit a god in the world," using ilah, and not Allah. Immediately, he returned the book to its owner in disgust, and he never again came across it.84 No such statement is to be found in al-Farabi's Ard' ahl al-madTnah al-fadilah, where "The First" is referred to. Nor, for that matter, does either ilah or Allah occur anywhere in that work (or, it seems, in al-Farabi's political Fusuil). Unless it can be proved that someone else was the author Ibn 'Arabi had in mind, thus eliminating al-FarabT, it might be assumed that he was incensed by al-FarabT's omission of any reference to God, and he distorted this fact in his restless imagination. Had he returned to al-MadTnah al-fddilah later in his life, he might not have been so averse to al- Farabi's work. At any rate, the quoted passage does not tell us much about the extent of Ibn 'Arabi's acquaintance with the available philosophical- political literature. The one "philosophical" work quoted by Ibn 'Arabi is indeed a work on politics. It is the Secretum secretorum, which formed the basis of his at-TadbTrdt al-ildhTyah. He considered it a genuine work of Aristotle addressed to King Alexander.85 More will be said about it below, p. 25. Ibn 'Arabi appears to have regretted later that he interrupted his purely metaphysical pursuits by spending time on the writing of the TadbTrat and occupying himself with man and man's worldly affairs, even though he spiritualized them. He felt that it was wrong for him to neglect the discussion of larger concerns such as the figure of the Mahdi and the Seal of the Saints, and he tried to make up for it in his Kitab 'Anqd' mughrib fi (ma'rifat) khatm al-awliyd' wa- shams al-maghrib.86 The Secretum secretorum, incidentally, also fueled Ibn 83 Exact identifications of possible sources of Ibn 'Arabi are hard to come by. A good example is the discussion of his relationship with Ibn Masarrah by R. Arnaldez, see El2, III, 871 f., s.v. Ibn Masarra. Nyberg's contention that Ibn 'Arabi had the Rasd'il Ikhwdn as-safa' as his direct source for the cosmic scheme of God, the first intellect, etc., plausible as it is, is also hard to prove, see Kleinere Schriften, 145. 84 Fut., III, 178, 1. 11 (ch. 344). For "came across it," another possible but less likely translation would be "studied it." 85 See above, n. 59. 86 This is stated in the introduction of the work. In my translation of Ibn Khaldiin's Muqaddimah, II, 189, n. 960, I doubted, probably incorrectly, the existence of the editions of the work, but they have remained inaccessible to me. 19</page><page sequence="20">Franz Rosenthal 'Arabi's keen interest in other magical subjects such as letter magic and physiognomy; presumably, he did additional reading in monographs on the latter subject.87 Another supposed direct quotation of a philosophical title remains doubtful. We are hampered again by that vagueness generally preferred by Ibn 'Arabi when speaking about philosophy. In the introduction of the Futuhdt, he refers to differences among the physicists, the scholars who defined the building blocks of the world, with respect to a fifth existent (mawjud), the basis and origin (asl) of the four elements (arkdn). This fifth element, he says, was mentioned by al-hakrm ff l-ustuqussdt.88 The preposition fT here is ambiguous. According to Asin Palacios, it introduced the title of a book.89 In the context, this is possible, for Ibn 'Arabi goes on to explain that he learned about the matter from a medical student who read "it" (the book?) to him and asked him to comment on it from his specific mystical revelatory (kashf) point of view. The theory of the existence of a fifth soma or fifth ousia90 was commonly ascribed to Aristotle, who himself never mentions it explicitly,91 and no Aristotelian peri stoicheion could have been intended here (unless, in sheer desperation, we assume the meaning of "letters" for stoicheia and assume that Ibn 'Arabi had in mind Kitdb al-Huruf "Book of letters" as the Arabic title of the Metaphysics, an assumption that would not be much to his credit). In the Muslim world, the fifth element was usually referred to as the fifth nature (tabFlah).92 The differences of the philosophers with respect to the number and the kind and hierarchy of the elements were known and recognized as being of ancient origin.93 Since Ibn 'Arabi's informant was a student of medicine, one might think of a physician who wrote a Kitdb al-Ustuqussit, and the name of Ishaq b. Sulayman al-Isra'ili (Isaac Judaeus) comes to mind, but at least what is preserved and known of his work happens to disregard the theory of the fifth nature.94 All in all, it appears to be more likely that the 87 Cf. the discussion offirdsah in Fut., II, 235-41 (ch. 148). 88 Fut.

It should be noted that Ibn 'Arabi showed himself surprised at learning something that was no doubt general knowledge in his environment, and he must have been aware of its familiarity and triviality; his surprise might have been feigned and prompted by his tendency to dramatize. Later on in the Futiauht, Ibn 'Arabi returns to the concept of the fifth nature. He now considers it self-evident and does not attribute it to anyone in particular: "We would not have known at all that there is the nature of the spheres which is a fifth nature, had we no previous knowledge of the five mothers. When we noticed that the spheres outside (?) these natures were subject to rules (hukm) not inherent in these mothers, we realized the existence of a fifth nature from the atmospheric ('ulwlyah) motion that is in the ether, as well as the terrestrial (suflTyah) motion that is in the water and the soil."95 He again returned to the subject of the four elements (arkdn) of the physical world in a passage in which he distinguishes between six different theories held by various schools. He maintains that in his opinion ('indana), the correct view is that of a fifth basic principles (asl) to be called "nature (abT'ah)" forming the basis of the four elements (arkin).96 It is not clear whether Ibn 'Arabi's information came from the same source in all these passages. However this may be, it seems most unlikely that he had in mind a specific philosophical work we could lay our hands on. The situation is not much different with respect to all of Ibn 'Arabl's statements on philosophical topics. All the accepted parts of philosophy were alive in his educational background. It was almost inevitable for him to touch on them.97 The ambiguity of his attitude with regard to them as well as other fields of worldly learning is well expressed in the epistle which he addressed to Fakhr-ad-din ar-Razi: "The intelligent individual must study all those sciences that serve to perfect his essence and move along with him wherever he goes. The only science (that serves perfection and moves along with him) is the philosophischen Lehren des Isaak Ben Salomon Israeli (Miinster 1911.

For instance, medicine is needed only in the world of sickness or disease. When you move on to a world in which there is no sickness or disease, whom could you cure with medical knowledge? The intelligent individual should make no effort to learn about it (?), even if he were to obtain it by way of a (divine) gift as the medicine of the prophets (was obtained by them as a divine gift). The same applies to geometry (handasah). It is needed in the world of measurement. When you move on, you leave it in its world, and the soul continues on unburdened with anything. The same applies to the occupation with every science which the soul leaves when it moves on to the world beyond. Therefore, an intelligent individual must not seize any knowledge except what is absolutely needed. Rather, he must make an effort to achieve what moves on with him when he moves on. This, in particular, is two sciences, the knowledge of God and the knowledge of the homesteads (mawdtin) of the other world."98 The sages, he adds elsewhere, were ignorant of the sciences he himself had brought.99 The philosophical canon of logic, mathematics, physics, and metaphysics was acknowledged by Ibn 'Arabi, but he viewed all of it as subordinate to metaphysics and considered as bliss only the knowledge of God, and not arithmetic, geometry, or astronomy.100 Technical terms have their special and necessary role to play in every science; Sufism, too, has its special terms.'01 The terminology of a science has to be learned from its seasoned practitioners. This is true for philology,102 grammar, geometry, arithmetic, the mathematical sciences (ta'7llm), Kalam, and philosophy. However, the true novice (al-murld as-sddiq) among the people of God needs no instruction in the technical terminology of his science to begin with. He knows it through direct inspira- tion.'03 Although Ibn 'Arabi's entire work has epistemology at its core, logic and logicians are not often mentioned expressly. It is important for him to stress in so many words that the knowledge of God and the Qur'an, limitless fields of knowledge that they are, "do not follow a logical canon (qdnun mantiqT) and are not governed by a scale (mTzdn)." 04 Everything has a mlzdn, and "the 98 Risalah ila l-imdm ar-Razt, 6 (Hyderabad 1948).

Of the ten there remain only truly realized activity (fi7 muhaqqaq) and a concretely substantial agent (fa'il mu'ayyan) or, in other words, visible activity (fi'l zdhir) in an unknowable agent (fd'il majhul) whose influence (athar) is seen but whose predicate (khabar) is not recognized, whose concrete substance ('ayn) is not known, and whose mode of being (kawn) remains unknown."109 In sum, we may fairly say that Aristotelian logic was unquestionably accepted by Ibn 'Arabi up to the point where his metaphysical presuppositions take over. Ethics was even more firmly acknowledged by Ibn 'Arab! to be an unobjec- tionable part of philosophy.110 Metaphysical concerns do not intrude here to any noteworthy degree, apart from the often stressed fact that proper morals are the hallmark of Sufism.111 In a general way, and often with his customary vagueness, he fully subscribes to theories about parts of the soul inherited from Greek philosophy."2 The rational soul, as, he says, it is called by the sages and for which the Qur'an and the Sufis have different but equivalent 105 Fut., III, 6, 11. 16f.

Favorite topics of practical ethics such as the usefulness of silence appear in the long concluding chapter of the Futihat dedicated to "exhortations in the form of wise sayings (wasayd min manthur al-hikam wa-maysur al-kalim)," ' 7 as, for instance, "Nothing deserves imprisonment more than the tongue."'18 Ibn 'Arabi remembers having heard the four statements on silence ascribed to the four kings of the world, the rulers of, respectively, Persia, India, China, and Byzantium. This happened in Fes when he was in his early thirties. He reports the saying in this form: "Four kings made four statements as if shot from one bow. Kisra said: 'I am better able to reject what I did not say than what I did.' The king of India said: 'When I make a statement, it owns me, although I owned it (before).' Qaysar, the king of the Rum, said: 'I have no regrets about what I did not say, but I had regrets about what I did say.' And the king of China said: 'The consequences of what was said were more severe than regret about what was not said.'"119 Attributions are rare,120 even general ones such as "one of the sages." For the latter, see, for instance, the saying quoted in the Muhadarah: "One of the sages said: 'Don't talk about what you don't know, lest you be considered ignorant of what you do know!'""12 The Platonic "I know that I don't 113 Risalahfi ma'rifat an-nafs wa-r-ruh, ed.

"A sage wrote to Alexander," we read in the chapter on exhortations in the Futuhat, "Know that time affects everything, replaces it, wears it out, and kills what has been done, except for what is firmly anchored in the hearts of men. Therefore depose in their hearts an everlasting love which will preserve for you a good memory, the generosity of your activities, and the nobility of your accomplishments." '24 Political control of others begins with control of oneself, a favorite topic of ethical and political wisdom literature. Plato said: "He who begins with himself and controls himself (sdsahd) achieves control (siydsah) of people," and Aristotle advised the aspiring politician to "improve yourself for your own sake, and people will follow you." 25 Ibn 'Arabi's acquaintance with the Secretum secretorum126 brought him into contact with a fiirstenspiegel possessing all the ingredients necessary to fascinate medieval man. The Secretum mixed realpolitik with science, supersti- tion, and magic. It also elaborated on the theme of man as a microcosm, which embodied a way of looking at the world that was considered a characteristic part of philosophy and firmly believed in by Ibn 'Arabi. In addition to the Secretum, works on political utopias may also have contribu- ted to his imaginative reconstruction of the "true earth (ard al-haqTqah)," an enormous ideal land with a fantastic administrative setup and located between the earth and Paradise but superior even to the latter.127 An important distinction of a political-philosophical character constantly made by Ibn 'Arabi is the one between the divine religious law on the one hand, and what he calls "wisdom politics (siydsah hikmTyah)" and "wisdom laws (nawdmls hikmlyah)" on the other. In his view, the laws of good government were provided by God in two forms: "One of them, called wisdom politics, is implanted by nature in the souls of great men, who then 122 Fut., III, 22, 11. 12f.

(They provided them for) each city, location, and clime according to the requirements of the temper of each region and their (!) natures, because of their knowledge of the gift given by wisdom. Property, lives, families, relations (arhdm), and pedigrees were thus preserved intact. They called them nawdmfs. The word means "reasons for the good," because in customary technical usage, an-ndmius is what brings the good, while al-jdsus "spy" is employed for evil.'28 These are the wisdom laws set down by intelligent individuals ('uqala') under divine inspiration (ilhdm), of which they were not conscious, for the purpose (of establishing and preserving) well- being, order, and a cohesive structure (irtibdt) in places where people had no revealed (munazzal) religious law (shar'). Moreover, these lawgivers had no knowledge of the fact that those matters are something that brings (them and other human beings) near to God. They do not lead to Paradise or Hell nor anything else concerned with the other world. They did not know that there was another world and a sensible (mahsus) resurrection after death in natural bodies... Therefore, their laws (nawamTs) and rules for the public interest (masalih) were based upon a perpetuation of well-being (salah) in this world..." Those men then proceeded to speculate about God and the soul, until a messenger arose among them with a divine revelation concerning all those matters.'29 Secular laws based upon philosophical speculation continued to exist, but for Ibn 'Arab1, they were surpassed and superseded by the divine law. In contrast to the religious law of the prophets which is proven to come from God, the conventional law (an-ndmuis al-wad'T) required by wisdom has no such proof. The Exalted Truth takes it from His name(s) al-bdtin al-haklm130 and places it into the hearts of the sages of the moment (hukamd' al-waqt)131 without their being conscious of it. They add that thrust (?) to their specula- tion, not knowing that it is from God specifically ('aid t-ta yTn), but they see that the basic principle is from God; so they establish it as law for their contemporary followers, since they had a prophet whose prophethood was proven. If they execute on their part the norms of that law (ndmus) and do not transgress but observe it, God rewards them according to their dealings with Him in this world and the other world, as does the established religious law...

It is no secret that it serves the (continued) existence of the public interest with regards to family, property, and goods (?).132 The same is the case as regards the other world, even if the person in charge of (sahib) the wisdom law does not concern himself with it, as is the case with the law (ndmus) of the divine order (al-hukm al-ildhi). In the other world, we have 'what no eye has seen and no ear has heard nor has it occurred to any human being,' 133 and it comes to us with no previous knowledge of it.

What is more, he tolerated the study of it. Being a product of intellectual speculation, it was, however, naturally inferior to the divinely revealed religious law. While sage lawgivers saw in it a prelude to metaphysical understanding, it fell far short of the truth, and understandably so, because the boundaries of the human knowledge of metaphysical truth were clarifiable only by mystical revelation. Ibn 'Arabi subscribed to the basic data of the scientific knowledge of mathematics and medicine which were the general property of the educated of his time. Infrequently as he cites such data, he shows originality only in applying them to his metaphysical preconceptions, at times in a somewhat bizarre manner. His views on physics also depended on scientific assumptions developed on the basis of ancient philosophy. Specific attributions by name to scholars or the sages are again infrequent, nor are the statements reported as starting points for his discussion anything more than vague paraphrases. Numbers speculation, it may be added, is called Pythagorean, as usual.'35 He refers to some medical opinions.

We have already seen how Ibn 'Arab! dealt with the fifth element.'39 He appears to have found an overarching element more appealing to him in the concept of hayild "hyle, primordial matter."140 We cannot be absolutely certain whether he was aware of the Greek provenience of hayiuld; he probably was because of the strange form of the word and its philosophical origins. On the disputed problem of matter and form, he stated that "the sages call (every thing that accepts forms in its essence) hayul." l141 "The universal hayiul accepts every form." 142 It is to be equated with the substance of the "primary habd'," the speck of dust which together with 'amd' "cloud" constitutes the code words for the transitional stage between God and the material worlds in Ibn 'Arabi's mystical terminology.'43 The "hylic substance (al-jawhar al-hayuldnT)," which includes the elements, is the inferior equivalent in nature to the "divine breath (an-nafas al-ildhl)" that has accepted the forms of the universe.'44 Among the beginnings (sadr) peculiar to each thing in the vast interval between God and man, "the beginning of time (zamdn) is the time of the acceptance of form by the hayula."14s Time as well as space and motion have remained fundamental problems of physics ever since Aristotle gave them a prominent place in the discussion. For Ibn 'Arabi, "formal substance, accident, time, and place are the moth~ers of existence." 146 He wrote extensively on time, space, and motion, and, in particular, on time.'47 Time played a much larger role in his thought than space.'48 He came back to time over and over again in his works.

Philosophical conceptions of time intrude even into his discussion of the prayer times 149 and are mentioned in connection with the pilgrimage.150 The difficult notions of past, present, and future engaged him very much, especially, as we would expect, the present moment, the now (waqt), so important in mysticism.'15 It should be under- stood, however, that the mystical moment of illumination does not concern us here, but it is time (zamdn) as a physical phenomenon, although the two cannot always be separated from one another and certainly were not always strictly kept apart in mystical thought. Ibn 'Arabi's definitions of "time" are consistent but vary slightly from case to case. As defined by the hukamd', he says, time "is an imagined duration segmented by the motions of the spheres (muddah mutawahhamah taqta'uha harakdt al-afldk)."152 Using the Aristotelian terminology of counting/number in connection with time he speaks of "time that is numbered by the motions of the spheres."153 The question prominently raised by Aristotle (Physics 216b31) whether time was an existent or non-existent dominates Ibn 'Arabi's reflections. Time has no substantive existence,154 but belongs to the corporeal possibilia.155 It is a relationship, imagined to have existence but non-exis- tent,'56 or a relationship in the mind that has neither existence nor non- existence.'57 One of the Futuhdt's chapters dedicated to "time" starts with 149 Fut.

He who says that time is the connection between two matters by means of "when" (has to be countered by the observation that) time has never ceased accompanying things."

Its influence shows that its power is like nature. Substance from (nature) as well as from it(self) is non-existent in it. Through it, things take on substance, while itself it has no substance that would allow it to determine it(self). The mind is unable to perceive its forms. Therefore we say that time (dahr) is something imagined. But for abstract immateriality (tanazzuh) God would not have named His158 existence for it. It is revered in the heart. If you are fair, (you will recognize that) its origin is from eternity. It is determined as possessing the character of eternity (azalT). Like the void, it is an extension without limit (on either side) in something incorporeal provided with corporeality through imagining.'59 In the Sufi spirit, Ibn 'Arabi succinctly describes time as "the ruler (sultan)," adopting, it seems, an old saying without explaining it.l60 The knowledge of time ('ilm az-zaman) also belongs to the highest type of inspired knowledge (al-ma'arif al-mawhufbah) for the spirituality of night and day.161 Time, he contends, is comparable to eternity (azal) in that it is imaginary and has no existence, just as eternity is a negative description (wasf salbl) and has no existence.161a Time, he states further, "is for what is created (muhdath) what eternity (azal) is for what is uncreated (qadTm)." 162 Time thus is inseparable from metaphysics,'62a and in the view of Ibn 'Arabi, this applies also to all the basic data of physics, since there is no definite boundary between the material world and the metaphysical structure. The views on metaphysical questions ascribed expressly to the philosophers by Ibn 'Arabi are of special interest in our context, since it is here that his attitude toward philosophy most closely interlocks with his mysticism.

A point of agreement was the existence of God to which most philosophers and thinkers subscribed. It was considered generally permissible to raise the question of the existence (hal) of God, but it was considered improper not only by the philosopher-sages165 but also by "the group" to raise the question of His what, how, and why. "The group (at-ta'ifah)" appears to refer here to the Muslim theologians. 66 The philosophers are usually mentioned where Ibn 'Arabi wishes to register disapproval of their views. This is the case where he states that al-faylasuf denies divine knowledge of the particulars in the sensible world.'67 Because of their mental limitations, philosopher and Mu'tazilite alike deny any vision of God,168 and the philosophers are also deniers of (divine) actions.169 A tentative, and immediately retracted, relationship is established by Ibn 'Arabi between his view of the imagined nature (mutakhayyal) of the entire sensible world and the general outlook of the Sophists (as-Sufista'l 'ah). In the context of his interpretation of Qur'an 8:17, he maintains that neither the philosopher (al-faylasuf) nor those who use rational proofs (adillat al-'uqul) believe that, nor do people who cling to external data (ashab az-.zhir). "Only the Sophists come close to this intuitive insight (mashhad). However," Ibn 'Arabi concludes, "the distinction between us and them is that they say that all that has no 163 Fut.

We say that it is reality, thus disagreeing with all the groups but agreeing with God and His Messenger by virtue of intuitive insight given us by Him." 17 Prophecy obviously exists, but it is naturally something that philosophers do not understand. Ibn 'Arabi therefore feels compelled to exhort his readers to "leave aside the rules (ahkdm) of philosophical books."172 In this context, he contrasts the philosophers with the Ash'arites, as he does again in verses which express his own understanding of the reason why the ultimate goal of any true human endeavor, the knowledge of God, cannot be reached through philosophical thought. Indeed, he concludes that the famous Qur'anic word ummr "illiterate" applied to the Prophet indicates the absence and superfluous- ness of thinking: The knowledge through 173 God provides ornate embellishment. The knowledge through thinking leads to doubt (tashbTh) and error. The knowledge through thinking is summary generalization and mistakes. The knowledge through God is verification and specification.174 The knowledge through thinking is abstract labels (a'ladn). The knowledge through God provides states and saintliness (?).175 Don't be led astray by specious statements! For what they prove is ignorance and diversion/causalization (ta'l7).176 The philosopher holds that God can be denied through The result of his causality. That is atheism.'77 170 The common description of the Sophists speaks of them as "those who declare the realities (pl.) false (yubtilun al-haqd'iq)," cf., for instance, Ibn Hazm, al-Fisalfil-milal, I, 8 (Cairo 1317-21); al-Batalyawsi, Sharh, I, 220 f. (above, n. 92). The formulation was no doubt familiar to Ibn 'Arabi. With his customary independence, he changed it slightly. 171 Fut., III, 525, 11. 26-29 (ch. 384). 172 Fut., II, 595, 1. 32 (ch. 276). The reference to "books" is not gratuitous. Ibn 'Arabi claims that his knowledge is based on revelations (tajalliyat) and does not derive from books, see, for instance, Kitdb al-Masa'il, 6 bottom (Hyderabad 1948). He faults scholars concerned with the material world ('ulama' ar-rusum) for habitually deriving their knowledge "from books and orally from men of their own kind," cf. Fut. Y, IV, 267, 11. 9 f. (ch. 54). 173 The preposition bi- in this connection would ordinarily yield the meaning of "knowledge of God," but the context shows that it must be translated as "by means of, (obtained) through." Words conveying a double meaning by making them mean something they would not normally mean abound in these verses. 174 Cf. Fut., III, 456, 1. 7 (ch. 373) [see above, n. 58]: "(The philosophers) do not know specification in generalization (at-tafsll fi l-ijml)." See also above, p. 11. The gnosis of God, however, is generalized (ijmdlTyah) and allows of no specification, cf. Dhakha'ir al-a'laq, 174. 175 TahwTl-tabdTl normally means "change and alteration," but the deviation from normal usage, as indicated in the translation, appears to be intended. 176 Diversion/entertainment and causal explanation would be the normal meanings of ta7Tl, but, as the following verse shows, Ibn 'Arab! wants it to refer to his view of divine causality. Note his playing with the double meaning of 'illah as disease and cause in his chapter on 'illah in Fut., II, 490ff. (ch. 297). 177 God cannot be conceived as cause, as is done by the philosophers, since this would in reality mean a denial of God. A better translation might be "through assuming him to be a cause." 32</page><page sequence="33">Ibn 'Arabi between "Philosophy" and "Mysticism" Al-Ash'ari holds (that God is) a multiple concrete substance. That is knowledge, but it involves anthropomorphism (tamthl1).178 It would be possible to go on and investigate everything Ibn 'Arabi says page by page, line by line, and find that there always is a close connection with ideas "philosophical" in origin. This is so even if nothing is said about philosophy, wisdom, or thinking and even where philosophy, wisdom, and thinking appear to be rejected explicitly or implicitly through competing notions that are contradictory to them. Philosophy, whether in the Muslim or the classical meaning of the term, constitutes the frame of reference for Ibn 'Arabi's view of the world. The religious and historical traditions of Islam, its religious law and jurisprudence were untouchables but they had to be fitted into that frame-rather, the frame had to be cut to fit them. A constant problem for us, and for Ibn 'Arabi himself, had he been worried about it, is separating philosophy as such from philosophy embedded in Kalam. In fact, this cannot be done. An exceptional example is provided by that constantly repeated theme song of the Futuhdt as well as Ibn 'Arabi's works and thought in general: "He who recognizes his soul/himself recognizes his Lord." Ibn 'Arab! cites the statement in its basic form and in quite a few minor variations. C.A. Nallino was of the opinion that it was impossible to ascertain its provenience in the thought of Ibn 'Arabi. It could have come from Neoplato- nism or reached Islam through patristic writings.179 In this case, it can be stated unequivocally that the Church Fathers were responsible for the coining and the ultimate spread of the statement in its Islamic form familiar to Ibn 'Arabi.180 Usually, we cannot be so sure. A comprehensive assessment of Ibn 'Arabi's scintillating personality and thought seems almost impossible. On the basis of the facts assembled in this paper, a few general remarks suggest themselves. Although we have very little God is neither cause nor caused but the creator of the causes (Fut. Y, II, 223, 11. 4 f. [ch. 6]) and the cause (!) of the existence of the world (Fut. Y, IV, 171, 1. 7 [ch. 48]). The theologians may speak of God as the Cause of causes (Fut., III, 212, 1. 2 [ch. 350]). However, essentially He does not accept 'illTyah, cf. Fut. Y, I, 195; Kitab at-Tajalliydt, 31, also Risalah ad yu'awwal ilayh, 13, 1. 1. (Hyderabad 1948). Fusus, 220 (above, n. 144), refers to ashdb al-'illah who make the Truth a cause for the existence of the world. If it is this passage to which T. Izutsu refers, his slightly disparaging remarks about "the philosophers who blindly follow Greek philosophy" do not reflect Ibn 'Arabi's expressed view, see Izutsu, A Comparative Study of the Key Philosophical Concepts in Sufism and Taoism, I, 195 (Minatoku, Tokyo 1966). Cf. also M. Schreiner, (above, n. 70), 525; Gesammelte Schriften, 426, or A.E. Affifi, The Mystical Philosophy of Muhyid Din-Ibnul 'Arabi, 27 f. 178 Fut., II, 644 (ch. 289 beg.). 179 C.A.

Altmann, in his comprehensive study of "The Delphic maxim in Medieval Islam and Judaism," does not specifically deal with Ibn 'Arabi, see Altmann (ed.), Biblical and Other Studies, 196-232 (Cam- bridge, Mass., 1963). 33</page><page sequence="34">Franz Rosenthal in the form of evidence to go on, he may very well have read the works labeled "philosophical" in his environment.1 8 He certainly was acquainted with some of the works of the speculative theologians. He mentions their names rather frequently, if only a selected few among them, but he is also as hesitant to be specific when he refers to their works, as he is in the case of the philoso- phers.182 What is more important, he was acquainted with all the philosophi- cal thought and ways of looking at the world that had merged into Muslim civilization. If he used a bit of everything haphazardly, it was not mindless eclecticism on his part but the natural way to proceed for a thinker steeped in the vast culture that was his heritage. Next to nothing is known about Ibn 'Arabi's early development. It seems likely that he early on acquired his mystical conviction that direct divine "revelation," with whatever Arabic term he might call it, was available to a chosen few. Through such "revelation," and nothing else, man might be able to gain the only worthwhile knowledge, consisting of metaphysical insights and preferably styled the knowledge of God. Ibn 'Arabi became more and more convinced that he was the chosen recipient of such revelation which helped him to collect and set down his thoughts.183 His way of communica- ting his insights to those in this world-which was full of the ignorant and non-comprehending184-was free flowing meditation. It centered, in the first place, on words and phrases of the Qur'an. Then it took for its texts commonly accepted terms and propositions of earlier mystics and other appealing statements current in his cultural background. Finally, his most eccentric and striking procedure was to reflect on words which he chose because they struck his fancy, and to meditate on them with a fervent intensity and constant outpouring of surprising verbal associations which continue to astonish and impress even today's reader. He never compromised, however, with respect to his basic beliefs. Apart from this mystic and largely unsystema- tic bend, he saw the metaphysical world in terms that were ultimately philosophical. The great problems of time, space, and motion occupied him constantly. The metaphysical world was to be seen and understood as philoso- phy saw and understood the physical world-only he would have put it the other way round. The true order of the world resulted from assigning everything its proper station. That was "wisdom," mystical and divine as well as philosophical, with ultimately no distinction between the two.185 Mystical 181 See above, pp. 19ff. 182 Note, in particular, Ibn 'ArabY's incidental observation in Fut. III, 398, 11. 10f. (ch. 369, wasl 18) that responsibility for some information ascribed to al-Baqillani rests upon the transmitter (wa-l-'uhdah 'all an-ndqil). 183 An example, among others, may be found in Mawdqi' an-nujim. In the absence of the printed text, I used the modem manuscript Yale ar. 480, p. 76. 184 P. 29 of the mentioned manuscript of Mawdqi' an-nujim. See also above, nn. 38 and 60. 185 See above, p. 13. 34</page><page sequence="35">Ibn 'Arabi between "Philosophy" and "Mysticism" revelation was thus logically transformed into a long series of "sciences ('ulum),'186 mystical propositions on the one hand, and philosophical and epistemological problems on the other. This breakup of knowledge into innumerable individual pieces, incidentally, constituted a victory for the ancient aphoristical way of thinking over the systematic method of exposition inherent in "philosophy." Ibn 'Arabi exhibits a palpable hesitation with regard to deciding whether "knowledge ('ilm)" or "gnosis (ma'rifah)" and "wisdom (hikmah)" was more important in the scheme of things. In spite of protesta- tions to the contrary on his part, the balance always appears to be in favor of "knowledge." This marks the final stage of a mysticism which, in order to survive in the surrounding intellectual climate, had become wedded to philosophy. By the time of Ibn 'Arabi, that process, which had started early in Islamic history, had been completed. Ibn 'Arabi's great immediate model was al- GhazzalT. As is clear from the overall plan of the Futuhat which starts out with a thorough discussion of the meaning of the principal Muslim ritual obliga- tions, he aspired to replacing al-Ghazzal's revival of Islam with his own renewal of it in a purer, mystical language.187 More determined than al- GhazzalT to accord absolute preeminence to a monomaniac mysticism to which everything had to be subordinated, he succeeded in becoming the hero of an extremist mysticism never really to be surpassed in its kind and effectiveness. Al-GhazzalT remained the guiding light of a more moderate center. This made him eventually a more powerful and influential historical force. Even more than other mystics and intellectuals, Ibn 'Arabi showed himself fond of the combination of contraries for the purpose of drawing attention to his ideas. Knowledge is at the same time ignorance,188 being might be conceived as non-being,189 right guidance implies both bringing near and keeping away,190 freedom is slavery,191 It would seem to be fair to describe him in this manner. The attempt made here to let his own statements speak for themselves and to see him as he might have seen himself leads to his characterization as both broadminded and intolerant, both liberal and conser- vative, both extremely learned and narrowly focused, both extraordinarily original and totally traditional, both a thinker and beyond thinking-in short, both a philosopher and a mystic. 186 Cf., in particular, the long lists of such 'ulum at the end of chapters in the Futuhat, beginning with ch. 293. 187 See also above, n. 17. 188 For instance, Fut., I, 728, 11. 18f.
