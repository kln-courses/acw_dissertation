HARLEY-WALKER NATURAL science enables us, it is supposed, first to know what science properly is. Other sciences-which purport to exhibit a radically divergent type-are either of doubtful authenticity and highly disputable value, or else humbug, which has long since become transparent. If now the humanists are to be compelled to practise science, they will have perforce, nolentes volentes, to take the natural sciences for their model and adopt their methods. Extra ecclesiam nulla salus. Under no circumstances is recognition extended to a distinctive humanistic type of science side by side with the type of natural science. The distinctions between scientific forms and methods of procedure, which are forthcoming, accordingly all turn out to constitute merely variations within natural science itself. This now becomes the chief object for our present investigation. Does there exist an independent form of humanistic science, which does not, as long as it deserves the title, obviously or latently simply mimic natural science, but does in reality deal in problems of its own and proceed on lines of its own ? In this way the main point of view for our criticism of intellectualism is explicitly presented. There are two quite different ways of arriving at the distinction, real or merely imaginary, between natural science and humanistic science, or, as it is now often termed, moral science. Logic, as theory of categories, here points us in one direction, psychology in another. We propose to take up the psychological distinction, after we have first endeavoured to determine the logical or categorical distinction in some few sharp features. 1 Professor of Philosophy at Gothenburg, Member of the Swedish Academy; died 1916.

But the characteristic feature consists scarcely of facts described and arranged, but far rather of the laws, to which the facts, included in their continuous variation, are subordinated. Matters of fact, properties, conditions, and relations we can become thoroughly familiar with, even outside the sciences proper, and with such we establish acquaintance within all sciences, of whatever kind they may be. But research, discovery and formula- tion of laws-behold, that is something which only pure science carries out, and which therefore belongs to it alone, to natural science in the first place. But here we come now to an exceedingly important, indeed a fundamentally decisive point, and that is this: we must be careful to avoid the ugly old slip of confusing laws with causes. When science establishes laws, it does not properly allege any causes at all-quite simply for the reason that they are both entirely different things. Note well, there is no question of an imperceptible and mystic power, which supplies the energy for everything positive, which carries out work, which presses, weighs down, hurls, repels, attracts, and so forth. It is quite clearly understood that ideas of cause and causality, from the point of view of natural science, are merely useful anthropomorphisms and nothing more, while the fact, the law and the formula afford an accurate description for the case in point. Perhaps the problem of natural science can never be stated in a clearer and more concentrated light than by means of the following characterization: this type of science never has to answer-and cannot answer-the question why, but strictly speaking only the question how. All the same-after all the work of the natural sciences, powerful and full of strong incentive to progress as it is, there always remains over a little residuum of wonder, a little unsatisfied curiosity, that makes one want to know just a little more. And this even about nature itself! This little "more" signifies merely all that is included in the question why, in the cause of all those various things that are and happen. Now one may reproach anybody, who pushes his inquiry over the horizon of the natural sciences, with failing to respect the limitations of man's cognitive faculties. Without raising any objections here to the legitimacy of this objection, we must still insist at once definitely, that anyone who is so inquisitive is most certainly not asking any further questions than scientific curiosity compels him to ask. The natural sciences work with law as their highest category. 388</page><page sequence="3">INTELLECTUALISM: VITALIS NORSTROM The humanistic sciences take cause quite seriously, seeing that they do not regard it merely as an economical subsidiary expression with a sort of anthropomorphic and popularizing suggestiveness about it, but actually as the very hammer for driving the nail in. If causality is not to be merely an empty word, but one capable of being endorsed with known and established experience, then we must inevitably accept that reference to ourselves as living and acting entities, which it indubitably implies, and which cannot be overlooked or misinterpreted without a certain obduracy of thought. It is only in man and his will that we encounter the archetype for all causality, it is only in man's inner experience of himself as active that causality, i.e. the relation between cause and effect, admits of being grasped in sheer activity. That inner experience constitutes the ultimate source of cognition for all causal explanations, whatever variety of colouring these may subsequently assume, according to whether we encounter the cause in the guise of an efficient cause alike preceding and leading up to the event, or in that of a purpose, which operates as a goal of attraction for what happens and is accomplished. Let us now proceed to more psychological ways of looking at the matter. Intellectualism, with its bent towards natural science, seeks the centre of reality within the perceptual world of objects or data presented to it, thus decisively in something outside the spirit itself scientifically engaged. For if I do not understand from the outset that consciousness, soul, spirit are as meaningless as a square circle or a piece of wooden iron, should I be simple-minded enough to reckon them among objects-for consciousness, then I have about as much sense as a man running round a tree to catch himself. But there is nothing commoner even at the present day than to attempt this very feat and to believe that one has performed it successfully. More than this. Intellectualism understands truth to be a more or less fine or rough copy of reality, that is a kind of objecti- fying mode of presentation; it matters not whether the object presented have an empirical or a metaphysical origin, whether the presentation seeks to collect and reproduce earthly or heavenly things. The plastic ideas of Plato, Spinoza's substance, Leibniz's concept of God, the Hegelian thought machinery strictly speaking, foot the dance on the same polished boards as atoms and molecules, though they themselves never dream that they are doing so. The psychological criticism of intellectualism advances in two main directions. First and foremost it points straight to a quite different setting for the humanistic type of science from that which the other type represented by physical science implies with its objectifying and copying methods. Further, it produces evidence that natural science itself, when it reaches a sufficient degree of maturity of judgment and self-criticism, breaks through its own 389</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY shell, and definitely in the name of scientific truth claims to pass over to a new way of researching and theorizing. The investigation of life, consciousness, soul, and spirit can never denote the settingup of mirrors round a market-place to take pictures. For spirit wants to know about itself, but spirit is the actual mirror. Now a mirror does not reflect itself. Here no picture is of any use, for a picture always reproduces merely something else. Now the usual way, in which the investigation of spirit has been undertaken, has been first to make spirit into something else, that is to say externalize it, and next to fix the truth about this outward and alien object in the inward picture-just as one does when dealing with anything else. One might just as well try to get hold of the sun in the water as hunt for the original light in the shadows of the world of ideas. What has been overlooked is the crucial difference between moral science, which logically works out the cohesion and unity among judgments of feeling and value, and natural science, which is merely concerned with judgments of perception. In the case of the first the outward fact taken by itself counts for nothing, but only matters in so far as it characterizes or symbolizes life. What is essential in history cannot be presented, that is to say, brought into view, because it is personality and personal existence. Napoleon is not Corsica, in its setting of the France of I790, that was heaving and cracking; he is not something, which I at second, third, or fourth hand smell, taste, see, or hear, but he is the more or less composite feeling which takes possession of me together with and by means of the pictures, which the historians of Napoleon display for me. This feeling is my Napoleon, but I am quite unable to make out why my man should not in essential features also be yours. That is to say I fail to grasp why a certain defined agreement should not subsist even in the sphere of feeling, and so offer a basis for scientific judgments. Starting-points for scientific investigation do subsist even in the life of feeling. No sufficient justification exists for disputing the scientific character of history on the ground that its proper subject-matter, the acting personality, does not reveal itself anywhere on the plane of perception. Even feelings can be generalized and imparted, provided only that appropriate means for doing so are employed. No one will ever be able to say what inward and spiritual element in experience properly exists which does not proceed from feeling as the subject itself. I feel, therefore I am! Compared with this cogito ergo sum denotes something merely secondary. To tie the existence of the ego down to a cogito leads on to an infinite regress of presup- positions, which mirror one another, of which the first is about the second, and the second about the third, and so on; but hereby one 390</page><page sequence="5">INTELLECTUALISM: VITALIS NORSTROM never reaches the subject or ego, for whom the concepts are. To seek to grasp the existence of the ego in thoughts is to operate with the sieve of the Danaids. The ego lies on another plane, that of feeling. What, then, can truth be in the sphere of feeling? Here we must firmly apprehend and never overlook the point, that we are asking for scientific truth, but not for the private truths of Smith and Robinson. Therefore we must lay special stress on objectivity and universality, that is we must put forward a logical demand for what we have to regard as true. Never, I mean, can it enter our heads for a moment to seek to blur the clear, sharp contours of scientific form with the make-believe of our individual likes and dislikes, desires and interests. We shall not allow ourselves to be led away by anything savouring of subjectivism or obscurantism. The problem of truth in the humanistic sciences may be stated as follows: how can anything be established as universally valid in the domain of feeling? With the answer to that question these sciences stand or fall as sciences. How can people think alike on what is right and wrong, beautiful and ugly, on lower and higher ends, better and worse conditions in general, when the immediate pleasure and displeasure of the moment together with arbitrary calculations of utility obviously prove them- selves more apt to separate than to attract and combine ? How can there be universal ethical principles and aesthetic rules, common perceptions in regard to law and religion? How can certainty be imparted in these subjective domains, how can a scientific truth be established ? I know only one way of answering such questions, and it can be stated as follows: through the power of gifted personalities to attract. Therefore the truth of the moral sciences bears the name of power, while that of the physical sciences emerges as a form of presentation or of thought. Here the subject in quest of truth goes back to the innermost ground of its own being, and takes its stand on this ground, whether it may break or hold. It will quake and break, if it be never more than purely and simply individual; it will hold, if from out of it there spring forth values that can serve as ideals to attract nations, generations, and ages, i.e. values capable of function as criteria of progress along different lines of advance in spiritual and vital movement, so that within reasonable limits people may really be united as to their objective and as to the way of attaining it. This holds good of both morality, law, and religion. It holds good also, and just as much, for aesthetic and history. No evolutionary biology and no physiological psychology will ever get a firm hold on the moral life, for here the point is first and foremost without demur to discover and elucidate a quality in one's own personal 39I</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY life. But this quality can only become the object for scientific treat- ment when an ethical genius interprets his own inner experience, and that interpretation in virtue of elective affinity comes to be recognized as normative and decisive for a number of others. Then we get the external support and identity of content, which are indispensable for all science. It is the demand of ethics, that individual moral values shall be recognized as norms by others as well. Otherwise it remains mere mysticism and never attains the status of a science. The title of historian of one type or another belongs to him and to him alone who discerns development in the form either of progress or of retrogression in an absolute sense. But anyone who sticks fast in the pathless morass of relativity does not really deserve to be called one; for in the last resort he has nothing more important to teach us than that Gustav Adolf's horse, for instance, in the battle of Leipzig went lame in its left hind leg, or that Rousseau's house- keeper was called Therese Levasseur and could not read print. As pure facts ultimately both are equally "scientific," for both alike are equally facts. But we really expect more of a historian than a variegated surface. We want a perspective; and we only get that from the ideal, which defines the end in view. If people refuse for every ideal admission to their "exact" science, then we must console ourselves with the reflection that our despised illusions still remain, when all has been said and done, as milestones on the way to a truth, without which the majority of the patent truths of empirical science, guaranteed to run for ten to fifteen years, might just as well be lies, as far as we are concerned. Already the existence of a fully developed, undeniable, and irre- fragable type of science differing in kind from physical science, including mathematics, refutes and demolishes the narrow limitations of intellectualism. The inward experience of the living spirit, its acts of self-observation, its certainty of the meaning of its own life, are able, in the case of a personality of genius, to rise up in the full light of consciousness and subsequently to be rounded off into a logical and scientific system; but in this system objectification, and therewith the configuration of the forms of actuality presented as it were to consciousness, only play the part of a symbolism, which embodies. According to my view, then, Anti-Intellectualism ought to direct its criticism so as to take account of the dualism within the concept of truth, with which the consciousness of physical science itself operates. There is no longer need to go on criticizing, so to speak, from without: criticism ought instead to enter in to what is being criticized. This amounts to taking note of the essential development, which the consciousness of physical science at the same time has 392</page><page sequence="7">INTELLECTUALISM: VITALIS NORSTROM in fact undergone and had of necessity logically to undergo. This development has regard to the very significance of that truth, the attainment of which is involved in the collected results of all science. Here accordingly the question is not of particular subject-matter or superficial formal distinctions, but of the actual nature of the problem, of what in the last resort it implies to ask and answer questions in science, of the means and possibility of advancing in it and attaining a result. No criticism can penetrate deeper than this in its attitude. We are coming to perceive with increasing clearness that reality is one thing and scientific truth another. We are coming to under- stand that there is still a good and intelligible sense in letting the visible heavenly bodies be what they actually are, in confining space to what we perceive, in saying that grass is green in itself, and snow white, and so on repeatedly. We are coming, in other words, to have confidence in ourselves and believe once more in the old familiar objects, which our normal sense-perception, without asking permission from science, presents to us. What has been called "the world of the man in the street," that narrow little contemptible world, is beginning to come back into fashion, beginning likewise to be appreci- ated again, after having long been ousted by the ideal constructions which astronomers, mechanicians, physicists, chemists, physiologists, and other men of science have put in its place. We are beginning to get over our terror at the gloomy monstrosity of infinity and the endless senseless dance of the atoms, which recently posed as scientifically verified reality, in whatever direction we turned our gaze, and to go back to immediacy without blushing for shame at being old fogies. I have no time to expatiate here with regard to the critical way of understanding truth in natural science-beyond what I have said already. I will just emphasize the point, that it is based on culture and cultural advance, but not on any imaginary copying of reality. What advances culture is true, all else is false. Long ago Goethe expressed the opinion: "Was fruchtbar ist, allein ist wahr." And he was right. To take this line is to bring scientific truth in general under the heading of work, and to make physical science itself approximate to life, the interests of which it essentially serves. It follows, that is to say, that it is only in relation to the purposes of life that talk about truth can have any relevance. Truth is not like a stone, that we can pick up from the ground, but it is a stamp, that we affix to our culture products, far more accordingly a thing that is made than a thing that is found. But along these lines it becomes also manifest how the innermost motive powers in the natural sciences, when they have later emerged into real transparence, carry them up beyond their own level and on into that of the cultural 393</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY and moral sciences. So there exists an immanent dialectic in the thought of physical science, a progressive self-criticism, which elicits the recognition of the principle, that the proper meaning of truth resides in the life of culture, but not in any sort of dead self-contained nature, which can be cut and dried once for all, and that the sciences dealing with this life consequently give the highest expression to all scientific truth. I charge intellectualism with committing two deadly sins. The first is that it inevitably leads to dogmatism, the second is that it sets itself up as a barrier to our spiritual freedom generally. Both these two sins spring from the same root. Intellectualism ties down our thought to a reality in the form of an object for investigation, which is to be essentially independent of our way of thinking. Intelligence can push that object nearer and nearer towards life, walk round it, and contemplate it from various sides, and so make clear the greater or less degree of thorough- ness in our apprehension, which naturally varies considerably with different people and at different times. But the assumption is that the reality in question remains there stationary, as it were, right up in the midst of all that moves around, a fixed goal, to which one can approximate. On this given reality, then, the qualities of which are accurately determinable, intelligence is held to be itself in absolute dependence. It approximates to it more and more in proportion as it rightly and truly acquires for itself the image of the reality. On this assumption the aim set before intelligence in all its efforts is fixed once for all, whether it be matter or force or energy or figure or number or objective idea or thought or absolute substance or anything else, that we later like to consider as forming the essence of this reality. The problem for intelligence is then supposed to be how to grasp reality in its unchangeable qualities, in a word to describe it, whether it be in the terms of physical science or in those of mathematics or in those of metaphysics. People fondly imagine that reality lies still and awaits the convenience of the investigator for him to come back and examine it once more. But reality is badly behaved. It will not stop as it is, but is perpetually renewing itself, as time and life go on. Anyone wanting to come again later will never recognize precisely the same object. It is for ever slipping out of the grasp of investigation and giving rise to endless new problems. It is not true that "there is nothing new under the sun." All that comes into existence is new, and just for the very reason that anything once was so, it never becomes so any more. So when intelligence cannot avoid directing its attention upon itself and its own activity, the consequence of the universal bias of the scientific point of view is that in order to know anything about itself, it must objectify itself 394</page><page sequence="9">INTELLUCTUALISM: VITALIS NORSTROM to a coarser or finer lump to be dissected and described. This is how there arise such objects for investigation as soul, spirit, free will, etc., more or less substantiated and arranged in real chains of association. But that is to commit the fatal error of wishing to claim spiritual properties for objects, which nevertheless, as objects, can never be anything else but nature. In otherwords, the presuppositions of physical science, more or less successfully disguised, are adopted in a sphere, the character of which from beginning to end is not to belong to nature but to something radically different. But really metaphysics in the form of distorted illegitimate physics is something which by this time we ought to have outgrown. Against all dogmatism we raise a demand for criticism, which refuses to be put to silence. Do not go on blundering about with investigation and description of one object after another, but ask yourself first once for all, what you are doing when you investigate, what you want to achieve by it, and by what means and with what prospects of success. Of course a puppy jumps into deep water to fetch out a stick, without knowing beforehand whether he can swim or not. Fortunately he always can. But we are men; and alas such blind confidence in nature is not always advantageous. Thinkers would have saved themselves a lot of trouble if they had understood from the very first that, for example, there is no such problem as that of the freedom of the will at all, so long as I maintain free will as an object in the strict sense of the word. For by doing so I have already conditioned or naturalized this will, i.e. inserted it in a physical context, which I am compelled to think of as determined, in so far as I really think of it at all. How, then, is it possible to ask oneself in the same breath: Can the will be free, i.e. independent of its determined physical context? We get into the same dogmatic blind alley equally with a large number of other metaphysical problems, some of the most important among them, if we do not begin by realizing very clearly in our own minds what we are asking and what it is reasonable for us to ask. The meta- physic of naturalism no less than that of supernaturalism conceals many traps for the unwary. Just as intellectualism binds down the intelligence to a reality, which essentially and ultimately always presents itself as something opposed to the subject, so it further enslaves the will to the intelli- gence. Knowledge counts more for the intellectualist than anything else. To know here transcends everything else, strength of will battling and striving through life, the depth of feeling and the creations of imagination. Intellectualism has a far firmer faith in science than in man, who prosecutes science. Yet what else in the world does this imply but to enslave life itself in its inmost essence to something external, to an object? 395</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY What else is it but what Kant calls the heteronomy of the will? What else is it but naturalism ? If we assume that there really exists a nature on its own, a "pure experience," which gives a quite definite lead to our cognitive activity, and to which we are able gradually more and more to approximate with our concepts, although we seem to be unable ever to apprehend it completely, then each step forward on the way of knowledge must inevitably imply a curtailment of the possibilities of life and con- currently also a diminution of life itself. The victories of knowledge are then won at the cost of life. We find here a parallel to the famous operation which succeeded, although the patient died. The final result of intellectualism is the mechanizing of life and spiritual bondage. There is only one way of rescuing spiritual freedom. That is to bring the whole of life under the heading not of "I know" but of "I believe, hope, dream of and will." Are people then still too blind to see, that in every case to tie down knowledge once for all to life as an object simply means to quench hope and to erect a barrier; too blind to see, that the inmost recess of the isolated self-satisfied understanding is a negation, opposed to everything bearing the name of human and spiritual life ? Unhappy man, were he only able to live in virtue of his knowledge and for the purpose of getting to know more and more! Do you reply perchance: "What you say may be true, or it may be false. Anyhow, with knowledge I stand or fall. If it lead me even to the gates of hell, I will knock to enter there"? That was the opinion once expressed by the Swedish thinker Hoijer. Well, I think that this last rejoinder is just bluff. I can imagine anyone's pursuit of knowledge taking him over the threshold of annihilation, but not over the threshold of hell. No one in his right mind would choose to go to that length, however distinguished the company he might find there. But let us drop the whole idea straight away as at any rate unnecessary. The understanding and science are negative and deadening, no doubt, when they bow their necks to absolute objects. But they only do this so long as they fail to know themselves, as they really are. Once they have grown a little beyond infancy, the nightmare of naturalism will cease to fascinate them. Then they will change their tune completely. Then they will no longer persist in slaving under dead objects, but forthwith revolt and pass over to offer their services freely to life, that unending life which never becomes rigid in points or stands still before barriers. 396</page></plain_text>
