There was a time when sentiments relating to the things of the physical world opposed with equal energy the establishment of the physical sciences, because they, too, had a religious or moral character. We believe, therefore, that this prejudice, pur sued from one science to the next, will finally dis appear also from its last retreat, sociology, leaving a free field for the true scientific endeavor (p. 34).

Read Bain, a sociologist, speaks of "culturology" in "Trends in American Socio logical Theory" (in Trends in American sociology, G. A. Lundberg et al., editors, New York, 1929). Dr. Cheng Che-Yu published Oriental and Occidental cultures contrasted: An introduc tion to "culturology," in 1943 (Berkeley, Calif.). He has written me that he has used "cultur osophy" as well as "culturology" in earlier pub lications in China. I first used "culturology" in print in 1939, I believe ("A Problem in Kinship Terminology," Amer. Anthrop. 41: 566-573), but I employed it regularly in lectures for some years prior to that date. "Culturology" may, from its novelty, sound affected or pretentious today. But we recall that friends of Herbert Spencer condemned the word "sociology" as a "barbarism" (Preface to vol. 1, Principles of sociology). "Culturology" also will become familiar with the maturity of "social" ^science and will eventually be accepted as a matter of course. If the scientific study and inter pretation of mammals is "mammalogy," the science of minerals "mineralogy," of music, "musicology," why should not the science of culture be called "culturology"? The importance of new words for new conceptions is well expressed by Henri Poincaré: "... the true discoverer will not be the workman who has patiently built up some of these combinations, but the.man who has brought out their relation. . . .

If Dürkheim could only have used "culture" and "culturology" instead of "society," "collec tive consciousness," "collective representations," and "sociology," he would have spared himself misunderstanding that has persisted even to the present time. His failure to do so is remarkable in view of his realization of the necessity of new concepts and new terms as science advances: "We need ... to formulate entirely new con cepts, appropriate to the requirements of science and expressed in an appropriate terminology" (p. 37, The rules). 93 "So-Called Social Science," p. 238.</page><page sequence="20">200 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 37, NO. 6 phrase "science of culture," however.
