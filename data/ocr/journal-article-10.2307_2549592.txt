<plain_text><page sequence="1">19491 Book Reviews Theories of Welfare Economics. By HLA MYINT. The London School of Economics and Political Science. Longmans, Green &amp; Company, London. 1948. Niv -+ 240 PP. Thliis book will challenge the interest of economic thcorists every- where. Dr. Myint has beenl privileged to study under two great teachers, Hayek and Hicks, and he has brought to his researches an obviously judicious, analytical, and articulate intelligence. The result can be regarded as a fair sample of modern Anglo-Saxon economic thouglt- that body of written and unwritten analysis, recently infused by Austrian blood and lightly kissed by mathematics. In appraising the book, I shall pay it the compliment of judging it in the unsparing fashion appropriate to an important contribution to modern thought. Myint attempts to give a survey of welfare economics since the time of Adam Smith and also attempts to find out what types of welfare economics are likely to prove most usefuil for the purpose of practical policy. The first third of the book deals with the classical writers prior to the so-called marginal revolution of the 1870s. Part II, which is about half the book in length, deals with the neo-classical views on welfare economics, including Pareto and up through Pigou's Economics of Welfare. The final brief section brings in the broader philosophical questionings of Knight, J. M. Clark and others as to whether the preferences in terms of which people act in the market-place have ethical validity, and whether formal economic theorising about behaviour is very fruitful. About Part III's philosophical inquiries, I have little to say. Myilnt is judicious and he has read widely; the topics covered are ones upon which views differ greatly and at many points a different synthesis of judgment would be possible. In some ways, the most interesting part of ethics is what is left out-all inter-personal normative com- parisons. At the beginning of the book Myint tells us that this is not part of " economic welfare " but belongs to the field of "general social welfare which cannot be analysed in purely scientific and quantitative terms " (p. xi). Eigo, the subject is almost never discussed. Now at the time wheni Lionel Robbins wrote his Essay on the Nature and SigniJficance of Economnic Science, it was probably necessary for students steeped in the traditions of Edgeworth, Cannan, Marshall, and Pigou to divest themselves of the quaint notion that there exists a quantity of social utility, made up of a sum of the cardinal satisfactions of different individuals, and of about the same 'degree of objectivity as the observation that price and quantity are inversely related illonog a market demand curve. B3ut this does not j ustify the belief on the 371</page><page sequence="2">372 PCONOMICA [NOVEMIEk part of anyone that policy prescriptions can be made independent of normative judgments concerning different people; and that there exists no analytical field of welfare economics concerned with the deductions of the implications of various arbitrarily given ethical precepts (i.e., Bergson " social welfare functions "). For a brief period, those who took their Robbins too literally grasped at the straw of a "new welfare economics " which was to be independent of inter- personal ethical elements. But freed from the obscurities of geometry and Paretian French, the new welfare economics stands revealed as being merely a set of incomplete necessary conditions whose whole raison d'etrte disappears if the additional ethical conditionls are not adjoined. No reader of Myint is likely to gain from the book many notions as to what the above paragraph is all about, or how to go about relating the " old" to the " new" welfare economics. Nonetheless, Part II, particularly Chapter VII dealing with " The Theory of the General Optimum " along the lines of Pareto and Hicks, will probably prove to be the most valuable part of the book to the student of intermediate and advanced economic theory. I myself most enjoyed the retrieving of Henry Sidgwick from oiit of Marshall's corona; Myint brings out the liftle-known fact that Pigou's welfare economics traces back to Sidgwick almost more than to Marshall. Aside from giving samples of Marshall's " Victorian morality ", Myint devotes the longest chapter of the book to an approving discus- sion of the " Marshallian Surplus Analysis ". He seems to regard this as " practical ", or at least more so than the analysis of Pigou and Pareto; but just why Myint thinks it practical, I cannot find out. This is a realm in which Marshall was not only vague but full of blunders: much of what he says is nonsense and is unsaid at other parts of the book; and the fact that Marshall avoids some of the errors of his followers is a tribute to him and not to his brain-child, consumer's surplus. And yet this doctrine is usually regarded as Marshall's most important analytical contribution--a damning and cruel verdict, indeed. Only Hicks has given a defensible formulation of consumer's surplus and in his hands it becomes nothing more nor less than a particular reformulation of indifference loci : the single important purpose of the concept is to help make decisions in the large-i.e., to decide whether it would be better to take a large finite (rather than small) step away from a particular position; and to this aspect of the problem Myint devotes almost none of his thirty pages. Instead he reproduces, without apparent disapproval, Figures 30, 3I and 32 from Marshall's Principles, designed to show that increasing cost industries should usually be taxed in order to expand decreasing cost industries. Yet Myint is clearly aware that these unwarrantedly neglect producer's surplus in arriving at their conclusion, and he is also aware that in Figure 33 Marshall in effect points out the errors in reasoning of Figure 3 1 .</page><page sequence="3">t949J1 BOOK REVIEWS 373 Part I impressed me as the least satisfactory part of the book. Myint argues that modern economists believe that efficient allocation of resources was the " central problem " of classical economics; he argues that this was not their central problem; and if it was not, he asks what was ? After casting about for an answer, he comes up with the thesis that their " central problem " was that of raising the technical productivity of the economy, and that their labour theory of value predisposed them to a man v. nature view of the economic problem rather than to a tightening up of the efficiency of the economy by means of marginal conditions. He warns against the anthropo- morphic sin of reading into earlier writers the analysis of present-day economic theory. He works hard to establish this thesis, desperately hard, and succeeds in giving it a certain superficial plausibility. But upon closer examina- tion of his dialectics and after chasing down his references, I found it increasingly unconvincing. There was no one central problem of classical economics, and to knock one out as pretender does not pave the way for establishing another on the throne. The author is so carried away with his own argument that he even ends up with the conclusion that Smith's afterthought on " productive labour ", one of his few belated quasi-borrowings from the physiocrats, is the most important part of his doctrines. As I chased down the author's references, again and again I felt his thesis led him to read things out of his authors that were there. For example, Smith did realise and state the consumer's surplus arising from exchange; secondly his analysis of the advantages of the division of labour can be interpreted (and in effect has been by Ohlin) in terms of the later Hicks-Kaldor diagrams (p. I I 3). Smith did cheerfully acquiesce to Bentham's criticism of his own uncharacteristic leniency toward the laws of usury. And as Myint himself clearly shows, the classical theory of comparative advantage is a perfect example of modern welfare economics ; and the classical rent theory, telling how new units of labour will be added to different plots of land, is another such example, beautifully illuminated by the Hicks-Kaldor construction. In short one ends up with the feeling that there is a worse sin than the anthropomorphic one of reading modern analysis into older writers' works. There is in addition the sophisticated-anthropormophic sin of not recognising the equivalent content in older writers because they do not use the terminology and symbols of the present. Space does not permit a more thorough documentation of my skepticism concerning Part I. When a man sets out to prove that England is not an island or that Lytton Strachey wrote the Economic Consequences of the Peace, perhaps we should judge him not by how persuasive is his total argument but by whether he gives us a run for our money; by whether his points are at least near- rather than far- fetched. But then there is the sterner view that Dogmengeschichte F</page><page sequence="4">374 ECONOMICA [NOVEMBER is a game only worth playing if it is played very well indeed. From any viewpoint, Theories of Welfare Economics is a distinguished con- tribution to economic theory. PAUL A. SAMUELSON.</page></plain_text>
