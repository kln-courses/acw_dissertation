Hollimon3 Stimulated by several important, recent empirical advances, California archae- ologists are engaged in a series of lively debates. These advances include new discoveries about the early peopling of western North America and sustained oc- cupation of the California coasts as early as 12-13,000 BP. There also have been significant new developments in the role of paleoenvironmental change in cul- tural evolution, the emergence of long-distance interaction spheres, the presence of intensive craft specializations, and the appearance of sociopolitically complex hunter-gatherers. This article addresses these issues - and several others - with a view to the general interests of scholars worldwide. The exceptional heterogene- ity of California ecosystems (from deserts to dense redwood forests to bountiful offshore islands) and the remarkable cultural diversity exhibited by the dozens of major groups who made these lands their home combine to produce a complex in- digenous sociopolitical picture. Current understandings reveal myriad trajectories of cultural change across nine major subregions of the state. KEY WORDS: California prehistory; hunter-gatherers; peopling of the Americas; paleoenviron- ments; craft specialization; sociopolitical complexity; multiethnic societies; foraging theory. INTRODUCTION California has not only the sixth largest economy in the world but also one of the largest and most prolific archaeological communities. This rich output of published work, virtually all of it about hunter-gatherer groups, may be the world's largest body of archaeological research on one region's hunter-gatherers. A num- ber of significant, anthropologically engaging issues are being explored that are of 1 Department of Anthropology, University of California, Los Angeles, California. 2Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, University of California, Los Angeles, California. 3 Department of Anthropology, Sonoma State University, Rohnert Park, California. 4To whom correspondence should be addressed at Department of Anthropology, 341 Haines (Box 951553), University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095-1553; e-mail: jeamold@ ucla.edu. 1 1059-0161A&gt;4/030(M)001A) © 2004 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">2 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon central relevance to archaeologists around the globe. For archaeologists working on foraging-collecting societies, tapping into this research may be of particular im- portance. Scholars examining sedentism, formal craft specialization, and big-man and chiefdom-level political economies in any cultural context - including farming societies and pastoral societies - also will find much of interest in California. We have two primary goals in this essay. First, we closely examine major debates involving some of the earliest coastal sites in the Americas, the effects of paleoenvironmental disruptions on coastal populations, how sociopolitical com- plexity developed without agriculture, and how multiethnic communities operated in the early historic era. We explore these and other leading topics in the fol- lowing two sections. These salient research issues largely crosscut regions. Then, we turn to a systematic and comprehensive discussion of key recent discoveries within nine primary archaeological regions of the state that correspond, broadly, to traditional ecological/sociopolitical zones. The zonal discussions are necessary because the exceptional ecological diversity of California promoted quite differ- ent regional cultural trajectories in these areas, reflected as well in very different archaeological agendas, research foci, and intensity of investigations today. Our domain is California's prehistory, including occasional reference to the early historic archaeology of native Californians. The early Euro-American pe- riod of the Pacific Coast (including the Gold Rush, the Missions, early pueblos) deserves its own article. We primarily restrict ourselves to research postdating in- fluential volumes by Moratto (1984) and Chartkoff and Chartkoff (1984), which were the last extensive syntheses of California prehistory. Not every important publication can be incorporated into this discussion, given limitations on space. Geographically, our coverage extends from Mexico to Oregon, and from the peaks of the Sierra Nevada range to the coast and offshore islands on the west (Figs. 1 and 2). The east side of the Sierra is within the Great Basin province and is not dis- cussed here. We confine our remarks to published (or in press) and peer-reviewed work, with the rare exceptions of certain widely available conference papers or gray literature reports of recent vintage and unusual influence in current debates. CALIFORNIA AND WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY California archaeologists can be provincial, like archaeologists anywhere; there has been too little comparison with the prehistories of neighboring regions and the wider world - and consequently too little reference to the state's signif- icant cultural history by those working elsewhere. California was barely men- tioned in Price and Brown's (1985) important volume on emerging complexity among prehistoric hunter-gatherers, and the California coastal regions garnered little attention in Kelly's (1995) superb examination of largely egalitarian (gener- alized) foragers and collectors. Binford's (2001) treatment of hunter-gatherers on a global scale barely scratches the California landscape and ignores its more com-</page><page sequence="3">The Archaeology of California 3 Fig. 1.

Now, however, studies focused on California are increasingly leading to international, cross-cultural discussions of hunter-gatherer issues such as pluralistic communities, the peopling of continents, technological advances, and emergent complexity. When Europeans first began to interact regularly with California Indians during the later 1700s and early 1800s, they attracted (or coerced) some California groups into life in complex multiethnic communities such as Fort Ross (Fig. 3), a Russian outpost established to control the north Pacific sea otter fur trade (Lightfoot, 1997a).

Analyses of contact-era mortuary practice and religion (e.g., Green, 1999) reveal that many precontact religious practices survived the first few decades of mission oppression, although mortuary practices were notably if _ 0 100 Kilometers f. // tt Mod« I 0 100 Miles f ' ;/ ' "*"" Gí¿"Baan ® •*' f'' I North if Noiih J ' ; I N- I ' ) Û Com« / » N- ' Û ' ^' Com« '*~y / manto / - h; ' I » ^' manto / ' I ^.ig.

The Island Chumash people continued to live on the northern Channel Islands, absorbing some European goods but, surprisingly, continuing many tradi- tional lifeways until about 1815, manufacturing shell beads and trading extensively (Arnold, 2001a; Arnold and Graesch, 2001; Graesch, 2001). Native experiences during this turbulent time were highly divergent across the state (Allen, 1998; Voss, 2000) and were soon followed by bursts of widespread genocide (for in- stance, during the Gold Rush in the Sierra Nevada) and systematic and persistent efforts at cultural extinction. It is remarkable that members of so many California groups remained when, during the early 1900s, ethnographers Alfred Kroeber, John Peabody Harrington, and others began to do memory ethnography by collecting oral narra- tives, linguistic data, and genealogies. Their work resulted in a rich and massive yet uneven ethnographic record of selected groups that has been very important in the development of the state's archaeological record. Enormous potential re- mains to draw further on these data, to expand archaeological study of California's contact-era traditional groups, and to tie new findings to global studies of contact situations. Another way that California is contributing to archaeological studies of cross- cultural interest is in the theoretical and empirical examination of sociopolitical complexity (simple chiefdom political organization) without agriculture. The study of complex hunter-gatherers in California has focused primarily on the Chumash in the southern coastal region (e.g., Arnold, 1991, 1992a, 1995a, 2001a,b,c; Kennett, 1998) and has generated comparisons of the nature of Chumash complexity with groups outside California, including the affluent or complex coastal groups in the Northwest Coast and peoples in southern Florida (the Calusa), Japan, the Canadian Plateau, coastal Australia, and Mesolithic Europe (Arnold, 1993, 1996a,b, 2000a, 2001a). Studies of the labor organization of complex hunter-gatherer groups on a cross-cultural basis suggest that formal, hereditary political leadership has its ori- gins in the ability of elites to maintain renewable control over the labor of non-kin. This process is blind to the subsistence regime, meaning that farmers, pastoral- ists, or hunter-gatherers may become politically complex if (but not because) demographic and food resource conditions partially enable such transformations. Arnold et al. (1997b) and others (Jones et aU 1999) have explored stresses as major stimuli for the emergence of complexity, and Hayden (1995) has invoked prosperity and abundance of resources as paving the way to greater complexity, but many anthropologists agree that people's manipulation of others' labor was a (or perhaps the) key process in political evolution. Other treatments of labor, practice theory, pluralistic societies, and culture contact that draw heavily on California-based data include Lightfoot et al. (1998) and Silliman (2001). Useful comparisons of California and Northwest Coast cul- tures effectively highlight distinctions between these two great regions that sup- ported more politically complex nonagricultural societies than perhaps any other</page><page sequence="7">The Archaeology of California 7 world area (Arnold, 2001a; Lightfoot, 1993; Moss and Erlandson, 1995) yet also were home to many band- and tribal-level societies (Bettinger, 1991; Kelly, 1995). Indeed, California provides a rich venue for the study of evolutionary trajecto- ries of noncomplex hunter-gatherers - those now typically termed "generalized" (simpler foragers) and "affluent" hunter-gatherers. Affluent hunter-gatherers were not politically organized as chiefdoms but lived in relatively productive settings, subsisted by collecting, were semisedentary, and exhibited other kinds of eco- nomic, social, and/or religious elaboration (Arnold, 2001a, p. 3). Organizational elaboration emerged even in less verdant places. For instance, some California desert groups shifted from mobile foraging to increasingly logistically organized collecting in concert with private ownership of resources (Basgall, 2000; Bettinger, 1999). Bettinger (1991, pp. 100-103) examines the change from "traveler" to "processor" mode in terms of decreased mobility, intensified exploitation and pro- tection of holdings, emergence of storing and caching behaviors, and increased territoriality in some of California's most extreme arid zones. California scholars have been leaders in the use of ethnohistorical sources (e.g., mission registers) and DNA to address archaeological and demographic/ genealogical questions (Johnson, 2000b, 200 1 ; McLendon and Johnson, 1 999) and the use of ethnographic materials to examine identity and gender issues and mor- tuary behavior (Hollimon, 2001). Quite heated debates about native Californian cultural identity and the process of ethnogenesis have emerged from controversial archaeological projects in the southern part of the state. Haley and Wilcoxon (1997, 1999) suggest that the subtle reshaping and re-reporting of J. P. Harrington's field notes by contemporary ethnographers has dramatically changed perceptions of lo- calities such as Point Conception (Fig. 2). They argue that the assertion that Point Conception was the formal spiritual "western gate" for the Chumash is a mod- ern construct, yet it has shaped professional, public, and Chumash understandings of spiritual beliefs and the meaning of that prominent piece of land. Others ob- ject strenuously to this characterization. Field (1999), Haley and Wilcoxon (2000; Haley, 2002), and others (in associated commentaries) have continued to debate these highly charged, identity-related issues. Another case underscoring the role of archaeologists and anthropologists in modern cultural identity formation - and the politics of archaeology and development - focuses on the village of Puvunga, birthplace of the Gabrielino religious leader Chinigchinich, in the southern Los Angeles Basin (Boxt and Raab, 2000, and associated rebuttals). The precise loca- tion of the village site is hotly contested, and its politicization has had a profound effect on local constituencies. Important studies of health and disease in colonial contact situations in California have implications for our understanding of pre- 1800s community orga- nization and complexity and may illuminate some significant differences in these processes in various western North American regions (Erlandson and Bartoy, 1 995; Lightfoot and Simmons, 1998; Preston, 1996; Walker and Johnson, 1992, 1994).</page><page sequence="8">8 Arnold, Walsh, and Hoilimon Erlandson and Bartoy (1995), for example, provide a review of historic encoun- ters in the Chumash region and outline three possible models of the course of spread of contagious diseases. Unexpectedly, they find essentially no direct ev- idence of major epidemics. New evidence from Santa Cruz Island (Arnold and Graesch, 2001) shows economically thriving villages of bead makers from 1782 to the 1810s, further illustrating that epidemics may have exacted a more limited toll than once thought. Reflecting on these results, we find it illuminating that local accounts and oral narratives are mostly mute on the subject of epidemics and widespread disease-induced suffering, whereas we would expect substantial recounting of tales of sickness had massive epidemics occurred. In southwestern Canada, for instance, a smallpox epidemic in 1782 devastated local populations and is recounted at length in many Storlo stories (Carlson et al.% 2001). For now, the true scale of epidemics in several parts of California before 1800 remains a puzzle. There is no doubt that crowding and resource stress profoundly affected California's precontact indigenous populations. Years ago, Cohen (1981) com- pared California and Jomon adaptations and suggested that crowding and food stress served as stimuli to subsistence change, sedentism, and more elaborated so- ciopolitical organization - much as he had argued that people elsewhere turned to early agriculture due to subsistence stress. The topic of subsistence stress became important in California during the 1980s, generating discussions by scholars in every corner of the state about paleoclimate, overpredation, technological change, population movements, and the like. Lambert (1993, 1994), Lambert and Walker (1991), Jones et al. (1999), and others show that climatic disturbances and wider social and political events notably affected human health through time. Stress- ful periods resulted in poorer diet, more disease, and more violence. Widespread droughts in the west during the early second millennium AD particularly affected the well-being and economic organization of many Californian and Southwestern peoples. As world archaeology has become increasingly engendered, so too has our read on California's past. McGuire and Hildebrandt (1994) examine a range of tools and food staples in the California Millingstone period (c. 8000-4000 years ago) and suggest that the absence of clear gender referents in burials ofthat age is tied to a lack of gender polarity in the division of labor. Women and men procured and processed plant and animal staples such as seeds, small game, and shellfish during this period in diverse (rather than female-only) task groups, perhaps because it was a warm, dry period that generated food stresses and required a broad-based subsistence strategy. Millingstone sites typically have abundant milling equip- ment and few hunting tools, so a single-gender interpretation of milling tools as women's tools would make most sites solely "women's sites," which McGuire and Hildebrandt rightly raise as an interpretive problem. For the following period, Jackson (1991) suggests that women of the Sierra Nevada began to invest for</page><page sequence="9">The Archaeology of California 9 the first time in making and using substantial bedrock mortars for their acorn processing, thus sharply differentiating their subsistence roles from men's roles. Jones ( 1 996) also endorses the notion of a more gendered division of labor emerg- ing with the development of mortar and pestle technology in the central coast region c. 5500 years ago, which was prompted by reduced foraging mobility and population growth. Despite these advances, in most analyses of these types, hunting-fishing is assigned to men once it appears as an important role, and plant and shellfish col- lecting are assigned to women. As with the widespread ascription of groundstone tools to women and flaked stone to men, steps need to be taken to correct such oversimplifications (Walsh, 2000). We must demonstrate rather than assume the tenability of these assignments and more closely examine the gender-based di- vision of labor in all kinds of work (Hollimon, 1990). Moreover, not only can mortuary practices not be easily and unequivocally read from grave goods - even from burials of known age/sex - but assumptions about the gender association of grave goods should be examined more closely. Mortuary and subsistence behav- iors were nuanced, complex, and variable, and multiple interpretations must be weighed. Stimulating investigations at the intersection of archaeology, biological an- thropology, and culture also touch on gender and occupations, relying on examina- tions of skeletal remains (e.g., Walker and Hollimon, 1989). Hollimon (2000) has made inferences about the gender-based division of labor from activity-induced pathologies such as degenerative joint disease, and she has assessed gender in rela- tion to occupational guilds and mortuary evidence among the Chumash (Hollimon, 1990, 1997, 2000, 2001). For instance, Chumash 'aqi (third gender persons), who were specialized undertakers, may have been members of a very early occupational guild and may have experienced occupational stresses in the form of repetitive- motion injuries to their spines. Cultural resources management is a major part of California's archaeological heritage. It is telling that nearly one in five Register of Professional Archaeolo- gists (ROPA) members in the U.S. works in California. Michael Moratto 's (1992) thorough review of CRM in California, from its birth through the early 1990s, tells a fascinating tale of the people, projects, legislation, successes, and massive scale of the CRM enterprise and its broader contributions to the discipline. OTHER SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH THEMES The Peopling of the Pacific Coast The careful redating of so-called "early man" sites and skeletons in California and close scrutiny of other evidence has resulted in the sound rejection of previous claims for great antiquity (14,000-50,000 years or more) for the Calico Hills locus,</page><page sequence="10">10 Arnold, Walsh, and HoHimon the Santa Rosa Island mammoth "kill" sites, the BART and Sunnyvale skeletons, and others. But in their place, the California coast and Channel Islands are yielding a whole new suite of early sites with important implications for our understanding of the peopling of the Americas. We can now seriously address the possibility of a coastal migration into the New World and the antiquity and nature of human uses of coastal resources. Scholars worldwide should take note of the impressive numbers of sites dating to 10-13,000 years ago in southern California coastal and island areas that reveal a strong marine or littoral focus. Some of these very early sites appear to be coastal residential bases. This may be the best early evidence for the persistent use of marine resources anywhere in the Americas. A coastal migration hypothesis from northeast Asia into the northern Amer- icas has been discussed for some years by various scholars, and its tenets are well outlined by Erlandson (1994, 2002). Evidence from California is more than suffi- cient to dismiss notions promulgated by Yesner ( 1 987) and others that North Amer- ican coasts were not occupied until very late in prehistory. Also easily dismissed are arguments by Osborn (1977) and Cohen (1977) that coasts were marginal habitats and that only population pressure or other population-resource imbalances forced people to begin to use marine resources such as shellfish. Groups settled along the coasts and estuaries well before 10,000 years ago and gained most of their protein from a variety of marine sources; fish and shellfish were important from very early times (Rick and Erlandson, 2000). The site of Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in the northern Channel Islands has yielded the earliest human skeleton on the Pacific Coast and perhaps in all of North America, dating to c. 1 3,300 years ago- contemporary with Clovis (Johnson et al., 2000). Daisy Cave on nearby San Miguel Island (SMI-261 ) has pro- duced substantial faunal material and artifactual material dating to nearly 13,000 years ago (Erlandson, 2002), including the earliest woven plant fibers/basketry on the Pacific Coast (over 12,000 years old) (Connolly et a/., 1995). The fiber speci- men construction is consistent with distinctive Z-twisted cordage that continued to be made in the same region during much later periods, perhaps arguing for cultural continuity between early island occupants and the Chumash known historically. Continuity also is indicated by many other kinds of artifactual and biological evi- dence over many millennia (see sources below); indeed, the Chumash occupation of this region may have an uninterrupted time depth duplicated in few places in the Americas. Clear evidence has emerged for nearshore fishing (rocky shore and kelp bed habitats) at Daisy Cave by c. 12,000 years ago, and fish constituted more than 50% of the meat diet during early occupations (Rick et ai, 2001). Mainland sites of almost this age show instead a focus on bay-estuary habitats, and fish constituted less than 15% of the meat diet. Most mainland sites and some island sites reveal an emphasis on shellfish acquisition (at least 80% of the diet), reflecting regional adaptive diversification (Erlandson et al.9 1999; Erlandson and Rick, 2002a; Rick</page><page sequence="11">The Archaeology of California 1 1 and Erlandson, 2000). Although the suggestion that lifeways and technologies were already like those of the Historic Chumash by some 9000 years ago (Rick et al., 2001, p. 609) is not warranted, all scholars agree that some elements of littoral and marine focus were in place very early. There may not have been large boats, but at least some form of watercraft carried people to and from islands and out over the kelp beds for regular fishing - possibly large tule balsas or rafts, or even skin boats. The earliest site identified thus far on Santa Cruz Island is Punta Arena (c. 8900 BP) (Glassow, 2000). With some dates corresponding to terminal Pleistocene occupation in parts of coastal California, scholars sought to reevaluate models advanced by Moratto (1984) and Chartkoff and Chartkoff (1984) about the earliest peoples along the coast. The Chartkoffs argued that people arrived at the coast during the Early Holocene after they occupied the interior west, which then was becoming increas- ingly arid and resource poor, whereas Moratto argued for separate early coastal (Paleo-Coastal) and interior traditions. Published réévaluations began with Jones (1991, 1992), who contends that arriving populations centered their activities at very early dates around lakes, estuaries along the coast, and the offshore islands. People seized on different high-yield resources in various places up and down the coast (in some, shellfish; in some, marine mammals; in others, elk), leading to highly localized adaptations (see also Erlandson, 1997a, p. 7). For the San Diego region, many argue that early coastal residents arrived from the interior during a xeric period, as originally proposed by Warren (1968). Gallegos (1991) suggests that about 9000 years ago people left the desiccating lakes of the Great Basin and moved to the newly formed coastal estuaries (created by the inundation of rivers during post-Pleistocene sea-level rise) along the San Diego coast. His inferences are based largely on similarities in tools and the means by which various species were exploited in the interior desert and coastal estuary areas. Although the evidence is fairly compelling, many questions remain about this early phase in San Diego, particularly because some early coastal Millingstone sites in San Diego and on the central coast now seem to predate the onset of marked Early Holocene aridity. Koerper et al. ( 1 99 1 ) suggest that the San Dieguito (earlier and estuary focused) and La Jolla (later and more coastally focused) traditions are one and the same people, and if they were locally predated by anyone, the evidence is probably out on the continental shelf, a good reminder that some early sites have obviously been lost to sea-level rise. Recent discoveries on the central coast (Fitzgerald, 2000, pp. 1 17-132; Jones et tf/., 2002) show that the Cross Creek site, near San Luis Obispo, is - at roughly 12,500 years old - the earliest known mainland site with a shell midden and abun- dant milling equipment. Jones and colleagues suggest that such an early date near the coast makes an interior Paleoindian, big-game hunting ancestry unlikely. The subsistence pattern seems unique to California and represents a very early adap- tation to peri-coastal settings through extensive use of plant foods and the littoral</page><page sequence="12">12 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon zone. Artifact assemblages recovered seem wholly unrelated to Clovis, and the cobble tools seem much more like those of early Pebble Tool Traditions of the Pa- cific Northwest (Carlson, 1990). Such possible connections lend credence to North Pacific coastal migration theories (Erlandson, 2002). Millingstone sites are present on much of the southern and central California coast by 9000 years ago, but this milling tool-dominated tradition may be absent on the Channel Islands (Erlandson and Colten, 1991) due to different dietary emphases and raw materials there. On the southern Channel Islands, the Eel Point site (SCLI-43) was originally reported to be 9000 years old, with plenty of early nearshore fishing (Sails, 1991), although Raab (1997) has now adjusted the earliest Eel Point dates to about 8000 BP. Raab and colleagues suggest that more important than early fishing was early marine mammal hunting (M. Raab and A. Yatsko, personal communication, 2002). Porcasi et al (2000) also emphasize the marine mammal hunting and shellfishing dominant on San Clemente Island during the earliest phases of residence. These assemblages, taken together with those of the state's other coastal regions, indicate versatile hunting, collecting, and/or fishing adaptations within distinctive localized marine settings at very early dates. Foraging and Subsistence Management Practices Archaeologists disagree about precontact Californian foraging practices and the magnitude of their alterations of the biota and landscape. To some scholars, the first Californians were guardians of nature. Others see them as active man- agers, and still others compare them to all other populations who have depleted resources and contributed to environmental degradation. Grayson's (2001) stimu- lating article about human impacts on animal populations around the globe reveals that longstanding debates about indigenous "conservationism" have come to a boil. Overpredation and minor extinctions are documented worldwide, but mas- sive extinctions were rarely caused by humans alone (consider also the effects of predators, fire, and climate) (Gray son, 2001). Yet no ecosystem was left unaltered by humans. Populations create radical changes in biotic communities no matter the prevailing attitude toward conservation, and people were rarely able to manage resource depression. The burning of wildlands to stimulate seed and nut yields was widespread in California, as were other kinds of manipulation and management of ecosystem resources to maximize yields and improve plant quality (Blackburn and Anderson, 1993). Indeed, California Indians displayed a sophisticated understanding of their natural world (Anderson, 1993; Bean and Lawton, 1993); some practiced a kind of "proto-agriculture," referring mainly to various pursuits linked to undomesticated plants. Many Californians were effective resource managers, but this means neither that they left their ecosystems unaltered (indeed, all agree that they did not) nor that</page><page sequence="13">The Archaeology of California 13 some plant or animal species were not overexploited on their watch. King (1990) carries the proficient manager approach farther, claiming that highly successful management and use of resources by the Chumash meant that broad ecological stresses had no real impact on their social evolution. Johnson (2000a) acknowl- edges important climatic fluctuations but also implies that the Chumash skillfully managed the operation of their trade systems at contact, beneficently evening risk and redistributing crucial resources for all. As more comprehensive archaeological data emerge on long-term uses of plant resources, in particular, we can continue to refine our evaluations of the effects of past ecosystem manipulations (Martin and Popper, 2001; Reddy, 1999; Timbrook, 1993). Many scholars are trying to gauge the effects of overpredation and/or the im- pacts of paleoenvironmental changes, including climatic and oceanic changes, on cultural evolution. Consensus about details is elusive in all regions. For the south- ern Channel Islands, Sails (1991) suggests that subsistence changes over several thousand years at the Eel Point site can be attributed to human overexploitation of resources - but not environmental change, for which he argues the evidence is marginal at best. Sails uses concepts loosely associated with "intensification" to describe population pressure and the overexploitation of local fish and shellfish species, creating alternate stable states, or cycles of resource crashes. For the Mid- dle Holocene southern Channel Islands as a whole, Raab (1997, p. 33), however, points to optimal conditions, lack of stress, good health, and no overexploitation or loss of foraging efficiency until the Late Holocene - at which time some of these changes did occur. This characterization would appear to contradict Sails' inferences about overpredation at mid-Holocene Eel Point. Yatsko (2000) clearly documents periods of persistent and severe drought in San Clemente Island pre- history. Using a series of radiocarbon dates from his extensive survey programs, he closely links population trends to these climatic changes, noting especially the very xeric Medieval Climatic Anomaly at AD 1050-1250 and the sharp residential shifts associated with use of the island's most reliable fresh water. Differing views on the primacy of paleoenvironmental change versus over- predation also have emerged in relation to the analysis of the hunting of Pacific Coast sea mammals. Hildebrandt and Jones ( 1 992), Jones and Hildebrandt ( 1 995), Lyman (1995), Cohen and Arnold (1998, 2000), and Colten (2002) have debated the relative importance of different classes of marine mammals in early hunt- ing regimes as indicative of overexploitation or sea surface temperature (SST) change and/or as stimuli to the development of high-capacity boating technology. Hildebrandt and Jones (1992) started the debate by arguing that up and down the Pacific Coast, specific, easily captured marine mammal species (shore-based breeders) representing large meat packages would have been exploited first by early residents, followed by other sea mammals and then other faunal classes in a predictable order consistent with optimal foraging principles. This resulted in sequential overpredation and drove technological changes and human settlement.</page><page sequence="14">14 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon Others vigorously contest some or all of these claims and point out that, among other problems, empirical evidence pouring in from various regions indicates that no such simple, singular sequence was followed. Local and regional differences in the marine resources exploited on the California coast (and the localized primacy of fish and shellfish in some areas) were clearly rooted in a range of important ecological, cultural, and technological variations (Cohen and Arnold, 1998). Porcasi and Fujita (2000) discuss abundant dolphin remains at early sites on the southern Channel Islands. They show that the capture of dolphins may depend on disorienting and trapping them in shallow waters and does not always require large, seaworthy boats. Such techniques could thus have been used to procure cetaceans near shallow submarine canyons in any period without large boats. Dolphins often overshadow numbers of pinnipeds recovered from early sites in this region. Taking up the above debate, they suggest that marine mammal optimal prey rankings, which rank pinnipeds above cetaceans, require réévaluation. Conversely, the early marine mammal assemblages at the Eel Point site indicate overhunting of pinnipeds consistent with optimal foraging models (Porcasi et al., 2000), followed by an overall increase in marine mammals and eventually a rise in the numbers of small cetaceans and shored-based breeders captured. Clearly, there is little agreement on the data (or the better model) even from single islands, and several independent contradictions of a progressive overexploitation model are emerging. Other empirical exceptions have arisen to the expectation of a simple pro- gression of diet-breadth widening during the Holocene. Hildebrandt and McGuire (2002) examine Holocene large-animal hunting in California from an evolutionary ecology perspective. They weigh both the enhanced Darwinian fitness of hunters who gained valuable returns from large-game acquisition (through increased pres- tige, debts incurred by those who receive meat from them, and increased mate selection opportunities) and the more mundane calculus of hunting efficiency and prey rank (the ranking of food resources by means of net yields). They view large- game hunting as a showy procurement of meats that became "public goods" and at the same time benefited hunters. They find that California groups did not ex- ploit progressively smaller animals during the Early (c. 3500-2000 BC) to Middle periods (2000 BC-AD 1000); indeed, the pattern was reversed, with ample showy game hunting in the latter period (Hildebrandt and McGuire, 2002, p. 237). They also show that massive biface production (hunting-linked paraphernalia) in Cali- fornia corresponds to a post-2000 BC peak in hunting (especially c. 300 BC-AD 700). Rock art at places such as the Coso Volcanic Field was quite prolific at this time as well and may have been associated with a zenith in male hunting magic. Hildebrandt and McGuire also argue that risky and showy swordfishing in the Chumash area began about 2000 years ago, citing data in Davenport et al. (1993). Recently, however, Bernard (2002) has been able to develop a more com- prehensive faunal data set for the area, showing that open-ocean swordfishing</page><page sequence="15">The Archaeology of California 15 (and the capture of certain other large, pelagic, aggressive species) was primarily a post-AD 700-1000 Chumash phenomenon. Swordfish were ceremonially revered (perhaps for their ability to force whales ashore) at earlier dates (Davenport et ai, 1993), but the few swordfish bone specimens older than the late first millennium AD can be almost certainly attributed to strandings and the like. Bernard (2002) and Arnold (1995a) conclude that swordfishing was strongly associated with pres- tige and boat ownership in late prehistory (after AD 1 100 or so), but not before. Only in the second millennium AD were swordfish regularly procured, and only at about that time did the plank canoe likely become sufficiently large and stable to handle that kind of challenging fishing (contra assertions by Gamble (2002)). So whereas the Hildebrandt and McGuire model may not be apropos to this particular case, their general ideas merit further attention. Many archaeologists in California (and elsewhere) routinely and incorrectly label virtually any kind of subsistence change (e.g., more fishing, more shell- fishing, more acquisition of small game, expanded diet breadth) "intensification." They conflate intensification with more extensive use of some resource rather than employing the term to refer to increased per capita labor expenditure for a spe- cific resource or for overall subsistence. A pattern such as more fish acquisition through time is to be expected with a rising population (more people are fishing, hence more fish are procured). This is not the same as more intensified fishing, which should mean more fishing effort (labor) invested per capita, which has to be demonstrated by examination of labor organization and technology. Readers of the California literature should be aware that few cases of clear labor intensification in Boserup's sense have been presented. One of the more convincing cases is Basgall's (1987) discussion of the emer- gence of acorn-based economies in California in the Middle Holocene. He argues that the initial use of acorns was part of diet-breadth expansion and that acorns were labor-intensive, costly resources. They were incorporated into the diet earli- est in the San Francisco Bay region, about 4000 years ago. People turned to acorns under conditions of population pressure, and extraction (processing) costs were high. While not couched in Boserupian terms, Basgall's focus is on labor, and we can infer an increased labor output per capita on overall food acquisition as acorns were added to local economies. In another case, Broughton (1999) has shown that dwindling resources in the San Francisco Bay were met through increasing the size of hunting territories (and thus travel costs rose, as did the probability of con- flict and its associated costs). The organization of hunting parties also may have changed, and the bow and arrow may have been adopted at about the same time, all of which may have contributed to increased labor effort per capita focused on food acquisition. Jones et al. (1999) argue that progressive "intensification" models may not explain cultural evolution, however, and therefore archaeologists must pay close attention also to paleoenvironmental change, including evidence for sustained droughts.</page><page sequence="16">16 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon Raab (1996) grapples with intensification models and two variants of polit- ical economy models (elites as managers and elites as thugs) in characterizing trajectories of cultural evolution in California. He places scholars who emphasize technological changes or reduced foraging efficiency in an "intensification" school (a debatable grouping) and is dismissive of political economy models, which he categorizes as mostly functional and system serving (including studies by Bean and Lawton and others). Despite the unusual classification of some cases and the minimal attention given to the explanatory power of competitive-opportunistic po- litical economy models, Raab rightly acknowledges the evolutionary importance of punctuated change, competition, climate, and stress. He emphasizes that inter- preting these sequences is challenging, so archaeologists need to pay attention to many variables, including paleoclimate and overexploitation. Paleoenvironments: An Example From Southern California Much of the discussion about the relative merits of models of optimal foraging or overpredation and those centered on other kinds of explanations (political, envi- ronmental) depends on accurate and detailed reconstructions of climatic changes. Thus archaeologists have come to rely to a considerable extent on oceanogra- phers, biologists, and paleoclimatologists to provide baseline data that may be useful in assessing conditions people faced in the past. Such data are always sub- ject to réévaluation as methods are refined, and some older models have been substantially revised through the years. Although several key paleoenvironmental sequences have been developed with direct input from archaeologists, it seems that without exception climatic data for all regions have been interpreted in contrast- ing ways by archaeologists, creating a muddled analytical picture. In this section, we confine ourselves to the Santa Barbara Channel and southern Channel Islands region as a case study, since discussions about paleoclimate have been particu- larly salient and contentious in this region. Discussions based on paleoclimatic data have emerged also for other regions, of course, including estuary siltation and sea-level rise in San Diego County (see below), oceanic temperature changes on the central coast (Jones and Kennen, 1999), and long-term drought conditions affecting various areas of the state (Jones et al.y 1999). For the Middle Holocene, Glassow et al. (1994) use oxygen isotope analysis of shells from a midden on Santa Cruz Island, largest of the northern Channel Islands, to verify that cold-water conditions and seasonally variable oceanic con- ditions dominated. They attribute this pattern to greater influence of the cool- water California current at c. 5500-4500 years ago, which resulted in heightened marine productivity. Glassow (1997a, p. 156) further discusses paleoclimate in the Santa Barbara area during the mid-Holocene, focusing on habitat degradation and human use of marginal areas as possible forces in cultural change. Sails (1991, 1992), on</page><page sequence="17">The Archaeology of California 17 the other hand, argues that environmental change did not affect marine resource availability or exploitation in the southern Channel Islands at that time. Other discussions of early trends in faunal exploitation and the role of environmental changes can be found in Bowser (1993), Erlandson (1994), and Glassow (1993). Climatic and oceanic temperature sequences in the region's later periods have attracted a great deal of attention. Because we know more about cultural evolution of the last 1000 years, and because certain important sociopolitical changes are coeval with obvious shifts in rainfall and sea surface temperatures (SST), there has been an intense focus on the climate of the later Middle (c. AD 500-1 150), Transitional (AD 1150-1300), and Late periods (AD 1300-1782). Arnold and colleagues (Arnold, 1992a, 1997, 2001c; Arnold et al, 1997b; Arnold and Tissot, 1993; Colten, 1995, 2001; Pletka, 2001b) have discussed at some length the re- ported changes in SST and (to a lesser extent) rainfall at c. AD 1 150-1250 in the Santa Barbara Channel area. Stresses caused by declining food productivity, crowding, and reduced fresh water supplies played a major role in stimulating op- portunistic emerging elites to reorganize labor in the region by stepping up northern Channel Islands-based craft production (especially the manufacture of shell beads) and cross-channel trade. Those few wealthy islanders who owned prized and ex- pensive plank canoes were in a position to begin to control and shape the direction of cross-channel trade; this series of changes was at the center of an emerging simple chiefdom on the islands (Arnold, 1995a,b, 2001b). Raab et al. (1995) at- tack the SST argument by citing Early period data from the southern Channel Islands, suggesting that elevated SST may be favorable rather than stress-inducing for marine productivity (rebutted by Arnold et al., 1997b). Raab and Larson ( 1 997) suggest that the region 's Transitional-era drought data go much farther than the SST data in accounting for serious stresses experienced by the region's populations. Kennett and Kennett (2000), Kennett and Conlee (2002), and some contributors to the Gerber (1993) volume also offer a critique of the SST data. Those data were originally generated by a Santa Barbara Basin sediment core that led archaeologists to project a period of reduced biotic productivity at AD 1150-1250 (Arnold, 1992a). The Kennett and Kennett paper presents new ocean temperature data and the suggestion that climatic disruptions may have been more salient a few centuries before the Transitional period (c. AD 700-1 100; see also Kennett, 1998). But faunal evidence summarized by Colten (2001) and Pletka (2001b) reveals a very unsettled Transitional period, marked not by marine animal population crashes, as once thought, but by notable shifts in available resources and the adoption of new fish acquisition strategies. Moreover, based on shellfish from a series of dated strata at several Santa Cruz Island sites, there was a clear warm- water event of roughly a century's duration at 1 150-1250 (Arnold and Tissot, 1993). Kennett and Kennett 's (2000) analysis shows the same period to have been a cool-water period. At present, there is no way to reconcile these contradictory results. Clearly there is more work to be done.</page><page sequence="18">18 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon Whatever might have been transpiring climatically and ecologically, major cultural change was accelerating, and poor health and lethal violence peaked during the Santa Barbara region's Transitional period (Lambert, 2002, pp. 217-219). The "health of people living during this period was poor in comparison to that of the people before or after them," according to Walker and Lambert (1989, p. 210). Although some scholars believe that there was a unidirectional decline in health and quality of life from the Early to the Late period, the Late period was a time of lowered violence and somewhat better health than the Transitional (Lambert, 1 993, 1994; Lambert and Walker, 1991; Raab, 1996). Jones et al. (1999) broaden the scope of this analysis, providing data on paleoclimatic declines (especially drought) and cultural changes from three areas of California and the Colorado Plateau during AD 800-1350 (the Medieval Climatic Anomaly). They suggest that populations were relatively high and locked into territories, so when severe droughts struck across the west, problems arose that could not be solved by intensification or smaller-scale adjustments. In some areas, major population movements occurred (Southwest, California's central coast); in others (Santa Barbara) there was a short period of violence and declining health but also increased regional trade and rapid political centralization (Arnold, 1992a, 2000b, 2001b; Jones et al., 1999; Lambert, 1994). Paleoclimate also has been introduced as a powerful variable in cultural changes of the early Historic period (1782-1 830s). Larson et ai. (1994, p. 285) describe the pre-Mission Chumash as well-adapted to their environments and led by persons who acted as benevolent managers (1994, pp. 215-211, 285; see also Johnson, 2000a). They attribute the move of the Island Chumash to the mainland missions to several factors, salient among them overall population pressure, sev- eral severe drought years between 1782 and 1813, elevated SST (1769-1834), and a strong El Niño event in 1815-1816. Many Chumash moved to the missions in 1815 and 1816 (especially islanders). As early as 1800, regional hostilities and mortality were increasing; Larson et al. argue that exchange systems and political systems were in the process of collapsing. However, it now appears that the demise of local lifeways did not occur until slightly later (perhaps 15 years later) on the northern islands. Many islanders continued to subsist and produce craft goods and trade until roughly 1815 (Arnold, 2001a; Graesch, 2001). During the crises and disruptions of this era, the Island Chumash were initially self-sufficient but then opted to move to the missions under pressures created or exacerbated by climatic stresses (Larson et a/., 1994). Large-Scale Exchange Systems Extensive obsidian distribution networks originating from large source areas in northern and central California, and the long-distance exchange systems as- sociated with them, continue to garner considerable attention (Chartkoff, 1992;</page><page sequence="19">The Archaeology of California 19 Jackson and Ericson, 1994). Gilreath and Hildebrandt (1997) demonstrate that long-distance obsidian exchange systems were intensive and sustained prior to about AD 1200 but declined markedly after that (see Jones and Waugh, 1995). Hildebrandt and McGuire (2002) have explained this pattern by contending that extensive obsidian biface exchange in much of California is related to a florescence of big-game hunting between 2000 BC and AD 1000 (especially 300 BC-AD 700). In Chumash territory, a similar decline in long-distance movement of vari- ous lithic goods (after c. AD 1 100) corresponds to a dramatic expansion of more regionally focused and quite intensive local trade systems, primarily within the Chumash sphere and including its most immediate neighbors (Arnold, 1992a,b, 2001a; Pletka, 2001a). Shell beads also were exchanged over long distances in California during cer- tain periods. Evidence for a spatially extensive interaction sphere has emerged for the mid-Holocene at c. 5000 years ago, marked by Olivella biplicata grooved rect- angle (OGR) beads in the southern Channel Islands (San Nicolas, San Clemente, and Santa Catalina islands), Orange County, and the broader Mojave Desert/Great Basin region (Howard and Raab, 1993; Raab, 1997; Raab et al., 1994; Raab and Howard, 2000; Vellanoweth, 1995). The distribution of this bead type, which cor- responds closely to territories occupied by Shoshonean (Takic) peoples at contact, could indicate a very early Shoshonean migration into the coastal region, although many researchers have estimated that the Shoshoneans did not arrive in coastal California until AD 500. If not a migration at that early date, then this was an ex- tensive exchange network among far-flung social/linguistic groups. It is important to note that these beads have not been found in nearby Chumash or San Diego sites. The direction of interaction was clearly on a southwest-northeast axis from coast to desert. Porcasi (1998) describes irregular fired ceramic pieces from Santa Catalina Island with 5000 year-old dates and notes that over 100 similar ceramic pieces were recovered from the Irvine site (ORA-64) in Orange County and other sites to the east. She suggests that these rare artifacts may be further evidence of a broad interaction sphere linking the southern islands with the desert interior. Altschul and Grenda (2002, p. 104) also suggest that settlement and artifactual evidence from the southern islands and southern Los Angeles Basin may indicate an early Shoshonean presence on the coast. Households and Sedentism California archaeologists have done little formal household archaeology of the kind that has become routine in many parts of the U.S. Southwest, North- west Coast, Africa, Mesoamerica, and other regions. By neglecting useful cross- cultural and ethnoarchaeological models of household organization and largely focusing on structural details of isolated houses, Californianists are falling behind. Certainly houses have been excavated competently, but few studies - recent or</page><page sequence="20">20 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon otherwise - have focused on the social unit of the household and its production activities, evolution, and interhousehold relations. A recent CRM report on several excavated housepits in Orange County pieces together changing community orga- nization and structure use at a small community, although the discussion is marred by a problematic overview of Chumash houses meant to provide cross-cultural con- text (Grenda et al.y 1998). Borrowing from this other region, they assign function to unexcavated structures, show "streets" in small precontact Chumash villages, and use data from two sites that are lobes of one village (see Arnold, 1990a, 2001a; McLendon and Johnson, 1999) to try to illustrate multiple prototypical community types. This latter inference and associated discussion are puzzling; fortunately, the archaeological analysis of the data from the excavated houses constitutes a very useful contribution to nascent household archaeology in the region. To bring formal household approaches to the northern Channel Islands region, UCLA initiated a household archaeology project on Santa Cruz Island in 1995. Arnold et al. (1997a), Arnold (2001a), and Graesch (2000) present new data from this fieldwork, a household-based examination of specialized craft production and trade at a series of roughly 30 houses in four Historic-era villages. Excavation of large areas at five of these houses generated abundant data on varying manufac- turing emphases, trade practices, diet, and relative wealth and status of household members. The project includes excavations at a unique redwood pole house occu- pied by high-status residents at one of the region's most important Late/Historic villages, Xaxas (SCRI-240), and the use of remote sensing to locate buried house floors in dense midden deposits (Arnold et a/., 1997a). Rick (in press) has initi- ated a household-based project at the Historic period Santa Rosa Island village of Niaqla (SRI-2), updating Phil Orr's mid-century household investigations there. Gamble (1995) provides a useful guide to size and construction differences between Chumash sweatlodges and houses. Her earlier examination of two house floors at a Goleta Slough village originated in a complex CRM project. Focusing on one house, she observes that villagers did almost no manufacturing - in contrast to the specialists on the northern islands - and claims that the site (Helo') was a trading center (Gamble, 1991). Because several canoes were present on the day a Spanish expedition passed through, she argues that site occupants had "more canoes than any of the other villages" in the region (Gamble, 1991, p. 427), a debatable inference. The conclusion that Helo' was "most likely a trading cen- ter" (p. 444) is thus based on negative evidence (absence of manufacturing data), the presence of beads (which are, however, found at all local villages), and the presence of canoes, some probably attracted by the Spanish visit. She also claims that it was a ceremonial and political "center." These conclusions are best viewed as working propositions about what kind of village this may have been. Inter- pretations could be further improved if other houses can be located around this important slough (estuary), which supported more than 1000 people in a number of villages.</page><page sequence="21">The Archaeology of California 21 The significant issue of early sedentism in the region - which we define as the establishment of communities of any size that were occupied by most residents year round- has been broached by Raab (1997), Raab et al. (1994), and Sails et ai (1993). They make a case for sedentism or semisedentism on San Clemente Island about 5000 years ago, using data from the Nursery site (SCLI-1215). Sails et al. y 993, p. 178) suggest that the labor involved in making houses in the region was substantial (including digging shallow housepits and using whale bone for some structural members) and describe them as "major labor investments" and evidence of "residential permanence." Raab and others argue that more intensive use of fish, in particular, allowed for more sedentary lifeways at this early date. Kennett (1998) discusses villages on the northern Channel Islands (where house construction required less labor) and suggests that people became sedentary by AD 650-700. Others have suggested that the early Chumash might have been sedentary somewhat earlier than this (see Erlandson and Rick, 2002b), possibly even 8000- 9000 years ago, but supporting evidence is currently limited for the Early and Middle Holocene. Grenda et al. (1998) and others have cautioned that sedentism cannot simply be equated with or signaled by the presence of housepits, which can represent seasonal and short-term use, as they discovered at a small Orange County site. It is also important to keep in mind that some very complex and populous societies (e.g., certain of the Northwest Coast groups) maintained semisedentary practices into the Historic period, many moving their entire households, house planks, and contents at least twice yearly. Sedentism has no necessary relationship with particular subsistence practices, social structures, or political complexity. All houses that have been excavated in California are important and interesting in their own right, including those that represent greater labor investments, but they are not necessarily indicators of sedentism, nor does sedentism always indicate complexity. Rock Art California has some of the densest concentrations of prehistoric rock art in the world and many of the most elaborate polychrome panels in the Americas. Here we briefly refer to some recent debates about the interpretations of this art rather than attempting to describe its occurrences, which are numerous and complex and spread across many regions. For instance, Hyder (1989) and Lee and Hyder (1991) have explored rock art across southern California. Hyder has challenged the idea that all rock art generated by groups such as the Chumash is shamanistic or ceremonial while acknowledging that a good deal of it certainly may have been associated with religion and ceremony. He explores the location of rock art panels in relation to habitation sites, the visibility of the images, and the number of people who could view the art, and he determines that panel function is highly variable. Overlapping functions may explain the nature and position of the art. Many sites</page><page sequence="22">22 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon may have functions in both the ceremonial and secular spheres, but Hyder contends that some of the sites are clearly and solely secular. For example, he believes that some of the art was conveying information to "maintain social order," including panels that were highly visible, accessible, and contained very conventional sym- bols that were easily and widely recognized (Hyder, 1989, p. 35). More broadly, Lee and Hyder (1991) suggest that rock art can be used as an indicator« of the type or character of social interaction among neighboring groups; rock art at open, friendly borders communicated messages easily through well-placed and widely recognizable rock art elements that were shared and understood by the respective neighbors. If correct, this would constitute a good indication of accommodating relationships between at least some pairs of ethnic groups in southern California. Conversely, closed borders and less friendly cultural relationships were marked by sharp boundaries in art elements and style. On the other hand, Whitley (1992, 1994, 2000a,b) has forcefully contended that most western North American rock art, from the coast to the Great Basin, can be linked to shamanic activities. Quinlan (2000a,b) and Whitley (2000b), both citing substantial ethnographic research, debate the degree to which shamanic rock art dominated in California (see also discussion under "Mojave Desert" be- low). Hildebrandt and McGuire (2002) argue that a mid-Archaic peak in hunting (300 BC-AD 700) corresponds to extensive rock art at places like Coso and ap- pears, contra Whitley 's assertions, to have been associated with male hunting magic rather than shamanism. Clearly there is room for further investigations of these important questions. REGIONAL ANALYSES We turn next to discussions highlighting other distinctive and notable devel- opments in the major archaeological regions of the state (Fig. 2), beginning on the south coast. The unique culture histories and trajectories of archaeological research in these zones reflect their exceptional ecological diversity. San Diego Coastal Area The first appearance of humans in the San Diego region and the nature of Late period settlement and subsistence have been intensively debated for decades. Gallegos (1991) argues that people moved toward the coast when inland (Great Basin) lacustrine settings desiccated about 9000 years ago. They brought Great Basin toolkits with them and were "preadapted" to xeric, estuary-dotted places, thriving by 8500 years ago. These so-called San Dieguito folks practiced diversi- fied resource exploitation using familiar inland-oriented tools - a continuation of "the Western Pluvial Lakes tradition" (Gallegos, 1991, p. 41 &gt;- and their culture</page><page sequence="23">The Archaeology of California 23 gradually transformed into the La Jolla (coastally oriented) cultural pose. During the following Middle Holocene, favorable conditions dominated. Claude Warren originated the idea, since supported by others (Gallegos, 1992; Masters and Gallegos, 1997), that coastal San Diego was then significantly depop- ulated due to the siltation of the region's many large coastal lagoons during the Late Holocene. Masters and Gallegos (1997, p. 19) describe a phase of "catas- trophic sedimentation" that reduced productivity. Byrd and Reddy (2002) provide a contrasting review of the paleocoastal and lagoonal cycles, showing that most lagoons did not silt in. Indeed, many lagoons supported at least moderate popu- lations throughout the Late Holocene, and there was not an abandonment of the coast. Byrd's (1998) paper is his most pointed refutation of the "coastal decline model." However, Batiquitos Lagoon was one important locus that apparently did silt in, prompting localized abandonment (Gallegos, 2002). Byrd and Reddy (1999, 2002) argue that populations in the northern San Diego region in the post- AD 700 era increasingly relied on small-package food resources (including littoral resources such as small shellfish), reflecting population pressure and increased territoriality (Byrd, 1 998). The Late period (post- AD 700) complexes of bow and arrow, ceramics, cremations, and a reliance on acorns with mortar- pestle technology are found in both inland and coastal zones and seem to point to cultural ties to the desert. Among the important interior-oriented culture areas is San Luis Rey (the Pauma complex), where Delbert True and his students worked for many years (True et ai, 1991). The Shoshonean incursion clearly included this northern San Diego area (Juaneño and Lui seño territories). The Kumeyaay of southern San Diego, however, followed a different trajectory: they were reputed to have originated on the coast, moved to the Colorado River area, perhaps in response to the Shoshonean arrival, and then returned with desert/southwest traits during the Late period. Debates have raged for years (Warren, True, others) about San Diego-area population replacements, gaps, adoptions of new traits by groups that did not move, and the like. Byrd and his colleagues have done considerable fieldwork at Camp Pendleton (at the northern margin of the San Diego region), including systematic examination of flora and fauna at a range of sites (Reddy, 1999; Wake, 1999). These investiga- tions revealed several major residential sites and large numbers of limited-activity shellfish-collecting sites (especially after AD 1400), exhibiting an overall trend of diet broadening during the Late Holocene. Shellfish use was very localized and situational (including heavy Donax gouldii [bean clam] use on central Camp Pendleton) and included lagoon species whenever they were available (Byrd and Reddy, 1999). In southern San Diego, archaeologists have excavated parts of sev- eral large villages near the coast or somewhat inland, representing significant occupation during the later Late and early Historic periods (Christenson, 1992). The sites have typical Late period assemblages (small arrow points, brown ware ceramics, shell beads, and milling tools) and diverse fauna from lagoonal, coastal, and/or terrestrial areas (Gallegos, 2002).</page><page sequence="24">24 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon Laylander (1997a) uses the region's settlement data to problematize Binford's well-known forager-collector dichotomy, finding that the true richness of hunter-gatherer spatial organization is poorly represented in Binford's model. He makes extensive use of Luiseño and Kumeyaay ethnographic and archaeolog- ical data bases and deconstructs the general concept of "settlement" into about 15 dimensions (settlement nucleation, annual range size, etc.) and 20 archaeolog- ical variables (dwellings, site area, tool diversity, etc.). According to Laylander (1997a), these variables require close analysis in order to effectively characterize later settlement systems in southern California. The Los Angeles/Orange County Coast and Southern Channel Islands This arid region, which includes the southern Channel Islands and much of Or- ange and Los Angeles counties, was at contact populated by Shoshonean-speaking groups such as the Gabrielino. However, its much earlier prehistory has been the focus of most research. Remarkably, despite its great isolation, people reached the most remote of the eight Channel Islands, San Nicolas Island (SNI), by 8500 years ago. By 5000 years ago they were participating in a "southern islands inter- action sphere" that included the movement of symbolic items and raw materials (e.g., grooved rectangle beads, steatite) over notable distances (Raab and Howard, 2000). Martz and Rosenthal (2001) summarize current research on SNI, where large-scale surveys and excavations supported by the U.S. Navy have been com- pleted since 1990. More than 525 sites have been recorded, 57 tested, and many radiocarbon dates reported. Martz and Rosenthal emphasize these islanders' appar- ent self-sufficiency and subsistence independence, with essentially no reliance on the mainland. This interaction system was quite distinct from the northern Channel Islands exchange system later in time, which involved more island-mainland con- tact and more transfers including foods (see below). Researchers highlight a strong emphasis on fishing on SNI from a very early period. Little or no mention is made of paleoenvironmental stresses on this island (Martz and Rosenthal, 2001, p. 66). Authors have not engaged in much discussion about how the southern islanders obtained, built, or maintained watercraft that would have been essential in fishing or in travel among the islands. At least one Early period site (c. 3000 BC) on SNI has yielded a significant fish assemblage (&gt;50% of the meat diet), which contrasts with many Santa Cruz Island assemblages of the same age, where fish typically do not exceed 10% of the meat diet (Vellanoweth and Erlandson, 1999). Martz et al (2000) detail findings at Thousand Springs (SNI- 11), an Early and Middle period site with evidence for considerable fishing and shellfishing. Bleitz (1993) examines the faunal collection from SNI-1 1 to evaluate changing meat-related dietary practices over time and finds substantial pinniped exploitation in the early levels and later</page><page sequence="25">The Archaeology of California 25 a more diversified, fish-rich diet. It is not clear how these contrasting views of the site's faunal assemblages have arisen. Although fishing was important on SNI, we note that fish bone densities in the 64,000/m3 range, described as "staggering" (Martz et ai, 2000), are matched at quite a few northern Channel Islands sites and do not seem unusually high for the region. A claim that "important" bead making occurred at SNI-1 1 (Martz et al., 2000, p. 88) is not substantiated by data presentation and thus cannot be compared to the well-documented bead production industries of the northern islands (below). Raab et al. (1994) review extensive recent investigations on San Clemente Island funded by the Navy, including surveys that recorded up to 300 sites/km2 (among the densest concentrations of sites in North America) and substantial testing of residential structures. Emerging from this body of work is important early evidence of the southern interaction sphere extending from the Great Basin to the southern Channel Islands about 5000 years ago (see discussion above and Raab, 1997). There also is substantial new evidence for climatic disruptions and climatic optima on San Clemente Island (Raab, 1997) and considerable human prédation on key resources. Sails (1991), Raab et al. (1994), and Porcasi et al. (2000) discuss the faunal and artifactual assemblages from Eel Point, an important multicomponent site on the island's western coast with early dates (8000 BP range). Yatsko (2000) closely examines the growing evidence for climate-induced stresses and their effects on later settlement systems. The Lemon Tank site on central San Clemente Island has generated new evidence of sacrificial animal burials and the possible origins of the Chiningnichich religion, which flourished during the Historic period (Raab et ai, 1 994). Many of these topics also are discussed in papers in a special double journal issue devoted to this island, originally assembled by the late Clement Meighan (Cameron, 2000). A fishing kit consisting of a seagrass bag and an array of fishing tackle was discovered at the Nursery site on San Clemente; it likely dates to the Middle period (c. AD 450). The tackle includes lithic drills, abraders, rib net-spacers, a bone knife and barbs, pry bars, Haliotis fishhooks and hook blanks, Olivella beads (originally sewn to the bag), a steatite whale effigy, serpentine sinkers, and more (Bleitz and Sails, 1993). It is important because it includes finished fishing gear and all of the equipment to make additional hooks. These fishers possessed a mobile and sophisticated set of tools. From the Little Harbor site on Santa Catalina Island, researchers have gen- erated significant new analyses of faunal assemblages and paleoclimatic indica- tors (Raab et al., 1995; see paleoclimate discussion above). From the rich Santa Catalina soapstone quarries, which were the principal source for large soapstone ollas and bowls in coastal southern California, Howard's (2000) new investiga- tions are revising our understanding of Late period production. Howard surveyed all soapstone-producing zones on the island, yielding many new quarry and sub- surface mining sites. She finds that most of the high-intensity quarries and mines</page><page sequence="26">26 Arnold, Walsh, and Hoi I i mon may be protohistoric. This production system was part of a regional exchange sys- tem that included the northern and southern Channel Islands and the Gabrielino and Chumash mainland zones. Large soapstone ollas and other vessels appear to have been notable markers of elite status throughout the area (Howard, 2000). Tiny Santa Barbara Island supported intermittent visits from c. 2000 BC to AD 1 250, and although it was too small and poorly watered to have had permanent occupants, some of its 1 8 sites are quite substantial and yield a wide range of artifact types, including soapstone bowls, beads, awls, mortars and pestles, and fishhooks (Erlandson et a/., 1992). More work is needed to understand the larger sites and the island's role in wider trade and transportation systems. Rapid development in adjacent mainland Orange and Los Angeles counties over the past two decades has led to substantial new archaeological discoveries in the Gabrielino and Juaneño culture areas. For instance, the large Newport Coast Archaeological Project generated data from several Middle Holocene sites, reveal- ing settlement shifts linked to sea-level stabilization and a long-term abandonment of the Newport Bay area (Mason et al., 1997). Drawing from the presence of im- ported items of Hohokam (southern Arizona) origin, including Glycymeris shell bracelets, baked clay anthropomorphs, ceramics, textiles, and projectile points (Koerper et ai, 1996, 2002), Koerper et al. (2002) argue for far-ranging interior trade connections during the Late Holocene, following part of the Mojave Trail eastward along the Santa Ana River into the desert. Koerper and Hedges (1996) discuss Patayan clay figurines found at ORA-58, the probable Historic village of Genga. Patayan figurines were made in western Arizona or the eastern California desert and were brought or traded by Mojave traders. Koerper et al. (2002) find substantial evidence for subsistence stress and more intensive use of small-package resources such as Donax gouldii, acoms, seeds, and smaller fish coincident with population pressure and territoriality after AD 600 in this area. They suggest that punctuated cultural changes in settlement, trade, and the like dating to the last millennium were due to climatic stresses. By the early Historic period about 20 villages were arranged along the larger streams and bays (e.g, Newport Bay) of this area. Some of these villages would have been large and multiethnic, such as Genga. Although there were strong so- cial and economic connections between the coast and the desert interior, Koerper et al. (1992) dismiss a long-debated desert-centered interpretation that a "jasper" material at the Tomato Springs site (ORA-244) was secured by entrepreneurs from 300 km-distant sources in the desert to make jasper bifaces near the coast. They use chemical and physical properties of the jasper to show that it is derived from local stream beds; no desert connection needs to be invoked. As noted above, a Middle period site near Newport Bay was the site of in- tensive housepit investigations by Grenda et al. (1998). Large portions of four structures were excavated, generating low artifact counts. The site was primarily occupied seasonally from 300 BC to AD 600. Settlement changes through these</page><page sequence="27">The Archaeology of California 27 900 years were stimulated by oscillating climatic conditions. Major villages were absent in this vicinity during the Middle period, and no signs of status differentia- tion are present (Grenda et al.y 1998, p. 250). Three or fewer houses (of 1 1) were occupied at a time, and site population did not exceed 20. Grenda et al. (1998, pp. 238-241) argue correctly on the basis of this site that we should not infer "sedentism" from the mere presence of houses. Researchers on the south coast are seeking to develop an independent bead chronology for the autonomous cultures in the region (separate from the oft-cited Chumash sequence developed by King (1990)). AMS dating of shell beads and ornaments from a southern Gabrielino site is contributing to that effort (Gibson and Koerper, 2000). Efforts to date the development of the circular shell fishhook in the region are also important, particularly because many researchers believe that this technological innovation may be related to increasing dietary dependence on fishing. Koerper et al. (1995) note that there are widely disparate views on the date of the circular hook, ranging from about 1500 to 50 BC, but Martz and Rosenthal (2001) recently contended that such hooks appeared by 2500 BC on SNI. Koerper has secured an AMS fishhook date of c. 50 BC. Careful evaluation of these divergent claims depends on more AMS dating of hooks. In coastal Los Angeles, Altschul et al. (in press) identify cultural connections to the desert interior and directly link these patterns to a Shoshonean migration to the coast. They find evidence in projectile point types, burial practices (crema- tion), and subsistence organization for a roughly 1 000 BC presence of Shoshonean culture bearers (possibly ancestors of the Historic Gabrielino) at the Ballona wet- lands of Los Angeles. Throughout the Middle period (locally defined as c. 1000 BC-AD 1000), these people seem to have had much closer ties to the desert than to their Chumash or southern neighbors. Altschul et al. (in press) suggest that there were several Shoshonean incursions into the coastal area. An AD 500 date is used by some scholars for the initial Shoshonean migration because of the rapid spread of the bow and arrow at that time. However, those who interpret Olivella grooved rectangle beads and other indicators of a "southern interaction sphere" linking the interior and the southern Channel Islands as Shoshonean cultural phe- nomena (rather than just a trade system) think the migrations might have started by 5000 years ago. In any case, there are fascinating research possibilities associated with these several millennia of powerful desert-coast connections. The estuary resources at Ballona might have been worth staying close to and defending by 1000 BC, when 10 seasonal settlements sprang up near the wetlands. This era was followed by a Late period population decline. Altschul et al. (in press) speculate that the Ballona people may have been threatened by more powerful polities to the north and south. For the Santa Monica Mountains area, spanning the Chumash/Gabrielino cultural boundary, baseline data (rosters of sites, locations, and contents) detail the Middle Holocene prehistory (Gamble and King, 1997). Several large permanent villages</page><page sequence="28">28 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon dotted this area during the Middle and Late periods (Green, 1999; King, 1990; Martz, 1 992; McLendon and Johnson, 1 999). For a recent discussion of Gabrielino cultural history, see McCawley (1996). Santa Barbara Channel (South Central Coast and Northern Channel Islands) The Chumash of the Santa Barbara Channel area have attracted a great deal of scholarly attention. As Holmes and Johnson ( 1 998) show, roughly 600 publications on Chumash archaeology, 40 on physical anthropology, 25 on the contact era, 60 on linguistics, 100 on rock art, and 330 on ethnology-ethnohistory predate the late 1990s, and many others have appeared since. Here, we only scrape the surface with a discussion of selected recent contributions; we do not duplicate the rich Chumash material presented in topical discussions above (regarding peopling of the coasts, paleoclimate, political complexity, exchange, gender, and rock art). Using data from the Franciscan Missions and other historical sources, McLendon and Johnson (1999) provide detailed assessments of contact-era Chumash villages, population and social histories, sociopolitical groupings, and genealogical relationships in the northern Channel Islands and along the south- eastern Chumash border. They also discuss village locations in these regions, as do (for the islands) Arnold (1990a) and Kennett et al. (2000). These studies are important for establishing a baseline of contemporary, interacting communities of known sizes, anchored on the landscape, and dating to c. 1780 (just before rad- ical cultural disruptions). They are invaluable in reconstructions of sociopolitics, exchange systems, settlement, and occupational specializations. The Island Chumash of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel islands were among the most occupationally specialized hunter-gatherers in the world; in this sense they were quite different from their counterparts in places like the North- west Coast, where archaeologists have thus far found little evidence of formal, large-scale craft specialization. Specialization took the form of massive produc- tion of chert microliths used to drill shell beads (Arnold, 1987; Arnold et ai, 2001; Preziosi, 2001) and shell beads themselves (Arnold, 1992b; Arnold and Graesch, 2001; Arnold and Munns, 1994; Hollimon, 1990). Many millions of microdrills and beads were manufactured by islanders at roughly 15 large, permanent vil- lages on Santa Cruz and neighboring islands during the Transitional through early Historic periods (AD 1150-1800) (Arnold, 2001b; Arnold and Graesch, 2001; Kennett, 1998). Finished shell beads were exported to the mainland Chumash in exchange for mainland foods and products. Those with the special skills, rights, and knowledge to construct the prized Chumash plank canoes were formal occu- pational specialists as well (based on extensive ethnographic data), but we have little direct archaeological evidence of the specialized production of canoes thus</page><page sequence="29">The Archaeology of California 29 far (Arnold, 1995a). Discussions of plank canoe form and uses highlight its excep- tional importance in local lifeways and politics (Arnold, 1995a, 2000b, 2001a,b; Bernard, 2002). Other possible specializations with archaeological manifestations may include mortar and pestle making on San Miguel Island in the later Middle period (Conlee, 2000). The data are currently limited, and it is not yet clear whether this was a formal specialization. Extensive discussions about California shell beads by Gibson (1992), King (1990), Bennyhoff and Hughes (1987), and others show just how important these commodities were - some used as currency and many others for signaling status and wealth - in these traditional societies. Thus for the Chumash region, their virtu- ally exclusive manufacture on a rather grand scale on the islands over a six-century period was quite important in shaping local Chumash sociopolitics (Arnold, 1992a, 2001a; Munns and Arnold, 2002). Shell beads were of course made in areas beyond Chumash territory and were used in other regional social systems, but within the broader Chumash region very little "counterfeiting" seems to have occurred on the mainland after AD 1200. The occasional small-scale exception at mainland sites near Santa Barbara (e.g., SB A- 1 582 or SB A- 1731) helps prove the rule (Erlandson, 1988; see Arnold and Graesch, 2001, pp. 74-75). Kennett (1998) uses a behavioral ecology approach to northern Channel Islands Middle and Late period settlement and subsistence, examining seasonal mobility, intensity of fishing, violence, and trade as strategies to deal with environ- mental and social stresses. He synthesizes previous island research and uses GIS to trace long-term changes, adding new survey and test results and isotopically based paleoclimatic data from Santa Rosa Island. Major changes such as trends toward more permanent settlement, slightly more bead production, and more fishing be- gan to occur after AD 700, but the development of large villages, a rapid increase in fishing, and an "exponential" intensification of the production of craft items (e.g., beads and microliths) became well established only at AD 1 200-1 300, in the Transitional period (Kennett, 1998, pp. 320-336). These results align well with Arnold's (1992a, 2001a) data from Santa Cruz Island (discussed above). Kennett 's (1998, pp. 373-378) inferences about specialized production for exchange during the Middle period may be on less firm ground, since current evidence from the Mid- dle period points to small-scale production of goods such as microliths and beads at a wide range of settlements for localized use (Arnold, 1987). Clearly, however, further research is called for on the important questions Kennett raises regarding stress, conflict, and the nature of trade in the Chumash area in the climatically and socially volatile centuries leading up to the Transitional period (AD 700-1 150). King (1990) established the cultural chronology for the Chumash area, basing his findings on an extensive analysis of artifacts in grave lots. His accounting of Chumash cultural evolution is gradualistic and adaptationist (Raab, 2000, p. 17). Other examinations of Chumash cultural evolution in recent years have focused on residential data (e.g., households, craft specialization, exchange systems; Arnold,</page><page sequence="30">50 Arnold, Walsh, and HoUimon 1992a, 2001a,b,c; Kennett, 1998; Kennett and Kennett, 2000) and emphasize the punctuated nature of the region's later sociopolitical and economic evolution. De- bates have arisen about the degree to which "status" and "complexity" can be clearly detected with mortuary data (Martz, 1992), especially poorly preserved and curated collections (e.g., Gamble et al., 2001) in a region where the complexi- ties of the mourning ceremony greatly muddled the relationship between property held by individuals and what was buried with them (Arnold and Green, 2002). Since so much property was destroyed in mourning ceremonies, or was inherited, and because surviving relatives routinely placed their contributions of property into the graves, we must conclude that political status, wealth, and even special- ized occupations were obscured in many graves. Commoners' possessions were routinely burned, not interred (Hollimon, 2001). The tools of specialists in graves were possibly contributions from mourners - we simply do not know. At the same time, it is likely that some statuses such as chief or shaman may be reflected in grave treatments. Such people were important enough to warrant (in all probability) some form(s) of mortuary practice that the average person did not enjoy. As noted earlier, the Early Holocene is well represented by important ancient sites such as Arlington Springs, Daisy Cave, and others on the mainland coast and northern islands. The Middle Holocene has been summarized by Glassow (1997b) and Erlandson (1997a). Glassow examines population curves, settlement patterns, diet, and technology for the Santa Barbara Channel region. He reviews the advent of mortar and pestle use and discusses cycles of population in rela- tion to climatic conditions. In his discussion of the western Santa Barbara coast, Erlandson (1997b) suggests that Middle Holocene populations reflect adaptive di- versity, exhibiting more seasonal mobility and no greater population densities than found there during the Early Holocene. At least one site near the Goleta Slough is a Millingstone site with ample evidence for fishing in estuary, nearshore, and kelp bed habitats, broadening our understanding of Millingstone adaptations in this re- gion (Colten, 1991). The Goleta Slough consistently supported bay/estuary/sandy bottom fishing during the Early and Middle Holocene, in stark contrast to Late period faunas dominated by pelagic and midwater fish species that were captured after oceangoing plank boats became available (Rick and Glassow, 1999). A series of contract projects at Vandenberg Air Force Base (north of Point Conception) during the 1970s-1980s increased our understanding of the northern Chumash. Glassow (1996, 2002) discusses sites dating from 9000 BP to the His- toric period, tracing evolving subsistence strategies, paleoclimatic changes, and population growth. The Purisimeño Chumash were more mobile, less populous, and less politically complex than the Santa Barbara Channel-northern Channel Islands Chumash. Vandenberg is particularly well known for its abundant Mon- terey chert resources; Bamforth ( 1 99 1 ) examines the links between human mobility and tool-making practices, finding that people adopted a complex mix of strate- gies in the chert-rich areas of Vandenberg. Arnold (1992c, pp. 125-129) focuses</page><page sequence="31">The Archaeology of California 31 on biface preform production, concluding that despite the large number of pre- forms produced at Vandenberg, preform makers were not occupational specialists in the formal sense of the term. But biface manufacturing was certainly an activity of substantial regional importance in all periods, as Glassow (1996) documents (see also Woodman et al., 1991); the Vandenberg sources were among the most important quarries on the entire California coast. Preform production may have declined in importance when the adoption of small projectile points (associated with the bow and arrow) allowed effective exploitation of lesser lithic sources, but even in that era (post- AD 500) some distinctive Vandenberg chert bifaces wound up at sites as far away as the Channel Islands. If bifaces represented tools of social negotiation in an era when local sources could satisfy raw material needs, then both islanders and Purisimeño Chumash populations north of Point Conception were part of a broad, pan-Chumash network of social exchange throughout later prehistory (Arnold, 1990b; Pletka, 2001a). The Central Coast The central coast archaeological zone corresponds to the Salinan-Esselen- southem Ohlone culture areas, extending from the northern Chumash border to roughly Monterey Bay and including the dramatic Big Sur coast. Jones and his colleagues have used abundant new central coast data as a forum to explore the wider implications of climatic changes, dietary breadth and optimal foraging, early coastal occupations, and exchange, as discussed earlier. Here we highlight other new contributions. The Big Sur coast and the coast mountain ranges were under- explored until the mid-1980s. So little was known that leading scholars (Robert Heizer, Bert Gerow, David Fredrickson) were involved in speculative debates about whether the area had closer cultural ties to the Santa Barbara Channel or San Francisco Bay area or had its own distinctive character (Jones, 1993). Since then, extensive survey work and several large excavation projects have revealed a 12,000-year span of sites (see discussion of Cross Creek, above), early Milling- stone assemblages, shifting settlement strategies, and climate-induced migrations (Fitzgerald and Jones, 1999; Jones, 1993, 1996, 2001, 2002; Jones et aL9 1999, 2002). Jones (1993) provides a comprehensive summary of the earlier CRM litera- ture, radiocarbon dates, and artifact typologies. Clear distinctions have emerged in the fauna exploited at open-coast sites (e.g., near Big Sur) and at estuary areas like Morro Bay and Elkhorn Slough (Gobalet and Jones, 1995). Hildebrandt (1997a) and Jones (1997) have debated the importance of estuary resources at Elkhorn. Hildebrandt suggests that estuary resources were used rather intensively by people throughout the area until reduced mobility after 500 BC (due to population growth and territorial circumscription) forced groups to rely more heavily on nearby lacus- trine foods rather than distant esruarine species. Jones (1997) argues that Elkhorn</page><page sequence="32">32 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon was in fact not very productive in the earlier periods and played a rather minor role in local subsistence. Jones and Jones (1992) discuss a Middle period site near Elkhorn that proved pivotal in reconstructing central coast cultural history. North of Morro Bay, at the site of Little Pico Creek, Jones and Waugh ( 1 995 ) show that Middle period settlement along this section of the coast was clearly marked by an increasing reliance on fishing. An abrupt decline in the use of the coast followed during the Transitional period (AD 1000-1250), and the area was virtually abandoned during the Late period. People evidently moved inland due to limited potential for further marine intensification. Jones (2002, p. 232) and others discuss how none of the political complexity or craft specialization that developed in the Santa Barbara Channel region emerged on the central coast. Jones and Waugh (1995; Jones, 2002) make a strong effort to create independent evaluations of the central coast data, but comparisons to the Santa Barbara region (and critiques of models and theories advanced for that area) still dominated the discussion in the mid-1990s. Several recent CRM publications from the central coast rehash this rhetoric, but by now sufficient local data have emerged that researchers can dispense with boilerplate comparisons to the Chumash and evaluate very interesting central coast developments on their own terms. San Francisco Bay Area San Francisco Bay Area archaeology is dominated by attention to large shell mounds that ring the bay and immediate estuarine interior, but the focus has evolved from seriation-based culture history to interest in the larger political landscape (Bocek, 1991; Broughton, 1999; Lightfoot, 1993, 1997b, p. 139; Lightfoot and Luby, 2002). Moratto ( 1 984, pp. 2 1 7-283) provides a survey of earlier archaeolog- ical work on these mounds - of which some 425 were recorded by Nelson (1909). Several have been "revisited" in recent years and subjected to reanalysis of curated materials or to limited additional excavation. These include Emeryville ( ALA-309: Broughton, 1994a, 1997, 1999, 2001; Zogg, 1998), West Berkeley (ALA-307: In- gram, 1998), Ryan (ALA-329: Wilson, 1993), and Patterson/Newark/Coyote Hills mounds (ALA- 12, -13, -328: Harlan, 1996; Wilson, 1999). New mound sites are rarely discovered but may exist deeply buried beneath San Francisco high rises (Hattori and Pastron, 1993). Nelson's (1906) manuscript detailing his initial work at Emeryville has been edited by Broughton (1996), and Kowta (2000) suggests that those early excavations were instrumental to the development of stratigraphie techniques in the New World. Previously excavated deposits from Emeryville were recently reexamined, revealing large quantities of artifacts and bone (report pending). The shoreline of the bay is perhaps the most intensively studied archae- ological tract in California, and the historic significance of the Emeryville mound in particular can hardly be overstated.</page><page sequence="33">The Archaeology of California 33 Culture-history studies that long dominated bay area research have been supplanted by two related research theses: that shell mound sites represented sig- nificant landmarks within a larger political landscape and that stress on natural resources significantly impacted the later culture history of the bay. Mound sites were vast accumulations of domestic debris from village life carried out over hundreds or thousands of years. Beyond stone and bone tools, ornaments, and ver- tebrate remains, mounds may include residential architecture, lenses of shell and fire-cracked rock, and large numbers of burials (occasionally thousands; Wilson, 1993, p. 2). In addition to this mixture of residential and mortuary features, there is evidence of nonresidential architecture (Leventhal, 1993, p. 244), ritual interment of large birds and mammals (Grady et al., 2001; Pastron, in press), and clusters of charmstones (Wilson, 1993, p. 13), bifaces (Pastron and Walsh, 1989; Wiberg, 1988, p. 23), pipes, and whistles (Harlan, 1996). In all, these findings suggest group-level ceremonial activities. Moreover, fill was hauled to sites, perhaps to augment the visibility of mounds as conspicuous monuments (Leventhal, 1993, p. 142; Lightfoot, 1997b, p. 139). The mounds appear to be deliberate mixtures of the sacred and the profane, of residential space located amid and atop ceremo- nial places. They were likely sociopolitical landmarks within a larger, integrated cultural landscape (Bocek, 1991; Lightfoot, 1993, 1997b, p. 139; Lightfoot and Luby, 2002; Luby and Gruber, 1999). Although the term "chief dom" is consciously avoided, there is clear evidence for aggrandizing behavior suggestive of a "transe - galitarian" social and political system (Luby and Gruber, 1999, pp. 99-100). Chronological frameworks follow the Early-Middle-Late divisions initially proposed in the Central California Taxonomic System (CCTS). Since Beardsley 's (1948, 1954) initial efforts to tie the CCTS to the bay area, there have been at- tempts to refine the chronology into smaller units (Fredrickson, 1994; Milliken and Bennyhoff, 1993, p. 386; Wilson, 1999). The earliest evidence for human occupation of the area is in the form of putatively very old finds - including the BART and Sunnyvale skeletons. We now know that these date to just 5000 years ago. Rising tidal waters and post-Gold Rush sedimentation have obscured most older materials. Indeed, the basal levels of several of the oldest bay mounds are now 6 m below sea level (Broughton, 1999, p. 32), and virtually all other major estuarine environments along the California coast yield significant archaeological materials older than 5000 years (Jones, 1992, p. 4). Thus although the earliest known bay shore mounds date to 3800 years ago, it is difficult to generalize for the time frame in view of the obvious sample bias. All but a very few of the earliest bay area sites are well inland (e.g., Fitzgerald, 1993; Jones, 1991). Perhaps for this reason, the Early period (e. 300O-500 BC) is generally characterized as terrestrial (i.e., nonmarine) in subsistence focus. Basgall (1987) has suggested that the acorn first emerged as a California staple at about 2000 BC in the bay area. Many bay area mounds were in use by 500 BC (Broughton, 1999, p. 32; Jones, 1992, p. 12). The Middle period (c. 500 BC-AD 1000) is characterized as</page><page sequence="34">34 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon the "golden age" of shell-mound communities (Lightfoot and Luby, 2002). Mounds were occupied year round and availed both terrestrial and marine resources. There is ample evidence for steady population growth, and the elaboration of certain features (especially burials) suggests emerging differences in wealth and/or status at the individual and intersite levels. Interpersonal violence may have peaked during the Middle period (Keeley, 1996, p. 91 ), including trophy taking (Lambert, 2002, p. 216; Wiberg, 1988, p. 22). In the Ute period (e. AD KXXM700) the number of new sites decreased and many of the large Middle period mounds were abandoned. At the same time, there was a profusion of sites farther inland (Jones, 1992, p. 1 3). Thus while regional population growth is apparent, the bay perimeter probably saw steady population decline from about AD 1000 on. Late period population decrease coincided with change in the availability of certain key food resources. Two studies suggest that humans contributed to lo- cal depletions. Simons (1992) focuses on mammalian remains for 11 bay area mounds spanning all periods. He notes a bay-wide shift in emphasis from ter- restrial mammals (Early and Middle periods) to marine mammals (Late period), arguing for a decline in hunting efficiency rather than an intentional shift in prey emphasis. Although he does not discount the effect that changing local conditions may have had on selected mammal populations, he suggests that overhunting was a significant factor (Simons, 1992, p. 88; see also Hildebrandt and Jones, 1992, p. 383). Broughton (1994a, 1997, 1999, 2001) focuses on vertebrate fauna from the Emeryville mound and argues that local depletions were not due to climate or technological change. He finds evidence for a Middle period decline in "preferred" terrestrial species, the increased use of "expensive" marine mammals, and across- the-board declines in the body sizes of both terrestrial and marine animals, each of which suggests ovenexploitation (Broughton, 1999, pp. 55-57, 65-66, 69; see also Zogg, 1998). He further finds an unexpected response: a resurgence in the primacy of terrestrial mammals during the Late period (Broughton, 1999, pp. 54, 69). But for some time, at least, bay area resources were seriously depleted, and people shifted to previously underexploited inland resource patches. These patches may have included intertribal "buffer-zones" and were exploited despite increased transportation costs and the attendant risk of conflict. Study of settlement dynamics requires intensive investigations in regions abutting the bay, and interest in the interior has grown in part due to investigations mandated by state, federal, and local CRM laws. Although much of this work remains in the gray literature, unpublished manuscripts are summarized and cited in a growing body of published papers (e.g., Elsasser, 1986; Fitzgerald, 1993; Fitzgerald and Jones, 1999; Grady et aLy 2001; Hildebrandt, 1997a,b; Hylkema, 2002; Jones, 1997; Lightfoot, 1997b; Parkman, 1986, 1988, 1994a; Pastron, in press; Wiberg, 1996, 1997). The greater bay area was of course never abandoned. A recent vital inter- est in Costanoan-Ohlone ethnohistory and ethnography is yielding archaeological</page><page sequence="35">The Archaeology of California 35 rewards (Bean, 1994; Bocek, 1984; Milliken, 1987, 1991, 1995; Shoup and Milliken, 1 999; see also Teixeira, 1 997). Yet local historic and ethnographic records contain no material analogues to the immense shell mounds that once dotted the bay nor sociological analogues to the complex political arrangements many scholars now believe these to suggest. Northern California Northern California consists of several subregions (North Coast, Cascade Range, Modoc Plateau, Sacramento Valley) distinguished by physiography, sub- sistence, settlement, and ethnolinguistic groups. In the North Coast Ranges paral- leling the Pacific Ocean, many natural resources, including obsidian, are available. The mountains support redwood forests, which receive ample rainfall in the winter and are kept moist by summer fog. In places, the land is rugged with nearly vertical cliffs below narrow terraces. The populous groups of the northern coast and along the banks of the Klamath River and other large river systems have clear affini- ties with the Northwest Coast culture area. The Yurok, Karuk, and Hupa, among others, display similar cultural traits and environmental adaptations despite tremen- dous linguistic diversity. Peoples of this region relied heavily on fish resources, marine and anadromous, which supported large, ranked societies in permanent vil- lages. They maintained short- and long-distance exchange networks (Fredrickson, 1984, p. 473). Largely sedentary, salmon-focused groups on the middle Klamath River, for instance, were engaged in considerable exchange. Chartkoff (1989) evaluates sociopolitical organization in the region and discusses the relationships among labor organization (necessary for harvesting large numbers of anadro- mous fish), settlement hierarchies (religious centers located at the most productive fishing sites), and population growth connected to the exploitation of fish as a staple. To the south, the coasts are less hospitable and the climate a little drier, with periodic summer droughts. Interior plant communities are primarily oak woodland and chaparral. Salmon were not as abundant as in the north, and the people such as the Mattole, Sinkyone, and Coast Yuki (coastal) and the Yuki, Wailaki, and Lassik (interior) had more diversified economies. To maximize seasonal fish runs, cooperative labor from entire villages was required to construct weirs and process fish for immediate consumption and later storage. Based on linguistic, morpho- logical, and archaeological evidence, the Yuki were among the earliest inhabitants of California (Fredrickson, 1984). In the southern North Coast area, the Russian River and Clear Lake were home to several groups of Porno; others in the region included the Coast Miwok and Wappo. The interior includes significant marsh resources as well as oak wood- lands. Abundant natural resources enabled population growth and aggregation in</page><page sequence="36">36 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon some areas; larger communities were tribelets, each nominally under the authority of a headperson and politically autonomous from other sociopolitical units. The precise nature of Porno political organization is not entirely clear, but Pomoans are frequently cited in models of emerging complexity. The Sacramento Valley and northern Sierra foothills supported a number of groups, including the Patwin, Maidu, Nomlaki, and Wintu. Diverse resources included acorns and salmon. Winter villages could contain as many as several hun- dred persons, and the form of sociopolitical organization was the tribelet (Basgall and Hildebrandt, 1989). A dietary emphasis on storable seeds and nuts was re- flected in considerable labor investments in bedrock mortars and granaries, found in large villages along with family dwellings, sweathouses, and a communal cere- monial structure. Extensive trans-Sierran trade networks moved material, people, and ideas over large territories and among tribelets (Moratto, 1984, pp. 289-291). North of the valley are the Cascade Range and Modoc Plateau. Adaptations in this area consisted of tribelets centered around large lakes. The native peoples include the Shastans, northern Yana, Achomawi, and Atsugewi. The Shastans traded ob- sidian to the Yurok, Karuk, and Hupa for subsistence goods and shell beads (Raven, 1984, pp. 435-438). Many recent archaeological investigations in northwestern California are CRM projects (Jones and Hayes, 1993). Preservation biases influencing site de- position and accessibility have resulted in relatively few large-scale or long-term archaeological projects leading to peer-reviewed publications. Their limited ac- cessibility notwithstanding, many of these reports are among the most important sources available (see Fitzgerald and Jones, 1999). Layton (1990) provides a syn- thesis of Porno sites and the archaeological evidence for prehistoric and contact-era population movements among the Northern Porno. The linguistically based model of Northern Porno prehistory is supported by specialized analyses, including ob- sidian hydration, site catchment, and radiocarbon dating. Layton proposes that the next step in Porno archaeology will involve processual questions about social relations. For instance, because the Porno may have displaced Yukian groups west of the Russian River, we need to ask why and how this took place (Layton, 1990, p. 62). A festschrift for David Fredrickson (White et ai, 1993) and the Franklin Fenenga memorial volume (Wallace and Riddell, 2002) include significant at- tention to the archaeology of northern California. Another collection of essays addresses recent obsidian studies (Hughes, 1990; see also Fredrickson and Origer, 2002). Much of this work deals with northwestern California, especially the North Coast Ranges (e.g., Basgall, 1993a; Fredrickson and White, 1988; Hildebrandt and Hayes, 1993). Many scholars employ ethnographic and ethnohistorical informa- tion to interpret their archaeological data. Riddell (1993) considers the relation- ships among household and village sizes, spatial distribution, and function in sev- eral archaeological sites ancestral to Maidu-area villages. Riddell interprets some</page><page sequence="37">The Archaeology of California 37 structures as semisubterranean earth-covered lodges that may have functioned in political and religious activities. The presence or absence of these structures in particular villages suggests a system of political-religious centers with satellite vil- lages whose inhabitants attended activities in "capital" villages. Riddell ( 1 993) also suggests that some of the larger houses were the homes of village leaders and their families. Several authors address the intensified exploitation of various resources (Bouey, 1 987) including acorns (Basgall, 1 987), other nuts and seeds (Wohlgemuth, 1 996), and marine and terrestrial mammals (Broughton, 1 994b; Hildebrandt, 1 984; Hildebrandt and Jones, 1992; Hildebrandt and Levulett, 1997, 2002; Lyman et al., 1988; Wake and Simons, 2000). These studies lend support to notions that some prehistoric subsistence economies in northern California were essentially "proto- agricultural" systems (Basgall, 1987; Wohlgemuth, 1996) and that resource man- agement was significant (e.g., burning, plant tending; see Weigel, 1993). White's (2002) work in the Clear Lake area is a departure and challenge to many of the common precepts of intensification theory. White proposes that com- plex organization is a necessary precondition for population increase and resource intensification, rather than the reverse. He also argues that archaeologists' ability to evaluate assumptions about early economic change have been hindered by a lack of direct floral and faunal evidence. Instead, researchers have relied on indirect evidence (lithic toolkits) for all but the most recent sites. White's work at Clear Lake involves extensive geoarchaeological exploration to sample well-preserved buried sites. These deposits produced rich seed and bone assemblages as old as 9000 years. The intensive use of acorns began at least 7000 years ago, together with small fish, seeds, and other resources thought to post-date "late intensification." Challenging conventional wisdom, White and colleagues show that the intensive use of acorns was associated with nearly exclusive use of manos and metates from 7000 to 2000 BP. Thus mortar and pestle technology was not necessary to process acorns, and assumptions about subsistence resource use need to be evaluated with direct evidence in concert with inferences from processing/procuring technologies. Wake and Simons (2000) examine faunal remains from the Duncans Point site on the Sonoma coast, one of the oldest sites in northern California (c. 8200 BP), and conclude that various natural changes, rather than expanding diet breadth or intensification, account for evolving resource use at this site. Another significant research focus is the exploitation of marine mammals and associated technologies. Northern groups apparently did not develop much emphasis on marine mammal hunting, and several regional point types were mis- takenly interpreted as sea mammal "harpoon tips" in past analyses (Lyman et al, 1988). Hildebrandt and Jones (1992) employ optimal foraging theory to analyze marine-oriented subsistence and settlement on the coasts of Oregon and California. They also discuss the role played by the development of technologies in increasing organizational complexity. They infer that oceangoing watercraft were necessary</page><page sequence="38">38 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon precursors to sociopolitical complexity. Hildebrandt and Levulett (2002) discuss the archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence for marine mammal hunting from 20 northern sites, concluding that boating technology included seaworthy craft (not merely dugout canoes) in some ways analogous to the plank canoes of south- ern California. They also examine socioeconomic complexity, labor organization linked with the boating technology, and burial goods in the graves of adults and children, concluding that some of these societies were characterized by ranking and inherited wealth. In addition they provide tentative support for a diffusionist model of settlement and language distribution along the coasts and riverbanks, challenging Gmoser's (1993) interpretation that the Wiyot and Yurok languages should be seen as isolates with great time depth in the area. In the 1990s, the relationship between prehistoric population movements and linguistic distribution reemerged as an issue in California archaeology. The "patch- work map" of California language boundaries at the start of the twentieth century has long plagued archaeologists who wish to understand the distribution of ethnic groups, the meanings of artifact "styles," and the nature of cultural interactions. The north exhibited tremendous linguistic diversity at the time of European contact (Fig. 1), likely the result of considerable population movement throughout prehis- tory. Archaeologists working in northern California continue to grapple with these research issues (e.g., Gmoser, 1993; Hughes, 1992; Jackson, 1989; Layton, 1990; Silliman, 1996). Lightfoot and Martinez (1995) address the topic of native group boundary construction and its impact on the archaeology of northern California. Lightfoot (1996) describes the theoretical and methodological bases for boundary studies (including a reliance on obsidian sourcing). He discusses material correlates of boundaries, the nature of style and information exchange, and three issues for fu- ture research: (1) scales of analysis, (2) the complex social dynamics of boundary zones, and (3) how different kinds of boundaries and boundary processes may be observed in archaeological contexts. Fredrickson (1996) describes the theoretical and practical considerations of using obsidian sourcing as a method of delineating prehistoric boundaries (see also Layton, 1990, p. 3). He elaborates on Lightfoot 's points by examining "tribelet" social organization, introduced by Kroeber in 1925 as the quintessential form of organization in California. Fredrickson discusses the relationship between the tribelet (or village community) and well-defined territo- ries and how these might be visible in the archaeological record. His is an important reminder to archaeologists that language does not equal ethnicity, ethnicity may not be reflected in artifact styles, and the forms of social interaction in precontact California were undoubtedly complex. Referring to the emergence of complex organization, Fredrickson (1996, p. 26) notes that "central administration implies the inherent conflict between different levels of administration: the extended fam- ily, the larger kin group, and the tribelet; California archaeologists have not yet addressed this level of interaction."</page><page sequence="39">The Archaeology of California 39 For the North Coast Ranges, these issues are now beginning to be addressed. Dowdall (2002) employs obsidian sourcing to examine prehistoric interaction spheres on the coast. Using principles derived from cultural geography, she identi- fies four interaction zones and suggests that social and exchange ties were strongest between coastal people and those who brought them Napa or Anadel obsidian (rather than other obsidian types). Dowdall also discusses the chronology and subsistence-settlement system through 4000 years of prehistory on the coast, oc- cupied during the Historic period by Pomoans (north) and the Coast Miwok (south). The southern people apparently moved into the area from the San Francisco Bay at about 500 BC. Lightfoot (1992) examines whether the rocky coast could sup- port large and locally dense populations. Although one model of coastal foraging productivity would predict only small, highly mobile hunter-gatherer-fisher pop- ulations, Lightfoot concludes that the environment could support high population densities in and around central "villages." Many rock art studies in northern California employ substantial ethnographic information and place the art within larger cosmological and religious frameworks (on the Porno: Parkman, 1993a,b, 1994b, 1996; on the Klamath and Modoc: Foster and Foster, 2002; Haynal, 2000). A particularly intriguing discussion is Conkey's (2001) review of the diverse "meanings" of art among hunting and gathering peoples. She employs a comparative approach using worldwide data and includes the Porno, Yurok, Hupa, and other peoples of northern California. Several papers focused on gender issues and California have appeared, as dis- cussed earlier. A few of these focus on northern groups, including the contact-era study of Martinez (1998) and an analysis by Farris (1992) on the use of pine nut beads as a medium of exchange among women in northern California and adjacent areas of Oregon and Nevada. Interpretations of ethnographic data with regard to gender have important implications for archaeological analyses of nonegalitarian societies. Lesure (1998) evaluates Jane Collier's models of the constitution of in- equality in kin-based societies. His analysis of the Yurok ethnographic record does not support the thesis that degrees of social inequality are determined by the na- ture of the relationship between husbands and their wives' kin. Collier posited that marriage is the central institution that distributes privileges and obligations among people and that marital instability is a driving force behind inequality. Lesure dis- cusses gender relations, kinship, and labor appropriation within the larger context of Yurok cosmology and symbolism. This analysis makes a fine companion piece to a study of Yurok women and traditional menstruation practices by Buckley (1988). He challenges the reader to amend facile, ethnocentric, and stereotypical notions of "pollution" that have too often been applied to the menstrual practices of indigenous cultures. He makes compelling arguments about the positive views of menstruation among Yurok women as well as larger contextual interpretations that influence our understanding of Yurok social organization, household struc- ture and composition, and ritual expressions. Buckley (1988, p. 1 87) demonstrates</page><page sequence="40">40 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon that the analysis of California ethnographies may generate "hypotheses of sig- nificance to general theory regarding hunter-gatherers far beyond the confines of.. .California." Recent studies employing contact-era data from northern California have the- oretical and methodological implications for archaeologists worldwide. Lightfoot (1995) addresses the arbitrary distinction between prehistoric and histor- ical archaeology in the United States. He advocates an archaeology of pluralism and illustrates the complexity of encounters between European colonialists and indigenous peoples. Colonizing Europeans were from diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, and the peoples they encountered in North America were equally if not more diverse. Such cultural heterogeneity presents archaeologists with complicated interpretive challenges. The multiethnic community of Fort Ross, a Russian mercantile colony in Porno lands on the northern coast, is an example. The study of the local Kashia (Kashaya) Porno and conscripted Aleutians from Alaska who lived at the fort is traditionally the realm of prehistoric archaeolo- gists, regardless of the time period of the sites. The deposits associated with the mercantile operation and colonial living quarters are typically the domain of his- torical archaeologists. Lightfoot and colleagues dispense with these unproductive divisions, conjoining ethnohistorical and ethnographic information, long-term cul- ture change, and pan-regional comparisons in well-integrated studies of cultural persistence and change at Fort Ross (Lightfoot et al., 1991, 1997, 1998). Lightfoot and Simmons (1998) analyze initial encounters (AD 1542-1603) between native Califomians and European voyagers. The nature of these contacts resulted in diverse responses structured by ethnicity, gender, age, and social status. The timing of encounters with regard to indigenous and Christian ceremonial cycles also was critical in their outcomes. Lightfoot and Simmons focus on encounters and exchange relations, including those initiated by native peoples, discussed in the voyagers* chronicles (e.g., contact-era exchange at Drake's Bay north of San Francisco). The varying responses of Califomians and Europeans were a function of myriad ideologies, ceremonial practices, gift giving, and meanings of material culture. Lightfoot and Simmons also consider the impact of European diseases in coastal California, suggesting that native-voyager encounters resulted in epidemics that were geographically limited, sporadic, and short-lived. Ishi, the last so-called "wild Indian" in North America, walked into a ranch slaughterhouse in a town north of Sacramento in 191 1. He was starving, did not speak a language intelligible to any non-Indian, and became famous - immortalized in a series of scholarly and popular publications - by virtue of his ethnological and linguistic work with Alfred and Theodora Kroeber and their colleagues. Touted as the "last of his tribe" (the Yahi band of the Yana), Ishi has become a controversial figure in the history of California anthropology. His treatment by Kroeber and the anthropological establishment has been reviewed closely with regard to ethics, principally generated by the discovery of Ishi's brain, which was shipped east</page><page sequence="41">The Archaeology of California 4 1 after his death and found during the 1990s in the collections of the Smithsonian (Rockafellar and Starn, 1999). Among other things, Ishi was asked to make many projectile points during his residence in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park at the Museum of Anthropology. Shackley's (2000) analysis of the style of these points indicates that after some 1000 years of local cultural stress, an amalgamated cul- ture evolved in parts of north-central California during the 1800s. Ishi 's biological ancestry was apparently Wintu-Nomlaki-Yahi, but he made points in the Wintu- Nomlaki style and lived as a Yahi until he was the only survivor. Shackley's study has important implications for our broader understanding of style and ethnicity. The San Joaquín Valley and Sierra Nevada Foothills The Central California Taxonomic System (CCTS) has influenced many scholarly developments in the Sacramento Delta and the San Joaquin and Sacra- mento valleys (together known as the Central Valley). Significant essays on the CCTS by James Bennyhoff and David Fredrickson (written over the last 30 years and revised into the 1990s) were recently published (Hughes, 1994). Most current projects in central California, including the San Joaquin Valley and western Sierra Nevada foothills, draw extensively on the findings of the vast New Melones Archae- ological Project (NMAP) (Moratto, 2002; Moratto et al., 1988). Based around New Melones Reservoir in the Sierra foothills, NMAP recorded and/or assessed nearly 300 prehistoric (and historic Indian) sites, of which 68 were subjected to subsurface testing. The sites reveal a temporal sequence from 8000 years ago to the historic era. Of particular consequence are the suggestions that the region was subject to varying occupation intensities over time and that artifact assemblages and other factors (including mortuary practices) indicate cultural discontinuities. Among the findings is a thinly distributed population at AD 500-1300, followed immediately by a rapid upsurge in regional population. This wave of immigrants - beginning at AD 1300 - features a material culture assemblage that closely resembles the ethnographic Interior Miwok (Moratto, 2002, pp. 42-43). Broughton (1994b) examines faunal remains from sites in the northern San Joaquin Valley and Delta regions. He finds evidence for harvest pressure on fish and game from about 4000 years ago through the historic era and evidence of year-round occupation at large delta villages. In combination, these data support models of population growth and increasingly intensive exploitation of circum- scribed territories for central California after about 4000 BP (see also Basgall, 1987; Beaton, 1991). Despite the suggestion of diminished social territories, the valleys and nearby Sierra foothills were visited seasonally by one and the same people (Chartkoff, 1990). This notion, in part, has fostered important studies of presumed "special purpose" sites, among the most ubiquitous of which is the bedrock milling (BRM) station. Jackson (1991) has established the implications of BRM sites for gender studies (see above discussion), although the application</page><page sequence="42">42 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon of his findings to earlier time frames (Early Millingstone) has been questioned (McGuire and Hildebrandt, 1994). Focused interest in Early Millingstone sites in the Central Valley has revealed commonalities with the better-known expressions of the adaptation in southern California (Fitzgerald and Jones, 1999; McGuire, 1995). However, Millingstone sites in the foothills yield more projectile points than contemporary valley sites (Fredrickson, 1997, p. 295), implying functional - perhaps seasonal - differences not clearly recognized in southern California. In the Yosemite National Park region of the Sierra Nevada, questions have been raised about periods identified through artifact (e.g., projectile point) se- riation. Based on obsidian hydration, type-styles do not appear (or disappear) as abruptly and discretely as our chronological periodizations would have it (Rondeau, 1999). This begs important questions concerning the meaning of "transition" peri- ods, including whether these are the consequence of overlapping cultural groups, overlapping functional applications for certain artifacts, or simply coarse-grained cross-dating. Given large obsidian assemblages in Yosemite (mainly from eastern Sierra sources) and a long sequence of occupation, access to multiple dating tech- niques and federally sponsored research make Yosemite a propitious location for exploring these problems. There is considerable antiquity of occupation near Tulare Lake in the south- ern San Joaquín Valley (Wallace and Riddell, 1 99 1 , 1 993). The lake (now drained) has yielded more fluted projectile points (n - 269 and counting) than the rest of the state combined (Dillon, 2002). Lake margins have yielded additional time markers that reveal an unbroken sequence of sites representing the Early Holocene through the Historic era, including points, crescents and eccentrics, charmstones, and beads (Hopkins, 1991; Kimberline, 1995; Seals, 1993; Siefkin, 1995; Wal- lace and Riddell, 1988, pp. 92-98; Wilke, 1991). Bone retrieved from the region includes a wealth of extinct species, including Colombian mammoth, sloth, and Bison antiquus (Fenenga, 1991, p. 12). Unfortunately, most of the artifacts and ancient bone are in private collections (Fenenga, 1991, p. 11; Wallace, 1993a,b) and lack primary contextual data. Excavations are ongoing (Dillon, 2000). The latest time frames are subject to several innovative studies and discoveries, including Hull's (2002) focus on the Protohistoric and Historic eras in Yosemite, where aboriginal lifeways persisted into the 1800s despite demographic upheaval (see also Moskowitz, 1 995). Johnson ( 1 990) describes Protohistoric pottery manu- factured in one part of the lower Sacramento Valley, which he argues persuasively is a local innovation and not (as previously assumed) evidence for long-distance exchange or historic acculturation. In the southern Sierra foothills, Jackson (1990) discusses undecorated Protohistoric brown ware vessel forms that are analogues to known basket forms (see also Wallace, 1990). Presumed functional equivalence of these technologies begs questions of the cultural mechanisms underlying adoption of redundant forms. Significant research potential remains regarding the region's later (Late, Historic) social and political developments, particularly among the</page><page sequence="43">The Archaeology of California 43 populous Yokuts. Generally excellent preservation for architecture and other re- mains and a growing ethnographic and historical literature will prove useful (Lee, 1998; Phillips, 1993; see also Hull, 2002). A significant drawback to future studies in central California is wholesale alteration of the landscape through fanning as well as exposure of many sites to generations of private collectors (Riddell, 2002). Mojave Desert A few large, stratified sites in the harsh Mojave Desert provide the cultural his- tory groundwork for much of the region (Basgall, 1 993b; Gilreath and Hildebrandt, 1997, p. 177; Schroth, 1994; Sutton, 1988, 1996; Yohe, 1992a). Ironically, two of the most prominent such sites - Rose Spring (INY-372) and Stahl (INY-182) - are "borderline" cases, located in the Great Basin-Mojave Desert transition region of the southern Owens Valley (which encompasses Coso, Stahl, and Rose Spring; Fig. 3) (Schroth, 1994, pp. 151-197; Yohe, 1992a). In many respects research in the California desert regions follows trends established in the Great Basin. The regions share some projectile point types and chronologies (but see Bettinger and Eerkens, 1997, 1999), general cultural trends (Sutton, 1994), and arid-lands adap- tations (Fowler, 1995; Warren, 1994). Thus selective borrowing of theoretical and even ethnographic constructs needs no apology, although overly broad "Desert Culture thinking" is precarious (Bettinger, 1993). The earliest time frames remain controversial, even discounting some of the more extravagant claims for mid-Pleistocene occupation of the Mojave (Budinger, 1996; Grayson, 1993, pp. 57-59; Patterson etal.y 1987; Whitley and Dorn, 1993). Pre-Holocene activity is indicated by scattered discoveries of fluted points (Basgall, 1993b; Basgall and Hall, 1991, 1994; Dillon, 2002; Justice, 2002, p. 79; Sutton, 1 996, pp. 227-228; Yohe, 1 992b). Despite invocation of the type name, these do not always appear to be truly Clovis in form; many are only provisionally characterized as "fluted" (Warren and Phagan, 1988, p. 1 29). Typically, basally thinned points are highly weathered surface finds and impossible to date independently. As yet, none have been recovered in firm association with extinct fauna, and so the "Clovis" (and pre-Clovis) expression in the Mojave Desert remains unsettled. It is there but not well defined. Fluted points are occasionally found in Early Holocene (c. 8000-5500 BC) or "Lake Mojave" contexts (Sutton, 1996, pp. 228-229; Willig and Aikens, 1988), raising debate over whether certain fluted points are chronological or functional types (Basgall and Hall, 1991; Warren and Phagan, 1988). Although the Early Holocene traditionally has been associated with extinct lakeshores (e.g., Lake Mojave), these assemblages may simply have their greatest visibility on the ex- tensively surveyed shores. It now appears that Early Holocene materials occur in a variety of environmental contexts (Warren, 1994). Large Lake Mojave</page><page sequence="44">44 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon assemblages may represent recurrent short-term residence over long periods (Basgall, 2000, p. 128). The Middle Holocene (c. 5500-2000 BC, "Pinto pe- riod") shows a continuation - even escalation - of the pattern of multiple episodes of site visitation for limited activities, inferred from fairly narrow tool inven- tories (in stratified sites) or "site furniture," including groundstone, on surface sites. Signs of unrestricted mobility and little competition over untaxed resources are attributed to low population levels (Basgall, 2000, p. 133; Bettinger, 1999, pp. 46-47). At the onset of the Late Holocene (c. 2000 BC-AD 500, "Gypsum period") there was increased reliance on vegetal products and a clear trend toward more dis- persed, nonredundant site locations. Specialized camps suggest an overall increase in logistical subsistence organization (Basgall, 2000, pp. 1 32-1 33; Bettinger, 1 999, p. 48; Warren, 1994). Increasing attention to scheduling was probably compelled by the diminished size of territories - a consequence of growing populations. This development follows the general predictions of the "traveler-processor" model: intensified exploitation of limited holdings, development of caching and storing be- haviors, and territoriality (Bettinger, 1991, pp. 100-103; Bettingerand Baumhoff, 1982). Still later in the Late Holocene (c. AD 500-1900, regionally "Saratoga Springs," "Rose Spring," or "Shoshone" period) there is magnification of the initial Late Holocene pattern, including establishment of relatively large seasonal settle- ments (Basgall, 2000, p. 133). For the Owens Valley, Bettinger (1999, p. 49) notes that groups "operated within annual ranges so small they were made sedentary vir- tually by default." Dramatic differences in overall productive potential of various subrogions of the greater Mojave make sweeping comparisons a risky undertaking (Sutton, 1989), but regional data show general concordance in the trend toward increased population size and increased territoriality. Interregional variability is exemplified in the southwestern Mojave, where Late Holocene sites appear to continue the mid-Holocene pattern of short-term repetitive site use (Hector, 1990; Walsh, 2001, pp. 201-205), likely a consequence of low population levels in parts of the desert. Furthermore, based on analyses of ceramic production for the north- eastern Mojave, Eerkens et ai imply levels of group mobility far higher than that for the Owens Valley area (Eerkens et ö/., 2002a, pp. 215, 220). "Decreased mo- bility" is a relative term; in general the Mojave Desert saw little truly long-term settlement in any period (Eerkens, 1999). The Coso area of the northern Mojave provides a focal point for new directions in rock art studies (Clewlow, 1998, p. 1 1 ; Hildebrandt and McGuire, 2002, pp. 243- 246). In an effort to solve the chronological problems associated with rock art, Dom (1994, 1998) has experimented with both I4C and cation-ratio dating of rock varnish and has begun to understand and control external variables that may affect the samples. Currently, varnish dates for Coso rock art range from 16,500 years ago to AD 700 (Dorn, 1998, p. 80; Whitley and Dorn, 1993). Because many find</page><page sequence="45">The Archaeology of California 45 the earlier dates untenable, the technique continues to foster debate (Bamforth, 1997; Harry, 1995, 1997). An engaging issue in rock art studies concerns interpretation of the meanings of the art elements. There is ethnographic and other inferential evidence to interpret Coso (and other) rock art in terms of the activities of shamans or hunters engaged in ceremonial activities, including trances (Whitley, 1994, 1998a,b, 2000a,b; Whitley et ai, 1999). The ethnographic basis for this suggestion has been questioned (Quinlan 2000a,b), and the interpretation has been criticized as too monolithic, masking an untold variety of equally plausible explanations for the mind set of the artist, who may have been neither hunter nor shaman (Leach, 1999, p. 190; cf. Whitley, 2000c). In any case, the neuropsychological underpinnings of the debate rely strongly on hermeneutic readings of nonrenewable ethnographic sources, and so the issue is not likely to be resolved soon. Debates about the region's projectile point typology center on whether bro- ken and subsequently reworked points of one type may result in formation of - or conflation with - another type (Bettinger et a/., 1991; Flenniken and Raymond, 1986, p. 609; Flenniken and Wilke, 1989). The potential for chronological chaos is high: broken Late Holocene Elko points can be reworked into "Pinto" points nor- mally assigned mid-Holocene dates. The debate has fostered efforts to improve definitions for distinguishing these and other "at risk" point types (Basgall and Hall, 2000; Meighan, 1989; Rondeau, 1996; Schroth, 1994; Vaughn and Warren, 1987; Warren, 2002; see also Odell, 2001, pp. 47-48). A second typological is- sue concerns the chronological parameters for the Rose Spring (Rosegate) point type. These bear a strong similarity to older, larger Elko points (Justice, 2002, pp. 298-330; Yohe, 2000, pp. 213-214), and the chronological division between the two is thought to represent the introduction of the bow and arrow (Bettinger and Eerkens, 1999, pp. 235-236; Yohe, 1992a, 1998, pp. 27-28). Such questions con- cerning point types are doubly significant because, in addition to providing primary chronological data for many sites, point types play a significant role in calibrating obsidian hydration rates (e.g., Gilreath and Hildebrandt, 1997, pp. 1 1-12; Hall and Jackson, 1989). Obsidian is widely used in dating and reconstructing exchange networks (via sourcing), and considerable attention has focused on obsidian from the immense Coso Volcanic Field in the northern Mojave (Ericson, 1989; Gilreath and Hilde- brandt, 1997; Hughes, 1988; Mazer et al., 1991; Stevenson and Sheetz, 1989; Stevenson et ai, 1993). The Coso "source" is actually composed of hundreds of distinct source localities, virtually all of which served as quarries (Gilreath and Hildebrandt, 1997, p. 7). While this greatly complicates development of source- specific hydration rates, a "catch-ail" rate for Coso obsidian is in wide and produc- tive use (Gilreath and Hildebrandt, 1997, p. 16). Non-Coso obsidian is not terribly common in the Mojave and usually derives from eastern Sierran sources farther to the north. Additional sources are in the southern Mojave (Shackley, 1994, 1995,</page><page sequence="46">46 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon pp. 533-534), and even small, scattered sources of obsidian nodules may provide significant materials suitable for tool manufacture (Torres, 1 998). Studies of source locations for other raw materials provide inferences regarding temporal variation in land-use patterns (Bamforth, 1990, 1992) as well as differences in presumed user gender (Walsh, 2000). Archaeologists also distinguish formal and expedient extraction of raw materials (Wilke and Schroth, 1989) and scales of production at quarries for making grinding tools (Schneider, 1993, 1996; Schneider et al., 1995). Ceramics in the Mojave Desert have generally been viewed as exotic in origin, and their scarcity has often relegated them to interesting but analytically limited ad- denda to artifact assemblages. Potsherds have had their most significant application as clear-cut post-650 BP time markers (Griset, 1990, 19%; Lyneis, 1988; Rhode, 1994; Schaefer, 1994a). More recent concerns over the behavioral implications of pottery include questions concerning which (and not whether) ceramic vessels were locally made (Eerkens, 2001; Eerkens et a/., 1999, 2002b; Griset, 1996). In- strumental neutron activation identifies numerous distinctive elemental signatures among pots from the southern Owens Valley and northern Mojave (Eerkens et al., 2002a, p. 215). Although specific clay sources are not identified, the northern Mo- jave clearly shows the greater number of clay signatures (inferred sources), which the authors attribute to higher levels of Mojavean group mobility (Eerkens et ai, 2002a, p. 220). Ceramics are beginning to play an important role in reconstructing settlement in behavioral as well as chronological terms. Southern Deserts The Southern (Colorado and Yuha) deserts share much with the Mojave in terms of timing of cultural developments and time markers, particularly for ear- lier periods (Laylander, 1997b, pp. 76-77; McDonald et al., 1987, pp. 65-66; Schaefer, 1994b, pp. 62-65). Archaeological distinctions are most apparent after AD 750, owing largely to prehistoric exploitation of the lacustrine margins of extinct Lake Cahuilla, which inundated the Saltón Sea trough (Laylander, 1997b; Schaefer, 1994b; Sutton and Wilke, 1988). For a summary of periods predating Lake Cahuilla, see Schaefer (1994b). The Late Prehistoric period (after c. AD 600) is divided into three phases, each related to a stage in the development or decline of Lake Cahuilla (Hildebrand and Hagstrum, 1995, p. 91; Hildebrand et al., 2002, p. 125; Schaefer, 1994b; Sutton and Wilke, 1988). The earliest (Patayan I, AD 600-1000) saw the Colorado River briefly shift its flow and begin to fill the Saltón Trough (Schaefer, 1994b, p. 67). Patayan I is marked by the inception of several ceramic traditions and occupation of the growing shorelines of Lake Cahuilla. Patayan II (AD 1000- 1 500) essentially conforms to the highest levels of the lake and witnessed increased manufacture and exchange of ceramics. There is some suggestion of limited maize</page><page sequence="47">The Archaeology of California 47 agriculture (Bayman et al., 1996, p. 143; Hildebrand and Hagstrum, 1995, p. 92), a development that may have been truncated as the lake formed a barrier in the desert, segregating the ancestors of the ethnographic Cahuilla and Kumeyaay from the Colorado River Yumans to the east. Finally, Patayan III (AD 1500-1769) saw steady desiccation of Lake Cahuilla, abandonment of the shorelines, and more westerly spread of ceramics and (to a limited degree) maize. The latter radiations are probably a consequence of desert peoples' movements and not diffusion per se (Hildebrand and Hagstrum, 1995, p. 1 15). Disruption of settlement at contact hinders resolution of this issue, but models for the Late Prehistoric suggest year- round settlement near permanent water sources (McCarthy, 1993). However, these models have been questioned because lakeshore sites from Patayan II and III yield plant and migratory animal remains that suggest occupation in spring and summer months (Sutton, 1993, p. 1 1; 1998, p. 104). Wildly fluctuating lake levels would have provided an unstable resource base not attractive for long-term (Schaefer, 1994b, p. 69) or year-round settlement (cf. McDonald, 1992). To assess regional settlement variability, pétrographie and elemental con- stituents of clay fabrics recovered from a variety of archaeological contexts have been examined (Hildebrand et al., 2002, pp. 127-128). Sherds derived from three distinctive regional contexts reveal two broadly defined regions of manufacture. Patayan II sherds recovered from widely separated contexts (desert, Peninsular Range [on the western margin of the Southern Deserts region], and Pacific Coast) indicate that desert locales yielded only desert-made ceramics, but sherds recov- ered from Peninsular or coastal contexts derived from both desert and Peninsular sources (Hildebrand et al., 2002, pp. 136-137). The authors - having succeeded in their taxonomic effort - are conservative in their interpretation of the pattern. It may be argued, however, that the pattern suggests movement by desert peoples toward the coast, but not movement by coast/foothill people to the desert. In- deed, Patayan III population levels in the Peninsular Range notably increased with the final desiccation of Lake Cahuilla (Hildebrand and Hagstrum, 1995, p. 115; Schaefer, 1994b, pp. 72-73; Sutton, 1998, p. 96). The antiquity of a wide-ranging, macroregional settlement system, so notable in ethnographic sources (e.g., Bean et al., 1991), clearly warrants further examination. Enigmatic, large rock features, or "geoglyphs," in abstract, zoomorphic, or anthropomorphic patterns appear in the southern deserts (Ezzo and Altschul, 1993; von Werlhof, 1994, 1995), some of which rival in size those of the Atacama Desert of Chile. Many of these huge features are effectively visible only from the air and are not easily explained. Attempts to date the features through cation-ratio AMS have been plagued by problems inherent to the experimental procedure (Dom et al., 1992); provisional dates range from about 800 BC-AD 1 100 (von Werlhof, 1995, p. 62). A second common rock feature is the "fish trap," which is generally a circular arrangement of surface rocks reputed to trap fish along the shores of Lake Cahuilla (Bean et al., 1991 , p. 50). Their dating corresponds to the changing levels</page><page sequence="48">48 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon of the lake. Advances in dating the lake provide chronological inferences for other sites as well (Laylander, 1 997b). Further advances in obsidian hydration and source characterization should improve dating of selected artifacts, and efforts have been made to improve the dating utility of other materials, including exotic shell beads (Rosen, 1995). It remains the case, however, that many (perhaps most) "older" sites are surface manifestations - artifacts, rock rings, and other anomalies - located primarily in or on stable desert pavements (Schaefer, 1994b, p. 63), so future advances in the southern deserts may rest in the hands of specialists engaged in experiments to date rock varnish. There is an unbroken span of occupation of the southern deserts from prehis- tory to the modern era (Schaefer, 1994b, pp. 72-73) and a vibrant ethnographic data base, particularly for the Cahuilla and Kumeyaay (Bean et al., 1991; Dozier, 1998; Shipek, 1991). As a consequence of excellent preservation, there is a wealth of perishable material from a variety of contexts (Bayman et al., 1996; Koerper, 1998; Schaefer, 2000; Sutton, 1998). Such conditions may provide in the future, among other things, critical insights into the development of maize agriculture in southeastern California (Bayman et al., 1996, p. 143; Hildebrand and Hagstrum, 1995, p. 92). CONCLUSIONS California has much to offer to archaeologists engaging in discussions about hunter-gatherer sociopolitical complexity, the delicate balance between paleocli- mate and human populations, specialized production and exchange systems, and vibrant multiethnic communities in densely populated landscapes. Too, California has yielded significant new data on mobile, low-density populations in harsh en- vironments, the antiquity and functions of rock art, the impacts of technological innovations, and the intersection of prehistoric and historical archaeology. Yet many of these advances (and others) have gone fully or partially unnoticed out- side western North America because we have not always succeeded in broaden- ing the appeal of this work to the public, to California Indians today, and to the wider discipline. More research on hunter-gatherer groups is being conducted in California than perhaps any other area; it increasingly belongs at the fore- front of global hunter-gatherer studies, joining the Northwest Coast, Australia, the Paleolithic/Mesolithic, and other key regions and eras. It is a major challenge - perhaps unresolvable - to galvanize California re- searchers as a whole into constructing a coherent or singular theme to describe the state's complex past. The past may seem splintered for several reasons, despite the intensity of work in the state and despite the superb preservation conditions in many areas that provide substantial raw material for high-quality interpretations. A hallmark of the California physical and cultural landscape is its heterogeneity. Exceptional divergences may be found in the region's elevational extremes (sea</page><page sequence="49">The Archaeology of California 49 level to the high Sierra), temperature and moisture extremes (northern coasts to deserts), great differences in architecture and technology, extremes of political complexity and population density, differences in polity size and packing onto the landscape (Fig. 1), and great time depth of investigated archaeological localities (at least 13,000 BP to the late 1800s). This remarkable variability carries into the Historic period, when the Spanish and the Russians, with their distinct agendas, established footholds at opposite ends of the state and affected local groups in very different ways. Also, people on the coasts began to suffer great depredations near missions and presidios as early as 1769, while some interior populations re- mained largely unshaken by colonists until well after the 1848 Gold Rush. So the absence of coherence is less a function of the resolve of California archaeologists and ethnohistorians to halt squabbling and pull themselves together and more a consequence of this intractable heterogeneity. That said, we could be doing a better job of delivering an inviting package of stimulating research results by publishing more broadly and embracing in a com- parative way the research taking place elsewhere. Among current and future lines of investigation that seem most promising - and of great theoretical or method- ological importance - as we enter the twenty-first century, we note the following. First, people may have arrived on the southern California coast and Channel Is- lands as early as anywhere else in western North America. Serious consideration must be given to coastal migration into North America, possibly by boat, with a subsequent population radiation from the coast into the interior. This reverses con- ventional scenarios and could dramatically affect interpretations of Paleo-Indian archaeology of the Americas. An intensive search for early sites will certainly continue. Second, a longstanding and important theme is tracking the timing of technological breakthroughs, such as the adoption of the mortar and pestle (or ceramics) or the origins of oceangoing watercraft. California archaeologists are now poised to redouble their efforts to explore the important demographic and sociopolitical implications of these significant technological innovations. Third, there would seem to be a vast reservoir of untapped household ar- chaeology in the state. Some household projects are underway, but much more could be done, and we need to learn more about the emergence of sedentism and the complicated linkage between social evolution and sedentism. Fourth, the early historical archaeology of California Indians has grown by leaps and bounds during the last decade and has an exciting future. This 1770s-1830s research on multi- ethnic communities, resistance to colonial oppression, persistence of traditional lifeways, technological adoptions, and the like is of great interest to both scholars and contemporary Indians. Fifth, research will continue regarding whether optimal foraging models (the progressive overexploitation school), models based on self-interested choices (e.g., showy hunting behaviors), and/or models that assign primacy to paleoenviron- mental changes best explain major subsistence and cultural changes in California</page><page sequence="50">50 Arnold, Walsh, and Hollimon prehistory. Sixth, the intersection of studies of human health, gender, labor, and demography draws on the expertise of cultural, biological, and archaeological an- thropologists. This synergy is intellectually exciting and has the potential to grow significantly. Although we could identify several other stimulating research direc- tions for the coming decade, we close with a brief mention of cultural complexity. California groups are well represented among societies with the highest hunter- gatherer population densities in the world, among the most intensive shell working and lithic craft specializations in North America, and among the most intensive trade systems. The sociopolitical complexity of groups such as the Chumash was remarkable, and expanded research on groups such as the Yokuts, Porno, and northwestern coastal-riverine groups will be fruitful in light of their large popu- lations, craft production, and other signs of complex organization. We encourage researchers around the world to make productive use of these empirical and the- oretical advances from California as we all strive to broaden our cross-cultural understanding of hunter-gatherer lifeways.
