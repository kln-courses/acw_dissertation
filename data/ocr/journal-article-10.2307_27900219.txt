<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN OPEN LETTER. To the Editor of The Monist: It was with great interest that I read your reply, in The Monist for July, to my article entitled "A Biochemical Conception of the Phenomena of Memory and Sensation" which appeared in the same number. It is not my intention to attempt anything approaching an exhaustive critique of the philosophical position which you assume, ?an attempt which, as some four thousand years of sterile discus sion have demonstrated, would be entirely useless. I am never theless constrained to draw your attention to certain points in which I am of the opinion that you have not represented my position, and that of a number of scientific colleagues, with that fairness which, I believe, we have a right to expect from the editor of a journal "Devoted to the Philosophy of Science." Since a charge of mis representation affects not only the accused, but also his readers, I have taken the liberty, Sir, of addressing you in the time-honored form of an "open letter." In the first place, Sir, I must take exception to the style in which you have expressed yourself concerning my formulation of my hypoth esis of memory in mathematical terms, and in which you have alluded to Professor Loeb's term "associative hysteresis," which he has proposed to substitute, in scientific literature, for the popular term "memory." I know that any suggestion that the mathematical or scientific author is seeking to "impress" or mystify his readers by the use of mathematical symbols or of scientific terms is welcomed by that type of general reader, who, with the common dislike of</page><page sequence="2">628 THE MONIST. humanity for concentrated and specialized effort of any description, is angered by the suggestion, which such terminology conveys to him, that there are problems which cannot be solved off-hand by virtue of a superficial acquaintance with the semi-popular literature of the subject,?that there are intellectual goals which cannot be won without effort,?or, to return to the instance in hand, that the recondite problems of brain-physiology, or, as you prefer to term it, psychology, cannot be solved by one who has not at least that degree of technical knowledge of the subject in hand which is re quired by the Artisan who would construct a steam engine. I rec ognize, I say, the literary effectiveness of your mode of expression, ?but I deny its legitimacy. Your appeal to prejudice is unworthy of you, Sir. But to return to questions less personal than that of controversial style.?On page 390 of your article you state your hypothesis of parallelism as follows: "There are not two separate factors, the psychological and the physiological, running parallel to each other, but there is one reality which has two aspects,?the one being the internal or subjective, the other the external or objective. The two are as inseparable and yet different as the internal and external curves of a circle." If I recollect my Euclid aright, a circle is a line which is without breadth, so that the internal and external curves are coincident and identical. Doubtless you will reply to this that I am pushing a material analogy to the extreme,?that I am taking advantage of an unavoidable imperfection of illustration. But I too am employing analogy, and my illustration of the diffi culty which attaches to your theory is more pertinent than it may at first sight appear. What, I inquire, is the "one reality" to which you refer? In what does it differ from the "substance" of Spinoza? In what do the "two aspects" of the "one reality" differ from his "attributes"? Are they not merely the expression of that disparity between the extent of our "internal information" concerning our own cerebral states, and that of our information concerning the cerebral states of others, upon the origin of which I have dwelt in my article? To pursue our analogy further,?is there any space which separates the internal from the external curves of the circle, ?and, if so, what is its content? I will refrain, however, from pursuing the metaphysical side of our discussion further,?meta physical beliefs are so essentially temperamental in origin that the only logical end to such discussion, between courteous controver sialists, is agreement to differ.</page><page sequence="3">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 629 Your reminder that Professor Haeckel employed the expres sion "gaseous vertebrate" in reference to the anthropomorphic con ception of the deity and not in reference to the dualistic concep tion of the soul was not, perhaps, wholly necessary. Professor Haeckel's works are well known and widely read, and it may be presumed that a writer does not quote such an expression without being perfectly aware of the connection in which it was employed by its author. Yet my extension of the phrase to include the dual istic conception of the soul is not, I venture to affirm, so inapt as you would appear to believe. I grant that the philosophers them selves have, perhaps, never represented the soul in this manner,? but then it is universally admitted that philosophers are men of exceptional intelligence. Would you seriously seek to deny that the dualistic conception of the soul, which is held by the rank-and file of the uneducated and of the cultured alike, is not that of a "gaseous vertebrate, immanent within but independent of the ma terial organism"? How, then, would you account for the belief in ghosts,?so generally denied, so universally entertained,?for the success of its fashionable expression,?the spiritualistic seance? I am, however, constrained to call you to account for yet an other and a more serious misrepresentation. On page 396 of your article you state that: "In spite of the merits of Professor Loeb especially in the line of physiological experiments, in which spe cialty he has distinguished himself, we can not see that psychol ogy would be helped by calling some definite reactions which take place under some definite conditions 'tropisms.' We do not gain a scientific comprehension of these transactions until we gain an insight into the mechanism which upon a definite irritation causes organized life to move in a special direction and in a special way." While I, in common, I believe, with all my biological colleagues, heartily endorse the second of the above two sentences, it is possible that I share with a number of your readers an inability to perceive the precise connection between the two sentences,?or, I may men tion in passing, the exact nature of the part played by "the merits of Professor Loeb" in the question under discussion. Do you really suppose, Sir, as your statement would appear to imply, that the term "tropism" is nothing other than a name employed by Pro fessor Loeb to conceal lack of "a scientific comprehension of these transactions"? Since it is impossible to suppose that this implica tion is a deliberate attempt to misrepresent, one can only conclude that you are either unacquainted with the literature on the subject</page><page sequence="4">630 THE MONIST. of Tropisms, or else that you have utterly failed to grasp the sig nificance of the evidence presented therein. True, the evidence is as yet, in the main, of a qualitative rather than of a quantitative character,?but we learn from your article that the "notion of qual ity" is "tolerated" by you, and this fact should therefore not deter you from perceiving that the investigations which have been carried out by Loeb and his pupils have at least carried us some way towards "an insight into the mechanism which upon a definite irrita tion causes organized life to move in a special direction and in a special way";?that they have shown that these movements can be controlled by physical and chemical means and are therefore, in all probability, the expression of physical and chemical occurrences within the organisms ; and, finally, that they have shown that many of the more complex reactions which we term "instincts" are analysable into simpler elements which are tropisms, i. e., controllable by phys ical and chemical means. If, indeed, you do not perceive in Loeb's theory of tropisms anything other than an empty nominalism,?it is regrettable, but it does not deprive the theory of its value, even in the exclusive domain of psychology. You will recollect Words worth's character of whom it is said: "A primrose by the river's brim A yellow primrose was to him, And it was nothing more." It is usually conceded that these words were not intended to imply default on the part of the primrose,?I leave the further pursuance of the analogy to you, Sir. Abandoning, however, the language of metaphor (although, Sir, in view of your artistic reference to the Sistine Madonna, I may be pardoned my short excursion into the realm of poesy), and returning to the more prosaic vocabulary of scientific discussion, I venture to insist that a statement of a theory is not, in itself, adequate evidence of its validity. It is a simple matter to propound theories, Sir, but it is quite another matter to apply to them the test of fact,?indeed it is for this reason that philosophies and religions are so incomparably more popular than science. In objecting to a theory which is supported by experimental evidence the burden of proof is thrown upon the objector,?he is expected, in scientific discussion, to demonstrate that the theory to which he takes exception is insufficient, and, if at the same time he advances a theory of his own, to demonstrate, not only that his theory is sufficient where the other is insufficient, but that it is also</page><page sequence="5">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 63I in agreement with the facts upon which the opposing theory was based. In your article I find a statement of a theory of memory, which regards this phenomenon as an expression of "the preserva tion of living forms," and I find it stated that my theory of memory is inadequate. Yet I am unable to ascertain from your article what are the facts with which you support these statements. I find, in your article, statements based upon statements, and I find hypotheses evolved from preconceptions, but I do not find statements based upon facts. Finally, Sir, I may be permitted to draw attention to the mis leading nature of your dictum that "Professor Robertson's reduc tion of this statement to a mathematical formula, log = Kr + b, where is the number of syllables memorized, r the number of repetitions, and and b are constants,.... adds nothing to the ex planation of the phenomenon itself." While it is perfectly true that the mathematical formulation of an hypothesis adds nothing whatever to the content of the hypothesis, yet when that mathe matical formulation is applied to quantitative measurements, and the identity between the demands of theory and the facts of experiment is established, then much is added to the "explanation of the phe nomenon itself," for the validity of the hypothesis is rendered pro portionately the more probable. Quantitative evidence differs in no respect from qualitative evidence, save in the fact that the qualities compared are expressed in numerical units ; but since the acquisition of qualitative must necessarily precede that of quantitative evidence, our knowledge of a phenomenon is the more complete the more it assumes a quantitative character.
