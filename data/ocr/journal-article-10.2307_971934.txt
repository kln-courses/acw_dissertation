<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 87 upon Thompson's hypothesis and sees Comalcalco be- ing ruled by Palenque as a "provincial outpost," in even greater proximity to the coast. Joseph Ball and Jennifer Taschek present an interpretation that differs from Andrews's and Thompson's both in terms of chronology and sociopolitical interpretation in their paper in Mesoamerica After the Decline of TeotEhuacan A.D. 700-900 (edited by Diehl and Berlo, 1989). Ball and Tascheck suggest that Comalcalco was an "entre- pot" or a subsphere of Palenque for the Cholan trade network. According to their argument, when the site of Palenque collapsed there was a migration of Pal- enque people into Comalcalco, where they continued their"Palenque" heritage and customs, which even- tually evolved into Nahua-Maya. There is no question that there are similarities be- tween Palenque and Comalcalco: Andrews shows us specific examples by comparing buildings at both sites (i.e., Figure 121). However, the nature of the relation and the degree of sociocultural contact is still enigmatic and probably will remain so until we are better in- formed about the chronology of Comalcalco. Similar- ities in structural style are not necessarily indicative of contemporaneity or sharing of cultural traits. For ex- ample, ball courts are found as far north as southern Arizona, as far south as Costa Rica, and as far east as the island of Puerto Rico. One of the most interesting features of Comalcalco is a tomb inside Temple V of the Great Acropolis. The tomb was discovered in 1925 by Franz Blom and Ol- iver LaFarge and has been compared to Pacal's burial at Palenque. Stuccoed figures in the Tomb of the Nine Lords of the Night at Comalcalco have been compared with the ones on the walls of Pacal's tomb underneath the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque. Eric Thompson originally suggested that both sets of figures represent the nine lords of the Maya underworld. An- drews draws attention to the similarities in the figures of the two tombs-in their execution in low relief, rep- resenting "realistic" human forms (p. 95). An icono- graphic and thematic comparison of these two sets of figures indicates a similar theme. Stylistically, how- ever, they seem to vary. The Palenque figures are more elaborately dressed while the ones in Comalcalco wear loincloths with more simple headdresses. I would add that the personages at Comalcalco are also similar in gestures and attire to the figures in procession on one of the Bonampak murals (west wall of Room l, Struc- ture 1). Chapter 7 presents the corpus of graffiti incised on bricks in various buildings and provides numerous line drawings. There is a large degree of variation in the subject matter of these informal descriptions. Of par- ticular interest is an anthropomorphic winged figure looking as though it were attempting to fly. It is similar to the figure on the upper part of Stela 21 from the site of Oxkintok in the Puuc Hills (Pollock, The Puuc: An Architectural Survey of the Hill Country of Yucatan and Northern Campeche, Mexico, 1980). Anthropomor- phic winged figures are scarce and unique in Meso- american iconography, and the few examples that we have from the Yucatan seem to depict God K. A God K form with wings along his upper arms comes from Structure 4B 1 at Sayil. A miscellaneous sculpture piece in bas-relief from Maxcanu represents another anthro- pomorphic figure with a snake foot. Chapter 8 is a very short catalog of the hieroglyphic inscriptions. The chapter documents the various lo- cations where ancient writing is found, but no deci- pherments are offered. At Comalcalco, inscriptions are written on brick, and an Initial Series date of 9. 1 5.3 . 13. 13 has been suggested. The volume ends with a brief summary and an epilogue that summarizes the relative conclusions of the Comalcalco survey project, reiterating the similarities of this site to Palenque. While granting the importance and value of An- drews's comprehensive survey of the core section of Comalcalco, and his detailed measurements thereof, there is one important shortcoming of the study. A1- though the author describes and divides the site into three clusters of buildings he does not offer any soci- ocultural explanation or analysis of the settlement pat- tern. Description, ideally, should lead to some func- tional and sociocultural interpretation. Andrews has labeled the three largest and most im- portant groups of buildings as (1) the North Plaza, (2) Acropolis Plaza, and (3) East Acropolis. This apparent division suggests the existence of three political, eco- nomic, or religious foci that probably framed and maintained the ancient community at Comalcalco. Fu- ture anthropologically oriented research at this site should attempt to illuminate these and other processual matters. There are a few technical problems with the publi- cation such as printing errors on the foldout maps (numbers 12 and 13) where the north arrow is directed toward the east. Another very aggravating feature is that Andrews at times uses the English system of mea- surement referring to "feet," while in other places he uses the metric system. These flaws notwithstanding, Andrews's survey study clearly represents a major contribution to Maya set- tlement-pattern research. The maps are extremely valuable in presenting an accurate layout plan of Com- alcalco. The fact that so much archaeological work has been done at Comalcalco by American and Mexican institutions, and that so little has been published, makes Andrews's efforts in presenting his data all the more excellent and commendable. Classic Maya Political History: Hieroglyphic and Ar- chaeological Evidence. T. PATRICK CULBERT, editor.

Unlike many if</page><page sequence="2">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 88 Lintels 2 and 3 at Piedras Negras are examples of the "peaceful visit(s) of one lord to the city of another" (p. 228). Schele and Mathews also discuss the glyphic rec- ord of marriage and warfare. The maps of these interaction patterns are extremely interesting. Royal visits are recorded mostly along the Usumacinta drainage, except for Tikal and El Peru (Figure 10.6, p. 241). Royal marriage exchanges center on the Usumacinta and Peten, reaching as far east as Naranjo (Figure 10.7, p. 244) and included an ex- tremely long-distance match between a Palenque bride and the fifteenth king of Copan (see also p. 147). Fi- nally, warfare, possibly "flowery war"-type ritual ex- changes of sacrificial victims, occurred between pairs of sites from Palenque and Tonina in the west to Qui- rigua and Copan in the southeast (Figure 10.8, p. 247, see also pp. 143-144). At the heart of the significant new thinking in this volume lies the Maya textual expression known as "the emblem glyph," on which Peter Mathews is without doubt the preeminent specialist (Chapter 2). The nature and meaning ofthe emblem glyph, although the subject of much discourse and debate since Heinrich Berlin's original 1958 article, are still only imprecisely known. Emblem glyphs consist of a prefix, which is ordinarily phonetic, and a main sign, which is usually ideograph- ic. The prefix was deciphered by Floyd Lounsbury in the 1970s as ah po or ahau-a Maya word rich in mythical and metaphoric resonance denoting kingship and/or royal status (p. 23). The second component is a specific and variable main sign which, in Mathews's view, distinguishes one region or "city-state"-sized polity from another (pp. 27-29; see also p. 52). The size of Classic Maya polities turns out to be one ofthe first and major results of emblem-glyph research, and one of the more interesting features of this volume. Mathews (p.29) posits an average size of 2,500 square kilometers for approximately "two dozen independent polities in the southern Maya lowlands at 9.18.0.0.0 (AD 790)." That such an inference can be drawn, con- sistent with a reasoned use of both archaeological and textual data, marks a new threshold of sophistication in Mayanist scholarship. Each site with an emblem glyph (with the lone ex- ception of Palenque and Tortuguero) stands alone within a region having an average size of 2,500 square kilo- meters (as defined by the use of Thiessen polygons, p. 28). Smaller sites may have hieroglyphic inscriptions within these regions but, by hypothesis, these sites lack their own emblem glyphs, and appear to constitute vassal centers of the emblem-glyph sites. The "city- state" model thus describes the basic political unit of the Classic period as a single population center (city) surrounded by a small sustaining area. Importantly, Mathews's model of the size, shape, and organization of Classic Maya polities was influ- enced by, and suggests strong continuity with, that of the Postclassic provinces of Yucatan described and an- alyzed by Ralph L. Roys (1957) in his Political Ge- ography. It is a longstanding tenet of Maya archaeology that the transition from Classic to Postclassic in the Lowlands reflected at the very least a drastic restruc- turing of social and political power. If the provinces of sixteenth-century Yucatan resembled those of the Pe- not most of the "archaeology by select committee" School of American Research seminars, the chapters in this book approximate a single text, with a logical and substantive coherence lacking in most scholarly . . compl atlons. Norman Hammond and Peter Mathews begin with introductory chapters recounting the history and sig- nificance for sociopolitical reconstruction of hiero- glyphic decipherment. Peter Mathews, Gordon Willey, and Linda Schele then provide outline sketches of Late Classic regional political units and their histories (more or less tied to archaeology) for the western and south- western quarters of the southern Lowlands. Christo- pher Jones then offers a masterful synthesis of the in- scriptions of Tikal, at the heart of the Classic Maya world. Jones's chapter leads in substance to Culbert's review ofthe archaeology and epigraphy ofthe adjacent northeast Peten. Moving southeast, William L. Fash and David S. Stuart offer the most overwhelming array of new data in the volume-that concerning the past decade of re- search at Copan. Fash and Stuart's chapter marks the first widely available scholarly overview and synthesis of the results of the various Copan projects of the past 15 years. The Copan Project, like no other except the Tikal Project as described in Jones's chapter, has ef- fectively analyzed the texts in their archaeological, es- pecially architectural, settings, providing a convincing reconstruction of the ancient sociopolitical milieu. The wealth of new information on kingship, war, and ritual in the period A.D. 435-822 in this chapter alone jus- tifies the purchase of this book for every student and scholar remotely interested in archaeological recon- structions of ancient mesoamerican society. Robert J. Sharer rounds out the volume's coverage of the south- eastern region with a review of the archaeology and epigraphy of Quirigua. Breaking the west-to-center-to-east geographic pro- gression of the articles is Linnea H. Wren and Peter Schmidt's somewhat inaptly titled chapter on "Elite Interaction During the Terminal Classic Period" at Chichen Itza. Schmidt, as curator of the Regional Mu- seum of Anthropology in Merida, has rediscovered and saved for posterity literally hundreds of"lost" mon- uments and artifacts from American and Mexican ex- cavations in the first half of this century. One of these monuments, related by glyphic text and iconography to the Great Ball Court at Chichen, is a vital piece of evidence supporting the revisionist ar- gument that the so-called Toltec art and iconography of Chichen Itza belongs to the Terminal Classic period and was the product of persons who spoke no other language and can be considered of no other ethnicity than Yucatec Maya. There is little actual analysis or even discussion, however, of elites or the "elite inter- action" described in the chapter heading. The most unusual chapter in this colume, which one hopes suggests the direction of epigraphic research in the future, is Linda Schele and Peter Mathews's essay on the textual records of"royal visits and intersite relationships among the Classic Maya" (Chapter 10). Nothing so detailed and specific has ever before been published regarding the actual behavior of individuals mentioned in the inscriptions. The group scenes on [Vol. 3, No. 1, 1992]</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 89 ten and adjacent regions during the eighth and ninth centuries with regard to size, demographics, and in- ternal organization, the argument for such disjunction is considerably weakened. A city-state model of Lowland Maya political struc- ture is hardly new, as Norman Hammond reminds us in his general overview (pp. 12-13). Sylvanus G. Mor- ley drew the analogy to the city-states that character- ized the political life of Greece from Homeric times of the Macedonian conquest at least as early as The An- cient Maya in 1946. Morley also compared the Maya "statelets" to the medieval principalities of central Eu- rope, and Mathews's estimated average territory rather precisely approximates that of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which covers 2,586 square kilometers (998 square miles). In a similar comparative vein, Nor- man Yoffee makes the highly significant observation that the Maya geopolitical order strikingly resembled that of the "unstable and evanescent" southern Me- sopotamian city states (p. 289). Relevant comparisons with similar "palaeo-technic" pre- or subnational states and societies thus join eth- nohistoric analogy to the period of initial contact with the Spanish and Mathews's own conclusions based on his knowledge of the Maya inscriptions to support a model of smaller, rather than larger, Classic period political units. Despite this seeming preponderance of the evidence, T. Patrick Culbert insists that the question of the av- erage territorial extent of the Classic Maya provinces "remains unresolved" (p. 140). Culbert would support some variant of Joyce Marcus's original hypothesis that certain emblem glyphs denominate large political units wherein several other cities, whose inscriptions also recite distinct emblem-glyph phrases, might have owed allegiance to a single, regional capital. Culbert's most powerful argument is that the glyphic evidence simply does not contain sufficient internal information to determine conclusively whether the possession of an emblem glyph denotes a politically independent pol- ity or one which owes some kind of allegiance to an- other: "there has been no attempt to claim a general principle that having a name makes a polity indepen- dent" (p. 1 4 l). The uncertainty of glyphic interpretation has several levels. The decipherment of the Maya inscriptions re- mains, if indeed beyond its infancy, still in adolescence. The first level concerns the current stage of decipher- ment. Although the phonetic transcription of the texts is now possible for 90 percent of some monuments and probably 50 percent of others, such transcription does not always indicate a certain reconstruction of Maya words, syntax, and grammar recorded. Much less does the most accurate phonetic transcription guarantee an emic understanding of the messages carved over a thousand years ago. Second, even when a text can be "read aloud" in reconstructed eighth-century Maya with every word near certainly comprehended (a distinctly rare case), Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions are hardly full, narra- tive expositions of anything approaching descriptive history. I do not think Linda Schele adequately cap- tures the full scope of this uncertainty when she writes (p. 73) that "we have only the records of the winners in a lifestyle characterized by internal competition" and "that the public inscriptions were primarily in- struments of public propaganda and political policy." It must also be emphasized that we have not accepted or even proposed adequate models of Maya social or- ganization, Maya kingship, or Maya ideology and re- ligion that can be compared with the data recovered. The absence of such analytical models restricts our ability to evaluate the interpretations we proposed of texts. Most Mayanists are not yet in a position to say whether we can accept this reading or interpretation of a text or site as opposed to others because it fits our expectations based on comparisons with the social and political structure of other similar cultures. In this vein, the contributions of Norman Hammond and Norman Yoffee are invaluable. It is a regrettable truth that Mayanists constitute a remarkably provin- cial clique within academe. If one examines the ref- erences section at the end of the present volume, one sees that the list of authors cited has scarcely changed. The recitation of"Adams, Andrews, Ashmore, Ball, Bullard, Coe, Coggins, etc." can be found in almost every SAR book on the Maya to date. Notable in the present volume are scattered addi- tions such as "Diakonoff, Falkenstein, Hocart, Jacob- sen . . . Runciman, Tambiah." Most of these are owed to Norman Yoffee's truly pathbreaking attempt to see the Maya in light of Mesopotamia and make compar- isons in greater detail than the trite "complex societies" mode of analogy. Norman Hammond points to nu- merous other fertile Old World fields for comparative study. Mayanists could learn, perhaps, more than they are willing to accept from such comparisons. For example, Yoffee cites Hocart among students "of the evolution of political power" (p. 301). Yet Ho- cart, now considered in the mainstream of develop- ment of modern social anthropology, provides just what Mayanists lack: structural models based on compara- tive study and an effective comparative methodology for developing these models. It is perplexing to me that scholars who recognize the "Blood of Kings" as an epithet suitable for the description of Classic Maya society do not cite works outside their field that deal with "Kingship and Sacrifice" in ancient Hawaii (sure- ly a precisely comparable social setting) or "Sacrifice in Africa." Nor are the epistemological paradoxes il- luminated in Marshall Sahlins's studies of structure in historical myth and metaphor (or similar works by Africanist Luc de Heusch and Mesoamericanists Ru- dolph van Zantwijk and Susan Gillespie) deemed wor- thy of mention. Mayanists should indeed be more con- cerned about the ways in which myth and worldview inform dynastic histories, which are so clearly pre- sented in terms of divine iconography and sacrificial events. Classic Maya Political History is itself a monument. The contributions taken together report the status of our current knowledge and interpretation of elite public expression in the Maya Lowlands during the period A.D. 250-1000. This expression is known to us entirely through hieroglyphic texts-mostly carved in stone, on stelae and buildings-which are often associated with stylized and iconographic portraits of rulers and their associates. But until Mayanists become more genuinely</page><page sequence="4">[Vol. 3, No. 1, 1992] 9o LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY familar with the methods and substantive theory of social anthropology and structuralism, they will fail to make the maximum use of the rich data base that now lies open as a result of the triumphs of hieroglyphic decipherment. Inka Settlement Planning. JOHN HYSLOP. Univer- sity of Texas Press, Austin, 1990. xv + 377 pp., maps, plans, photographs, notes, bibliography, in- dex. $30.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Timothy Earle, University of California- Los Angeles. In his expensive and well-produced book, John Hys- lop synthesizes what we know about the organization of Inka settlements. He brings together, in an accessible format, diverse historical and archaeological materials, much of which have been published previously in ob- scure places. He then adds a wealth of original docu- mentation that he collected throughout the territories of the Inka empire. Detailed descriptions are aug- mented with many photographs and illustrations. No one needs to be reminded of the incredible ac- complishment of the Inka empire in conquering and controlling lands from Argentina and Chile, through Peru and Bolivia, to northern Ecuador. Most work, either historical or archaeological, has focused on lim- ited areas within this vast empire such that we are left with detailed but often isolated descriptions of frag- ments of the empire. We know about the Inka around the capital of Cuzco or in the central Mantaro Valley, but what do we know of the Inka empire in its totality? Very little. Starting with his much-cited book, The Inka Road Systems (1984), Hyslop has set out to compile evidence on the empire from Ecuador to Argentina. This work has led him along the extensive roads of the empire, recording as he traveled. The present volume is a complement to the Roads book, concentrating on the imperial settlements along the roads. The book is organized as an eclectic series of topics, including different types of Inka settlements (the capital of Cuzco, administrative centers, forts, mixed Inka- local settlements), settlement organization (orthogonal and radial patterns, astronomical orientation and alignment), and other associations (rocks and outcrops, water, and other environmental factors). Hyslop shows a concern for the political and economic character of the empire, but his love seems to be for its ideology and cosmology. Although this book is impressive in its scope and thoroughness, I felt unsatisfied-hungry for more. While he opens up the empire for broad investigation, ulti- mately I did not feel that I had learned about how the empire worked. What is still needed is a systematic scrutiny of variation within the strategies of incorpo- ration and integration. For example, in Argentina, for- tifications were common and storage facilities small scale; the reverse was true in central Peru. Hyslop's approach is primarily descriptive. What is lacking is an analytical model of imperial conquest and rule that can be evaluated against the wealth of evidence. Hys- lop's descriptive approach results in a set of reasonable, but largely ad hoc and unrelated explanations for the observed patterns. How these explanations fit (or do not fit) into more general and comprehensive expla- nations of the Inka is left to others. I do not want to belittle the impressive accomplish- ment of Hyslop's work. His two books are encyclo- pedic. Every Andean scholar must have them on the bookshelf for constant and reliable reference. I can al- ready imagine many uses of Inka Settlement Planning as I attempt to define a dynamic political model of the Inka empire. Others, with totally different goals, will also reach for the book with gratitude for Hyslop's tireless work.</page></plain_text>
