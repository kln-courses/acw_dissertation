<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS ENVIRONMENT, AGRICULTURE AND CONSERVATION Advances in resource management: tributes to W.R. Derrick Sewell. Edited by HAROLD D. FOSTER. London: Belhaven Press, 1993, 336 pp. ?39.50. ISBN 1 85293 292 9 This book is dedicated to the memory of Professor W.R. Derrick Sewell, a leading light in the field of environmental resource management and one of Canada's best known geographers. It takes the form of a collection of 13 papers, contributed by his friends, colleagues and associates. There are really three books rolled into one here. Firstly, it constitutes a moving and impressive tribute to Professor Sewell, charting his prolific and valuable contributions to environmental resource manage- ment. Secondly, it represents an assemblage of the views and recent research of various leading authori- ties in the field. Thirdly, and perhaps most impor- tantly, it is an assessment of the current state, achievements and challenges of a wide variety of environmental resource management issues. A major theme in at least four of the chapters is the water resource, but other contributions focus on recreation, health, forests, meteorological services and the role of geographic information systems. Theory and practice issues are examined via discus- sions of appropriate research methods, data collec- tion problems and public policy debates. The regional spread of the contributions partly fol- lows that of Derrick Sewell's own work, and includes Canada, Australia, the Middle East and Thailand. Inevitably, as with any collection of diverse papers, the treatment of topics is very variable in both breadth and depth. Such heterogeneity can be seen as both a strength and a weakness. This is perhaps not a book for the specialist in a particular field of environmental management. The strength of this volume is that it brings together recent research and achievements in selected areas of environmental resource manage- ment and provides a much needed insight into the opinions and attitudes of leading authorities. According to the Prologue, this book is intended to repay some of the intellectual debt that so many of its authors owe Professor Sewell. It surely succeeds. LOUISE CHITTOCK Economic values and the natural world. By DAVID PEARCE. London: Earthscan, 1993, 129 pp. ?10.95. ISBN 1 85383 152 2 This book continues and amplifies themes developed by Pearce in the two Blueprintsfor a Green Economy. It comprises four principal chapters and a conclusion, together with two substantial appendices, one on environmental policy as a constraint on economic growth, the other on monetary valuation techniques. As such, it is a useful and accessible account of some of the things that environmental economists do. The book is essentially an apologia for an econom- ics of the environment. Pearce recognizes that many environmentalists have fundamental reservations about environmental economics and that some have made little effort to understand how economics may be applied to environmental problems. He argues that economists do not value the environment but rather they value the preferences people have for it. Environmental economics is unashamedly anthro- pocentric (although on page 13 it is described as anthropomorphic) but Pearce claims that this does not prejudice any intrinsic non-monetary value the environment has. This reviewer doubts if Pearce will convince scep- tical environmentalists. The gist of his argument is that economics is morally, ethically and politically neutral. In practice, by using monetary values which have apparent precision and familiarity, economics presents the environment as having solely monetary value. In modem society the idea that economic val- ues are the only values is rife. Part of the crisis of modernism is this very colonisation by economics of the lifeworld and of the natural world. It is revealing that the title of the book uses the term 'natural world' but throughout the book, the less emotive term 'environment' appears. At the heart of the modem project is the domination of nature by the application of science and economics. For many environmentalists, the crisis in relations between humanity and the natural world is that of science and economics. Solutions to it involving yet more of the same fail to address the fundamental problem. So books such as this will never convince deep ecolo- gists. JOHN BRADBEER Conservation in Progress. Edited by F.B. GOLDSMITH and A. WARREN. Chichester: John Wiley and Sons, 1993, 364 pp. ?19.95. ISBN 0 471 93641 3 This is the third book stemming from the work of the Ecology and Conservation Unit at University College London, and edited by Barrie Goldsmith and Andrew Warren. The previous volumes appeared in 1974 and 1983, so nine years seems to be the statutory span for these collections. Does this book match up to the previous ones, which achieved considerable success? In this reviewer's opinion it 335</page><page sequence="2">does, giving the editors a commendable record of consistency. This volume consists of 20 chapters, each by a single author, which are grouped into four sections entitled Concepts, Species and Habitats, Approaches to Conservation and Organizations. The individual chapters are very different in style and approach. However, this adds to the readability of the book. It is not a textbook, but will certainly be included in any bibliography for conservation stu- dents. A further value is its contemporary perspec- tive, vital in the rapidly changing organizational framework for conservation both in Britain and internationally. This perspective is well supported by a number of up-to-date bibliographies. This reviewer did not read any chapter without profit, and in some ways it is invidious to pick out specific contributions. However, to give a bit more of the flavour of the book the reviewer has chosen five. Max Nicholson's 'Pilgrim's Progress' is eloquent, per- suasive and informed. Carolyn Harrison andJacqui Burgess give refreshing and illuminating insights into the importance of, respectively, popular views and the mass media for conservation in Britain. Much lip service is paid to these ideas, but these two chapters support their views with current research. Barrie Goldsmith gives an admirably succinct analysis of the problems of monitoring for conservation. Finally, Peter Marren's gloriously irreverent 'Siege of the NCC', presents in the most lucid way a picture which simultaneously provokes laughter and tears. The final four sentences should be the epitaph for current and past government misdeeds throughout the public sector. This reviewer looks forward to the fourth in the series in 2002. As a geographer and conservationist the reviewer hopes that the volume could be entitled Conservation in Place, but this book shows how far there is to go. The UCL Unit has made a significant contribution to advancing the cause of conservation, and Conservation in Progress is a worthy part of that effort. GORDON DICKINSON Leisure and the Environment: Essays in hon- our of Professor J.A. Patmore. Edited by S. GLYPTIS. London: Belhaven Press, 1993, 311 pp. ?39.50. ISBN 1 85293 258 9 Amongst the geographers who have pioneered the study of recreation and leisure, Allan Patmore's work has been outstanding. It is fitting, therefore, that his retirement be honoured by a collection of essays to mark his considerable achievements. Here Glyptis has drawn together an impressive list of some 24 contributors, academics and practitioners, for this commemorative volume. The text, with its ambitious theme of leisure and environment, is set on a broad canvas but strives to achieve a focus by casting essays within six thematic sections. These explore perception and social change, planning, management and conservation, economic change, the special environments of wilderness and National Parks, and the global en- vironment. With a relatively large number of contributors, the individual essays are variable in style and content, although always relevant and of interest. In keeping with the book's primary aim of reviewing its subject, most essays are short. This is both a strength and a weakness. For the student seeking an introduction to a topic, many of the chapters will be most useful but the reader who already possesses expertise will per- haps be frustrated that topics are not always plumbed in depth and that some material will already be familiar. The text is also preoccupied with the rural environment. Recreational geographers have long been guilty of neglecting the urban en- vironment which is, for the majority, the primary venue for our leisure, and this text reinforces rather than redresses this imbalance. The level of illustra- tion is also disappointing and at no stage matches the fine example set in Patmore's own books. However, Leisure and Environment is still a valuable review of the field that ought to be on the shelves of every university and college library where leisure is taught, although it will need a more competitively priced paperback edition to make it accessible to the student market. STEPHEN WILLIAMS Landscape sensitivity. Edited by D.S.G. THOMAS and RJ. ALLISON. Chichester: John Wiley and Sons, 1993, 347 pp. ?65.00. ISBN 0 471 93636 7 An understanding of landscape sensitivity is crucial to its management. The notion of 'sensitivity' implies that there are thresholds between stability and insta- bility, between the status quo and change. It is a con- cept which is crucial, therefore, to the analysis of all landscapes. Landscapes, and geomorphological sys- tems in particular, also display differing response times, magnitudes and rates of change, and paths to new forms or recovery. This book is divided into three sections, dealing in turn with landscape sensitivity in the context of geo- morphological processes (including those related to climatic change), landscape sensitivity under agricul- tural and pastoral land uses, and (briefly) within the built environment. Threshold states are complex. This makes a post- event analysis much easier than the prediction that thresholds are about to be crossed. From the man- agement point of view this means that repair is more common than prevention. From the academic point 336 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
