<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHELLEY AND SHAW BY ROLAND A. DUERKSEN OMMENTATORS on the works of George Bernard Shaw almost invariably acknowl- edge his great indebtedness to Shelley. Their remarks are, however, limited to a passing state- ment or, at most, a page or two in which Shaw's enthusiasm for Shelley receives a very general treatment-several quotations from Shaw (and there are two or three favorites) usually being cited as evidence which needs little if any elabo- ration. Few of the numerous instances in which Shaw directly acknowledges his debt to Shelley have been noted by critics, to say nothing of an examination of decidedly Shelleyan ideas which are prominent in Shaw's writings.' I propose, therefore, to trace in considerable detail the back- ground of Shaw's interest in Shelley, its effect upon him, his opinions about Shelley and his art, and especially his agreements and disagreements with important ideas held by Shelley. Though in style the two writers are vastly dis- similar, Shelley was among the three or four thinkers whose ideas had the greatest influence on Shaw's convictions about man and society. The respective ideological impacts of WVagner and Ibsen may have been as great as that of Shelley; but had it not been for Shelley's earlier domina- tion of Shaw's thinking, the importance to him of both Wagner and Ibsen would have been greatly reduced. As Shelley's influence preceded theirs in point of time, it also took precedence in confirm- ing Shaw in his fundamental ways of thought. In addition to influencing Shaw in his own right, Shelley, as a pre-socialist, had helped to found the socialism which was crescent late in the nine- teenth century and which formed the basis of Shaw's creed. Among Shaw's contemporaries who also experienced Shelley's strong generative influence are Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells, W. B. Yeats, and Bertrand Russell. Unlike some earlier Shelleyites, Shaw did not outgrow his enthusiasm for Shelley. Reminiscing in old age about his boyhood interest in dancing, music, and literature, he boasted to his neighbor and biographer Stephen Winsten of his retained memory and skill in these areas. By way of dem- onstration he tried a few waltz steps, hummed some Brahms, and declaimed Shelley.2 That the first poet to come to Shaw's mind in this situation should be Shelley is only natural; as a youth he had read him perhaps more intensively than he had read any other writer. In a letter of 1924, after recalling his boyhood enthusiasm for Byron, Shaw declares, "When I was nearing twenty, Shelley got me; and I went into him head over heels and read every word he published. That was a sort of literary falling in love: Shelley's king- dom was not of this world for me."3 Looking at the same experience with Shelley from another point of view, Shaw, in a chapter entitled "Biographers' Blunders Corrected," tells of his liberation from certain concepts which society had imposed upon him: "Paine had been held up to me as a drunken staymaker without a redeeming trait. Voltaire and Rousseau, I was taught, were blasphemers whose deathbeds were made frightful by their certainty of going to hell. It was then part of the education of a gentleman to convince him that the three most religious men in Europe had been impious villains, and were roasting in blazing brimstone to all eternity. Shelley cured me of all that. I read him prose and verse, from beginning to end. This took place at the end of my teens."4 And speaking to Winsten of this period of his life, Shaw said, "I was satu- rated with the works of Bunyan, Shelley, and Dickens."' Shaw's adoption of the atheism which Shelley professed6 is one indication of Shelley's effectual power upon him, as compared to that exerted by the other two writers. Publicly, in his role as young socialist, Shaw boldly placed himself on Shelley's side by his well-known, intentionally shocking remark in 1 See, however, Kenneth Neill Cameron, The Young Shelley: Genesis of a Radical (New York, 1950), p. 390 n. In this long note Professor Carmeron presents an admirable resume of views expressed by Shaw at meetings of the Shelley Society and points out other aspects of Shaw's interest in Shelley. 2 Stephen Winsten, Shaw's Corner (London, 1952), p. 107. 3 To a Young Actress: The Letters of Bernard Shaw to Molly Tompkins, ed.

Duerksen 115 1886 at the first general meeting of the Shelley Society: "Like Shelley, I am a Socialist, an Athe- ist, and a Vegetarian."7 Years later he declared that by this statement he had risked everything on Shelley's behalf and that he had thereby for- feited every chance of gaining a foothold in polite society except to go all out and give society no quarter. "I praised it," he said, "for the very qualities it despised."8 Yet Shaw was fair with society. In 1897, shortly after the prosecution of the freethinking editor Annie Besant, he made his first public speech at one of the debates of the Zetetical Society. Defending the State's action in depriv- ing Mrs. Besant of her children, he presented a parallel defense of the State's similar decision in the earlier case of Shelley.9 He was not objecting to Shelley's opinions but was, rather, voicing his often-reiterated conviction that an effective society acts consistently. Tellilng, in his 1921 preface to Immaturity, of his early support of Shelley's heterodox opinions, Shaw says, "Read my preface to Back to Me- thuselah, and you will see me as the complete infidel of that day. I had read much poetry; but only one poet was sacred to me: Shelley. I had read his works piously from end to end, and was in my negations atheist and republican to the backbone. I say in my negations; for I had not reached any affirmative position."'0 These early negations, derived from Shelley's influence, prepared the way for Shaw's accept- ance of Ibsen's principles: "Ibsen had not shocked me in the least. Why was I immune? Because an earlier enchanter had taken me far outside the bounds of middle-class idealism within which Ibsen's bombshells were deadly. I am not by nature a good bourgeois any more than Shelley was; and I was a strong Shelleyan long before I ever heard of Ibsen."" Shelley's powerful influence had emboldened Shaw to pro- claim his support of unconventional views such as the belief that a child's hostility to a parent was not wicked or abnormal, but natural. Instead of discovering later that he must abandon these ideas (as Browning and Disraeli had), Shaw found them strengthened and brought to matu- rity by his study of Ibsen, Wagner, and other progressive thinkers. An indication of the seriousness of Shaw's enthusiasm for Shelley is his adoption of vege- tarianism-a practice which he derived directly from Shelley and to which he adhered throughout his life. "I was a cannibal for twenty-five years," he wrote. "For the rest I have been a vegetarian. It was Shelley who first opened my eyes to the savagery of my diet; but it was not until 1880 or thereabouts that the establishment of vegetarian restaurants in London made a change practicable for me."'2 When an old man, Shaw told his friend Winsten, It was Shelley who converted me to vegetarianism. ... You see, vegetarianism to Shelley, like marriage and atheism, was a form of poetry. I am always asked how it is that my opinions have changed so little since my youth. It is because I got to them by poetry. As I always say, the aesthetic is the most convincing and permanent. Shelley made his ideas sing; I made them dance.... He converted me not by his suffering, but by the sheer logic of his poetry. There is no falsehood, no calumny, no torture which the mere expression of a simple truth does not provoke.'3 This dedication to the expression of a simple truth, despite the consequences, Shaw admired most in Shelley; when the "simple truth" pointed out by Shelley was one which convinced him that the eating of meat necessitated an illogical and brutal killing of fellow living beings, he aban- doned it for this reason alone. He has nothing but scorn for the person who becomes a vegetarian solely to improve his own health. In the preface to Heartbreak House he writes of the house, which is his symbol for pre-World-War-I Europe: "Being an idle house it was a hypochondriacal house, always running after cures. It would stop eating meat, not on valid Shelleyan grounds, but 7 See Archibald Henderson, George Bernard Shaw: Man of the Century (New York, 1936), p. 151. In a footnote Hender- son points out that the remark is not found in the minutes of the Shelley Society. Shaw later (in the preface to Immaturity, p. xx) says of this declaration: "I did not know that I could have expressed my position more accurately by simply saying that my conception of God was that insisted on in the first Article of the Church of England.... I had never thought of reading the Articles of the Church of England; and if I had I should still have used the word atheist as a declaration that I was on the side of Bradlaugh and Foote and others who, as avowed Secularists and Atheists, were being persecuted and imprisoned for my opinions." Shaw repeated the declaration in 1892 at a vegetarian banquet commemorating the Shelley Centenary. See "A Feast for Faddists," Pall Mall Gazette, LIV (27 June 1892), 2. 8 Winsten, Days with Bernard Shaw, p. 196. 9 R. F. Rattray, Bernard Shaw: A Chronicle (Luton, England, 1951), p. 34.

By persisting in this overt practice he also symbolized a commitment to Shelleyan ideas generally-a commitment more substantial than had been symbolized by Browning's two-year stand as a vegetarian. The absolute sincerity and dedication to simple truth which he found to be the cause of Shelley's vegetarianism was evident to Shaw as the very basis of the Romantic poet's thinking: Shelley "did not go back upon his opinions in the least as he grew older. By the time he had begun The Triumph of Life, he had naturally come to think Queen Mab a boyish piece of work, not that what it affirmed seemed false to him or what it denied true, but because it did not affirm and deny enough. Thus there is no excuse for Shelley on the ground of his youth or rashness. If he was a sin- ner, he was a hardened sinner and a deliberate one."'5 Shaw names Shelley among the twelve men of genius whose peculiar sense of the world he recognizes as more or less akin to his own.'6 In his unsentimentalized and fearless exposition of the truth, an approach which designates the heretic in society, Shaw sought always to follow Shelley. But he found that the society of his time had sunk so low in moral listlessness and had become so callous to criticism that all the force of his on- slaught was destroyed by a simple public policy of nonresistance. As early as 1903 he laments, "In vain do I redouble the violence of the language in which I proclaim my heterodoxies. I rail at the theistic credulity of Voltaire, the amoristic super- stition of Shelley." Yet Shaw finds that, instead of insisting that he, the "inconceivable Satanist," be sent to the stake, the respectable newspapers hail his new books in commendatory terms, thus putting at ease the ordinary citizen who reads him "as he reads Micah, with undisturbed edifi- cation from his own point of view.''l7 Shaw came to feel that Shelley relied too greatly on love as the panacea for all ills, but by his own admission, to term this reliance an "amoristic superstition" is an exaggeration intended to shock the common citizen, who had rationalized Shelley into a poet of sentimental love. Some forty years later, in 1944, his complaint against society was still the same: "I submit that when quite respectable young gentlemen like Shelley and myself boast of being heretics, and clubs of them are formed at the universities, Mr Everyman is right in con- cluding that there must be something very wrong somewhere.... When The Inquisition is out-of- date, and the heretics up-to-date, there is the devil to pay."'8 When, in 1892, the ultra-conservative towns- people of Horsham in Sussex celebrated the cen- tennial of their native poet and proposed to build there a Shelley library and museum, Shaw wrote his keenly discerning essay, "Shaming the Devil about Shelley,"'9 to point out what Shelley actu- ally stood for. In it he tells of laughing up his sleeve at the absurdity of any enthusiasm for Shelley in this "true blue" corner of England and proceeds to draw up a statement of the poet's teachings. He points out that in politics Shelley was a most extreme republican, leveler, and radi- cal and was even a Godwinian anarchist until he found this philosophy impracticable. Had Shelley lived fifty years later, he would have been a Social-Democrat with strong leanings toward the most democratic communism attainable and practically workable. In religion Shelley did not resort to calling himself an agnostic to avoid the issue. Though believing strongly in an omnipres- ent life-force, he did not "beg off being an Atheist by calling [it] God, or even Pan." Because of Shelley's unreserved honesty, Shaw was especially incensed by the Horsham celebra- tion which he called "a carnival of humbug," put on primarily by "triflers" who considered Shelley "nothing more than a word-jeweller." Its objec- tive seemed to be to make of Shelley a saint who had unfortunately been thrown in with a bad set ("as if he had not been more free to choose his own set than most other men in England," says Shaw). Shelley's youth, his being a poet, and the elusiveness of his piety unless he was read in the proper spirit were among the excuses made for him. But what, in Shaw's opinion, topped every- thing was Edmund Gosse's contention "that Shelley was so fragile, so irresponsible, so ethere- ally tender, so passionate a creature that the wonder was that he was not a much greater ras- cal." Sarcastically, Shaw says that virtually 14 "Hypochondria," the preface to Heartbreak House, p. 9. Julian Kaye (p. 129, n.) points out that Shaw referred to meat eaters as people who ate corpses and that The Revolt of Islam (v, lv-lvi) indicates a similar opinion on Shelley's part. 16 Shaw, "Shaming the Devil about Shelley," Pen Portraits and Reviews, p. 253. 18 "Epistle Dedicatory," Man and Superman, xxxi-xxxii.

Duerksen 117 every one at the celebration was "solid for the library, even if the front were to be decorated with a relief representing Shelley in a tall hat, Bible in hand, leading his children on Sunday morning to the church of his native parish." In preference to all the humbug at Horsham, Shaw asks that people show some discernment, even if it means saying, "I think Shelley's poetry slovenly and unsubstantial, and his ideas simply rot; but I will celebrate him because he said what he thought, and not what he was expected to say he thought." Instead of attending the Horsham celebration, Shaw took part in the London cen- tennial meeting arranged by G. W. Foote, then president of the National Secular Society. Shaw declares that Mr. Foote, who had been impris- oned for blasphemy, "was able to speak with all the freedom and force of a man who not only talks Shelley but lives him." Of his own part in the program Shaw says, "I had nothing to do but give a faithful account of Shelley's real opinions, with every one of which I unreservedly agree." Most of the people attending Mr. Foote's meet- ing acknowledged a considerable influence of Shelley on their lives. Upon mention of Shelley as a major inspirer of the Chartist movement, an old Chartist in the audience rose to state that he now recalled that reading Shelley had led him to join the movement. Queen Mab's reputation as the Chartists' Bible was then pointed out; and Shaw, writing about the meeting, says of Shelley, "He made and is still making men and women join political societies, Secular societies, Vege- tarian societies, societies for the loosening of the marriage contract, and Humanitarian societies of all sorts." Throughout his life, Shaw continued to be as enthusiastic about this genuine influence of Shelley as he was contemptuous of false Shelley societies and of the Horsham meeting's mouthing of insincere platitudes about Shelley. Being independent of the market for his liter- ary productions, Shelley could afford to ignore much of the public indignation over his unortho- dox views and actions. Because he, nevertheless, knew the value of money, he was, in Shaw's opinion, a practical man.20 And Shaw sees in Shelley's fierce attacks upon his society an ex- ample of the nineteenth century loathing itself after tiring of its money.2' Yet, in a letter to Frank Harris, Shaw recognizes that the Shelley "who poured the fiercest invective on Castle- reagh, on Eldon and on his own father, not to mention the entire tribe of old men," was the same Shelley who wrote Prometheus Unbound and Laon and Cythna, in which kindness and forgiveness are predominant.22 Repeatedly, it becomes evident that the consistency Shaw found so praiseworthy in Shelley was a consistency in speaking out in favor of truth and against false- hood as he saw them. Not that Shaw was invariably pleased with Shelley's poetry. There are aspects of it which he finds superfluous and damaging to the poet's effectiveness. "Shelley," he says, "could not write a big poem without smothering it under a universe of winds and clouds, mountains and fountains, glories and promontories ... until its theme was lost like a roseleaf in a splendid sun- set."23 He appreciates Shelley the agitator far more than Shelley the poet. As a dedicated Fabian, Shaw examines poetry for its socialistic content rather than for its artis- try. With the poet who writes for the sake of sound and rhythm, he contrasts the one who considers poetry only a means to an end, "the end being to deliver a message which clamors to be revealed through him. So he secures a hearing for it by clothing it with word-garments of such beauty, authority, and eternal memorableness, that the world must needs listen to it. These are prophets rather than poets; and for the sake of being poets alone would not take the trouble to rhyme love and dove or bliss and kiss."24 Con- tinuing, Shaw designates Shelley as one of these prophets. When Shelley permits his poetry to obscure his maxims, he disturbs and irritates Shaw. In the minutes of the 13 April 1887 meet- ing of the Shelley Society, Shaw is reported to have maintained, in his rebuttal to a paper on The Revolt of Islam, that "a poem ought to be didactic, and ought to be in the nature of a po- litical treatise"-because poetry is "the most artistic way of teaching those things which a poet ought to teach."25 He considers Queen Mab far superior to The Cenci because it shows Shelley's "remarkable grasp of facts" and his anticipation of a modern view of social amelioration.26 He likes the didacticism of The Revolt and the fac- tualness of Queen Mab and, therefore, thinks them great. No doubt, he recognized their poetic 20 Winsten, Days with Bernard Shaw, p. 271. 21 Shaw, Our Theatres in the Nineties, iii, p. 188. 22 Letter of January 1917.

At the vegetarian banquet held to commemorate the Shelley Centenary, Shaw "regretted that Shelley's artistic excellence, now beyond question, overshadowed his importance as a leader of thought."

Discussing The Cenci, Shaw expresses a forth- right opinion on the relation between content and poetic form: "The Cenci might either have been a serious drama or might never have been written at all if Shelley had not been allowed to carry off its unreality by Elizabethan versification."27 His opinion is that Shelley, like Shakespeare, was not hampered by the convention of writing dramas in verse but found it to be the easiest and cheapest way of composing them. Though Shaw is here dealing with dramatic effect, one suspects that for him the adequate expression of sociological ideas is a factor at least closely related to drama- tic effect. A lack of purpose is the primary charge he is reported to have brought against The Cenci in his remarks at the Shelley Society: "Mr. G. Bernard Shaw said that in his opinion The Cenci was a play unworthy of the genius of Shelley. It was simply an abomination, an accumulation of horrors partaking of the nature of a tour deforce, and probably written by Shelley merely to satisfy his ambition of producing something for the stage. He considered it as bad a piece of work as a man of Shelley's genius could be capable of, so bad indeed that it was hardly worth discus- sion."28 Other comments by Shaw about the play, at the same meeting and later in his writings, indicate that on poetic and dramatic bases alone he would not have made his harsh pronounce- ments against it. The play's major fault, in Shaw's opinion, is that its poetic form diverts from it some of the force of social criticism which it could have realized fully in prose form. Despite his criticisms of The Cenci, Shaw uses the banning of it from British theaters as a weapon in his battle against the censorship code. He describes the Shelley Society's circumvention of the censor in its "private" production of The Cenci as well as the censors' subsequent treat- ment of the theater owner in whose building the play was presented.29 Repeatedly he refers to Shelley's life and writings when he is pointing out the absurdity and inconsistency of censorship as practiced in England.30 Shaw's major disagreement with Shelley con- cerns ideas about love, especially those expressed in Epipsychidion. He wrote to Frank Harris that love poems generally "are like Shelley's Epipsy- chidion, irritating to terre a terre sensual women, who know at once that you are making them palatable by pretending they are something that they are not, and cannot stand comparison with."'" Having declared, "It is a scientific fact that some of the.primitive impulses which existed before the invention of language remain unspeak- able and should be gratified in silence," Shaw pronounces Shelley's Epipsychidion "a wonderful effort by a supreme master of language to utter the unspeakable; but the result is a rhapsody of nonsense that has no contact with natural his- tory."32 Comparing Epipsychidion to the one great love poem of the Bible, Shaw declares Shelley's poem to be "literary gas and gaiters."33 Shaw objects not only to Shelley's expression of sexual love but also to his advocacy of uni- versal love as the answer to all human problems. Ibsen, he says, does not find Shelley's "brimstone conception, 'the Almighty Fiend'," to be worth attacking-partly because the cultured class to which Ibsen addressed himself had replaced that superstition with "the sentimental religion of love in which we are still wallowing, and which only substitutes twaddle for terror."34 Discussing Wagner's Nibelungs' Ring, Shaw maintains that the musician-dramatist's philosophy was ex- hausted before he had completed the work. To arrive at his solution in the drama of Wotan and Siegfried, WVagner "succumbed to the panacea mania . . . like any of the rest of us." Shaw con- tinues: The panacea is by no means an original one. XVagner was anticipated in the year 1819 by a young country gentleman from Sussex named Shelley, in a work of extraordinary artistic power and splendor. Prometheus Unbound is an English attempt at a Ring.... Both works set forth the same conflict between humanity and its gods and governments, issuing in the redemp- tion of man from their tyranny by the growth of his will into perfect strength and self-confidence; and both finish by a lapse into panacea-mongering didac- ticism by the holding up of Love as the remedy for all evils and the solvent of all social difficulties.35 27 The Perfect Wagnerite, p. 275. 28 The Shelley Society, Publications, ser. 1, no. 2, pt. 1, pp. 184-185. Perhaps noteworthy in this regard is Shaw's post- card to Sylva Norman, in which he cautioned her about the reporting of the Shelley Society, stating that he himself had been among those suffering most severely from its inaccura- cies. See her Flight of the Skylark (London, 1954), p. 272, n. 29 "The Censorship of the Stage in England,"; see West, pp. 71-72, 77; see also Appendix to The Quintessence of Ibsenism (West, p. 11).

Duerksen 119 Wagner, as Shaw understands him, reduces to an absurdity the Shelleyan concept of a love pan- acea. He presents love's supreme good as being its complete satisfaction of life, removing the troublesome power of the "Will to Live" and finally contenting us with the "highest happiness of death." Shelley's idea of love as a sentiment of affectionate benevolence (better expressed as mercy and kindness) with no connotation of sexual passion, frees him, in Prometheus Un- bound, from the need to reduce his panacea to Wagner's absurdity. Wagner, says Shaw, always insisting on the need to apprehend sensually in order "to give reality to abstract comprehen- sion," followed poetic love "back to its alleged origin in sexual passion." The frankness and naturalism of his musical expression of this pas- sion "would possibly have scandalized Shelley."36 But Shaw finds that even Shelley's idea of mercy and loving-kindness does not hold good as a universal law of conduct. He points out that Shelley himself makes extremely short work of Jupiter. Bringing in "that very nebulous per- sonification of Eternity called Demogorgon" to save Prometheus from doing the actual destruc- tive work, does not, in Shaw's opinion, save the situation at all. He argues that because there is no such person as Demogorgon, no one will pull down Jupiter if Prometheus does not do so him- self. The error in Shaw's reasoning is immediately apparent. He insists that Jupiter must be pulled down by a "person" and that literal destructive work must be done. There are no such persons either, it might be pointed out, as Prometheus and Jupiter. Shelley is saying that tyranny can be overcome by unpersonified forces put in mo- tion by an application of the ethic of love; he insists that destructive action is unnecessary and evil. Yet, sharply though Shaw attacks both Shelley and Wagner for what he considers their lapse into panacea mongering, he also mentions them to- gether in terms of highest praise. In his preface to Misalliance (1910) he makes a comparison highly favorable to the very works whose respective conclusions he so severely criticized in 1898: "The pleasure we get from the rhetoric of the book of Job and its tragic picture of a bewildered soul cannot . . . supply the need for such modern revelations as Shelley's Prometheus or The Nib- lung's [sic] Ring of Richard Wagner."37 And he had, some years before The Perfect Wagnerite, singled out these two men as examples of the heights which may be attained when "high think- ing" is the norm in a person's life: In this century the world has produced two men- Shelley and Wagner-in whom intense poetic feeling was the permanent state of their consciousness, and who were certainly not restrained by any religious, conventional, or prudential considerations from in- dulging themselves to the utmost of their opportuni- ties. Far from being gluttonous, drunken, cruel, or de- bauched, they were apostles of vegetarianism and water-drinking; had an utter horror of violence and "sport"; were notable champions of the independence of women; and were, in short, driven into open revo- lution against the social evils which the average sen- sual man finds extremely suitable to him. So much is this the case that the practical doctrine of these two arch-voluptuaries always presents itself to ordinary persons as a saint-like asceticism.38 And this early praise was to be followed by vari- ous references to Shelley, expressing a high ad- miration-at times almost an adoration-of Shelley's social and political leadership, high seriousness, and moral greatness. In the preface to Man and Superman (1903) Shaw referred to Shelley as "a religious force."39 And to Stephen Winsten he once, in his old age, said, "I am highly susceptible to the force of all truly religious music, especially to the music of my own church, the church of Shelley, Michel- angelo, and Beethoven."40 This high commenda- tion Shaw accords to Shelley because he considers the poet to have attained the advanced level of being which is the province of supermen. John Tanner's "Revolutionist's Handbook," appended to Man and Superman, contains the following observation: "Unless we are replaced by a more highly evolved animal-in short, by the Super- man-the world must remain a den of dangerous animals among whom our few accidental super- men, our Shakespears, Goethes, Shelleys, and their like, must live as precariously as lion tamers do.' 41 But in attaining his position as a superman, Shelley has not removed himself from the scene of 36 Ibid., p. 232. 37 "Parents and Children," the preface to Misalliance, p. 99. 38 "The Religion of the Pianoforte," Fortnightly Rev., LV, n.s. (1 February 1894), 264. 39 "Epistle Dedicatory" to Man and Superman, p. xiv. 40 Winsten, Days with Bernard Shaw, p. 113. Shaw's re- sponse, at the 8 June 1887 meeting of the Shelley Society, to Mr. Edward Silsbee's untitled paper on Shelley, is pertinent here: "Mr. Bernard Shaw said the paper seemed to him a sort of act of worship, and he dreaded all criticism that had not a basis of reason. It seemed to him that Shelley does produce irrationally enthusiastical phenomena, which Dante and Shakespeare do not." See Shelley Society, Publications, ser. 1, no. 2, pt. 2. See also Henderson, p. 152. Quite obviously, Shaw himself was tempted more by Shelley than by Shake- speare and Dante to become irrationally enthusiastic. 41 Man and Superman, p. 207.</page><page sequence="7">120 Shelley and Shaw social needs and conflicts. Having cited Morris, Ruskin, and Carlyle as writers who turned from aesthetic interests to revolutionary writings, Shaw designates these men as followers of Shel- ley. They realized that, since nobody else was taking up the challenge of the social misery all about them, they as great writers must. Like Shelley, poets must work for public improvement at the stages at which such work will bring them only abuse.42 There is, however, another way of looking at the advanced work done by great writers and artists who catch the vision of a bet- ter future for mankind. Presenting them as build- ing their pinnacles till they catch the glint of the unrisen sun, thus to reflect its rays to the waiting people, Shaw conjectures about the advanced state of our being when the sun that is caught by the work of great artists such as Shelley shall have reached the valleys.43 He makes it clear that one of the praiseworthy aspects of Shelley is his ability to draw other great men after him to serve mankind as social prophets. Shaw thus pictures Shelley as a man of utter seriousness; comparing him to Keats, he admits that "even the thought of Shelley kills genial- ity." 44 But, in an appendix to The Quintessence of lbsenism, he has given noble reasons for Shelley's high seriousness: It was not through joyless poverty of soul that Shelley never laughed, but through an enormous ap- prehension and realization of the gravity of things that seemed mere fun to other men.... The English cry of "Amuse us: take things easily: dress up the world prettily for us" seems mere cowardice to the strong souls that dare look facts in the face; and just so far as people cast off levity and idolatry they find them- selves able to bear the company of Bunyan and Shelley, of Ibsen and Strindberg and the great Russian realists, and unable to tolerate the sort of laughter that African tribes cannot restrain when a man is flogged or an animal trapped and wounded.45 One needs, of course, only to read Shelley's youthful The Devil's Walk, and his Oedipus Tyrannus, to know that it is not literally true that, as poet, he never laughed. Shaw is referring to the undercurrent of serious intent always present in Shelley's works. In The Quintessence of Ibsenism Shaw declares, "The salvation of the world depends on the men who will not take evil good-humoredly, and whose laughter destroys the fool instead of encouraging him."46 Then fol- lows the already-quoted passage on the cause of Shelley's seriousness. This intense seriousness has much in common with Shaw's view of his own great wit as primarily a device for seeking and exposing truth. Shelley's tendency to see the gravity of what to others seemed mere fun and his simultaneous ability to look facts in the face caused Shaw to declare him a pioneer. In The Quintessence of Ibsenism, Shaw presents two kinds of pioneers: the one who looks back and pronounces wrong something that nobody has considered wrong, and the one who declares that it is right to do something previously considered infamous. By two propositions which Shelley upheld, Shaw presents him as an example of both kinds of pio- neer: (1) "It is wrong to kill animals and eat them," and (2) "It is not wrong to take your sister as your wife."47 There is nothing new, Shaw points out, in the reformer's defiance of duty; for every step of progress a duty is repudiated and a scripture torn up. Denunciation by society is, therefore, the natural lot of the reformer. Among his examples Shaw lists the accusation against Shelley as a libertine. Despite this ostracism by society, the solitary Shelleyan pioneer, seeing truths which lie deeper than surface platitudes, is the unrecognized benefactor of mankind. Setting up an imaginary society of one thou- sand, Shaw classifies its members as 700 Philis- tines and 299 idealists, thus leaving one man unclassified. This is the man with strength enough to face the truth which the idealists shirk. Shaw calls him the realist. To gain a clear under- standing of his terms, as well as to see how Shel- ley figures as his model for the realist, we must turn to Shaw's own words: The Philistines will simply think him [the realist] mad. But the idealists will be terrified beyond measure at the proclamation of their hidden thought.... They will crucify him, burn him, violate their own ideals of family affection by taking his children away from him, ostracize him, brand him as immoral, profligate, filthy, and appeal against him to the despised Philis- 42 "The Problem Play-A Symposium," in West, pp. 64-65.

At the 8 June 1887 meeting of the Shelley Society, Shaw "contended that . . . Shelley had a large fund of humor, but the fact of taking so serious a view of life and life's work kept the humor away from his poetry." See Shelley Society, Publications, ser. 1, no. 2, pt. 2. 46 The Quintessence of Ibsenism, p. 143, 47 Ibid., p. 15. In a footnote Shaw declares the second proposition both unimportant and old-fashioned. He com- pares it to the proposition, "It is not wrong to stand on one's head"; to which the reply is, "You may be very right; but as nobody wants to, why bother about it?" Yet he believes that Shelley has helped to bring about the modern, sensible way of treating the matter-an obvious improvement over the old morbid horror.</page><page sequence="8">Roland A. Duerksen 121 tines, specially idealized for the occasion as Society. ... Take the case of ... Shelley. The idealists did not call Shelley a cynic: they called him a fiend until they invented a new illusion to enable them to enjoy the beauty of his lyrics, this illusion being nothing less than the pretence that since he was at bottom an idealist himself, his ideals must be identical with those of Tennyson and Longfellow, neither of whom ever wrote a line in which some highly respectable ideal was not implicit. Here the admission that Shelley, the realist, was an idealist too, seems to spoil the whole argument.... You and I, reader, will be at cross purposes at every sentence unless you allow me to distinguish pioneers like Shelley and Ibsen as realists from the idealists of my imaginary community of one thousand.... If the term realist is objected to on account of its modern associations, I can only recommend you, if you must associate it with something else than my own descrip- tion of its meaning (I do not deal in definitions), to associate it, not with Zola and Maupassant, but with Plato.48 What angers Shaw most is that, not the igno- rant and stupid, but the literate and cultured maintain the error of confounding the highest man with the lowest. Among other examples, he points out: "It is from men of established literary reputation that we learn that William Blake was mad, that Shelley was spoiled by living in a low set."49 His own admiration for Shelley's social and political leadership, seriousness, and moral greatness intensifies Shaw's characteristic disdain for the society of idealists and Philistines. In his dramas themselves Shaw does not fre- quently quote from or refer directly to Shelley. But in Candida the character of the poet Eugene Marchbanks is obviously patterned after Shelley, although Shelley is not specifically mentioned in the play. When Candida is studied in conjunction with The Quintessence, there can be little doubt of Shaw's intention to set forth Marchbanks as an example of the Shelleyan realist whom he has presented in the essay. The playwright's descrip- tion of Marchbanks is, in itself, a resume (with added Shavian touches) of the accounts generally given of Shelley's person and temperament: He is a strange, shy youth . . . slight, effeminate, with a delicate childish voice, and a hunted tormented ex- pression and shrinking manner that shew the painful sensitiveness of very swift and acute apprehensiveness in youth.... The very intensity with which he feels a perfectly commonplace position comes from excessive nervous force; and his nostrils, mouth, and eyes betray a fiercely petulant wilfulness, as to the bent of which his brow, already lined with pity, is reassuring. He is so uncommon as to be almost unearthly; and to prosaic people there is something noxious in this unearthli- ness, just as to poetic people there is something angelic in it.50 And in the early productions of Candida, March- banks was made up to resemble Shelley-"femi- ninely hectic and timid and fierce," in Oliver Elton's words."1 Like Shelley, Marchbanks is misunderstood by his aristocratic family. He, too, as Candida tells us near the end of the play, has been miserable at Eton, has left Oxford, and is resisting his father's attempt to starve him into returning to school. His insistence upon a showdown between his ideas and those of his opponents, and his aversion to Morell's "metaphors, sermons, stale perora- tions," are distinctly Shelleyan traits. In Candida Shelley and Shelleyan ideas figure more promi- nently than in any other of Shaw's dramatic works. One other play which obviously had its incep- tion in a Shelleyan idea is Captain Brassbound's Conversion. Shaw originally entitled it The Witch of Atlas, and although its name was changed, the play appears none the less to be based upon Shelley's poem. It contains one verbal assurance that Shelley's Witch of Atlas was in Shaw's mind as he wrote: SIR HOWARD. What are those hills over there to the southeast? RANKIN. They are the outposts, so to speak, of the Atlas Mountains. LADY CICELY. The Atlas Mountains! Where Shelley's witch lived! We'll make an excursion to them tomorrow.52 And it is in these hills that Lady Cicely, by the charm of her innocent and absolute disbelief in the threat of violence and revenge, converts the arrogant ruffian Brassbound. Had Shaw chosen to supply his play with a motto, he could scarcely have found one more suitable than Shelley's lines: 48 Ibid., pp. 31-33. 49 Ibid., pp. 33-34. The misleading statement about Shelley was one of Matthew Arnold's declarations. See also Pen Portraits and Reviews, p. 253. 60 Candida, p. 93. In view of Shaw's frequent citing of Shelley as a specimen of the realist in The Quintessence, it is most surprising to come upon William Irvine's remark that Marchbanks "is perhaps too much Shelley made over to fit the definition of a Shavian realist." See Irvine, The Universe of G.B.S. (New York, 1949), p. 178. 61 See Henderson, p. 443. Note, in Henderson's biography, the photograph of the actor Arnold Daly as Marchbanks (in 1903), reading Shelley's poem, "One word is too oft pro- faned." 62 Captain Brassbound's Conversion (Act i), p. 231. Note that Shaw has earlier used the phrase "witch of Atlas" in his first novel Immaturity (written in 1879), p. 350.</page><page sequence="9">122 Shelley and Shaw The magic circle of her voice and eyes All savage natures did imparadise. (Witch of Atlas, 11. 103-104) Shelley's witch, like Lady Cicely, introduces a new spirit of confidence, trust, and selflessness into a world which knows only the old codes of fear, aggression, and revenge. Other instances in Shaw's plays of direct refer- ence to Shelley appear to be of a more incidental kind. Yet it might be argued that two lines of Shelley's Ozymandias- My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye mighty and despair- quoted in Part v of Back to Methuselah by the proud but pathetic MIale Figure, state the theme of the whole play. The former greatness of Shel- ley's Ozymandias has been superseded, his statue has crumbled, and his words have become ab- surd; Shaw pictures the same thing happening to modern man's attainments. Another literary work in which Shaw occasion- ally refers to Shelley is his first novel, Immaturity, which he wrote in 1879 but did not publish until 1930. The character who represents Shaw in the novel is the youthful Smith, who becomes intoler- ant of everything that falls short of his highest ideal of beauty and power and thus contracts prejudices against his early idol Byron, whom he replaces by Shelley. He tries vegetarianism, but this attempt is frustrated in three days by the cook's inability to vary the diet of boiled cab- bage. Especially revealing is Shaw's comment about Smith's early preferences: "He was credu- lous when a reformer pointed out abuses, and sceptical when a conservative defended institu- tions." Motivated by this enthusiasm, he pre- sents the works of Shelley to the rather Philistine Miss Russell. To his great astonishment she re- turns the volume with the comment that it is "a good book, only fit for children.""3 That Shelley was not only a phase with Smith is indicated in a conversation he has, late in the novel, with his friend Isabella: "Do you care for poetry?" [she asks]. "I do not read it very often; so I suppose I do not care for it." "When you do read it, who is your favorite poet?" "Shelley." "Oh! Yes, of course. I always thought Shelley a little old-fashioned; and there are so many of his poems which it is not right to read." "Too irreligious?" "Oh dear, no! I am not in the least prejudiced; and one is accustomed to that sort of thing in poetry. But I think it is possible for a poet to be too imaginative. Shelley's sensuality marred everything he wrote." Smith stared at her without attempting a reply.54 His consistency of enthusiasm for Shelley is one of Smith's most Shavian characteristics. If any one idea predominates in Shaw's works, it is his passionate antagonism toward all parti- san thinking which imposes its will upon others by physical coercion. Shaw abhors tyranny, hate, cruelty, and especially the principle of retribution and revenge. It was the Socialist revival of the early eighties which finally drew him out of an eight-year period of comparative solitude that he had imposed upon himself shortly after coming to London from his native Dublin. What attracted him to the company of Englishmen involved in the Socialist movement was not only their intense seriousness and burning indignation at real and fundamental evils affecting the whole world but also the fact that their reaction against these evils "bound the finer spirits of all the nations together instead of making them cherish hatred of one another as a national virtue."55 Before becoming an active Socialist, Shaw was saturated with the writings of Shelley; the con- clusion is unavoidable that Shelley stirred up in him that spirit which found its true affinity among those who sought to resolve problems and differences by means other than vengeance and aggression. It is the spirit which pervades The Revolt of Islam, Prometheus Unbound, The Witch of Atlas, and the choruses of Hellas. But nowhere does Shelley more pointedly and unreservedly express his views on the vindictive use of power than in his Essay on Christianity, in which he argues that the opinions of Christ on this subject have been most unfortunately disregarded. The main point of the essay is stated concisely in one of its sentences: "Jesus Christ instructed his disciples to be perfect as their father in Heaven is perfect, declaring at the same time his belief that human perfection requires the refraining from revenge or retribution in any of its various shapes."56 The primary ideas in An Essay on 53 Immaturity, pp. 57, 58. 54 Ibid., p. 399.

Duerksen 123 Christianity are the very ones which constitute a major theme of Shaw's preface to Androcles and the Lion. In numerous other works, also, Shaw empha- sizes the evil inherent in romanticizing, systema- tizing, and institutionalizing the urge for ven- geance and of giving it glorified names such as justice and honor. The folly of such false codes is the central theme of Captain Brassbound's Con- version, and it is clearly set forth in the essay on "Imprisonment." Among other works in which the same theme figures with some prominence are Arms and the Man, Heartbreak House, and Misal- liance. But in no other drama does Shaw present his vehemence against codified, judicially-sanc- tioned retribution in a more concentrated and extreme manner than in the following scene from Caesar and Cleopatra (Rufio, revealing to Caesar that it is Cleopatra's woman servant Ftatateeta who has killed Pothinus, whom Caesar had promised safe conduct, is telling what he has done about it): RUFIO. Why, Cleopatra had a tigress that killed men at her bidding. I thought she might bid it kill you some day. Well, had I not been Ceasar's pupil, what pious things might I not have done to that tigress! I might have punished it. I might have revenged Pothinus on it. CAESAR. [interjects] Pothinus! RUFIO. [continuing] I might have judged it. But I put all these follies behind me; and, without malice, only cut its throat. And that is why Cleopatra comes to you in mourning. CLEOPATRA. [vehemently] He has shed the blood of my servant Ftatateeta. On your head be it as upon his, Caesar, if you hold him free of it. CAESAR. [energetically] On my head be it, then; for it was well done. Rufio: had you set yourself in the seat of the judge, and with hateful ceremonies and appeals to the gods handed that woman over to some hired executioner to be slain before the people in the name of justice, never again would I have touched your hand without a shudder. But this was a natural slaying: I feel no horror at it. 57 Shaw, of course, is not seriously proposing the anarchy which would result if Rufio's method became general practice.58 He is using his favorite device of presenting an extreme and exaggerated case in order to shock society into action. In 1915 Shaw wrote his essay on Christianity and prefixed it, under the title "Preface on the Prospects of Christianity," to Androcles and the Lion. That he relied primarily on Shelley's Essay on Christianity as a source for those portions dealing with man's vindictiveness and clannish pugnacity is a conclusion difficult to avoid. He singles out, as distinctive of Christ's teachings, the same doctrines which Shelley has singled out: the superiority of universal love over family bonds and nationalism, the advisability of com- munistic life, the necessity to abandon revenge and punishment as ways of dealing with crime, and the futility and wickedness of power politics. A series of parallel passages from the respective essays of the two writers will serve to elucidate the close agreement between Shelley's and Shaw's views on these doctrines. Shelley speaks out plainly and inclusively on the subject of family loyalty and nationalism: Those distinctions which have been artificially set up of nations and cities, and families and religions are only general names expressing the abhorrence and contempt with which men blindly consider their fellow- men. I love my country, I love the city in which I was born, my parents and my wife and the children of my care, and to this city this woman and this nation, it is incumbent on me to do all the benefit in my power. -To what do these distinctions point, but to an in- direct denial of the duty which humanity imposes on you of doing every possible good, to every individual, under whatever denomination he may be compre- hended, to whom you have the power of doing it? You ought to love all mankind, nay, every individual of mankind; you ought not to love the individuals of your domestic circle less, but to love those who exist beyond it, more. (p. 245) And Shaw declares that Jesus advocates communism, the widening of the private family with its cramping ties into the great family of mankind under the fatherhood of God, the abandon- ment of revenge and punishment, the counteracting of evil by good instead of by hostile evil, and an organic conception of society in which you are not an inde- pendent individual but a member of society, your neighbor being another member, and each of you members one of another, as two fingers on a hand, the obvious conclusion being that unless you love your neighbor as your self and he reciprocates you will both be the worse for it.59 57 Caesar and Cleopatra (Act v), p. 200. 68 See Thze Perfect Wagnerite, pp. 235-236, where Shaw asserts that, to avoid the unprogressive fate of China, a na- tion must have anarchists, but that the anarchism must be limited to the sphere of thought. Our criminal law, he con- tinues, is the outgrowth of "our vindictiveness and cruelty in a virtuous disguise," and its own evil and uselessness will eventually beat this "unmitigated and abominable nuisance" out of us. Shaw predicts that it will not be replaced by anarchy, but that a much higher degree of social action will need to be exerted in order to bring about an appreciable change in the established system. 59 Preface to Androcles and the Lion, p. 24. Hereafter, page references to this preface are made parenthetically after quotations.</page><page sequence="11">124 Shelley and Shaw Later in the preface, Shaw makes a numerical listing of doctrines in which he finds Jesus to be confirmed. Some excerpts from several of these doctrines are: "If you let a child starve you are letting God starve.... Love your enemies: they are your neighbors. . . Get rid of your family entanglements. Every mother you meet is as much your mother as the woman who bore you. Every man you meet is as much your brother as the man she bore after you" (p. 51).6? The subject of widening the scope of family and neighborhood is not far removed from that of communal living. Shelley's comment in this regard is: "With all those who are truly wise, there will be an entire community, not only of thoughts and feelings, but also of external posses- sions. Insomuch therefore as ye love one- another, ye may enjoy the community of whatsoever benefits arise from the inventions of civilized life" (p. 245). Shaw, who has earlier in the essay ap- plied the term "communism" to the concept of "the great family of mankind," makes use of the same term in what appears to be an elaboration on Shelley's statement. In large cornmunities, where even the most eccentric demands for manufactured articles average themselves out until they can be foreseen within a negligible margin of error, direct communism (Take what you want without payment, as the people do in Morris's News From Nowhere) will, after a little experience, be found not only practicable but highly economical to an extent that now seems impossible. The sports- men, the musicians, the physicists, the biologists will get their apparatus for the asking as easily as their bread, or, as at present, their paving, street lighting, and bridges; and the deaf man will not object to con- tribute to communal flutes when the musician has to contribute to communal ear trumpets. (p. 63) Coming to the heart of his argument, Shelley analyzes the passion for revenge. He points out its underlying assumptions, its inevitable system- atization, and its futility: My neighbor or my servant or my child has done me an injury, and it is just that he should suffer an injury in return. Such is the doctrine which Jesus Christ sum- moned his whole resources of persuasion to oppose. "Love your enemy, bless those who curse you." . . . Pain has been inflicted, therefore pain should be in- flicted in return. Retaliation is the only remedy which can be applied to violence, because it teaches the injurer the true nature of his own conduct, and oper- ates as a warning against its repetition, . , . Such rea- sonings and the impetuous feelings arising from them have armed nation against nation, family against family, man against man.... The emptiness and folly of retaliation is apparent from every example which can be brought forward. (pp. 233, 237, 238) Shaw's analysis is very similar to Shelley's, as is his view of the acceptance by society of venge- ance and retaliation as norms of behavior. He develops the same points Shelley has made: The primitive idea of justice is partly legalized revenge and partly expiation by sacrifice. It works out from both sides in the notion that two blacks make a white, and that when a wrong has been done, it should be paid for by an equivalent suffering. It seems to the Philistine majority a matter of course that this com- pensating suffering should be inflicted on the wrong- doer for the sake of its deterrent effect on other would- be wrongdoers; but a moment's reflection will shew that this utilitarian application corrupts the whole transaction.... I have only to point out that we have been judging and punishing ever since Jesus told us not to; and I defy anyone to make out a convincing case for believing that the world has been any better than it would have been if there had never been a judge, a prison, or a gallows in all that time. We have simply added the misery of punishment to the misery of crime, and the cruelty of the judge to the cruelty of the criminal. We have taken the bad man, and made him worse by torture and degradation, incidentally making ourselves worse in the process. It does not seem very sensible, does it? (pp. 12-13, 66) Shelley's attitude toward capital punishment is expressed in his fragmentary essay On the Punishment of Death. He points out that the infliction of death usually imparts some pain and terror but that, "as a measure of punishment, strictly so considered, and as an exhibition, which, by its known effects on the sensibility of the sufferer, is intended to intimidate the specta- tors from incurring a similar liability, it is singu- larly inadequate." He comments on the reactions of the spectators: "The spectators who feel no abhorrence at a public execution, but rather a self-applauding superiority, and a sense of grati- fied indignation, are surely excited to the most inauspicious emotions."6' And, writing after the abolition of public executions, Shaw, in the ap- pendix to Androcles and the Lion, declares the principle of capital punishment, as well as the emotions it elicits, to have remained unchanged: "Now that we may no longer see a man hanged, we assemble outside the jail to see the black flag run up. That is our duller method of enjoying ourselves in the old Roman spirit. And if the Government decided to throw persons of unpop- ular or eccentric views to the lions in the Albert 60 In view of his advocacy of love for both neighbor and enemy, Shaw may be called to task for his attack upon Shelley and Wagner as succumbing to panacea-mongering when they present universal love as the answer to man's problems.

Duerksen 125 Hall or the Earl's Court stadium tomorrow, can you doubt that all the seats would be crammed, mostly by people who could not give you the most superficial account of the views in ques- tion.M62 Shelley and Shaw agree that theology has op- posed, rather than supported, the doctrines of Christ. In the Essay on Christianity Shelley states: "Jesus Christ expressly asserts that dis- tinction between the good and evil principle which it has been the practice of all theologians to confound. How far his doctrines, or their inter- pretations, may be true, it would scarcely have been worth while to enquire, if the one did not afford an example and an incentive to the attain- ment of true virtue, whilst the other holds out a sanction and apology for every species of mean and cruel vice" (p. 240). Shaw's Preface indicts all states and churches: "The glaring contradic- tion between [Jesus's] teaching and the practice of all the States and all the Churches is no longer hidden. And it may be that . . . though his Church has not yet been founded nor his political system tried, the bankruptcy of all other systems . . . is driving us hard into accepting him, not as a scapegoat, but as one who was much less of a fool in practical matters than we have hitherto all thought him" (pp. 86-87).63 Supporting his contention that all other systems have suffered bankruptcy, Shaw asserts: "Luther, who made a clean sweep of all the saints with their million miracles, and reduced the Blessed Virgin herself to the status of an idol, concentrated Salvation- ism to a point at which the most execrable mur- derer who believes in it when the rope is round his neck, flies straight to the arms of Jesus, whilst Tom Paine and Shelley fall into the bottomless pit to burn there to all eternity" (p. 88).4 Applying their argument to the history of international politics, both writers agree that the doctrines of Christ have not been given a fair trial by the nations of the world. The basic simi- larity of the respective comments by Shelley and Shaw on this point is obvious: Jesus Christ opposed with earnest eloquence the panic fears and hateful superstitions which have enslaved mankind for ages. Nations had risen against nations employing the subtilest devices of mechanism and mind to waste and excruciate and overthrow.... If all the thought which had been expended on the con- struction of engines of agony and death, the modes of aggression and defence, the raising of armies, and the acquirement of those arts of tyranny and falsehood without which mixed multitudes deluded and goaded to mutual ruin could neither be led nor governed, had been employed to promote the true welfare, and ex- tend the real empire of man how different would have been the present situation of human society! (pp. 236-238) The moneyed, respectable, capable world has been steadily anti-Christian and Barabbasque [Shaw's term for an inclination to choose the criminal Barabbas in preference to Christ] since the crucifixion; and the specific doctrine of Jesus has not in all that time been put into political or general social practice.... I am ready to admit that after contemplating the world and human nature for nearly sixty years, I see no way out of the world's misery but the way which would have been found by Christ's will if he had undertaken the work of a modern practical statesman. (p. 3) The parallel quotation of the above excerpts provides evidence that Shaw was in full agree- ment with Shelley on the subjects of revenge and coercion and that Shelley's essay may have been the direct source for Shaw's treatment of these subjects in the preface to A ndrocles and the Lion, as Shelley's On the Punishment of Death may have served for Shaw's appendix to the play. Yet Shaw, at a first reading, appears to be much less certain than Shelley that man, without the aid of a great evolutionary "jump," can achieve a society based on Christ's principles. In Part Iv of Back to Methuselah we are shown the England of about 3,000 A.D., a society of people who have mastered the art of living for three hundred years. An elderly gentleman has come with his son-in-law, the Envoy, from the south- ern land to which all short-lived people have been exiled, to consult the oracle in England. He con- 8 Appendix to Androcles and the Lion, p. 152. 03 Another parallel passage from Shelley is found in his fragment, The Moral Teachings of Jesus Christ (Works, VI, 255): "This alone would be a demonstration of the falsehood of Christianity, that the religion so called is the strongest ally and bulwark of that system of successful force and fraud and of the selfish passions from which it has derived its origin and permanence, against which Jesus Christ declared the most uncompromising war, and the extinction of which appears to have been the great motive of his life.... Doctrines of reform were never carried to so great a length as by Jesus Christ." "4 In his preface to Back to Methuselah (p. xxxix) Shaw again expounds this very point: "People at large could not conceive a god who was not anthropomorphic: they stood by the Old Testament legends of a God whose parts had been seen by one of the patriarchs, and finally set up as against the Church a God who, far from being without body, parts, or passions, was composed of nothing else, and of very evil passions too. They imposed this idol in practice on the Church itself, in spite of the First Article, and thereby homeopathi- cally produced the atheist, whose denial of God was simply a denial of the idol and a demonstration against an unbearable and most unchristian idolatry. The idol was, as Shelley had been expelled from Oxford for pointing out, an almighty fiend, with a petty character and unlimited power, spiteful, cruel, jealous, vindictive, and physically violent."</page><page sequence="13">126 Shelley and Shaw verses with Zoo, the long-lived nurse who has been assigned to care for him: THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN.

They had actually to kill one another for preaching their own gospel, or be killed themselves.65 Later in the same part of the play, the Envoy consults Zoo and displays an aspect of human nature which accounts for Shaw's apparent pes- simism, as reflected in Zoo's reply.

You will then begin all over again as half-starved ignorant savages, and fight with boomerangs and poisoned arrows until you work up to the poison gases and high explosives once more, with the same result.66 As early as 1898, Shaw had presented his view of possible alternatives regarding the future of mankind. If human nature, the highest form of life we know, is really degenerating, he contends in The Perfect Wagnerite, then the decay of soci- ety is inevitable, and it cannot possibly be saved by "panic-begotten penal measures." Setting to work, like Prometheus, to make new men, instead of vainly imposing tortuous reforms upon old ones, is then our duty. But if, on the other hand, human nature, carried upward by the energy of life, is still attaining progressively higher levels, then the hopes of the world brighten with every additional young person who derides and discards the pet institutions of his elders. What appears to be a growth of anarchy, says Shaw, in reality serves to measure the rate of improvement. He illustrates by citing the likely reaction of a snail to any evolution which threatens to eliminate shells. The snail sees in this threat the prospect of general death from exposure; nevertheless, the most elaborately housed beings are born with neither shell, fur, nor feathers.67 But Back to Methuselah is not necessarily Shaw's assertion that the first alternative he had presented in 1898 has proven to be the only one left for mankind. Shaw must always be granted his hypothesis; the word if bears great weight in his theories. Back to Methuselah would, therefore, seem to be his prophecy regarding the only hope for man's salvation if human nature really is degenerating. Basically, Shaw prefers the view which sees human nature continuing its upward climb; and he detects various evidences of creative evolution at work in the nineteenth century. On the two previous centuries of "ignorant Bible worship and shameless commercialism" he blames the degeneration of the Englishman's God into the almighty fiend Jupiter whom Shelley found it necessary to attack. Shelley's Demogorgon, who overthrows Jupiter, has since been replaced, Shaw asserts, by the concept of evolution; and the almighty fiend has become more nearly Wagner's Wotan, who is himself the father of the truth and heroism which eventually bring about his overthrow (in which overthrow he finally acquiesces). In Shelley's later works, Shaw sees indications of a progress toward Wagner's more tolerant view.68 The acceptance of the theory of evolution is, to Shaw, a notable indication that society can quite rapidly discard old concepts for new. The problem is in the tendency immediately to be- come conservative and defensive about the new concepts, as Shaw demonstrates in his preface to Back to Methuselah (p. xliv): The moment we found that we could do without Shelley's almighty fiend intellectually, he went into the gulf that seemed only a dustbin with a suddenness that made our own lives one of the most astonishing periods in history.... In 1906 I might have vitu- perated Jehovah more heartily than ever Shelley did without eliciting a protest in any circle of thinkers, or shocking any public audience accustomed to modern discussion; but when I described Darwin as "an intel- ligent and industrious pigeon fancier," that blasphem- ous levity, as it seemed, was received with horror and indignation. But that Shaw, despite the dogmatizing that had grown up around Darwin, found in the idea 65 Back to Methusdah (Part iv, Act I), pp. 164-165. 6 Ibid.

Stating that the third act of the play is "a careful attempt to write a new Book of Genesis for the Bible of the Evolutionists," Shaw indi- cates the potential he sees in the new belief. "A religion," he declares, "is nothing but a common view of the nature of will, the purpose of life, the design of organism, and the intention of evolution."69 He believes that in England such a common view is detaching itself from the welter of negation which was brought on by pseudo- Christian religious forms and petty commercial- ism. Shaw's affirmation of hope for mankind is nowhere more positively stated than in his asser- tion: "The time has come for an attempt to formulate this common view as a modern religion, and to provide it with a body of doctrine, a poesy, and a political and industrial system. Shelley and Wagner made notable attempts to provide it with materials for a Bible; and I, with later lights in science to guide me than either of these prophets, have made a further attempt in Man and Superman."70 Shaw recognized his debt to Shelley and con- sciously built upon the base which the poet had provided. Considering Shaw's impulsiveness and his intentionally hyperbolic declarations, we need not be surprised that a few inconsistencies and contradictions should appear among his adapta- tions of Shelleyan ideas. Essentially, Shelley's way of thinking about social concerns appealed to Shaw, and he sought to extend and perfect the ideas Shelley had offered. Different though the two writers are in manner, their philosophies are fundamentally the same. PURDUE UNIVERSITY Lafayette, Ind. 69 Quoted by Rattray, p. 177. 70 Ibid. ERUDITION should naturally be the foundation of all its (criticism's) constructions, erudition leaning on the one hand on history, on philology on the other. And from this as a spring board it will be able boldly to rise to that intimate apprehension of the inner meaning of literary works in all their aspects, historical, psycho- logical, philosophical, and aesthetic, which, as we have seen, is the goal of criticism.-Albert Feuillerat, "Scholarship and Literary Criticism," Yale Review, January 1925.</page></plain_text>
