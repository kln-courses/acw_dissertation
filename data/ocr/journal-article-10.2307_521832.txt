<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Call for Rationalism: "Arab Averroists" in the Twentieth Century Anke von Kugelgen I. INTRODUCTION Since the middle of the nineteenth century, Arab intellectuals and scholars of different training and orientation have been asking how the Arab culture that once enlightened Europe with its science and philosophy could have declined. For some, this decline and technological backwardness must be traced to the failure of Ibn Rushd's rationalist thinking, i. e., to the triumph of Muslim orthodoxy and mysticism. The battle between these opposing forces is cast in terms relevant to the modern Arab world: adherents of the West are identified with Ibn Rushd and those of the mystical way of life with fatalism and irrationalism. 1 Another even more important aspect of the Ibn Rushd revival is the conflict between the proponents of "authenticity" (asala) and those of "modernity" (mu'asara). Phrased as a question, the issue is- this: how can Muslim Arabs who wish their nations to be modernized preserve their identity and keep from being alienated? Ibn Rushd's masterful handling of both a foreign tradition and his own culture, especially in his theological and philosophical treatises Fasl al-Maqal (abbr., Fasl)2 and Tahafut al-Tahafut (abbr., T-7),3 is thus taken as a model. Though the authors considered here are more or less independent of one another, they agree upon the need to resuscitate the rationalism of Ibn Rushd while combating the theosophy and irrationalism of Ibn S1na and his Iranian school. The paradigms of science and philosophy have changed, however, and linked with these changes is the secularization of the Western world. One may wonder, therefore, how it is possible to link modernity with ideas rooted in natural determinism, theocentrism, and teleology; with a logic that is linear, categorical, and deductive; and with a science that deems thing and word to be identical. The Alif 16 (1996) 97</page><page sequence="2">contemporary Arab thinkers whom I somewhat provocatively call "Averroists"onnect their own Weltanschauung and political positions primarily, and with repeated emphasis, to Ibn Rushd. Thus they try to elaborate a new Averroistic tradition, but they handle the problem of anachronism in various ways. That is, the scope of ideas covered in their interpretations of Ibn Rushd embraces the Thomistic as well as the materialistic and atheistic Weltanschauung, religious integrism as well as secularism.4 Nonetheless, given the way the "Arab Averroists" present themselves, two major streams or factions may be discerned: "Latin Averroism" and "Islamic rationalism." "Latin Averroism" was used by Ernest Renan to denote a quite heterogeneous "movement of freethinkers" who referred to themselves as Averroists or whose intellectual roots could be traced back to Averroes.s It is a point of reference for the Syrian socialist journalist and writer Farah Antun (1874-1922), who lived in Egypt from 1897 onwards, and for a few historians of philosophy. Most notable are the Egyptian liberal thinker Muhammad 'Atif al- 'Iraq (born in 1935),6the Moroccan socialist Muhammad 'Abid al-Jabir (born in 1936), and the Syrian Marxist Tayyib T1zlnl (born in 1938).7 In aligning themselves with the "Latin Averroists," these intellectuals do not seek to raise the same questions and problems as the "freethinkers" of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It is more that they revere them as precursors of the Enlightenment and hope to develop their own history in that way. In fact, they strive to secularize thought and separate state and religion. Thus, they concentrate on Ibn Rushd' s criticism, mental attitude, and mode of thought; on the logical consequences of his plea for the autonomy of reason; and on some of his philosophical ideas. They seldom reconstruct Ibn Rushd's precise theories, for they see them as outdated and as best understood in terms of the present standard of knowledge. "Islamic rationalism," particularly in the sense of Mu'tazilite thinking, is the starting-point for several Egyptian Muslims. Of primary importance here is the historian of philosophy, Mahmud Qasim (1913-1973), former dean of the teacher-training institute Dar al-'Ulum, a branch of Cairo University. Then there is the well-known journalist and essayist Muh. ammad 'Ammara8 who was born in 1931; formerly a Marxist, he is now a "moderate Islamist." Finally, there is the professor of philosophy and current Chair of the Department of Philosophy in the Faculty of Arts at Cairo University, Hasan Hanaf1, who was born in 1935;9 once a Moslem Brother fascinated with Nasserism, he now calls himself an "Islamic leftist." 98 Alif 16 (1996)</page><page sequence="3">These thinkers understand Ibn Rushd and themselves as continuing the tradition which postulates the absolute harmony of revelation and reason, guaranteed by the allegorical interpretation of the Qur'an. Consequently, they reject the separation of state and religion. Insofar as they are "Averroists," they look to the harmonizing aspects of Ibn Rushd's theses and shy away from an explicit discussion of the development of science and philosophy; rather, they prefer to take his theological and philosophical teachings as starting-points for their own ideas. Notwithstanding this agreement in focusing on Ibn Rushd, the results of their reading of his work lead to quite distinct results, as shall be shown later. Clearly, these two groups are not homogeneous, but as "ideal types" they portray the basic premises underlying contemporary interpretations of Ibn Rushd in the Arab world. And on the rare occasions when these two groups of "Averroists" refer directly to one another or enter into a direct exchange, these premises become significant. One of these exchanges is the 1902 dispute between Farah. Antun and Muhammad 'Abduh (1849-1905), the Egyptian Muslim reformer, which centers on the relationship between religion and science. Antun's naturalistic, even materialistic, interpretation of Ibn Rushd is implicitly or explicitly a starting-point for the "Arab Averroists" oriented toward "Latin Averroism" and other "sympathizers." The Coptic socialist Salama Musa (1887-1958)1Â° and the Muslim liberal Lutfi Jum'a (1886-1953),11 for example, are only indirectly concerned with Ibn Rushd. 'Abduh, who sees himself in the tradition of "Islamic rationalism," cannot be called an "Averroist." Indeed, he stood up for him only under pressure and never proclaimed Ibn Rushd to be one of his models.12 Nonetheless, his rehabilitation of Ibn ltushd as a good Muslim and his attack on the distortions of the genuine Ibn Rushd by "Latin Averroists" has become a pattern for contemporary "Islamic rationalists" who seek to free Ibn Rushd from the stigma of heresy. On the one hand, such authors strive to present him as the initiator of Europe's progress and thus to portray Islam as the teacher of the West. On the other hand, they praise him as an "Islamic rationalist," i. e., as one who balances faith and reason and furthers enlightenment without adopting atheism or leading to its path. These two obviously contradictory assertions reveal the Islamic and apologetic side of the revival of Ibn Rushd and also the reason for the Alif 16 (1996) 99</page><page sequence="4">general interest Muslim theologians take in him. Before entering into a detailed account of some of the "Arab Averroists," I want to call attention to a phenomenon just mentioned in passing, namely, the growing academic and non-academic concern with Ibn Rushd in the Arab world evident since the end of the last century and to which the "revival of Ibn Rushd" or "Arab Averroism" is connected, without necessarily being caused by it. In 1885-1886, two works of Ibn Rushd were published for the first time in an Arab country, namely, Tahafut al-Tahafut13 and perhaps also the Short Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics.l4 By 1988, more than a hundred editions of different works of his had appeared.15 And there is an even greater number of monographs, essays, articles, chapters in histories of philosophy, and contributions to encyclopedias focused on Ibn Rushd. Their authors are often teachers of Western and Islamic philosophy at state or Islamic universities. Until the sixties such scholars were mainly Egyptian; since then, Lebanese, Syrian, and Maghrebi scholars have joined the field.16 In these countries, Ibn Rushd is also part of the subject matter as assigned to advanced level students. Yet it is important to note that the works presented to high school pupils, to al-Azhar students, and in many cases also to state university students are primarily the theological-philosophical treatises, namely, Fasl, T-T, al-Kashf 'an Manahij al-Adilla fi 'Aqa'id al-Milla (abbr. al-Kashf)17 and Damlma.l 8 Arab readers today are therefore familiar with another corpus and thus to a certain degree with another Ibn Rushd than were his European readers during the Middle Ages.19 Insofar as the majority of Arab readers who turn to Ibn Rushd today are intent on "restoring" his reputation as a good Muslim, the commentaries on Greek philosophy are of lesser interest. Because "Averroists" as well as "non-Averroists" look for ideas that can be linked to contemporary life, the most attractive aspects of his thinking are his positions taken against or in favour of the main Islamic traditions. Nonetheless, commentaries on two of Aristotle' s works the Metaphysics20 and De Anima21 are also read, though far less than the treatises mentioned above. Moreover, many of Ibn Rushd's writings have not come down to us in their original Arabic version.22 And of those that have come down, most have either been edited only recently or not yet been edited at all.23 Thus, lack of interest in the Commentator cannot be attributed merely to an absence of curiosity about him. As noted, the theological-philosophical tracts are more Alif 16 (1996) 100</page><page sequence="5">important in the contemporary historical context. This holds even for Farah. Antun, whose pleading for Averroes is incorrectly seen as a mere copy of Ernest Renan's Averroes et l Averroisme, and with whom I shall start my account of the "Arab Averroists." This will be followed by a brief look at 'Abduh's refutation of Antun. And then I will consider three other divergent approaches to, and ideological uses of, Ibn Rushd: the theologic-scholastical interpretation of Mahmud Qasim, the Nasserist view of Muh. ammad 'Ammara and the epistemological-secularist reading of Muh. ammad 'Abid al-Jabirl. In all of this, I will restrict myself to an examination of the most significant textual interpretations and leave the historical background aside. II. ANTUN AND CABDUH Many Arab and Western authors mention Antun' s articles24 and monograph on Ibn Rushd25 but do not analyse Ibn Rushd's role in them or concentrate on exposing their general purpose, viz. secularism.26 They tend thereby to mislead the reader, because they suggest that Antun presents Ibn Rushd as a secularist, which is only partially true. Antun considers Ibn Rushd as by far the most significant "Arab philosopher." He declares his works to be "absolutely the most important Arabic books" and takes their different reception in the Orient and the Occident as a kind of didactic history play: the voice of Ibn Rushd should be heard by Arabs in this time of relative openness to science, since his fate indicates clearly what led to the decline of Islamic and the ascent of European culture.27 Here Antun is pointing to the separation of state and religion, which he sees as the only guarantee for the freedom of thought.28 In this sense, he also makes use of Averroes against all those who consider the reform of religion as the remedy for the "sick Orient." In a polemical article about al-Afghanl, he presents Ibn Rushd as a secularist in the field of thought who thoroughly distinguishes science from religion and thereby protects each from the other.29 Elsewhere, in addition to blaming 'Abduh for portraying Islam as a religion of reason and thus juxtaposing it to Judaism and Christianity as irrational religions,30Antun confronts this position with Ibn Rushd's relatively greater religious tolerance and his definition of religious law (shara'i ) as the teaching of virtue.31 Sometimes, however, Antun harshly accuses Ibn Rushd of disregarding the bounds of reason and reducing religion to being the handmaiden of philosophy. He then rejects Ibn Rushd's rules for 101 Alif 16 (1996)</page><page sequence="6">allegorical interpretation (ta'wll) of the sharl'a and contrasts them with those of al-Ghazall, whom he praises as the Arab who excelled all his compatriots in the sound understanding of religion.32 Thus, although characterized as the greatest philosopher of the Arabs, Ibn Rushd is also sometimes described as a great danger for religion.33 When arguing this way, Antun adopts Renan's interpretation and classifies the tenet of the world's eternity and that of the conjunction of the material with the active intellect as an expression of materialism ('ibara 'an madhhab maddl).34 Here it was necessary for Antun to follow Renan. Otherwise, he would have had to consult the difficult Latin, Hebrew, or Arabic manuscripts, since the most important works where Ibn Rushd sets forth his physical and psychological teachings were either lost in their original Arabic version or not yet published as with the Large Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics. The same holds for Averroes' political teaching, in which Antun takes an obvious interest: the Arabic version of the commentary on Plato's Republic has not been handed down to us,35 and the commentaries on Aristotle's Rhetoric and Poetics were not yet edited or only partially edited.36 Thus, when pointing to Ibn Rushd's appeal for the emancipation of women, which Antun likens to the position of the first Egyptian who argued for women's rights, Qasim Amln (1865-1908), Antun simply translates Renan's corresponding short paraphrase of the Commentary on Plato's Republic.37 Besides pursuing secularism, religious tolerance, and women's rights, Antun also uses his revival of Ibn Rushd to strengthen the belief in science and in the ability of man to understand nature and thus utilize it for his own sake. For this purpose, as in the case of ta'wll and the equality of religions, where he is quoting from Fasl and T-T, Antun does not depend upon Renan, who paid little attention to these subjects, but on Ibn Rushd himself. With Ibn Rushd, and like all other "Arab Averroists," Antun considers the principle of causality as the basis of science. Anyone who denies or seems to deny it is qualified as an enemy of scientific knowledge. Antun cites long passages from al-Ghazall's refutation of the philosophers' views and from Ibn Rushd's arguments against it,38 upon which he comments as follows: If the word necessity (al-talazum wa-'l-.darura) is taken 102 Alif 16 (1996)</page><page sequence="7">from the laws of nature (al-nawamls al-tabl'iyya) these laws turn into chaos, and the one who believes in them becomes like the one who does not believe in them. The belief in the existence of causes or in their non-existence thus becomes identical.39 Antun regards the dispute between the mutakallimun and the falasifa over causality as fundamental and sees no possibility of harmonizing their views.40 Like all other "Arab Averroists" and perhaps even Ibn Rushd himself, Antun seems unaware of the fact that belief in the absolute omnipotence of God does not influence the "practical validity of causality.''4l But the main reason for rejecting the reconciliation of the two positions is probably his wish to free philosophy and science from the belief in miracles and at the same time to protect religion from the philosophical claim that God is bound, i. e., that He has to follow forever the laws he established, as Antun once puts it.42 'Abduh sets forth his completely different view of Ibn Rushd only in the first of the seven essays devoted to attacking the presumed anti-Islamic stand taken by Antun in his article on the medieval philosopher.43 One of the main points 'Abduh tries to refute has already been mentioned, namely the claim that the mutakallimun denied causality. Without explicitly confirming Ibn Rushd's tenets, 'Abduh focuses on refuting Antun's materialistic interpretation in order to show the compatibility of reason and faith. He then attempts to demonstrate that Ibn Rushd did not teach collective immortality. 'Abduh adduces three arguments to free Ibn Rushd from the "stigma" of materialism. First, since he was a Peripatetic, he must have been a metaphysician.44 Second, his "Neoplatonic" theory of emanation ('Abduh seems to hint at the Short Commentary on the Metaphysics45) shows that he understands God to be the ontological basis of the world. Third, his theory of conjunction demonstrates that the rational soul of man is free from matter and that the intelligibles are actualized in it only with the help of the active intellect.46 To prove the falseness of Antun's opinion that Ibn Rushd negated individual immortality, 'Abduh advances the idea of the individual immortality of the soul, a position held by Ibn S47 In this vein, probably due to his inability to procure the necessary primary sources, 'Abduh's general presentation of Ibn Rushd is marked by a failure to distinguish him from the otherfalasifa. 'Abduh's refutation is moderate and unbiased in style, and even Alif 16 (1996) 103</page><page sequence="8">if one takes into consideration his difficult and exposed position, which made it impossible for him to profess heterodox ideas frankly, his interest in Ibn Rushd is patently different from Antun's. For 'Abduh, Ibn Rushd is a historical celebrity, useful only insofar as he demonstrates the tolerance of Islam Ibn Rushd's "anathema" and unfortunate fate in the Islamic world being passed over almost in silence.48 Still his view of Ibn Rushd shows a new approach to Islamic philosophy: it is no longer regarded as damnable, and some of its teachings for instance, the theory of causality are reconciled with teachings of the kalam.49 III. MAHMUD QASIM Because it was so unusual among both modernizing Christians and Muslims in the time of 'Abduh and Antun to justify the call for rationalist thinking by resuscitating a hitherto more or less forgotten and disdained medieval Islamic "rationalist philosopher," Antun must be seen as an exception. Since the forties, however, this tendency to legitimize the recourse to reason has gained some popularity in Egyptian Muslim theological circles. Mahmud Qasim (1913-1973) is the most outspoken "Averroist" of this group. He began his studies in philosophy in Egypt under one of the pioneers in the recovery of Islamic philosophy, Mustafa 'Abd al-Raziq (died in 1947), among others, and completed them in Paris. From the beginning of his scholarly writing, Qasim took an interest in Ibn Rushd. Thus, his "These de Lettres" (Sorbonne, 1945) is a comparative study of Ibn Rushd's and Thomas Aquinas' theories of knowledge,50 while his "These de Lettres complementaire" (Sorbonne, 1945) is a translation of al-Kashfinto French.5l This latter treatise is the one Qasim considers the most important of Ibn Rushd's works, so much so that he later edited it with a preliminary critical apparatus and lengthy introduction in which he summarized the arguments of the Ash'antes, Mu'tazilites, and Matundites for the primary dogmas and compared them to those of Ibn Rushd. As might be expected, Qasim favors the arguments of Ibn Rushd in most cases. In addition, Qasim deals with Ibn Rushd in several other publications, of which the monograph al-Failusuf al-Muftara 'alaihi Ibn Rushd (The Besmirched Philosopher Ibn Rushd) might well be the best known.52 He also began to edit the first four of Ibn Rushd's Middle Commentaries on Aristotle's Organon, but died before finishing the project. It was then taken on and expanded by Charles Butterworth 104 Alif 16 (1996) </page><page sequence="9">with the assistance of Ah. mad 'Abd al-Majld Harldl.53 As already suggested, Qasim bases his interpretation mainly on al-Kashf. This does not mean that he neglects Ibn Rushd's other writings. Indeed, in contrast with the majority of the "Arab Averroists," he consults many primary sources. Besides the theological-philosophical treatises, Fasl, Damlma, and T-T, Qasim uses, according to his own statements, the Tafslr Ma Ba'da al-Tabl 'a, the Talkhls [Jawami'] Kitab al-Nafs, the Jawami' Kitab al-Hiss wa-'l-Mahsus, the De Beatitudine anima, parts of the "Epistle on the Possibility of Conjunction," and the Talkhls Kitab al-Maqulat. Nonetheless, whenever possible Qasim reads these works in the light of al-Kashf. He tries thereby to place Ibn Rushd in the tradition of the Mu'tazilites, al-Kindl, and al-Ghazall, while characterizing him as the peak of the "Arabic-Islamic genius" represented by these "Islamic rationalists." At the same time, Qasim distinguishes Ibn Rushd from al-Farabl, Ibn Sma, Ibn BaUa, and Ibn Tufail, whom he classifies as Neoplatonists and Gnostics, as philosophers alien to the "genuine spirit of Islam."s4 Even in 1972, Qasim was persuaded that the struggle between the "heirs of authentic Islamic thinking" and those of "Greek thinking" probably meaning thereby the Arab followers of contemporary Western thinking was still going on.Sf He declares that the aim of harmonizing faith and reason is the main feature common to the "Islamic rationalists," including, of course, Ibn Rushd. This harmony is reached by remaining open to rational conclusions while keeping oneself "independent" from foreign ideas or, rather, while subjecting them to Muslim dogma.S6 Yet even if Qasim attributes this characteristic to the Mu'tazilites, al-Kindl, al-Ghazall, and Ibn Rushd, he clearly prefers the solutions of the Mu'tazilites to those of the Ash'arites and sees Ibn Rushd as having been "able to correct the opinions of the Mu'tazilites and succeed in proving all the Islamic dogmas of belief in a sound [sallm] way.''S7 Thus Qasim brings the mutakallimun, al-Kindl, and Ibn Rushd together with respect to content as well as method. As distinct from Ibn Rushd' s sharp criticism of the analogy between the suprasensible and the sensible (qiyas al-gha'ib 'ala al-shahid) of the mutakallimun,S8 Qasim holds that they all refused this kind of analogy and were therefore able to avoid any anthropomorphism.S9 Anthropomorphism stands for irrationalism, and, as is often the case among the apologists of Islam, Qasim attributes it especially to Alif 16 (1996) 105</page><page sequence="10">Christianity. He uses Ibn Rushd as his instrument in order to demonstrate the superiority of the Muslim over the Christian religion as a result of its rational character.60 Thus, his portrait of Ibn Rushd's attitude toward these two religions differs greatly from Antun's. That portrait is not as wrong as one might expect from Antun's choice of quotes. Antun overlooked Ibn Rushd's statement in T-T about the Islamic Law being superior because of its better formulation of the rules of worship and hence more effective stimulation to virtuous action.61 Nor does he say anything at all about those passages in al-Kashf, where Ibn Rushd declares in much stronger terms that Islam is by far the best religion.62 For his part, Qasim neglects T-T and quotes the following passage from al-Kashf: If we were to go on to explain the superiority of one sharl'a over another, and the excellence of the sharl'a ordained for Jews and Christians, and the virtue of the doctrine established for us in respect to the apprehension of Allah and the Future Life and what lies between these two, it would require many volumes while even then we would have to confess the difficulty we had in performing the task.63 However apologetic this passage might seem, the superiority Ibn Rushd identifies in the larger context is almost the same as that mentioned in T-T. But there is one addition, namely, that Islam is the seal of the shara'i' and is not revealed exclusively to one people but to all human beings.64 Hence the qualitative difference between the "rational" Islamic and the "irrational" Jewish and Christian revelations that Qasim implicitly attributes to Ibn Rushd cannot be found in the statements of the medieval philosopher. Among the "Arab Averroists," as well as among all the Muslim theologians who take an interest in Ibn Rushd, Qasim is by far the most extreme in trying to demonstrate Ibn Rushd's orthodoxy.65 According to him, Ibn Rushd rejected the theory of the world's eternity and taught its creation; believed not in a collective, but in an individual immortality of the soul; and subordinated philosophical to religious truth. To justify his interpretations, Qasim is forced to distort some of Ibn Rushd' s major tenets, even when adducing arguments from al-Kashf. How Qasim proceeds can best be illustrated by his interpretation of Ibn Rushd's theory about the world's coming into Alif 16 (1996) 106</page><page sequence="11">being. Qasim's fundamental premise is that Ibn Rushd the commentator must be separated from Ibn Rushd the philosopher. To overcome the difficulty of this distinction, he elaborates the following rule: whenever Ibn Rushd deviates from the first teacher or develops one of his ideas, he is expressing his own opinion; otherwise, he is merely glossing him as faithfully as possible.66 Yet, by itself, this rule does not necessarily lead to the strange interpretations by which Qasim tries to rehabilitate Ibn Rushd and free him from the accusations of infidelity advanced by Muslims, "Latin Averroists," and some orientalists. In the present instance, the term coined by Ibn Rushd in the treatises addressed to the 'ulama for the "coming into being or the existence of the world as a whole" in no way implies a rejection of the theory of the world's eternity. The "terminological compromise," as I shall call it, by which Ibn Rushd aims to reduce the differences between the falasifa and the mutakallimun to a minimum consists in linking the eternal attributes of the world as a whole namely, that it "is not made from anything and not preceded by time" with the attribute of being created in time that is, that it "is brought into existence by something, I mean, by an agent."67 Thus Ibn Rushd describes the world as a whole as "perpetually coming into existence."68 Ibn Rushd regards this idea as being in accordance with the apparent meaning (gahir) of the Qur'an and charges that the mutakallimun deviate from it. To prove that the Qur'an nowhere suggests a creatio ex nihilo Ibn Rushd urges the following: "He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and His throne was on the water" [11, 7], taken in their apparent meaning imply that there was a being before this present being, namely, the throne and the water, and a time before this time, i. e., the one which is joined to the form of this being, namely the number of the movement of the celestial sphere.... And the words of the Exalted, "Then He directed Himself towards the sky, and it was smoke" [41, 11], in their apparent meaning imply that the heavens were created from something.69 Rather, as this passage clearly indicates, Ibn Rushd points to way the Qur'an characterizes the world as having come into being from Alif 16 (1996) 107</page><page sequence="12">something else and within time, that is, with the particular attributes of perceptible things. Elsewhere, he explains this by identifying the purpose of the Holy Scripture, namely, to reach all men and not only an elite.70 Consequently, Scripture is silent about "the relation which exists between the nature of the possible existent [i. e., the world as a whole] and the necessary existent [i. e., God].''71 Clearly then, in his theological-philosophical treatises, Ibn Rushd does not adhere to the theory of creatio ex nihilo that he rejects in his commentaries.72 Qasim's main argument for his interpretation is Ibn Rushd's proof of the existence of God from motion. According to Qasim, yet without any clear reference, Ibn Rushd deviates from the original Aristotelian proof and teaches that: God has created the celestial bodies and their 1notion out of nothing ['adam] and not within time, because time could not precede the existence of the things moved, as long as we consider it as a measure for their motion. Thus motion requires a first mover or a cause which draws it out from [absolute] non-existence ['adam] into existence.73 Qasim knows all too well that his view contradicts the Qur'anic verses cited by Ibn Rushd. He tries to neutralize the contradiction by quoting Ibn Rushd's statement that the apparent meaning (gahir) of the Qur'an was intended for the common people. From this, Qasim concludes that Ibn Rushd believed only the intellectual elite was able to grasp the inner meaning of the respective Qur'anic verses, i.e., to conceive of creation out of nothing, while the ordinary man' s faculty of apprehension could not reach this level.74 Qasim seeks further arguments to support his unusual view in Ibn Rushd's refutation of the theory of emanation (nagariyyat al-faiO as expressed in T-T.75 In rejecting this Neoplatonic theory, considered by Qasim himself to provide crucial support for the theory of the world's eternity, Ibn Rushd seeks to prevent the implicit affirmation of a heretical tenet.76 In sum, Qasim tries to refute most of the interpretations to which Ibn Rushd had been subject in both the West and the East. He thereby reveals himself as much more conservative than 'Abduh, who did not regard the theories of the eternity of the world and of emanation as disbelief, even though he did not adhere to them personally. In fact, 108 Alif 16 (1996) </page><page sequence="13">Qasim seems closer to Ash'arite thinking than 'Abduh. As a result, Qasim's preference for Ibn Rushd-though somewhat mutilated or weakened and for the Mu'tazilites over the Ash'arites and the Muslim literalists, and therefore his general claim in favor of rationalism within the framework of Muslim dogma, can be understood as an expression of liberal thinking. This is especially true when his position is compared with something like the credo of the Muslim Brothers. At the same time, his reading is a challenge to the West or, rather, a call to Muslims to shake off intellectual domination by reviving their own rationalist tradition. It is important to note that Qasim is almost the only theologian interested in Ibn Rushd who is not self-contradictory with regard to Ibn Rushd's influence on the West. The Azharite Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman Baisar, for example, adheres to a theological Weltanschauung while praising Ibn Rushd for having initiated the European Renaissance and Enlightenment.77 Qasim, on the other hand, declares Thomas Aquinas and his school to be the only real Averroists.78 Thus, Qasim's complete rejection of Neoplatonism and gnosticism should be viewed in the context of the widespread fatalism, superstition, and recourse to magic and saints with which they are often-rightfully or wrongfully-identified.79 IV. MUHAMMAD 'AMMARA At the end of the era of Jamal 'Abd al-Nasir, a traditionally raised independent scholar, a pupil of Mahmud Qasim, Muh. ammad 'Ammara, also made Ibn Rushd one of his favorite Islamic models and tried to revive his "Islamic rationalism."80 Yet his interpretation clearly shows the marks of Nasirist socialism. 'Ammara, who had close contacts with socialist organizations during his years of studies, wrote over fifty books and numerous articles in addition to editing some twenty-odd works by famous Muslim personalities, especially from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.81 Most of his writings are concerned with the role Islam will play in the future of the Arabs, in other words, with how the "challenges of modernity," such as Western rationalism, secularism, and materialism can be met safely and without losing one' s own identity while still profiting from the morally acceptable achievements of modernity. 'Ammara sees himself as a perpetuator of the reform begun by Jamal al-Dln al-Afghanl (1838-1897) and Muh. ammad 'Abduh.82 He criticizes the traditionalists as well as the Westernized, seeking a middle course in order to unify the umma.83 Alif 16 (1996) 109</page><page sequence="14">His main publications on Ibn Rushd appeared between 1968 and 1973. "Ibn Rushd and Rationalist Philosophy in Islam," his first article on Ibn Rushd, appeared in the leftist Nasirist journal al-Tallsa and was republished in 1971 in the collected volume Muslim Revolutionaries under the title "Arab Reason at its Height."84 'Ammara is chiefly concerned here with Ibn Rushd's theoretical definition of the relationship between religion and philosophy and some of the practical applications of his ideas of God, the world's eternity, knowledge, and freedom of act and will. In addition, he outlines some of Ibn Rushd' s political ideas, relying mostly on Renan's summary of some passages from the Commentary on Plato s Republic. However, he adds another dimension by emphatically stating that Ibn Rushd was a man of theory and praxis.85 In Materialism and Idealism in the Philosophy of Ibn Rushd,86 a monograph of one hundred and ten pages clearly addressed to intellectuals, 'Ammara tries to show that a Weltanschauung common to both Materialists and Idealists, by whom in this context he means Muslim believers, is possible on the basis of several of Ibn Rushd's tenets. With the exception of most of the political tenets, these principles are the ones dealt with in his first article, though they are presented here with much more precision and are augmented by some ideas 'Ammara understands as "pantheistic," namely, monopsychism, the world as an animated being, the identity of intellect and intelligibles, and the correlation of unity and multiplicity in the world. His final article on Ibn Rushd, "The Posture Toward the Rationalist Legacy of Ibn Rushd,"87 concentrates on the history of the reactions to Ibn Rushd after his death, both in the Islamic and the Christian world. Its less academic style shows that it is directed to a wider public. In addition to his explicit treatment of Ibn Rushd in these three publications, 'Ammara often refers to Ibn Rushd because of his progressive ideas in other writings. He outlines Ibn Rushd's theory of free will and predestination in The Mu'tazilites and the Problem of Human Freedom and his view on the connection between religion and philosophy in The Arabs and the Challenge,88 an apologia for Islam but at the time a critique of traditionalism. In addition, 'Ammara has published an edition of Fasl and Damlma based primarily on Hourani' s critical edition.89 'Ammara's primary sources are T-T, Fasl, and Damlma, but in some instances he also refers al-Kashf, the Middle Commentary on Aristotle's Rhetoric, and the Short Commentary on the Metaphysics. Alif 16 (1996) 110</page><page sequence="15">He characterizes the philosophical-theological treatises and Ibn Rushd's juridical work Bidayat al-Mujtahid as the incorporation of the genius of the umma in philosophy and religion, reason and tradition, and politics and law and 'Ammara considers them "the Arabic-Islamic Averroism."90 Yet 'Ammara does not rely on al-Kashf often, since he considers it "popular writing" as a result of its sometimes anthropomorphist argumentation.91 He does not deny the major influence Aristotle had on Ibn Rushd, for he deems the rational method (al-manhaj al-aqll), that is, "drawing out the unknown from the known" (istikhraj al-majhul min al-maslum), to be characteristic of Aristotelian as well as Qur'anic logic.92 Because he holds that some of the most decisive teachings in which Ibn Rushd takes a different point of view from that of Aristotle are to be found only in T-T, he relies primarily on it and does not concentrate on the philosophical ideas Ibn Rushd sets forth in the commentaries 93 However, even if 'Ammara does not explicitly distinguish the philosopher Ibn Rushd from the commentator Ibn Rushd nor condemn the "Latin Averroists," he still rejects a materialistic-atheistic interpretation and attributes to him a "religious-materialistic" Weltanschauung.94 'Ammara regards Ibn Rushd as above all a person who can reconcile the quarreling members of the umma and lead them to progress: If we wish our umma to have an honourable future, which rests on enlightenment [istinara], reason, the achievements of science and its applications, we have to make this desired future a natural prolongation of those aspects of our heritage which are enlightened through the light of reason and marked by its proofs. At the head of them is the legacy of Ibn Rushd and of the philosophers and thinkers who followed in his path.95 Immediately after, he continues: Let us forge out of the thought of this excellent Arabic-Islamic philosopher a weapon we can use in the stmggle for our further development and progress. 'Ammara holds Ibn Rushd's proofs for the agreement between religion and philosophy to be the most successful ones of all. In his eyes, the reason for this success lies mainly in Ibn Rushd's distinction between the different intellectual faculties, a distinction which makes Alif 16 (1996) lll</page><page sequence="16">it necessary to choose different expressions for the same truth.96 Taken by itself, this distinction is not very original; some mutakallimun adhered to it, as did many philosophers. Be that as it may, 'Ammara adopts and teaches Ibn Rushd's rule for interpretation himself,97 as do most of the "Arab Averroists" and many of the contemporary Muslims taking an interest in Ibn Rushd, and prefers it because of its clarity and precision. 'Ammara has additional reasons for his choice: he rejects the Neoplatonism and mysticism of al-Farab1 and Ibn S1na and thus also rejects, rightly or wrongly, their allegorical interpretations of the Qur'an.98 Furthermore, 'Ammara comes to the conclusion that Ibn Rushd allowed the rational interpretation to prevail over the apparent meaning of the Qur'an, everywhere but in al-Kashf.99 He adopts this position because he regards the Qur'an as a guide to virtuous action, where only the principles (usul or arkan) and far-reaching aims (maqasid, ghayat, or falsafat) are fixed, while the derivations depend on concrete and changing historical conditions.100 Thus, while seeking the support of al-Afghan1, 'Abduh, the Mu'tazilites, and Ibn Rushd, 'Ammara declares philosophy and science to be a religious duty. For this reason, he also tries to distinguish Islam from, and to show its superiority to, the other monotheistic religions. He does so, nonetheless, without referring to Ibn Rushd's statements concerning the other religions.10l To demonstrate why 'Ammara thinks the above-mentioned teachings of Ibn Rushd are adequate for reconciling materialists and Muslim believers, I would once again like to examine the theory of how the world came into existence. This will also facilitate clarifying the differences between Qasim's interpretations and those of his pupils. 'Ammara considers Ibn Rushd's "terminological compromise," which defines the world as a whole as "perpetually coming into existence" (R huduth da'im), as his most important and original contribution to the universal history of ideas. Quoting Ibn Rushd, however, he underlines the fact that the apparent meaning of the Qur'anic verses cannot be understood as the complete truth and refers in this context to some of Ibn Rushd's philosophical arguments.102 He gives special consideration to Ibn Rushd's theory that the world needs a substrate which exists potentially-that God can actualize. This would mean that God is not omnipotent and hence has no power to act arbitrarily, as the Ash'arites claim, while he would still be the Creator insofar as He is the agent bestowing existence on things by connecting them, i.e., by drawing the existent out of the state of possibility into Alif 16 (1996) 112</page><page sequence="17">that of reality, an act which He executes continuously.103 For 'Ammara, this "theory of never-ending creation" (nag.ariyyat al-khalq al-mustamirr), as he calls it, is also an expression of the possibility that the world could be different than it is.104 Hence, he does not link Ibn Rushd's theory with a deterministic view of the world. 'Ammara goes on to affirm a great resemblance between the materialist theory and that of Ibn Rushd's theory, though without giving any details.105 He also asserts an almost complete conformity with the position of the Mu'tazilites. As proof, he adduces their theory of the impossibility of absolute nothingness, which he obviously deems sufficient.106 Even though only a few details have been expounded here, it is clear that 'Ammara's Ibn ltushd stands primarily for the unity of the umma. He is presented as an integrating figure, one who is rational while keeping his faith, a philosopher with a sense of realism and pragmatism, one who brings Man "down to earth" so that he can use his forces for the sake of the community. V. MUHAMMAD 'ABID AL-JABIRI During the same period in which 'Ammara was advancing his Islamic socialist view of Ibn Rushd, the Syrian scholar Tayyib T1z1n1 was presenting a challenging Marxist one. In particular, he interpreted the theory of the world's eternity as a first expression of materialism and atheism and left the theological-philosophical treatises aside, considering them a cloak. The Berber Moroccan socialist Muh. ammad 'Abid al-Jabirl spread T1z1n1's Marxist interpretation of Ibn Rushd and other Islamic philosophers as a teacher of philosophy at a secondary school in the seventies. At the end of this decade, he replaced T1z1n1's Marxist approach to Islamic philosophy with an epistemological one and began to distinguish between the "irrational" thinking of the Mashriq and the "rational" thought of the Maghrib, taking Ibn S1na and Ibn Rushd as representatives respectively. In what follows I will focus upon al-Jabirl and the main points of his interpretation, a procedure that will permit some reflection about the reasons for his change of position. Al-Jabir1 belongs to the generation schooled through university in Morocco and thus not going to another Arab or European country. Since the beginning of the eighties, with his novel assessment of Islamic philosophy in We and the Heritage and its further development into an extensive Critique of Arab Reason, he has been Alif 16 (1996) 113</page><page sequence="18">counted among the most important and well-known intellectuals of a secularist tendency in the Arab world.l07 In Morocco itself, he gained prominence in the seventies as an active socialist and as a secondary school teacher and, more recently, university professor in the Faculty of Arts at Rabat's Universite Mohammed V.108 Al-Jabirl's main work on Ibn Rushd is the article "The Philosophical School in the Maghrib and in al-Andalus: Project for a New Reading of Ibn Rushd's Philosophy," originally published in Nahnu wa-'l-Turath.109 He also deals with him in his The Genesis of Arab Reason (abbr. Takwln), where the most important issues raised in Nahnu are summarized.1 l0 In The Structure of Arab Reason (abbr. Bunya), he focuses especially on Ibn Rushd as a theologian, an aspect merely touched upon in the other books.1 11 Though the publications on Ibn Rushd are relatively small, he plays an important role in al-Jabirl's critique. Apart from this, Ibn Rushd serves as proof that Islam, viz. Islamic culture, entertains the idea of a complete separation of religion and philosophy. The substance of Ibn Rushd's philosophy scarcely concerns him, for he regards it as outdated. The only exception is the theory of causality. Like Antun and the other "Arab Averroists," al-Jabirl takes it as a defense against the alleged theological negation of the principle of causality. 1 12 Given his limited interest in Ibn Rushd, that is, one focused on discovering the "ideological purposes" for which Greek philosophy was used in an Islamic context, al-Jabirl deems it sufficient to rely on Fasl, al-Kashf, and T-T.1l3 One wonders why he does not take the commentaries on Plato' s Republic and Aristotle' s Rhetoric and Poetics into account since they would have suited his purposes. It would seem that apart from the difficulty of language and the fact that these are relatively unknown commentaries, he wants to avoid any suspicion about the "originality" of Ibn Rushd's arguments, which might lead an opponent of Western thought to contest them. Unlike 'Ammara, who is recognized as an Islamist and can thus more readily refer to the Aristotelian Ibn Rushd, al-Jabirl apparently has to be more careful if he wants to have his criticism accepted among the challengers of Western culture. Al-Jabirl focuses mainly on Ibn Rushd the critic. He adopts the latter' s attack on the analogy between the suprasensible and the sensible (qiyas al-gha'ib sala al-shahi) of the mutakallimun and of fon Sma-underlining the need to separate the physical from the metaphysical,l14 as well as Ibn Rushd's criticism of the theory of Alif 16 (1996) 114</page><page sequence="19">emanation, which he understands as a refutation of "the Arabic-Islamic logic of the Mashriq.''1l5 He also points emphatically to Ibn Rushd's criticism of the third modus of being, which Ibn Slna introduces in order to describe the nature of the world as a whole-namely, as "the existent possible by itself and necessary through another" (mumkin al-wujud min dhatihi wajib min ghairihi). He understands this third modus or "third value" (qlma thalitha), as he calls it, as an offense against the premise of the excluded middle.1l6 According to al-Jabirl, these features form one part of the "theoretical, philosophical-religious stmcture of thought" in the Mashriq, with the attempt to unite religion and philosophy forming the other part.1l7 For him, Ibn Rushd is occupied not only with a critique of the first, but also of the second part. Thus he understands Ibn Rushd as intending to develop a separation of religion and philosophy by devoting himself to three questions of methodology. The first two, playing upon the French word for reading "lecture" ask how the Qur'an and the philosophy of Aristotle, "the source of all philosophy," should be read; and the third asks how the relation between religion and philosophy should be defined so that their independence is guaranteed. 1 18 His summary distillation of what he presents as Ibn Rushd's answers is that Ibn Rushd always tried to understand both the Qur'an and philosophy immanently. Al-Jabirl calls this basic approach "the axiomatic tendency in Ibn Rushd's thinking.''1l9 Ibn Rushd, al-Jabiri emphasizes, was fully aware of the fact that religion and philosophy each has its own principles and foundations and that it is not valid to advance philosophical issues against religious ones. He regarded them as two axiomatic and deductive (istintajl) constructions whose correctness (sidq) could be proven only within and not outside the respective constructions. By "correctness" al-Jabirl means faultlessness in the presentation of proofs (istidlal), not in the principles (mabadi ) and premises, for these are posited (mawdu'a) in both religion and philosophy and therefore have to be accepted without proof (burhan). Thus, according to al-Jabirl's reading of Ibn Rushd, the philosopher has to accept the principles of religion if he wants to discuss its questions, just as the theologian has to acknowledge philosophical principles if he wants to deal with philosophy.l20 He adduces several citations to prove these theses. The major ones are taken from the seventeenth and twentieth discussions in T-T where Ibn Rushd states that philosophers have no right to discuss Alif 16 (1996) 115</page><page sequence="20">religious principles and points out that every science has its own principles which must be accepted. From these statements, it could be inferred that Ibn Rushd treats religion like a science. But al-Jabirl omits the context of the remarks, namely, Ibn Rushd's declaration that miracles and all foundations of religion are principles everyone must acknowledge since they are the root of practical virtue and that anyone who denies them is a heretic who must be sentenced to death.12l In his exposition, al-Jabirl gives the impression that the acceptance of religious principles is placed on the same level as the acknowledgment of philosophical ones. Additional evidence for this thesis advanced by al-Jabirl is Ibn Rushd's having delivered Aristotle from the misunderstandings of previous commentators, on the one hand, and his precise rules for the allegorical interpretation of the Qur'an on the other that is, his insistence that ta'wll is an instrument for giving meaning to one apparent meaning (gahir) in the light of another.l22 He clearly does not adopt Ibn Rushd's rule of interpreting those verses which do not confirm rational proofs in a philosophical sense123 as a reason to doubt the "independence" of religion. Thus he does not regard Ibn Rushd's Qur'anic proofs of God's existence and of man's "conditioned freedom of will and act" on the basis of the theory of causality124 as a mixture of religion and philosophy. Rather, he accepts them as rational religious proofs and assigns them the task of overthrowing "the power of the idea that [everything] is possible" (sultat al-tajwl:).l25 Nor does al-Jabirl call Ibn Rushd's assertion of the unity of truth into question. But he does interpret this unity in quite an unusual manner one in which religion and philosophy are united by their common aim of teaching and spreading virtue. 126 The Moroccan philosopher does not consider Ibn Rushd to be the first to have adopted a critical rationalism and an "axiomatic view." Indeed, he seeks to establish a new, Maghrebi tradition of this kind of rationalism with Ibn Tumart as its initiator.127 Nonetheless, he regards Ibn Rushd as the one who brought this kind of thinking to its apex within the fields of philosophy and theology.l28 His critique and alleged separation of religion and philosophy constitute for al-Jabirl more than a simple shift in methods and concepts. Indeed, he calls it a "rupture" or "epistemological break" (qa.tl'a ibislmulujiyya) with "the spirit of Avicenna.''129 In this formulation, Ibn Slna stands for "irrationalism" because of his influence on al-Ghazall and the illuminationist schools of Persia. Al-Jabirl does not completely deny 116 Alif 16 (1996)</page><page sequence="21">the Aristotelianism of Ibn Slna, but he does explicitly judge the philosopher by the school he produced and not by its authentic thinking,130 something that must also be kept in mind when dealing with his interpretation of Ibn Rushd. 131 Thus al-Jabirl characterizes this "rupture" as a separation of two "moments" (lahgatan) in the consciousness of Arab-Islamic society, with the second having "abolished" the first, as the historical development of the Arabic and European world shows. According to al-Jabirl, the Arabs live their life outside of history, while the Europeans, having followed the path of Ibn Rushd, shape it.132 Al-Jabirl calls upon the Arabs to bring about a "complete epistemological break with the structure of the Arabic reason of the period of descent and with its offshoots in modern and contemporary thinking,"and above all, with wrongly used qiyas and with mysticism.133 In opposition to Westernized Arab intellectuals who try to modernize Arab thinking by directly applying Western ideas, he declares it necessary in view of the failure of their attempt to appropriate (imtilak) the Arabs' own history in order to overcome (tajawu:) its obstacles and lay the foundations for a "new creative age" ('asr tadwln jadld).134 It follows, then, that the "resumption of old fights" with modern principles, that is, the carrying on of Ibn Rushd's criticism in combination with the concepts of Bachelard and Foucault, would establish this foundation. The "appropriation" of some of Ibn Rushd's ideas is thus only a means to an end. Yet al-Jabirl's shift from Tlzlnl's Marxist interpretation of Islamic philosophy to a somewhat more moderate position, leaving room for the religious legitimation of scientific thinking as in the case of causality, looks very much like a concession to the Islamists. VI. CONCLUSION The motives of the various authors who seek to revive Ibn Rushd, albeit in a somewhat mutilated manner, have only been touched on here. They differ, of course, from author to author. Yet it seems to me that the decisive inducement to actualize and instrumentalize Ibn Rushd is the desire to prove that Islamic culture is equal in value to Western culture. As long as this proof has not been furnished, Arabs can neither feel themselves to be equal in rank, nor will they be accepted by the West as equal partners. However, whereas many Islamists try to prove the equal rank or frequently the superiority of Islamic culture by arguing that it is completely Alif 16 (1996) 117</page><page sequence="22">different, the "Averroists" who continue the tradition of "Islamic rationalism" seek to furnish this proof by means of a partial similarity between the two. And those who take the "Latin Averroists" as models seek to do so by means of an essential similarity. It is therefore important for them to find that attribute of progress which the West claims for itself, viz. autonomous, discursive reason, in their own culture. However, in view of the historical changes-except perhaps with respect to some theological questions the direct continuation of Ibn Rushd's thinking is more or less impossible. The authors presented here seem, therefore, to be engaged in a more or less Sisyphean task. In the end, nonetheless, one must ask what alternatives contemporary thinkers who do not want to be characterized as mere imitators of the West really have. NOTES 1 A more thorough account of this subject may be found in my book, Averroes und die arabische Moderne - Ansatze zu einer Neubegrundung des Rationalismus im Islam (Leiden: E. J. Brill [Islamic Philosophy, Theology and Science 19], 1994). 2 George F. Hourani, ed., Ibn Rushd (Averroes), Kitab Fasl al-Maqal with its Appendix (Damlma) and an extract from Kitab al-Kashf 'an Manahij al-Adilla, Arabic Text (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1959). I cite the page numbers in the margins, which correspond to those in the original Arabic edition of Marcus Joseph Muller, ed., Philosophie und Theologie von Averroes (Munich: G. Franz, 1859), which also contains the treatises al-Kashf and Damima (see below, notes 17 and 18). 3 Maurice Bouyges, ed., Averroes: Tahafot at-tahafot, Texte arabe (Beirut: Imprimerie Catholique, 1930). 4 One may ask whether, given such different options, it makes sense to speak of "Arab Averroists" insofar as the label suggests some kind of homogeneous group. Compared to the so-called Latin Averroists (see the next note), the Arab Averroists seem no more heterogeneous and have even more right to be designated as such. After all, it is not Aristotle but Ibn Rushd on whom they model themselves. 5 Averroes et l averroisme, Essai historique, in Oeuvres completes d'Ernest Renan, vol. 3 (Paris: Calmann-Levy, 1949).

The best edition is that of 'Uthman Am1n, Ibn Rushd, Talkhls fJawami'] Ma Ba'd al-Tabl'a (Cairo: Mustafa al-Babl al-Halab1 wa-Awladuhu, 1958). For additional editions, see Rosemann, "Averroes," esp. nos. 83-86; and Gomez Nogales, "Bibliografia," 367. The Large Commentary is less widespread; see Averroes, Tafslr Ma Ba'd al-Tabl'a, ed. Maurice Bouyges (Beirut: Imprimerie Catholique, 1938- 1952). 21 Only the Summary or Mukhtasar, as Jamal al-D1n al-'Alaw1 calls it (al-Matn al-Rushdl, Madkhal li-Qira a Jadlda [Casablanca: Dar Tubqal, 1986] 52-55), is known and entirely edited (in 1947, 1950 and 1985; see Rosemann, "Averroes," nos. 76, 77, 22). An extract from the Middle Commentary was published only in 1985; see Helmut Gatje, Das Kapitel uber das Begehren aus dem mittleren Kommentar des Averroes zur Schrift uber die Seele (Amsterdam, Oxford, New York: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1985). And only a few passages of the original Arabic version of the Large Commentary have come down to us; see al-'Alaw1, al-Matn al-Rushdl 108 ff.). Unfortunately, these have not yet been published. 22 According to al-'Alaw1, who re-examined this old question, Ibn Rushd's corpus consisted of 108 writings. Of these, a good third are lost in the Arabic original; see al-'Alaw1, al-Matn al-Rushdl, 14-45; see also Miguel Cruz Hernandez, Abu-l-Walld Ibn Rushd (Averroes): Vida, obra, pensamiento, influencia (Cordova: Publicaciones del Monte de Piedad y Caja de Ahorras de Cordoba, 1986) 44-51. 23 For the edited writings see Rosemann, "Averroes"; and Butterworth "The Study of Arabic Philosophy Today" and "Appendix." 24 They appeared in Alexandria in al-Jami'a, Majalla 'Ilmiyya Tahdhlbiyya Ta'rlkhiyya Sihhiyya 3 (1902): 517-540, 568-571, and 626-639. 25 Farah Antun, Ibn Rushd wa- Falsafatuhu: Wa-fi dhail al-Kitab Rudud al-Ustadh 'ala al-Jami'a fi Sitt Maqalat bi-Sha'n Maqala Mukhtasara Nasharatha al-Jami'a mundhu Ashhur fi Hadha al-Maudu' wa-Ajwibat al-Jami'a fF Sitt Maqalat ai.dan (Alexandria: Dar al-Tal1'a li-al-Tiba'a, 1903).

It should be noted, however, that Antun refers to no specific statement by Ibn Rushd. 30 Ibn Rushd, 137-140, and 185. 'Abduh develops this view on several occasions; see, e.g., Muh. ammad 'Abduh, Risalat al-Tawhld, ed.

Elsewhere, while criticizing 'Abduh for his Islamic apologetics, Antun compliments Ibn Rushd for remaining non-committal about such religious questions as the after-life and the attributes of God and equates him with al-Ghazall; see Ibn Rushd, 167 ff. and note that Antun cites passages from T-T, where Ibn Rushd forbids the investigation of miracles and the principles of religion (see, e. g., T-T, 503:8-10, 514:8-14, 16 ff., 527: 1-5, 9-15, and 528:2-5). 33 Ibn Rushd, 121-124; al-Jami'a, 626 and 638. 34Al-Jami'a, 525-527 and 629; Ibn Rushd, 67-69 (following Alfred Gary, "Averroes" in La Grande Encyclopedie, Inventaire raisonne des sciences, des lettres, et des arts [Paris: H Lamirault, n. d.], 880; and Renan, Averroes, 107 ff. and 115-127). Contrary to the common view, Antun did not rely directly on Renan in his first article on Averroes, but on this notice by Alfred Gary, a "licencie en droit" and "professeur d'economie politique," who summarizes Renan and Salomon Munk (Me'langes de Philosophie juive et 122 Alif 16 (1996)</page><page sequence="27">arabe [Paris: A. Franck, 1859]). Only in Antun's supplement to his first article ("'Aud ila Ibn Rushd," in al-Jami'a 3 [1902]: 568-571) and in the following monograph does Renan become his pr1mary source. 35 It exists only in Latin and Hebrew and has been translated into English twice only relatively recently (1956 by E. I. J. Rosenthal and 1974 by Ralph Lerner [see Rosemann, "Averroes," nos. 100 and 101 ]) and once into Spanish (Miguel Cruz Hernandez, Averroes, Exposicion de la &lt;&lt;Republica&gt;&gt; de Platon: Estudio preliminar, traduccion y notas [Madrid: Editorial Tecnos, 1986]). In Arabic, only translations of Renan' s summaries of some passages (Renan, Averroes, 133 ff.) and of a special summary by Rosenthal ("Ara' Ibn Rushd al-Siyasiyya: Katabaha li-al-Bayyina al-Duktur A. J. Rujantal," al-Bayyina 1 [1972]: 94- 103) are known. 36 For the editions, see Rosemann, "Averroes," nos. 19, 32-34,49-55, and 57-60; Butterworth, "The Study of Arabic Philosophy Today" and "Appendix," 82 ff. and 131. 37 Ibn Rushd, 77 ff. (following Renan, Averroes, 133 ff.). Antun comments on neither Ibn Rushd' s nor Qasim' s position. 38Ibn Rushd, 107-113. Antun does not follow the course of the "debate" as Ibn Rushd presents it, but sets forth each position separately. Thus, at pp. 109 ff. he cites long passages from the last discussion of al-Ghazall's Tahafut al-Falasifa, which Ibn Rushd neglected; see al-Ghazall, Tahafut al-Falasifa, ed. Maurice Bouyges (Beirut: Imprimerie Catholique, 1927) 369:7- 11, 371 :6-9, and 372: 1-375: 11. 39 Ibn Rushd, 107. 40 Al-Jami 'a, 523 ff. and 629-633. 41 Josef van Ess, Die Erkenntnislehre des 'Adudaddln al-lcl : . . Ubersetzung und Kommentar des ersten Buches seiner Mawaqif (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag GmbH, 1966) 212 and 216 ff. Concerning al-Ghazall's "concessions" to the philosophers, Simon van den Bergh states: "The theologians and Ghazali admit a scala naturae, a necessary order and succession . . . in all things"; see Averroes Tahafut Al-Tahafut: (The Incoherence of the Incoherence), trans. with intro. and notes (E. J. W. Gibb Memorial Series; London: Luzac &amp; Co., 1954) vol. 2, p.183, n. 6 (to vol. 1, p. 327). Cf. Lenn Evan Goodman, "Did al-Ghazall deny causality?

The rest of the articles appeared also in al-Manar 5 (1902): 401 -434, 441 -465, 481 -501, 521 -538, 538-545, and 561-577. In the same year, Rash1d Rida published these latter articles, together with 'Abduh's criticism of the way Gabriel Hanotaux viewed Islam, under the title al-Islam wa-'l-Nasraniyya ma'a al-'Ilm wa-'l-Madaniyya. In the introduction, Rida explained that he had not included the first article dealing with Ibn Rushd because its highly theoretical level made it of use only to the elite. 44 See al-Manar, 367-370 and 371 ff. 'Abduh divides the Greek philosophers into two groups: metaphysicians and materialists. 45 In contrast with his later writings, Ibn Rushd embraces in this early work more or less the theory of Ibn Slna; see Talkhls fJawami'] Ma Ba'd al-Tabl'a, esp. pp. 148-156, paras. 53-65. Cf. Barry S. Kogan, "Averroes and the Theory of Emanation," in Mediaeval Studies 43 (1981): 384-404, esp. pp. 387-392. 46 See al-Manar, 373 and 374-376. 'Abduh' s exposition of the human path to knowledge reveals that he was not, or better, could only with difficulty have been, acquainted with the commentaries on De anima and with other works in which Ibn Rushd discusses this issue (Heinrich C. Kuhn, Die Erkenntnistheorie des Averroes im Kontext seines philosophischen Systems (Munich, 1988 [self-printing]). 'Abduh considers Ibn Rushd's teaching to be in conformity with the theories of al-Farab1 and Ibn S1na. 47 AI-Manar, 378. 48 Al-Manar, 495. Cf. his totally different description of the persecution of the "Latin Averroists," which he equates with the cruelties of the Inquisition (Al-Manar, 423 ff.). 49 Al-Manar, 367 ff. 50 Parts I and II were published in Arabic under the title Nag.ariyyat al-Ma'rifa 'inda Ibn Rushd wa- Ta'wlluha lada Tumas al-Akwlnl (Second edition; Cairo: Maktabat al-Anglu al-Misriyya, 1969).

See, for example, Roger Arnaldez, "La pensee religieuse d'Averroes: I.

The information about 'Ammara's biography is based on an interview I had with him on 27 January, 1989. 81 A good, though not exhaustive, bibliography (the articles for instance, are not included) can be found in al-'Arab wa-'l-Tahadd (Secondedition;Damascus:DarQutaiba,1987)303- 310. 82 'Ammara has published "complete editions" of the works of both of them: al-A'mal al-Kamila li-Jamal al-DIn al-Afghanl Ma'a Dirasa 'an al-Afghan l- al-Haqlqa al-Kulliyya (Cairo: Dar al-KitSb al- 'Arabl, 1967); al-A 'mal al-Kamila li-al-lmam Muhammad 'Abduh, (3 vols.; Second edition; Beirut: al-Mu'assasa al-'Arabiyya li-'l-Dirasat wa-'l-Nashr, 1979-80). 83 See 'Ammara, al-lslam wa-'l-Mustaqbal (Cairo: Dar al-Shuruq, 1984) esp. 87-96 and 244-247; al-Islam wa-Qa.daya al-'Asr, (Second edition; Beirut: Dar al-Wah. da, 1984) 5 ff. 84 'Ammara, "Ibn Rushd wa-'l-Falsafa al-'Aqliyya fi al-Islam," al-Tall'a, Nov. 1968, 135-153 (it appeared as an appraisal on the occasion of the 770th anniversary of Ibn Rushd's death); "al-'Aql al-'Arabl fX al-Qimma," in Muslimun Thuwwar (Second edition; Beirut: al-Mu'assasa al-'Arabiyya li-al-Dirasat wa-'l-Nashr, 1974) 69- 110.

Ibn Rushd deems this theory of the Mu'tazilites to be in conformity with his own-that is, with that of the philosophers- to a certain degree; see T-T, 105- 107. 107 See al-Jabirl, Nahnu wa-'l-Turath: Qira'a Mu'asira fF Turathina al-Falsaft (Fifth edition; Casablanca: al-Markaz al-ThaqafX al-'Arabl, 1986).

Also to be reckoned among these works containing a "Critique of Arab Reason" is al-Khitab al-'Arabl al-Mu'asir: Dirasa Tahllliyya Naqdiyya (Second edition; Beirut: Dar al-Tall'a, 1985), since it is presented as an introduction to it. 108 He belongs to those members of the "Union Nationale des Forces Populaires" who were imprisoned in July 1963 and soon released on the basis of an amnesty. From 1975 to 1982, he was a member of the politburo of the "Union Socialiste des Forces Populaires," of which he was one of the founders. Afterwards, he withdrew from this activity and devoted himself mainly to the study and criticism of the history of Arab ideas.

J. de Boer's History of Philosophy in Islam and Qasim's Nagariyyat al-Ma'rifa are the only works he mentions by name.

Nahnu, 130 Alif 16 (1996)</page><page sequence="35">84 ff. and 218 ff. 117 See al-Jabirl, Nahnu, 43, 48, 84 ff., and 218 ff. 118 Naknu, 237. 119 Nahnu, 239 ff. 120 Nahnu, 238 ff. 121 See Averroes, T-T, 527:3-13 and 584:1-8. 122 See al-Jabirl, Nahnu, 245. Al-Jabirl tries to corroborate the "text-immanent understanding" by means of Ibn Rushd' s explanation "that whenever a statement in Scripture conflicts in its apparent meaning with a conclusion of demonstration, if Scripture is considered carefully, and the rest of its contents searched page by page, there will invariably be found among the expressions of Scripture something which in its apparent meaning bears witness to that allegorical interpretation or comes close to bearing witness" (Fasl, 8:4-6, following Hourani's translation, Harmony, 51). 123 Averroes, Fasl, 7: 10-15. 124 See Averroes, al-Kashf, ed. Muller, 43 and 104-113; ed. Qasim, 150 and 223-233. 125 See al-Jabiri, Bunya, 533, 561, and 570; and Nahnu, 224 and 238. 126 See al-Jabiri, Nahnu, 246. He does not explain how he reaches this conclusion, but contents himself with quotes from Ibn Rushd among others that "truth does not oppose truth but accords with it and bears witness to it" (Fasl, 7:6-9) and that "philosophy is the friend and milk-sister of religion" (Fasl, 26:3). (I quote from Harmony, 51 and 70). 127 See al-Jabirl, 40, 211, and 251-260; and Takwln, 311-316; cf. the following note. 128 He considers Ibn H. azm as a foretunner of the "cultural revolution" with respect to its criticism of qiyas, with al-Shat.lbl in the fields of usul al-dln and usul al-fiqh and Ibn Khaldun in historiography being regarded as its continuators; see Bunya, 513-553 and Takwln, 299-310. 129 See al-Jabirl, Nahnu, 50-52. 130 See Nahnu, 39 ff. and passim. The article on Ibn Slna is the most extensive of al-Jabirl's studies on an Islamic philosopher; see "Ibn Slna wa-Falsafatuhu al-Mashriqiyya: Hafriyyat fi Judhur al-Falsafa al-'Arabiyya al-Islamiyya fi al-Mashriq," in Nahnu, 87-166. 131 For example, al-Jabirl takes it for granted that Ibn Rushd' s treatises dealing with the relationship between religion and philosophy Alif 16 (1996) 131</page><page sequence="36">were known to Medieval and Rennaissance Europe and traces the conflicts that occurred between freethinkers and the Church directly back to the influence of these writings; see Takwln, 349 and cf. Nahnu, 236. 132 See al-Jabin, Nahnu, 43 and 49. Cf. Bunya, 551-553 and Takwln, 349. 133 See al-Jabin, Nahnu, 20. He defines the "epistemological break" as an irrevocable renunciation of the apparatus of cognition (methods and terms), the network of problems, and the field of cognition (haql ma 'rif ), but not of the object of cognition (mawdu ' al-ma'rifa); see Nahnu, 20 and also Gaston Bachelard, La Formation de l'esprit scientifique: Contribution a une psychoanalyse de la connaissance objective (Paris: Vrin, 1938) and Michel Foucault, Les mots et les choses Une arche'ologie des sciences humaines (Paris: Gallimard, 1966). 134 See al-Jabin, Khitab, 187-191 and Bunya, 555-573. 132 Alif 16(1996)</page></plain_text>
