<plain_text><page sequence="1">LINGUISTIC RESTRICTIONISM AND THE IDEA OF 'POTENTIAL MEANING' It is, by now, a common-place, to point out that contemporary philosophy under the influence of Moore and Wittgenstein is con cerned with language rather than with the 'world*. There is, no doubt, a great deal of room to niggle at this rather broad character ization of recent philosophy (language is, after all, 'part* of the world), but anyone familiar with recent philosophical history in Britain and America will agree that such a generalization is as true as such generalizations can be. Thus, J. J. C. Smart points out that ... in recent years, it has been argued in some quarters that in philosophy we are not concerned, as scientists are, with the dis tinction between truth and falsity, but that between sense and non sense. As philosophers, according to this conception, it is not our business to say what the world is in fact like: we must leave this to scientists and historians. What we can do, and what we are by our training peculiarly fitted to do, is to help ensure that at least when we, together with scientists and historians, utter falsehoods: that we and they do not fall into nonsense which has not even achieved the distinction of an intelligible falsehood.1 As a consequence of this 'shift* to language, philosophers have, as Smart says, attempted to place restrictions of sense upon what we can say. Some of the expressions that were ruled out of the realm of those that make sense were those that were to be found in notorious volumes of metaphysics, which indeed were difficult to make sense of, at least on their own. A few examples such as 'The Absolute is perfect* and the celebrated, 'The Nothing noths', will be enough to remind readers of the sort of thing I am now referring to. Of such expressions it was indeed plausible that the onus of significance should rest upon them, even if the attempt to show lj. J. C. Smart, Philosophy and Scientific Realism (New York: Humanities Press, 1963), pp. 3-4. Smart himself disapproves of this view.</page><page sequence="2">LINGUISTIC RESTRICTIONISM 247 their non-significance by means of the verifiability principle of meaning had substantially failed. However, along with such expres sions whose meaningfulness was problematical, other expressions which seemed, at least on the surface, unproblematically meaning ful, have been, by various philosophers, held to be deficient in some way, in sense. Thus: "I know (or believe) I am in pain" (Wittgen stein, PI, p. 246) ; "I know what I am thinking" (Wittgenstein, PI, p. 222) ; "The King of France is bald" (Strawson, "On Referring," Mind, 1950) ; "I like cultivating weeds" (P. H. Nowell-Smith, Ethics, pp. 72-73) ; "I sat down voluntarily" (Austin, "A Plea for excuses," Aristotelian Society Proceedings, 1956-57) : it would be easy to extend the list. What seems to me to distinguish expressions such as the above from expressions such as 'The Nothing noths* is that, as I have already suggested, the onus of significance is not upon them, but rather on any philosopher who holds that they are not significant. However, it will certainly have occurred to anyone familiar with recent literature in philosophy that I have not been quite fair in what I have said concerning the latter group of expressions, those which I have held are, at least prima facie significant. For, after all, the list I have presented is a very mixed list indeed, and it is highly misleading to say that philosophers who have commented on such expressions have said simply that they were nonsense. Such a stric ture would be quite just, for two separate reasons: (1) Some of the expressions above would be allowed, by philosophers who have commented upon them, to have some interpretation or some para phrase that was significant. (2) Some (other) of the expressions in the above list would be said to be nonsignificant only given some nonlinguistic context (s), but allowed significance in some other non linguistic context (s). Another way of putting the difference is this: Some of the expressions in the list would be said to be "meaning problematic" because as they stand they lack any truth-value in any context, but they suggest some natural interpretation which might have a truth-value, or some interpretation which, not being state mental (exclamatory, imperitival, etc.), cannot have a truth-value. On the other hand, some of the expressions on the list would have a truth-value without requiring any interpretation, given a certain nonlinguistic context (s), but have no truth-value outside of these nonlinguistic contexts. In the former group of expressions should be</page><page sequence="3">248 THE MONIST placed: know (or believe) I am in pain', know what I am thinking', like cultivating weeds'; in the latter group, 'The King of France is bald', and sat down voluntarily', and also, to add a new one, know I have a hand' (Norman Malcolm, "Moore's Use of Know," Mind, 1953). Even, nonetheless, allowing these differences, a number of recent philosophers, in one manner or another have attacked linguistic restrictionism in various ways and to various degrees.2 One of the most interesting, and surely one of the most thoroughgoing is that launched by Herman Tennessen in a number of articles. 3 As I read Tennessen, what he argues is that what contemporary linguistic 'restrictionists' contend are expressions that are, for one reason or another, senseless in that they violate some syntactic or semantic or pragmatic rule of speaking are nothing of the sort for there are really no such rules. The belief that there are such rules is an illusion fostered by a misunderstanding of controls that do operate on what we do say rather than what we can say. There are many reasons why we do not say certain things, but we can say any of these things, can say them and make sense. In certain areas of language, there could hardly be any argument with Tennessen's contention. We do not say insulting things to other people (very often), but we can say them. We do not utter obscenities, but we can (and sometimes do). We do not, if we occupy a particular educational or social bracket, use two negatives or say 'ain't', but we can. We do not, if we are well brought up, say what we know to be false, but we can. But these controls are, broadly speaking, social controls. They are not the sorts of controls meant by philoso phers who hold that certain expressions are meaningless, or that 2 E. G. Benson Mates, "On the Verification of Statements about Ordinary Language," Inquiry, 1 (1958) ; Karl Popper, Conjectures and Refutations (New York: Basic Books, 1962) ; W. V. O. Quine, Word and Object (Cambridge: M.I.T. Press, 1961), p. 229; Paul Ziff, Semantic Analysis (New York: Cornell University Press, 1960). 3 Among these are the following works by Herman Tennessen: "On Worth while Hypotheses," Inquiry, 2, No. 3 (1959) ; "Logical Oddities and Locutional Scarcities," Synthese, 2, No. 4 (1959) ; "What Should We Say?"

Reidel Publishing Company, 1962).</page><page sequence="4">LINGUISTIC RESTRICTIONISM 249 certain expression-utterances (in a particular context), are mean ingless. However, and this is Tennessen's major contention, there are other controls of very much the same kind that operate on what we do say, and not what we can say, and which restrictionists mistakenly believe are restrictions on what we can say. We do not, for obvious reasons, say what is egregiously false, e.g., 'There is a swan in my closet', but we can say such things meaningfully. We do not say what is obviously true, again for obvious reasons, e.g., exist*. But that is not a reason for holding that we cannot say such things, again, meaningfully. Thus far Tennessen's thesis is quite clear-cut, if not indisputable. But there is another part of his thesis which is quite a bit different from the above contentions. For, although the above contentions, if true, would explain why many expressions that were not meaningless were thought to be so, for the most part these would be those expressions which I distinguished by saying that the onus would rest on those who claimed they were not significant, rather than those who claimed they were. But there is, after all, another class of expressions which I distinguished by saying that the onus would rest upon those who claimed they were significant, and it is expressions of this sort whose prima facie non significance is not even plausibly explained by holding that they are mistakenly thought to be meaningless only because they are too true to be said or too false to be said. After all, an expression such as 'The Absolute is perfect* or 'My tie has a cause* (Tennessen) or prom ised my chair to quit smoking* is unlike know I have a pain* or am dead* in that there is some (perhaps a lot of) plausibility in holding that the two latter expressions are obviously true and obvi ously false, respectively, 'The Absolute is perfect*, 'My tie has a cause*, and promised my chair to quit smoking* do not mesh with the idea of truth or falsity at all, or, at least, do not seem to. The line that Tennessen takes here is that many expressions of this sort (and indeed, even the expressions that are 'obviously* true or false), are interpretable or paraphrasable in such a way that they can be meaningfully said, and these interpretations are, natural or plau sible. Tennessen here inveighs against what he calls "logical ped antry" and "hermeneutical clairvoyance,"4 characteristics he im 4 Herman Tennessen, "Whereof One Has Been Silent, Thereof One May Have lo Speak," Journal of Philosophy, May 11,1961, p. 267.</page><page sequence="5">250 THE MONIST puted to restrictionists, and which, Tennessen says, lead them to hold that expressions which can easily be understood are meaning less or senseless. So far (nearly), so good. I think I understand what Tennessen is claiming, although I have qualms about the truth of his claims. But, at this point, Tennessen seems to want to make two different claims which he does not seem to distinguish one from the other, and which are, indeed, hard to keep separate. The two claims are these: 1. A particular expression, as it stands, and as "pedantically" (literally?) understood seems, indeed, to make no sense. However, a completely natural, plausible, interpretation, which would be ordi narily made by those uncorrupted by restrictionism, of that expres sion, would make perfect sense. 2. A particular expression, as it stands, makes perfectly good sense, but it appears not to do so because it really describes a possible situation which is difficult to imagine or conceive of. Therefore, as of now, the expression as it stands expresses a false proposition, and describes a possible but nonexistent state of affairs, and the illusion of senselessness only arises because this possible but nonexistent state of affairs is so very outr?, or bizarre. An example taken from Tennessen5 here is the famous Moorean expression, "It is raining and I do not believe it." Now, on the first claim, above, it would, I think, be plausible to hold that a natural interpretation of 'It is raining, and I do not believe it* would be something like, simply can't believe it is raining (it was sunny just a few moments ago) '. But, on the second claim, which is the one actually used by Tennessen in this case, what he holds is that this expression actually does describe what is at least a possible psychological state of mind. One might (Tennessen does not claim that one does) have such a state of mind that might be "ade quate (ly) trans (mitted) " by the Moorean expression. One such state of mind that Tennessen describes is "P admired the landscape with closed eyes" and we might imagine equipped with "transparent eyelids or turn him into an eidetic. . . ." Two problems now arise. The first one is how to decide whether an expression makes sense as it stands or whether is requires an interpretation (however plau sible or natural it may be). A subsidiary problem here is how to Ibid.</page><page sequence="6">LINGUISTIC RESTRICTIONISM 251 decide upon some particular interpretation when none suggests itself, or when more than one does suggest itself, which to choose. The second problem is even more perplexing, namely, if it is decided that the expression in question is a case of 2 above, i.e., it makes sense as it stands and requires no interpretation, then how it is to be decided what meaning it does have, or what state of affairs it does describe? In part, the puzzle here is that whereas in the case of an expression such as 'P admired the landscape with closed eyes' Tennessen is able to light upon some state of affairs which such an expression might plausibly describe (transparency of eyelids or eidetic imagery), it is not obvious to me that he could do this in all cases, or what it would show if he could. For the question which suggests itself is, what makes that state of affairs the state of affairs to be described by that expression? For example, when Ten nessen treats the Moorean sentence, Tennessen is hard put to de scribe a state of affairs which is supposed to be described by 'It is raining and I do not believe it*. He does talk about some situation which he describes as a case of "the discrepancies between my beliefs and the actual state of things," which he then tells us is a matter for " (para?) psychology." But it isn't clear what this means, not at least in some ordinary sense of that expression, for in that sense, when ever I have a false belief there is a "discrepancy between my belief and the actual state of things." So it could not be that which puzzles us about the Moorean sentence. Tennessen's suggestion, let me repeat, is that an expression may, as it stands, and without interpre tation, appear to describe no thinkable (at the moment) state of affairs (where "thinkable" includes self-contradictions, but not only self-contradictions), but which expression ought not to be ruled out as senseless or nonsignificant, for all of that. It is that suggestion which I now wish to discuss. Another statement of this suggestion which I think Tennessen would find sympathetic is to be found in a book by a contemporary linguist, H. A. Gleason, who writes, While a sentence such as "The green absolute signals the ineffable hypotenuse" is grammatically quite acceptable (i.e., it follows a common syntactic pattern), it is quite unlikely to be said since no context is imaginable. But again, it is essential to the flexibility of language that utterances which cannot be foreseen in advance to be useful are possible. What would have been thought a century</page><page sequence="7">252 THE MONIST ago of a sentence like, "Light is both a particle and a wave"? All the vocabulary was available then. So was the syntactic pattern. But (such a sentence) would have probably been just as intelligible as that cited before it. If English could not have allowed an utterance like this, the growth of modern physics would have been severely hampered when the need to make such a statement did arise.6 Compare this with: We normally tend to avoid propounding obviously untenable hypoth eses or inadvisable proposals. We should never say: "the interior of Sirius is filled with mock-turtle" because Sirius is never filled with mock-turtle. However: if there were linguistic rules prohibiting all sentences which at time t, were unanimously interpreted to express untenable hypotheses ... the same rules would prohibit (or, at least, inhibit) effective communication at a time t', when the world had changed in such a way that certain "plain" (but interesting) matters of fact would be most adequately described (only) by em ploying some of the very (at time t) interdicted sentences. Take for example the sentence: "I had lunch at Oslo at noon and break fast the same day (two hours earlier) in San Francisco," and let t be 1869 and t' 1969. And add to this the fact that in many such cases the change of the world would entail a change in language. Not only is this true for technical inventions. . . . More important are the cases when locutions, commonly considered "contradictory" at t become common-place at t'; consider the expression: "to split an atom"! It would, by the same token, be silly of us to ban forever such an expression as: "a rate of speed exceeding the velocity of light" or the likeJ What is being argued here is that linguistic tolerance or "lati tudinarianism" should be practiced in the interests of the advance ment of knowledge, on the grounds that an attitude of restriction ism can, and has, been inhibiting to such advancement. What is not so clearly being argued by Gleason and Tennessen is just how far such tolerance can go without absurdity. One of the difficulties is Gleason's contention that 'The green absolute signals the ineffable ? . A.

Two questions arise here: (1) Why is "grammatical acceptability" a necessary condition of significance, as is clearly implied? (2) What is the criterion of "grammatical acceptability," and is such a criterion independent of questions of meaning? 1. Is there some a priori reason for demanding grammaticality as a necessary condition of meaningfulness? It is hard to think of any that are not question-begging, e.g., if the expression were not at least grammatical we could not even begin to understand it. It is this that leads one to think that questions 1 and 2 are not separable, and so leads one to answer the second part of question 2 above with a 'no', as has been suggested by some recent discussions in linguis tics.8 But I shall not discuss these questions here. Now there has been some suggestion that the idea of "grammati cality" might be so extended as to reduce all questions of meaning fulness to questions of grammaticalness. A suggestion to that effect is made by Hillary Putnam, who holds that ". . . the line between semantics and grammar is a matter of convenience and not a genu ine theoretical question at all,"9 so that many (all?) kinds of meaningfulness could be understood as violations of grammatical rules. There are, of course, well known methodological difficulties, e.g., ad hocness, involved in this approach. In any case, I shall assume for the purpose of this paper, that unless the notion of grammaticality is trivialized, grammaticality, although a necessary condition of meaningfulness, is not sufficient. And I shall also assume that it is also a necessary condition of meaningfulness, although not sufficient, that the constituents of meaningful expres sion are recognizable words so that such an expression as, Trumble is psyfuming' will not be meaningful. I recognized the difficulties in these two assumptions, e.g. (1) there might be meaningful expres sions containing neologisms, and (2) the questions of 'wordhood' 8 Here see J. Fodor and J. J. Katz, eds., The Structure of Language (Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1964), especially selections 3, 4, 12, 13, and 14. 9 Hillary Putnam, "Some Issues in the Theory of Grammar," Proc. of Symposia in Applied Mathematics, Vol. XII (Providence, R. I.: American Mathematical Society, 1961) .</page><page sequence="9">254 THE MONIST and grammaticality are not all that separate,1 o still, I shall make them for present purposes. It seems to me that the most plausible way of understanding the Tennessen-Gleason thesis is in terms of some notion of 'potential meaning*. All that means, really, is that instead of holding that some expressions are meaningful, and some expressions are mean ingless, one should, instead, hold that some expressions are mean ingful at some time t, while some expressions, viz. any fulfilling the two conditions that they are 'grammatically acceptable* and have constituents which are words, and not nonsense sounds or marks, ought to be viewed with tolerance. Since in the future, situations may arise for which they will be appropriately descriptive, and, moreover, there is no a priori way of telling that no such situation will arise, simply by examining the expression in question. All expressions which are not now meaningful, will, in this way, be said to have potential meaning. Is there any advantage, however, in talking in this way? Now there is, in recent philosophical literature, a view that is very similar to that just expressed. Smart describes it as follows: Indeed, it may be precisely because out words mean what they do mean that we may come to change some of our locutions, e.g., to locate consciousness in the brain, not as a matter of metaphysical theory . . . but as a matter of course, as common sense. Hilary Putnam, influenced by Paul Ziff points out that a new way of talking may arise because of the old standard use of the words in question: a change in the conceptual context in which these words are used may indeed almost force a change in language habits. This is very different from arbitrarily giving a new use to a word.11 The view that Smart describes in the passage just quoted is, it seems to me, very similar to the kind of position taken by Tennessen and Gleason and I would like to treat it as an interesting version of it. Clearly there are problems of interpretation which come up in this 10 For instance, "The Absolute Is Perfect." Is there a word 'absolute which is a noun} (There is a word 'absolute' which is an adjective, of course.) I am in debted to Herbert Heidelberger for this point. 11 Smart, op. cit., p. 98. Smart here refers to Putnam's "Could Mental States Be Brain Processes?" Journal of Philosophy, 63 (1961) , 813-22, and to Ziff, op. cit. See also, H. Putnam, "Minds and Machines/* in Dimensions of Mind, ed. Sidney Hook (New York: Collier Books, 1961), especially pp. 153-59.</page><page sequence="10">LINGUISTIC RESTRICTIONISM 255 newer version. Just how new are 'new ways of talking', e.g., 'Con sciousness is in the brain' or 'He is halfway through his dream'? Again, to take another example from Putnam,12 viz., am a thou sand miles away from you' how 'new' a way of talking is this? This latter example seems to differ in important respects from the other two just cited. After all, it is only the spoken version of this sentence that presents any problems, for it would, I take it, have been easy enough for someone in, say, the south of England to send a written version of this sentence in a letter to someone in the north of Scotland. Even in the spoken version, one need not imagine the invention of the telephone in order to understand the sentence, for it is possible to imagine someone possessing a thunderous voice. In the sense that 'Consciousness is in the brain' or 'He is halfway through his dream' does seem to be a new way of talking, ami thousand miles from you' does not seem to be. The difficulty is not that 'linguistic deviancy' is simply a matter of degree as is implied, it is also a matter of kind, i.e., there are different kinds of 'linguistic deviancy' within which there are degrees. am a thousand miles away from you' is no more a new way of talking or, if you like, just as much of a new way of talking, as is Tennessen's have a swan in my closet'. Putnam, I think, assimilates them because he holds (and I shall return to this point presently), that a new way of talking is instituted simply by new "ways of telling," i.e., empirical procedures which, having been discovered, constitute the sense of a novel expression. Next, note that if by a 'change in the conceptual context', Smart, Putnam, and Ziff have in mind, as they seem to, a change in the conceptual context of science, then it would seem that theologi cal and some metaphysical expressions cannot be fitted into the theory that they present. One might be tempted to exempt Ziff here because in Semantic Analysis he argues that the utterances that contemporary philosophers have scored as "devoid of significance are not devoid of significance. The utterances they say are incom prehensible are not incomprehensible."13 Ziff goes on to say, Metaphysicians and theologians are generally no harder to under stand than poets or novelists. There is as much philosophical rub 12 Putnam, "Minds and Machines," p. 154. 13 Ziff, op. cit.</page><page sequence="11">256 THE MONIST bish in Dostoevski and Kierkegaard as there is in Hegel and Heideg ger. The difference between a work of metaphysics and Finnegan9s Wake is that what is said in the former is likely to be false when interesting and platitudinous when true, whereas such questions are not likely to arise in connection with the latter.14 However, in what he next says, Ziff takes the "change in conceptual context" line described already, where the instances of expressions once held to be "deviant" or "devoid of significance" which he gives are those which "assume" significance within a scientific framework. E.g., "At exactly what moment during the time that he was sound asleep did the dream occur?"15 So from what he says here, it is not clear what he would hold concerning theological and other puta tively nonscientific expressions. For, if we can talk of an expression as having potential meaning only if that sentence takes on meaning as a consequence of a change in the conceptual context, where 'conceptual context* refers to the conceptual context of science, then the status of nonscientific expressions is still left in doubt if we wish to distinguish among them between those that are meaningful as they stand, and those that are only 'potentially* meaningful. Now, in another place,16 Ziff does discuss the question of the meaningfulness of theological expressions, such as 'God exists*, and holds that if "the plain man's" conception of God has associated with it the condition of omnipotence, then since it conflicts with a tenet of present physics that no physical object can attain a velocity greater than that of light, since in that case, no being could, e.g., transport a stone from the earth to the sun in one second, then according to present-day physics, 'God is omnipotent* is false, and so certainly meaningful.17 Now here, of course, a theological ex pression is understood as being true or false within the scientific conceptual framework. But it is dubious that any theologian would be willing to understand 'God is omnipotent* in this way, for the reason Paul Edwards gives in his criticism of Ziff on this point,18 14 Ibid. 15 Ibid. 16Paul Ziff, "About 'God,'" in Religious Experience and Truth, ed. Sidney Hook (New York: New York University Press, 1961), pp. 195-202. Ibid., p. 202. 18 Paul Edwards, "Some Notes on Anthropomorphic Theology," in Hook, Religious Experience and Truth, p. 248.</page><page sequence="12">LINGUISTIC RESTRICTIONISM 257 namely, the notion of a miracle would be invoked. But to do that would be to refuse to allow 'God is omnipotent' to have meaning within the conceptual framework of science. (Hume's discussion of miracles long ago argued that the notion of a miracle cannot be made sense of in the context of natural law.) The issue raised by the above considerations is not, of course, a new one. A good many philosophers have held that nonscientific expressions "have their own logic" and that it is a mistake to consider their meaningfulness as dependent upon whether they can be understood as fitting into the scientific context. As a result, there really seem to be two issues raised by the question of 'potential meaning'. (1) Can an expression which cannot be understood, nevertheless be said to have 'potential meaning' on the grounds that changes within the conceptual context of science would be such that the expression in question 'acquires' meaning? (2) Can an expression which cannot be understood, nevertheless be said to have 'potential' meaning even though the expression is conceded to be nonscientific? Each of these questions raises a problem of clarifica tion. The first one raises a problem centered about the sense to be given to 'acquiring meaning', for something is intended that lies in between an arbitrary stipulation or assignment of meaning to the expression, on the one hand, and an expression's already having meaning on the other. Putnam, in an article I have already referred to,19 clearly wants to maintain that there is this something "in between," in which an expression which previously had no use, "acquires" a use which may be the product of "new theoretical knowledge," but which is, he writes, . . not arbitrary,. . . not the product of stipulation, but represented an automatic projection from the existing stock uses of the several words making up the sentence, given a new context." But, although I am sympathetic to what Putnam says here, I find his explanation of what he means very obscure. For instance, Putnam criticizes Malcolm for saying that for the expression 'He is halfway through his dream' to have a use, it would have to be given z. use, i.e., a use would have to be stipulated for that expression. Rather, writes Putnam, the correct account would be that, the sentence did not previously have a use because we had no way ? Putnam, "Minds and Machines," p. 154.</page><page sequence="13">258 THE MONIST of telling when dreams start and stop. Now we are beginning to have ways of telling, and so we are beginning to find occasions upon which it is natural to employ this sentence.20 But there are well-known difficulties which arise as soon as one thinks about Putnam's account of the situation, as he has just expressed it. It is not simply a question of just how, or indeed whether, such expressions as 'His dream has stopped*, 'His dream has just started*, 'He is halfway through his dream* can be 'pro jected* from some description of language ('language* here mean ing what De Saussure meant by 'langue* and not 'parole*). A question which seems to me to be more basic, and to raise very deep issues, arises when we consider what Putnam might mean when he writes that a sentence which previously had no use, acquires a use when we begin to have "ways of telling" when dreams start and stop. There is a peculiarity in what Putnam says which does not, perhaps, immediately come to mind if we regard the situation he is discussing on the model of comparatively trivial cases in science where the expression and the concept already exist, and there is the conceptually unimportant matter of inventing "ways of telling" whether the expression in question is applicable or not. For exam ple, I take it that at one time we were unable to tell what was the velocity of sound waves, and then, having invented the proper instruments, we were able to do so. But it seems clear that what Putnam is describing is not an analogous situation. In no obvious sense had we either the expressions in question or the concepts of dreams starting and stopping, etc. I take it that Malcolm's point in his little book Dreaming,21 is that what Putnam calls ways of telling that someone's dream has just started, etc., have to be shown to be ways of telling that, and not something quite unrelated. It is not simply a matter of the expressions, but of the concepts "embod ied" in those expressions. How do we know that any way of telling which is said to be a way of telling that, e.g., a dream has started is a way of telling that! Perhaps this question embodies a confusion, but it is not obvious to me that it does. In order to invent "ways of telling" when dreams start, stop, etc., it seems to me that we must priorly have formed the concepts of dreams taking place in time, 20 ibid., p. 155. 21 . Malcolm, Dreaming (New York: Humanities Press, 1959).</page><page sequence="14">LINGUISTIC RESTRICTIONISM 259 etc. Perhaps Putnam would be willing to answer here that such a concept is already "contained in" or is "implicit" in our ordinary concept of dreaming, and perhaps this is true, whatever it may mean in so nebulous a formulation, but if he does, then it would seem that my question would not be confused, but requires an answer. Let me try to bring my point home with another (fabricated) example. It might be asked whether it makes sense to talk of an indi vidual sleeping faster than another individual. Should we say that although we do not have ways of telling whether A sleeps faster than B, we may develop such ways, so that there is no reason to deny that the expression sleeps faster than B' makes sense? But we should ask once again, how will we recognize that such a "way of telling" is really a way of telling that} For all we know we already have such a wray of telling, e.g., A can be said to sleep faster than if A and sleep the same length of time and A wakes up feeling more refreshed than B. After all, would it not be reasonable to hold that if A feels more refreshed than B, having slept the same amount of time as B, he got more sleep into the same time, and so slept faster? Talking this way seems 'natural* enough, especially if we construe 'sleeping faster' on the model of 'eating faster*. The point becomes starker if we reflect that on the other hand, it is as 'natural* to hold that a 'way of telling* whether A has slept faster than would be to ask the question whether A, having slept the same amount of time as did B, awakens feeling less refreshed and wearier than B, for, after all, he had to cover more ground in the same time. Both 'ways of telling* seem equally natural, and they give contrary results. Which concept, if a concept is 'given* by a 'way of telling* is then implicit or contained in our concept of 'sleep*? The question then, does not seem to me whether we have the language, or can get it, and perhaps not even whether we can get the concepts, but rather how we can be sure that the right expressions are 'married' to the right concepts. In the example I have just given, it would seem that there is a twofold problem: for even if we decide on a way of telling when A has slept faster than which is not simply a stipulation inasmuch as the concept of A sleeping faster than is somehow already implicit in our concept of sleep, the problem which arises is how we decide that the linguistic expression 'sleeping faster' is the correct expression for that concept. There is, I recognize, a tendency in recent philosophy to consider this sort of question a pseudo-ques</page><page sequence="15">260 THE MONIST tion. The following passage from Wittgenstein's Philosophical In vestigations expresses this tendency: When I think in language, there aren't "meanings" going through my mind in addition to the verbal expressions: the language is itself the vehicle of thought.22 Our concepts, according to this view, are not 'naked* awaiting well-fitting linguistic adornment, for thought and language are inseparable. This is no place to try to discuss so difficult a question. The view Wittgenstein expresses in the above passage does not seem to me to be obviously true, and there seems some reason to think it is too far reaching. It seems to me that I very often have concepts for which I (sometimes in vain) look for proper expressions in lan guage. In any case, it seems to me that the sort of theory advocated by Putnam and others which I have been discussing contains prob lems which they have not recognized, and which I have tried to make explicit. I now want to turn briefly to a question which I have raised earlier. Even if the Putnam et al. version of the Tennessen Gleason thesis could be made out for expression within the "con ceptual context of science" so that it could be held that expressions without any clear meaning at the present have 'potential meaning* in that as a result of changes in science, such expressions would 'acquire* meaning as a 'natural* extension of already existing concepts and as a natural projection of already existing linguistic forms and vocabulary, we must still ask whether it makes sense to hold a comparable theory for expressions which lie outside the empirical framework. What gives pause here, however, is that whereas we have some idea of how changes in the conceptual framework of science are effected, and are indeed, quite inevitable given the nature of science, it is not at all clear how such changes in nonscientific frameworks are effected, or, indeed whether they exist. Within the scientific framework conceptual changes are instituted by new discoveries difficult or impossible to accommodate within the old framework, or by the recognition of relationships not hith erto recognized. Does anything of the kind occur within say, theol ogy? Apparently, yes, and a recent instance is the death of God movement in protestant theology. If we take the expression 'God is 22 L. Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, I (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1953), 329.</page><page sequence="16">LINGUISTIC RESTRICTIONISM 261 dead', it would have, unless interpreted to mean that people no longer believe in God, or that the belief in God is not an important influence on action, been said to be meaningless in the context of Christian theology. But revisions in recent Christian theology seem to have created a meaning for the expression which is not stipula tive. Since the demise of the verifiability principle, little attention has been paid to the broad questions of meaningfulness, although con temporary philosophers have continued to assume that some signifi cant distinction between meaningfulness and meaninglessness could be drawn. I have tried in this paper to interpret the problem in terms of 'potential meaning*, and have also tried to indicate some of the difficulties which still await solution. K.
