EXHIBITION REVIEW Prints: Flavin, Judd, Sandback By Allison Rudnick " Prints : Flavin , Judd, Sandback " David Zwirner, New York 14 January-i March 2014 In Objects," 1965 Donald an article Judd published that explained "Specific "the Objects," an article that explained "the new three-dimensional work" then being produced by a cohort of like-minded artists.1 Unlike conventional painting and sculpture, which Judd proclaimed to have served the purpose of a "container," the new work was about the object itself. Eschewing pictorial devices, the artists, known today as Minimalists, empha- sized the dimensional, physical presence of the thing for its ability to "[open] up to anything." Almost 50 years later, it is three-dimensional objects that are cited in exhibitions and texts as the clearest exemplars of Minimalist aesthetics. Perhaps it is the ubiquity of Minimal- ist sculpture in museums of modern art that rendered an encounter with "Prints: Flavin, Judd, Sandback" at David Zwirner so remarkable. The intimate format and substances of the print might seem antithetical to Minimalism's embrace of industrial materials and its empha- sis on the nonpictorial object. But the exhibition, which presented prints made between 1961 and 1994, demonstrated that print enabled these artists to reach further in their investigations of mate- rial, space and seriality. The earliest prints in the show were woodcuts made by Judd in 1961. One unpublished work, printed by the art- ist's father, Roy C. Judd, was made by inking a plywood wall sculpture with black ink and printing it onto vellum.2 Cadmium red oil paint was then applied to the verso, resulting in a square image with a granular texture through which a linear, somewhat anthropomorphic, red, four-limbed form appears. The print is an index of a turning point in the artist's career: Judd abandoned painting in favor of sculpture in the early 1960s. The geo- metric form that reveals itself within the inky surface of the print anticipates the aesthetic that would occupy Judd for the remainder of his life. 30 Art in Print May - June 2014</page><page sequence="2">Donald Judd, Untitled (Schellmann 157-166) (1988), Set of ten woodcuts printed in cadmium red light on Japanese woven paper Okawara, 23 5/8x31 1/2 inches each.

Courtesy of David Zwimer, New York/London. Paradigmatic of Judd's later work are two sets of ten woodcuts from 1988, one printed in black and the other in cad- mium red. Identical in size, the rectilin- ear surfaces of the prints are divided into modular units. Each set is arranged in two vertical rows of five prints; the prints in one row are mirror images of those directly adjacent. The distinctive grainy wooden surface has been replaced by flat, unvarying planes of ink. The works relate to Judd's canonical stacked boxes in both arrangement as well as process: as with the galvanized-iron and stainless steel boxes, Judd essentially outsourced the labor for the woodcuts, sending printers instructions that included sheet dimen- sions and exactly how the blocks should be divided.3 Traces of the artisťs process are circumvented, and the inherent prop- erties of the objects are emphasized. Whereas Judd favored the woodcut, Flavin was represented by lithographs and intaglio prints. In 1963 Flavin aban- doned all media but fluorescent light and works on paper, through which he has single-mindedly pursued the power of light, form and space.4 Two untitled, double-sided color aquatints from 1994 articulate these concerns: each side of the circular handmade paper is printed in a different color, to which the aquatint technique lends a particular luminosity, and the paper is then rolled and stitched into cylindrical forms. As sculptural objects that resemble the fluorescent tubes that are his signature material, the prints embody his fascination with reductive form and color. Just as striking are two near-identical color aquatints of 1988, printed and published by Aldo Crommelynck, the legendary printer best known for his col- laborations with Pablo Picasso. Bothprints are composed of an arresting red ground accented by a black triangle in the upper- right corner, but in one a diagonal slice has been taken out of the left edge. Titled for K. Malevich 1 and 2, the works, with their bold red planes punctuated by diagonal forms in black and white, are homages to the great Russian Suprematist who pio- neered full geometric abstraction. Sandback, who is best known for sculptures and installations that used yarn to delineate shapes in space, favored linear print techniques such as etching and linoleum. The results are delicate, sometimes exquisite, small-scale prints, most in black and white. A set of four etchings of 1976 seems to test the limits of how few marks are required to evoke the illusion of depth on a flat surface. Each print contains two black lines in a variety of simple, diagonal configura- tions. While his installations employ linear configurations of yarn to suggest flat planes in three-dimensional space, the prints employ linear etched marks to suggest three-dimensional space on a flat plane. Far from occupying a secondary place in his oeuvre, printmaking allowed Sandback to explore complex figure- ground relationships through distinctive means. The exhibition at David Zwirner expands the conventional narrative of Minimalism to encompass a greater vari- ety of media and materials (and decades). It also corrects the misperception that Minimalism was practiced by artists with unwavering allegiance to dogma. The prints of Flavin, Judd and Sandback reveal ongoing experimentation with formats, techniques and materials throughout the artists' careers. ■ Allison Rudnick is a Ph.D. student in art history at the Graduate Center, City University of New York.
