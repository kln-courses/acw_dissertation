<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LIMITS OF RELIGIOUS COERCION IN MID-COLONIAL PERU* Christ's injunction to go forth and teach all nations is forthright and clear. But the interpretation of his further instruction to compel them to enter the Christian fold is more problematic.1 Does coercion lead to genuine conversion, or does it instead encourage dissimulation and feigned Christianity? Such questions deeply troubled many of the clergy and members of the religious orders who were involved in the evangelization of Spanish America in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Ideally (it was hoped) the conversion of indigenous peoples would come through their exposure to the natural appeal of Christian truths and teaching. While coercion was allowed, American conditions required that it be restricted. It was limited because Indians were regarded as new converts, deficient in intel- lectual capacity and especially vulnerable to the wiles of the Devil, but also because they were subjects of the Spanish crown. The great Dominican professor of theology at the University of Salamanca, Francisco de Vitoria (c. 1485-1546), developed lengthy arguments about the Spanish right to convert the native peoples * An earlier version of this essay was presented to the session on "Europeans and Native Americans" at the Anglo-American Conference for Historians, London, 7-10 July 1992.

Churchmen grew impatient with their Indian charges as hopes for a New Jerusalem faded.4 Faced early with religious resistance from powerful Indian opponents and also with more widespread cases of apparent subterfuge and duplicity among the newly converted, many regular and secular officials - including even Zumarraga himself - abandoned patience and restraint in favour of repression.5 Accustomed as they were to 2 See Francisco de Vitoria, "On the American Indians (De Indis)" and "Lecture on the Evangelization of Unbelievers", in Francisco de Vitoria, Political Writings, ed.

The constitutions of the First Council of Lima (1551-2) simultaneously forbade and sanctioned the use of force in evangel- ization.6 Moreover, the dividing line between instruction, moral regulation and outright coercion is far from clear in the response of evangelizers to the challenges they faced in the Indian parishes.7 A well-documented series of ecclesiastical investigations under- taken intermittently in the Indian parishes of the archdiocese of Lima between 1640 and 1750 provides extraordinary opportunit- ies to explore further the relationship between religious coercion8 6 R.

The first part of this essay introduces the forces in contention in this part of the seventeenth-century Andes: on the one hand, the "idolatry inspections" (visitas de idolatria) and their machinery of coercion, and on the other, post-evangelization Andean religion. The second part turns to the idolatry documentation for points of entry into this complex and often ambiguous world of confronta- tion and encounter, more than a century after the arrival of the Spanish in Peru. My particular concentration on the principal punitive and consecratory operations within a larger process of religious repression reveals much about both Spanish intentions and Andean responses. While it proves impossible to construct a simple model to explain exactly what different approaches to evangelization were achieving or what constituted "idolatry" in the mid-colonial central Andes,9 this religious information offers valuable insight into the minds of the extirpators and strongly suggests what some of the most important regional manifestations of Andean religion were becoming. Religious change was occurring slowly, fitfully and, from the point of view of the agents of Christianization, sometimes "in reverse".10 The Indian peoples of the Lima region, who were collectively to have been resettled and reoriented by generations of priests and administrators, were becoming parishioners. But they were doing so on their own terms, within the bounds of local relationships that included parish priests as well as "unoffi- (n. 8 cont.) hechiceros y rebeldes (Chancay, siglo XVII), ed. A.

A useful synthesis and a way forward are offered in W. B. Taylor, Magistrates of the Sacred: Priests and Parishioners in Eighteenth-Century Mexico (Stanford, forthcoming), ch. 3.

The Indians' accommodation to new, colonial pressures (and Christianity was but one of these) did not force the abandonment of trusted gods and practices. By the end of the first decade of the seventeenth century, the confidence of the Catholic church in the success of its efforts to convert the peoples of the archdiocese of Lima, Peru, to a stead- fast and orthodox Christian faith was severely shaken. The Indians' attachment to their own religious system had been, as the contemporary rhetoric put it, "discovered" or "unmasked"; a secretive and vile "idolatry" had been revealed beneath the guise of proper Christian acceptance. The main thrust of efforts at evangelization in this part of the Andes was about to change. The predominantly missionary-style and parish-centred instruc- tion of Indians was being superseded by a new obsession with the place of idolatry in the lives of baptized Indians. Official support grew quickly for a systematic and forceful initiative to solve the widespread problem of religious error and to continue the absorption of the Indians into Christendom.11 The process which developed to meet the new needs and express the change of will was "the Extirpation of idolatry".12 The Extirpation amounted to a series of inquisitorial investi- gations held in a succession of parishes. Specially commissioned and empowered visitadores de idolatria invited individual confes- sions of guilt and denunciations of other religious offenders. Along with a range of punishments for the guilty, an idolatry visitation also meant a time of intense instruction for the Andean communit- ies. In the eyes of its theoreticians and apologists, the Extirpation represented the perfect blend of the pedagogical, judicial and penal measures needed to lead relapsed Christian Indians back into the fold. Depending largely on the inclinations of successive prelates in Lima and on the persuasiveness of the many provincial " The most important Peruvian precedent was the investigation of Albornoz into the Taki Onqoy (see n. 5 above).

In some instances, its authority extended (though much more sporadically) into the first half of the eighteenth. Treatises on Indian religious error calling for the eradication of idolatry were written by contemporary churchmen in other parts of Spanish America (most notably New Spain), but unlike the manuals and other anti-idolatry material from seventeenth-century Peru, these were not accompanied by cam- paigns of investigation and punishment.13 Despite the flaws in its organization and execution, its intermittent existence and its marked dependence on the patronage of certain archbishops and viceroys, the Peruvian Extirpation was the most systematic attempt ever made in colonial Spanish America to repress Indian religion and uproot its alleged perversions of Catholicism.14 The tenure of Archbishop Pedro de Villagomez of Lima (1641-71) represented a critical moment in the church's struggle with Andean religion. Villag6mez revitalized the Extirpation in the middle of the seventeenth century after it had been out of favour for almost three decades.15 Yet even though Villagomez's 13 An adequate study comparing New Spain and Peru in light of these differences remains to be written.

The same period also saw the rise of some compelling doubts and fears. There was opposition - both in the Lima region and beyond - to this return to systematic persecution.16 Much of the disag- reement hinged on what measure of force should accompany the continuing evangelization of Indians. The Society of Jesus went so far as to withdraw from official participation in the idolatry campaigns in the 1650s, citing, as one of their provincials put it, "reasons of some weight". Jesuit reservations can be seen as part of a constant fluctuation of opinion among contemporary church- men on the difficult issue of the most effective means of eradicat- ing persistent Andean religion.'7 The Jesuits had supervised the instruction and detention of the principal religious offenders since the beginning of campaigns in second decade of the seventeenth century. Most importantly, they had always accompanied the idolatry inspections. Their refusal to do so came at a crucial moment, depriving Villag6mez's renewed Extirpation of its most gifted teachers just when the Jesuits' unrivalled contemporary reputation for effective evangelization among the Indians was most needed. For the Indians, once the Jesuit presence was removed, the punitive aspects of the Extirpation came to the fore. Although a visitador de idolatria was meant to preach, hear confession and direct the reformation of individuals, he could not escape the fact that he visited the Indian parishes primarily as a judge. Moreover, to a number of significant contemporary (n. 15 cont.)

See especially the treatises of J. Perez Bocanegra, Ritual formulario e institucion de curas para administrar a los naturales de este reyno (Lima, 1631); A. de la Peiia Montenegro, Itinerario para parochos de indios (Madrid, 1668). 17 Some padres felt that their collaboration with the visitadores' punitive actions was undermining their position as trusted confessors and missionaries in the eyes of the Indians: see the interpretations of R. Vargas Ugarte, Historia de la Iglesia en el Perzi, 5 vols. (Lima and Burgos, 1953-62), iii, pp. 9-11; Duviols, Destruccidn de las religiones andinas, pp. 225-30. Although an equivalent of the Extirpation did not materialize in seventeenth-century New Spain, a similar oscillation and multiplicity of opinion can be detected there: see Gruzinski, Conquest of Mexico, ch. 4, esp. pp. 147-8. 90 NUMBER 145 PAST AND PRESENT</page><page sequence="8">RELIGIOUS COERCION IN MID-COLONIAL PERU churchmen,18 the Extirpation's commitment to forceful measures and a harsh rhetoric of dissuasion all but cancelled its reason for existence - namely, its reformative aims. Perhaps an excessive dose of juridical force was being administered at precisely the time when only more intensive and vigilant efforts at Christian instruction could save the Indians from perpetual error and the damnation that came with it. More worrying still, from the point of view of the church in Lima, was the possibility that the visitas de idolatria might further frustrate the already uneven effects of the Catholic mission in this part of Spanish America. Tactics like those being employed by the Extirpation might be partly responsible for Indian religious survival. For, in spite of the triumphal tone of the official corres- pondence and of the anti-idolatry treatises, the effects of coercion, forceful dissuasion and harsh punishment were unpredictable.19 The elaborate edifice of justification which Archbishop Villag6mez and others had built upon the reformative elements in the idolatry investigations was clearly meant to disarm concern and criticism.20 Yet the programmes of instruction were consist- ently overshadowed by coercive actions. The visitadores' punitive and destructive operations during the course of their idolatry investigations, usually known as diligencias, were central to the intended reform of the parishes of the mid-colonial archdiocese of Lima. By means of such actions, religious offenders could be isolated by the Spanish authorities in order to be disciplined and ridiculed before their own people, and the so-called instruments of idolatry, the false gods, the ancestors' remains and the sacrificial materials, could be physically destroyed. Yet it was what the performance of the diligencias was meant to achieve which is most important. Nothing was thought to be more instructive for the Indians, or more symbolic of their spiritual fate, than the religious spectacles that featured the destruction of their forbidden cults. Accordingly, almost all idolatry trials featured diligencias of some description. Often, these operations were the culmination of a visita's stay 18 See n. 16 above. '9 P. Duviols has suggested that the exemplary punishment and exile of "idolatrous" leaders by the Extirpation accomplished exactly the opposite of what was intended: Duviols, "De la inquisici6n a la extirpaci6n", p. lxxvi. 20 P. de Villag6mez, Carta pastoral de exortaci6n e instrucci6n acerca de las idolatrias de los indios del arzobispado de Lima (1649), ed.

And there were autos de fe at which any object both idolatrous and transportable would be burned before the people who had been assembled in the local plazas. 21 Most of the idolatry investigations conformed to a pattern. A Spaniard - or occasionally a Hispanicized Indian - prosecutor (fiscal) assisted the visitador in making the principal charges, apprehending offenders and gathering witnesses. Although many priest-visitadores understood (to varying degrees) the kind of Quechua spoken by most of the declarants, an interpreter was usually present. He was often a co-operative Indian assigned by the visitador to travel with the visita for a time, though he might instead be the fiscal performing double duty. A notary, familiar with the established pattern of procedure, completed the official entourage. It was not uncommon for a number of local officials to establish themselves as key informants and "friends of the visita". Their motives were potentially many, but their concern for self-protection is frequently easy to discern. Observing the lessons of Inquisition procedure, these latter figures were the very "opening wedges" that in 1621 the shrewd Arriaga had deemed essential for the Extirpation's success: J. de Arriaga, La extirpaci6n de la idolatria en el Peru, ed. H. H. Urteaga (Colecci6n de libros y documentos referentes a la historia del Perii, 2nd ser., i, Lima, 1920), pp. 132-6. For more on the pattern of Extirpation procedure, Duviols, Destrucci6n de las religiones andinas, ch. 3, is still indispensable. The imitation of Inquisition methods, adjusted to suit Indian offenders, is clear: see H. C. Lea, A History of the Inquisition in Spain, 4 vols. (New York, 1906-7), iii, bk 7, esp. ch. 5; H. C. Lea, A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages, 3 vols. (New York, 1888), i, chs. 9, 12-14; H. Kamen, Inquisition and Society in Spain in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (Bloomington, 1985), ch. 10. See also n. 8 above. 22 The public nature of the punishment of Andean rebels and religious offenders had roots, not only in Europe, but in symbolic castigations in sixteenth-century Peru. For a discussion of the execution of the last Inka rebel Tupac Amaru in 1572, and on the processions of shame used by Albornoz in his suppression of Taki Onqoy, see MacCormack, Religion in the Andes, pp. 249-54. 23 These practitioners were healers, diviners and workers of various kinds of "magic". The rites they performed might involve offerings to Andean gods; indeed, many of the specialists were also ministers.</page><page sequence="10">RELIGIOUS COERCION IN MID-COLONIAL PERU 93 The fact that memories of these destructive acts lingered so long is the greatest testimony to their brutal effect. Scholars have noted the power of similar recollections among indigenous peoples in New Spain.24 Andean declarants before visitadores in the 1660s frequently recalled in vivid detail the deeds of extirpators almost a half century before; the visits seem to have become negative reference points in the people's recollection of the past, remem- bered in much the same way as particularly bad droughts or the outbreaks of a killing disease.25 The practices which characterized the diligencias were a direct result of the church's determination to get across its message to the Indians through intensive catechizing, instruction, and - above all - by preaching against "idolatry".26 Their ostensible aim was to expound the basic tenets of the Catholic faith in such a way that the teaching (and the fear inspired by interrogation) would reawaken understanding and induce baptized Indians to return to the fold. But in practice this intense programme of instruction and preaching most often took second place to their efforts to refute and humiliate Andean spiritual leaders and to degrade what the churchmen took to be central aspects of Andean 24 S.

By using such words as "idolatry" and "superstition", and by ima- gining in terms of these categories, they devalued Indian efforts to manage the forces which were thought to permeate every aspect of life.29 Even as such simplifications and misperceptions persisted, the instruction employed by the Extirpation took the affront a step further. The Indians who ministered to the ancestral gods and who acted as repositories for ancient knowledge, together with those who were adept in divination, healing and magic,30 were subjected to two kinds of misrepresentation. The Indian spiritual elite were portrayed as servants of the Christians' Devil (who either inspired or directed their "idolatry") or else as evil char- latans who exploited the credulity of the masses for their own prestige and profit. Andean gods, whose significance and functions were changing in the colonial years, were even more crudely portrayed. Even allowing for the adaptation of these gods to the concerns of their seventeenth-century devotees, and for the scep- 27 See particularly the contemporary and widely disseminated sermons of H. de Avendafio: Sermones de los misterios de nuestra santa fe catdlica en lengua castellana y en la general del Inca impugnanse los errores particulares que los indios han tenido (Lima, 1649).

In a provocative representation of "the Indian view of things" in colonial New Spain, S. Gruzinski defends "idolatry" as the least restrictive and problematic among the host of unsatisfactory terms: Gruzinski, Conquest of Mexico, esp. pp. 150-1, 170-2. 30 In the colonial era, at least, the ministers and the ritual practitioners were often the same people. 94 NUMBER 145 PAST AND PRESENT</page><page sequence="12">RELIGIOUS COERCION IN MID-COLONIAL PERU ticism with which some Indians viewed Andean religious forces, such beings as the huacas maintained their relevance for most people in the highland Lima region. For many, huacas were ancestors who had turned to stone in a mythical past and who now represented eternal forces in the regional landscapes. The huacas' great deeds and contributions to society were a central part of local religion and of the festival cycle. Yet to the extirpator in his role as preacher, they became nothing more than "ugly rocks", regularly soiled by animals and little boys.31 Similarly, the conopas, sculpted and natural forms, often of stone, were, to many Andeans, mobile, personal founts of energy, fertility and good fortune. But by the preachers they were likened, no more sympathetically, to children's playthings and rag dolls.32 When it came to the teaching of the Christian faith, the elementary doc- trine classes were frequently offered not so much as opportunities for improved understanding, but as penalties for error, dull- wittedness and recalcitrance. The sentences decreed by the visitadores often included supervised terms in the children's daily doctrina classes for adult religious transgressors.33 Through public punishment, demolition of religious objects and places, and the attempted appropriation of immovable Andean huacas to Catholic purposes, the process of instruction through destruction and humiliation continued. Indeed, theatrical coercion became something of a constant even when the extirpat- ing prelate Villag6mez was no longer supporting a centralized initiative. There was, for instance, little difference between the methods of the idolatry inspector Felipe de Medina in Cajatambo in 1652 and those of Toribio de Mendizabal in Huarochiri in 31 Avendafio, Sermones de los misterios de nuestra santafe catolica, sermon II, fo. 20b. Other common spellings of huaca include wak'a and guaca. On these beings, see F.

Don Jer6nimo Julca was exiled to Lima and his home was burnt to the ground, "so that the others might see who had been a hechicero".35 In eighteenth- century Carampoma (Huarochiri), Mendizabal confronted the backsliding indigenous minister Juan de Rojas in a similar manner. After all the "idols" had been burned before the villagers' eyes in an auto de fe, Rojas's house was then flattened and "a cross was erected in memory".36 Similarly, in 1724 Pedro de Celis assembled four hundred Indians of all ages in the plaza of San Pedro de Pacho in Chancay to watch an auto de fe of cult objects, and in the course of the same investigation, Pedro Quiinones, the experienced minister of many Andean gods in neighbouring Pachangara, reported that on numerous occasions throughout his life he had been publicly whipped for his relapses into idolatry.37 An approach toward the eradication of Andean religion which historians have long associated mostly with the seventeenth- century campaigns of the Extirpation proves to be alive and well in the more sporadic initiatives of the eighteenth century. In spite of all their intended edification and solemnity, the mid- colonial diligencias revealed the most vulnerable point of the Extirpation: the point where idealism came face to face with reality. The results of the exercises were very different from the hopes that attended them. Common assumptions about the influ- ence of the Devil on Indian beliefs and practices, and preconcep- tions about Indian immorality and mental inferiority, proved serviceable to visitadores in the course of most idolatry trials. Enemies to the faith and to the advancement of Christianity in the Indian communities could be defined, interpreted on a familiar grid, and castigated accordingly. Theory and theological opinion supplied comfort to faith and fired the ambitions of extirpators whose rewards were often slight payment for the rigours of their labours in remote regions. But the "enemies" sometimes slipped 34 See the Map for the locations of these and other places discussed.

In the performance of their duties, extirp- ators of idolatry and their notaries, perhaps more than any other first-hand observers and recorders of the mid-colonial realities of the Andean world, were pushed outside the regulated, prejudi- cially constructed environments of the treatise or of a letter to a superior. In their operations the visitadores confronted ambiguous physical manifestations of a changing Indian religiosity that they imperfectly understood, yet were bound to obliterate. Granted, when their actions were complete, extirpators might retreat to the familiar domain of the written word. Many, as they defined the Indians' sins and pronounced sentence, were clearly reviewing the sheaves of Indian testimony from within the refuge offered by the established conceptual canon. But the notaries' accounts of the destructive excursions of the visitadores, read with care, can provide less scripted sources for the examination both of these events and of the information they contain. This exercise also enables us to focus on the religious situations they may have helped to create. Such an approach, while revealing the imperfec- tions of the extirpating operations, also leads us beyond the machinery of repression to a deeper consideration of the changing and emerging entities that constituted post-evangelization Andean religion. For there were occasions when the discoveries made in the course of extirpating operations or in their aftermath must have made the act of orthodox interpretation distinctly uncomfortable. It is worth recalling at this point that the Andean world had been much affected by over a century of Spanish domination. Disease, warfare, dislocation, the disruption of reciprocal patterns of eco- nomic exchange and social order, greater demands for labour and tribute being made from fewer people, occasional abandonment by Hispanicized Indian elites, had all taken their toll on Indian society.38 Most importantly for our purposes, the imposition of 38 On the population decline, see N.

Their initial introduction to Christianity had usually come through the teach- ing and example of mendicant friars and, after about 1570, of the Jesuits. Even in the Andes, where missionary numbers and enthusiasm were not those of early New Spain, many Indian communities had at least a fleeting contact during the sixteenth century with a more heterodox and experimental Christianity than that of later times. Moreover, as the crown's policy of racial segregation proved illusory, there was plenty of unofficial Christianization accompanying general cultural exchange. Increased opportunities for contact with Spaniards, mestizos and Africans and, most significantly for our purposes, with the diverse brands of Christianity they practised, offered Indians some inad- vertent religious direction.39 Because of its capacity to absorb and make something of its new influences, the Andean religious system emerged a good deal less impoverished than might have been expected. The trans- formations of Andean religious ideas and practices, and the indis- putable penetrations of Catholicism into an evolving Andean religious framework, seem, superficially, to have owed little to coercive tactics such as those of the Extirpation. Indeed, the institution pitted itself as much against alleged perversions of orthodoxy - what we might call popular Catholicism or emer- gent Andean Christianity - as against huaca worship and ritual "superstition". To employ an anachronistic image, at times the religiosity that was to be eradicated from the Indian parishes was, to its mid-colonial extirpators, something like the creature (n. 38 cont.) 1991), pp. 401-14; S.

What exactly the Indians believed was an unknown, and thus dangerous, monster - an inadvertent hybrid with recognizably Christian traits, for which the earlier mendicant orders and Jesuits, and ultimately the church itself, would find it difficult to deny at least part of the responsibility. It is the uneasy encounter between the extirpators' orthodox idealism and the realities of an increasingly complex, post- evangelization Andean religion that is so often revealed in the course of a diligencia, particularly the kind of diligencia that sent solemn excursions into the Andean hinterland to destroy and appropriate Andean huacas and other sacred places. For at few points were the agents of the Extirpation more exposed to the limits and realities of both Catholic efficacy and Indian religion than when its agents ventured away from the churches, plazas and grid-pattern streets of the resettled Indian pueblos in pursuit of their investigations. The image of the extirpators leaving the familiar order of the resettled villages is an important one. Their excursions possessed a symbolic equivalence to the spate of church-building, resettle- ment and town foundation that had gripped Andean Peru about a century before.40 The towns and cities were designed to do more than make Europeans feel at home. The ambitious urbaniza- tion, as well as assisting tribute collection and the organization of Indian labourers, sought to extend a Hispanic brand of civilization among the newly converted. The Indians were meant to be drawn in wonder to these designs, to fall upon their knees in pious awe beneath the arches of the churches they themselves had built for a new god. But the patterned Christian environments in the Andes, the ordered centres sweeping rectilineally outwards from the village plazas and church faqades, began to dissipate at the edges. The organization into towns had wrought changes in Indian society which, however striking in their economic effects, are 40 For an interesting contemplation of the meaning of architecture and town founda- tion for Spanish builders, friars and residents, see V. Fraser, The Architecture of Conquest: Building in the Viceroyalty of Peru, 1535-1635 (Cambridge, 1990). Important connections between urbanization and evangelization were convincingly made almost fifty years ago by George Kubler, Mexican Architecture of the Sixteenth Century, 2 vols.

In the arch- diocese of Lima at least, many Indians had been resettled not far from their ancestors' plots of land, their mythical places of origin (pacarinas), their physical and spiritual homes. The ancient settle- ments which the notaries called pueblos viejos (old towns),41 often near to the huacas and the machayes or cave tombs of the malquis, remained well within reach. Moreover, the resettlement of peoples into villages and towns (reducciones de indios), especially by the viceroy Francisco de Toledo in the years after about 1570, had not always been successful. For example, the idolatry inspector Juan Sarmiento de Vivero wrote from Guafiec in the province of Yauyos in 1660, complaining of Indians who had been absent from their resettled communities for some twenty years, living instead in the ravines and high plateaux of Paria Caca.42 The seventeenth-century extirpators learned much about the persistence of religious, social and economic connections between the people and the surrounding landscape in the Lima region. Irrespective of how much of this information could be appreciated by active extirpators, it was clear - even to the crusading Christian - that in the post-conquest years the Indians' contact with their rich ancestral mythology and with the fundamental dimensions of their religious system had been strained, but not broken.43 The aim of the Extirpation's diligencias was thus to finish a drawn-out task, to sever these roots - in some cases quite literally, as we shall observe below. When visitadores penet- rated the more remote reaches and climbed to the pueblos viejos, their actions - at once destructive and consecratory - were 41 There is not space here to explain in sufficient detail the people's connections to these places.

A purpose and an idealism that one century earlier would have prompted a pair of friars to press for a local labour force to build an adobe church in a newly founded village, had come to require solemn forays into the countryside to fell idols, peer into caves, dig up bones and erect tall crosses. My attention to the shift in emphasis between the different kinds of pastoral activity (evangelization and extirpation) is not meant to compress an intricate and uneven process into a tidy, dichotomous package. Persuasion coexisted with force, both before and after some churchmen grew disillusioned with the prospect of genuine Indian conversions.44 Destructive actions against indigenous shrines and the raising of crosses had gone on since the first entradas - the rapid, surprise entries of the Spanish conquerors into unknown lands. And efforts at peaceful conver- sion and sustained religious instruction were pursued in the seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries. My point is to emphasize the comparable spirit of early colonial efforts at Christianization and the diligencias of the middle colonial period. The analogy works in at least two ways, and spurs us to think about how churchmen viewed both the towns they lived in and the Andean countryside. Like the person who organized the building of a first church or who rode in a conquering expedition, the seventeenth-century extirpator on a diligencia participated in a new beginning, a poten- tial triumph in foreign territory. In his mind at least, a visitador's acts of destruction and re-consecration in the mountains might be cause for a kind of optimism. Something was being started where nothing but evil and perhaps dormant potential were thought to exist. Yet in the diligencia there was often, at the same time, cause for pessimism. To varying degrees, indigenous gods and Andean religious organization had survived the attempted spiritual conquest; the need for idolatry investigations in general - and their destructive actions in particular - was evidence enough. The seventeenth-century diligencia was a rearguard action, an imperfect, late advance by churchmen into an "unconquered" countryside with the expectation of a retreat to 44 See the works cited in n. 4 above. I am indebted to William Taylor for encouraging me to reflect on the comparison elaborated in this paragraph. A number of the ideas I express were spurred by our correspondence on the subject. 102 NUMBER 145 PAST AND PRESENT</page><page sequence="20">RELIGIOUS COERCION IN MID-COLONIAL PERU 103 the safety and order of their urban bases. Although many of them (as experienced parish priests) knew the realities of the mid- colonial Andean world as well as any Spaniard in the viceroyalty, the visitadores frequently showed signs of feeling ill at ease outside the towns. In the diligencia they could recognize a desperation, perhaps even an admission of defeat. Of all the officials conducting idolatry investigations in the Villagomez period, visitador Juan Sarmiento de Vivero may have been the most careful to ensure that an attending notary recorded his devotion to duty and the hardships he was forced to endure.45 As a fortunate consequence, we possess descriptive accounts of a number of his diligencias, written on the spot while memories and excitement were fresh.46 Features of a few of these operations provide us with a more vivid and solid basis for the present discussion. A first example occurred in the highlands north-east of Lima, in the parish of Huamantanga, Canta, in 1664. Here, Sarmiento and a sizeable entourage resolved to visit the old town of the Sigual kin group (ayllu) and a number of other places in the surrounding area. A declaration by the regional governor (kuraka), Don Rodrigo Rupay Chapa, and a denunciation by a woman named Ana Maria, had given the visitador reason to 45 Sarmiento was fifty-six years old in 1664, the year in which the events to be described below occurred; his age was about average for an idolatry inspector active in the time of Archbishop Villag6mez. Of noble Spanish stock in Lima (according to papers presented to the Council of the Indies by his brother Jer6nimo, an ancestor had participated in the military conquest of Peru), he was educated by the Jesuits and ordained in 1637 at the age of twenty-nine. He went on to obtain a bachelor's degree in canon law from the Royal University of San Marcos in 1653. In addition to spending a number of years as chaplain to the Convent of the Incarnation in Lima, Sarmiento accepted from his prelate at least two commissions as visitador general (in 1649 to visit the diocese of Huamanga and in 1655 as inspector of the archdiocese of Lima). He was named visitador de idolatria in 1660. Sarmiento was atypical in not having served as a priest (doctrinero) in an Indian parish before his participation in the Extirpation. See Archivo General de Indias, Seville, Audiencia de Lima 303, Villag6mez to king, Lima, 28 Aug. 1658, Villag6mez to king, Lima, 8 June 1663; ibid., 304, Villag6mez to king, Lima, 5 Dec. 1664. 46 Sarmiento de Vivero was Villag6mez's busiest idolatry inspector. Of some fifty- four visitas which he conducted in the Lima region, seven (all from the colonial district of Chancay) are transcribed in Amancebados, hechiceros y rebeldes, ed. Sanchez. Many accounts of other inspectors' diligencias come only from the more detached and self-congratulatory medium of letters and informaciones de servicios written after the fact. As with so many colonial officials, visitadores often filled these accounts with boasts of their zeal and of the beneficial results of their services; see, for example, the case of Bernardo de Novoa reported in the document in Archivo General de Indias, Audiencia de Lima 333 printed in Cultura andina y represidn, ed. Duviols, pp. 423-35.</page><page sequence="21">believe that his efforts would be rewarded.47 On 1 June, Whit Sunday (the "Pascua del Espiritu Santo"), the notary recorded that Sarmiento, mounted on a mule, set out for the ancient settlement of the Sigual accompanied by an interpreter, the eccle- siastical prosecutor, two local magistrates and "many other Indians". The ancient settlement was perched high above Huamantanga, and by three in the afternoon the mules had passed as far as they might. Guided by the Indians, the party gained the summit on foot. They came upon some dilapidated homes and a small open area formed inside man-made walls of stone, from the edge of which Huamantanga could be seen far below. Inside this plazuela was an old and bountiful tree which produced coloured flowers.48 The "roots" of this tree, Sarmiento discovered from the Indians, "were those of the people". While the visitador ordered the same people to pull up the tree and destroy its roots, he and the others spent the remaining daylight hours exploring a number of covered enclosures just below the open space,49 which were found to contain numerous ancestors' remains. In due course, all were incinerated in a public auto de fe.50 Three days later, the visitador returned with a work party to erect a large wooden cross (nearly three metres in height). In standard fashion, the place was renamed as that of the Holy Spirit, because "on that day the idolatry of the pueblo had been revealed". It was not, perhaps, the appropriate moment to recall that similar idolatrous revela- tions by previous investigators had chequered this parish's recent past; the notary recorded only the pious hope that the cross would become a place "where all might worship".5' Another example from the same visita, though presenting different challenges, confirms the general pattern of the opera- tions. In the afternoon, Sarmiento set out with the pueblo's offi- cials, a Mercedarian friar and some "sixteen Indians armed with spades, sticks and three large wooden crosses".52 Before long they came upon a number of bountiful plots of land.

When they were questioned the Indians explained that this was Vicho Rinri (the notary's rendering), a huaca ancestor who was much celebrated in dances and songs.53 Three attempts to dislodge the huaca with sticks and levers - the last of which involved a new, thicker lever, an invocation of God and the addition of the exertions of the visitador - finally sent Vicho Rinri plummeting into the ravine below. Sarmiento ordered that a cross be fashioned out of the large lever, erected and shrouded in flowers. The place of Vicho Rinri was then renamed in honour of the Holy Sacrament. The diligencia ended only after the party had worshipped before the cross and the notary had made a record of the day's events.54 These are official outlines of what happened, meant to be repetitive, triumphantly repetitive, and carefully prepared in order to record zealous endeavour and to demonstrate a visitador's diligence in acting upon information that the Indians had supplied about Andean religion. The patterned coercive manoeuvres against Andean sacred places of course followed long-established Catholic practice in the struggle against "pagan" shrines. They resembled, for instance, the procedures recommended over one thousand years earlier by a man whom Archbishop Villag6mez greatly admired and often quoted in his writings, Pope Gregory 53 They reportedly sang, "Vicho Rinri papa [potato], Vicho Rinri oca [another edible South American tuber, either Oxalis 0. crenata or 0. tuberosa]": ibid., fo. 10r-V. "Rinri" means ear, and "Vicho" or "Vichu" could be what the lexicographer of Quechua, Diego Gonzalez Holguin, calls "Vicgu", meaning "tuerto" in colonial Spanish, or "twisted (either inside out or back to front)" in English. It is possible that the notary, who, along with the visitador, had the features of this anthropomorphic god's "head" explained to him, may have taken a description of a distorted feature to be the name of the deity; or the huaca may simply have had an ear that was twisted. Yet the mention of the song that included the name, along with what we can know about other huaca names in the region, suggests otherwise. A possible - if crude - translation of the huaca's name might thus be "Twisted Ear". See D. Gonzalez Holguin, Vocabulario de la lengua general de todo el Perz llamada lengua qquichua o del Inca, 3rd edn, ed. R. Matos Mendieta (Lima, 1989), pp. 318, 351.

There were also moments of unease, times when what the extirpator encountered in the Andean landscape was intellectually and practically more cumbersome than the survival of purely Indian religious forms. We may consider, for instance, what occurred just after the sacred tree above Huamantanga was uprooted and replaced with a cross. On this occasion, the denunciator, Ana Maria, interrupted the pious tenor of the moment to observe that the wall beside which they stood was very near to the recess where she and another witness had seen an accused "sorcerer", Crist6bal Chumbi Guaman (alias Llaguas), performing a suspicious act of worship. Crist6bal, who was also in the extirpator's company, protested that she lied, but Ana Maria proceeded to describe how she had seen him in that protected place, naked from the waist up, upon his knees, with his arms raised skyward, muttering to himself.56 Viewing the recess for himself, the visitador discovered an upright piece of wood nearly three metres in height, with a horizontal groove in which a second piece of wood would have rested. The Indian magistrates informed Sarmiento that these were the remains of a cross that had been erected eight years earlier by another visitador de idolatria, Don Pedro de Quijano.57 In this way, the triumphal and edifying story, the comprehensible, almost surgical act of desecration and re-consecration, are inter- rupted, not so much by persistent Andean religion, as by the traces of a more confusing kind of religious error. An extirpator's regional victory for Christianity over "idolatry" is complicated by the undecipherability of mid-colonial Indian practice. Yet if the discovery of the somewhat sorry traces of a predeces- sor's efforts at that site troubled the mind of Juan Sarmiento, we do not learn of it in the notary's record. The subsequent find of 55 See especially R. A. Markus, "Gregory the Great and a Papal Missionary Strategy", in G. J. Cuming (ed.), The Mission of the Church and the Propagation of the Faith (Studies in Church Hist., vi, Cambridge, 1970), pp. 29-38. 56 The details of the confrontation are at A.A.L., Leg. 1, Exp. 3, fo. 8r; see also ibid., fos. 6r-7r (Ana Maria's denunciation). 57 Pedro de Quijano Zevallos conducted an eventful visita in Huamantanga in 1656: see A.A.L., Leg. 2, Exp. 11. 106 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 145</page><page sequence="24">RELIGIOUS COERCION IN MID-COLONIAL PERU a quantity of human bones and skulls in the same recess, behind the remnants of the cross, concentrated his attention upon the alleged idolatry (that is, Andean religious practices) of Cristobal Chumbi Guaman58 and upon the numerous other tasks at hand. There was no return to the intriguing matter of what went on in the recess in the old town which was now flanked by two of the Extirpation's crosses. As is so often the case with the idolatry documentation, we must look to neighbouring regions for more information. Two years earlier, in somewhat similar circumstances, the dis- quiet of visitador Juan Sarmiento is less elusive. In late August 1662, Sarmiento was guided on a seven-point tour of the environs of el paraje de Canas in the parish of Sayan, Chancay, by the region's kuraka, Don Diego Pacha.59 The diligencia followed the standard pattern of demolition, cross-erection and Catholic con- secration, but at two of the huacas the visitador's party discovered the familiar traces of the previous extirpating and sanctifying efforts of a parish priest. In both cases old crosses stood a few paces away from huacas that were massive outcroppings of rock which could not be brought down or otherwise destroyed. The state of the first of these places evidently satisfied Sarmiento, for, as the notary recorded, "they did not find any signs that supersti- tions or sacrifices had been performed there in those [recent] times". 60 But the second site was more disturbing to the visitador's conscience. His concern over the fate of the religious ground which had been distinguished by a predecessor's cross was nat- ural; after all, previous extirpating actions were among the few yardsticks he had to measure the effect of the actions he solemnly continued. A previous testimony taken in the village had revealed the belief that the huaca at this place had been "consuming" (or stealing the health of) the children of the kuraka, Don Diego 58 A.A.L., Leg. 1, Exp. 3, fo. 8r-. This case is made even more interesting by the fact that both Ana Maria and Crist6bal escaped from Huamantanga and sought to influence the proceedings by appealing to Archbishop Villag6mez in Lima. We learn that pre-existing enmity had motivated Ana Maria's denunciation to the visitador, thus increasing the possibility that Crist6bal had been wrongfully accused. See A.A.L., Leg. 1, Exp. 1, 1664. 59 A.A.L., Leg. 5, Exp. 5. The main diligencias were conducted on 25 and 30 August.

Moreover, the great white rock with its accompanying cross stood in the midst of an ancient settlement (pueblo viejo) in which they also found, in the notary's words, a "large cave", the ceiling of which featured "a great number of different figures of demons in the form of animals with horns, painted in black". Although Sarmiento seemed to accept that this same kuraka who now guided him had reformed his thinking with respect to the devouring huaca, the investigator clearly wondered about what had been the effect on the minds of other Indians of the cross that stood at that place. Standing in the pueblo viejo staring at the central Christian symbol in the shadow of the immovable rock whose Andean significance and supposed divine outrage (at the kuraka's ritual negligence) were only dimly perceived, sur- rounded by other huacas and painted figures that had been called demons, might possibly have led Sarmiento to a sobering contem- plation of the efficacy both of the policy of repeated visitas de idolatria62 and, more immediately, of his own diligencias among the Indians. The notary registered that the visitador became pre- occupied with "a quantity of small stones which appeared to have been placed by hand" at a point on the rock-face which proved impossible to reach by climbing.63 Because a cross had already been erected, Sarmiento could only ease his apparent dissatisfac- tion with what was being achieved by naming the place after "the glorious St John the Baptist".64 The actions of the extirpators in these instances from Canta and Chancay in the early 1660s suggest a number of questions. Although most of them defy certain answers, taken together they begin to penetrate to the heart of what was occurring in the mid- colonial archdiocese of Lima. We can consider the ayllu's ancient 61 Ibid., fo. 1. 62 Following Arriaga's recommendations, Villag6mez argues that the visitas in the Indian parishes, including whatever punishments and destruction of Andean sacra proved necessary, should be repeated: Villag6mez, Carta pastoral de exortaci6n e instrucci6n, ed. Urteaga, esp. pp. 25-33, 80-5, 105-26. 63 It was common for small, smooth stones to be included in offerings to mountain huacas: see, for example, A.A.L., Leg. 4, Exp. 8, Carhuamayo, Junin, Felipe Nuna Vilca (at fo. 2r), transcribed in K. R.

What did this place, and others like it, mean to Indians in the mid-colonial era? Before this visita occurred, what had been the attitude of the Mercedarian friars- who were the people's priests, doctrineros and confessors - towards continued devotion and commitment to the place? What were the effects of the visita's diligencias that physically uprooted the ancient flowering tree, the roots of which were said to be "those of the people", the incineration of the ancestors' bones, and innumerable acts like these throughout the archdiocese? And what of the successive efforts by the visitadores to erase and supplant the traditional significance of Andean sacred places through the erection of crosses and propitious christenings? The huge stone presence, the ancestor Vicho Rinri, whose sanctuary does not appear to have been assaulted until Sarmiento's visit, offers another challenge for our analysis. Even the admit- tedly slim evidence that we have in his particular case indicates that Vicho Rinri, like so many other huacas in the Andes, was a religious survivor, a manifestation of the fact that Catholic dom- ination in the community and region did not negate Andean religious affiliations. In 1664 the reference to dancing and singing in his name suggests that his benevolence, and probably even his mythical past, were regularly commemorated. Like others of his ilk from neighbouring regions where different and more abundant details survive in the documentary evidence, we can imagine that Vicho Rinri was given offerings and consulted by a faithful minis- ter, and that he was attended by others who depended on his protection and favour. But we must further explore the intricacies of the changing religious situation of which this Andean ancestor-being had increasingly become a part. Vicho Rinri, like so many other sur- viving huacas, would have transformed himself in colonial times, mirroring the needs of his people. He acquired an expanded range of functions, a meaning and a relationship with people who increasingly participated in both Christian and Andean religious frameworks. Apullana Guara and Mama Guanca, two similar beings from Churin, were approached by their people not only to bring agricultural and pastoral abundance, but also to prevent the abuses of a parish priest and corregidor.65 Guaman Cama, a 65 A.A.L., Leg. 3, Exp. 11, 1725, fo. 6r. 109</page><page sequence="27">principal huaca of Acas in mid-seventeenth-century Cajatambo, was asked by his people (among many other entreaties) for per- mission to attend the Catholic festival of the village patron, St Peter.66 Although some Andean religious forms would prove less adaptable to the exigencies of the seventeenth century, Vicho Rinri from Canta was a familiar force in the regional colonial world, both a traditional guardian of agricultural prosperity and a pragmatic, evolving protector. The image of a huaca retaining importance through transformation, demonstrating the capacity to absorb innovation and expand a spiritual repertoire, can be viewed as a regional expression of what was occurring in the mid-colonial Andean religious system as a whole. How did the methods of the Extirpation fare against so variable and elastic a rival? Vicho Rinri's fall into the ravine, like the destruction of other gods, was meant by the extirpators to be a finalizing event, a resolution. But how would the act of destruc- tion have been interpreted by the Indians who had assisted the deed, or those who heard of it later? And would recollection of the event have affected their conception of the destroying lever-cum-cross that was meant to be the huaca's symbolic substitute? These central questions persist, and are not merely rhetorical. While we can readily appreciate what was meant to be achieved by the diligencia operations, there are considerable indications that these acts of destruction and re-consecration did not inspire as much real confidence in extirpating circles as was often claimed for official and justificatory purposes. At times, once the thin crust of triumphalism is broken through, there is a pervasive sense of futility before an insurmountable problem. There is a feeling of resignation, even of desperation. When little else could be done to advance the faith, the ceremony of fashioning and raising the supreme Christian symbol was made to suffice. Perhaps the ceremonial reconsecrations by the extirptors of Andean sacred sites were even some extirpators' expressions of ultimate failure - acts of giving in, but with some dignity.67 For their tasks were, more often than not, physically - if not 6 On what ensued with the image, see Mills, Evil Lost to View?, pp. 61-83. 671 am indebted to Peter Brown for sharing with me his knowledge of similar extirpation methods in late antique and early Christian Europe and stimulating me to explore this possibility further. 110 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 145</page><page sequence="28">RELIGIOUS COERCION IN MID-COLONIAL PERU religiously - impossible. Extirpators frequently lamented the fact that many huacas were "born of the hills themselves";68 others, although detached from the mountainsides, were so large or impossibly placed that they also proved indestructible.69 Moreover, although in theory most diligencias set out against specific deities and shrines, in practice the actions could take on a weary and wanton character (like an early entrada, as noted above), eager to crush whatever they could find. These ecclesiast- ical judges felt a need to justify the considerable effort involved in mounting the visitas by achieving some - and sometimes any - material result. For example, in the parish of Omas, Yauyos, in 1660, no person seemed willing to lead the visitador to the "stone . . . in the form of a person" in the Yanapati ravine, not even knowledgeable Pedro Chumbi who had confessed its exist- ence; yet the investigation contented itself by ravaging an ancient burial site that had been found along the way.70 As has been suggested from evidence even beyond the limits of the Lima region, Indians became practised at sating the extirpators' almost indiscriminate appetite for "idols" while at the same time guard- ing what was most important.71 The apparent physical results of those efforts that found their particular targets are equally contentious. The meaning and pres- ence of a huaca which was taken away, smashed into pieces, burnt in a plaza or heaved into a ravine were not necessarily forgotten. In fact, the actions of contemporary churchmen betrayed their growing anxiety over Andean religious allegiances which seemed impossible to extinguish. It became established procedure to dis- pose secretly of all pieces, dust and ashes of the huacas and malquis which had been demolished, for fear of the Indians' continued worship of "relics". As Andres Guaman Pilpi of San Pedro de Acas, Cajatambo, explained to Bernardo de Novoa in 1657, the survival of the local huaca Marcayan could be accounted for, 68 See A.A.L., Leg. 7, Exp. 1, Lunahuana, Cafiete, fo. 4'. 69 See, for instance, Sarmiento's recorded confrontation with a massive stone outside Andacoto in Canta: A.A.L., Leg. 4, Exp. 22, Atavillos, Canta, 1659, fos. 1'-2'. 70 A.A.L., Leg. 2, Exp. 18, San Pedro de Pilas, Yauyos, fos. 24r-26r. 71 See A.

We cannot say with certainty what roles were assumed by the seemingly innumerable crosses that were meant to extinguish old Andean loyalties and point the spiritual way forward. But we can, of course, readily state what a few of those roles were supposed to be. For the most Hispanicized and Christian members of Indian society the crosses were to be a gift of encouragement; here was God's most powerful sign, his holy brand upon another part of his world.73 Even more than that, the crosses commemorated the great acts of destruction and resanctification. The symbols were to provide the extirpators with an assurance of permanent effect that they desperately needed, just as they were to provide the Indians with strong memories of their huacas' humiliation and defeat. The words of Sarmiento's notary confirm that the renaming of the places where crosses were erected was undertaken to turn the localities into perpetual reminders of the day when idolatry had been banished and Christianity had triumphed. The actions in the mountains and ancient settlements effectively made it seem possible for the extirpators, in Anthony Pagden's phrase, "to transform the un-possessable".74 But, of course, for most indigenous people it was hardly so simple. The triumphal outline, the show of assured mastery, is a screen obscuring a more ambiguous reality. Many early mission- aries seem to have recognized the fluidity of Indian religious constructs; this reality inspired caution in some, while others 72 For accounts of careful Jesuit actions in Cajatambo and Huamanga, see Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu, Rome, Carta anua de 1664, 1665 y 1666, Peru 16, T.

According to Bernal Diaz del Castillo, Fray Bartolome de Olmedo, who accompanied Hernan Cortes in the early days of the Spanish presence in Mexico, was inclined to be more cautious than the conqueror about the erection of crosses as reminders of the Spaniards' early preaching and their efforts to extirpate Indian cults. "In my opinion", Olmedo is said to have told Cortes, "it is too early to leave a cross in these people's possession ... What you have told them is enough until they are better acquainted with our holy religion".75 Ram6n Gutierrez's interpretation of the "confabulation" of Christian crosses with indigenous prayer- sticks in the early contacts between Spaniards and Pueblos in New Mexico would seem to underline Olmedo's point.76 According to Gutierrez, some Franciscans in New Mexico pro- ceeded as many of their earlier brethren had done in New Spain, salvaging aspects of the Indian religiosity which were already present and employing these supposed parallels for Christian ends. Indigenous peoples would come to recognize "the power of the men who brandished crosses" and from that point it would take little effort "to convince them to worship the cross".77 Perhaps. But it is dangerous to look for, and to think in terms of, some of the very parallels between European and Indian religions that colonial Spanish churchmen sought. Moreover, quite what the "worship" of the symbol meant to a seventeenth- century Puebloan or, to return to present concern, an Andean religious imagination in the mid-colonial years, remains open to question. 75 Bernal Diaz del Castillo, The Conquest of New Spain, trans.

For there were many "degrees" of what has commonly been called the process of Christianization in the mid-colonial Andean world. Among the many possible variables, these degrees were affected by the nature of previous evangelization, exposure to persuasive anti-idolatry preaching and the rival messages of any Andean dogmatizers who might exist. As a result, the roles of Christian symbols and concepts depended on the decisions - and sometimes even the opportunistic whims - of a varied indigenous society.78 In interpreting the religious allegiances of the Andeans we must be careful not to be misguided by the religious assumptions of contemporary Spanish churchmen. For it was in terms of a clear- cut Augustinian opposition between Christians and idolaters, between the camps of light and darkness, between those who had been won over by the gospel and those who wickedly resisted it, that many mid-colonial missionaries and extirpators preferred to interpret the religious reality in Indian areas. Conceiving of a neat division between those who chose God and good and those who chose idolatry and evil had its explanatory advantages. It provided a time-honoured and convenient dualism with which to explain the constitution of Andean parishes where religious recal- citrance seemed a growing problem despite the people's long- standing relationship with Catholicism.79 But what basis is there to think of mid-colonial Andean society in terms of a strict polarity of religious feeling, a factionalism along religious lines?80 It is important to view the time of a visita's presence in an Indian parish as an abnormal time of fear and tension, a time of unreality when an artificial dualism might be 78 Similar "degrees" of religious change in colonial Mexico are discussed by Gruzinski, Conquest of Mexico, esp. ch. 4 passim and pp. 178-80. 79 On the diabolic aspect of contemporary European perceptions, see the brilliant (and remarkably concise) remarks by J. H.

As historians of the Inquisition and of ecclesiastical law will not be surprised to discover, idolatry denunciations in the Andean communities multiplied when they were encouraged, and when the climate of opinion was such that something might easily be gained through them.81 But religious boundary lines and the eccentricities of local belief structures which were being trans- formed during the colonial years were not usually policed so tirelessly. When the visita moved on - depending, of course, on such crucial variables as the views of a parish priest and the degree of Andean religious survival - there could be a return to what might tentatively be called normal times. Individual priests or friars, perhaps in the interests of village tranquillity or because of a tolerance bred by experience, might overlook certain kinds of Indian error. Indians, free from the pressure to conform absolutely, might actively seek the benefits and solace offered by a growing pool of spiritual opportunities. Andean religious life, the interaction between indigenous and Spanish religious concep- tions and practices, could be less constrained and more harmoni- ous than is often implied. This is not to suggest that contestation between Spanish Catholic and Andean leaders over religious (and secular) power in the parishes was eliminated or lacked significance. In many communities there were clearly Indians who, through their testimonies, demonstrated that they were allies of the priests, and that as committed Christians they were opponents of Andean religion. And there were ardent practitioners of Andean religion who articulately countered the religious assimilations they could discern and who actively disputed the growing place for ele- ments of Christianity in the Indian world. In Acas, Cajatambo, dogmatizers warned that if the huacas and malquis were not nourished by offerings the people would "lose their plots of land . . . and their irrigation canals and springs would dry up" and they would be condemned "to walk poor and desolate and . . . all waste away".82 Such stark warnings were not made without reason, for few people faced Christianity with an 81 Idolatry accusations often became channels for ill will, self-interest and local political disputes.

Acosta Rodriguez on an earlier period in the Extirpation's history, especially "Doctrineros y la extirpaci6n". 82 Francisco Poma y Altas and Juan Raura, in Cultura andina y represi6n, ed.

Many, in effect, contravened the precise dictates of both their parish priests and their Andean dogmatizers, proving themselves more discerning and even experimental in their religious decisions. The possible examples are numerous, ranging from elaborate instances such as those noted above when huacas and saints were absorbed into each other's observances, to more mundane ones. In 1661, for instance, Magdalena Callao (alias Condoriana), a famous healer from Lunahuana, Cainete, con- sulted an unnamed outcropping of rock and employed largely Andean substances and massaging methods in the performance of her art; yet, by her own admission, she rubbed her patient "in the name of Our Father and Our Lady".83 It is this middle ground which is frequently labelled "syncret- ism". Yet the term is imprecise; its multiple associations with parallel religious systems, clean conceptual substitutions, cloaks and guises, tops and bottoms, and so on, hinder our understanding far more than they help it. While the entrance or incorporation of elements of Christianity into Andean religious thinking and practice are undeniable and are increasingly apparent in a number of spheres, these aspects of the Europeans' faith became elements in the Andean religious framework by a fluctuating agenda, vary- ing from place to place, individual to individual, and usually without clearly eclipsing the existing religious connections. The crosses erected by the visitadores, near or on top of the regional huacas, take their place amidst these complicated realities in the mid-colonial Andean religious world. Once they had been stuck in the soil at the base of a cliff or propped up in a pile of stones in a pueblo viejo, and once the visita had moved on, the holy crosses became ambiguous monuments, supremely Christian symbols in deeply Andean contexts.84 Their 83 The words came in response to the visitador Sarmiento de Vivero's query: "What words had she said when she was rubbing .. .?"

More probably, however, it had a function and significance which remain unknown to us. In that case, ill will and procedural complications obscure any serious clues as to what the place with the cross had come to mean and what rites might have been observed there, if not by the accused, Cristobal Chumbi Guaman, then perhaps by others. Comparable information from neighbouring regions provides some suggestive complements, even if the interpretative task remains a difficult one. Many people who came before the visitadores de idolatria were conspicuously reticent about the fate of the huacas and of the important places that had come to the extirpators' attention and been "Christianized" by a cross and perhaps a name. Examples abound of mid-colonial Indian witnesses who, having experienced previous idolatry investigations, had learned how to face an extirpator or a zealous priest. Veterans of the extirpation process grew adept at strategic silence, at concealing what would surely draw rebuke and punishment, and protecting what mattered. The meaning of the places would remain a mystery, were it not for the fact that the people's muteness and obfuscation in the face of persistent interrogation are not always as unhelpful as they might seem. Juan Paria Vilca of Lanca in the parish of el Chorrillo, Huarochiri, for instance, was insistently questioned by Sarmiento in 1659 about a place in the Lanca ravine called Acora (or Acoia) where an earlier visitador, Dr Ramirez,86 had erected a cross. When Sarmiento asked, "Had the ancients worshipped (mochado) at it?", Juan answered obliquely that the Indians of el Chorrillo were angered with those of his village because the latter "spoke so freely and would confess to the Jesuits who then destroyed all the errors".87 The man, not wishing to substantiate his neigh- bours' charges, remained evasive or completely silent.

Although she denied it, the prosecutor, Don Diego Bartolome, claimed that she "cried in voices in the custom of the elders and ancients", and that others, too, "cried out the ancient names on that hill". Maria said that she did not know if the hill had ever been a mochadero (a place for Andean offerings and worship). But she was conspicuously quick to deny another alarming allegation which came up against her, namely that she and others prayed with rosaries and engaged in self-flagellation (disciplinas) on the hill. In her own defence, she claimed that she performed her acts of Christian penance only in her home or in the church.88 Maria Casa Suyo of Quinti was similarly cryptic concerning her many visits to the place called Guaychipan where there was a huaca named Raypa Nusca. Although two Jesuits, Padres Salazar and Clavero, had erected crosses and consecrated the place with holy water, Maria disingenuously claimed not to know why the missionaries would have gone to that effort.89 And when in 1696 Juan Saavedra y Osorio questioned the well-known ritual specialist Juan Baptista about a huaca marked by a cross on the road near the village of Marco in Canta, the notary recorded only "that he answered in the negative as he had done for the preceding question".90 The most intriguing characteristics which El Inca Garcilaso de la Vega attributed to huacas, as he struggled to define them for his readers and posterity, were their astonishing variety and ver- satility. The most illuminating single source for colonial Andean religion, the "Huarochiri Manuscript", concurs, even telling how the "visible forms" of some huacas might be rediscovered in colonial times.91 Some of the crosses erected on or in place of huacas by the Extirpation's diligencias may have gradually become - if not huacas themselves - at least elements integrated into 88 See A.A.L., Leg. 2, Exp. 22, one small loose folio, unnumbered, and fo. 2r. 89 A.A.L., legajo and expediente unnumbered, San Lorenzo de Quinti, Huarochiri, 1660, fo. 9v.

The reluctance of Andeans to tell of the histories and redefined significance of the Christianized shrines, springs and caves is eminently understandable. These things, like other indications of Andean religious change, were rewarded only with lashings, ban- ishments and shame. The changes in the Indian religious world that we are documenting represent the beginnings of what we might call an Andean Christianity; but this complex entity was, by any definition, at variance with the demands of the purveyors of the official faith during the years of extirpation. The Extirpation sought to enforce a rupture with the past in the Indian communities, not only the prehispanic past but also the past since the Spanish conquest, because years of religious mixture, contestation and reformulation had generated a host of new meanings in the Andean world. When Domingo Garcia of Arahuay in Canta was imprisoned by an extirpator in the early 1740s, one of the charges against him was that he planned to smear llama's blood on the foundations and adobe walls of a new local church "to make it strong". The provisor in Lima asked him how a "Christian" could do such a thing; Domingo answered that it was standard procedure in constructing a church. He even noted that his forefathers had done the same when building the church at Pampacocha. Under pressure from his interrogator, Domingo eventually attempted to back down a little, claiming that this practice was only "a tradition he had acquired from his ancestors". Anyway, he assured his judge, when he had purchased a second llama for the purpose, he had been careful to offer its sacrificial blood only to the church floor.92 Holy crosses, patron saints, invocations, coexistent terminology and concepts, Christian penance and rites associated with feast- days in both Andean and Catholic calendars - all these were becoming part of the religious activities and observances that continued at Andean religious places. This much Indian witnesses could only partially conceal, but this much most mid-colonial extirpators proved unable to face. The physical excursions into the Andean hinterlands, and the destruction and strategic place- ment of crosses which were the material results, were meant to inspire in the Indians a final acceptance of prescribed Catholic 92 A.A.L., Leg. 3, Exp. 17, 1741-2, fos. 2r-v, 6v, 7r. 119</page><page sequence="37">devotions and a dread at the thought of the diabolically motivated errors of the past. The fact that, generally speaking, they did not - not even for Indian people who professed to be cristianos is a reflection of the failure of the process of the Extirpation to be what its greatest proponent Pedro de Villag6mez claimed it was: the ultimate antidote to suspect Andean religiosity. The entry of Andean peoples into a deepening relationship with Catholicism began with the baptisms and teachings of the first missionaries in the sixteenth century. It continued in the day-to-day relations between priests and their Andean parish- ioners,93 relations that were of little or no interest to the idolatry inspectors of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The progress of this relationship was slower in the Andes than, for example, in parts of central Mexico. The number of friars in New Spain was greater from the beginning, and - as many scholars have shown - many of their attitudes towards the evangelization of Indians had been formed in earlier, more optim- istic times.94 Moreover, in central Mexico such difficulties as the decades of civil war and immense geographical constraints, factors which were immediately present in the Andes, raised fewer obs- tacles to missionary endeavour. Finally, the Christianization of the Andeans was clearly not limited solely by self-imposed restraints, nor by the invincibility of Indian religious tradition, nor by a presumed recalcitrance. Andeans were active agents in the challenges that beset their world, but the particular face of the Christianity which was epitomized by the idolatry visitas and their diligencias contributed significantly to the religious out- comes. Extirpation campaigns bred a sort of natural resistance which allowed for myriad forms of religious intermixture;95 93 For a beginning, though with later emphases, see C. Hunefeldt, "Comunidad, curas y comuneros hacia fines del peri6do colonial: ovejas y pastores indomados en el Peru", Hisla, no. 2 (1983), pp. 3-31; D. Cahill, "Curas and Social Conflict in the Doctrinas of Cuzco, 1780-1814", Jl Latin Amer. Studies, xvi (1984), pp. 241-76. For a particularly rich treatment of these relations in late colonial Mexico, see Taylor, Magistrates of the Sacred. 94 See especially Ricard, Spiritual Conquest of Mexico; Phelan, Millennial Kingdom of the Franciscans in the New World; E. Sylvest, Motifs of Franciscan Mission Theory in Sixteenth-Century New Spain (Washington, D.C., 1975); L. G6mez Canedo, Evangelizacion y conquista: experiencia franciscana en Hispanoamerica (Mexico City, 1977). 95 For S. J. Stern's reflections on resistance, see his essay, "New Approaches to the Study of Peasant Rebellion and Consciousness: Implications of the Andean Experience", in Stern (ed.), Resistance, Rebellion and Consciousness, pp. 3-25.

The Extirpation's forms of coercion may also have fostered a need to withdraw and a deep distrust and hatred which would brew until an outlet was found in later rebellions.96 And it is not so difficult to know how to interpret an indigenous response to religious investigation which is more common in the evidence from the eighteenth century, that of guarded silence. We know that in at least one region elders had learned a valuable lesson by 1725:97 they instructed people to keep their true beliefs to themselves. Princeton University Kenneth Mills (n. 95 cont.) J. Lockhart has also recommended a careful employment of categories like "resist- ance" and "conversion" in the case of the post-conquest central Mexico: Lockhart, Nahuas after the Conquest, p. 203. Many possible forms of insubordination are explored in a broad comparative context by J. C. Scott, Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts (New Haven, 1990). 96 Amid a growing literature, see Stern, "New Approaches to the Study of Peasant Rebellion and Consciousness"; J. Szemiiiski, "Why Kill a Spaniard? New Perspectives on the Andean Insurrectionary Ideology in the 18th Century", in Stern (ed.), Resistance, Rebellion and Consciousness, pp. 166-91.
