<plain_text><page sequence="1">235 Denomination and iconography: the choice of subject matter in the biblical painting of the Rembrandt circle* Volker Manuth In the past, art historians have shown relatively little interest in the connection between the personal religious beliefs of seventeenth-century Dutch artists and their representations of sacred subjects. This has recently be- gun to change, partially as a result of the re-evaluation of the history painting of the Golden Age, which began in i980-8i with the Gods, saints and heroes exhibition'- a show that successfully disengaged this art from the ongoing debates about realism in genre painting. It was only with the greatest hesitation that scholars began to incorporate the knowledge offered by affiliated historical disciplines into their examinations of the seventeenth- century religious painting of the northern Netherlands: this material, however, has now allowed them to arrive at a more differentiated picture of the relationship of Protestantism to the fine arts. Research into various as- pects of Dutch culture has corrected a dominant, and often simplified, vision of Calvinist society. Above all, it has become apparent that the communal and religious structures of the northern provinces-born of the Dutch Revolt against Catholic Spain and generally be- lieved to be homogeneously Calvinist-were far more complex and varied than previously assumed. Art-histo- rical literature has only now begun to examine questions whose answers Seymour Slive regarded in 1956 as ne- cessary to a fuller understanding of the links between Dutch art and religion. Slive wrote: "How much do we really know about Protestantism in The Netherlands during the seventeenth century? What percentage of the population of the Northern Provinces remained Catho- lic and for how long? How fundamental was the effect of conversion upon the work of former Catholic painters? What was the relative strength of various Protestant sects, and what was the nature of, and how effective was their control of the artist?"2 The so-called Alteration-the assumption of power by the Calvinist faction in Amsterdam in I578-did not lead to a radical and abrupt change in the denominatio- nal and political make-up of the city. It was only much later, namely on i8 April 1580, that Catholic services and "preaching, marrying, baptizing and other practices in the Roman manner" were banned.3 Many ruling fa- milies were related by marriage, and such ties were con- sidered more important than differences in faith. Fur- thermore, varying opinions on religious questions led to continual conflicts between the actual representatives of the church and the Amsterdam regents. This tension is certainly one of the causes for the failure of the Dutch Reformed Church to achieve the status of an official state-sanctioned religion. Nonetheless, it was a powerful * The following article is an expanded version of a lecture given at the International Rembrandt Symposium, held on i6-I7 January I992 at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. My earliest ideas on the subject were presented on 4 December i990 at the symposium "Het Oude Testa- ment in de Gouden Eeuw," organized by Christian Tumpel in Nijme- gen, under the title "Zur Ikonographie alttestamentlicher Historien im Amsterdamer Rembrandtkreis-Auftraggeber, Besitzer und Kunstler" and were based on my dissertation, Ikonographische Studien zu den Historien des Alten Testaments bei Rembrandt und seinerfruhen Amsterdamer Schule.

It soon became extremely difficult for members of other denominations to attain public office, thus making it nearly impossible for them to have any direct political influence. After the events of the Alteration, a religious dissi- dent's political beliefs to a large extent determined his treatment by the authorities. It was primarily the Catho- lic members of the Amsterdam city council sympathetic to Spain who were the targets of repression, and some of them were expelled as early as 1578. In the wake of fear caused by the Spanish reconquest of Antwerp, they were followed by a second group in 1585. Among the latter was Pieter Segersz (1548-1603?), the father of Rembrandt's teacher Pieter Lastman.4 Until the Altera- tion he had been a city messenger; that same year he was removed from his post and his name appears on the list of Catholics exiled in I585.5 He was, however, able to return to Amsterdam a short time later. Tolerance towards dissenters also depended on the ability of the liberal regents to assert themselves in the face of the church administration. The orthodox cler- gy's complaints about members of other denominations, and its subsequent demands that measures be taken against them, often went unheeded. Particularly in the first period without a stadtholder (i650-72), when the controversy over the primacy of religious or civil law was at its height, the Amsterdam city fathers sought to strengthen their position against the clerics' continual attempts at interference. The friction between the two groups became apparent in the debate as to whether the dome of the enormous new town hall could be higher than the projected tower of the Nieuwe Kerk (the old tower had been damaged in a fire in i645). The regents' position in this conflict was given visual form in the iconographic program of the Amsterdam Town Hall, in which Moses (the giver of the law) is opposed to Aaron (a high priest). The magistrates' chamber, for example, is decorated with a representa- tion of Moses bringing the Israelites the tables of the law (Exodus 34:29-32). Ferdinand Bol's large painting shows Moses returning from Mount Sinai, striding to- ward his people as they pray at the foot of the moun- tain.6 Albert Blankert has correctly indicated the politi- cal and theological implications of this choice by pointing to the ongoing struggle between the theocratic and orthodox Calvinists and the moderate Remon- strants during this period.7 The latter sought the subor- dination of the church to the state, justifying this posi- tion by reference to the hierarchy of the Old Testament: Moses had not only designated Aaron as the high priest, but was given the role of leader of the Jewish people. This divisiveness was one of the reasons that the li- beral regents were able to treat groups outside the domi- nant church (e.g. Catholics, Lutherans, Mennonites, Jews) with relative leniency-all the more important considering the role members of these denominations played in the economic development of the city. Pieter van Thiel recently noted that one result of this tolerance was that "religious life in the seventeenth century was a rich and many-colored tapestry, which is not to say that all were active participants."8 The varied religious backgrounds of Rembrandt's Amsterdam clients in the i63os and 40s illustrate this point well. The artist por- trayed moderate Calvinists such as the Remonstrant mi- nister Uyttenbogaert, and Mennonites like the parish teacher Cornelis Claesz. Anslo and his wife Aeltje Ger- ritszdr. Schouten, Maarten Looten and Catrina Hoogh- saet. He also painted such Catholics as the shipbuilder Jan Rijksen and his wife Griet Jans, and members of the Amsterdam Jewish community such as Ephraim Bueno 4 The extensive archive materials on the genealogy of Rembrandt's teacher Pieter Lastman have recently been published, see S.

Is the adoption of a certain biblical theme basis enough for an interpretation of the work as advocating a specific religious ideology? It is comparatively easy to answer these questions in the case of non-biblical, but none- theless religious, paintings whose content relates direct- ly to Roman Catholic practices. Abraham Bloemaert's Triumph of the Eucharist with thefour church fathers, for example, was most certainly not painted for a Protestant patron.'0 The clandestine Catholic churches-called "papist meeting-places" by the Reformed Church councils of the seventeenth century-needed altar- pieces. I I Orders for such works were placed with both Catholic and Protestant painters, however, as Jan van Bijlert's Holy Trinity with St Willibrord and St Boniface demonstrates. The work was formerly in the Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk in Huissen (Gelderland) and was probably commissioned by a Catholic brotherhood (fig. I).I 2 In this context it is also necessary to mention Jacob Jordaens-one of the most popular painters in the northern Netherlands at this period. This Antwerp painter was to contribute to the decoration of the Am- sterdam Town Hall and was also among the Flemish artists commissioned by Amalia van Solms, widow of Stadtholder Frederik Hendrik, to work on the Oranje- zaal in Huis ten Bosch. Jordaens was of Catholic family but had converted to Protestantism at an unknown date. In the i65os he was accused of possessing heretical lite- rature and was fined by the Catholic city government. ' 3 By this time his sympathies for the Reformation were no longer a secret; nonetheless, he still received commis- sions from Catholic institutions, even those situated outside the southern Netherlands. Between i655 and i66o, for example, he painted a large Carrying of the Cross for the clandestine church "De Krijtberg" (Chalk Hill) in Amsterdam, founded for the Jesuits in i654 by Petrus Laurentius. ' 4 Recent research has shown that Samuel van Hoog- straeten's statements regarding the lack of commissions for Catholic churches in the northern provinces in the seventeenth century need to be qualified. I5 Many art- ists, both prominent and less well-known, were asked to complete work for Catholic patrons: Wouter Pietersz. Crabeth, Abraham and Hendrick Bloemaert, Pieter de Grebber, Gerard van Honthorst, Jan van Bijlert and Nicolaes Roosendael, to name only a few. '6 There were a number of instances in which Catholic churches or- dered altarpieces in series, rotating the paintings in the course of the ecclesiastical year.'7 Only in exceptional cases, however, do the archives allow for an exact recon- struction of the circumstances surrounding these com- missions.'8 Provenances can seldom be traced back as far as the seventeenth century, and inventories or illus- trations of church interiors which would help identify certain works are generally non-existent before the eighteenth or nineteenth century. '9 The difficult task of designating a work as an altarpiece once it has been removed from its original context is compounded when the representation does not differ iconographically from the biblical text-placing it in a broad tradition which spans the different denominations. Although the major- ity of such works were vertical formats (often I.5 to 2 meters wide and between 2 and 3 meters high), size alone is not always proof of a painting's original func- tion.20 Paintings with biblical themes commissioned for pri- vate use were nearly ubiquitous among the members of all denominations. Here we can be certain that Catholic artists worked for Protestant patrons and vice versa. Un- fortunately, too little is known about these unofficial commissions for biblical history paintings. Although it is sometimes possible to follow the provenance of such a work back to a private collection of the seventeenth cen- tury, there is no guarantee that that particular owner was also the original client.2' Taking into account the enor- mous output of Dutch painters,22 and the highly devel- oped art market in Amsterdam, the buying and selling of biblical paintings must have been widespread.23 There is no convincing evidence that any one denomination privileged certain themes or iconography.24 Works that closely follow the biblical text, without dogmatic or ico- nographical peculiarities, can be connected only with difficulty, if at all, to specific doctrines. The motivation behind either the original commission or a painting's later purchase, in so far as it can be reconstructed, ap- pears to have nothing to do with the denomination of the artist.

Dubiez, "Drie beeldende kunstenaars en drie rabbijnen te Amsterdam in de zeventiende eeuw," Kroniek van het Rembrandthuis 92 (1992), nr. 2, pp. 23-32. The mistaken belief that Govert Flinck's Portrait of a 44-year-old man (The Hague, Maurits- huis, inv. nr. 866) is also of Menasseh ben Israel has persisted to this day: see most recently H. T. Carstensen, Empirie als Bildsprache: iberlegungen zumjidischen Einfluss auf Rembrandts Kunst, Hamburg 1993, pp. 41-42. The artist clearly states the sitter's age ("AE 44"); in i637 (the date of the painting), however, Menasseh ben Israel (i604- 57) was only 33 years old. On this issue see A. Behr, "The iconography of Menasseh ben Israel," The Jewish Historical Society of England Transactions, Sessions I955-59 I19, pp. i9i-98, esp. pp. 192-95, and W.

Swillens, "Roomsch-Katholieke kunstenaars in de I7de eeuw," Katholiek Cultureel Tydschrift I(1946), pp. 416-i9. The list has recently been supplemented on the basis of I. van Thiel's research in van Thiel, op. cit. (note 8), p. 55, note 73. 17 Cf. X. van Eck, "Wouter Pietersz. Crabeth i i en de parochie St. Johannes de Doper in Gouda," Oud Holland ioi (1987), pp. 35-49. Van Eck has conclusively shown that the Catholic cleric Petrus Pur- merent ordered five paintings for his church in Gouda from Crabeth: an Assumption of the Virgin, an Adoration of the Magi, an Entombment, a Doubting Thomas and a scene of St Bernard converting William of Aquitaine, see van Eck, "From doubt to conviction," cit. (note 14), pp. 220-22. Besides the many paintings that in turn decorated the altars during the course of the ecclesiastical year, commissions were given for series of paintings to cover the church walls, for example the five scenes from the Passion completed in i664 for the church of the Augustines "de Ster" (The Star); see Schillemans, "Schilderijen," cit. (note I5), p. 42. i8 Schillemans, "Schilderijen," cit. (note I5), p. 43. I9 Ibid. 20 Ibid., p. 42. There are examples of much smaller altarpieces also commissioned by the Catholic churches. One of these is the Cruci- fixion by the practically unknown artist "H.C.been" that has been in the collection of the Rijksmuseum Het Catharijneconvent in Utrecht since I977 (inv. nr. BMH S. 86o8i.). The work was executed around I645 and measures 97 x 84 cm; it probably belonged originally to the chapel "Het Hofje der Zeven Keurvorsten" (Court of the Seven Elec- tors) in Amsterdam, see R. Schillemans, exhib. cat. Bibelschilderkunst rond Rembrandt, Utrecht (Rijksmuseum Het Catharijneconvent) I989, pp. 27-30 (ill.) 2I As J.

The following example will serve to demonstrate this point. In July i682, eight years before his death, Diego Duarte, a Jewish jewelry and art dealer from Antwerp, made an inventory of his large art collection.26 Duarte noted the artist, subject matter and price of approximately 200 high-quality works of Ita- lian, Flemish and Dutch painting. Since Duarte certain- ly practiced his own religion in secret, and since he was an art dealer, the actual objects he owned do not tell us much about preferences in religious themes. Much more indicative is the fate of a number of these works after Duarte's death.27 His principal heir was a relative, Manuel Levy Duarte, who lived in Amsterdam and be- longed to the board of governors of the Portuguese Sy- nagogue. He resold the works he had inherited and kept an exact record of his transactions. In this context, one sale in particular stands out: on 2 November i692, Jacques Vaz Faro (alias Mosseh Vaz Faro), the leader of the Sephardic community in Amsterdam, bought ii works from Manuel Levy, who sold them at the price listed in Diego Duarte's inventory of I 682, i.e. without a surcharge. They included a Peasant kermis by Teniers; a Pan by P. Brill; a Neptune with nymphs by an anonymous artist; the Portrait of a praying man by J. Gossaert; two oil sketches by Rubens; two portraits of English aristo- cratic ladies by van Dyck; and, particularly unusual for a Jewish collection, a Last judgment by Jakob de Backer.28 Apparently it was not even inappropriate for a member of the Jewish faith to own a Last judgment, which in the Christian iconography has to include the figure of Christ.29 Thus it would appear that for the majority of the different faiths religious paintings were viewed as unproblematic, at least in the private sphere, and biblical representations were not used as a means of defining the various Reformed factions. All the more remarkable, then, is the case of Rem- brandt's student Jan Victors.30 His paintingjacob bury- ing the idols under the oak tree by Sichem, a rarely de- picted scene from Genesis 35:4, is in many ways programmatic (fig. 2).3' As a painter of biblical histo- ries, Victors uncompromisingly and, as far as is known, without exception, chose to paint themes from the Old Testament. This limitation is unique in the Rembrandt circle, and has led art historians to mistakenly seek Vic- tors's patrons among the Jews of Amsterdam.32 Instead, as Christian Tumpel pointed out in I983, Victors's choice of subject should be seen in the context of his orthodox Calvinist beliefs.33 A previously unknown source, to be discussed in detail below, seems to confirm Tiimpel's hypothesis. Although it is not possible to engage here in an in- depth description of Protestantism's complex relation- ship to the visual arts, some indication of Calvin's posi- tion is necessary. As is well known, Calvin was more severe in his condemnation of images than were either Luther or most of the other reformers.34 In his Institutio of 1536 he listed the prohibition of images as the second 25 See V.

This inventory, now in the Royal Library in Brussels (MS I194), was originally published by F. Muller, "Catalo- gus der schilderijen van Diego Duarte, te Amsterdam in 0682, met de prijzen van aankoop en taxatie," De Oude Tild (i870), pp. 397-402. Muller's indications were corrected on some important points by G. Dogaer, "De inventaris der schilderijen van Diego Duarte," Jaarboek van bet Konink/ik Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen (1971), pp. 195-221. In particular, Dogaer was able to show that the original site of the collection was Antwerp (p. i98, note Io). 27 See E.R.

Another un- usual example demonstrates that even among the ultra-doctrinal Men- nonites there were certain individuals who were not so rigid in their practices when it came to matters of art: Hendrick Uylenburgh's wife allowed herself to be portrayed by Rembrandt in a fantastic oriental costume, a most unconventional move considering the strict dress code of the group they belonged to. See S.A.C. Dudok van Heel, "Doopsgezinden en schilderkunst in de I7de eeuw: leerlingen, op- drachtgevers en verzamelaars van Rembrandt," Doopsgezinde Bjdra- gen 6 (i980), p. io8. A copy of the painting is listed in the i637 inventory of the Mennonite preacher and painter Lambert Jacobsz (ca. 1592-i637) as "Noch een cleine Oostersche vrouwen tronie, het conterfeisel van H. Ulenburgs huysvrouwe nae Rembrant" ("Another small head of an oriental woman, the portrait of Hendrik Uylen- burgh's wife, after Rembrandt"). 30 See Manuth, op. cit. (note 25), pp. 44-68.

Copenhagen, Statens Museum for Kunst commandment of the Decalogue. In contrast to Luther, Calvin was unrelenting in his rejection of anthropo- morphic representations of God the Father: since it was impossible to capture him in visible bodily form, he argued, any image at all would be sacrilegious. God's enormity and majesty could not be perceived by the human eye and therefore could not be represented. Cal- vin also prohibited the possession of such pictures, even in cases where they would not be misused for idolatry. He wrote: "Meanwhile, seeing that this brutish stupid- ity has overspread the globe, men longing after visible forms of God, and so forming deities of wood and stone, silver and gold, or of any other dead and corruptible matter, we must hold it as a first principle, that as often as any form is assigned to God, his glory is corrupted by an impious lie."35 31 Copenhagen, Statens Museum for Kunst; oil on canvas, i8o x 194 cm; the work is signed "Johan' Victors" at lower left.

Miller, "Jan Victors: an Old Testament subject in the Indianapolis Museum of Art," Perceptions 2 (i982), pp. 22-29, has shown that a painting by Victors with an Old Testament subject was in the collection of an Amsterdam Jew in I 677. In her opinion, this supports Zafran's hypothesis and thus provides an explanation for the large number of "Judaic themes" (sic) in Victors's oeuvre (p. 28). Although without reference to Zafran and Miller, C. Tumpel has expressed his doubts that Victors worked primarily for Jewish patrons: see "Die Reformation und die Kunst der Niederlan- de" in exhib. cat. Luther und die Folgen fur die Kunst, ed. W. Hofmann, Hamburg (Hamburger Kunsthalle) &amp; Munich i983, pp. 309-2I, esp. p. 317. Miller, too, has distanced herself from her earlier statements, writing in her work of i985 that "no real patterns of patronage can be charted from such scanty data;" see Miller, op. cit.

Copenhagen, Statens Museum for Kunst Understandably, this issue played an important role in the definition of Protestant belief in the Netherlands, particularly in the early period of religious and political emancipation from Catholic and Habsburg Spain. As the Reformed Church became more and more estab- lished, however, the controversy abated. In theological circles, however, the question as to what images were permissible continued to give rise to complaints and discussion. According to the strictest Calvinists, those who violated the ban were not punished with the proper rigor. One such case was the Amsterdam sculptor Hen- drick de Keyser. On i9 December i6I3, dominie Lucas was ordered to take de Keyser to task for his statue of St John the Evangelist for the Janskerk in Den Bosch. There seems to have been some fear that the figure would be "misused for idolatry by all who came to the church." A week later Lucas could report to the parish council that "in order to avoid causing any offense" de Keyser had assured him that he would "discontinue his work on the statue."36 The Reformed Church had been the only faith al- lowed to worship openly in Haarlem since I 58i. As late 36 J. Z. Kannegieter, "Het St. Jansbeeld van het Bossche oxaal," Oud Holland 59 (1942), pp. I IO-I i: "...aldaer in de Kerk tot afgoderij gebruyckt,... het beelt, om ergenis te mijden, van der hant te leggen." The controversial sculpture is probably identical with the alabaster figure of the standing evangelist now in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London. The attribution of the work to Hendrick de Keyser follows E. Neurdenburg, "Hendrick de Keyser en het oxaal van Coenraat van Noremberg," Bulletin Nederlands Oudheid Bond i3 (n.d.), pp. I59-62.

Interestingly, the initiative against de Keyser's sculpture came originally from the Amsterdam Reformed Church council and not from the Amsterdam city council; for the contrary view see W.T. Kloek in exhib. cat. Dawn of the Golden Age, p. 40.</page><page sequence="9">Denomination and iconography 243 as i6i9 and i622, however, the parish council was still busy demanding the removal of the remaining represen- tations of saints, so-called "public idols" ("publijcke affgoden"), from the city: for example "a St Bavo on the Grote Kerk, a Holy Family in the Pand, a St Nicholas on Witte Herensteeg, a St Anne on Bakenessergracht, in the Prinsenhof a statue of God the Father and a St Hubert."37 Interestingly, a fair portion of the popula- tion had remained true to its old beliefs.38 Catholics were still clients for paintings with religious subject matter, destined either for private use or for the decora- tion of clandestine churches. A case in point is Jacob de Wet's Twenty-four elders before God the Father and the Lamb, signed and dated i649 and now in the collection of the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen (fig. 3).39 The subject points to the liturgy for All Saints' Day from the book of Reve- lation as the iconographic source, an assumption further supported by the texts being held by the lion and the angel. The representation of God the Father in human form also speaks in favor of a Catholic context for the work. The conspicuous praying figure on the right is not mentioned in the biblical text, but can be explained by reference to a typical Haarlem institution. She is prob- ably a "klopje," one of the Catholic lay sisters respon- sible for the care of the sick, the elderly and the poor, who also played an important role in the (unsuccessful) attempts to re-Catholicize the city. Pieter Fransz. de Grebber's Man of sorrows (fig. 4), monogrammed and dated i 632, was also made for a Catholic patron, prob- ably as an altarpiece.40 De Grebber, himself a Catholic, produced numerous history paintings for clandestine 4 Pieter de Grebber, Man of sorrows, i632.

Between i 648 and i650 he belonged to the group of painters who worked for Amalia van Solms on the embellishment of Huis ten Bosch.42 How far apart ideology and reality actually were when it came to decorating Protestant houses of worship can be readily demonstrated by the many works from before the Reformation that can still be seen in Dutch churches today. The relief busts (1552) in the choir of the Boven- kerk in Kampen, which include a figure of Christ, are but one example.43 Between I538 and I541 Jan Aertsz. Terwen (15Ii-89) decorated the choir stalls of the Groote Kerk (Onze Lieve Vrouwenkerk) in Dordrecht with biblical scenes and representations of the saints. Although the city had joined the revolt against Spain in 1572, and in I578 became the site of the first national synod of the Reformed Church, no one took offense at these prominently placed art works. In I 609 the church- wardens made a most surprising move, recorded as fol- lows in the parish register: "And since the men's bench P - _ . ..,......=.. ....- . , Abrahmandtt re a e 'I _ S ,3 1:00;;; t:E fl44 5 Rembrandt, Abraham and the three angels, etching (B29), I656 in the Grote Kerk, the pulpit and especially the chairs and the facings were never cleaned and therefore criti- cized by all passersby, the bursar, with the prior knowl- edge of my lords the churchwardens, has employed Jan Willemsz. Smit, also called Jan de Soete, for this purpo- se, paying him i i stuivers a day out of his own purse." So this relic of the Catholic past was not only saved, but was cleaned and restored as a result of public protest. In i66i there appear to have been plans to "remove the popish benches," but the wardens refused to heed the parish council and the work remained intact.44 Rembrandt, who kept his distance from the orthodox Calvinists, dealt with the problem of representing God the Father in various ways. The decision for or against such an image was generally determined by the visual tradition. As is well known, the artist based his i656 engraving Abraham and the three angels on an Indian miniature; he also characterized one of the angels as God the Father by giving him the form of a wise old man (fig. 5). Clearly, certain iconographic tropes were permissi- ble in the graphic arts that would have been unthinkable in a painting. Here, too, however, there were exceptions, as Aert de Gelder's treatment of the same subject in the Boymans-van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam effec- tively demonstrates (fig. 6). Non-Catholic artists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries rarely wrote on the problem of anthropo- 41 See P.

One exception was Henry Peacham, who commented in his i6o6 drawing manual: "there be some things that ought to be free from the pencill, as the picture of God the father: or (as I have seene) the whole Trinitie painted in a glassewindow: which one cannot do without artificiall blasphemy, and reviving from hell the old heresie of the Anthropomorphites who supposed God to be in the shape of an old man, sitting upon his throne in a white Robe, with a triple crowne on his head."46 Nearly ioo years later, Gerard de Lairesse de- voted a chapter in the second part of his Groot schilder- boek to the problem of representing God the Father in human form. Under the heading "Disquisition touch- ing the representation of the Trinity" the author com- plained of the "concern" among artists that had resulted from the debate surrounding depictions of God. He argued that "the greatest part of Christendom (Holland, England and a part of Germany excepted) allow the representation of... God the Father, in the shape of an old man with a long grey beard and hair." This being the case, anthropomorphic images had a kind of tradition, one that could be justified and that he supported: "I think then, that a painter has no nearer expressions in such representations where God himself is acting, than to exhibit his figure in an human shape, as best agreeing with those likenesses."47 In light of what has been said, Jan Victors's strict stance regarding this problematic aspect of artistic crea- 46 Henry Peacham, The art of drawing with the pen, London (Ri- chard Braddock) i6o6, p. 8. 47 G. de Lairesse, Het groot schilderboek, Haarlem I740, vol. 2, book 9, ch. 12, pp. i62-69, esp. p. i63-64: "Het grootste deel der Christenheid (Holland, Engeland, en een kleen gedeelte van Duitsch- land uitgezondert) stemmen eenpaarig de verbeelding... toe...

The English of this quotation is from G. de Lairesse, The art of painting, trans. J. F. Fritsch, London 1738, pp. 471-72.</page><page sequence="12">246 VOLKER MANUTH tion seems all the more remarkable. As an orthodox Cal- vinist whose beliefs had a strong influence on his work, Victors felt bound to adhere to the tenets of the Deca- logue. Furthermore, he abstained altogether from de- picting Christ or events from the New Testament. He seldom painted Old Testament scenes that involved the presence of angels since, according to Calvin, divine announcements by these supernatural messengers re- quired the presence of Christ as "mediator." As Debra Miller has pointed out, Victors's oeuvre contains no nudes.48 In cases such as the Dresden Finding of Moses of i653 (fig. 7) the artist avoided the problem by depict- ing not the traditional moment of the baby's discovery by the bathing handmaidens, but rather a later scene where he is being nursed by his mother.49 It should also be noted that the biblical themes that are absent in Victors's work are precisely those that were the subject of one of the most virulent Protestant attacks on religious painting. The work referred to is Idolelen- chus (fig. 8) by Johannes Evertz. Geesteranus (1586- I622), a Latin polemic against the fine arts. The book was translated and annotated by Geesteranus's friend, the poet and theologian Dirck Rafaelsz. Camphuysen (1586-I627).5o Camphuysen, who was himself trained as a painter, 5 I praised Geesteranus and his conclusions, which amounted to a radical and all-encompassing re- jection of art. As a professional artist, Victors could hardly follow them to this extreme. Nonetheless, he never depicted scenes that the author of the Idolelenchus had condemned for their ability to awaken desire in whatever form: the naked Eve, Lot and his daughters, Jael and Judith, David and Bathsheba, or Susanna bath- ing. Victors's art moved solely in the spheres expressly approved by Calvin: he painted only historical events (historiae ac res gestae) or multi-figural scenes and indivi- dual persons (imagines acformae corporum) without ref- erence to history,52 such as portraits and genre scenes. The artist appears to have cultivated contacts with the most rigid Calvinists in Amsterdam. On 25 June i645 Petrus Wittewrongel (i609-62) baptized Victors's daughter in the Noorderkerk.53 Wittewrongel came from Middelburg, a center of pietistic orthodoxy; he had studied in Leiden and was active in Renesse and Zierik- zee before coming to Amsterdam in i638. He was con- sidered a stalwart and stern clergyman: he was strongly influenced by the Puritanical ideas of the orthodox wing of the Reformed Church-a movement that preached scrupulous adherence to all aspects of Protestant teach- ings.54 He opposed everything that he felt broke God's commandments: dancing, drinking, entertainment, ex- pensive clothes, the profanation of the day of rest, and so on.55 Wittewrongel had also helped Victors to his only known public commission, two large canvases depicting the lady regents of the Reformed Church Orphanage (Diaconieweeshuis) with their orphans, painted be- tween I657 and I662.56 In i656, after long and difficult 48 Miller, op. cit.

The first edition of Camphuysen's Stichtelycke rjjmen appeared in i624; in the course of the seventeenth century it became the most popular songbook of the Protestants and by i658 it had reached its 12th printing (published by Joannes Naeranus in Rotter- dam).

The Idolelenchus left a lasting impression in artistic circles; as Houbraken reported, op. cit., p. 126, many thought Camphuysen himself was the author: "He [Camphuy- sen] left a son who practiced painting, but cannot be greatly praised for his work. We find it strange that a father who set out to frighten everyone away from art did not arouse a dislike of art in him. Indeed, the good man had already been accused of foolishness until we came into possession of the biography of D.R. Camphuysen, printed by J.

Victors's devotion to this form of Calvinism certainly did not further his career as an artist. The members of his religious community could not be counted among the art patrons of Amsterdam. As the prosperity of his former fellow student Govert Flinck pointed up to him, it was those artists connected with the liberal Remon- strant regents who were most in demand. Their need to visually underscore their prestige kept pace with their growing influence, guaranteeing a steady flow of com- missions. Nonetheless, although only moderately suc- cessful when compared to Flinck and Bol, Victors was occasionally able to interest a few members of this rich and powerful elite in his art. The 1707 inventory of Maria Temminck (i662- I703), widow of Joan Huydecoper III (i656-1703), for example, lists a number of paintings by Victors. 57 The majority were genre scenes such as a Vegetable seller, a Fortune-teller and a Wedding. The two biblical paintings mentioned were given nearly the same descriptive title: "Jacob's blessing by Victors" and "Jacob's blessing by the old [sic] Victors," probably referring to works now in Warsaw and Budapest. 5 8 Because of their ages at the time of the works' crea- tion, Joan Huydecoper i i i and Maria Temminck could not have been the first owners of the paintings, which they probably inherited. In my opinion, the purchaser (and possibly the original client) was the husband's grandfather, an art-loving and influential regent with well-documented connections to the Rembrandt cir- cle. 59 In I 628, at the beginning of his career, Joan Huy- decoper (I 599-i66I),60 Lord of Maarsseveen and Neerdijk, had been among the signatories of a petition sponsored by the city fathers of Amsterdam that de- manded religious freedom for the exiled Remonstrants. In i629 he became a magistrate and on io August i637 he was knighted by Queen Christina of Sweden. Be- tween i639 and i642 the architect Philip Vingboons built him a magnificent canal house, referred to as "het huis van Huydecoper," destroying three older buildings in the process.6' In i65i Huydecoper became a burgo- master, an office to which he was re-elected no fewer than six times before his death. In addition, he was a churchwarden, a captain in the crossbowmen's civic guard and a dike-reeve. In the course of his life, Huydecoper became one of the most important art patrons in the city. Gary Schwartz has discussed this role in detail,62 pointing in particular to a document that indicates that Huydecoper owned "a head by warmbrant" (i.e. Rembrandt) as early as i628, i.e. before the artist moved to Amsterdam.63 It was Govert Flinck, however, who became Huyde- coper's painter of choice. In celebration of the Peace of Munster, Flinck was asked to execute a group portrait of the Amsterdam civic guard, led at the time by Captain 57 Amsterdam City Archives, Notarial Archive, Notary J.

Io).66 In contrast to his brother Lijnt- gen Jan Vossen (1572-i60i), Jan Jansz did not convert to Protestantism, a decision underscored by his mar- riage to a Catholic in I 594. His son Jan not only success- fully ran the family glassmaking business in Kalver- straat but also built a career as a poet. From i 647 to i652, and again from i653 to i667, Jan Vos was regent of the Amsterdam Playhouse. Although a Catholic, he was highly respected by the tolerant and influential rul- ing families. They seem to have been less suspicious of the poetic glassmaker, himself a great patriot and a liber- al, than of the over-zealous representatives of orthodox Calvinism who refused to stop trying to influence the course of city politics. In the many conflicts between the various Reformed groups, Vos was clearly on the side of his tolerant patrons in the Amsterdam government. In i652 a fire destroyed the old town hall and it be- came necessary to complete its replacement as soon as possible. Jan Vos was appointed to carry out the glazing for this and all other public buildings. This was an im- portant step in his career and a guarantee of future pros- perity, and it is certainly no coincidence that Cornelis de Graeff, who had been Vos's patron for some time, was the president of the college of burgomasters at the time. It is also not surprising that many of Vos's works are dedicated to such influential members of Amsterdam's ruling elite as Andries Bicker, Cornelis de Graeff and Joan Huydecoper. The poems and rhymes were a form of thanks for their support and hospitality.

Particularly popular were the verses on works of art that were designed to honor the patron as much as the painter. Vos was intimately familiar with the Amsterdam art world. It was on the occasion of a festive meeting of the city's artists in i654 that he composed his "Strydt tus- schen de Doodt en Natuur, of Zeege der Schilderkunst" (The struggle between death and nature, or the triumph of painting), a long epic poem dedicated to his benefac- tor Cornelis de Graeff. 67 Among the painters he praised in this work were Rembrandt, Govert Flinck, Ferdi- nand Bol and Salomon and Philips Koninck. A number of other documents and poems demonstrate Vos's close ties with the Rembrandt circle, particularly with Bol and Flinck: in i659, the two painters, Vos, and Vondel were honored by the burgomasters (including Joan Huyde- coper) for the work they had done for the reception of the Electress of Brandenburg.68 Albert Blankert has characterized this foursome as "a group of artists who not only moved in the same circle but also worked for the same patron(s)."69 It is through Jan Vos that we know of additional artists who were associated with Rembrandt and whose paintings were in Huydecoper's collection, such as Salomon Koninck, Jan Lievens and Joachim von Sandrart.70 Vos's uncommissioned occasional poetry-so-called "aphorisms" or lampoons-reveals the Catholic's criti- cal, even vicious attitude towards his strictly Calvinist contemporaries. In a four-line poem addressed to an anonymous person with the initials "B.L.F.," Vos de- rided the credulity of those who readily believed men "who spoke from the Bible." In his view, Satan was capable of doing this as well.7' His deep disapproval of the Protestant principle of sola scriptura cannot be mis- taken. Vos also inveighed against the Calvinist ban on representations of God the Father: "To a certain painter. He who dares paint God's picture on canvas is a sinner, you say, Because no man has ever seen God. Who has led you to this false conclusion? God made man in his own image for the most glorious of destinies. He who has seen a man, does he not then see an image of God?"7 2 In his work on Jan Vos, Gregor Weber has interpreted a number of such poems as a reaction to the Calvinist attitude towards art.73 In some of the verses, however, it is apparent that Vos's aim was not merely a general critique. It seems that he also often used actual cases from the Amsterdam art world as the basis for his pole- mics. In a satirical work addressed to a brass caster with the initials "J.G.," Vos criticized the production of a monumental candelabra as a gift to the Shogun in Japan. Instead of a candelabra, whose only purpose was to illu- minate the idols of a heathen ruler, the poet thought the 67 On this poem see G.J.M.

"J.G." refers to the Amsterdam caster Joost Gerritz who, in i638, had been commissioned to make the work by the East India Com- pany. 74 Victors's idiosyncratic practice of painting biblical subjects but refusing to depict either God the Father or Christ must have offered another welcome opportunity for Vos to sharpen his satirical skills. Although, as far as we know, he never wrote a poem about any of Victors's works, there is one rhyme which seems to point directly to the artist: "Hans would not paint a figure of Christ. Hans paints beautifully, admirably, so Fame tells us Nature gave Apelles great gifts, but Hans even greater ones. He paints all things, except divinity. Hans is a virtuous man, but a 'God-less' painter."75 The painter in the verse, mockingly characterized as a commendable and pious man, and an artist with natural talent (although "god-less" in his representations), ap- pears to be none other than Rembrandt's student Jan Victors.76 On 13 June i6i9 he was baptized "Hans" in the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam.77 This was a name frequently found among Flemish immigrant families like Victors's. Vos's satirical poem about the Calvinist painter is an interesting commentary on the icono- graphic controversy within the Rembrandt circle. It is also the only non-archival reference to Victors before the beginning of the nineteenth century.78 It is probable that there were other orthodox Cal- vinist painters of the period who renounced religious themes out of personal conviction and not only because there was a lack of official church commissions. In order to paint freely, profitably and without moral conflict there were enough opportunities in the other genres, for example in portraiture or landscape. Is the cause of such specialization really explained either by reference to the absence of church patronage or to the preferences and talents of individual artists? Victors's compromise-his decision to limit himself as a history painter to non- controversial scenes from the Old Testament or to non- religious subjects-offers an interesting starting point for the further investigation of the conditions surround- ing the development of specialization in Dutch art of the seventeenth century.
