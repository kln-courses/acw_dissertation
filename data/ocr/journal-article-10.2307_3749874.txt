<plain_text><page sequence="1">Animals and the Unity of Psychology GARETH B. MATTHEWS By 'the unity of psychology' I mean something one might also express by saying that the psychology of human beings is part of the psychology of animals generally. Perhaps there are several different ways of trying to trace out the ramifications of the idea that psychology is one. A central consideration, I think, is likely to be some sort of principle of continuity up and down the scale of nature. The idea would be that up and down the scale of animated or ensouled things ('psyched up' beings, empsucha) there are always psychological continuities, never any strict discontinuity. If human beings can get angry, can want to get ahead in life, can see an illusion, can develop an Oedipus complex, then so can some lower animal do either the very same thing, something similar, or at least something analogous. I shall speak of a psychological state, act or function in a lower animal as being a model of, or as modelling, a state, act or function in a higher animal when the former is either the very same kind of thing as the latter, a similar kind of thing to the latter, or at least analogous to the latter. The Principle of Psychological Continuity is then the principle that psychological acts, states and functions in lower animals model those in higher animals. I have been making free use of the idea that species of animals can be put in order of higher and lower. Before Darwin, many people thought this could be done on the basis of natural superiority. Since Darwin, it has come to seem more interesting and important to try to order species according to stages of evolutionary development. Since lines of evolutionary development may run quite independently of each other, it is not possible to place all species in a single scale of evolutionary development. But I shall suppose that independent lines of development can be melded together sufficiently well to yield a good general placement of species on a single scale from lower to higher. We can now state a Principle of Psychological Continuity that gives expression to the idea of the unity of psychology. I propose this: For any given psychological state, act or function, 0, if a given animal belongs to some species other than the lowest one and that animal is capable of 0, then there is an animal of some lower species such that the lower animal is capable of some psychological state, act or function, V', and b' is a model of b. Philosophy 53 1978 437</page><page sequence="2">Gareth B. Matthews Consider some examples. Suppose attentiveness is a psychological state to be found in human beings. Then, according to the Principle of Psycho- logical Continuity, there is an animal of some lower species, say a rabbit, such that the rabbit is capable of a psychological state that is a model of attentiveness in human beings. Again, suppose that the projection of one's anxieties on someone or something is a psychological function to be found in people, or perhaps in chimps; then according to the Principle of Psycho- logical Continuity there is an animal of some lower species, say a dog, such that there is a psychological function in the dog that models anxiety projection in chimps or human beings. My use of the term 'model' here is meant to express what I take to be a working conception among psychologists and much of the lay public. That the notion of one thing modelling another calls for serious analysis I do not question; but I cannot attempt such analysis here. I can only hope that the lack of a satisfactory analysis will not vitiate the discussion to follow. The Principle of Psychological Continuity is quite different from a principle of behavioural continuity. According to the latter there would be, for any type or pattern of behaviour to be found in members of a given species, a model of that behaviour type, or pattern, in members of some lower species. One could easily accept a principle of behavioural continuity without accepting the Principle of Psychological Continuity. One could, for example, suppose that although the behaviour of other higher primates models human behaviour in various interesting and non-trivial ways, there is in the non-human primates no psychological act, state or function that models any act, state or function in human beings for the quite sufficient reason that non-human primates are incapable of psychological acts, states and functions. Though I want to contrast the Principle of Psychological Continuity with principles of behavioural continuity, I want to leave the former open to a behaviouristic interpretation. Thus a behaviourist who supposes that, say, psychological states are merely complex dispositions to behave in certain specifiable ways can accept the Principle of Psychological Con- tinuity by being prepared to tell the same kind of story about psychological acts, states and functions in non-human animals that she or he tells about psychological acts, states and functions in human beings. Donald R. Griffin, in a fascinating little book called The Question of Animal Awareness: Evolutionary Continuity of Mental Experience (New York, I976), formulates a principle of psychological continuity in deli- berately anti-behaviouristic terms when, for example, he speaks of the hypothesis 'that mental experiences, like other attributes of animals and men, exhibit a continuity of variation and are not typologically discrete, all-or-nothing qualities totally restricted to a single species' (p. 68). But a behaviourist such as K. S. Lashley (one of Griffin's stalking horses) can accept psychological continuity in his own terms-as is perhaps clear from the following words of Lashley's, cited by Griffin: 438</page><page sequence="3">Animals and the Unity of Psychology The question of where mind or consciousness enters in the phylogenetic scale and of the nature of conscious experience as distinct from physio- logical processes are pseudo-problems, arising from misconceptions of the nature of the data revealed by introspection. A comparative study of the behaviour of animals is a comparative study of mind, by any meaning- ful definition of the term.1 The two giants of ancient philosophy, Plato and Aristotle, both accepted the Principle of Psychological Continuity; but their reasoning on the matter is strikingly different, one from the other. Plato accepted the Pythagorean idea of metempsychosis, or transmigration of psyches. In principle it is possible, he thought, that your psyche or mine might next animate a dog or a fish. Psychological acts, states and functions in lower animals model those in higher animals for the very good reason that the souls or psyches of lower animals are the functional equivalent of degene- rate human psyches. In fact Plato sometimes suggests that your soul in its next incarnation may go to some human or sub-human animal whose characteristic virtues, that is, whose functional excellences, are most like those you develop in this life.2 Aristotle accepted the Principle of Psychological Continuity on quite a different basis. His threefold classification of psyches-(i) plant or nutritive souls, (2) animal or sensitive souls and (3) human or rational souls-already incorporates limited continuity, since Aristotle supposed that the psychic functions of sensitive souls include nutritive functions and the psychic functions of human souls include both sensitive and nutritive functions.3 But the Aristotelian classification scheme also suggests radical discon- tinuity. It suggests that there is nothing in plants similar or analogous to sensation in animals and, more to our purpose, nothing in non-human animals similar or analogous to reason in human beings. Aristotle counters this suggestion of discontinuity in various places, but nowhere more eloquently than in this famous passage from the beginning of Book VIII of the History of Animals: In the great majority of animals there are traces of psychical qualities or attitudes, which qualities are more markedly differentiated in the case of human beings. For just as we pointed out resemblances in the physical organs, so in a number of animals we observe gentleness or fierceness, mildness or cross temper, courage or timidity, fear or confidence, high spirit or low cunning, and, with regard to intelligence, something equivalent to sagacity. Some of these qualities in man, as compared with- the corresponding qualities in animals, differ only quantitatively: that is 1 'Persistent Problems in the Evolution of Mind,' Quarterly Review of Biology, 24 (I959), 28-42; quoted in Griffin, p. I I7. 2 E.g., Phaedo 8id-82b, Timaeus 9oe-9ic. 3 De Anima B3. 439</page><page sequence="4">Gareth B. Matthews to say, a man has more or less of this quality, and an animal has more or less of some other; other qualities in man are represented by analogous and not identical qualities: for instance, just as in man we find know- ledge, wisdom, and sagacity, so in certain animals there exists some other natural potentiality akin to these . . . so that one is quite justified in saying that, as regards man and animals, certain psychical qualities are identical with one another, whilst others resemble, and others are analogous to, each other (588ai8-b3, Wentworth Thompson, trans.). It seems to have been close observation of animal life that led Aristotle to affirm the Principle of Psychological Continuity. In a similar way it was observation that led the contemporary psychologist, D. 0. Hebb, to ascribe emotions and psychological attitudes to non-human primates on roughly the same basis that one ascribes them to one's fellow human beings. In a classic article called 'Emotion in Man and Animal' (Psychological Review, 53 (1946)) Hebb reports that the staff of the Yerkes Laboratory of Primate Biology tried for two years to avoid using what were called, disapprovingly, 'anthropocentric descriptions in the study of temperament'. 'A formal experiment,' he reports, 'was set up to provide records of the actual behaviour of the adult chimpanzees, and from these records to get an objective statement of the differences from animal to animal' (p. 88). But the result was something utterly useless. 'All that resulted,' writes Hebb, 'was an almost endless series of specific acts in which no order or meaning could be found.' 'On the other hand,' he adds, 'by the use of frankly anthropomorphic concepts of emotion and attitude one could quickly and easily describe the peculiarities of the individual animals, and with this information a newcomer to the staff could handle the animals as he could not safely otherwise' (ibid.). Relieved of methodological scruples, the staff found they could rather easily agree among themselves that one animal was fearful, another nervous, a third shy. They naturally characterized one as friendly to human beings, though quick-tempered, whereas they found another to hate human beings, as they quite naturally put it. Hebb's patient and nicely detailed discussion of emotion in human and non-human primates leads persuasively to a number of conclusions, including this one: The recognition of emotion in man and animals is not fundamentally different. Conceptually, the states of changed responsiveness discri- minated are the same in both cases and have the same relationship to overt behavior (p. I04). Actually the Principle of Psychological Continuity is very weak. What we know about the evolution of species pretty much guarantees that, so long as there is some lower species at all capable of psychological acts, 440</page><page sequence="5">Animals and the Unity of Psychology states or functions, there will be something in the psychological repertory of a lower species at least analogous to, if not outright similar to, what the higher species is capable of. Yet modern thought offers a very important threat to the Principle of Psychological Continuity. It is Descartes' concept of mind. According to Descartes all human animals, and among animals only the human ones, have minds. Moreover, since all and only things that are or have minds are conscious, all human animals, and among animals only the human ones, are conscious beings. Thus, according to Descartes, despite the apparent continuity between human beings and lower animals, human beings are conscious whereas non-human animals are mere machines, automata. The psychology of brutes (or better: the 'psychology' of brutes) reduces to physics, whereas human psychology does not. In his Reply to Objections V4 Descartes insists, in effect, that it could be only by an equivocation that one might speak in the same context of 'the psychology of brutes' and 'the psychology of human beings'. More exactly his point is that we equivocate on 'soul' or 'psyche' when we use it for, now the life principle of brutes and now the mind of human beings. Here is what he says: You here pursue the question of the obscurity arising out of the ambi- guity of the word soul, an obscurity which I took such pains to remove that it is wearisome to repeat here what I have said. Therefore I shall declare only, that names have been conferred on things for the most part by the inexpert, and that for this reason they do not always fit the things with sufficient accuracy; that it is not our part to change them after custom has accepted them, but only to permit the emendation of their meanings, when we perceive that others do not understand them aright. Thus because probably men in the earliest times did not distinguish in us that principle in virtue of which we are nourished, grow and perform all those operations which are common to us with the brutes apart from any thought, from that by which we think, they called them both by the single name soul; then, perceiving the distinction between nutrition and thinking, they called that which thinks mind, believing also that this was the chief part of the soul. But I, perceiving that the principle by which we are nourished is wholly distinct from that by means of which we think, have declared that the name soul when used for both is equivocal; and I say that, when soul is taken to mean the primary actuality or chief essence of man, it must be understood to apply only to the principle by which we think, and I have called it by the name mind as often as possible in order to avoid ambiguity; for I consider the mind not as part of the soul but as the whole of that soul which thinks. 4The Philosophical Works of Descartes, Vol. II, Haldane &amp; Ross (trans.) (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I934), 2IO-2 iI. 44I</page><page sequence="6">Gareth B. Matthews The psyche of a human being, according to Descartes, is her or his mind. No non-human animal, not even the highest non-human primate, has a mind. Brutes have psyches, souls, but only in another sense of the term. What in them is called a psyche is only a non-conscious (indeed, Descartes supposes, mechanical) principle of life. By denying that non-human animals have psyches in the same sense in which human beings have them, and by, therefore, denying that non- human beings have psychological acts, states and functions in the same sense in which human beings have them, Descartes rejected the Principle of Psychological Continuity. But he accepted a principle of behavioural continuity. In fact, supposing as he did that living animals are machines of a sort, he supposed not only that their behaviour models human behaviour but also that the behaviour of mechanical artifacts models the behaviour of living animals, as he declares in, for example, these passages: Doubtless when the swallows come in Spring, they operate like clocks. The actions of honey bees are of the same nature, and the discipline of cranes in flight, and of apes fighting, if it is true that they keep discipline. (Letter to the Marquess of Newcastle, I646)5 ... you seem to make a greater difference between living and lifeless things than there is between a clock or other automaton on the one hand, and a key or sword or other non-self-moving appliance on the other. I do not agree. (Letter to Regius, I643)6 Some people have tried to soften the force of Descartes' distinction between things that are capable of consciousness and those that are not. The modern notion of consciousness and the concept of mind that goes with it are, to a great extent, inventions of Descartes. They have their natural home in the context of his rational reconstruction of knowledge and in his use of the method of systematic doubt. When Descartes denies mind and consciousness to non-human animals he is using his technical terminology to mark dramatically a distinction that we might otherwise overlook or underemphasize (or so this reasoning goes). Such an effort to soften the force of Descartes' distinction between the minded and the mindless is, in my opinion, misguided. One thing that shows it to be misguided is Descartes' own insistence that the first principle of action in a living, but mindless, being is a mechanical principle quite like the mechanical principle of a watch or other automaton. What kind of attitude is appropriate to the consideration of a fine watch? One might appropriately be ravished into admiration for the watchmaker. 5 Descartes, Philosophical Letters, A. Kenny (trans.) (Oxford: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1970), 207. 6 Ibid., p. I33. 442</page><page sequence="7">Animals and the Unity of Psychology One might be pleased by the watch's ornamentation or annoyed by its un- dependability. But one family of attitudes would be clearly inappropriate (no matter how finely wrought the watch, or how dependable, or undepend- able, its action)-namely, those attitudes of sympathy and concern which one may have for the feelings of another person. When Descartes insists that the first principle of action in a living, but non-human, being is a mechanical principle quite like that of a wound-up watch, we must conclude that, according to him, attitudes of sympathy and concern for the feelings of x are clearly inappropriate, where x is only a goldfish, or even a dog or a chimp; their souls are mechanical. It is this point that should keep us from dismissing as simply scurrilous the stories of cruelty to animals told of the Cartesians at Port Royal. 'They administered beatings to dogs with perfect indifference,' we are told, and made fun of those who pitied the creatures as if they felt pain. They said the animals were clocks; that the cries they emitted when struck were only the noise of a little spring that had been touched, but that the whole body was without feeling. They nailed the poor animals up on boards by their four paws to vivisect them and see the circulation of the blood which was a great subject of controversy.7 What reason did Descartes have for denying consciousness to non- human beings? Before I attempt to answer that question for myself I shall consider two lines of reasoning ascribed to Descartes by Zeno Vendler in his book, Res Cogitans: An Essay in Rational Psychology,8 and the support for one of these lines of reasoning offered by Norman Malcolm in his American Philosophical Association presidential address, 'Thoughtless Brutes'.9 First Vendler. According to the first account Vendler offers, Descartes reasons this way: Animals do not talk, that is, do not express thoughts. They do express, however, their passions. Now if they had thoughts as well, they would express them or at least try to express them. Therefore, they have no thoughts.10 Streamlined slightly, the argument is this: Argument A (I) Animals do not talk, that is, do not express thoughts. 7 Leonora Rosenfield, From Beast-Machine to Man-Machine (New York: Columbia, i968), 54. 8 Ithaca, New York: Cornell, I972. 9 Reprinted in Norman Malcolm, Thought and Knowledge (Ithaca, New York: Cornell, I977), 40-57. 10 Vendler, p. I53. 443</page><page sequence="8">Gareth B. Matthews (2) If animals had thoughts they would express them. Therefore (3) Animals do not have thoughts. Argument A is an amalgam of these two arguments: Argument Ai (ia) Animals do not talk. (za) If animals had thoughts they would talk. Therefore (3) Animals do not have thoughts. Argument Az (ib) Animals do not express thoughts. (2) If animals had thoughts they would express them. Therefore (3) Animals do not have thoughts. Both (ia) and (ib) might be contested. But (ia) is certainly less question- begging than (ib). Yet it is (2), rather than (2a), that is the more plausible. We cannot, of course, put together (ia) and (2) and get (3) as a valid conclusion. So I propose to concentrate on Argument AI, as being, any- way, the less question-begging of the two valid arguments. To get from (3) in Argument Ai to what Vendler calls 'the notorious doctrine of the automism of brutes' we shall also need some such argument as this: Argument B (3) Animals do not have thoughts. (4) If animals were not automata but conscious beings, animals would have thoughts. Therefore (5) Animals are not conscious beings but automata. If Arguments Ai and B were both sound, we should indeed have good reason to insist that it is only by an equivocation that one could speak of the psyches of men and brutes, and hence only by an equivocation that one could speak of the psychology of men and brutes. We should then have Descartes' reason for rejecting the Principle of Psychological Continuity and, with it, the unity of psychology. Are these arguments sound? First, what about Argument AI? Premise (ia) is deceptively straightforward. No doubt no non-human animal, untutored by human beings, has a language very much like English. But non-human higher primates have recently been tutored to use American sign language, as well as languages constructed especially for them. They are capable of using these languages in a surprisingly natural and creative way. Certainly they are capable of something very much like talking. Consider, for example, this excerpt from an interview with Lucy, an eight-year-old chimpanzee, conducted by Boyce Rensberger, a reporter for the New York Times: 444</page><page sequence="9">Animals and the Unity of Psychology Reporter (holding up key): What [is] this? Lucy: [A] key. Reporter (holding a comb): What [is] this? Lucy: [A] comb (takes a comb and combs reporter's hair, then hands comb to reporter). Comb me. Reporter: O.K. (combs Lucy). Reporter: Lucy, [do] you want [to] go outside? Lucy: Outside, no. [I] want food, [an] apple. Reporter: I have no food. Sorry. The reporter commented: Brief. Not especially deep. But certainly communication.... After each exchange, Lucy and I would stare into each other's eyes for a few seconds. I do not know how she felt, but I was nervous. I was partici- pating in something extraordinary. I was conversing in my own language with a member of another species of intelligent beings.11 In fairness to Descartes one must add that, of course, no comparably good candidates for cases of inter-species conversation were known in his day. It is interesting to conjecture as to what Descartes' response might have been, had he learned of such cases. I shall not, however, pursue conjecture on that point. I want instead to turn to premise (2a). Vendler leaves it without explicit support, though his whole book, being an account of thinking in terms of speech acts, might seem to give it a certain plaus- ibility. I shall consider the support Norman Malcolm tries to give it in his paper, 'Thoughtless Brutes'. 'The relationship between language and thought must be ... so close,' Malcolm writes, 'that it is really senseless to conjecture that people may not have thoughts, and also really senseless to conjecture that animals may have thoughts.'12 So presumably (ia) and (2a) are both true. The reason (2a) is true is that the connection between having a language and having thoughts is so close that it is senseless to suppose those possessions might be separated. Though Malcolm is prepared to accept (3) as the conclusion of an, as he supposes, sound argument, he does want to defuse it a bit. To do so he draws a distinction between thinking that p and having the thought that p; people can do both, but, whereas non-human animals can do the former, they cannot, Malcolm insists, do the latter. Thus, says Malcolm, ... Descartes mistakenly equates thinking with having thoughts. His view is that a 'mind' is something that has thoughts. Now, I have 11 New York Times, 29 May I974, p. 52. 12 Malcolm, PP- 54-55. 445</page><page sequence="10">Gareth B. Matthews thoughts, but my poor doggy has none. So I am a mind, but he is not ... But we should understand what this comes to-just that he does not have thoughts; which in turn comes to just this, that he does not have a language. We can appreciate, however, that despite this the dog is not so badly off, since a great range of feelings, sensations, wants, perceptions, can be accurately attributed to him.13 Let us reflect for a moment on Malcolm's distinction between thinking that p and having the thought that p. Suppose my dog watches someone vacate her favourite chair and begins wagging her tail and lining herself up to jump up and occupy it. Consider now these sentences: (6) The dog thinks she'll be able to occupy her chair now. (7) The dog has the thought that she'll be able to occupy her chair now. Presumably Malcolm would be willing to grant me, in the imagined circumstances, the truth of (6). In turn I will grant him that (7) would be a rather pretentious, or, in other circumstances, a rather precious, way of reporting the situation. Malcolm says, 'It would sound funny to say of a dog, monkey or dolphin, that the thought that p occurred to him, or struck him, or went through his mind.'14 Malcolm also speaks of feeling 'reluctant and embarrassed' to say things like '[The dog] had the thought that the cat went up the oak tree'.15 One trouble with this is that many things that 'sound funny to say' or that we should feel 'reluctant and embarrassed' to say are nevertheless true. Moreover, in order to deny, straightforwardly, that brutes have thoughts Malcolm must say in imaginable circumstances that, although (6) is true, (7) is bound to be-not just 'funny to say' but-actually false. Is there any argument for that conclusion in Malcolm? I find none. Instead I find the suggestion of an argument for a different, but related, conclusion. It is an argument for the conclusion that (7), though not false, is senseless or meaningless or somehow empty because we do not understand what it would be to show it true. As Malcolm puts the matter, 'An undertaking of trying to find out whether the dog did or did not have the [thought that the path is slippery, that is, whether this thought did or did not occur to the dog or cross its mind] is not anything we under- stand'.16 Before I lay out the argument for this conclusion that I find suggested in Malcolm let me sketch an example. (It is similar to some of Malcolm's own examples.) Suppose that, in winter, I am in the habit of taking a shortcut to my office across the Campus Pond. I can do this satisfactorily, of course, 13 Ibid., p. 56. 14 Ibid., pp. 49-50. 15 Ibid. 16 Ibid., p. 54. 446</page><page sequence="11">Animals and the Unity of Psychology only when the weather is cold enough to keep the ice on the pond solid. Now suppose we are in the midst of a long cold spell and I take my usual shortcut. I think that the ice is solid. My behaviour in striding confidently across the ice expresses my belief that the ice is solid. Nevertheless, we may suppose, the thought that the ice is solid does not occur to me on this particular morning. Instead my mind is taken up with Aristotle, or perhaps with academic politics. Thus (8) S thinks that p does not entail (Q) The thought that p occurs to S. Neither, one might add, does (g) entail (8), for the thought that the ice is solid can occur to me without my giving it assent, without my thinking that it is true. So (8) neither entails, nor is entailed by, (9). Now the argument Malcolm suggests goes like this. The truth of a statement of the form, (8), may find expression either in verbal behaviour (in, for example, my telling you what I think) or in non-verbal behaviour (in, for example, my striding confidently across the pond). But no non- verbal behaviour can express the truth of a statement of the form, (9). The fact that a thought simply occurs to one can find expression only in some kind of verbalization. Where S is without verbal capacity, that is, without language, (9) is therefore empty, gratuitous, senseless. It is, as Malcolm says, 'not anything we understand'. That is the argument. A number of its features invite comment. I restrict myself to the claim that no non-verbal behaviour can express the truth of a statement of the form, (7), though non-verbal behaviour can express the truth of a statement of the form, (8). That claim is, I think, false. Its falsity can be shown by appeal to cases of human mutes. It can also be shown by appeal to problem-solving in non- human animals of the sort described by Wolfgang Koehler in his classic work, The Mentality of Apes (London, I925). In perhaps the most famous episode from that book the chimpanzee, Sultan, was given two hollow sticks, one of smaller diameter than the other. The smaller one could be inserted into one end of the other to make a single, longer stick. With the longer stick Sultan would be equipped to fetch a banana placed tantal- izingly near the bars of his cage. But, as Sultan himself determined by trial, neither short stick, by itself, was long enough to reach the banana. Here is the keeper's report: Sultan first of all squats indifferently on the box ... Then he gets up, picks up the two sticks, sits down again on the box and plays carelessly with them. While doing this, it happens that he finds himself holding one rod in either hand in such a way that they lie in a straight line; he pushes the thinner one a little way into the opening of the thicker, jumps up and 447</page><page sequence="12">Gareth B. Matthews is already on the run towards the railings, to which he has up to now half turned his back, and begins to draw a banana towards him with the double stick (p. I27). What the keeper's account suggests is that (io) The thought that the two sticks can be put together to make one stick occurs to Sultan and (i i) The thought that the double stick can be used to fetch a banana occurs to Sultan though it would be going beyond his report to assert that (I2) The thought that the two sticks can be put together to make a stick that can be used to fetch a banana occurs to Sultan. However, we do not need (I2). Both (io) and (ii) have the form of (9). Thus Sultan's non-verbal behaviour expresses the truth of two claims of the form, (9), in much the same way in which the non-verbal behaviour of Malcolm's dog expressed the truth of a claim of the form, (8). So this Malcolmian argument in support of (2a) fails and we have, so far as I can see, no good reason to deny that thoughts might occur to an animal without that animal's having the linguistic ability to express them verbally. Even if Argument Ai had proved to be more attractive, we should have had to worry about the soundness of Argument B. Vendler suggests that, if we construe the premises of what we are calling 'Argument B' in such a way as to give them, individually, maximum plausibility, we make the argument as a whole turn on an equivocation. The idea is that (3) is most plausible when 'to have thoughts' in (3) is taken to mean 'to think in the "propositional sense" of "think"'. But for (4) to be plausible, 'to have thoughts' must there be understood in accordance with a much broader sense of 'think'. Here then is Vendler's verdict on what amounts to the conjunction of Argument Ai and Argument B: ... whereas [Descartes] succeeds in showing that animals do not think in the [propositional] sense of 'thinking' developed earlier in this book, he fails to show that they do not think in his own sense of 'thinking' [in which x thinks if x is conscious]. What he demonstrates is that animals have no thoughts-that is, that they do not perform mental operations the objects of which can be expressed in speech. He fails to prove, how- ever, that animals do not have real sensations and feelings, emotions and passions . . .17 17 Vendler, P. 154. 448</page><page sequence="13">Animals and the Unity of Psychology Malcolm denies that Descartes equivocates on 'think' in the way that Vendler charges. According to Malcolm, 'Descartes was precisely insisting that when we mean by "sensation" something other than mere physio- logical processes, then sensation does have propositional content'. 'Indeed,' Malcolm goes on, 'I suggest that for Descartes the distinction between the "mental" and the "physical" is defined by the presence or absence of propositional content.'18 Construing (on Descartes' behalf) 'to have thoughts' in a narrow way, Malcolm concludes, in our terms, that (4) is simply false. Here is his summary verdict on Descartes: According to my understanding of Descartes, he explicitly and conscious- ly adopted the position that there is a propositional kernel in every feeling, desire, voluntary act, emotion, and sensation. This is why he could hold that his essential nature consists in being a thinking thing ... In my opinion this is an absurdly overintellectualized view of the life of man. It helps us to understand, however, why Descartes thought that animals are automatons. They are devoid of mind, of all consciousness and awareness, of real feeling and sensation, because they do not 'apprehend', 'entertain', 'contemplate', or, in plain language, think of propositions.19 This is, I believe, an apt comment on Descartes. Moreover, the rejection of Argument B it embodies is important, even though, pace both Malcolm and Vendler, we already have ample reason to reject Argument Ai. I turn now to a second line of reasoning in Zeno Vendler's book, Res Cogitans. It goes this way: If, following the hint of etymology (con-scire), consciousness be defined as the totality of one's thoughts (at a given moment), then sensations and feelings do not enter one's consciousness until by noticing or being aware of them one forms or entertains a perceptual judgment. If this is true, then we must agree with Descartes that animals, strictly speaking, cannot be conscious of their sensations and other experiences. This does not mean, however, that we must agree with him in regarding them as mere automata-that is, as having sensations only in the sense of under- going certain physiological changes. For, clearly, in noticing or being aware of our sensations we might not, and by and large do not, notice or are aware of the corresponding physiological changes. People noticed their pains before the rise of physiology. What we notice, therefore, is neither the physiological change, nor, obviously, the act of noticing itself, but something distinct from both.20 18 Malcolm, P. 47. 19 Ibid., pp. 48-49. 20 Vendler, pp. i62-063. 449 29</page><page sequence="14">Gareth B. Matthews This is obviously a highly intellectualistic conception of consciousness. But rather than object on principle to its intellectualism, let us see if one could use such a conception to undermine the Principle of Psychological Continuity. The idea would be that, in the strict and proper sense of 'consciousness', only human animals are capable of consciousness. Even if it were (for some reason yet to be explored) wrong to say with Descartes that non-conscious animals are mere automata, still, being incapable of consciousness they would be incapable of conscious acts, states and functions; that incapacity would seem to falsify the Principle of Psycho- logical Continuity and to impeach the unity of psychology. Vendler wants to restrict consciousness to thoughts with propositional content. Characteristically, a thought will be a thought that p. And the thought that p will be tied to a particular person by some mental state or mental act-by that person's finding out or noticing that (s)he has a pain, that the pain is intense, or whatever. The thing comes in two stages. First, (I3) S has a pain. Then by noticing the pain S may form a perceptual judgment, perhaps about the intensity or location of the pain, but most simply, perhaps, (I4) S notices that (s)he has a pain. Vendler seems to think that (I3) might be true though (14) is false. Many people would deny that such is a real possibility. Perhaps the best thing to say in its favour, with respect to people, anyway, is to note the phenomenon of being distracted or preoccupied. We might think of a philosopher engrossed in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as having a toothache without noticing that (s)he has it. It is unclear to me whether Vendler thinks non-human animals notice pains, as well as have them. Certainly he denies that they can notice that they have them. Thus where 'S' in (I3) and (I 4) is replaced by the name of a dog, say, (13) might be true though (I4) would have to be false. (I4) would have to be false, according to Vendler, for the Cartesian reason that no non-human animal can have the thought that (s)he has a pain and therefore none can notice that (s)he does. Suppose as a physician I have the choice of using an easy, but very painful, operating procedure on a patient or a more difficult, but quite painless, one. One thing that would, presumably, count heavily toward justifying my decision to use the easy, but painful, procedure would be the knowledge that I could administer a drug to the patient that would have the effect that the patient did not notice that (s)he is in pain. But suppose now that my new-born child needs an operation. Two procedures are available, a cheap one and a very expensive one. The chief difference between the procedures, let us suppose, besides their relative cost, is that the cheaper operation is very painful. All sorts of conceivable 450</page><page sequence="15">Animals and the Unity of Psychology considerations might count toward justifying my decision to okay the cheaper, but more painful, procedure. (It might be, for example, that using the additional money to buy the more expensive operation would bring anguish or suffering to someone else.) But one consideration that would not count at all, I think, would be the thought that, since my new-born baby cannot talk, it does not have thoughts and therefore will not notice that it has a pain. Or suppose I have a parallel choice to make concerning my dog. Again, various conceivable considerations might count toward justifying my decision to order the cheaper, but more painful, operation. One such consideration might be that using the money for the more expensive operation would mean depriving my children of adequate food or clothing. But among them would not be the idea that, since my dog cannot talk, she does not have thoughts and therefore will not notice that she is in pain. It might be objected that my reasoning here is illicit. The plea, 'But S will not notice that (s)he is in pain' derives its excusing force, one might say, from its use in contexts in which S is a kind of being quite capable of noticing that (s)he is in pain. Because that is not the case where S is a dog or a new-born baby, the plea has no excusing force. The objection is inadequate. One wants to know in all these cases how much suffering one would be inflicting on innocent creatures. To say that the baby or the dog will have pains, or be in pain, but not notice that it has pains, or is in pain, is to say something of doubtful sense. If it makes any sense at all, it entails that the baby and the dog will not suffer as much as would a patient with similar pains who noticed that (s)he had them. But we have no good reason for saying that the fact that new-born babies and dogs have no language is reason for thinking that they would suffer less than adult human beings with full linguistic capabilities. Therefore it is either false or nonsensical to say that, while, they would indeed have pains, they would not notice that they have them. I might add in passing that there is some evidence that whether a human being or, say, a dog suffers at all in a given kind of situation, or whether it suffers to degree n, may be socially and culturally influenced-in the case of human beings, through language.21 But to say that does not help to make sense of the idea that a being incapable of speech may have pains but will not notice that (s)he has them. In criticizing Vendler's second argument I have introduced the case of an infant human being as the case of something apparently capable of consciousness, yet incapable of using a language. I think it is appropriate to see in the continuous line of development from the fertilized human ovum to the adult human being at least an analogy to the continuum of develop- 21 Cf. Ronald Melzack, The Puzzle of Pain (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973), Chapter 2. 45I</page><page sequence="16">Gareth B. Matthews ment from the lowest forms of plant and animal life up the scale of nature, or up the evolutionary ladder, to homo sapiens. I say 'analogy' deliberately, for there are certainly important respects in which it is not correct to say that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Nevertheless, if someone is willing to attribute psychological states, acts or functions to a human embryo, or even to a new-born infant human being, that that person is not willing to attribute to even the most highly developed adult non-human primate, it is fair to ask what the basis can be for attributing that psychological act, state or function to the human infant or embryo and not to the non-human primate. Certainly Aristotle thought the continuum of human development to be, in important ways, analogous to the continuum exhibited by (not of course the evolutionary development of the human species, since he did not suppose the human species to have evolved but) the scale of nature. In the famous first chapter of Book VIII of the History of Animals, from which I quoted in discussing the Principle of Psychological Continuity at the beginning of this paper, there is this passage: ... in children may be observed the traces and seeds of what will one day be psychological habits, though psychologically a child hardly differs for the time being from an animal . .. (588a33-b2). In a full discussion of these matters one would want to consider a principle of psychological continuity that applies to stages in the develop- ment of a human individual, as well as to stages in the evolutionary development of the species. Just how far back into pre-natal development this principle might apply is a matter for special consideration; it would be obviously relevant to the question of whether, and if so when, and under what circumstances, abortion might be justified. Can I do any better than Vendler and Malcolm in finding good Cartesian reasoning for the conclusion that non-human animals do not think, are not conscious and do not have minds? One line of reasoning to be found in Descartes that is neglected by Vendler and Malcolm deserves some attention, I think. Descartes viewed his arguments for the separateness of mind and body as essential for showing that the mind, unlike the human body, is an immortal thing. Those arguments thus formed an important part of his philosophical theology. Now if brutes thought as we do, Descartes wrote to the Marquess of Newcastle (23 November i646), they would have an immortal soul like us. This is unlikely, because there is no reason to believe it of some animals without believing it of all, and many of them such as oysters and sponges are too imperfect for this to be credible.22 22 Descartes, Letters, p. 2o8. 452</page><page sequence="17">Animals and the Unity of Psychology It is easy to ridicule Descartes' reasoning in this and similar passages. But it is hard to take an honest look at the way you and I want, and maybe need, to be told (as perhaps our religious faith tells us, if we are religious), that each of us is of unique and infinite worth and importance. The traditional doctrine of the immortality of the soul, among several of its psychological and religious functions, promises to give metaphysical foundation to the idea of the unique and everlasting importance of each human individual. If now even a single oyster or sponge also has an immortal psyche, the coin of individual worth is instantly devalued by a massive flooding of the market. The line of reasoning I want to emphasize is, however, rather different from this. It has to do with Descartes' reiterated appeal to speech as 'the only certain sign of thought hidden in a body' and his identification of speech as 'a real specific difference between men and dumb animals'.23 Malcolm and Vendler are right to emphasize its importance for Descartes and for us; but I want to interpret its significance for Descartes in a way different from any they suggest. In an earlier paper called 'Consciousness and Life'24 I suggested that Descartes conceives a mind as a self-transparent thing, and, conversely, a self-transparent thing as a mind-where a self-transparent thing is some- thing such that, if x belongs to it, it cannot doubt that x belongs to it. This notion of something that cannot doubt that its acts and states belong to it is in danger of trivialization if we think of applying it to a thing totally incapable of doubt. If a thing is incapable of doubt altogether, it is also incapable of doubting that it believes this, or seems to see that, or to feel the other. Thus a stone, for example, might be said, ludicrously, to be a mind, on the ground that, being altogether incapable of doubt, it is also such that if x belongs to it, it is incapable of doubting that x belongs to it. In this way the Cartesian concept of mind threatens absurdity, unless we add that, to be a mind a thing must at least be capable of doubting that p. One might think that if we include this requirement the rest becomes superfluous, for only minds are capable of doubt. But r do not think Descartes would have agreed. Persons conceived either as corporeal entities or as mysterious unions of mind and body are capable of doubt. But they are not such that, if x belongs to them, they cannot doubt that x belongs to them. Therefore they are not minds. Descartes nowhere, so far as I know, makes entirely explicit the capacity- for-doubt requirement as a requirement for having or being a mind. But it is well to remember that in both the Meditations and the Discourse he produces his rational reconstruction of knowledge in the first person, making use of the method of systematic doubt. He certifies his own existence, as a mind, through the method of systematic doubt, and it is 23 Letter to More, 5 February i649, Letters, p. 245. 24 Philosophy, 52, No. i99 (January 1977), I3-26. 453</page><page sequence="18">Gareth B. Matthews quite natural that he should think of other minds as entities capable of certifying their own existence in the same way, and hence as entities capable of doubting that p. The central role of the capacity to doubt propositions in Descartes' account of mind and thought may help explain how it is that Descartes should choose the ability to use a language as the sure mark of 'thought hidden in a body'. Though it is quite natural, as I have already tried to suggest, to attribute thinking that p and wanting x to dumb animals, it is much less natural to attribute to them the capacity to doubt that p. The capacity for doubt, like the capacity for hope (cf. Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, Oxford, I953, p. I74) seems to presuppose linguistic competence. If then only beings capable of doubting propositions have a real mental life, no dumb animal has a real mental life. On my reconstruction, then, Descartes' confidence that only human animals are capable of consciousness rests ultimately on the idea that only human beings are capable of doubting propositions and hence only human animals are capable of a self-transparent 'inner' or mental life. Of course this reasoning will not do. At least some non-human animals are capable of suffering pain. In some cases their pain states model pain states in human beings. (That we believe this to be true is shown by certain experimental uses we make of non-human animals to test drugs, food and cosmetics intended eventually for human beings.) If their pain states were not genuine mental states, but only mechanical ones, as Descartes supposes, it would always be inappropriate to feel compassion for the sufferings of non-human animals. But it is not always inappropriate. Therefore it is false that the pain states of non-human animals are not genuinely mental, but only mechanical states. If such animals lack, as I suppose many of them do, the capacity to doubt propositions, then the capacity to doubt propositions is not a prerequisite for having a genuine mental life. My own best effort to reconstruct Cartesian reasoning for the conclusion that non-human animals are non-conscious automata thus yields nothing more persuasive than the efforts of Vendler and Malcolm. I conclude that Descartes has given us no good reason to reject the Principle of Psycho- logical Continuity and no plausible basis for denying the unity of psychology.25 University of Massachusetts, Amherst 25 This article draws on material from two lectures in a series of eight given at Cambridge University in 1976 under the title, 'The Concept of Soul'.
