<plain_text><page sequence="1">278 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) Symposium on Alien Participants: Jackie Byars (Moderator), Jeff Gould, Peter Fitting, Judith Newton, Tony Safford, Clayton Lee Edited by Charles Elkins I The following six papers focus on the SF horror film Alien. All of them exanmine the movie in terms of its ideological implications. For reasons of space and to avoid needless repetition, all of the papers have been edited, some rather drastically. Thus, the authors should not be blamed if their contributions appear rather fragmented; they have most graciously consented to allowing their papers to appear in these truncated forms. -CE] 1. Jackie Byars: Introduction to Some Ideological Readings of Alien The readings of Alien that follow offer several perspectives within the realm of ideological criticism. Remembering Christian Metz's statement that "interwoven into every analytical undertaking is the thread of self-analysis"' and that ideolog- ical analysis is, basically, self-analysis, we try to keep in mind our position as both critics and subjects of this cultural document. The film's plot is simplicity itself. The crew of the Nostromo, a space tugboat for a refinery, is awakened by "Mother," the ship's computer, only to find that they are nowhere near home but are expected to investigate the source of a constant signal from a nearby planet. Upon landing on a strange planet, some damage is done to the ship, occasioning remarks and situations which clarify the class structure of the crew and allow minimal character development of the five men and two women who comprise this mini-society. While they are on the planet, an alien life-form attaches itself to one of the men and finds its way onto the Nostromo. It proceeds to metamor- phose several times, killing at least one crew member at each stage and becom- ing ever more frightening. During this process, we find out that the purpose of the Nostromo's expedition was to return home not with the refined mineral ore but with the monster -and that the Company considers the crew expendable. This news is not taken kindly by third-officer Ripley, the film's female hero, who learns from the ship's science officer (who turns out to be a robot) that the monster's basic nature is to destroy and survive. Realizing that it is she or the monster and surmising that the Company wants the monster for possible profits from weapons development, she proceeds - after searching the ship for Jones, her pet cat - to blow up the ship and escape in a shuttle. Discovering that the monster has hitched a ride in the shuttle, she once more has occasion to do battle. She wins, of course, and settles down to suspended sleep, hoping that she will be picked up once her shuttle "reaches the Frontier." We are not expected to keep up with complicated sub-plots; no romance fogs the purity and simplic- ity of the straight SF/horror plot. Neither are we distracted by complicated character development or sophisticated dialogue. The 2001/Star Wars space glamour is missing, although the monster is quite good and taps into the ideology of the audience in an eerily effective way (as we might expect from a director who is the veteran of several thousand commercials) to create a very scary movie. Why study mass cultural documents? It is through the study of those commodified</page><page sequence="2">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 279 texts such as television shows, films, and popular novels that we come to understand the assumptions and processes of contemporary American ideolo- gy. Examinations of high culture - however personally satisfying, academically fruitful, or even politically valuable - will not yield the same insight into Ameri- can ideology that we can acquire through rigorous analysis of the documents that are consumed by the majority of Americans. This insight is particularly important for critics who want to learn how it is that people come to believe that certain things are "real" and "natural." While it is far too simple to say that these documents reflect reality, it is relatively safe to say that they are articulations of ideology. Through careful examination of the discourse that presents and represents "reality," we can more adequately think critically about this process. This is not a simple task; Tim Patterson writes: Bourgeois hegemony results in a systematic misrepresentation of reality, the distor- tion or suppression of information, the creation of illusions - all both in the form of ideas and in the form of institutions - which undermine and pacify the conscious- ness of the proletariat .... The hegemonic distortion of reality is much more exten- sive, subtle, and sophisticated in contemporary American capitalism than might reasonably have been envisaged by 19th century socialist thinkers.2 Ideology, through the institutions that Louis Althusser calls Ideological State Apparatuses (ISAs),3 distorts reality and attempts to appropriate culture to nature, and the culture and communications apparatus are instrumental in this process. Why, specifically, study Hollywood movies? When film first became intellec- tually (and academically) respectable, it was because it was christened "Art" with a capital A, but "Art" was not produced in Hollywood; it came from Sweden, France, Italy, perhaps Germany, and certainly Japan, from such direc- tors as Bergman, Antonioni, Truffaut, Fellini, and Kurosawa. Just after World War II, the French began to do serious work on Hollywood cinema; they were the first. Their approach, which came to be known as auteur criticism, was widely misunderstood by Americans.4 Like much criticism of high art, auteur criticism, which is director-centered, focuses on the creative subject,, a risky undertaking in such a collaborative form as film. While auteur criticism falls into certain idealistic biases that any critique of ideology would necessarily deny, its practitioners did bring attention to a group of texts previously ignored by bourgeois high-art critics, and in recent years critics of ideology have begun to look more closely at these texts, realizing that they are of crucial importance in the ideological process. Why, then, choose Alien for the topic of a public discussion? Alien is what is known as a "blockbuster." Blockbusters, a relatively recent phenomenon in the film industry, are "packaged." Their pre-release publicity is not only in the form of "trailers" (previews in movie theatres) but in TV, radio, newspaper, and magazine ads. They are simultaneously released across the country, and they depend on a repeat audience: many people will see Alien two, three, or four times. It may be re-released in two years, so that its fans can see it again, and so those unfortunates who missed it the first time around can have the chance to see it. And these people will pay full price each time they see it. Finally, how should Marxists approach ideological readings of mass cultural documents? It is important to distinguish between two kinds of readings, and it is important to perform them both: we must see cultural documents in their industrial environment as well as in their cultural context. We must examine not only the ways in which a document internalizes and transmits ideology, we must</page><page sequence="3">280 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) examine the transmission of that document. I will situate Alien within the environment of the film industry, and Jeff Gould, in his reading, examines the nature of the document as a commodity under consumer capitalism. Writing about the function of the Marxist historian, Walter Benjamin said: There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism. And just as such a document is not free of barbarism, barbarism taints also the manner in which it was transmitted from one owner to another. A historical materialist dissociates himself from it as far as possible. He regards it as his task to brush history against the grain.' In our examinations of cultural documents, we are tempted to focus attention on the documents themselves and the ways in which they distort reality, rather than on their transmission. Analysis of this transmission may be, as Benjamin sug- gests, as important as analysis of the documents, and a complete reading must include some consideration of the conditions of transmission. Peter Fitting, in his reading of Alien, pursues another fruitful path by situat- ing this film within the SF/horror genre. Many of the critics and reviewers of Alien have commented on the purgative, cathartic effect of such horror films, focusing on either their appeal to the unconscious or their political function as absorbers of anger and frustration.6 Films allow us to believe that we have been purified; they seduce us, but the seduction is safe. They allow us to risk, but the risk is secure and therefore no risk at all. The cinema, Christian Metz writes, .... represents a kind of enclosure or 'reserve' which escapes a fully social life although it is accepted and prescribed by it: going to the cinema is one licit activity among others with its place in the admissible pastimes of the day or the week, and yet that place is a 'hole' in the social cloth, a loophole opening on to something slightly less approved than what one does the rest of the time.7 Like the cathartic purification attributed to classical tragedy, the trauma of sin in the darkness of a movie theater is safe. Forgiveness is automatic, but we are allowed, for a short while, to live those things we fear, to displace our anxieties and make them, too, safe. Judith Newton's reading of Alien examines how this film displaces contemporary anxieties about sexuality, the women's movement, and housework, allowing the audience to feel comfortable with the presence of women in the capitalist order. SF/horror films allow us, Susan Sontag suggests, to "participate in the fantasy of living one's own death and more the death of cities, the destruction of humanity itself."8 She insists that the function of these fantasies is to allow people to cope simultaneously with the unremitting banality of life and the inconceivable terror of death. A film like Alien temporarily removes us from the security of our daily existence by disorienting us. The early tracking shots take us through the corridors of the Nostromo, encouraging us to believe that we may learn our way around the ship, but we never do feel comfortable with its geography. The blurring of words and the overwhelming Dolby stereo create auditory disorientation. The many unanswered questions about the world from which the crew comes, about the planet on which they land, and about the nature of the monster - to mention a few - create intellectual disorientation. But by the end of the film we are convinced of resolution; we have experienced another "happy ending." Saved by individual action, the human race has sur- vived yet another threat of annihilation. Many questions remain unanswered - among them: is the monster really dead? - but we have, nevertheless, a sense of an ending.</page><page sequence="4">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 281 Both Tony Safford and Clayton Lee address the problem of Alien's ending. Safford analyzes the tension between science and humanism, focusing on one of the film's elements -the cat. Reading the cat as a "sliding signifier," Safford looks to find ideology at work in its slide. Its final anchoring, which restores domesticity, is shaky and (perhaps inadvertently) allows significant misreadings. In terms usually reserved for the critique of high art, Lee compares Renaissance and Mannerist uses of visual and spatial elements, suggesting that Alien is a Mannerist version of 2001, that it distorts the Renaissance sense of space. He also traces the monster's evolution from a bimorphic to an anthropomorphic creature. As most of the following readings will examine the document's embodiment and transmission of ideology, I would like to first make a few comments about Alien's position within the environment of the film industry. As capitalism entered the stage we now call "late monopoly capitalism" or "consumer capital- ism" following World War II, the studio system of film production entered its twilight years (the 1950s) and then died. Old Hollywood, under the studio system, produced incredible numbers of films quickly and, compared to today's films, cheaply. The US cinema during this period (roughly, 1930 to 1960) homogenized US culture much as television now does. Few movies stood out from the crowd as clearly better than the rest, as few TV shows now stand out as superior. Studios had stables of writers, directors, and actors under contract and could crank out even a good "A" movie in 30 to 90 days for $500,000 to $1,500,000 and a lower-budgeted "B" movie in 3 to 14 days for $30,000 to $150,000. The production of films resembled the factory production of enter- tainment that we now associate with network television, and the transmission of these cultural documents was controlled by the same studios that produced them. Five vertically integrated studio systems- MGM, RKO, Warner Brothers, Paramount, and Twentieth Century Fox - controlled not only most of the film production in the US but distribution and exhibition as well. Many theaters, especially the large theaters in the major cities, were owned by the "majors," and those that were not were controlled by their distribution systems. In order for independent theater owners to acquire films, they frequently had to agree to take the bulk of a studio's productions; for instance, in order to get a good "A" movie, an independent theater owner would have to agree to take several "B" movies with it. "Blind booking," the booking of unfinished films, was not uncommon in this situation, and the independents were at the mercy of the studios. Most theaters changed their double bills (one "A" movie and one "B" movie) three times a week, and their audiences saw most of the movies. People saw a movie once, not two, three or more times as they do now. Most movies made some money; of 400 to 700 movies released annually, 80% made money, but few were overwhelmingly successful. Until the early '60s, only a handful of movies had ever made over $5 million. In contrast, we now have movies like Alien, costing $10 million to make and depending on a repeat crowd to bring Twentieth Century Fox a projected 80% profit. Blockbusters were not relevant to the economics of the studio system; they are crucial to the New Hollywood. Big-hype Hollywood movies often cost as much as $20-30 million and rarely less than $3-4 million to produce. Cast and crew are assembled anew for each production and a film may take a year to a year and a half to complete. They are usually made and produced by independ- ent entrepreneurs, although financial backing is rarely acquired without a prior</page><page sequence="5">282 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) distribution agreement with a major studio. In effect, the studios still control the industry. Only a small number of films make money, and fewer ever make it big, becoming blockbusters like Alien. Because of the industrial base of the studio system, the quality of individual films was less significant, if not irrelevant, than it is now, and many were hopeful that the demise of the studio system would result in a rise in the quality of films produced. Many, if not most, of the films made under the studio system were formulaic and unimaginative, and critics hoped films would be liberated from this factory-like transmission of entertainment. To an extent, this has happened. Some movies are clearly better than others; however, Hollywood's ideological function has changed little, and genre movies continue to be successful. Their incarnations change; the genres seem to regenerate, to renegotiate their con- tracts with their audience. While they are topical, they remain traditional. Alien's plot is traditional for the SF/horror genre, but its concerns are contemporary - it focuses on feminism, anti-institutional individualism, ecolo- gy, and technology -and its success may be attributable to this combination. 2. Jeff Gould: The Destruction of the Social by the Organic in Alien Returning from a source of raw materials (the galactic equivalent of the Third World?), a spaceship and its crew encounter an especially nasty specimen of alien life. The conditions of this encounter are carefully established. In a slight inflection of the terms of the genre, the scenario abandons the conventional pretense of military or scientific exploration. We are given instead a "commer- cial towing vessel," looking plausibly like a flying factory. The microsociety of the crew, from which no personality detaches itself in sufficiently decisive fashion to observe the collective character of the enter- prise, is mapped in great detail. There is a division of labor among executive, technical, and laboring functions, and to this division corresponds the inevitable supplement of economic inequality (not all the crew members have equal shares) and hierarchical prejudice. Ripley, for example, an officer, evidently despises the engine-room workers, to whom she refers as "motherfuckers." Cigarettes, what appears to be beer in suitably labeled cans, little knick-knacks like dipping plastic ducks on the breakfast table, all serve to suggest not simply the galactic destiny of corporate capitalism, but the persistence, in time and space, of its most characteristic aesthetic form: consumer goods. Thus is founded by visual signals the principle of economic competition (for which all consumer goods serve as pretext) that will prove to be the underlying form of biological life itself. This microcosmic class society is engaged in a microcosmic class struggle of its own, where the working class - in the persons of the bad-talking-but-noble- black, Parker, and his best buddy, the semi-articulate, white, ethnic pin-up collector, Brett- periodically threatens to go on strike, displays incorrigible greed, and appears to distrust the duly established authority of its superiors. The roots of this division are explicitly referred to the crew's contractual relation with the "Company." Omniscient (knowing about the alien in advance and taking the precaution of planting one of its agents on board), sinister (having military as well as commercial interests), and ruthless (decreeing its employees expendable), the Company is the unique representative of an outside social order whose invisible lines of force can neither be crossed nor counteracted. Within these lines of force, and at an inaccessible remove from the center of the field, is suspended the minute particle of habitable space deemed functionally</page><page sequence="6">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 283 necessary for the economic subject. The ship presents the final union of the technologically sophisticated workplace (only minimally subject to the control of its human operators) and the privatized void of a modem suburb, in this film reduced to the individual in suspended animation cells that render properly obsolete the distraction of television or mass-market films. The extended exposition of the film establishes what we may designate the pre-packaged raw material of the film. What follows will be a rarely more-than- mechanical elaboration of suspense and fulfillment, interesting for the modifi- cations worked in its initial material. Into this closed and exemplary society, transformation will enter in the guise of a noxious visitor. The Alien is described by the android science officer, who ought to know, as the "perfect organism." Self-replicating, it can adapt to any environment, rec- ognizes no morality (a distinct plus in the android's view), participates in no social order, and is, of course, implacably hostile. It is in all respects a superior product of competitive evolution and resembles nothing so much as that other superorganism, itself victor in an evolutionary struggle: the multinational (soon to be interstellar) corporation. In the system of the narrative, the Alien is the double, we might say the biological analogue, of the Company. If the Alien waits in the wreckage of some unnoticed catastrophe, the Company, poking into novelty, will send someone to get it. If Ripley tries to keep it out of the ship, the Company, acting through its android agent, will let it in; if the Company regards the crew as expendable, the Alien, following its instincts, will put this implicit judgment into effect. If, finally, the Company installs class division among the crew, exercising its authority from a distance through the force of hierarchy, it is the Alien, along for the ride, that will undermine the ability of the group to act or preserve itself as a group. No collective strategy depending on successful coop- eration among individuals will work against it. When it is eventually harpooned, vacuumed, and blasted to death, the triumph will be the work of an individual, the last one cashing in her superior ingenuity and persistence against the exclusively personal benefit of survival. Taking the double Alien/Company (designated biological competition/economic competition) as our base pair we can represent the ideological "infrastructure" of the narrative as follows: economic functional com petition hierarchy class profit resistance v breakdown of \biological group competition survival individual performance</page><page sequence="7">284 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) Power in class society group company individual organic horror Survival of the fittest A latent, inherently unstable political dynamic shifts into a more elemental order of pure organic horror, where strobe lights flash on mutilated corpses, and the very loathsome visage of the Alien renders the notions of hierarchy and contractual obligation as superfluous as the class resistance they were intended to efface. The perfectly mediocre plotting of Alien does not endanger the verisimilitude of this transition. The network of relations given in the schema is only the minimum set of significant oppositions required to motivate the pri- mary effect of the narrative, the delivery of the little packets of shock-and- disgust the audience has paid for. Like the shattered crystalline structures of fatigued metal, the signifying material of the commodity-narrative does not form, or can no longer form, a closed semiotic system. Thus the different stages of the Alien's life cycle are capable of bearing essentially unrelated significations, united only in their common evocation of the organic. The egg stage, curious for the absence of a hard, outer surface, suggests the peeling away of skin as in surgery to reveal, across an oozing, veined membrane, the unsought secret of some squirming horror. The hand-like entity that attaches itself to an astronaut's face, however, calls up very different associations of strangulation (the tentacle tightening around the neck) and suffocation (the face is completely covered). Or again, the worm-like, parasitical larva, burrowing undetected within the body, alternately mimics the symptoms of cancer and heart attack before its victim, in a grotesque parody of regurgita- tion (and possibly childbirth), is abruptly eviscerated at the breakfast table. What is at stake in these assorted nightmares (to which we could add the decapitation of the science officer/robot and the adult form of the Alien itself) is a revulsion aroused, not by the presence of death, but by the organic as such.</page><page sequence="8">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 285 The images of unsuspected disease and shocking mutilation can be made to serve as a focal point for a host of other, more carefully managed fears. So it is that the disparate and partial signifying elements engaged in the successive visions of the Alien, collapsed into a single bundle of organic horror, can effortlessly displace the fiction of a representative image of the contemporary social order. 3. Peter Fitting: The Second Alien In the following discussion, I will attempt to set out the situation and functions of the film Alien as an ideological practice which reproduces in the spectator a particular understanding of the real and of his or her place in that reality. In other terms, analogous to the work of the dream (and its subsequent decoding and analysis), cultural artifacts seek to resolve in an imaginary way, through the work itself, real conflicts and contradictions. Like the unconscious, ideology conceals and obscures real conflicts; and art, like the dream, becomes the privileged place in which this unconscious expresses and manifests itself, albeit in a displaced and covert fashion which it is the critic's task to unravel and disclose. Popular narrative forms - here specifically the SF-horror film - function through the displacement of authentic fears and anxieties generated by the contradictions of contemporary life under capitalism onto the source of the terror and suspense proposed by the film. Like the images of a dream which disturb us without our understanding why, the monster becomes a coded figura- tion of what we imagine to be the source of our problems and anxieties. The central conflict of Alien, the immediate source of the spectator's tension and anxiety, lies with the fate of the crew of the space-freighter Nostromo and the terror and death they undergo. The first threat to them is, of course, the alien monster which stalks and kills them after they have brought it on board. But there is a secondary threat in the betrayal of the machines -Ash, the android science officer and Mother, the computer -who are programmed to act in the unnamed Company's best interests, even at the expense of the crew. Alien builds on and develops three of the major trends of the SF film. First it is an SF monster film, a genre which characterizes the SF film boom of the 1950s. Secondly, Alien uses the theme of robots and computers, which also has an important literary and filmic history, but which is most prevalent in the movies made in the late '60s and early '70s. Finally, Alien is very much a part of the most recent trend toward big-budget SF films in which special effects predominate. The first wave of SF monster films begins with the "Creature Cycle" of the 1950s -with films in which the earlier monsters of folklore and fiction (were- wolves, Frankenstein, etc.) and particularly the prehistoric monsters of various "lost worlds" (a title borrowed from the Conan Doyle novel and filmed at least twice - in 1925 and 1960; see also the first King Kong or the five versions of Jules Verne's Mysterious Island), are renewed and transformed through the impact of the atomic bomb. From primordial, chthonic creatures awakened from the depths (as in The Beast from 20, 000 Fathoms [ 19531 and Honda's films in Japan, beginning with Godzilla, 1955) to the monstrous mutations produced by atomic tests (beginning with the giant ants of Douglas' Them, 1954), this genre degener- ates into the low-budget formula films of the "giant insect cycle": The Black Scorpion, Tarantula, Attack of the Giant Leeches, The Deadly Mantis, Earth vs. the Giant Spider, etc.9 The 1950s also witnessed a wave of alien monster and alien invasion films which illustrate a number of themes suggestive for a reading of Alien. Some films present a single alien: it is almost always hostile and frequently preys on</page><page sequence="9">286 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) humans, as in Nyby's The Thing (1951), one of the first and probably the best of the '50s' SF monster movies and the most evident antecedent for Ridley Scott's Alien. 10 In The Thing, a group of men is pitted against a vicious, predatory alien which, in a masterpiece of pacing and suspense, stalks and kills them within the enclosed space of a small military base. Like Alien, The Thing begins with the investigation of an alien space-craft - a UFO which has crashed near the North Pole -and with the recovery of what is thought to be the corpse of an alien frozen in ice. The alien accidentally thaws out and escapes into the Arctic night, returning to attack and kill. As in Alien, the film's suspense and terror come from the monster's ability to hide and from the group's attempts to find and destroy it. As in Alien, there is a crucial scene in which the men watch a geiger counter slowly come to life and begin to beep faster and faster as the unseen monster approaches and then bursts into the room where it is, at least in the first film, then burned and destroyed. Other significant resemblances include refer- ences in both films to the alien's amazing adaptability and ability to survive and reproduce, and the term "perfect organism" is used in both movies. In both also there are images of the monster's biological stages and each sets out to repro- duce itself. There are also significant differences. The Thing, although it is described as a plant (actually a carrot!) is intelligent; the monster of Alien is not. Moreover, the defeat of the Thing is a victory for a familiar Hawksian practical- ity and tough-mindedness as well as the victory of a group over an attacking enemy. The crew of the Nostromo, on the other hand, is eliminated one by one, despite all their group efforts, until Ripley single-handedly defeats the monster. The mutated insects and awakened monsters of the first group of '50s' movies may be seen as mirroring contemporary anxieties about, as Susan Sontag put it, living under the threat of "something almost insupportable psychologically - collective incineration and extinction which could come at any time, virtually without warning."11 The first type of alien film, on the other hand -with its vicious and predatory alien - seems to evoke a deeper and more archaic kind of terror which is similar to the fears and anxieties exploited by the contemporary horror film. In the horror film, in Robin Wood's Freudian formulation, the monster figures as the repressed psyche of late capitalism: first of all, the sexually repressed, the deviations from the norm of capitalist patriarchy; but also the excluded others of our society who are perceived as threatening - homosexuals and non-whites, workers and foreigners.42 In the SF film repression is itself a theme, particularly in terms of the supposed opposition between the human and animal sides of "human nature." This opposition may be seen in the SF film as early as 1932 in The Island of Lost Souls (from H. G. Wells's the Island of Doctor Moreau, remade in 1977). In the context of the SF film boom of the 1950s, the most striking and explicit reformulation of this dualistic legitimization of repression is the film Forbidden Planet (1956), in which, on the abandoned alien world of Altair IV, two marooned humans live among the still-functioning machines of the vanished Krel. Vast alien machines designed to transform and concretize wishes and desires allow Dr Morbius, while he is asleep, to unknowingly summon a "monster from the Id" to attack the Earthmen who have arrived to rescue Morbius and his daughter. Morbius finally realizes what he is doing when the invisible monster attacks his own house to prevent Morbius' daughter from leaving with the ship and the commander with whom she has fallen in love. Society's need for the control and repression of instinctual drives is represented through the filmic tradition of juxtaposing white European Civilization with the barbarism and savagery of the world's non-white peoples and cultures. It can be</page><page sequence="10">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 287 seen in the portrayals of our own native peoples in the US Western or in the older accounts of different civilizing missions to Africa, Asia, and the Americas as well as in recent films which deal with the war in Vietnam and the innate savagery of the Vietnamese people (including The Deerhunter and Apocalypse Now). In the SF film, this racist sub-text is an important part of the significance of aliens. They either resemble insects, animals, etc., so that their bestial nature is inscribed in their very appearance; or, in the case of humanoid aliens, they are frequently not white, as is the case for the popular Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the blond, fairskinned Flash is pitted against the Asiatic Ming the Merciless. There is, then, an important distinction in the functioning and significance of the alien in the SF film, from the elemental or archaic biological terror which is invoked in the portrayal of the single alien to the more complex social fears inscribed in the alien as a group or collectivity. The model of this second type of SF film, which also flourished during the boom of the 1950s, is the invasion in its many manifestations. The best example of this type of film is perhaps the 1953 version of H. G. Wells's The War of the Worlds. Made during the Korean War, this film shows the Martian invasion of Southern California (as opposed to the tranquil English countryside of Wells's novel). Although the Martians them- selves are only rarely glimpsed, the advance of their invulnerable war machines and the scenes of the evacuation of Los Angeles were understood by many in terms of the "yellow hordes" reportedly pouring into South Korea and in terms of the "Communist menace" in general - particularly because of a scene in which a news commentator reports on the many struggles going on throughout the world against the Martian invaders. While many of the invasions from outer space were seen and understood in terms of the explicit political realities of the period, other SF films seemed to deal with an even more frightening aspect of the Communist threat - the insidious and seemingly undetectable presence among us of Communist agents. The classic instance of this fear was Don Siegel's Invasion of The Body Snatchers (1956, remade in 1978), where a small-town doctor in Northern California discovers that his patients and friends are being replaced by simulacra. Here the struggle against the invaders is almost secondary to the task of detecting the aliens. This film is an allegory for the McCarthy period and the difficulties encountered in uncovering the Communists at work in our midst - a difficulty which was summed up in the film I Married a Monsterfrom Outer Space (1958), where the wife's horrifying discovery of the true identity of her husband parallels the wife's discovery in I Married a Communist (1949). Thus far I have tried to situate the monster of Alien in terms of the portrayal of aliens in the SF movies of the 1950s. In these terms, the threat which the monster seemed to represent has both an individual and a social significance. Whereas the individual alien evoked an archaic, biological terror, this fear was further developed in the invasion films to suggest a political menace as well. Again the differences between The Thing and Alien are suggestive, for these are differences not only in the possible meanings of the alien, but in the groups themselves. In Hawks's film, the group includes civilians and scientists, but it is primarily a military organization. The crew of the Nostromo is a smaller and more heterogeneous group, made up of employees of the Company which owns the ship. Unlike the white men who confront the Thing, this crew of seven includes two women and one black. And in this sense, the crew might be said to pose, in miniature, the model for an enlightened and progressive capitalism which has been able to integrate into it blacks and women - two groups whose</page><page sequence="11">288 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) struggles for emancipation and equality have intensified the internal crisis of bourgeois democracy. But there is also a difference in what binds the two groups together: in The Thing it is a common ideal - Science for the scientists, Patriot- ism for the soldiers; but the crew of Nostromo is there for the money, a topic which is discussed on several occasions in the film. Moreover, in distinction from the older stereotype of wage slavery, the Nostromo represents an advanced "participatory" capitalism where the workers share directly in the company's profits. But if the crew of the Nostromo is seen as a microcosm of society, it must be remembered that the Alien is not the only threat. The android, Ash, and the computer, Mother, also menace the lives of the human crew insofar as these machines are programmed to effect the capture of the Alien, even at the cost of the humans on board. The presence and importance of these machines refer us to a second wave of SF films. The SF films of the late 1960s and early '70s deal less with aliens and alien invasions and are more explicitly preoccupied with visions of the future of the social order, a preoccupation which corresponds to the concerns and crises of the US in the 1960s. The image of a future Earth in which computers manage global affairs while humans are free to work and grow was described positively in the concluding stories of Isaac Asimov's I, Robot (1950). But this technologi- cal optimism soon disappeared in the films of the 1960s. It was replaced by dire warnings about the future in which the individual's freedom has been subjected to the impersonal and inhuman reason of the computer. The most significant and best known of these films of oppressive, computer-run societies - whose sub-text is the stereotyped image of government control and regimentation in the socialist countries-include Godard's Alphaville (1965), Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970), THX 1138 (1971), and Logan's Run (1976).'3 The threat of the Alien takes, then, its meaning from the context of two filmic traditions: the monster in the horror film as the return and revenge of the repressed psyche, on the one hand; and on the other - from the filmic legitimizations of the imperialist exploitation and expropriation -the portrayal of the world's non-white peoples and cultures as ignorant and barbaric savages. In similar fashion, there is a contextual dimension for the threat represented by the thinking machines of Alien. For, apart from a brief moment when these themes symbolized progress through technology, the robot and the computer are gen- erally associated today with an increasing sense of alienation and loss of free- doms. In this way, the actual commodification and alienating effects of late capitalism are obscured and given other explanations and causes. Capitalism presents itself as the political will of free individuals, in opposition to socialism and communism, under which, or so our civics textbooks tell us, the individual is subject and secondary to the needs and will of the state. The dystopias of 20th- century Anglo-American SF are almost always written in terms of the suppres- sion of the individual -a suppression which is frequently figured through the mechanization of life and, more recently, through the images of computers and of computer surveillance and control of human behavior. In these terms, the Nostromo and its crew suggest the US's own current self-image. The Nostromo is a threatened ship, an image reminiscent of the current vogue of the pseudo-scientific "Lifeboat Ethics" of Garrett Hardin. According to this theory, in a world faced with over-population, pollution, and the imminent exhaustion of our non-renewable resources, the industrialized capitalist world, and most particularly the US, must not make the mistake of trying to save the rest of the world. According to Hardin, the US is like a lifeboat</page><page sequence="12">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 289 with only so much room and limited resources -a lifeboat which will itself be lost if we attempt to rescue any more of the world's dispossessed and starving peoples. (This argument, like the present indignation over the plight of the "boat people," conveniently overlooks the US role in the creation of the problem.) In this way, the Alien of the film is able to stand in for and symbolize, in a displaced fashion, our fear of the Third World, whose suffering and poverty is an integral part of our own comfort and satisfaction. And if the biological and instinctive "animal" characteristics of the Alien were not enough to suggest such a reading, the term alien is itself indicative. For in everyday linguistic practice alien refers not to beings from outer space, but to "citizens of a foreign state." It does not refer to the European visitor, but as the most familiar contemporary use of the term indicates, to those other, undesirable foreigners -the "illegal aliens." Ripley's triumph over the alien thus is a victory for some new and enlightened capitalism, as well as the resolution of the spectator's fears and anxieties by means of a redefinition of the problems which threaten it. Her singlehanded victory reaffirms the individualistic ideology of capitalism while positing the successful integration into capitalism of a powerful force for social change - feminism -which today threatens its continued smooth functioning. But this filmic displacement and resolution of the spectator's confused and mystified anxieties is an illusory one. For the real victor is the nameless company which owns the ship and which is directly responsible for all the threats and dangers that the crew must face. This responsibility belies the harmonious resolution of a triumphant and progressive capitalism and leads us back to the very contradic- tions the film, as ideological practice, sought to dispel. In sum, both the ravages of the monster and the betrayal of human lives by the machines were the result of simple business decisions. The film's resolution -the defeat of the monster - which apparently reaffirms capitalism's defense of the human, as it has been defined in opposition to the savage voraciousness of the Third World and to the "suppression of the individual" under a Socialist alternative, is in fact incidental, an accidental by-product of the production of profit. Nor does the film criticize the Company. It ends, rather, on a note of calm resolution: the spectator's emotions at that point would seem to be keyed to Ripley's own relief and calm and to her dutiful preparation of a report for the Company. Normality has been threatened and has emerged triumphant; the spectator's authentic anxieties about the existing social order have been dispelled through the fantasy identifi- cation and resolution of the problem - a fantasy solution in which the victims of US imperialism are identified, in this displaced and coded fashion, as themselves the source of our problems. Thus far I have attempted to read Alien as an example of the popular film which uses the fascination and appeal of two film subgenres - SF and horror - to manage and resolve collective fears and anxieties. This is done by situating the alien monster of this film within the context of the SF film and within the filmic tradition of the racist coding of non-white characters and cultures and by distinguishing between the more fundamental and primal biological terror of the horror film (which seems to envision more specifically "psychological" forms and areas of repression -particularly sex and sexual norms) and the SF film's preoccupation with more explicit fears about threats to the social order itself. In this way, I have argued that the crew of the Nostromo might be seen as the model for a renewed and enlightened capitalism, while the Alien suggests the threats which an increasingly militant Third World is seen as posing. The secondary threat of the Nostromo's machines - Ash and Mother - are then images of the stereotyped fears of the inhuman subjection and control of a socialist world.</page><page sequence="13">290 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) What remains to be explained in any such reading of a film is the spectator's own repeated need for such imaginary resolutions. If popular movies simply manipulate their audience, reiterating again and again variations of a single message - the experience of capitalism as both desirable and able to defeat its enemies -why do we need to keep on hearing that message repeated?14 These films surely correspond to real needs, and the repetition has to do with their simultaneous promise of an end to and a resolution of our anxieties and sense of alienation, and with their inability to do so. We return to these types of movies because capitalism is in crisis, because we are frustrated and repressed and very often exploited and oppressed. These films attract us because in their very defense and reaffirmation of capitalism they lure and entice us with glimpses of alternatives which are subsequently denied and repudiated, but which remain the portents of a world of freedom in which the conflicts and exploitation of class society will no longer exist. If the hopes for a different and more humane future implied in the composi- tion and profit-sharing arrangements of the crew of the Nostromo are in effect contradicted by the film's ending, there is another, even more crucial utopian theme which is raised and then denied in Alien. The utopian possibilities of advanced technology and the deliberate foreclosing of those possibilities are perhaps what best characterizes the last and most recent wave of SF films. For the big-budget spectaculars, with those special effects by which they conspicuously consume useless technology (a characteristic also of the James Bond films), reject and repudiate one of SF's original starting points - the linking of technol- ogy and technological advance with the possibility of social transformation. Star Wars (1977), to begin with the most famous and most successful of these films, is in reality anti-SF. Made with all the features of SF -spaceships, other worlds, robots and aliens, and an awesome array of advanced technology, the film uses these elements to efface and deny the utopian possibilities inherent in such impressive technical and technological developments. There is instead a blocking off of any alternatives. First, stated right from the film's opening, the story is set "a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away." Second, the film attempts to avoid any specific comparison with or reference to contemporary reality by omitting all of the principal actors in today's struggles: although there is war and even the destruction of an entire inhabited world, there are no peoples struggling for liberation, no working people, no blacks (although there are a variety of aliens in various supporting and minor roles), no homosexuals, and no women outside the most stereotyped and sexist roles. Foregoing even the most simplistic "psychological" explanations of the sources of human behavior and conflict, in a way very similar to the recent film of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (the first half of the trilogy was released as an animated feature in 1978), Star Wars mystifies real conflicts and their causes by presenting the film's conflicts as part of a universal and eternal struggle between the forces of Good and the forces of Evil. Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1978), the other major big-budget/special effects SF film of the late '70s,"5 takes as its model not Tolkien but Arthur C. Clarke (and von Daniken) and Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). This earlier film, which began the trend towards big budgets and lavish special effects, presents a three-step account of human history: a pre-human phase, the human epoch, and a third, post-human (spiritual) transfiguration. But this evolution is not presented as the gradual emergence and growth of the human; it is rather a transformation effected by an outside agency.'6 According to this Christian accommodation to evolutionary theory, humans have indeed evolved physically from "lower" forms; however, their intelligence, their Soul, is the</page><page sequence="14">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 291 result of a specific, extrinsic intervention (which is depicted in the film by the appearance of the "slab"). Close Encounters renews this metaphysical rewriting of human history by focusing on our contemporary sense of anxiety and aliena- tion and then offering a religious solution. The answers to our current troubles and dilemmas do not lie in human activity or understanding, the film tells us, but outside and beyond us, in the heavens. The possibility or desirability of social transformation is eschewed in favor of sentimental and teary-eyed scenes of religious expectation and enlightenment. The deflection of Close Encounters implicit critique of consumer society, from the liberating potential of the visitors' advanced technology to a mystical solution from above, is a disheartening return to irrationalism and ignorance. Yet despite the obscurantism of real alternatives in these films, there is nonethe- less a utopian dimension which can be detected through the application of a device similar to the electronic scanner which the crew of the Nostromo uses to locate the monster. The scanner I am thinking of is Greimas' semantic rectangle,'7 which permits a mapping of the possibilities and permutations of the original opposition I have noted in Alien between the animal and the human. In addition to the human crew of the Nostromo, we have noted the presence of at least one animal - the cat - as well as the various machines and mechanical devices which, at least in the case of the android Ash, constitute another life form. And there are alien life forms as well, which range from the plant-like eggs in the hold of the alien ship to the monster's vaguely human adult form. Using Greimas' rec- tangle, these differing forms can be represented in a first schema (where - expresses opposition and -*-o- contradiction): Human (H) (-H) Animal (Neither Human nor Animal) Machines (-H) (H) Alien Life Forms (Non-H uman) This first elementary semantic field becomes suggestive as the basic terms generate syntheses which lead to the three principal actors in the film. Ripley, the film's final victor, represents the synthesis of the human and the animal: not only in her designation as the owner of the cat and in the familiar (sexist) coding of female sexuality in terms of the feline and more generally in terms of the instinctive, but more importantly, in terms of her single-handed victory as the return to an earlier Social-Darwinistic model of the survival of the fittest. In our discussion of the alien monster we have frequently referred to the monster's instinctive drive, which stood in opposition to the hesitation and larger consid- erations and emotions of the human crew. In this sense, the alien monster represents the synthesis of the animal and the non-human. And the synthesis of the human and the machine would be the android, Ash, who was the Alien's principal ally as well as Ripley's chief antagonist among the crew members.</page><page sequence="15">292 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) RIPLEY (Human) H ,- - -H (Animal) Ash , Alien (Machine) - " , H (Alien Life Forms) The fourth term, the synthesis of the machine and the non-human, is missing. Like the utopian dimension itself in Alien, it has been suppressed and concealed. The discovery and exploration of the derelict spaceship reveals an important fact which is never again mentioned in the film: that there are in fact two alien races. There is, of course, the race of instinctive monsters whose eggs have stood waiting in the hold for some new host. There is also the race which built the spaceship - a race whose appearance we can only guess at based on the fossilized remains seated at something resembling a telescope (or an anti-aircraft gun), with a gaping hole in its thorax, like the hole the monster makes when it bursts from Kane's chest later in the film. Unlike the alien monsters, this race is intelligent, and even compassionate, for they have set up a beacon to warn other spacecraft away (a fact which Ripley discovers too late when she decodes what Ash had said was an SOS). But this suppressed fourth term is not simply the other alien, for what is most impressive about the other alien is its absence. This absence marks the place of the missing fourth term - the synthesis of the machine and the non-human - in a very precise way. For the alien ship is clearly an artifact, a machine, and yet it appears to be somehow organic. Its organic qualities are even more evident in the book of stills and artists' conceptions and drawings which has just been published (Alien, 1979) and in the novelization of the film by Alan Dean Foster. As Dallas, Kane, and Lambert approach the colossal, horseshoe-shaped craft, it seemed to them as if the spaceship had been grown rather than manufactured. The film recounts, then, the passage from the instinctive to the "human" and the devastating effects of this repressive transformation of the life instincts under capitalism. But Alien is also a reflection on the theme of collectivity and what binds differing interests and competing individuals together in a system of social relations based on inequality and exploitation, particularly when that system is threatened and under attack. The older "glue" was exemplified in The Thing, in which the collective struggle against the Thing typified an older sense of common values and goals - the ideology of Americanism - which today has lost its cohesive, moral force and has been replaced by the ideology of consumerism. The new capitalism implicit in the motives and actions of the crew of the Nostromo holds these men and women together by direct material incentives - a share in the profits. Nor are there any personal human relations in evidence among the members of the crew (no love interest as in The Thing). The bond of material incentives is already under strain early in the film as Parker and Brett grumble about the size of their shares. And the film's conclusion, as I have</page><page sequence="16">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 293 pointed out, seems to contradict the ideal of group effort in favor of an older, more ruthless struggle for survival. The suppressed fourth term, then, is the utopian impulse itself, as figured in a displaced and deformed way in the wonder and awe which the alien ship invokes. It is non-human, a negation of everything about the Nostromo: the corporate system, the reduction of human beings to tools which can be switched on and off (they are awakened only when necessary for the ship's operation), the subjection of humans to the rule of machines, and the latter's ability to sacrifice the lives of the former. Moreover the alien ship transcends the utilitarian: it has an aesthetic dimension which, as Marcuse never tired of repeating, is the "eternal protest against the organization of life by the logic of domination, the critique of the performance principle."'8 And finally, the concept of the organic which characterizes the ship refers to the unspoken hope for a radically transformed reality, one held together and given force by life-giving and commonly held goals and aspirations, like the ship itself. This organic ship, then, returns SF to its utopian origins, to the dream of a humanized and liberating technology which will be the means of our freedom, "a science and technology released from their service to destruction and exploitation, and thus free for the liberating exigen- cies of the imagination."'9 4. Judith Newton: Feminism and Anxiety in Alien Ridley Scott's Alien is a paradigm of mass culture as "a transformational work on social and political anxieties and fantasies," a work which is at once wish- fulfilling or utopian and protectively repressive in its thrust.20 The most obvi- ously utopian element in Alien is its casting of a female character in the role of individualist hero, a role conventionally played by, and in this case specifically written for, a male. It is Ripley, third officer of the commercial towing vehicle Nostromo, who maintains her composure in the face of the monster, who ultimately defeats it on her own, and who achieves the film's imaginary resolu- tion of anxieties. On the most overt level, the anxieties which this female hero resolves are those having to do with work in a late capitalist society, anxieties which in 1980 can be consciously articulated by most of my students (largely white working- class men and women, many of whom are majoring in accounting). The film evokes, in rather explicit fashion, their uneasy recognition that now everyone is forced to be a company man or company woman, somebody whose work is neither controlled by nor understood by them, and somebody who is finally expendable in the name of profit. The title of the Alien ship, Nostromo, "nostro homo," our man, makes allusion of course to Conrad's working-class hero, another company man, who dies understanding that he has been betrayed by "material interests." What has changed most between Conrad's early imperialist concern and this late-capitalist operation - both are in the mining business - is the degree of alienation to which workers are inured. The Company in Alien represents capitalism in its most systematized, computerized, and dehumanizing form, a fact ironically enforced by the name of the Company computer, "Mother." Throughout the film, mechanization and technology, associated with the Com- pany, are contrasted with the engaging humanity of the workers. Shots of blinking, computerized helmets are juxtaposed, in the film's opening sequence, with glimpses of empty coffee cups and hanging uniforms, both of which evoke the momentary absence of the sleeping crew. At several points, the impressive technology of the Company ship - impressive but liable to malfunction - is</page><page sequence="17">294 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) played off against the ingenuity and practical-mindedness of the crew, who are given to making use of pens or cattle prods or their hands during real emergen- cies. This tension between the human and the mechanical or technological, both associated with the Company, culminates in a vision of the mechanical as fatal-first in Ash, the Company android, a totally dehumanized worker, who threatens the collectivity represented by the human crew, and then in the Alien itself. The Alien, like Ash, is a piece of Company property, and in its later transformations it resembles a mechanical person. "It's like a man," Parker, the black, working-class character observes. Perfectly adaptable, perfectly defended, and (as Ash admiringly points out) 'unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality," the Alien is a "perfect organism" for Company purposes. It is in fact a kind of ultimate Company Man, and the Company means to use it in its own defense, as part of "the weapons division." When Ripley blasts this perfect organism into space, the film expresses two fantasies. The first is that individual action has resolved economic and social horrors, for all the anxieties which the film evokes about the dehumanizing force of late-capitalist labor have been deflected onto the Alien. The second fantasy is that white middle-class women, once integrated into the world of work, will somehow save us from its worst excesses and specifically from its dehumaniza- tion. This fantasy has its roots in 19th-century ideologies about middle-class women, ideologies which maintained that women, as outsiders to the world of early capitalist competition, retained a moral purity which might redeem it - at first in the private sphere of the home, then in the quasi-public sphere of voluntary aid organizations, and ultimately in the public sphere itself. Indeed, Ripley does betray residual traces of an outsider's sensitivity. She is the only crew member to distrust Ash, and her distrust and concern are juxta- posed against the cynicism of Dallas, a white, middle-class male, a traditional insider on his way to becoming a Company person. Dallas says, "Standard procedure is to do what the Company wants you to do." "I just run the ship." "I don't trust anyone." In allowing Ripley to defeat the Company's secret weapon, Alien locates itself inside an ideology to which sectors of the 20th-century women's movement has also subscribed. It is the belief that women, white middle-class women, will make it better. It is a mark of '70s' cynicism and despair, perhaps, that Ripley saves only her own humanity. But the wish-fulfilling, utopian, seemingly feminist, content of Alien, is more extensive than this, for the film not only breaks with the convention of having a male hero, it breaks with conventions of female heroism or female independ- ence as well. It does so, moreover, in a way that draws attention to what it is doing, in a way that tends to leave even Marxist-feminist viewers feeling that the film is "good on women." Ripley's character, for example, appropriates qualities traditionally identified with male, but not masculinist, heroes. Ripley is skilled; she makes hard, unsentimental decisions; she is a firm but humane leader; she has the hero's traditional, and thrilling, resources in the face of the monster. Her quest as hero, moreover, is not diluted by the introduction of a love plot, although "getting the man too" has been a standard qualification of female independence in women's fiction and women's movies since the 1930s. This female hero does not have a sexual involvement with anyone (nor does anyone else among the crew, despite what appears to have been a long flight - the crew is ten months from earth when the film opens). Finally, with the exception of Ash, none of Ripley's peers expresses resentment of her in her role as leader. Indeed, what Alien offers on one level, and to a white, middle-class audience, is a utopian fantasy of women's liberation, a fantasy of economic and social equality, friendship, and collectivity between middle-class women and men.</page><page sequence="18">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 295 But the utopian and wish-fulfilling content of the film is accompanied by the covert expression of anxieties which are more primitive and more extreme than those which the film more overtly associates with work. This second set of anxieties, aroused by the film's specific fantasy of a redeeming female hero and by its more general feminist and utopian content, must be seen as a response to feminism as a collective force, as a force disruptive of traditional gender roles and the sexual division of labor and as a force which can oppose late capitalism itself. Although Alien appears, for example, to omit the private realm of the family, the family and domestic labor are evoked by scenes in which the crew gathers together for their meals. Since food simply appears on the table and since child care is displaced onto pouring milk for the collective cat, the film can be said to arouse and allay anxiety in relation to the family and the sexual division of labor by relieving men and women both of domestic responsibility. (At the same time, however, the film very indirectly retains the identification of domestic work with women since the cooking in this collective appears to be taken care of by the company computer -"Mother.") Male - and especially white, middle-class male - hostility and anxiety over the erosion of traditional gender roles is also present in this film and at the same time contained and managed. Resentment of Ripley's leadership, for example, is deflected onto the two working-class men and onto the android. These maneu- vers allow hostility to be ventilated and vicariously participated in but protect white, middle-class male viewers from having to identify with that ventilation. The two working-class men, who betray only a mild and ineffectual resentment of Ripley - "She better stay the fuck out of my way," says Parker - function, for the most part, as soothing reminders that white, middle-class men are still superior in position to someone. But Ash, who is ostensibly a white, middle-class male herself, scores a series of hostile victories over Ripley in which white male viewers can vicariously participate. Ash disobeys Ripley's orders by admitting the Alien onto the space ship. He defers to Dallas even when Ripley is in command. He refuses to let Ripley look into his microscope. He even proves to be "Mother's" favorite when the computer refuses to expose Special Order 937 to anyone but him. Ash's hostility reaches a violent climax when he beats Ripley up and simulates a rape by trying to shove a rolled-up girly magazine down her throat. At this point, Ash is a covert emblem both of men dehumanized by their work and of men dehumanized by their rage at women; but it is at this point too that Ash is revealed to be an android, a figure safely disassociated from the middle-class male viewer. Ultimately, it is Ripley who must triumph over the threats which Ash covertly represents, and she will do so by taking on that other mechanical man, the Alien itself. The Alien is appropriately the locus of the most primitive - and alien - material which the film evokes, the sexual rage and terror, especially white male terror, which the threatened breakdown of gender roles provokes. With the exception of Parker, the Alien is the focal point of all sexual energy in this movie. The Alien, which is fond of womb-like and vaginal-like spaces, is distinctly phallic, and it attacks Ripley, like a fantasy rapist, while she is undressing. But the Alien is also equipped with a rather impressive set of vaginal teeth. It is born of eggs, and it continually gives birth to itself, once in a gory evocation of childbirth at the diningroom table. In this respect the Alien is a potent expres- sion of male terror at female sexuality and at castrating females in general. Finally, the Alien becomes the site of all anxieties which the feminist gestures of the film evoke; and it is the female hero who must manage them, an allocation of responsibility which can be read as an expression of trust in women's capacity</page><page sequence="19">296 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) for taking care of business or as an exasperated insistence that women clean up the mess they've made. The mechanisms by which the female hero actually achieves this imaginary resolution are keys to the film's transformational work. In her first encounter with an enemy figure (Ash) Ripley is saved by Parker, the working-class black. and by Lambert, the other white female crew member. The film presents us with an intriguing coalition: two white middle-class women and a minority man. The coalition is especially promising because Parker, played by Yaphet Kotto, is the most vigorous and deliberately appealing member of the crew. He is also the member most in opposition to the Company's interests. Parker complains about the Company from the beginning. He gripes about the inequity in bonuses, about the class stratification on board, about the coffee. He complains that picking up aliens is not in his contract, and finally he is enraged that the Company has found its crew expendable: "The damn company, what about our lives?" Black and working class, Parker is also a traditional outsider, and yet he is not allowed to ally himself with Ripley. Indeed the collectivity represented by Ripley, Parker, and Lambert is given us only to be exploded. Parker and Lambert are killed in the next sequence of the film while Ripley, despite the injunction that "we have to stick together," is off looking for the cat. Ripley's previous relation to these two has prepared us, moreover, to feel very little emotional investment in their momentary collectivi- ty. She has had no particular sympathy for the two working-class men - "You'll get what's coming to you," she tells them when they complain about their unequal share of bonuses. She has shown no emotional bonding with the other female. Lambert, who is passive and easily given to hysterics, functions for the most part to define what Ripley is not - emotional, feminine, unheroic. Ripley, as female hero, is not permitted to achieve imaginary resolution when she has been separated from an oppositional and potentially forceful collective. It is in these final moments that the film subtly reinvests Ripley with traditionally feminine qualities. First, while Parker and Lambert are racing to get off the ship, Ripley is sent on a prolonged search for Jonesy the cat. This is an impulsive, humanitarian, and therefore, traditionally feminine action - "Here kitty, kitty, here, sweetheart." Also, immediately before Ripley's encounter with the Alien on the space shuttle, we see her stripped to her bikini underpants, not standard gear for space duty perhaps but exposing a long, and lovingly-recorded, expanse of marvelous body. Finally, both before and after blowing the Alien into space, Ripley is shown tucking her cat into bed. Ripley is not only divested of coalition and reinvested with feminity, she is also reaffirmed as a Company Woman. Despite the Company's betrayal of herself and of the entire crew, Ripley disposes of the Alien only to sit down and complete her captain's log: "Crew - and cargo - destroyed." What we have in Alien, then, is wish-fulfillment and repression of a familiar order. In some respects the film is utopian, for it expresses, through its female hero, the fantasy that white, middle-class women, at their liberated best, can be harmoniously integrated into the late-capitalist world of work, a world they will then symbolically humanize with a residual sensitivity (although in this film the only humanity Ripley salvages is her own). But even this attenuated fantasy- content evokes anxieties, and especially white, middle-class male anxieties, about feminism as a collective and potentially radical force, a force which opposes traditional gender roles, the sexual division of labor, and in some sectors, the oppression of minorities and late capitalism itself. Ultimately, this anxiety content of the film is managed by a figure who must be identified as a</page><page sequence="20">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 297 product of the women's movement - the liberated woman. But she is divested of the oppositional force which the women's movement can also represent. Ripley, though in many ways a fine and thrilling hero, is robbed of radical thrust. Impulsive, nurturing, and sexually desirable, she is not so threatening to men after all. Unallied with minorities, with the working class, or with other women, she is also - and in contrast to Conrad's Nostromo - a Company Woman to the last. Alien is another demonstration of how late capitalism, through its "dominant cultural forms and practices ... strives to sever social experience from the formation of counter-ideologies" and to "pre-empt the effects of association."'" It is an example, to paraphrase John Brenkman, of how mass media establish a schism between what we hear and what we speak, so that we receive messages we would not speak and are made to read in them the figure of our needs, our desires, and our identity.22 5. Tony Safford: Alien/Alienation In discussing Alien, we can make several incisions which allow one to peel away and expose its ideological functions. One such spot would locate the articulation of science and humanism, and opposition which the text seeks to maintain but finally cannot sustain. The opening shots establish this opposition between science and humanism. These early shots inside the spaceship initially oppose an environment of science and hyper-technology to what Barthes might have once called signifiers of "humanicity": human traces, such as personal items and trinkets, are casually placed alongside complex pieces of technology. The clash and incongruity of these signifiers of humanism and science continues to develop through the representation of the crew members. Unlike the comic book repre- sentations in Star Wars, they are "real" human characters embedded within a world of science and technology. However, the scientist, Ash, is "misrecognized" as being human. He is an android sent off by the Company. His desire to know - the desire of science - is responsible for the entry of the Alien into the spacecraft. Ash even comes to say that he admires the Alien as a perfect organism. At this extreme end of science lies the abyss: the Alien. The pure quest for knowledge results in evil. This (ideological) representation of science is anti-humanist, or better, anti-humanitarian: science does not need man, can exist at the expense of man, etc. Ash is "the bad guy," the perfect scientist who acts without emotion, without regard for humani- ty. But the android-scientist is a functionary of the Company, itself a metonym of capitalism. Here we see a rare instance of capitalism being afraid of itself. Capitalism both needs and is afraid of science. It is as if here capitalism realizes that in its quest for knowledge (necessary for its own reproduction) there is something terrible, something alien beyond itself. For capitalism, science can be a very scary thing, and yet capitalism requires its mobilization. Opposed to this representation of science is humanism, represented finally by Ripley. (She has a cat; therefore she is a humanist.) Humanism is good; it must control science, containing and directing its quest for knowledge. This opposi- tion between science and humanism becomes the drama played out between Ash and Ripley. But the ideological work of the film cannot sustain this opposition and in fact comes to contradict it. Ripley, in her last and decisive struggle with the Alien, must "do all the right things." She must push all the right buttons and act with calculation and control. She must be a "perfect" human in the way Ash had been a "perfect" scientist. Here the initial opposition reveals a symmetry: a contradic- tion produced by the work of the text. Caught in its own drama, the text forgets</page><page sequence="21">298 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) its earlier critique of science and now, on a slightly different register, must mobilize it. It is only because Ash has been reduced - pardon the pun - to ashes an hour or so ago in an overwhelmingly suspenseful moment that this contradic- tion is not readily apparent. The text is not troubled here by its own work. But if we find ourselves troubled by the film we become responsible for locating those troubled spots, those sites of rupture. The opposition between humanism and science is one such site of contradiction, and upon its production we can make a very effective cut into the film and its ideological position on science in capital- ism. Slightly rotating our text, we can make another incision which would mark out the figure of the cat. The cat is a sliding signifier, sliding across several registers of signification. And it is in this slide that we can see ideology at work. As it runs its course, Alien has the difficult task of both playing with this signifier and finally trying to anchor its meaning. I would like to suggest that the final anchorage of this signifier is not altogether successful; the text knows it can become unhinged and skid out of control. It prevents this by turning off its engines: the film ends. But we can try and put this signifier back into its slide, a slide across ideology. First of all, the cat is a figure of domesticity, a cultural code which the film imports. It functions to humanize the crew members, Ripley in particular (it seems to be her cat). In this sense the cat is a metonym in the humanization of the characters. But the cat is also a device for motivation in the film's play of suspense. The cat is mistaken - misrecognized - for the Alien. In the first attempt to trap the Alien, the cat is mistaken for the monster and then the reverse. The point here is that a relation of (mis)recognition is established between the cat and the Alien (one might also note here the unexpected, estranging use of close-ups on the cat making it appear immense in the screen space). Taking in some earlier points, we can begin to construct the following system: GOOD EV IL m isrecognition Ripley Ash (NON-HUMAN) (HUMAN) identity The cat the alien (FOREIGN) (DOMESTIC) misrecognition Ripley misrecognizes Ash for a human. Ash as a scientist is identified with the evil of the Alien, and the cat is misrecognized for the Alien. But the cat is a figure-ideological to be sure-of femininity, of enigma, mystery, and sexual otherness. Here the signifier functions as a metaphor. The cat is the metaphoric site of female sexuality, a displacement of the figuration of sexuality. Metonymically, the cat is associated with Ripley and now also metaphorically: it is (like) her. Having said this, we can close the box above in a circuit of identity and misrecognition. But how can we now articulate the relationship between Ripley, the cat, and the Alien? If the cat is a figure bridging Ripley and the monster, what does she conquer by destroying it? What does she destroy? Is the threat of the Alien also the threat of women to the symbolic order of patriarchy? Is the film's</page><page sequence="22">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 299 ending Hollywood's version of "affirmative action" (which some really seem to think) or is this affirmation of woman as heroine the negation of her threat to the symbolic? Who or what is "alien" to this symbolic order? To continue this line of questioning a little further, the text works to eliminate Ash, to erase its ideological representation of science. (He is no longer a factor mid-way through the film.) We are then left with a triangle between Ripley, the cat, and the Alien: GOOD EVIL Ripley the cat the alien But by the end of the film and the destruction of the Alien, we are left with just a line of identity between the woman and the cat. The film leaves us with woman and cat: domesticity restored. But can the film now anchor the slide of the cat signifier from moving back towards the Alien? Can the Alien's presence be totally effaced, or can it instead slide back along the misrecognition-identity circuits through the cat to Ripley? Can the domestic ending now overdetermine and abolish all the relations previously established between these poles? I was pleased to hear a reading of the film which understood the cat to have been impregnated by the Alien. The signifier drifts out of control. At its close the text tries to domesticate itself, to be at home with itself. It can stop the irresistible drift of the cat only by shutting off: the film is over, at home with itself. But we are not at home with the film's ending. Yet, in another sense we should recognize our desire precisely to not be at home with the film. Our desire is alienated in a bourgeois society and to destroy a text of this alien culture makes us strangely, negatively at home. 6. Clayton Lee: Cognitive Approaches to Alien Alien has been characterized as a "space gothic" which "partakes as much of baroque, Gothic (or simply downbeat contemporary) as of the usual well- scrubbed futurist chic."23'Alien's "stylish horror" as a genre film forms a locus for a theoretical intersection of variety of critical methods. In a period where post-Modernist visual art has been termed "Mannerist," the concept of maniera as "stylish style" might provide a means of opening the analysis of popular cultural objects like film to Marxist analyses which mingle perceptual, cogni- tive, and material perspectives.24 The theoretical task will be to locate film within the class struggle as a conflicting unity of various perspectives. This attempt places the film and its audience within a context historically conditioned and perceptually rooted. The broader context of the film is delineated not only as a product of the economic and ideological means of production, but also as owned by the class that appropriates the production of antagonistic social forces.25 It is additionally delineated by inserting Alien into the tradition and system of its genre. A genre, as Darko Suvin indicates, is "a socioaesthetic entity with a specific inner life, yet in a constant osmosis with other ... genres, science, philosophy, perspectives from everyday socio-economic life and so on."27 Choosing perspectives from semiotics, phenomenology, and the history of</page><page sequence="23">300 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) art, we can see the film as a text and referent which emphasizes the cognitive. This maintains an affinity with Suvin's conception of SF as "a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author's empirical environment."27 The filmic apparatus denotatively accomplishes some of those goals, but it is the cinematic perceptual situation which creates the cognitive conditions allowing the interac- tion of cognition and estrangement. By stressing cinematic effect, the connota- tive context is not secondary, as Metz asserts, but codetermines the various pre-texts and subtexts which constitute the primary text. The escapist stereotype associated with the SF/horror film should be corrected to read as estrangement. While the Gothic film "horrifies" us, we note its material familiarity and become open to critical perspectives beyond its spatio- temporal boundaries. Suvin quotes Brecht on this: "A representation which estranges is one which allows us to recognize its subject, but at the same time makes it seem unfamiliar."28 This recognition indicates a "dialectical permeabil- ity" presupposed by the genre film as a socioaesthetic entity, with implicit pre-texts and subtexts, located in this world. As Jean-Lou Bourget states in an article on the social implications evident in Hollywood genre films, the conflict between pre-text/subtext and the total text provides a reconciliation of auteur theory and iconological approaches to film. Bourget indicates that the Hollywood director uses genre conventions with their political subtexts to describe and criticize social structures by an "interplay of implicit meanings either subtly different from or actually clashing with the conventional self-gratification."29 Self-gratification here is that received estrange- ment which functions in a conflict situation designed to criticize a present state of society. The signs of that estrangement might then be aligned according to Peircean features of icon/index/symbol. Peirce divided icons into images and diagrams as signs (i.e., a portrait of a person resembles her or him) and stated that an index was a sign by virtue of an existential connection between itself and its object (i.e., a sundial indicates the time of day). Symbol for Peirce functioned as an arbitrary sign convention. Iconic and indexical distinctions can be first seen in the opposition of non- organic and organic imagery to the forms of the spaceships in Alien. The Nostromo is a classic electronic-mechanical form in the tradition of 2001: A Space Odyssey, while the alien derelict spaceship is distinctly biological- mechanical. This biological-mechanical fusion provides the context for the monster's introduction and is the setting initiating a phenomenological treat- ment of Alien. The comparison of ship forms invites a comparison between Alien and its pre-text influence, the SF/horror film, The Thing (Which Came From Outer Space, 1951), directed by Christian Nyby. The Thing contains structural similarities to Alien as well as being an impor- tant childhood influence on Alien's screenwriter, Dan O'Bannon.30 Briefly, The Thing featured these similar themes: dormant alien life-forms are found while investigating a derelict alien ship; the alien is valued as superior because of its essential qualities inherent in a vegetal construction; an equal role is given to a woman in the search party, the role of science and scientists is depicted as empirical and acquisitive, and fire is used as an initial defense preceding a final incineration of the monster. In concert with O'Bannon's principal Alien influ- ence, his 1972 film, Dark Star, develops the theme of cryogenics seen in all three films and signals the phenomenological foundation for analysis. Cryogenics precludes interment or autopsy, which etymologically signifies the act of seeing</page><page sequence="24">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 301 with one's own eyes. The act of seeing as a phenomenological procedure suggests an episode citing the use of phenomenology in Dark Star. In that film, the spaceship's second officer assumes command upon the death of the captain (as in Alien), and converses with the cryogenically "frozen" captain about disarming a nuclear bomb whose personified control computer refuses to dis- arm itself. The dead captain suggests that the officer "teach the bomb phenom- enology." The resulting discourse between officer and bomb results in an explosion preceded by a disembodied computer voice counting down the final seconds (similar to Alien ' Nostromo explosion). Also, a phenomenological analysis will allow us to make a distinction between Renaissance-Classical and Mannerist-Anticlassical films. According to this dichotomy, films such as 2001 and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari might be the Renaissance-Classical progenitors of the Mannerist-Anticlassical films, The Thing, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Alien. If the "realistic, photographic" Renaissance space postulated by Jean-Louis Baudry provides a tangible representation of metaphysics,30 then this principle of transcendence as classicism can be opposed by a "Mannerist" film. Such a film might rely on denotative aspects which help define the genre, such as unstable spatial relationships, anamorphic photographic formats, rotascoping within a space predicated on scale models, and low-light interior shots disrupted by stroboscopic effects. A Mannerist film would subsume a concept of Gothic similar to those presented by Stephen Farber and Marc Le Sueur.32 Such a film attempts to locate the percipient in actual rather than filmic reality by producing a problematic relationship of form to content and perhaps relocating the filmic experience within the lived experience of the percipient, "both inside and outside us, as a kind of waking dream." Renaissance concepts of symmetry as a classical signified versus Mannerist "distortion" signified can be seen in Alien's spaceships. The humanoid ship, Nostromo, appears as a symmetrically determined form which might also be termed a "phallic" form in its segmentation of control and operations functions. The alien derelict spaceship features a horseshoe shape with organic motifs reminiscent of centralized "vaginal" imagery emphasized in contemporary feminist visual art.33 The filmic contrast can be also seen in the different varieties of interior space presented by each ship. The cluttered claustrophobic interior shots of the Nostromo can be compared with the oblique orientation of shots of the derelict in the way that Paul Schrader has compared the films of Carl Dreyer to Gothic architecture.34 Ridley Scott, Alien's director, recognizes this same connection: "The Derelict had to be cavernous -to suggest a warehouse or cargo hold -because it's a freighter; ironically, the crew of the Nostromo are entering the same kind of ship they've just left. [H.R.] Giger [the designer of Alien's monster and derelict sets] got the effect I needed, adding the sense of a Gothic cathedral with sinister overtones."35 The naval architecture of Alien compares a cathedral-like cruciform layout of the Nostromo with the derelict's serpentine form. The cruciform, as symmetric and as a Renaissance signified, functions as the kind of architectonic formation that is imbedded in daily life, within large-scale communication events.36 Ash, the Nostromo's science officer and a covert robot agent of Alien's ubiquitous Company, states his admiration for the monster's "simple symmetry." That symmetry is associated with the monster's parasitic adaptability within any given environment. That sentiment's cognitive implications can be seen in contempo- rary perceptual theory: "An organism possesses the highest degree of adapta-, tion to its environment when the highest degree of symmetry exists between its</page><page sequence="25">302 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) states (both biological and psychological) and the states of its environment."37 Coupled with Leibniz's view of symmetry as an indiscernibility of differences, such a symmetry postulate for cognitive theory indicates the kinds of indiscernibility of differences which are used by Alien's Company or any company to ensure ideological hegemony. In the films under discussion, causation, science, authority, and ideology come forward to displace the notion of the film narrative as hermetic and isolated from material reality. The Thing introduces a science and scientists interested in keeping a militarily dangerous being intact. They want to befriend and understand it. In Dark Star, an alien is collected as a pet. Alien's Company carries out the military purpose of science, personifies its ideology in a covert robot, Ash, and attempts to sacrifice human life in order to collect a dangerous alien life-form. Within The Thing and Alien, science and scientists present an empiricist ideology which rationalizes actions to achieve a covert purpose. Authority, in the form of military and scientific perogatives, is opposed in The Thing, whereas in Alien military and corporate purposes are merged. A final report must be given. The film functions as a document to be replayed on a viewer, as the beginning titling sequence describes the mission and the Nostromo's specifications. This signified authority exists beyond the film and bears a resem- blance to the framing narrative devices used in Caligari and Invasion. In the film, the framing narrative functions as a bracketing device by providing an ideological disclaimer. It is a means of bracketing the film from reality and emphasizing its self-gratifying use. This isolation of the effect of the film limits its subversive capabilities. In Caligari, authority figures are maintained, and the locus of evil shifts to the supposed insanity of the original hero.?8 In Invasion, the possibility of the F.B.I. controlling the pods is added in a framing narrative to circumvent mass hysteria as much as the changed ending of Caligari.39 NOTES 1.

In addition to my own trips to the movies I have relied on three works for the SF film: John Baxter, Science Fiction in the Cinema (NY, 1970); John Brosnan, Future Tense: The Cinema of Science Fiction (London, 1978); and James Robert Paris and Michael R. Pitts, The Great Science Fiction Pictures (Metuchen, NJ: 1977). These works generally confirm the three waves I describe, although the specific interpretations are my own. Based on the more than 145 SF films discussed, I established the following profile for the years 1950-1976: in the years 1950-1961 there were more than 130 SF films made, beginning with</page><page sequence="26">SYMPOSIUM ON ALIEN 303 3 in 1950 and ending with 12 in 1961, and peaking with 23 in 1958. The second wave begins in 1965 with 13 films (there were 21 films in the three years 1962-1964) and 13 films again in 1966; in the following years production did not rise above 10 per year until 1971. And since 1972 there has been an average of only 5 SF films per year, including a number of SF films made for television. 10. This film is usually attributed to the film's producer, Howard Hawks. It is based on John Campbell's story, "Who Goes There."

Un Symposium sur Alien - Jackie Byars, animateur de ce debat sur Alien, resume lefilm en insistantsurles traits topiques et les ideologemes les plus patents. II presente ensuite les points de vue et theses des differents participants a' ce symposium. Pour sa part, en s'inspirant d'une remarque de W. Benjamin, il s'attache au mode de transmission de ce dispositif ideologique quest Alien. Alien temoigne des transforma- tions radicales de l'industriefilmique ame'ricaine. Le vieux systeme hollywoodien est mort dans les annees soixante. Son role d'homogenisateur de la culture U.S. a ete transmis 'a la telMvision. Alien, avec son cout de 10 millions de dollars, est typique de la technique des megasucce's contemporains ("Blockbusters"). Jeff Gould centre son analyse du film sur la maniiere dont il transpose et allegorise les rapports sociaux d'une societe post-industrielle. L'extraterrestre, dans sa perfection mena,cante, est lui-meme un analogue des corporations multinationales. Peter Fitting voit dans Alien un bon exemple de lafaion dont les artefacts culturels visent a resoudre dans l'imaginaire des contradictions de la societe' reelle. II relie lefilm 'a la longue tradition du cinema de SF "a monstres "et a sa vulgarisation de themesfreudiens lies aux effets d'horreur (lies aussi a une allegorie des craintes imperialistes face a la barbarie tiers-mondiste et aux exigences des exploites). Le besoin qu 'eprouve le specta- teur de films centres sur ces themes et ces types d'affects doit etre examine: de tels films sont des leurres qui jouent avec l'alienation et les frustrations contradictoires du public. L'impulsion utopique en estforclose. Judith Newton s 'interesse spe'cialement au personnagefeminin, Ripley, en position de heros individualiste dans le film. Le film ici joue avec certaines angoisses fiminines, mais aussi il fait un usage ambigu de certains lieux communs du mouvement feministe. L'extraterrestre, phallique, est une expression de la terreur masculine face a la sexualite des femmes et a la castration. Tony Safford traite de la representation grinqante de la Volonte6 de Savoir, incar- ne,e dans l'androide Ash. Le conflit entre science et humanisme est essentiel a l'intrigue. L'humain et I 'animal domestique (le chat) s 'opposentparadigmatiquement a I 'androide et a l'extraterrestre. Clayton Lee voit dans lefilm un e'chantillon d'une esthetique manie'riste et baroque propre a l'ere post-moderne. Il examine la combinaison de distanciation cognitive et d 'horreur, et rapproche Alien d 'autres films recents de SF et d 'horreur. (MA)</page></plain_text>
