However, these models omit the contributions of psychoanalytic psychology to the understanding of religious functioning. The schema presented in this article reformulates current models of faith development in light of insights from psychodynamic and object relations theory. Description of the fifth stage, the high est level of religious development, represents a composite of the literature on religious maturity. The first objective of this synthesis and reformulation is to offer descriptive criteria by which psychotherapists can discriminate a healthy from an unhealthy religious outlook. The second is to illuminate the intrapsychic dynamics underlying unhealthy religiousness in adults. Such a conceptual framework should assist psychotherapists working with religiously committed pa tients in assessing their general level of psychospiritual functioning. The psychological study of religious development is rooted in efforts to distin guish healthy from unhealthy forms of religious expression. William James, in his classic work, The Varieties of Religious Experience, distinguished be tween "healthy minded" religion and the pessimistic religious outlook of the "sick soul."1 James's formulation became a prototype that stimulated a tradition of di chotomizing religiousness into two opposing types, one representing a mature form of religious functioning and the other a psychologically unhealthy reli gious outlook.2 This tradition culminated in Allport's intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientation dimensions.3 Intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness were defined in terms of specific psychological motivations for being religious. When extrinsic religious motivation is present, religion is used defensively by an individual to provide a powerful in-group, justification for one's formula for living, or a defense against reality. Allport considered this instrumental, utilitarian approach to religion to be less healthy than an intrinsic motiva Vicky Genia, Psy.D., is with the American University Center for Psychological and Learning Services in Washington, D.C. 85 ? 1990 Institutes of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="2">86 Journal of Religion and Health tion in which one's religious faith is lived as an end in itself, functioning as a foundation for one's choices, and giving meaning to life's experiences. Other multidimensional theoretical frameworks have also been proposed.4 However, these frameworks neither illuminate the relations among the reli gious dimensions5 nor explain the dynamic processes underlying individual differences on the dimensions. These failures have led recent investigators to shift away from the multidimensional approach toward a developmental the ory of religiousness. This shift was initiated when investigators began to conceptualize the reli gious functioning of individuals in light of theoretical models of psychosocial, ego, cognitive, and moral development.6 This creative synthesis of religious and developmental psychology suggested that the less mature, extrinsic form of religiousness observed in some adults represented fixation in the earlier phases of a normal religious developmental pathway beginning in early childhood and continuing throughout life's journey.7 Adults functioning at a more mature intrinsic level were seen as having progressed to higher levels of religious development. These ideas germinated into several proposed stage models of religious/ faith development, each describing a normative process of faith development independent of specific theological content.8 These models attempt to eluci date the general structural changes in religious thinking, feeling, and experi encing that unfold as the individual grows and matures. This process begins with a highly egocentric religiosity of childhood and, if conditions are favor able, culminates in a well-integrated and autonomous religiousness of middle adulthood. However, although these current theories of faith development postulate stages of religious functioning that roughly correspond to, and appear log ically consistent with, models of ego, cognitive, moral, and psychosocial devel opment, they leave out the contributions that psychoanalytic developmental psychology and object relations theory have made to the understanding of religious functioning.9 The stages that make up the model presented in this article integrate these contributions into current theories of religious development to illuminate more fully the psychological factors underlying religious underdevelopment in adults. In its current stage of conceptual development, this reformulation may serve as a descriptive guideline for assessing the religious patient's gen eral level of psychospiritual functioning. It is hoped that more precise thera peutic applications will follow from further expansion, refinement, and em pirical grounding of this model. The fifth stage of the model, "transcendent faith," describes the highest level of religious development. As such, it represents an ideal. Individuals functioning at this level are not likely to enter therapy with religious con cerns. Formulation of this stage reflects a synthesis of the existing literature on religious maturity and is offered as a guideline by which clinicians can</page><page sequence="3">Vicky Genia 87 assess the degree to which an individual possesses a healthy religious out look. In sum, the model presented in this article builds upon current theories of faith development. It synthesizes those features that seem most useful for psychotherapists in understanding religiously committed patients. In addi tion, it expands existing conceptualizations by incorporating insights from psychoanalytic developmental psychology and object relations theory. Fi nally, for each of the first four stages, suggestions for therapeutic goals are presented as guidelines for clinicians. Stage I: Egocentric faith The hallmark of this first stage is egocentricity. The adult who functions religiously at this stage of development is also likely to manifest narcissism and self-centeredness in other areas as well. Thus, religious expression and imagery are simply one manifestation of an overall immature personality development.10 In terms of moral development, the individual at this stage is most likely to display Kohlberg's heteronomous morality.11 At this level, the individual judges the Tightness or wrongness of actions in terms of anticipated reward or punishment. Behavior is based upon its immediate consequences for the actor with little or no consideration for the needs of others. Psychosocially, the egocentric individual has not acquired a basic sense of trust which is necessary for building a positive self-concept and healthy inter personal relationships.12 Object relations theorists claim that if a strong sense of security is not acquired during separation-individuation, the child is unable to form stable internal images of others.13 Perceptions of others are confined to their present availability as need-gratifying objects. Adults functioning at this stage are unable to transform memories of past experiences and information from the total context into a realistic and whole concept of the other. Instead, the per son "splits" others into either "all-good" or "all-bad" depending upon how well the other is at present satisfying his or her psychological and emotional needs. There is little recognition or consideration of the needs, wishes, or feelings of others. In the religious arena, these dynamics may be observed in the individual's descriptions of God images, relationship to God, and quality of prayer.14 Lack ing the ego structuralization or emotional integration necessary for stable, internal object representations, perceptions of God are also based upon need gratification and accompanying affect. For the religiously egocentric, images of God fluctuate, depending upon individual circumstances. Misfortunes elicit anger toward a vengeful "all-bad" God figure who is perceived as having pun ished the individual unjustly. This anger may lead to fear of God's abandon</page><page sequence="4">88 Journal of Religion and Health ment, and attempts to restore the idealized "all-good" divine figure may en sue in a variety of ways depending upon the prescriptions of the individual's particular doctrine. An alternative dynamic that may occur is a splitting of the all-good self-object into a benevolent God figure and the all-bad self-object into a Satanic image.15 Also, because God is viewed narcissistically as an extension of self, divine images are anthropomorphic. Anthropomorphism at this stage reflects the lack of strong ego boundaries and firm differentiation between self and other that characterize early failures in ego development. For the individual at this stage, prayer is primarily petitionary, which not only reflects the egocentricity but also the magical thinking that character izes individuals having weak ego integration.16 Confession is motivated by fear of punishment for perceived transgressions or sins rather than by true guilt, sorrow, or repentance. In sum, the individual in therapy who manifests a highly egocentric reli gious outlook provides strong evidence for the existence of severe charac terological disturbances resulting from early developmental failures. Patients in this stage need intense, long-term therapeutic work to strengthen the ego and build a stable sense of self and others. Stage II: Dogmatic faith Although this stage contains residues of egocentricity, anthropomorphism, and magical thinking, there are qualitative differences in ego functioning that differentiate dogmatic individuals from those in the egocentric stage. It is important to emphasize that adherence to religious doctrine or creed should not in itself be interpreted as a pathological sign. Indeed, a shared religious value system is the cornerstone for many deeply spiritual individ uals. Adherence to doctrine should be considered unhealthy only when used defensively as an external source of psychological support. Thus, the dog matic, authoritarian use of religion is distinguished here from those in higher stages who have internalized a religious ideological system. The individual at this stage is likely to display an instrumental exchange or law-and-order morality.17 Moral judgment at this level is based on fixed rules of fairness and clearly defined duties and obligations in conformity to one's reference group. Although morality is still egocentric, there is recogni tion of the rights and needs of others. This attitude of reciprocity and sense of responsibility distinguishes the dogmatic from the egocentric individual. Fur thermore, a morality of reciprocity and duty implies a basic trust that others can be relied upon to be fair, which in turn requires stable, internal object representations. For individuals functioning at this stage, religious dogma provides the rules for reciprocal exchange between the individual and God. Judgments of right and wrong are based upon obedience to the rules without consideration</page><page sequence="5">Vicky Genia 89 of the situational context. Because these individuals need clear guidelines, they tend to interpret scriptural authority literally and view its contents as absolute. Psychodynamically, individuals at this stage are plagued by oedipal diffi culties and lack self-esteem. Since their self-worth depends upon the approval of others, they fear rejection and loss of love. Psychosocially, their chronic and intense guilt inhibits spontaneity and initiative. These individuals de fend against their insecurity and unacceptable impulses by repression rather than splitting.18 Developmentally, problems stem from an oppressive super ego rather than the lack of sufficient ego controls which characterize egocen tric individuals. For the religiously dogmatic individual, repression is aided by erecting a strong, authoritarian belief system. Dogmatic adherence to creed and perfec tionist performance of ritual are used to maintain internal controls and de fend against excessive guilt and fear of rejection. Prayer may take the form of bargaining with God by making promises to be more obedient in exchange for personal favors or assurance of God's love. Confession is motivated by the fear of losing God's love rather than by fear of abandonment or attempts to re-establish the all-good self-God union. Guilt over trangressions represents fear of one's own conscience, which has been projected onto a punitive God image. That is, guilt results from infraction of introjected standards rather than self-criticism in response to violation of internalized moral principles. Reconciliation with God through confession re-establishes the person's self esteem. Unlike the egocentric individual, the person in the dogmatic stage has strong ego boundaries which clearly differentiate self from other. Thus, an thropomorphism at this stage reflects the person's strong need for external structure and support, which are partly obtained by visualizing a concrete God image rather than a need for symbiotic merger with an all-good, omnipo tent figure. Unlike the egocentric individual's, the dogmatic person's religion is very much embedded in a socio-cultural context. Security is maintained not only through the individual's own obedience to creed but through identification with a religious group. Thus, conformity to the group is paramount, and au thority is not questioned. Social interest may extend beyond passive identi fication and may take the form of fanaticism and proseletyzing in order to confirm one's own beliefs, defend against doubt, and bolster self-esteem by aggressively asserting one's own group as superior. Furthermore, the fanati cism of the dogmatic individual provides an acceptable outlet for hostile im pulses. One's aggression is turned outward in moralistic and condemnatory judgments of those with different beliefs and ideologies. Intolerance of beliefs different from one's own signifies the defensive nature of dogma. Exposure to differences arouses feelings of doubt which threaten the individual's integ rity.</page><page sequence="6">90 Journal of Religion and Health Therapy with dogmatic patients should focus on helping the individual gain greater acceptance of self and others, and move from an external to an internal locus of authority. It is important to note that the legalist may be found in both of the above stages, and it is important for the therapist to assess carefully the individ ual's scrupulosity in terms of whether or not the dynamics involve splitting or repression. The legalist in the egocentric stage displays signs of splitting. For the egocentric individual, rigid obedience to dogma re-establishes the all good self-God image by restoring the individual's symbiotic union with the idealized divine representation. Disobedience leads to splitting into the all bad self-God or self-Satan image manifested by intense fear of abandonment or punishment by God. Thus, the egocentric legalist attempts to preserve the all-good self-God representation by compulsive and rigid adherence to reli gious commands, ritual, and dogma. Conversely, the scrupulosity of the dogmatic legalist stems from a harsh superego and represents a strong defense against sexual and aggressive im pulses. For these individuals, disobedience to religious dogma results in fear of the superego and loss of self-esteem which is projected onto a punitive God figure and transformed into fear of losing God's love. Stage III: Transitional faith In the normal developmental process, a shift in religious thinking usually occurs during adolescence, and corresponds to other major developmental changes during this period.19 Significant among these changes is the shift from a reciprocal exchange moral perspective to a morality of mutual inter personal relations.20 This change is predicated upon a newly acquired capac ity for mutual interpersonal perspective taking, which enables adolescents to transcend their own world views and dispassionately apprehend the perspec tives of others. Kao has labeled this stage doubting faith.21 Although the positive effects of healthy doubt have been explored and recounted by religionists and psycholo gists of religion,22 for many people having religious doubts is equated with lack of faith. Because the word doubt generally carries a pejorative connota tion, I have named this stage transitional faith. This term is based on Kao's comment that "adolescent faith is transitional [italics added] to a new stage of individuative-reflective faith. Transition depends upon . . . freedom to engage in questioning and doubt."23 Empirical evidence for the existence of an adolescent transitional stage characterized by doubt and uncertainty emerges from an investigation of age and religious orientation.24 Data from this study indicate that a stage of reli gious searching appears to be a transition movement from an immature ex</page><page sequence="7">Vicky Genia 91 trinsic religiousness to a more healthy intrinsic religious commitment. Fur thermore, this period of searching seems to peak during adolescence. Although a transition away from egocentric and dogmatic religious think ing usually begins in adolescence,25 for some individuals it may occur much later. For some adults, a shift in religious outlook accompanies changes in other dimensions of the person's personality. But whatever the particular in dividual circumstances, transition to a reconstructed, more internal, differen tiated, and personally integrating religious ideological system is set into mo tion when "persons encounter and respond to situations or contexts that lead to critical reflection on their tacit value systems."26 Psychosocially, this stage parallels the identity crisis typical of adolescents.27 The questioning and doubt that are the hallmark of the transitional stage usually lead to a crumbling of the previously secure faith structure, resulting in an intense period of confusion and emotional turmoil. Before reaching a higher level of autonomy, there may ensue a period of "trying on" different ideologies. Experimentation may involve denominational or affiliational switching, investigation of nontraditional sects or cults, and church hopping. During this stage experimentation is stimulated more by rebellion against prior religious authorities and attempts to reformulate one's spiritual iden tity than by the mature exploration, accomodation, and assimilation charac teristic of those in stage five. Patients in this transitional period of uncertainty and confusion need a great deal of emotional support as they critically examine their religious be liefs, reclarify values, and commit themselves to a self-chosen faith. Stage TV: Reconstructed internalized faith Under favorable conditions the exploration, critical reflection, and introspec tion of the transitional stage will culminate in commitment to a self-chosen faith that transcends egocentric and utilitarian concerns. At this stage, reli gious ideology provides the individual with a sense of purpose and meaning in life. Although adherence to doctrine and scripture may be important to individuals at this stage, such doctrine does not serve the defensive and util itarian functions that characterize dogmatically religious individuals. For in dividuals in stage four, religious doctrine is more complex and not confined by the literalness, concreteness, and conceptual simplicity of those with a dogmatic orientation. Psychodynamically, whereas the dogmatic individual has introjected a moral code and religious doctrine without critical examination, the person who has reconstructed his or her belief system has internalized the standards of his or her faith. Guided by the ego ideal component of the superego instead of its more oppressive and punitive function, religious doctrine functions as</page><page sequence="8">92 Journal of Religion and Health an internalized foundation for life's choices. Furthermore, religious standards for individuals in this stage are comprehensive and consistently applied rather than compartmentalized and peripheral to the central focuses of one's life.28 For individuals operating from a reconstructed faith orientation, morality is guided by social contract.29 Moral decisions are made in accordance with civil law and socio-cultural norms when these are not in direct violation of the prescriptions of one's religious code. Although endowed with the cognitive capabilities for discriminating shades of differences, the thinking style of those functioning in stage four tends to be dichotomous and in terms of absolutes. This is because individuals at this stage lack the tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty, and ability to appre ciate the paradoxical nature30 and multidimensionality31 of religiousness that characterize those in stage five. Although individuals in this stage do not condemn diversity, and respect the freedom of others to choose a faith system different from their own, they make little attempt to expand their own belief system by incorporating and integrating ideas from other religious traditions. Psychosocially, the internally religious initiate social action in accordance with the ideals of their particular theology. Although sometimes zealous in converting others, their missionary zeal stems less from insecurity and more from a sincere desire to care for others by sharing the joys of their faith. Proseletyzing stops short of fanaticism, and true believers will extend assis tance to others in spite of theological and ideological differences. Transcending egocentric petition, the prayers of the internally religious include thanksgiving, praise, and devotion. Guilt is determined less by the extent of disobedience to fixed standards than to internal evaluation of wrongdoing in specific situations. Thus, confession stems from constructive sorrow. Unlike dogmatic individuals, the internally religious individual does not indulge in excessive guilt and self-blame. Acceptance of God's forgiveness follows repentance for wrongdoing and commitment to take corrective action. Research conducted in the area of intrinsic-extrinsic religiousness indicates that the internally religious, overall, tend to be more psychologically and emotionally healthy than those in earlier stages of religious development.32 For the patient in therapy at this stage of religious development, therapeutic goals may consist of strategies designed to expand and enrich the individual's spiritual outlook. In this endeavor, a psychospiritual growth group33 may be a potent influence in helping the internally religious patient to become more open to "the voices of one's 'deeper self and receptive to "a more dialectical and multileveled approach to life truth."34 Stage V: Transcendent faith The criteria for this stage represent a synthesis of the literature on religious maturity.35 Although there is considerable overlap between this stage and</page><page sequence="9">Vicky Genia 93 stage four, transcendent faith is more flexibly guided by a universal princi pled morality and consists of more permeable psychospiritual boundaries. 1. Transcendent relationship to something greater than oneself. William James broadly defines religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of indi viduals ... so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to what ever they may consider the divine."36 Anderson states that "the awareness of a force in creation greater than ourselves and our acknowledgement of it is an essential part of what religion is all about."37 Others insist that this essen tial awareness and acknowledgment must also include the feeling of union or personal connection to the divine and harmonious relationship to the uni verse and totality of existence.38 Indeed, central to religious maturity within any faith tradition is the quality of relationship between the believer and his or her conceptualization of the transcendent. For the religiously mature, this relationship is divested of egocentric and utilitarian motives as much as is humanly possible. 2. Style of living, including moral behavior, is consistent with religious values. A mature religious faith is more than verbal adherence to a set of beliefs or passive awareness of a divine power. It involves a personal commit ment that is reflected in living one's life in accordance with religious values.39 For the religiously mature, religion functions as a foundation for moral deci sions and guidelines for action in all spheres of life. However, this commit ment constitutes neither absolute conformity to some external standard, com pulsively and rigidly imposed upon oneself, nor selective adherence when convenient or expedient. For the religiously mature, religious beliefs and values function as a guiding system that becomes internalized and integrated with one's life experience and conscience. 3. Commitment without absolute certainty. The salubrious effects of critical examination and questioning of one's religious beliefs have been explored by many religionists and psychologists of religion.40 Allport's contention that "the mature religious sentiment is fashioned in the workshop of doubt"41 re flects the paradox that it is by questioning one's faith that religious convic tions and commitment are strengthened. Although some religious denominations have equated doubt with lack of faith, faith and doubt need not be mutually exclusive. Religious commitment can be held tentatively without losing its potency for emotional experience and moral action.42 We operate on the basis of incomplete knowledge in all spheres of life. Indeed, some of the most important decisions in our lives are made on probability and not absolute certainty. For example, physicians treat physical illnesses with available methods until new and more effective treatments are discovered and perfected. Similarly, religious persons can re main committed to and behave in accordance with their particular faith while seeking to discover higher levels of spiritual knowledge and truth.</page><page sequence="10">94 Journal of Religion and Health 4. Openness to religiously diverse viewpoints. Critical for religious growth and related to the tentativeness by which a mature religious outlook is main tained is an openness to religious faiths and ideological systems that are dif ferent from one's own.43 As Fromm asserts, ". . . no man can presume to have any knowledge of God which permits him to criticize or condemn his fellow man or to claim that his own idea of God is the right one."44 However, an individual in stage five goes beyond the mere tolerance of religious differences characteristic of a reconstructed faith orientation. A transcendent faith involves a willingness to explore critically unfamiliar reli gious territory in order to expand the boundaries of one's own understanding of religious truth. 5. A mature religious faith is divested of egocentricity, magical thinking, and anthropomorphic God concepts. Religion that is used for magical wish fulfillment of egocentric needs or to achieve union with an idealized benevo lent, all-knowing, all-powerful parent figure is the hallmark of an immature, self-serving, and utilitarian religiousness.45 In less mature stages of religious development, religion is used through various psychological defenses to provide a sense of security in a world per ceived as threatening, and to maintain a positive sense of self. By contrast, the religiously mature transcend the self through commitment to that divine power or ultimate force that is greater than self. In other words, the reli giously immature attempt to fit God into their own socio-psychological boundaries. Conversely, the religiously mature seek to transcend their own psychosocial boundaries toward higher levels of awareness and being. 6. A mature religious outlook includes both rational and emotional compo nents. According to Anderson, "... a healthy religion is one that is emo tionally satisfying and intellectually convincing."46 Most experts in religious psychology agree that a mature religious outlook contains a balance between reason and emotion. Contemplation of the life experience uncovers troublesome and philosophi cally complex problems of human existence. Issues such as the inevitability of death, tragedy, and human suffering, and the problem of good and evil have challenged the minds of the greatest philosophers, scientists, artists, literary writers, and theologians since the dawn of history. Entrance to religious ma turity cannot be made by sidestepping or leaping over these critical issues. The pathway to religious maturity is a difficult one, and the traveler must struggle with these and other important existential concerns. For the reli giously mature, faith must provide workable yet tentative solutions to these difficult issues which are compatible with logical thought.47 On the other hand, the religious experience that is a purely intellectual affair is missing an essential ingredient. Equally important to intellectual understanding is a feeling of personal connection and relationship to the ulti</page><page sequence="11">Vicky Genia 95 mate.48 It is this emotional component of religious faith that provides a dy namic quality to one's world view and that makes the religious meaning more solidifying and complete than that of nonreligious ideological systems.49 7. Social interest and humanitarian concern. According to Fromm, the most important attribute of a religiously mature outlook is a strong social interest and compassionate concern for improving the human condition and quality of life for all.50 For Fromm, the religious quest to fulfill the highest potential in humankind is not just an individual goal toward which each person strives in isolation. Instead, the goal is a collective one toward which humankind as a whole is challenged to build a higher social order through productive love, reason, and cooperative unity. A mature religious expression takes seriously the command to "love thy neighbor as thyself through passionate commit ment and effective action, not only toward self-realization but toward the realization of humankind as well. By confronting life's challenges beyond their own egocentric orbits, the religiously mature "bear the fruits" of truly living their religious commitment through productive love and work. 8. Mature religiousness is life enhancing and growth producing. A mature religious quest elicits the natural unfolding of the self. Its purpose is not to inhibit, suppress, or deny parts of the self but to integrate all aspects of the personality into a unified whole and to provide healthy channels for the ex pression of one's human needs and desires.51 A healthy religiousness encourages involvement in life rather than fearful separation. It stimulates a generally optimistic view of the world and of hu man nature, although not one that is na?ve in denying the reality of tragedy and suffering. Consistent with Fromm's emphasis on social and human itarian concerns, the religiously mature attempt to mobilize the human po tential for growth rather than dwelling upon humankind's sinful nature and life's more distasteful attributes. A mature religious outlook balances humility with healthy, positive self esteem and emphasizes forgiveness over guilt.52 Although the religiously ma ture accept responsibility and experience guilt for wrongdoing, they reject excessive self-condemnation. 9. Meaning and purpose in life. There seems to be a consensus among psy chologists of religion that meaning is the tie by which a healthy religious outlook integrates the personality and connects it to the larger world. Para doxically, this meaning must extend beyond egocentric concerns if such meaning is to be most personally satisfying. Schweiker states that religion performs a socio-psychological integrative function for the religiously com mitted individual by "organizing the individual's experience in terms of ulti mate meanings that include but also transcend the individual."53 Similarly, Anderson states that "if our religion is of a healthy kind, it will have some</page><page sequence="12">96 Journal of Religion and Health transcendental meaning, some relationship to the purpose for life."54 In other words, healthy religion becomes a point of reference that not only provides guidance for one's decisions and actions in all spheres of life but also infuses one with a sense of meaning and purpose as well. 10. Mature religious faith is not dependent upon a particular dogma, set of practices, or formal religious structure. A transcendent faith does not mean that theological doctrine is necessarily absent. However, doctrine, when cen tral to one's religious commitment, provides the foundation but not the es sence of one's faith. Although the religiously mature may be committed to, and behave in accordance with, a particular theological system, they sub scribe to their beliefs with a tentativeness and openness to diverse viewpoints that allow them to reach continually beyond their faith structure for ideas that may complement, expand, or revise their spiritual understanding.55 Summary and conclusions Faith is a complex and integral part of religiously committed persons. Its developmental ascendency within the religious individual parallels epigene tic theories of psychosocial, moral, ego, and cognitive theories of human de velopment. The schema presented in this article expands existing faith devel opment models by incorporating and organizing insights from psychodynamic psychology and object relations theory. The primary purpose of this synthesis and reconceptualization is to assist psychotherapists in more fully under standing the religiously committed patient by providing a conceptual frame work that illuminates the intrapsychic as well as the psychosocial develop mental disturbances underlying unhealthy adult religious functioning. In addition, criteria for mature religious functioning, as summarized from the literature on religious maturity, are listed to assist clinicians in discriminat ing a healthy from an unhealthy religious orientation. It is implied that religious functioning is interdependent and generally con gruent with other facets of a person's personality.56 Therefore, attention to the patient's religiousness provides important clues to the patient's overall psy chological functioning, thereby suggesting therapeutic goals appropriate to the individual's particular conflicts and level of maturity. Perhaps the model's main contribution is its heuristic value. The stages presented here encompass some, but certainly not all of the theoretical possi bilities. This conceptual merger is a beginning attempt to organize within a more precise and comprehensive theoretical framework the psychological dy namics involved in various types of adult religious functioning. Although less expedient for didactic and conceptual clarity, religious devel opment may be more appropriately understood as points along a continuum rather than discrete, clearly defined levels or stages.57 Thus, other theoreti</page><page sequence="13">Vicky Genia 97 cians and clinicians may observe, identify, and describe additional develop mental markers that lie between or overlap with the stages presented here. Description of these stages may also be enriched by elaborating variations of the dynamics involved within each developmental level and by integrating insights from other areas of psychology (that is, social and community psy chology, behavioral psychology, and so on). Furthermore, because develop ment progresses unevenly, the stages cannot be viewed as mutually exclusive categories. Elements from several stages may be observed in the religious functioning of any single individual. This is especially true of the last two stages, in which there is considerable overlap. Ultimately, it is one's predomi nant mode of psychospiritual functioning that distinguishes an individual at a particular level of development. Each individual is shaped by a complex interaction of constitutional, psy chological, emotional, familial, and socio-cultural influences and, as such, ex periences and presents his or her own unique spirituality. Furthermore, reli gious faith is by nature a uniquely personal phenomenon that defies precise measurement, scientific examination, and psychological understanding. How ever, while recognizing the incompleteness and limitations of descriptive "pi geonholes," the advantages of having a conceptual model may outweigh its disadvantages if the model is flexibly employed as a guideline for under standing adult religious functioning and not as an absolute standard to be rigidly applied to all religious persons in all situations. Although the stages presented here are generally congruent with other de velopmental models and build upon existing theoretical conceptualizations, this schema should be regarded as a tentative framework to be modified and revised in light of future research. Qualitative methods such as case studies, semistructured interviews, and use of autobiographical and psychohistorical materials seem an especially fruitful avenue for further inquiry into religious development58 and appear to be attracting a resurgence of interest among religious researchers.59 In addition, more refined psychometric measures of religious maturity may prove useful in comparative and longitudinal studies.
