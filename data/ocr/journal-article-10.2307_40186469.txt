Analysis of the use of this writing can be aided by classifying writing by types such as expressive, poetic, trans- actional, empiricist and contingent. The status of chemistry teaching within the writing across the curriculum movement indicates that writing is important in teaching chemistry and that a range of writing including not only transactional but also expressive writing should be ap- plied. Transactional writing such as laboratory reports and formal term papers has been used in chemistry teaching for a long time and its importance is unquestioned. Part of the value of expressive writing is that it can provide communication within the classroom and involve the students in the course. In-class writing is an example of this. In-class writing is described in some detail along with suggestions for its successful use. KEY WORDS: Writing-aaoss-the-curricuium; in-class writing; scientific writing. INTRODUCTION Writing has traditionally had a role in the teach- ing of chemistry, and this role is increasing as evi- denced by recent publications. In addition to expansion of this role, the type of writing used is also evolving from the traditional transactional writing of papers, reports and laboratory notebooks to include the more expressive writing of informal assignments and personal journals. The development of expres- sive writing in chemistry teaching significantly en- larges the possibilities of what can be accomplished by using writing in chemistry courses. I will examine the pertinent types of writing and then review the uses to which these types of writing have been put in chemistry teaching. The question of student and faculty acceptance of increased writing and more di- verse writing in chemistry classes will then be ad- dressed. CLASSIFICATION OF WRITING USED IN TEACHING Although writing has always been a part of the learning process, the movement of renewed emphasis on writing in education called writing-across-the-cur- riculum (Bizzell and Herzberg, 1986) developed in the 1960s (Barnes et aly 1968). A key aspect of this work (Britton et al, 1975) was the classification of writing so that the types of student writing could be discussed and evaluated in terms of specific uses. Britton and his co-workers proposed a continuous range of writing having "transactional writing" and "poetic writing" on the extremes of a continuum with "expressive writing" in the middle of the range. At one extreme, transactional writing is writing intended to get something done such as informing, advising, instructing and persuading. This kind of writing is not an end in itself but rather a means to achieving a desired end. In Britton's terminology, the writer and reader are taking participatory roles in transactional writing in that they are involved in the actual expe- riences for which the writing is intended such as in- forming and becoming informed or convincing and becoming convinced. Student writing that has the purpose of convincing a teacher of the student's mas- JDepartment of Chemistry, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, Massachusetts 01609. 259 1O594)145/9M)9(XM)259S15.(XM) C 1998 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">260 tery of required material would be included within this category. At the other extreme is poetic writing where lan- guage is used as an art medium, and the writing is an end in itself. A sample of this kind of writing is an object made out of language or a 'Verbal con- struct" and the pattern of the writing in terms of sounds, feelings, events and ideas is carefully chosen to produce an artful and tightly coherent whole. In poetic writing the writer and reader are spectators of the writing, according to Britton's terminology, since no outside purpose is intended. In so far as this writing has a purpose it is to please the writer and allow the reader to share in this pleasure. Between these two extremes is expressive writ- ing. In expressive writing the roles of participant and spectator are not clearly separable. The audience for expressive writing is a person with knowledge and values similar to the writer and can, in fact, simply be the writer's self. Expressive writing is much like casual speech in which the speaker is sharing feelings and experiences with a friend. Examples of expres- sive writing where the writer is the actual audience are "thinking aloud on paper" and writing entries into a diary or journal. An example akin to friendly conversation would be a letter to a relation or ac- quaintance. The interplay in expressive writing be- tween participant and spectator is important. A description of an activity from the past where the writer and reader have spectator roles can switch over to participant roles if the writer then draws on the experience to give a little advice. According to Britton, expressive writing is the initial form of writ- ing that young people use before they are sufficiently experienced to branch off into the transactional and poetic forms. However, the transactional form is by far the most widely used form of student writing (Ap- pleby, 1981). An important aspect of the work on the use of writing in teaching is stressing the educational ad- vantages of using writing in a full range of ways (Martin et aL, 1976). It has been suggested by Mof- fett (1969, 1981), who envisions a continuum of speech and writing, that maximizing the effect of lan- guage in learning is effected by beginning with modes closest to the student's own informal oral expression (expressive writing) and then moving to more formal abstract modes (transactional and poetic). Emig (1971), however, feels that writing is special and stresses the particular learning advantages of writing including imagining the audience and the effective Beall reinforcement of understanding by involving the eye, the brain and the hand. She emphasizes the function of the written text to allow reflection and revision and sees writing as the central means to establish and distribute knowledge. Emig advocates that students be given more opportunity to write expressively or "reflexively" as she calls it. Further developments of the writing-across-the- curriculum movement involved defining the uses of writing in education, particularly, teaching academic discourse or writing as it is done in the particular field of study (writing-in-the-discipline), and writing to increase comprehension and retention of concepts (writing-to-learn). Tfcaching the disciplinary discourse has been identified as the means of showing students the relationships among facts in the particular disci- pline (Van Nostrand, 1979). Maimon and her col- leagues (Maimon et aL, 1981) have provided a textbook for a freshman interdisciplinary program emphasizing academic discourse. The use of expres- sive writing rather than academic discourse as a means of writing-to-learn has also received attention, for example in the writing by students of personal journals (Fulwiler, 1980). More recent studies of writing across the cur- riculum have tended to merge writing-to-learn and writing-in-the-discipline and emphasize the need for both transactional and expressive writing. It is argued that conventions of discourse cannot be separated from learning (Blazerman, 1980). The use of expres- sive writing as a means of establishing and maintain- ing student-teacher dialogue or communication has also been emphasized (Knobloch and Brandon, 1983). A way of looking at scientific writing has been offered by Gilbert and Mulkay (1984). They describe the empiricist and contingent representations of sci- entific action as the two ways in which it is possible for scientists to write. The empiricist representation is the language of experimental research papers. It is an impersonal style that minimizes explicit mention of actual people and their beliefs. This style gives the impression of objectivity; often, opposing perspec- tives are ignored or presented in a way that empha- sizes their inadequacy compared to the factual character of the author's results. The generally false impression of detached observation presented in the empiricist representation gives the impression that no other interpretation other than the author's is worthy of serious consideration.</page><page sequence="3">Expanding the Scope of Writing in Chemical Education The contingent representation is excluded from formal scientific discourse; it is, however, a reason- able description of the way that scientists actually speak to each other. In this representation the ob- jectivity is contingent on uncertainties in the data and the interpretation and other conflicting but possibly correct points of view. In this representation the sci- entists involved are real people allowed normal prejudices and the potential of ordinary human error. There are clearly different ways of classifying writing about science. Thus we cannot really expect to find any system that will work easily and without ambiguity. However, considering how these view- points are similar and different can be useful in evaluating how writing can be used in teaching sci- ence. The empiricist representation of Gilbert and Mulkay parallels the transactional form of Britton in that it ostensibly functions to inform and subtly func- tions to persuade. The impersonal and apparently objective nature of the empiricist representation has become a tradition in scientific writing, but it is use- ful in providing the writer with a format that is highly compelling, particularly to a reader who is not fully familiar with other conflicting theories and interpre- tations. The contingent representation in scientific dis- course is a mixture of transactional and expressive modes of writing. Here the purpose of informing is still present but persuasion is less important in a form of discourse that allows for admissions of un- certainty and frank expressions of personal opinion. There is no doubt that the strong tradition of the empiricist representation in scientific writing has the favor of many practitioners in the field who can- not imagine writing science in any other way. Many of the writing programs that will be described in sub- sequent sections of this article will be aimed at teach- ing chemistry students to write papers and reports in the style of model papers in the literature. Further- more, most chemistry teachers are more comfortable grading student writing that is in the style of the em- piricist representation not only because it is a style with which they are very familiar, but also because it appears to free the teacher from any subjective judgements about the content or nature of the writ- ing. In my further discussion of student writing I will continue with Britton's classification of transactional and expressive writing with the important considera- tion that a continuum exists between these two modes, and writing blending the two modes is not 2(1 only possible but common. I will not consider poetic writing as an important mode of writing about chem- istry. WRITING IN CHEMISTRY AND CHEMICAL EDUCATION As part of the writing across the curriculum movement, the use of writing in the teaching of chemistry has developed and increased in recent years. A useful annotated bibliography on the teach- ing of writing in college chemistry between 1980 and 1990 has appeared (Shires, 1991). This bibliography also includes a list of useful source books on writing for the chemistry teacher. Chemistry, along with the other sciences is a writing intensive subject. As stated by Latour and Woolgar (1986). "Scientists are almost compulsive writers constantly writing in their note- books as well as writing notes, memos, directions, pa- pers and proposals." The importance of writing in the teaching of chemistry has always been recognized regarding academic discourse. This recognition has been particularly evident in the laboratory where stu- dents have always kept laboratory records and writ- ten laboratory reports. Discussions of concept learning as opposed to problem solving bear on the use of writing in chem- istry. There appears to be overwhelming evidence that students can learn how to solve problems with- out actually understanding the concepts that are in- volved (Yarroch, 1985; Nurrenbern and Pickering, 1987; Gabel et aLt 1987; Sawrey, 1990). Furthermore, the solving of conceptual problems can be taught (Pickering, 1990). The use of writing, which tends by its very nature to involve thinking and understanding, should contribute to concept comprehension. Lyth- cott has tested a procedure where students must de- scribe a problem to be solved in basic English before going on to chemical and mathematical language and symbols (Lythcott, 1990). This redescription of a problem in qualitative terms had previously been suggested by Reif (1983). Strauss and Fuftviler (1989) have stated the im- portance of student involvement in large lecture courses without which they state that the lectures have little value (Strauss and Fulwiler, 1989). 'tech- niques that they have used to produce this involve- ment include (1) having the students keep personal logs on course concerns, (2) establishing lab work- shops where groups of students create questions for</page><page sequence="4">262 upcoming exams and (3) having them write down anonymous questions before, during and after lec- tures. Some of these questions can be shown and ex- plained to the class in subsequent lectures. Writing in chemical education is also pertinent to Perry's (1979) model of intellectual development. In this model the student progresses towards more complex and sophisticated learning patterns through steps defined as dualistic, multiplistic, relative and contextually relative. Movement through this learn- ing scheme is fostered by teaching at a level about one step above that at which the students are oper- ating. Finster (1991) postulates that most general chemistry students are between the dualistic stage where truth is absolute and human knowledge is complete and the early multiplistic stage where un- certainties exist and truth is debatable. They are thus ready to be introduced to a more complex view of chemistry than algorithms for problem solving and definitions simply to be memorized. Finster advo- cates writing, particularly of the expressive nature, to help advance the students in this learning scheme. His writing suggestions include personal journals and term papers that allow the student to think about the difficulties and approaches involved in chemistry and not just examine the science from the body-of-knowl- edge viewpoint. This "thinking about thinking" ap- peals to the student working at the multiplistic level and encourages growth in this direction. Ifro basic conclusions appear from this brief analysis: (1) that writing is an important part of chemistry and should appear in the curriculum, and (2) that the use of expressive writing appears to drive the educational process in chemistry toward deeper and more sophisticated understanding. I will now consider developments in the use of writing in chemi- cal education starting with transactional applications. TRANSACTIONS WRITING IN CHEMICAL EDUCATION It is reasonable to assume that any writing as- signed in a chemistry course is intended to assist the learning process in some way. 'Ransactional writing in chemical education will be defined as writing for which there is a specific purpose in addition to as- sisting in learning even though this additional pur- pose may be simulated. Thus, writing a laboratory report for a well-defined laboratory exercise is a simulation of an actual research report and is an ex- Beall ample of transactional writing. Examples of transac- tional writing will also include written answers to ex- aminations, reports of literature searches, summaries of lectures, abstracts of journal articles, term papers, journal-style papers, descriptions of problem solving methods and problems requiring detailed written an- swers. Early papers on writing in chemical education emphasized transactional writing as done in the dis- cipline. In 1920, Watt (1920) discussed the methods and problems of making technical students better writers and 23 years later Wall (1943) stressed the importance of writing in chemical education. McKaig (1963) introduced technical writing into a freshman chemistry program in 1963. More recently, Switzer (1978) gave hints for good technical writing for chemistry students, and several other authors have pointed out weaknesses in student writing and pub- lished instructions for chemistry students on good technical writing (Stacy, 1976; Zimmerman, 1978; Smith, 1988; Potera, 1984). A number of other examples of teaching trans- actional writing in chemistry have been reported since 1980. Melhado (1980, 1981) described a one- semester course for teaching literature searching and writing skills for students in chemistry, biochemistry and chemical engineering. This elective course in- cluded computer searches of the literature and a va- riety of writing assignments including short answers, term papers and in-class writing and also included revisions. The use of written summaries of organic chemistry lectures has been described by Steiner (1982). Students who wrote good summaries were observed to do better on the exams indicating a cor- relation between writing and understanding. The weaknesses in the technical writing of chemistry students have been catalogued by Burkett and Dunkel (1983). The principal problems are seen to be literature searches, avoiding plagiarism, organi- zation, synthesizing information, and rewriting. They suggest the use of peer tutoring and a writing center and emphasize that chemistry faculty must not accept inferior writing by students. The expertise of an Eng- lish professor has been utilized by Bailey and Mark- owitz to provide a set of standards for the rhetoric and diction of laboratory reports in instrumental analysis (Bailey and Markowitz, 1983). Goodman and Bean (1983) described an in-house journal, which was created to publish the best of student laboratory reports as judged by a peer group editors.</page><page sequence="5">Expanding the Scope of Writing in Chemical Education Olmstead (1984) has staled the need for chem- ists to be able to communicate with different kinds of audiences and has required students to write labo- ratory reports for advanced undergraduate labora- tory in a number of different styles ranging from a popular science article to a journal article. Writing assignments for all chemistry courses have been ad- vocated by Powell (1985) who has assigned abstracts of journal articles, concept papers and project papers and reviewed (but did not grade) laboratory and lec- ture notes in organic chemistry class. Lecture summaries, graded for content and writ- ing, were used by an experimental group of students in a general chemistry course (Horton et aL9 1985). Exam results were better for students in the experi- mental group than the control group, which did not write the summaries. Yoxheimer (1986) has reported assigning journal article summaries in technical courses and student writing of annotated abstracts of journal articles has been described by Foos (1987). Atkinson (1986) has incorporated a 10 to 15 page paper into a second year instrumental analysis course for chemistry majors. He maintains that stu- dent response to this assignment is positive if it is made clear that good technical writing is a career ne- cessity. The use of lab reports written in scientific journal format has been described by Werner (1986). Computer-assisted instruction to aid students in writ- ing laboratory reports has been described by Tfemple- ton and Lorenz (1986). Problems in upper division laboratory reports have been discussed by Rosenthal (1987), who points out, particularly, the difficulty the students have in using data to substantiate the assertions that are given. Shifting the audience from the all-knowing teacher to a hypothetical but knowledgeable peer is suggested as a remedy for the problem. This would be an example of moving the writing from transac- tional to more expressive. The tendency of students to think about operations and theory separately has been discussed by Warren and Pickering (1987), who suggest embedding the details of the theory in the laboratory report to cement theory with operations in the student's mind. Student writing of laboratory reports modeled on journal styles has been reinforced by the use of graduate students in language, literature and commu- nication as writing consultants (Bailey and Giesler, 1991). This system frees the chemistry faculty from reading the initial drafts and allows the input of an 2(3 experienced evaluator of writing style on the non- chemical aspects of the students' writing. The use of questions in chemistry exams requir- ing that the students employ suitable English has been described by Meislich (1987). In this program a writing instructor is available to help with rewriting and thus raise grades on poorly written answers con- taining substantially correct chemistry. The writing of "interesting" term papers from the chemical literature has been required of fresh- man students in a small class by Sherman (1988). An expressive aspect was included in that the students were asked to give opinions of the papers that they were using as sources. However, these opinions were normally naive and accepting, for example, "the pa- per was well written, covered the subject well, and was easy to read after one had learned the vocabu- lary." \fenOrden (1987, 1990) has described the use of brief writing assignments where the students are re- quired to solve a problem and then explain, discuss or apply the results. More recently, she has per- formed comparative studies with a control group of students assigned standard end-of-chapter exercises and an experimental group assigned problems that included transactional writing and critical thinking. The students in the experimental group showed steady improvement with time and scored better on quizzes even though the quizzes were very similar to die exercises done by the control group. Although the assignments for the experimental group were more time consuming, student levels of satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) regarding the homework assign- ments were the same for each group. Writing-to-learn has been used in an organic chemistry course by Wilson (1994). He reports that most of the students thought that the writing assign- ments were useful. Inclusion of Expressive Writing and Informal Writing into Chemical Education Expressive writing is a blend of writing for a pur- pose and writing for its own sake. In general, expres- sive writing is intended for the writer's self or for a sympathetic audience with values and experience rea- sonably similar to those of the writer. Writing done in informal settings can generally be considered ex- pressive writing since the writing-thinking process it- self is the principal purpose. Informal writing is</page><page sequence="6">264 written quickly with no significant opportunity for re- vision. The writing of the student's own opinions for a teacher in a chemistry class can be generally con- sidered expressive, contraiy to writing on a objective scientific topic, since the student probably does not have a preconceived notion of specifically what the teacher expects. Examples of expressive writing in- clude informal or in-class writing, essays dwelling on the student's relationship to the subject, writing for suggestion boxes and personal student journals. The evolution of expressive writing into chemi- cal education has greatly lagged transactional writing. A course in scientific writing for undergraduates in science having both transactional and expressive as- pects was described in 1977 (Carlisle and Kinsinger). In 1982, Pyle and Trammel commented that labora- tory reports, the only universally accepted writing ac- tivity in undergraduate chemistry, fail to develop organization and imagination because of the struc- tured format. They reported having students write "contemporary chemical essays" that were required to contain the writer's own conclusions on complex or controversial issues in which chemistry was in- volved. Finster (1985) has assigned term papers for second semester general chemistry students that em- phasize the student's own thoughts on the chemistry involved. Tbpics included for these papers have in- cluded societal dilemmas involving science where an- swers are not clear. The classroom suggestion box provides an op- portunity for informal, expressive writing about a course. The use of such a device and the incorpora- tion of relevant questions and comments in sub- sequent classes has been described by Strauss and Fuhviler (1987). Writing of term papers on current topics allows the student the freedom to write ex- pressively if he or she desires (McHale, 1994). The topics of informal writing used in the chem- istry classroom can tend toward either the transac- tional or the expressive. Thall and Bays (1989) reported using ungraded, in-class writing as prepara- tion for essay questions in examinations. An example of one of their more transactional questions is, "Based on the lab boiling point determination, ex- plain why the capillary tube was needed and the sig- nificance of (the) steady stream of bubbles." Here the information to be conveyed and the way that it will be judged are clear. One of their more expressive questions is, "What has been the greatest intellectual achievement of the 20th Century?" In this case the student is allowed more freedom to discuss according Beall to his or her own viewpoint and the audience, al- though still the teacher, will probably be more toler- ant of diverse answers. A question with both transactional and expressive aspects is, "Discuss the Ideal Gas Law. Be sure to include description of, sig- nificance of, and its impact on chemistry." They re- ferred to this writing as "unstructured" since the writing time was brief and there was no opportunity for revision. Thus this writing functions similarly to thinking out loud, which would put it in the category of expressive writing. The benefits they see from these writing assignments are improving the students' writing skill along with their ability to think (Emig, 1977). Thall and Bays used instructor's versions of the written answers to reinforce the student versions. Beall (1991) reported using informal in-class writing as a means of improving comprehension and communication. Again the questions themselves bridged between the transactional and the expressive. A transactional example is, "Summarize the results of Rutherford's experiment with alpha particles aimed at metal foils. How did this lead to the theory of the nuclear atom?" while a more expressive mode example is, "Describe one property of matter or one process involving matter that you would like to un- derstand better." Enhanced learning of concepts is a major aim of this program. In addition, Beall de- scribed selecting student writings to show to the class during the next meeting. This is claimed to open a channel of communication among the students and the instructor which is not normally possible in the large classroom situation. The nature of the question on a particular topic for in-class writing, whether transactional or expres- sive, can depend on the wording. The following ques- tions examine the same subject matter but one is more transactional whereas the other is more expres- sive. • Transactional wording: Express in your own words why the law of definite proportions leads to the atomic theory. • Expressive wording: Do you think that the law of definite proportions leads logically to the atomic theory? Explain why or why not. In the first wording the student is clearly being asked to repeat, although, perhaps, in his or her own terms, a concept that was stated in lecture and the textbook. There is a clear outside purpose in the writing and that is to convince the teacher that the concept is understood. Furthermore, the wording of</page><page sequence="7">Expanding the Scope of Writing in Chemical Education the question leaves no doubt that the law of definite proportions actually does lead to the atomic theory; it is simply a matter of the student stating the con- nection. In the second wording the student is asked to take his or her own view of the subject matter and give a personal reaction to it. Phrasing the ques- tion in the expressive form invites a much wider range of answers, for example, Absolutely not I don't see any relation between the two. The atomic theory is also on a different level from the law of definite proportions. The law of definite proportions talks about large amounts that are much greater compared to the atomic theory. By the expressive phrasing of the question, the teacher has learned something about this student's level of understanding that would not have been probed by the standard transactional wording. It is clear that this student in nowhere near grasping a fundamental purpose of chemistry, which is the con- struction of microscopic models based on the mac- roscopic behavior that we can observe. In the following student writing for the expres- sively phrased question, the student has been able to go beyond the standard explanation given in class to a realization that the atomic theory is consistent with the law of definite proportions but is not really proved by it. The law of definite proportions does not lead di- rectly to the atomic theory, but it is a good indicator that atomic theory is valid. We know that in a given mass of a compound, a given ratio between the com- pound's constituents will exist; this was found through experimentation. No violations are known to occur, so we can assume it as fact. The most logi- cal way to "keep track" of these properties is to say that matter is quantized (exists in "chunks" so small that the division between them is unnoticeable) and that these chunks of matter somehow know, on an individual basis, how many of the other constituent chunks they need in order to form the compound. What these "chunks" consist of and HOW they know how to combine would be determined by later experimentation. The following two in-class writing exercises give another example of the wording of a question dic- tating the nature of the writing. Transactional wording: Explain the formal charge concept and why (not how) it is useful in de- ciding among possible Lewis structures of a com- pound. 265 More expressive wording: Write on the concept of formal charge considering the following ques- tions: • What is the formal charge concept? • What are its uses? • How important is it compared to other con- cepts we have studied in this course? The transactional wording leads the student to an explanation of a method of choosing among Lewis structures by a method that is already established as can be inferred by the wording of the question. The insistence that the question of "why" and not "how" the formal charge concept can be used does deflect the student from a pure recitation of the formal charge method to a consideration of why it is useful. However, the nature of the writing is essentially de- termined and is essentially transactional. For exam- ple, Formal charges are used when using the Lewis sys- tem of structures. It is assumed that bonding elec- trons are shared equally. The charge on a particular atom is placed there because the number of elec- trons is not equal to the valence number of elec- trons. It is useful because it shows which structures are not stable. For example, you can't have two posi- tives or two negatives next to each other. The range of answers to the transactionally worded question includes substantially correct an- swers such as the above and generally incorrect an- swers from students who simply did not understand the concept. The expressive wording of the question opens up the number of possibilities significantly. For example, . . . Formal charges are just a formality. In fact, they don't exist. They are just a help for us to find the right Lewis structure of a compound. Compared to other concepts in chemistry, formal charges are not so important but they are useful. Formal charge is a sort of imaginary concept in my viewpoint. It tells you what charge is on a certain atom in a compound at any one time. The formal charges must add up to zero in neutral compounds and ions must have their formal charges add up to their overall charge. Why is it an imaginary concept? Well, considering the speed that electrons move around in compounds, the atoms in the compound never really take the for- mal charge. (Well, maybe they do but only for a split instant.) It's sort of like the blades of a fan looking solid because the move so fast. Formal charge is use- ful because it allows us to figure out the most likely structures for compounds. It's fairly important be- cause formal charge is related to the polarity of molecules and thus affects the properties of the sub- stance.</page><page sequence="8">266 Thus the question of formal charge is opened to much more probing and exploring thought by the student giving the teacher a much clearer idea of what the students are thinking about and how they are relating to the material that has been presented. Expressive writing can also be used to set a "tone" for a class. As the beginning exercise for this year's freshman chemistry class, I projected the fol- lowing quotation by Chickering and Gamson (1987). Learning is not a spectator sport Students do not learn much just by sitting in class listening to teach- ers, memorizing pre-packaged assignments, and spit- ting out answers. They must talk about what they are learning, write about it, relate it to past experi- ences, apply it to their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of themselves. For their first in-class writing assignment, the students were asked, "What does this quote mean to you as a WPI student?" The overwhelming majority of the students expressed a positive reaction to the Chickering and Gamson quotation and, in effect, committed themselves to it in the writing that they handed in. As examples: Learning has become very mechanical. I've found in many high school classes, all that you really need to do is memorize equations the night before the test and then produce them as needed during the test. Of course, in approximately one day you will have completely forgotten what you memorized and really haven't learned anything. So it is important to talk and write about what you are trying to learn and really learn it and not just memorize it. Also, if you can relate what you're learning to real life you feel more comfortable with it and learning becomes eas- ier. This quote means that it takes a lot to really learn something. It means that to expect a teacher to hand a person an education is expecting far too much. One must work for what they truly want from a class. The teacher will tell a person the basics but to learn the in-depth part of a class one has to look for answers. A person needs to be open to the idea of digging and digging for the answer to a question. The teacher is a guide and not a crutch. However, the expressively worded question al- ways invites a range of answers, for example: This quote has with it a sense of doom for me, the average and somewhat lazy student. While I agree with the quote, I realize it means more brain power must be applied to utilize the material as the quote specifies. I find that sitting in class as a vegetable can be very relaxing, however, even if it means one does not get so much as possible out of a particular class. Beall As teachers, we would just as soon not have to deal with the attitude expressed by this last writer. However, this kind of attitude exists and it is, prob- ably, just as well to get some idea as to how many such attitudes we have. Furthermore, the student is clearly struggling with the conflict between what he or she would like to do and ought to do. Perhaps, expressing this conflict on paper may be a maturing step for this particular student It appears that the expressive wording of in-class writing assignments in chemistry, although not tradi- tional, provides a method of involving the student more deeply in the subject matter and stimulating a more profound level of student thought as well as providing additional information about the students for the teacher. Such writing can also be used for student motivation and setting classroom and learn- ing patterns. A key to the successful use of in-class writing is the selection of satisfactory questions for the student writing. A question is unsatisfactory when the writ- ings have not stimulated thoughtful answers, and the information the teacher gains about the class is very limited. To some extent question selection is a trial- and-error process with unsatisfactory questions being discarded and satisfactory questions being retained for subsequent use. However, a teacher wants to ask as few unsatisfactory questions as possible and to in- troduce some new questions each term. How can one predict how successful a question will be? 15 begin with, it is necessary to differentiate be- tween an in-class writing, in effect a very short and informal essay, and a short answer question. Expla- nation is necessary in an in-class writing and the question will normally include words like "why" or "how" or "explain" to allow the student to write freely. In-class writing deals with concepts, and if the question is in the form of a problem it is the rea- soning used to solve the problem that is paramount. Examples of short answer and in-class writing ques- tions on the same topic are: • Short answer: How do you calculate the bind- ing energy for a nucleus? • In-class writing: Explain why you might ex- pect every nucleus to fly apart and yet many nuclei do not? Stimulating student thinking also depends on the level of the question. A successful question should be pitched at the "frontier" of the students' understanding and be neither too difficult nor too</page><page sequence="9">Expanding the Scope of Writing in Chemical Education easy. A question that is too easy is given a quick and cursory answer with little thought applied, and a question that is too difficult is passed over with the feeling that only the omniscient teacher would know the answer to something like that. Hitting the correct level, of course, depends on knowing the level of the class. Depending on the class level, the following question might range anywhere between too difficult to too easy. Collisions between gas particles are assumed to be purely elastic in the kinetic theory of gases. Explain why you think this is reasonable or unreasonable. Answers or answer excerpts depending on the class level are: loo difficult: the gas particles are moving, but I don't really know what happens in collisions Reasonable frontier of understanding: The particles must be undergoing perfectly elastic collisions. Oth- erwise they would eventually stop moving, and the pressure would go to zero, and this isn't observed. But I'm not quite sure how this happens since all collisions I've ever seen are not perfectly elastic I think it might have something to do with the fact that particles move faster when the temperature is increased. Too easy: Of course it's reasonable because tempera- ture and speed are the same thing for atom sized particles. Madigan (1987) has used informal writing as- signments to increase the involvement of students in the subject matter. The students write nonstop for three minutes about a problem for which they must chose from among several possible solutions. The time involved for evaluation of the writing by the teacher is kept reasonable by responding to selected issues in the writings rather than actually grading them. In addition, faculty time is conserved by having the students perform self-evaluations of their own writing and evaluate each other's work. The use of student journals is an important form of expressive writing. Malachowski (1988) has used these in a liberal arts chemistry course. Tbpics in- cluded "Oil and Coal vs. Nuclear Power," "Greatest Discoveries of Past 100 Years" and "Creationism as Science." Student discussion of each other's writings was employed. Cooper (1993) has developed some imaginative writing projects that can be used in a large class set- ting. In one exercise she has the students write short notes that can be graded quickly on concepts they don't understand. In another exercise she has stu- dents exchange homework assignments and then 267 each student determines a concept the other did not understand and attempts to explain that concept in an effective and useful way. An important aspect of these exercises is that they communicate to the teacher what concepts are giving students problems. Such communication has been described by Beall (1993) who has used in-class writing to probe student misconceptions about thermodynamics. Reading assignments and out-of-class essay writ- ing on chemical topics have been used (Beall, 1993) in order to expand the viewpoint of chemistry com- monly held by students. Specific aims were to de- velop ability to read about science, to show how the various topics of chemistry are integrated and to de- pict chemistry as a vital and human endeavor. The themes of the readings generally led to expressive writing assignments and included probing the moti- vation that causes people to study science, interpre- tation of scientific results, the changing nature of what is accepted as truth, and scientific honesty and responsibility. Student writing of biographies in chemistry has been described by Finster (1992) who argues that an understanding of modern chemistry is facilitated by studying its development. Examples of writing to help memorizing and learning are writing autobiographies of the elements (VanOrden, 1988), limericks on organic name reac- tions (Ganem, 1990), and assignments where mole- cules are portrayed as people (Miller, 1992). A value of having the students write in more whimsical styles than usually encountered in science has been claimed by Burke (1995). STUDENT AND FACULTY ACCEPTANCE OF WRITING IN CHEMICAL EDUCATION Because writing is still developing as a part of chemical education, questions of acceptance of it by students and faculty are important. Stanislawski (1990) has polled the student reaction to formal writ- ing in the general chemistry course. He reports that 56 to 76% of students find the writing assignments useful and 15% felt that the writing helped in their course grade. About 37% responded that the writing took too much time but this complaint was lessened in a subsequent year when the writing was spread out into more frequent but shorter assignments. He con- cluded that students will accept writing in the chem- istry class if it is presented as an important com- ponent of their career preparation.</page><page sequence="10">268 Sunderwirth (1993) reports the student response to a chemistry course in which all of the exam ques- tions required answers in words and the lab required extensive writing. The principal statements of the stu- dents were (1) that the work load was too heavy, (2) that they didn't want to do English in a chemistry class and (3) that the writing helped with under- standing the chemistry and developing writing skills. Beall (1991) gave the results of a survey of stu- dent attitudes to in-class writing. He reported that 63% of the students responded in a positive way to the usefulness of in-class writing in helping to learn the chemistry; 13% gave responses indicating a resistance to the in-class writing; 14% gave a neutral or irrelevant response; 10% gave a re- sponse indicating that they found the in-class writ- ing to be a humiliating experience due to their feelings of inadequacy while doing the writing and when their writings were not chosen for subsequent showing to the class. This response of humiliation was reduced to only 1% in the succeeding year by a careful explanation at the beginning of the course of the purpose of the in-class writing (Beall, 1992). Beall and Thmbur (1993) have looked at the way in which the process of communication is changed in the large chemistry class when in-class writing is incorporated. In particular, they have interpreted the resistant responses to in-class writing in terms of Gofftnan's "underlife" concept (1961, 1963), which had already been applied to student writing (Brooke, 1987; Anderson et aly 1990). Underlife refers to be- havior that individuals adopt in order to demonstrate that they reject the role that is expected of them in their particular situation. For students in class, this ascribed or expected role is that of the interested, thoughtful receiver in the transmission of informa- tion from the teacher. Talking or passing messages to fellow students instead of listening to the teacher while writing lecture notes are examples of "con- tained" underlife. Much less common would be "dis- ruptive" underlife, which actually seeks to change the social structure. Underlife behavior in the in-class writing can be recognized in writing almost nothing, perfunctory an- swers, illegible script, jokes, vulgarities and making sarcastic personal comments about the instructor. It is most easily recognized when the resistance is stated clearly and openly, as in the following exam- ple. Beall In-class writing in chemistry is a most annoying thing. I really hate it when people try to think up things to try to make me think. True, writing in class does waste time and serve as a form of attendance taking. But I really can't think in lecture about con- cepts. That's why we're assigned homework: to apply the knowledge we've obtained from lecture, not ap- ply it in lecture. This is why writing in class in chem- istry is worthless and a pain in the ... well, you know. Most resistance of students to writing assign- ments in chemistry is, probably, a result of their un- familiarity with writing in the science environment. Thus, increasing the use of writing in the chemistry classroom should increase familiarity and acceptance by students. Faculty acceptance of the expanded use of writing in chemistry teaching is an important fac- tor in the slow increase of the use of writing as a tool in their classes. Faculty concerns include their insecurity in grading writing assignments, which are much more subjective than other assignments or ex- . ams. In addition there is their feeling that content will be sacrificed if more writing is included in chem- istry courses. In particular, the question of losing time for presenting chemistry content has been raised by Labianca and Reeves (1985), who also note that chemistry teachers are not trained to teach good writing and that writing in the sciences is "not the same" as in the humanities. The question of time lost for presenting chemistry content has also been an- swered by Atkinson (1986) who responded that using writing to improve the learning skills of the students allows them to do more learning outside of the lec- ture hall thus increasing the content that they actu- ally retain. Meislich (1987) has responded to the notion that chemistry teachers are not trained to teach writing by saying that chemistry teachers do not need to teach good writing but simply shouldn't ac- cept poor writing. Bizzell and Hertzberg (1986) discuss faculty de- velopment in the use of writing across the curriculum and the concern of time being taken from what is con- sidered essential course content. Practical advice on getting a writing across the curriculum program started has been given by Maimon (1980, 1981). Madigan (1987) has also addressed faculty skepticism about writing across the curriculum and the extra time taken to grade student writings. He supports writing across the curriculum principally to increase course content and secondarily to improve writing skills.</page><page sequence="11">Expanding the Scope of Writing in Chemical Education SUMMARY Writing is an important tool in the chemistry class and its use should be expanded. Chemistry is a writing intensive subject and the importance of dis- cipline specific writing in chemistry has always been recognized. However, the use of writing in chemistry should be broadened to include expressive writing as well as the traditional transactional writing that has been included in the chemistry curriculum for many years, particularly in the instructional laboratory. In addition, informal writing can be valuable. The value of expressive writing as a teaching tool has been pointed out in the writing-across-the-cur- riculum movement and in work of some chemistry teachers. Progress is being made and this form of writing is slowly making its way into some under- graduate chemistry courses.
