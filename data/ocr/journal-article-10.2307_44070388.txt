<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANDREW MCMURRY "In Their Own Language" Sarah Orne Jewett and the Question of Non-human Speaking Subjects Working at my brother's fish processing operation on the northern Great Lakes entailed long hours on the " slime line," the steel slaughter bench on which we by turns scaled , de-finned, gutted, and filleted endless tons offish, some so fresh they were, as we would say, " still wiggling ." There was generally little talk on the slime line, but occasionally some- body might make a remark about the objects of our attentions. One man would frequently muse that if fish could scream, we would not be able to proceed with our job. (Whether he found it amusing to say this or whether it was part of a religious idée fixe - he was a lapsed Sev- enth-Day Adventist - I do not know.) My brother, who is deft with the fillet knife and thus worked from what was called the "head boner" position, would respond with an equally predicable rejoinder. You see this" he would say, holding up a slab of whitefish, "this is a unit." "Unit"- a word calculated to conjure up images of interchangeable machined parts and suspend all thoughts of the fish as a once-living creature. A few times, some rather large channel catfish came into the shop and, being a particularly hardy species, managed to thrash around for a good long time on the table before we decapitated them (and often even afterwards). Maybe it is a trick of memory, but I seem to remember that they did emit a low croak when the knife was inserted into their throats.</page><page sequence="2">52 ISLE Jewett and Ecocriticism Sarah Orne Jewett, the nineteenth-century New England "regionalist," has enjoyed a minor renaissance of late, in large measure due, accord- ing to biographer Elizabeth Silverthorne, to her early work on women's issues and her pioneering indictment of ecologically destructive prac- tices. She was an influence, for example, on Theodore Roosevelt, who counted her as a source for his progressive political philosophy. "The world today," writes Silverthorne, "is finally catching up with some [her] main concerns" (9). What are those concerns? Willa Cather said, "Miss Jewett wrote of the people who grew out of the soil and the life of the country near her heart, not about exceptional individuals at war with their environment" (xv-xvi). We will begin, then, with the gen- eral observation that Jewetťs novels, stories, and essays about the quo- tidian visits, conversations, day-trips, charities, and celebrations of the unremarkable people inhabiting the Maine shore reveal her preoccu- pation with the possibilities of local knowledge. She suggests that in our everyday associations with others and our surroundings we find the basis for what might today be termed "sustainable" living. Jewett finds that as the familiarity with place deepens, the attachment takes on unexpected dimensions. She frequently suggests that relations with places, landscapes, and animals may be compared with relations be- tween persons; that, for example, places are much like persons in their capacity to elicit love, attention, and concern for their well-being. As she puts it in her major novel, The Country of the Pointed Firs (1925), "When one really knows a village like this and its surroundings, it is like becoming acquainted with a single person. The process of falling in love at first sight is as final as it is swift, but the growth of true friendship may be a lifelong affair" (47). In her fascination with place Jewett confirms her continuity with her chief philosophical influences, Henry Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, both of whom contribute to her environmental sensibility: Thoreau by way of his method of closely "reading" natural environ- ments and Emerson as the theorist of linkages between such environ- ments and a putative transcendent one. This continuity is suggested as early as her first novel, Deephaven (1877). The plot here, as with most of Jewetťs tales, is largely non-existent, in the sense that the novel un- folds in a series of linked sketches, stories, and portraits filtered through a narrator. (This "ethnographical" approach to writing, by the way, is the hallmark of Jewetťs regional realism, generating a fictive dynamic dependent on thick description rather than narratival progression.) One evening, after hearing a compelling story from a certain "Captain</page><page sequence="3">"In Their Own Language " 53 Sands/' the narrator and her friend Kate discuss the kinds of knowl- edge possessed by "simple country people," who are "so much nearer to nature than people who live in cities" (130). The narrator wonders if country people are not unconsciously awed by the strength and purpose in the world about them, and the mysterious creative power which is at work with them on their familiar farms. In their simple life they take as their instincts for truths, and perhaps they are not always so far wrong as we imagine. Because they are so instinctive and unreasoning, they may hear her voices when wiser ears are deaf. They have much in common, after all, with the plants which grow up out of the ground, and the wild creatures which depend on their instincts wholly. (130-31) This passage reverberates with Jewett's sincere admiration for the coun- try people, their autochthonous relationship with nature venerated through her use of classic pastoral imagery. Her companion Kate con- tinues in a similar vein, noting that the more one lives out of doors the more personality there seems to be in what we call inanimate things. The strength of the hills and the voice of the waves are no longer only grand poetical sentences, but an expression of something real, and more and more one finds God himself in the world, and believes we may read the thoughts that He writes for us in the book of Nature. (131) Despite Jewett's unrestrained enthusiasm for her subject, both pas- sages remind us of the risks inherent in the romantic view of nature: country people, praised for their blissful and arcane knowledge of na- ture, are enabled by their "unreasoning," by their homey proximity to animals and plants, and by their sheer simplicity of motives, to per- ceive in nature what more rational, "citified" minds cannot. Implicit in this line of thought, then, is a devaluation of both nature and those - women, aboriginals, children, "country people" - who are condescend- ingly considered to be specially endowed with "instinctual," animalian knowledge. Furthermore, while one might agree with Kate that the direct experience of nature could lead to its greater appreciation, at the same time her elevation of nature to symbol remains a troublesome feature of the Transcendentalists' view of the material world. Such a view can all too easily countenance nature's ruthless appropriation for the more concrete - if ultimately less "real" (in the Transcendentalists' hierarchy) - purpose of turning nature into commodity, especially when, as Emerson acknowledges, even this "mercenary benefit is one which has respect to a farther good" (13).</page><page sequence="4">54 ISLE But there is another thematic preoccupation previewed in these pas- sages, one that suggests interesting parallels between Jewett's work and contemporary environmental philosophy. Jewett refers to "her voices" and the "voice of the waves": indeed, in many of her works she uses similar figures to register the possibility of non-human speech. My point will be that her fixation with a "talking nature" created for her some of the same problems that recent attempts to construe na- ture as a "speaking subject" create for those engaged in ecocriticism in general and ecofeminism in particular. Now, the most obvious prob- lem here might seem to be that animals, plants, and landscapes sim- ply do not speak; such semiotic activity as they may engage in is not of the sort we generally recognize as coming under the rubric of "speech." Yet, as Christopher Manes argues, this is only because "Na- ture is silent in our culture (and in literate societies generally) in the sense that the status of being a speaking subject is jealously guarded as an exclusively human prerogative" (339). In response to that kind of speciesist gate-keeping, some animal rights theorists, environmen- tal ethicists, deep ecologists, and ecofeminists believe that expanding the domain of the "speaking subject" is a vitally important goal, one that would allow the taking into account of non-humans' "interests" in a world in which their accelerated exploitation seems not only likely but assured. Nothing short of a radical redrawing of the bounds of subjectivity will have any chance at slowing or halting our overween- ing anthropocen-trism. Rhetorically adopting such an enlarged per- spective, Marti Kheel writes, "Nature is telling us in myriad ways that we cannot continue to poison her rivers, forests and streams, that she is not invulnerable, and that the violence and abuse must stop. Na- ture is speaking to us. The question is whether we are willing or able to hear" (260). Similarly, Josephine Donovan avers, "We should not kill, eat, torture, and exploit animals because they do not want to be so treated, and we know that. If we listen , we can hear them" (185, my emphasis). In effect, what is sought by these theorists in their chal- lenge to the silencing of nature is a new conceptual mode that renders unthinkable the hierarchic reductionism reflected in the dualisms of subject/object, nature/culture, man/woman, or reason/feeling. Such dualisms, so it is believed, have enabled us to imagine animals as machines, women as sub-humans, emotion as weakness, wilderness as a place presently understocked with "mankind," and nature in gen- eral as merely a substrate for relentless human development. By in- corporating non-humans into the common wealth of speaking subjects, ecofeminists and their allies work toward the elimination of dualistic thinking and the pitiless culture of domination that such thinking pre- sumably inculcates.</page><page sequence="5">"In Their Own Language " 55 But what precisely is entailed in claiming that "nature speaks/' or that, conversely, we have silenced it? How does one render the non- human into a specifically speaking subject without falling prey to vari- ous forms of anthropomorphism, idealism, or Romanticism? Are there any perils in using ¿lis kind of rhetoric to further the laudable goals of ecofeminists and others? My view is that in the attempt to construe nature as voiceless and in need of speaking subject status we do in- deed play a dangerous game. The first danger is that an ethics which depends on such speaking subjects to enunciate their interests too of- ten puts the onus of auditory responsibility (as we have briefly noted above) directly on those special categories of "listeners" - such as na- tives, "country people," women, children - who have long been con- structed as somehow more receptive to the voice of nature than the rest of humanity. This responsibility is not altogether salutary, given that "close to nature" is very often synonymous with "distant from culture" (i.e., ignorant, primitive, or worse). Related to this problem, a second danger is that by engaging the speech /silence opposition ecofeminists and others actually reinscribe their discourse into the same dominant Western metaphysical tradition that has conserved itself in part precisely by privileging speech as the most immediate pathway to presence, "Truth," or the "Real" - the tradition, ironically, which in most other ways they seek only to demolish. Lastly, the idea of confer- ring speaking subjectivity on non-humans is motivated by a "phonocentric" fallacy that leads directly to Hans Duerr 's dubious and dangerously simplistic conclusion that "people do not exploit a nature that speaks to them" (quoted in Manes 340). My goal in the rest of this essay is to illustrate these dangers using the example of Jewett, with the goal being to undermine neither ecofeminist theory or her early contributions but simply to question the efficacy and prudence of pur- suing this "speaking subject" approach to extending ethical consider- ation to non-humans.1 "Wiser ears are deaf 7 We have already seen that the first of these problems is foreshadowed in Deephaven when Jewett writes that country folk may "hear voices when wiser ears are deaf" (130-31). But what precisely does she mean by this, and what might such voices by trying to communicate? Some clues may be found in her most famous short story, "A White Heron." The central tension of the story occurs as Sylvia, a young girl living on a farm in the Maine forest, struggles to maintain an uneasy silence, foregoing money and an attractive hunter's gratitude by refusing to reveal a rare bird's location. With nowhere left to retreat from the plume</page><page sequence="6">56 ISLE hunters and museum collectors, in a land of second-growth where a lone giant white pine seems the only remnant of the primeval forest, her enigmatic silence becomes, paradoxically, the "linguistic" version of the heron's - and nature's - impassive resistance. Sylvia's unwillingness to betray the heron by speaking is contrasted by an animate nature's garrulousness with her. Jewett characterizes the ani- mals and plants in Sylvia's forest environment as alert and responsive to the child's presence. For example, the family cow's "pranks" are under- stood as an "intelligent attempt to play hide and seek" (286), while the old-growth pine is imbued with a vegetable sentience that responds to Sylvia as she climbs it in search of the heron: "[the tree] must truly have been amazed that morning through all its ponderous frame as it felt this determined spark of human spirit wending its way from higher branch to branch. Who knows how steadily the least twigs held themselves to advantage this light, weak creature on her way!" (292). As her grand- mother says "the wild creaturs [sic] counts her one o' themselves'" (289). Despite her obvious feeling for the natural world, there is a sense that in the bittersweet trade-off of the heron for the possibilities of pas- sion, knowledge, and urbanity represented by the hunter, Sylvia does not know exactly what moves her: . . . she must keep silence! What is it that suddenly forbids her and makes her dumb? Has she been nine years growing and now, when the great world for the first time puts out a hand to her, must she thrust it aside for a bird's sake? The murmur of the pine's green branches is in her ears, she remembers how the white heron came flying through the golden air and how they watched the sea and the morning together, and Sylvia cannot speak; she cannot tell the heron's secret and give its life away. (293-294) "Pathetic fallacy" seems the appropriate literary term to deploy here, but there is more to Jewett's descriptions than the projection of human emotion into nature. The child is involved in an exchange with her environment: it is as if the natural world is communicating some vital piece of information through her. By not speaking, in effect Sylvia is speaking for nature, denying the hunter his prize and leaving nature intact. But the question remains, what does keep her from speaking? In my view, Jewett has endowed Sylvia with the intuitive, unreason- ing listening skills that those with "wiser ears" have lost. She still takes "instinct as truth," has yet to separate intellect from emotion. By dwell- ing side-by-side with the members of her non-human community, na- ture is able to voice its concerns through her; in fact, it would seem that it is precisely because she is a simple, instinctual soul that she can hear and respond to nature's voice.</page><page sequence="7">"In Their Own Language " 57 But while Sylvia is truly a "child of nature," her attunement, like that of the "country people," to the quiet voice of nature is finally only half-heartedly endorsed by Jewett, as the ambivalence of the conclud- ing passage indicates: "Were the birds better friends than their hunter might have been - who can tell? Whatever treasures were lost to her, woodlands and summer-time, remember! Bring your gifts and graces and tell your secrets to this lonely country child!" (294). In Sylvia's case, listening and responding to nature ends on a desultory note, for while the heron is preserved, the hunter leaves, disappointed and puzzled, and it is by no means clear whether her trade-off has been anything more than a Pyrhrric victory. Speech and Silence As Lawrence Buell puts it, Sylvia is compelled to protect the heron "not because the heron is a symbolic extension of her but because she feels herself to be an extension of it" (198). In this sense, Sylvia may never have had much of a choice in her encounter with nature, for in Jewetťs vision, "country people" or little girls who hear nature's voice are inspired by an ethical imperative: nature, in effect, is trying to pro- tect itself by working through sensitive listeners. Patrick Murphy de- scribes how contemporary ecofeminists might arrive at similar, ethi- cally-charged interpretations of nature's voice: The point is not to speak for nature but to work to render the signifi- cation presented to us by nature into a verbal depiction by means of speaking subjects, whether this is through characterization in the arts or through discursive prose. The test for whether such depic- tions seem accurate renderings of the speaking subjects will be the actions in the world that they call on humans to perform. Unless we believe that the earth is attempting to commit biospheric suicide, we cannot accept arguments based on instrumental reason as a rendering of nature as a speaking subject (152-53) Jewetťs sketch, "River Driftwood," provides an example of what I think Murphy has in mind. But it also previews some of the complications of the speech/ silence dichotomy, which I claimed was a second pitfall for ecofeminist theory. Here again Jewett ponders the communicational po- tential of nature, playfully suggesting that science might discover a way to decipher the language of beasts. In the context of writing about the Piscataqua River that flows past her native Berwick, Jewett notes it is but seldom, as yet, that people really care much for anything for its own sake, until it is proved to have some connection with</page><page sequence="8">58 ISLE humankind. We are slow to take an interest in the personality of our neighbors who are not men, or dogs, or horses, or at least some creature who can be made to understand a little of our spoken language. Who is going to be the linguist who learns the first word of an old crow's warning to his mate, or how a little dog expresses himself when he asks a big one to come and rout his troublesome enemy? How much we shall know when the pimpernel teaches us how she makes her prophecies of the weather, and how long we shall have to go to school when people are expected to talk to the trees, and birds, and beasts, in their own language! (168-69) The passage marks an interesting departure from the familiar motif of an inert "Book of Nature" (referred to in the Deephaven passages) to a notion of an active, speaking subjectivity which "teaches" humans, who are now put in the position of listener rather than reader. But Jewett quickly qualifies the altruistic tenor of her vision by positing its eco- nomic advantages: We could have schools for them, and could educate them into be- ing more useful to us. There would be intelligent swordfish for submarine divers, and we could send swallows to carry messages, and all the creatures that know how to burrow in the earth would bring us the treasures out of it. (169) The commodification of her fantasy might simply indicate that she is willing to push her whimsical treatment of nature's voice only so far - or that she is shrewd enough to know the value of arguments from enlightened self-interest in capitalist America. Yet in the next passage, Jewett seems to reconsider that argument, drawing back from what she has allowed to become a rather sharply utilitarian perspective: It is not necessary to tame [animals] before they can be familiar and responsive; we can meet them on their own ground, and be surprised to find out how much we have in common. Taming is only forcing them to learn some of our customs; we should be wise if we let them tame us to make some use of theirs. They share other instincts and emotions with us beside surprise, or suspicion or fear. They are curiously thoughtful; they act no more from unconscious instinct than we do; at least, they are called upon to decide as many questions of action and direction, and there are many emergen- cies of life when we are far more helpless than they. (169) As Jewett shuttles back and forth from a position decidedly anthro- pocentric to one in which animals are, so to speak, "equal partners," we may understand and sympathize with her gropings toward some way of speaking about - and for - animals that balances her idealism</page><page sequence="9">"Jn Their Own Language" 59 with her pragmatism. But what finally emerges from her musings is predictably dualistici It is easy to say that other orders of living creatures exist on a much lower plane than ourselves; we know very little about it, after all. They are gifted in some way that we are not; they may even carry some virtue of ours to a greater height than we do. But the day will come for a more truly universal suffrage than we dream of now, when the meaning of every living thing is understood, and it is given its rights and accorded its true value: for its life is from God's life, and its limits were fixed by him; its material shape is the manifestation of a thought, and to each body there is given a spirit. (169) By invoking Utopian rhetoric and deferring the "universal suffrage" to a time beyond imagining, Jewett undercuts her own case for the real transformation of human /animal relations in the here and now. But more crucially, in triangulating her ideal ordering of life on "God," and aided by the Transcendentalist subsumption of all material nature into spirit, Jewett signals that she is simply not willing to abandon the human/ animal opposition. Such an abandonment could begin only if her notions of "true value" were relinquished altogether, and if the similarities and differences between humans and animals were taken as merely biological facts, not signposts to higher realities. Still, I do not wish to minimize Jewetťs contribution to a budding conservationist ethic, which despite its humanistic orientation was clearly beginning to rethink the enduring, one-sided relationship be- tween humans and non-humans. She struggles, as Scott Russell Sand- ers says, with those literary challenges that face all writers who view the world from an ecological perspective: "how. . . to make us feel the ache and tug of the organic web passing through us, how to situate the lives of characters - and therefore writers - in nature" (661). So to say that Jewetťs vision is ultimately anthropocentric, utilitarian, or simply naive is only to state the obvious, and does not really help us under- stand the dialectical agon playing out behind the vision. In this latter sense, what is significant about "River Driftwood" is that we see just how difficult it was for Jewett to render non-humans into speaking subjects while simultaneously maintaining her nascent ecocentric con- ceptual framework - that is, a framework which extends ethical con- sideration to nature but which also excludes the human values and imperatives that seem always to insert themselves back into that frame- work. Contemporary ecofeminists face the same paradox: how can you construct nature to "speak" for itself? Or what amounts to the same thing: how can you allow nature to speak univocally and transpar-</page><page sequence="10">60 ISLE ently through you? The answer is that you cannot - unless you are pre- pared to claim that there is something "real" beneath the speech, un- touched and untouchable by the anthropocentric bias, that your own purified and transparent speech merely announces. Jewetťs solution presupposes just that: there is a "meaning for every living thing" which will some day become clear. She affirms "God" and the prospect of His "truly universal suffrage" as the ultimate stopgap against selfish hu- man motives, so that when nature is eventually understood to speak, it will speak in tones tantamount to God's own. From an agnostic perspective, however, Jewetťs speaking subjects must therefore remain spoken subjects, for without the invocation of the "transcendental signifier" that is God, non-humans must continue to rely on us to listen to and translate their meanings. Yet even when we set aside Jewetťs assumption of eventual divine intervention, her seemingly prescient metaphoric exchange of Bacon's "Volume of Na- ture" for "talking nature" does not take us as far as one might initially imagine. To put a finer point on this, when ecofeminists similarly jetti- son the metaphor of "reading the volume of nature" in favor of "listen- ing to speaking subjects," they would appear, like Jewett, to be pro- moting a decisive shift in our conception of nature, asking us to attend more carefully to nature's "claims" rather than our own. This shift aims to relocate these speaking subjects in a place safe from ideological mis- appropriations, to reconstruct non-humans as entities who provide their own meanings and motives - which humans may detect, for example, by hearkening "to the cries of the wounded" (Roach 57). My objection here is that for both the "Volume of Nature" trope and its speaking subject successor, nature remains "underwritten" by what is finally an identical ordering of the world, in which meaning is presumed to lie encoded in nature, no matter whether it is to be read or heard. To the extent that they merely travel from a "graphocentric" to the "phonocentric" arrangement, ecofeminists retain a nature fully inscribed in a logocentric framework, a nature which can supposedly provide direct access by means of outward signs to its internal Truth. As Robert Harrison formulates the problem, "If animals could speak, they would no longer be animals but a species of humanity, which is another way of saying that language is the distinguishing trait of human beings. But this does not advance us very far, for the nature of language is as much in doubt these days as human nature" (427). The move from reading to listening is thus only a deferral of the basic issue - the non- identicality of Truth with its signs - with the net result that nature must remain the junior member in the human/non-human dichotomy, reli- ant upon its voluble other to discern through layers of inarticulateness a hard kernel of meaning.2 And, needless to say, the very idea of "deep</page><page sequence="11">" In Their Own Language " 61 meaning" and "Truth" smacks of the kind of essentialism that else- where most savvy ecofeminists seek scrupulously to avoid. The Phonocentric Fallacy As I suggested earlier, with regard to non-humans we may be wiser to avoid the phonocentric implications of "speaking subjects" by simply side-stepping that metaphor altogether. "Speaking subject," whatever its value in linguistic, psychological, and philosophic discourse, places an unnecessary burden on our construction of animals and natural entities in general. The unfortunate outcome of this approach is to reinscribe yet again a notion of their "essence," their "intention," their "meaning," what it is that they are "saying" to us, as if there is some deep secret to be communicated if we would only listen more care- fully. Yet surely non-humans are the "material-semiotic actors" Donna Haraway has written of, whose "boundaries materialize in social in- teractions" (200-01). What is called for, then, are ways to theorize the procedures and assumptions we use to locate the boundaries of our- selves, boundaries which inevitably serve to locate them in relation to us - regardless of what they "really" are and what they "really" mean. In fact, their inscrutability, their stubborn otherness, may be their great- est protection from the recklessness which so often accompanies our desire to dissect and domesticate a world we have long wished would divulge its "innermost secrets." We humans, for as long as we care to imagine, have had consequential relationships with animals. They have been our enemies, our compan- ions, our food; they have been loved and reviled, sacralized and sacri- ficed. It is at best improbable that an injunction to think of them as speak- ing through us - or despite us - can redirect the mass of embodied expe- rience. By "embodied experience" I mean only that everyday we interact with them as other living beings, whom we recognize as different in some ways, alike in many others. My brother thinks of fish as units, some- one else worries about their pain, Jewett wants to know if their virtue exceeds ours, others think of them not at all. Yet not one of these charac- terizations tells us anything about what non-humans are, for the onto- logical question is finally moot. What all these views can remind us of, however, is that in our construction of our relationships to non-hu- mans we inevitably reveal much more about ourselves than we do about them: about the blindness of our economy, the limits of our compas- sion, the heights of our arrogance, and the depths of our ignorance. Thus it must be to our own social organization - particularly its ten- dency to instrumentalize the entire world and everything in it - that we must attend. Quite simply, while some may take it as a measure of</page><page sequence="12">62 ISLE ethical maturity and biocentric magnanimity to make the attempt, it is in fact no great favor to now bid non-humans to speak, for even if we did imagine them doing so I suspect we would continue to use them in uncounted ways. The ability to speak has never been a guarantee of confraternity. Rather, it will have to be enough to acknowledge that non-humans are important figures in the human Umwelt, and to real- ize that the critical factor in determining our dealings with them has always originated not so much in how we constitute them but in how we constitute ourselves. What sort of "speaking subjects" are humans? There is ample evidence to suggest that we are speakers of male power, of scientific mastery, of thoughtless pleasure, of extravagant waste, and of brutal violence. In the end, it matters very little that nature does not speak: humans can speak, but that fact has not prevented them from being placed on the slaughter bench of history. NOTES 1. While it is common to equate the silence of nature with its lack of subjec- tivity, the two are not the same. In fact, by defining the subject as one who speaks (as opposed, for example, to one who is read) we are still playing the game of defining non-humans according to some criteria of what we take to consititute the human, to bring non-humans "up to our level/' whatever that is. There is a long tradition of this among animal rights theorists (starting with Jeremy Bentham) - of trying to demonstrate, in other words, that animals ac- tually violate and invade the space of the human by sharing whatever particu- lar quality one chooses to define as uniquely human (the ability to feel pain, to suffer, and so on). But linking subjectivity with "speaking" actually seems a fairly retrograde notion, in that there are surely other ways to rethink the bounds of subjectivity that are far less bumdesome in terms of the historical and cul- tural freight that comes along with them. The question is simply this: why do we suppose that we must ask of nature that it produce a noise, a sign, so that we can demonstrate it has agency and interests? For that matter, why do we want to play this game of one-up(hu)manship at all? 2. In a recent article in ISLE , Barton Levi St. Armand also wonders whether the denunciation of the "Volume of Nature" tradition is particularly effica- cious because, as he suggests, the idea of nature as a book was "originally a means of liberating [nature] rather than enslaving it into what today might be called a 'subaltern subject position"' (31). The notion, then, that the Book of Nature is an egregious, logocentric construction begs the question as to what replacement would not also be logocentric - given that the "presence" of logocentrism does not hinge on the form of the sign but the fact of signs them- selves. In other words, whether by "reading" or "listening" we never avoid interpolating nature, so that the crucial issue for both the volume of nature and the voice of nature figure is whether in such figures the unavoidable medi- ating role of readers or listeners is foregrounded and problematized. Along such lines, as St. Armand suggests, even "the idea of nature as a smaller, more beauti-</page><page sequence="13">"Jn Their Own Language" 63 fui, more user-friendly paperback may yet play its part in the postmodernist search for the sublime" (42).
