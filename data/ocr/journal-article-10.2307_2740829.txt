They document a complex use of manufactured art and symbol among region- ally scattered and culturally and genetically diverse groups of modern Homo sapiens from the period of the typical Aurignacian, ca. 32,000 B.C., to the termi- nal Magdalenian, ca. 10,000 B.C. These engraved materials appear in all the cultures of the Upper Paleolithic of Europe, though they are not present at every site. The decorated caves and rock walls of the period are regional and specialized aspects of the more general, widespread tradition of symbol usage represented by the mobiliary materials. This paper is concerned with particular cognitive aspects of the symbol-making tradition as found on the mobiliary materials. The data have been obtained by a new methodology, involving a microscopic reex- amination of a large proportion of the engraved Upper Paleolithic artifacts in 65 European collections in nine countries. For the purposes of cross-cultural comparison, the research was conducted with the materials from different regions and periods: the full range of the Upper Paleolithic in the Franco- Cantabrian region; the East Gravettian (Pavlovian) of eastern Europe; the Solutrean and Magdalenian of eastern Spain; the Italian Perigordian, Epi- Gravettian, and Romanellian; and the late German Hamburgian and Ahrensburgian. Again, for pur- poses of comparison and in order to test the method- ology with materials from a later period, a large portion of the engraved Mesolithic materials of Eu- rope was subjected to microscopic analysis. One result of these latter analyses has been to document the continuation and development of the basic Upper Paleolithic trandition of symbol usage past the termi- nal Magdalenian (Marshack 1970b, 1972a). Before presenting a sampling of the results of these studies, I note that there is evidence from scattered Mousterian sites for a use of symbol (Blanc 1961, Binford 1968) usually involving a symbolic use of natural objects or areas: antlers, skulls, horns, un- worked bone and stone, red ochre, human bodies, caves. The rare verified examples of manufactured Mousterian symbolism are significant but will be examined in a separate study. Leroi-Gourhan has excavated an intentionally engraved bone artifact from a Chattelperronian level at the site of Arcy-sur- Cure, ca. 33,000 B.C. (Leroi-Gourhan and Leroi- Gourhan 1964: Fig. 8, n. 2). But it is with the typical Aurignacian that the archaeological levels begin to supply us with a wide range and abundance of evolved symbol.

Detail, engraved portion of Blanchard plaque, main face. variously called polishers, spatulas, palettes, or knives. The pla(lue is carved from antler; the main face is concave and scraped smooth, the reverse face relatively rough and convex, having been only par- tially worked. The reverse face is engraved with what seem to be additional random marks. Edge notches on bone objects of this type have been called gripping marks, presuming a utilitarian purpose for the artifact and the marks. Intentionally engraved face marks have been termed decorative or of unknown intent. When face markings are ap- parently more structured than they are on this Blanchard example, they have been called geometric motifs or marques de chasse, the latter suggesting a tally of animals killed (Jones 1875). Mor-e recently such mai-ks have been thought to indicate an arithmetic system of counting (Absolon 1957). Exhaustive microscopic analysis of the Blanchard pla(ue reveals a complex series of facts. The pock- marking on the main face was made in a tiny area 4.5 cm in length (Fig. 2). Within this area, groups or sets of marks, varying in count from one to eight, were made by different engraving points, that is, by cutting edges that left a different cross-section print in the bone. Each set was also made by a different style of 9 *M E:t ~~~~~~~~~~~~t FIG. 3.

Some strokes arc from right to left ( Q ), others from left to right (Q ), some form a paitial half arc (ts), some wNere simply punched into the bone or were made by a turn on the impact axis ( * ). Each set of marks wvas accumulated as a horizontal series. Adjoin- ing sets were appended linearly and horizontally, either at the right or left. There is a single exception: at top left there are four marks, each made by the same cutting point and each arcing from right to left (Fig. 3). Together these four marks form a rough s(luare. The two upper and two lower marks to the right of this s(luare were made by different engraving points and styles of stroke. It is therefore clear that the four marks that structttre the s(luare form a point-of-turning in the linear accumulation: C;&gt; C; It is not immediatelyr apparent in which direction the accumulation proceeds, but with clarification of a turn at the s(luare the full structur-e of the engraved image becomes evident. The engraver had intention- ally formed a serpentine image (Fig. 4). In composing the image, the maker had changed his point or- style of stroke 24 times in a sequence of 69 unit marks. Once the image has been clarified it is apparent that the se(luence begins on the inside of the figuL-e and ends on the inside at a different point. The image makes five "turns" wsithin a small area. A fuller- photomicrographic docttmentation of this plaqlue is in press (Marshack 1971 b, 1 972 a). 446 C U R R E N T A NT H R O P 0 L 0 (. Y</page><page sequence="3">It is obvious that the engraved image is neither random nor accidental. Though recognizably serpen- tine, it is neither art nor decoration. The fact is that superb realistic art was being produced in this period (Riek 1932-33, Marshack 1972a). It would seem, instead, that these markings are a form of cumulative notation. Early theories that interpreted engraved series of marks on bone and stone as hunting tallies would explain neither the differentiated styles of strokes in the accumulation nor the final serpentine image. It is doubtful that a hunter would structure a tally of killed animals in this complex manner. Assuming the engraving to be notation, we can deduce many levels of cognitive complexity from this example. Since the evidence is new, the deductions that follow introduce new parameters into the inter- pretation of Upper Paleolithic symbolism. First, the image was not conceived and executed at a single moment. Instead, it was accumulated over a period of time. The length of time is difficult to determine. But since there are 24 changes of point, or style of stroke and pressure, the period was divided into at least 24 recognizable, separated moments. Microscopic analysis of comparable Aurignacian no- tations, including a determination of the differential wear and erosion, overengraving, and changes of point in diverse sets, has shown that such composi- tions were sometimes accumulated over periods ex- tending into months (Marshack 1971 b, 1972a). I have termed such compositions "time-factored," referring not only to the sequence of engraving but to the probable cultural meanings in these symbolic ac- cumulations. Since we are dealing with an accumulation of sets, whose counts in this case vary from one to eight, we can assume that cognitive evaluations and differentia- tions were being made by the man who was engraving the sequence. He probably could, to a degree, recog- nize the sets as different in quantity but similar in content; that is, he could tell that each set was a comparable unit in the sequence no matter what the quantity of marks it contained, comparable in the sense that each set was a unit of a certain order within a well-known frame of reference and system of usage. In addition, each single mark in a set was a unit in a recognizable suborder. At the completion of the full sequence there was available a superordinate "sum." Though cognitively quantitative, this sum need not have been arithmetic. It might have been in large part mythic, that is, a sum that was a sequence of storied parts. An example would be any form of mnemonic notation. At the end of the accumulation there were also five points-of-turning and a final image that was serpentine. These provided additional visual- kinesthetic and spatial elements or cues that were involved in giving meaning to the sum of the com- position. Without any assumptions as to the possible seman- tic or cultural meanings in this sequence, it would seem that the man making this notation was working in a sophisticated and evolved tradition at the ex- traordinarily early date of c a. 32,000 B.C. Familiarity with a tradition is also implied in the small scale of the engraved marks, in the small size of the final image, Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING FIG. 4.

The scale of the engraving is comparable to that of a modern tallying device such as the meter or inch rule and the watch, in which abstracted unit marks and sets of marks are differentiated and recognized only because one knows the system and the frame of reference. Five unit marks on a meter rule and five marks on a watch are, as marks in linear sequence, stylistically indistinguishable. They function cogni- tively only within their known traditional structures. In this matter of the use of a minute sequential notation we can say that this Aurignacian engraver was a modern Homo sapiens functioning in a complex culture with fully evolved brain structures and cogni- tive processes.2 The evidence for the presence of an ancient tradi- tion is strengthened by the markings on the reverse face of ,the plaque. The face is naturally rough because it is the inside surface of the excised section of bone or antler. On this secondary surface there is a subsidiary engraving, revealed by microscopic ex- amination to consist of six sets of marks composed linearly (Fig. 5). Because of the rough surface it is difficult to assay the cross-sections and stroke differ- ences of the marks in order to determine any possible subsets within the large groups. However, one stroke, apparently the first on this face, is clearly arced. Comparing this composition with that on the other face, we note that the accumulation of sets is not 2 The extreme miniaturization of certain classes of Upper Paleolithic symbol is documented also in other papers in press (Marshack 1970b,c,d, 1971a,b, 1972a).

Instead, at bottom right, there are four sets that appear to be engraved as parallel sequences. Since we do not know the direction of engraving or of "read- ing," it is possible that these were all engraved from top to bottom, with the remaining two groups in mid-plaque having been engraved from right to left. But the notation might also have been made in a number of other ways. An alternative sequence of engraving could make the reading almost "serpen- tine": 11 4 4 Despite these analytic uncertainties, it is clear that the sets are not accidental, random, decorative, or images of "art." Since they were probably made by the same hand as the notation on the other face and certainly by the same culture, we can assume that the basic tradition consisted, not of serpentine accumula- tions, but more generally of sets accumulated linearly. These were differentiated visually, kinesthetically (by the muscular inputs and recognitions involved in the engraving and turning of the bone and by the differ- ent directions of making and reading of each se- quence), spatially, temporally (by the moments of their making), and by the rhythm, placement, and size of the marks and sets. The serpentine image on the first face seems, then, to be a particularized instance of the general tradi- tion. Whatever the semantic content of the notation, we can probably assume that the making and the reading were aided by inputs and recalls at many levels in a sequence that extended over a considerable period. The complexity of the notational process included factors in the genetic, the individual, and the cultural realms. It included the cognitive capacity of the species, a general capacity that could operate with a certain degree of variability within an estab- lished tradition. It included those broad notational patterns and structures maintained by the culture and therefore known to the engraver. Finally, it included the visual-kinesthetic and spatial-temporal inputs that were involved in the engraving of these particular compositions. These would seem to be the basic requirements of any notation, and they were fully present in the Aurignacian. Though we seem to have here a form of quantifica- tion approaching counting, there is nothing in the sequence of sets to indicate the periodicities of a highly developed system of arithmetic numbering, such as a counting by fives or tens. Still, at the level of cognition that is implied, the man engraving the plaque could probably differentiate the sets and se- quences of the first face from those of the second face, recognize which face was made first, and in- tegrate the two either as a sum or as aspects of a single tradition. This may not seem an important insight, but it will be seen to be crucial in terms of the continuing analysis of Upper Paleolithic notational materials. If these inferences are valid, we can make others. It is possible that the man beginning the serpentine notation had a foreknowledge of the major "turn- ings" that were to come as well as a general knowl- edge of the number of marks to each: (2)-15-15-14- 16-(7). Knowledge of this sort must have been involved in the reason for beginning the notation. In this notation the "2" seems introductory and the "7" posterior and subsidiary to the major groupings. It is therefore quite likely that it was not the individual mark, or even the small subset, but the larger groups differentiated by the turnings and by the completed composition that were the significant and cohering cultural elements. Within this traditional understand- ing, the subsets may have had their own meaning. AURIGNACIAN: ABRI LARTET From a typical Aurignacian level in the Dordogne, at the site of Lartet in the Gorge d'Enfer, comes a plaque of roughly the same size (10 cm) and ovaloid shape as that from Blanchard, also engraved on both faces and along the edges (Fig. 6a,b) (Lartet and Christy 1875: 98-99, B P1. xiii). The markings on the plaque are in a style that has been traditionally termed "geometric." Microscopic examination reveals that the markings form a cumulative notation in the tradition of the plaque from Blanchard, despite the fact that the final composition is visually different. On the first, some- what convex, face there are five sets of linear marks, varying in count from five to eight and totalling 31. Each set is made by a different point, at a different angle, to a different length, and with varying rhythm, pressure, and spacing. Between these sets are blank areas that serve as elements of differentiation (Fig. 7). The sets are accumulated horizontally along the edge of the plaque, as though it served as a visual- kinesthetic linear guide. These linear sets are made with a generous use of space upon one-half the face. In addition, there are other sets of smaller marks made as dots arranged in vertical series, each dot made by a twisting, turning stroke. The reverse face, equally smoothed and scraped but somewhat concave, contains a similar differentia- tion and accumulation. There are six sets of linear marks, varying in count from three to eight and totalling 35. Each set is made, like those on the previous face, with different points, pressures, angles, and rhythms, and with a comparable expansive use of space. In the areas remaining on this face, at the left, there are sets of dots engraved in vertical series. Another group of dots is placed in the center of the face, between the upper and lower linear sets. Microscopic analysis of the serpentine image on the Blanchard plaque made it possible to reconstruct the full linear sequence of accumulation. On this example the microscope cannot determine such a continuous 448 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="5">&lt;Q ; &lt;:\&lt;- %' o . ? 1. 0 *0 a *0 0 0 fi/ * .o* 0 0 0 0 o .0. *) FIG. 6.

The inicro- scope reveals that these Nwere made by two points and were divided into subsets of six and three. These nine came before or after the other- dots on this face, and apparently after the linear sets that were the first marks on each face. Because the pla(lue had been soaked in a pteserva- tive gelatin, it was not possible to do an ade(quate cross-section analysis of each dot. Nevertheless, as far as can be determined, the dot sets were made by differe-nt points, pressures, and rhythms. Clearly the markings on this pla(lue are not ran- dom, accidental, decorative, or artistic. Instead they ar-e intentional, cumulative, se(quential, and therefore notational, with a complex system of visual-kines- thetic and spatial differentiations for the sets, subsets, and lar-ger superordinate groupings. The breakdown upon each face into a group of dots and a group of linear marks presents Uts with four differentiated sums. These combine to give a higher total for the full pla(lue. These large sums are divided into at least 32 subsets, none of which exceeds the count of ten. Though the style of marking is different, this plaqLue provides us wvith a notational se(luence as complex as that on the Blanchard pla(que and with the same essential visual and kinesthetic cognitive refer- ences. It is significant that during seven years of research no notational compositions either on the two faces of a single artifact or betwveen artifacts were found to contain the same breakdown of groups in se(luence or to structure similar images. Even when two notational artifacts were engraved in the same style and came from the same site and level, the specific intentional differences between them turned out to be as im- portant in establishing the fact of notation as the similarities due to the common cultural tradition (Marshack 1971 b: Figs. 44, 59). These data ar-e part of the evidence that what we have is not design patterns or geometric lmotifs but a relatively open, variable system of notation. This open, variable aspect of the system is found upon every notational slate I have exan-mined, fromn the Aurignacian- to the termininal Magdlaleniani andcl into the Mesolithic (Marshack 1970 a-d, 1971a, b, 1972a). AURIGNACIAN: A 212 An apparently unpublished pla(lue from an un- determined Ati-ignacian site in the Dordogne, label- led "A 212" in the collection of the Musce Nationale de Prehistoire in Les Eyzies, showvs engraving that is typically Aurignacian. It is 6.5 cm long and is en- graved along the edges and on both faces (Fig. 8 a, b). (The photographs appear in Marshack 1971 b: 42, Fig. 26.) The face marks are grouped into sets made at different angles and in different sizes and rhythms. The general appearance of the engraving is similar to that of the linear markingzs on the Lartet pla'ujue. Vol. 13. No. 3-4 . June-October 1972 449</page><page sequence="6">FIG. 8. Schematic rendition of all the engraved marks on the two faces (a, b) of plaqjue A 212 as determined by microscopic analysis, indicating the sets, their size, angle, rhythm of spacing, overengraving, and placement in rela- tion to the edges. The microscope reveals significant differences be- tween this plaque and the two described above. On the second face there is a long, deeply engraved and overengraved cutting line along the right side. It had apparently been made in order to break the plaque. The rough break in the bone along this line occurs on the other face. Along the left edge of the second face there is the irregular outline of an accidental break- age of the bone. Microscopic examination of the edge marks and face marks reveals that they were en- graved after both the natural breakage and the intentional cutting and breakage. On the second face the linear marks at the lower left are placed so as to allow for the irregularity of the break. The linear marks at lower right on the first face do the same. Of greater interest, the edge marks are engraved upon and around the broken edge, as is apparent at the lower right on the first face. What we seem to have, then, is an originally whole, shaped plaque that was accidentally broken and was then further broken to make a slate that was subsequently engraved on both faces and on the edges. The evidence gives us one more indication that such engraving was intentional and nondecorative. Here a broken artifact was altered to make a surface that would take an engraved notation in the style of that region and period. The original, shaped plaque may have been a practical working tool; the altered plaque was not. We can therefore infer that the edge marks in this case were not intended to serve as gripping marks for a tool. An analysis of the edge marks reveals that, like the face marks, they were made by different engrav- a b FIG. 9. Schematic rendition of the edge marks (a, b) on plaque A 212, as determined by microscopic analysis, indicating breakdown into sets. ing points as well as at different angles, and with differing pressures and rhythms of spacing (Fig. 9 a, b). The breakdown of these sets is so clearly intention- al as to suggest that edges may have served as one more area of visual-kinesthetic and spatial differen- tiation in the accumulation of a notational sequence. The microscope reveals other cognitive, differen- tiating aspects of the notational tradition. On the second face the linear marks are rather short, leaving a large space between the upper and lower sets. This area is filled with a subsidiary set. On the first face, however, the linear marks are longer, leaving little room for a secondary marking between the sets. Instead we find, at bottom right, that eight strokes (six and two) are crossed over by nine strokes (seven and two) made at a different angle. Near them, to the left, three strokes are crossed over by four at an angle. On the second face, along the upper edge, there are three widely spaced marks that are crossed over at an angle by ten lightly engraved strokes. Such markings have sometimes been called chevrons, hatchings, or geometric patterns. The microscope reveals that they are composed of linear sets that are crossed over by other linear sets, often made with different points and to a different count. Presumably the sets were made at different times and therefore do not structure a chevron or hatch motif. The placement and irregularity of these crossing sets suggest once more that they are not random, decora- tive, or artistic. I present below other evolved exam- ples in this style. Analysis of A 212 raises a question about the Blanchard and Lartet plaques. This is a fragment, but the other two are more or less complete artifacts; the minimum breakage they contain occurs along their edges and is due to their burial and excavation. Can an analysis of their edges tell us something about the original use of the plaques or about the edge-marking tradition hinted at on A 212? Microscopic analysis of the edges of the Blanchard and Lartet plaques reveals that they show substantial hand-wear and polishing. This evidence of long-term friction wear occurs pri- marily along the edges of the wider, rear half. There is no polish or friction wear along the edges of the narrower, forward half of the plaque; in fact, the original scraping marks that shaped the plaque are still almost as new here. In addition, the edge marks on these pla(ues show evidence of having been accumulated in sets (Marshack 1971 b). The rounded point at the front of each plaque shows evidence of pressure breakage due to persistent, continuous use. These plaques were therefore not knives, spatulas, 450 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="7">palettes, or polishers, but they may have been pres- sure-flakers or retouchers for chipped-stone tools. It therefore seems that tools that had a long-term use could be marked with notations that were accumulat- ed over a long period, as though availability of the engraving surface, particularly in a hunting culture, where portability was important, could make of such an object a slate. Broken tools could also provide engraving surfaces for notational marking. Micro- scopic analysis has also provided evidence of nota- tional sequences upon unworked, scrap pieces of bone, stone, antler, and ivory. The documentation for these diverse forms of notational marking is large, and examples will appear in this paper and others in press or in preparation. These three Aurignacian examples are indicative of a complex tradition. As the Upper Paleolithic proceeded, the tradition evolved, and chronological and regional styles can be distinguished. The data derived from the microscopic methodology allow us to follow these developments. PERIGORDIAN: ISTURITZ From a late Perigordian level at the site of Isturitz in the French Basses-Pyrenees comes a "bdton de com- mandement" made of reindeer antler, with the hole broken off; it has been engraved as though it had two faces, the plane of the hole helping to establish the referential geometry. The first face is engraved with eight large sets made in vertical linear seqluences but accumulated horizon- tally (Fig. 10 a). Each set is divided into subsets. The sequence of engraving is from right to left, from the thick end near the hole towards the point. The last set, at far left, proceeds fully round the baton because of the lack of space at the narrow end, recalling the comparable bunching towards the left on the flat plaque from Lartet. The second face (Fig. 10 b) is structured different- ly. The accumulation of sets seems to have been interrupted in mid-baton for a different order or style of symbolic marking. Two deeply engraved curved lines look like the schematic horn and ear of an ibex, an interpretation suggested by the schematized ibex heads found on later Franco-Cantabrian artifacts (cf. Fig. 16). There is also a schematic or "geometric" form, a kind of Y with two extra marks. To the right, to the left, below, and among these forms are sets and sequences of marks engraved both vertically and horizontally. These are made by different points, and in different sizes, rhythms, and pressures. The total effect is that of sets of notation accumulated sequen- tially but with the addition of two or three related symbols of a different order. Though the second face is visually different from the first face, it is cognitively and conceptually part of the notational tradition we have been following. The primary difference is in the presence of the subsidiary images or forms. Obvious- ly these two diversely structured faces are not ran- dom. They could probably be read as they were engraved, as a sequence of parts and as a sum. Whatever practical or ritual purpose the baton may once have had, the notations engraved on it were part Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING a / 18 13 21 14 25 11 18 29 2 1 2 9 2 7 3 5 6 b FIG. 10.

In this regard, the baton is another example of the use of a long-term "utilitarian" object as the surface for a symbolic marking. EASTERN SPANISH SOLUTREAN: PARPALLO Hundreds of nonutilitarian limestone slates en- graved either with the images of animals or with nondecorative patterns in a so-called geometric style have been found in the Valencia district of eastern Spain. The stones range from coin size to heavy slabs and extend in time from the Aurignacian to the Solutrean and through the late Magdalenian into the Mesolithic. Artifacts engraved in this geometric style have also been found in the early Neolithic. Though the style of marking in this region extends over more than 20,000 years, no two engraved patterns have been found to be alike. At the site of Parpall6 (Pericot-Garcia 1942) these engraved patterns are often found on soft, rough, irregularly shaped pieces of shale limestone that powders and crumbles to the touch. The materials and the engraved patterns present a totally different impression than is obtained from the engraved linear sequences found in the Franco-Cantabrian cultures to the north. Microscopic analysis reveals that despite these ap- parent differences in the style of engraving the stones contain the same cognitive elements as the more northern notations. In large part the visual differ- ences are due to the different materials and to the practical solutions evolved to work them. The large, free-roaming herds of reindeer, horse, bison, and mammoth in the north were not found in the warm lowlands between the mountains and the Mediter- ranean. Antler and bone did not accumulate in Vol. 13. No. 3-4-- June-October 1972 451</page><page sequence="8">comparable heaps of scrap. The populations were perhaps as much fishers of the sea and gatherers in the tide waters as regular hunters. Nevertheless, substantial amounts of engraving materials were available in the soft shale limestone of the area. Now, bone and antler will take finely engraved marks, and it is easy to compose small linear sets on them. Soft stone, however, crumbles and dis- integrates under impact or pressure, and therefore strokes tend to be wider, longer, and farther apart. It is also awkward to handle irregularly shaped soft or heavy stones. On the large slates, with many edges, the tendency would be to accumulate the sets around the stone, as it was turned while held in the lap. Engraved strokes on the flat stones would tend either to begin in mid-stone and run to the straight edge or to begin along the edge and run to the interior. The edge of such an irregularly shaped stone would serve as the orienting rule, much as did the straight edge of -a plaque. As we have seen, sequences on bone tend to accumulate linearly along the lengthwise axis of the bone; on stone, however, they tend to accumulate circularly, as the stone is turned. Once we understand this kinesthetic system, we find that the cognitive content of the accumulation is the same. The Parpallo stones reveal that sets of marks, each differentiated by angle, size of the marks, rhythm of spacing, and sometimes the engraving point, were accumulated in sequences much as they were on the bones. At its simplest, a circular accumulation of five or six sets would form the image of an irregular star, composed of sets running from near center outward to the many edges, or from these edges inward (Marshack 1972 a). Since the flat Parpallo stones are irregular in both shape and size and since they are without a referential geometric axis, it would be difficult in the accumulation of many sets over long periods to remember which was the beginning or ending set or how the stone was last held. In this sense, the axis linearity of the engraved bones was an aid to cogni- tion and to seqluential accumulation. The problem was solved on the stones by a number of cognitive schemes or strategies. An example from the Solutrean of Parpall6 indi- cates the nature of the problem and some of the solutions. This is a relatively early example in a notational tradition that maintained itself in the Va- lencia area for thousands of years, and it is somewhat less stylized than the later notations that evolved from it. An irregular, five-sided flat stone, slightly concave on one side and convex on the other, and just large enough to be held in the palm of one hand, is engraved on both faces with what seems like an impossible melange of criss-crossing lines (Pericot- Garcia 1942: 172, Fig. 201). The stone is nonu- tilitarian and is clearly not a pendant, a gaming piece, decoration, or art (Fig. 11 a, b). The microscope reveals that the lines on the first face were cut into this piece of hard, fine-grained limestone with the point of a sharp, chipped-flint tool. The lines on the second face were made by a rounded, unworked pebble that marked the surface of the stone like a piece of chalk without cutting through (Marshack 1972a: 103, Fig. 33 a, b). The totality of engraving on the first face b FIG. 11. Schematic rendition of all the engraved marks on the two faces (a, b) of limestone slate from Parpall6 as determined by microscopic analysis, indicating the sets and subsets as differentiated by angle, placement, length, and rhythm of spacing. therefore represents the work of a different period than that on the second face and may be the work of a different hand. The rough, irregular Parpallo stones were not easily portable, as were many of the lighter, smaller Franco-Cantabrian bones. They seem to have remained in the habitation area, and perhaps lay side by side with a marking tool, to be picked up when needed. While the pattern on each face is different, analysis reveals that the tradition of sequential ac- cumulation is the same; and clearly the engravings on both faces were culturally contemporaneous. I begin with an analysis of the lightly engraved concave face (Fig. 11 b), since the cognitive solution on this face is the one that continued and evolved in the Valencia area into the Magdalenian and Mesolithic. The first mark on the surface was a long line from the apex angle to the lower, longest horizontal edge. This line, the longest on the face, is the first mark in a set of three, each shorter than the last. This set divides the surface in half and is crossed over by marks that intrude from other, later sets on each side. In the area to the right there are seven sets, made sequentially. The first, at the top near the long stroke, is small and contains two partially arced lines. The next set consists of six parallel lines made at right angles to both the arced two and the long beginning line, indicating that the stone had been turned 900. These six are crossed over by eight lines made at right angles, indicating another turning of the stone. To- gether these form a "hatched" set of 14 marks at top right. Below and somewhat to the right, angled along the direction of the edge, there is a set of four long lines. These are crossed over at right angles by 17 452 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="9">smaller marks, subdivided into eight and nine. To the left of this hatched set, and between it and the original set of three marks, there is a set of three vertical lines, two long and one short. This is crossed over at right angles by 16 marks, subdivided into eight and eight. The sequence of accumulation indicated to the engraver that a set of linear marks that had not yet been crossed over was the last made and an "open" set. It was the next to be used, after a turning of the stone. When the hatch was completed, the adjacent area was available for use. This system of sequential accumulation by overen- graving and moving into adjacent areas was simple for the maker and could also be read sequentially. The entire deeply engraved reverse face (Fig. lla) was accumulated in this style. On this convex face there is no dividing line. Instead, there are three areas of grouping, each engraved in sequence and smaller than the last. Each group of sets is differen- tiated by size, placement, and the angles of accumula- tion. The beginning set upon this face contains three long lines made at an angle from the apex to the left corner, with one shorter line appended. Upon this set were engraved at right angles six other sets varying in count from six to eighteen, each set made at a somewhat different angle and with different rhythms, pressures, and lengths. These seven sets represent the first use of this surface. The next series of sets was made to the right and somewhat below. These sets use less space and are tighter in construction. In this area there are four hatched sets, each consisting of a group of long lines crossed over at right angles by a more numerous set of smaller marks. These smaller marks do not intrude into adjacent sets. The final grouping was made in the area remaining at bottom center. These sets seem terminal and subsidiary, somewhat squeezed in, and they even contain extra lines that form a tripling of the hatch as well as three leftover marks that stand alone at a side. The method of accumulation is precisely the same as on the right half of the first face. The terminal subsets remind one of those seen on prior examples. Returning to the lightly marked concave face, we note that to the left of the central dividing line the sets are accumulated more loosely, as though these repre- sented the final marking on this face. These sets are engraved irregularly one upon the other, in roughly separated or differentiated areas. The microscope shows that there are six sets on this half, ranging in count from four to nine, each made at a different angle as the stone was turned. Visually and struc- turally, though not cognitively, the system seems to fall apart here, as though the engraver realized that the sequence of accumulation did not have to con- tinue beyond the last sets in this area. We noted this structural "breakdown" among the last sets of the other face and in prior examples. The visual-kinesthetic-spatial and the sequential- temporal elements in these Parpallo compositions are of the same order and no less complex than on the Aurignacian plaques or the Perigordian baton. In the Magdalenian and Mesolithic periods of the Valencia area, this techniqlue of engraving around a stone Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING becomes highly stylized, and the visual result is rather ordered and regular, giving a more starkly "ge- ometric" appearance. Usually these compositions begin with two to four long lines dividing the stone, and the subsequent sets are then accumulated at right angles to each other, first on one half, then on the other (Marshack 1970b, 1972a). EAST GRAVETTIAN (PAVLOVIAN):MORAVIA A bulky, nonutilitarian, nondecorative chunk of mammoth tusk, ca. 27,000 B.C., from the Pavlovian is found in the Moravske Museum at Brno. It is marked with what has traditionally been called a "chevron" pattern. Microscopic analysis reveals that the so-called chevron patterning is an illusion due to the method of accumulating sets of linear marks at angles to each other (Fig. 12). The schematic line drawing indicates that the horizontally accumulated sets were divided into subsets. It is possible that each succeeding series made at an angle may have involved a 1800 turning of the tusk. Despite deterioration of the surface, it is clear under the microscope that the sets were made by different points and at different times and with differing rhythms, pressures, and lengths of stroke. It is obvious that the style of accumulating gives the whole a "chevron" appearance, much as the Parpallo style gives a "hatch" appearance. This style of ac- cumulating sets of linear marks at an angle as the bone was turned was also used for decorative pur- poses in these Pavlovian cultures, but upon different classes of artifacts. One decorated artifact has hun- dreds of such marks, forming a true overall chevron pattern, but the microscope reveals that all the marks were made by one point and in a single regular rhythm and spacing. This regional style of engraving, then, poses an analytic problem for the differentia- tion of notations from decorations. Presumably a style of notation, like a style of art, can lead to motifs of decoration. The problem is subsidiary to our present study and will be discussed in a later paper. ITALIAN UPPER PERIGORDIAN: BARMA GRANDE In the Italian Upper Paleolithic of the late Perigor- dian and Epi-Gravettian periods, a series of evolved regional notational styles appears.

There are exceptions, and the engraved stones from Romanelli and Cavallo were often of an exceedingly soft lime- stone, softer even than that of Parpallo. Instead of accumulating sets circularly around a flat stone, the evolved Italian tradition often used engraved non-notational horizontal or vertical lines to divide a surface into areas that contain sets and subsets. These lines are not "counted" and are used much as were the edges of the Aurignacian plaques, as visual-kinesthetic and spatial guides for the se- quential accumulation and the subsequent reading. Within these engraved guidelines, the accumulation of sets is in the styles we have seen above. A well-known pebble excavated in the 19th century at the site of Barma Grande in north Italy, near Menton, France, has supposedly "geometric" patterns engraved on each face (Graziosi 1956: P1. 106b). The microscope reveals that the pebble may have been used, like some of the Aurignacian plaques, as a fine retouch pressure-flaker. I present a schematic drawing based on microscopic analysis (Fig. 13a, b). Having clarified certain cognitive aspects of earlier nota- tions, and having recognized the non-notational char- acter of the containing lines, it is possible to deter- mine the manner in which the sets and subsets are accumulated and differentiated. The deeply en- graved containing lines were themselves made se- quentially. Within and between them, the sets and subsets are made in different "styles," sometimes parallel, sometimes crossed over to form a hatch, sometimes as a series of running angles (a style that appears also in the Franco-Cantabrian area), some- times forming a chevron pattern. Significantly, the FIG. 14. Line rendition of engraved mammoth tusk from Gontzi as it would appear if unrolled (after Scerbakiskyj 1926-27). straight edges of the stone are also used, much as the containing lines are, to separate and differentiate sets. The style is highly evolved and sophisticated, but if one proceeds sequentially, set by set, one finds that the basic concepts are the same as in the prior examples. There is, however, something new: the occasional placement at certain points in some sets of a differentiating mark or group of marks, as though these were intended to indicate something special at these points. (A fuller analysis of this example ap- pears in Marshack 1971b, 1972a.) UKRAINIAN UPPER PALEOLITHIC: GONTZI Another example comes from a late, evolved phase of the Ukrainian Upper Paleolithic. From Gontzi, on the Udai River, comes a rounded tip of mammoth ivory (Scerbakiwskyj 1926-27:115, Figs, VIII, IX) with an exceedingly fine, complex engraving consisting of a long line running from the edge of the thick end towards the point on one face, then around the point and back on the other face to the thick end again (Fig. 14). The two faces are determined by the geometry of the long line.3 Along this engraved line there are four large groups or periods of unit notation, two along the top on the first face and two along the bottom. Most of the marks of the lower set at bottom left are lost in a break of the ivory, but the remnant lines are still visible. These four notational groups are visually and kinesthetically differentiated by the spaces be- tween them and by their placement on different faces. The long containing line serves both referential and integrating purposes on this rounded tusk, com- parable to the straight edges of the Aurignacian plaques. The basic notational sequences are made along and below this line. Since they are on the inside of the final image, this may be an indication that the tusk was turned 180? to engrave each face. This engraved line is non-notational and nonsymbolic. Its purpose is to delineate and order the accumulating sequences and sets of unit marks. In this sense, it is stylistically different from, but cognitively related to, 3 The Gontzi ivory is the only example in the present paper that was not examined by microscope. Other examples from the Soviet Union that may be notational and are seemingly engraved in styles found in Western Europe have been illustrated by Gvozdover (1953: Figs. 14, 24-26), Abramova (1967), and Polikarpovich (1968:27, 40,44,47). 454 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="11">the engraved non-notational containing lines on the Barma Grande pebble. The line also serves a more sophisticated purpose. Since it structures the se- quence linearly, it has a cognitive function com- parable to the serpentine form on the Blanchard plaque, though the Blanchard image was conceptual and implied rather than delineated. A notational line, real or conceptual, is in its own way an abstraction and a symbol, but of a different order than the sets. It is a model that aids the engraver in the preparation, the accumulation, and the cognitive summing that can occur at any point. The Gontzi notation is more complex than any we have studied. The four large groups or sets are divided into subsets in a manner which indicates a multiple, contrapuntal system or series of cross- references and subdivisions. Long unit lines are inter- spersed with more numerous short lines. Together these structure the basic subsets. But these subsets then contain additional differentiations at certain points in the sequence. In the group at top right, where the notation apparently begins, there are marks that form angles: These occur among the unit marks engraved below the long containing line. They constitute a differen- tiation within the body of unit marks and may them- selves be units in the basic notation. They recall the occasional marks of this type on the Barma Grande pebble. Above the long containing line, in the spaces be- tween the major periods or sets, there are linear marks that seem to have an interrelational or a summing reference. It is as if they indicated some- thing about the periods just ended, this moment between, or the next group to begin. Since these marks have their own area of placement-above the long line-we may assume that they are units of a different order. Within each of the four large notational groups there are occasional marks that are placed above, or cross above, the containing line, as though to indicate still another order of differentiation at these points. Midway between the upper and lower notations engraved along the long, curved line there is a linear structure or form consisting of two long horizontal lines crossed over by four shorter lines, as though it were a summing or commenting device of still anoth- er order, this time related to the full composition and not to some aspect of relation between two adjoining sets. Clearly the total composition is not accidental, random, decorative, or artistic. In fact, Soviet archae- ologists have referred to it as an example that seems to have meaning. If the composition is approached as a highly evolved, regional example of sequential notation, we can begin its analysis, as I have done, and attempt to understand it in general cognitive terms without knowing its precise meaning. The complexi- ties, instead of hindering an understanding, become indicative and useful. The Perigordian example from Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING Isturitz, for example, contains two non-notational images or symbolic forms on its second face, one like the horn and ear of an ibex, the other like a schematic branch. It may be that the branched form is com- parable to the middle structure on the Gontzi ivory, a form of symbolic notation. The pebble from Barma Grande contains among its sets many marks indicat- ing intentional differentiation. The combined evi- dence suggests that, though the sets, subsets, and sums had a referential value and formed their own quantified system, within these groups or periods there were occasional points or moments of particu- larization. Upon completion of a set or sum there could be a marking that represented a superordinate meaning. Together, these represented corollary sym- bolic systems. These notations, then, were exceedingly complex, cognitively and culturally. Within the tradition, single unit marks could vary in their meaning according to their placement in the sequence, their angle, length, position above or below a conceptual line, or relation to nearby sets. In each of these uses of the single mark, a tradition and system of references is implied. Without making any deductions as to equivalence in meaning, it may be of value to note that historic record, tallying, or calendar sticks, such as the English Clogg Almanac, the Scandinavian rune stick, the. Yakut calendar stick, the Nicobarese calendar stick, and certain North American Indian painted skins or notched records, as well as mnemonic or tallying systems among contemporary primitive peoples such as the Australian Aborigines and the Eskimos, all operate within similar cognitive contexts. Early interpretations of the Upper Paleolithic sym- bolic materials were based on comparisons with the practices and images of historic primitive peoples. Such comparisons have validity, at a distance of thousands of years, only if they are comparisons of cognitive processes rather than attempts to explain the semantic meanings in the Upper Paleolithic com- positions. In contrast, the present study is based on an intensive internal analysis of the Upper Paleolithic materials. Each piece is analyzed individually and then compared with contemporary Upper Paleolithic materials. The cognitive and semantic contents are sought in the contemporary data. LATE MAGDALENIAN: CUETO DE LA MINA Up to this point, I have presented examples of relatively "pure" notation. The symbolic. materials of the Upper Paleolithic cultures, however, are exceed- ingly varied and complex. After a microscopic ex- amination of thousands of mobiliary artifacts, I have differentiated more than a dozen classes of image, symbol, and composition, each with its own frame of reference and usage. Studies on these specialized aspects are in press or in preparation (Marshack 1970b, c, d, 1971b, 1972a). Notations represent one class in this body of material. In terms of the number of documents, it is a minor class. In terms of its significance for a study of early cognition and symbol Vol. 13- No. 3-4* June-October 1972 455</page><page sequence="12">usage it may be the most important, in large part because its finite structures permit us to begin the analysis. I close the present study with an example that documents some of the associated meanings in the notational tradition, with a clue as to some of the meanings in Upper Paleolithic art. From the Late Magdalenian site of Cueto de la Mina in the Asturias region of Spain there comes a baton (17 cm), with the hole broken off, engraved in a seemingly cabalistic, "geometric" manner (Vega del Sella 1916:Pl. xxxix, 2a, b; P1. xl). Microscopic analysis reveals that it was engraved to form two "faces," each of which contains notations that are divided into sets and subsets (Fig. 15a, b). These sets are made by different points, in different styles, sizes, angles, pres- sures, and directions. Each major set is associated with a different image, either an animal or a plant; the exception is a double set in mid-baton on the first face dividing that surface in two. Each of the images is recognizable and serves as the referent or explana- tion for its associated group of marks. In this respect, the images serve much as did the subsidiary linear marks or abstracted linear forms on the pebble from Barma Grande, the ivory from Gontzi, and the sec- ond face of the Isturitz baton. They are symbols used with notation, but of a different, supplementary or- der. The images include two schematic ibex heads, seen front face and lacking eyes. The larger head is ap- parently a male and is intentionally struck through or crossed out. The smaller, more delicate head may be a female or a young ibex. There are also four plant images, each differentiated according to species and, apparently, stage of growth. One of the plants has a "subsidiary" sign associated with it, recalling the sub- sidiary mark that crosses out the first ibex head (Fig. 1 6a-J). The sequence of engraving on each face begins at the top at the thick end near the hole and proceeds downward. In the progressive accumulation, each image may have been engraved as the explanation for the marks that would follow. It is clear, then, that the images, like the notations, were made in sequence over a period of time and that, though they are recognizable images, they are not elements in a design or an art composition. Apart from these images, the accumulation on the baton is cognitively comparable to accumulations we have already analyzed. The presence of a series of recognizable images helps to clarify one aspect of the notational tradition and certain meanings in Upper Paleolithic art. The plant images eliminate early hy- potheses concerning hunting tallies. It would seem, instead, that the images represent storied explana- tions and myths summing their associated marks. They may thus have been related to seasonal, eco- nomic, or ritual recognitions or activities. Without attempting a limited or a limiting inter- pretation of the images or notations (Marshack 1971b, 1972a), I think it possible to state that the evidence presented in this paper documents a num- ber of complex cognitive-symbolic solutions to certain quantified and sequential problems and permits the tracing of a development in the complexity of the cultural forms involved. This evidence makes it ap- parent that simplistic and heuristic explanations of the Upper Paleolithic engraved materials in terms of "magic," "religion," "art," "decoration," "tallying," or "sexual symbolism" do not adequately define or ex- plain the data. My hypothesis concerning these notations, present- ed tentatively some years ago, is that they often represent an observational lunar notation (Marshack 1964). Since the new technology of microscopic anal- ysis frequently allows a determination of finite sets and subsets and their sequence of making, it is /6 ~ d 'S~~~~~~~~~~r I'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1 /0 a b FIG. 15.

A detailed study of the notational problem in these terms appears in a monograph devoted to methodology (Marshack 1971 b) and in more popular form in a book (Marshack 1972a). The lunar hypothesis suggests that the Upper Paleolithic notations represent one class of symbol and therefore a specialized cultural usage of the general cognitive capacity. The evidence suggests that this capacity for sequential and periodic conceptual- ization was at a comparable stage of development among different groups in different environments and regions. The body of mobiliary materials docu- ments the presence of other forms of symbolic mark- ing, including nonlunar notations, and these were apparently used in their own specialized contexts. COGNITIVE IMPLICATIONS The evidence for a tradition of notation in ubiquitous use in Upper Paleolithic Europe from Aurignacian times to the terminal Magdalenian raises profound questions concerning the evolution of man's cogni- tive-intellectual capacity and the level of symbolic development in these early H. sapiens cultures. They are of a different order than the questions which have till now been asked separately concerning the evolu- tion of language and tool-making, for questions con- cerned with the making and the meaning of notations are integrative and entail the full constellation of human cognitive skills. If, as seems indicated, notation and symbol usage in the Upper Paleolithic should prove to have been more complex than among the remnant, scattered hunting and gathering peoples of historic times (Bushman, Australian Aborigine, Eskimo, and many American Indian and Southeast Asian groups), it could place these early European cultures in a cen- tral, comparatively dynamic, formative, and revolu- tionary role in relation to later cultural developments, a role that today's isolated, peripheral, and static hunting-gathering peoples cannot be considered to play. This brief formulation raises still another series of questions. Within the limitations of the sparse and selective evidence presented in this paper, we can make certain inferences and deductions that will have relevance to the beginning inquiry and discussion. We have the evidence for an open, variable system of notation. In general cognitive terms we can say that the "purpose" of these notations was the sequential accumulation of sets, subsets, and superordinate sums. These were differentiated by a complex series of visual-kinesthetic and spatial-temporal inputs, re- calls, recognitions, and feedbacks. The process as- sumes "product" form by the use of a number of engraving techniques. These are as diverse as the differentiating use of the edges and faces of a plaque; the differentiating size, shape, angle, pressure, direc- tion, and rhythm of marking a set; the use of contain- ing lines, lines of separation, and accumulating lines; the structuring of recognizable conceptual shapes; and a use of supplemental signs, marks, symbols, and images to clarify the range of meanings in a notation. Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING Together these uses imply a sense of recurrence and periodicity as well as a sense of constancy within the open, variable system. In this paper I am assuming no knowledge of the semantic contents, but we can begin the next stage of analysis without it by simply accept- ing the notations as normal cognitive products of the fully evolved, genetically modern human brain. Studies in neuropsychology (Luria 1966a, b, 1970; Geschwind 1964, 1965, 1967) have differentiated many of the localized areas and structures involved in those cognitive processes which are evidenced in the Upper Paleolithic notations. These studies are in large part based on the behavioral effects of localized brain lesions, which selectively destroy or disturb the normal functioning of such aspects of the cognitive process as the visual, kinesthetic, spatial, rhythmic, sequential, integrative, and others. These neuro- psychological studies do not explain evolved human cognition, but they do isolate its components and indicate its physical, material basis. Generally, the sensory discriminations involved in cognition occur in the rear parts of the cortex, the area involved in the analysis, coding, and storing of input information. This area is divided into primary zones that sort and record, secondary zones that organize and code, and tertiary zones that combine and synthesize. Lesions in this third zone, for in- stance, can cause visual-spatial disorientations that affect a complex range of cognitive processes. At a higher level, the ability to plan and then carry through a culturally outlined conceptual program such as occurs in the making and use of a notation is localized in the associative areas of the frontal lobes and is disturbed by lesions that do not affect the other, more basic, cognitive functions. Since the Upper Paleolithic notations are chrono- logically early, that is, prewriting and prearithmetic, but are nevertheless a culturally complex product of man's general cognitive capacity, it may be of value to indicate some of the separate, specialized neuro- psychological structures and processes that function both in the early notations and in later cultural products such as true writing and reading, formal arithmetic, and modern pattern, symbol, and image use and recognition. Many areas of the brain participate in the act of formal writing. Crucial to alphabetical writing are the visual, kinesthetic, and auditory areas of the cortex, since the phonetic elements of speech (phonemes) must be recoded and arranged into optic elements or letters (graphemes), which must be translated into the act of writing with "maintenance of the topological characteristics and spatial coordinates" of the cul- turally established grapheme system. "Every graph- eme has its own particular visual-spatial structure, whose realization requires complex spatial analysis" (Luria 1966a:409). But not all writing is phonetic. Chinese is ideographic and has no need for a phone- mic analysis of words (Luria 1 966a:410-1 1): Its conventional signs do not record the phonetic composi- tion of words but, instead, denote ideas.. . .Phonetic anal- Vol. 13.

The central (kinesthetic) region of the left hemi- sphere controls the articulation of speech, and a lesion here affects the ability to do alphabetical writ- ing, which is learned and performed with an articula- tion of sounds. Patients with lesions in the occipital- parietal lobes can analyze the necessary speech sounds but have difficulty in recognizing and forming the written letters, since they cannot visualize the structure and the spatial relationship of the image parts. Lesions in the anterior region of the left hemisphere cause difficulties with the analyses re- quired for a proper sequencing of the letters to form a word. A related but different difficulty occurs with lesions in the prefrontal region of the "motor ana- lyzer," in which the capacity for "kinetic organiza- tion," that is, the ability to carry out rhythmic move- ments and the writing of letters in their serial order, is disturbed. Patients with lesions of the frontal lobes are disturbed conceptually and cannot understand or express organized complex sequential thoughts, eith- er in speech or writing. These data are based on lesions affecting formal writing, but the same in- tegrated visual-kinesthetic-spatial and conceptual ele- ments appear also in the prewriting notations. One might assume, therefore, that the ability to notate a discriminated set, whether as a series of parallel lines (/////) or as a series of running angles (/V ), represents a learned kinetic synthesis. The reading of a written language (and presum- ably also the reading of a complex, prewriting nota- tion) uses a different sequence of associations, though many of the same areas of visual-kinesthetic-spatial and sequential analysis are involved. Luria states (p. 412) that "reading follows the course of words [we may here add "sets"] to thoughts. It begins with the analysis of the ready made . . . (and) is transformed into the meaning" by a complex series of integrative associations. In some reading disorders based on local lesions the perception of letters and the recognition of their visual cues disintegrate. In another disorder the letters are recognized but words cannot be under- stood; in still another the words are recognized but cannot be uttered. When there is a breakdown in kinesthetic synthesis, the organization of the letters into syllables is affected. With frontal lobe lesions a body of text, that is, a composition, cannot be or- ganized conceptually. The analysis of the Upper Paleolithic notations has indicated that while they do not yet constitute formal writing or formal arithmetic, they are nevertheless cognitively related to them and may thus be their cultural precursors. In this regard, we will touch briefly on the neuropsychological disorders involved in arithmetical thinking, since they are related to writing disorders but have their own specialized ef- fects. Lesions in the occipital-parietal areas create a varie- ty of spatial disturbances involving visual-kinesthetic interrelations, among them an inability to differen- tiate to the right of/to the left of, vertical/horizontal, before/after, front/rear, and the arrangement of complex shapes (Luria 1966a: Chap. 3E). We have seen that these differentiations are crucial to the notational process. Lesions in the above area can create difficulties both in modern arithmetical think- ing and in modern logical-grammatical thinking, since each requires an ability to integrate or concep- tualize complex sequences or compositions that con- tain spatial relationships. According to Luria (1966a: Chap. 10), modern arithmetical thinking requires an ability to operate with spatially defined coordinates and concepts; the prearithmetic notations, though they do not operate with numbers, do operate with similar cognitive processes in the visualization of sets, subsets, sums, directional sequencing, and the placement of subsidiary signs, symbols, and aids. Since language structures also require an ability to grasp spatial relations, the documented cognitive complexity in the notations may indicate something concerning the possible complexity of language in- volved in maintaining the semantics of the system. Luria (1970:78) states that the same principles as apply to arithmetical thinking apply to language: In order to grasp the difference between "father's brother" and "brother's father" or between "summer comes after spring" and "spring comes after summer"... one must make a clear analysis of the quasi-spatial relations between the elements in each expression. In this sense, the establishment of conceptual models of kin relationships or of process relationships would utilize many of the evolved cognitive capacities evi- denced in the notations. This capacity for dealing with modern logical or arithmetical problems can be disturbed by lesions in the motor analyzer zone, even though spatial refer- ents are maintained intact. In this case kinesthetic difficulties affect the "kinetic melody" required to sustain internal speech, a process that is necessary for carrying through operations with linguistic content. Since every complex notation, as suggested earlier, tells an accumulating story and has a quasi-logical development with corollary linguistic input, this as- pect of successful notation would be affected by such lesions. A related aspect of cognition concerns images, symbols, art, and representation. Localized lesions of the frontal lobes can make it difficult to correctly perceive the relevant patterns in a single pictorial composition or to recognize the culturally established and individually learned relationships being depicted in that picture. These elements or contents of a picture represent what I call "story" and are present in a large proportion of Upper Paleolithic thematic compositions (Marshack 1972a). Since the notations, with or without image and symbol, were clearly intended to mean something, we can assume frontal lobe participation in the engraving and reading, involving coded sequences of learned cultural inputs. Frontal lobe lesions may also make it difficult to recognize or follow the development of a theme which is represented by a series of images or by 458 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="15">separate pictorial compositions (such as occur often on the separate faces or among diverse areas ol Upper Paleolithic compositions). Patients may recog- nize and name each image and yet be unable tc maintain the effort to conceptualize or categorize the image symbolically and in terms of the pictured theme, or be unable to follow the theme in terms of the sequencing of images (Luria 1966a: Chap. 12B). On the linguistic plane such frontal lobe lesions may affect the ability to understand metaphors and myth- ological constructs. Lesions in other areas affect the ability to understand thematic material in different ways, depending on the functions of the region affected. In general, however, the higher, conceptual, learned and cultural forms of intellectual activity arc too complex for satisfactory explanation in terms of the somewhat static and still early data derived from the effects of local lesions. Geschwind (1964, 1965, 1967) has attempted to increase our understanding of these processes by a study not only of the direct behavioral effects of local lesions but of the functional interrelations and pathways between the specialized areas of the brain, including those between the highly evolved association areas and those to the primary receptor and limbic areas. He tentatively suggests a central role in higher activity for the angular gyrus, a cortical association area that is late both in its evolu- tionary development and its myelinization or matura- tion in the individual. He calls this area, situated at the junction of three association areas, the visual, the auditory, and the somesthetic (which receives kines- thetic and cutaneous inputs), "the association cortex of the association cortexes" (1964:165). Geschwind notes that this junction and pathway, significantly evolved only in man, in large part makes possible aspects of speech and symbol usage requiring an interchange of data between the other systems or modalities. This ongoing, contemporary mapping of specialized structures, processes, and interrelations in the brain is slowly increasing our knowledge of spe- cies-specific cognition in man and, by implication, of the cognitive contents that may be found in the Upper Paleolithic notations. Another level of insight and reference is obtained by the study of man's cognitive behavior in living situations in present cultures. Piaget's studies of cog- nition in the child have revealed certain basic se- quences in the maturation of preverbal and nonver- bal logical and cognitive capacities as well as later sequences of development in linguistic strategies (Piaget 1952-67; Piaget and Inhelder 1963; Piaget, Inhelder, and Szeminska 1960). These include the development of the concepts of quantity, order, se- (luence, numeration, categorization, constancy and conservation, equivalence, duration, and space and geometry. Aspects of these concepts, as we have seen, are implied in the notations. To the extent that these findings of maturational sequences tally with those of neuropsychology in the study of adult cognition and with the evidence for the late maturation of cortical structures and areas involved in cognition, we can probably assume that the Upper Paleolithic notations are the products of acculturated adults. Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING Bruner (1966a, b; Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin 1956; Bruner, Oliver, and Greenfield 1966) has re- fined Piaget's findings by showing that the conceptual strategies developed by children after a certain age are strongly dependent on the cognitive complexities, equations, and technologies of the culture. Crucial among these are the linguistic-semantic inputs. He and his colleagues have shown that there are signifi- cant differences between the cognitive strategies of the rural and urban child, the Western and the nontechnical, the schooled and unschooled (Bruner, Oliver, and Greenfield 1966). He has indicated that the development of cognitive strategies depends on a child's changing levels of "imaging" reality (Bruner 1966b: 126-27): I shall call [these] three modes of representation [of reality] enactive representation, iconic representation, and symbol- ic representation. Their appearance in the life of the child is in that order, each depending upon the previous one for its development, yet all of them remaining more or less intact throughout life.... By enactive representation I mean a mode of representing past events through ap- propriate motor response [motor-kinesthetic learning].... Such segments of our environment-bicycle riding, tying knots, aspects of driving-get represented in our muscles, so to speak. Iconic representation summarizes events by the selective organization of percepts and of images, by the spatial, temporal, and qualitative structures of the percep- tual field and their transformed images. Images "stand for" perceptual events in the ... conventionally selective way that a picture stands for the object pictured. Finally, a symbol system represents things by design features that include remoteness and arbitrariness. If other studies have indicated the level of evolved cognitive capacity, Bruner has indicated how that capacity is shaped by a culture and is used in that culture (Bruner 1966b: 153,151): What is significant about the growth of mind in the child is to what degree it depends not upon capacity but upon the unlocking of capacity by techniques that come from ex- posure to the specialized environment of a culture. .. . Children, as they grow, must acquire ways of represent- ing the recurrent regularities in their environment, and they must transcend the momentary by developing ways of linking past to present to future-representation and integration... .We can conceive of growth in both of these domains as the emergence of new technologies for the unlocking and amplification of human intellectual powers.... Language, after a certain age, is the primary technol- ogy, both for culturation and participation; (p. 152) it shapes, augments, and even supersedes the child's earlier modes of processing information. Translation of expe- rience into symbolic [linguistic] form, with its attendant means of achieving remote reference, transformation, and combination, opens up realms of intellectual possibility that are orders of magnitude beyond the most powerful image- forming system." Because of the cognitive complexity implied in the Upper Paleolithic notations at each of Bruner's 1ev- Vol. 13- No. 3-4 June-October 1972 459</page><page sequence="16">els-the enactive-kinesthetic, the iconic, and the sym- bolic-we can probably assume that they required a rather high level of language usage, adequate to maintain and explain the tradition, to give meaning to any particular combination of sets, subsets, and sums, to explain the repertoire of associated symbols, and to incorporate the notations into related human activities. The direct evidence for the supporting language structures implied in the notations is lost, but the common cognitive elements within the widespread notations can, nevertheless, be reconstructed and studied. To some extent, this sort of reconstruction of cognitive elements, strategies, and sequences is intui- tively performed by specialists in the technology of paleolithic tool-making. The difference is that the notations are at a higher and more complex level of symbol-making. Fran?ois Bordes has informed me that one cannot properly "explain" paleolithic tool- making, one must "do it" and learn the kinesthetic and cognitive sequencing and problem-solving non- verbally. Despite a lack of verbalization, an evolved cognitive capacity is implied. In contrast, one can assume that, to a large degree, one could and did "explain" the notations. At a somewhat higher level are the patterns of "logic" in the use of cultural equations revealed by the studies of primitive mythic models and of mytholo- gized cultural structures initiated by Levi-Strauss (1961-69b). Since these studies are primarily com- parative analyses of cultural products rather than of individual cognitive processes, they tend to be myth- centered and therefore admittedly themselves a "kind of myth" (1969b:6) that takes the myth for the reality and looks within it for the "constraining structures of the mind" (p. 10). Accepting the validity of Levi- Strauss' insights at the level at which he presents them, it may be possible to assume that, though the styles of engraving a notation differed regionally and temporally through the Upper Paleolithic, a certain similarity in the "logical," mythic forms and processes would have existed in the diverse tellings or explana- tions. We can make this assumption because a com- plex nQtational series is always the outline for a storied sequence or process, one that is familiar to the maker and is explainable in his culture. Every nota- tion is, in one sense, a mythic model. No matter what it was that was being notated, the mythic content of the explanation would follow the rules of myth- making. At still another level, the presence of an evolved system of notation implies a corollary structuring in cultural activity. A notation always involves more than a telling and mythologizing; it is also a utilitarian, technological device. To the extent that these nota- tions are "time-factored," that is, accumulated se- quentially over an extended period, they imply a periodic, repetitive, or recurrent cultural activity. Whether a notation is a mnemonic device for periodic recall of remembered events, a score-keeping device in a well-known game, a message stick for transmit- ting intertribal information, a tallying device for recording the periodic exchange of gifts, or a calen- dric device for recording the sequence of seasonal, economic, ritual, or biologic processes, it indicates a level of evolved, storied, periodic human interrela- tion and communication. The maintenance of a developing notational tradi- tion across a span of 25,000 years, from early Aurig- nacian to terminal Magdalenian, would seem to imply a developing complexity of the structured interrela- tions of which the notations were a part. On the basis of the few examples of notation presented in this paper it may not be possible to infer a particular level of interpersonal, intergroup relation and complexity. But we can, perhaps, tentatively speculate that the examples of notation presented would be of less value to an isolated, barely subsisting nuclear family than to specialized groups or persons involved in storied, traditional, recurrent interrelations and interactions. The extent of the interrelational complexity im- plied in these notations will be presented in later studies documenting the range of Upper Paleolithic symbolism. The artifactual, symbolic repertoire in- cludes decorated tools, costume pieces, symbolic pen- dants, ritual objects, painted, carved and engraved animal, female, and anthropomorphic images, ab- stracted signs and symbols, non-notational ritual marking, a symbolic periodic use of caves and other specialized areas, grave and burial symbolism, and so on. In the light of this body of symbolic materials, it is possible that the notations played a minor part in the daily, conscious, emotional and intellectual living-out of an Upper Paleolithic life. They were, after all, a technological-conceptual device, much like the mod- ern measuring rod, watch, calendar, or arithmetic system. They were adjuncts in the structuring of the cultural and economic life and are therefore a mea- sure of the complexity of that life rather than an indication of the conscious core of that complexity. This would be particularly true if they were main- tained by specialized persons for specialized uses. Since I am using the notations to document and infer a certain level of cognitive capacity and cultural complexity, I note in closing that they operated within an artificial, culturally created microworld, involving a miniaturization and a visual abstraction of many concepts. This miniaturization represents a culturally specialized use of the species capacity. It is the visual-kinesthetic-spatial and the temporal- sequential elements in these miniaturized notations that represent the more general species capacity. These are the elements that re(quire fine differentia- tions in the use of eye, brain, two hands, and a tool. The cognitive discriminations are perhaps com- parable in delicacy and complexity to the audio-tonal differentiations of phonemes in spoken language, but they are of a different type and, as suggested by Luria, use many other areas and structures of the brain. We can assume that the nonverbal, visually ori- ented cognitive capacity apparent in the notations would have been used by Upper Paleolithic man also in the physical macroworld. In fact, this high level of cognition may have been evolved for success and survival in the macroworld (Holloway 1966). An evolving capacity for visual-spatial and time-factored interrelational inference would have been necessary 460 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="17">not only for an evolving tool technology but for the deepening understanding and structuring of the hunting and gathering territory, for a later delimiting of a symbolic territory, and for the recognition of the complex patterns of the sky, the seasons, and the biologic processes of man and nature. SUMMARY The evidence for a ubiquitous tradition of Upper Paleolithic notation would seem to verify a modern level of cognitive capacity and symbolic usage in early, Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING prewriting, prearithmetic phases of sapiens culture. The complexity of the tradition in the typical Aurig- nacian implies an earlier origin. The later complexi- ties of the tradition in the terminal Magdalenian may indicate that formal writing, arithmetic, and the true calendar, which appear in the first agricultural civili- zations, may have had reference to this earlier sym- bolizing tradition, one that was at least 25,000 years old. The level of cognitive capacity apparent in these early notations poses a crucial problem in the broad search for the factors involved in the evolution of man. Comments by CARLOS ALONSO DEL REAL* Santiago de Compostela, Spain. 14 xii 71 Marshack's paper is very good. I think that it puts us on the right path for eventually understanding "graphical signs" as distinguished from "writing." Therefore, and in support of his basic thesis, I consider myself obliged to offer some bibliographic additions that are surprisingly missing (I say "sur- prisingly" because the author does not have the irritating habit of others of quoting only books in English): Dir- inger (1962), for the distinction be- tween "graphical sign" and "writing"; Fester (1962), for the specifically lin- guistic implications; Laming-Empe- raire (1962) and Leroi-Gourhan (1965), for the disposition and fre- quency of figures and symbols in art, which back up Marshack's thesis with special emphasis; Leroi-Gourhan (1943, 1945), which will come in handy to clarify to what extent the raw mater- ial conditions the form of the signs (as Marshack has so precisely indicated in the case of the Parpall6 example); and Leroi-Gourhan (1964-65), for the problem as a whole. My fellow researcher VAzquez Varela asks me to observe that the paper at hand is of high quality and is a substantial new clue to the knowl- edge of the culture of Homo sapiens. This study should be complemented with a study of Paleolithic art, especial- ly of the possible graphical signs that appear in it. From the combination of these studies may come new light on the problem of graphical signs and the proto-forms of writing. by EMMANUEL ANATI' Capo di Ponte, Italy. 6 i 72 Marshack illustrates again, in this ar- ticle, his working methods, intended to lead to an understanding of the mark- ings upon Upper Palaeolithic stone, bone, and antler objects. He began his study by making an important ob- servation: that notation marks upon Upper Palaeolithic objects rather fre- quently are accumulations of groups of signs, in which each group has different technical characteristics. As he says, he has analysed thousands of objects, grouping together assem- blages of marks and differentiating the groupings. This, in itself, is a very valuable achievement, and a complete corpus of the Upper Palaeolithic nota- tional objects, presented in this way, would be a substantial contribution to the study of "prehistoric art"; such a corpus would in fact provide the raw material for a systematic quantitative and statistical analysis of the data that might lead to an understanding of their meaning. The descriptive part of the article is rather disconnected from the second part, called "Cognitive Implications," which is written in a different way, with a different approach, and in a different state of mind. I would agree with some of the general conclusions, although it seems to me that the same conclusions could have been reached more efficiently with less verbiage and less divergence from the rmain track. The main element that comes out is that the markings must have had some specific purpose. Probably the entire set of graphic manifestations which conventionally go under the label of "prehistoric art" played a prominent part in daily life. Therefore I see no reason to dissociate the "notational as- semblages" from the rest of the "figu- rative," "schematic," and "abstract" figurations. Marshack says again, without elabo- rating, that these notations "represent observational lunar notations." This theory has already been discussed (Balout et al. 1970:539-47); a convinc- ing elaboration of the idea would be welcome. Similar ideas have been pro- posed separately, by Frolov (1970: 475-78), but in this case, too, have not been demonstrated. Marshack states in his article, no less than 16 times, that his discoveries were made possible only by the microscope. From my own experience I have learned that enlargements of con- siderable size may be useful for study- ing details of mechanical stress and behaviour of raw material. Technical differences, of cross-sections, pressure, and twisting, caused by different movements of the human hand, are frequently visible to the naked eye; the best way to observe them is with a magnifying glass which enlarges 8-12 times and good photographic enlarge- ments of the same size (stereoscopic if possible). Strokes 1 cm. long, with sec- tions of 1/2 to 1 mm., can be studied very well when they are seen 10 cm. long, with a section of 1/2 to 1 cm. Stronger enlargements would make it difficult to define and compare mor- phological characteristics. Even dots 1 mm. in diameter are likely to lose their shape when they are magnified more than 10 times. An area of 4 s(l. cm., which is the average size for a nota- tional complex, when enlarged 10 times, becomes an area of 400 sql. cm., and this is frequently enough for a thorough study. From the kind of doc- uments he uses, it seems that Mar- shack probably agrees with this ap- proach. Regarding the chronological at- tribution of the objects studied and their absolute dating, I would like to see less categoric statements. The most important question raised by Marshack's work, at this stage, is: are there differences in the notational structure in the various periods and geographical areas studied? Is there an evolution of the notational concept from 35,000 to 10,000 years ago? By now, no doubt, Marshack has enough data at his disposal to make a clear, reasoned, and documented statement on this point. Marshack's research, part of which is described in this article, is a valuable contribution to the study of "prehis- toric art," and I am looking forward to seeing the completion of the corpus. Vol. 13- No. 3-4 . June-October 1972 461</page><page sequence="18">by DAVID S. BROSE* Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A. 30 xii 71 Marshack has proposed that consider- able significance be attached to the variations in engraving technique, and that groups of marks made by similar technique form cognitive sets or sub- sets. His hypothesis must rest on his ability to demonstrate that these mark- ings are not (1) random, (2) accidental, (3) decorative, or (4) artistic. That he claims these conditions are not appli- cable is insufficient. Clearly these markings are not accidental. Just as clearly, they are both artistic (es- pecially the baton from Cueto de la Mina) and decorative (e.g., the Barma Grande pebble) in every sense of those terms except the most ethnocentric. What Marshack wishes to state is that they are more than decorative and artistic. This remains to be demon- strated. It is most unfortunate that the "arithmetical and statistical tests" of the significance of technical variation and subset periodicity (Mar,shack 1971 b, 1972a) have not been included, or at least summarized, in this article. Where no repetitive pattern exists, the entire process may be random or idio- syncratic. It becomes impossible to verify the nonrandom significance of the marks in the absence of such data for all engraved pieces from the Upper Paleolithic, not just those which are presumed to be notational. To some extent it is disturbing that (p. 449) "during seven years of research no notational compositions . . . were found to contain the same breakdown of groups in sequence...." While this could be used to argue the open na- ture of the system, it could also indi- cate the random nature of such mark- ings. Nor does this lack of structuring stem from the variables of time and/or space: Marshack has noted that this statement applies to various pieces from a single archaeological occupa- tion. Granting for the moment Mar- shack's hypotheses that subsets repre- sent nonrandom, culturally controlled variables, one may still question linear accumulation in both the theoretical and the technical sense. Marshack has presented no evidence to demonstrate the cognitive quantification of the dis- crete subsets ("groups") into any su- perordinate sum. Nor has he demon- strated that they are conceptually re- lated on any single piece. His analyses indicate that in many cases such "com- position" accumulated over unspeci- fied periods of time. What evidence indicates that they were made by any single individual? How could one distinguish such sets from contem- poraneous cognitively unrelated representations which seem to form groups (e.g., the cervids, bovids, and equids at Lascaux), or may actually be superimposed on a single object (e.g., the La Colombiere pebble [Movius 1961] )? What reason is there to be- lieve all such "notational sets" begin at one end and continue (cumulatively) to the other end of the "image," rather than representing multiple origins and mergings? In this respect one might note that the "point-of-turning set" on the Abri Blanchard plaque may also be interpreted as a totally different square cognitive element, not merely a bent linear element. It may also repre- sent two distinct cognitive events, pos- sibly unrelated to each other except for chance location: in this interpreta- tion, nine sets of the 26 represented in Figure 4, rather than seven out of 25 sets, would be composed of two ele- ments. The application of basic non- parametric tests indicates that these two distributions are statistically indis- tinguishable (chi-square = .326: df = 4: p &gt; .99; Spearman's rank order coefficient = .825). Claims for linear accumulation, then, are not unequivo- cally supported by the analysis pre- sented, and the entire concept of lin- earity or (mythically) additive sets re- mains an untested hypothesis. Neither can the concept of a serpentine image be uncritically accepted, and therefore nothing substantive can be said of ma- jor, introductory, or subsidiary group- ings. In terms of the analytical method itself, Marshack does not demonstrate the sequence of engraving except in cases of superimposition. The Abri Lartet plaque need not have been first edge-worked, for there are clear edge areas in the "dot-zone" on both faces which could indicate that the dots were made first, with later linear edge work in blank areas. Also, not all of the lines of dots run down or up to the linear edge marks. It is also unclear why the central group of nine dots on the second face is the last set made. Again, on the Aurignacian A 212 plaque the overlapping of linear sets may also suggest that there is no planning of the entire assemblage; that there is no cognitive relationship between the sets, which should then be considered independent events; and that there- fore any analysis of the entire concat- enation will be meaningless. Furthermore, it is also possible that the quasi-representational flora as- sociated with the fauna on the Cueto de la Mina baton may serve to mark the habitat of particular individuals or animal species. This would not elimi- nate the hypothesis of hunting tallies. Neither has there been any good evi- dence produced to indicate that the Parpall6 pebble is not a gaming piece (or that the Spanish Solutrean utilized marine and/or estuarine resources [Obermaier 1925:172-73, 195-96] ). In fact, that piece resembles an elabo- ration of numerous "tectiforms" from the Franco-Cantabrian area and thus may possibly be a representation of structures: recent excavations at open-air sites in southwest France are beginning to reveal the considerable size and complexity of late Upper Paleolithic structures (F. Bordes, per- sonal communication). In summary, Marshack's hypothesis of an open, variable system of notation with a cognitive analog of sequent ac- cumulation in the Upper Paleolithic is interesting. It represents a new and valuable interdisciplinary approach to one of the major, and most difficult, problems of paleoanthropology. Mar- shack presents us for the first time a detailed analysis revealing new dimen- sions in the scientific investigation of this period, as opposed to philosophi- cal speculation. But the data needed to test the hypotheses are simply not available in the article. Nor is there any clear statement of exactly how such hypotheses could be tested. by J. K. CLEGG and J. PETER WHITE* Sydney, Australia. 21 xii 71 Marshack deserves congratulations for (a) extracting much information from common objects previously ignored and (b) attempting to use archaeologi- cal evidence to solve a problem in behavioural genetics, namely the evo- lution of the capacity of certain ways of seeing. But we wish to draw attention to three problems with his work. 1. We propose a simpler explana- tion than the presence of a Homo sapiens sapiens cognitive capacity and a Eurasian cognitive tradition for the sets of marks Marshack identifies. We suggest that these marks could be made by craftsmen testing tools prior to use: with each new tool being tested a few marks are made on some vacant space on some piece of material similar to that about to be worked. We derive this suggestion from the fact that if anyone attempts to test an implement point he places it on a piece of wood, bone, or stone and twists it both ways. It depends on the form of the point whether it cuts best when twisted clockwise or anti-clockwise, and held vertically or at a slight angle. Assum- ing Palaeolithic engravers' motor hab- its were similar to ours, then the dif- ferences in "style" that Marshack notes would be due primarily to variations in the tools used rather than intentional, cognised, stylistic differences. A series of tool tests would build up dis- 462 C UR RE N T ANT H RO POLO G Y</page><page sequence="19">tinguishable sets of marks which are liable to exhibit statistical regularities but which convey no information about the cognitive capacities of their makers. We think that this explanation accounts for the Blanchard plaque in particular, as well as the "notational sequences on unworked, scrap pieces of bone, stone, antler, and ivory." Ad- ditionally, it accounts for the facts that no replication of sets has been ob- served even within small time-space units and that the "tradition" is itself widespread in space and time. 2. Marshack's Fig. 11 in particular seems to be closely analogous with certain Australian rock art (e.g., Mul- vaney and Golson 1971: Pls. XIX, XXI-XXIII; Mulvaney 1969: Pls. 77, 80-8 1). The "tradition" may not have developed in Eurasia only, or in that area first. 3. Even if Marshack's notational in- terpretations are accepted, we suggest that similar artistic productions may well be within the cognitive capacities of other primates (Morris 1962: Chap. 2 and p. 163). We are unconvinced that Marshack-marks are relevant to our understanding of the "sapieniza- tion" of H. sapiens sapiens. Only with representative art are we certainly studying specifically human works. by MALCOLM F. FARMER* Whittier, Calif., U.S.A. 12 i 72 Archaeological research is expanding rapidly in its geographical coverage, time depth, and methodology, and the results are adding new depth to the study of human behavior. The work of Marshack has contributed to the real- ization that the behavioral patterns of man reached a high level of accom- plishment at an early date and that such accomplishment reflects cognitive development. Anyone who has experi- mented with the manufacture of tools and other artifacts from stone, par- ticularly the flaking of a variety of materials, realizes that to produce a desired tool it is necessary not only to take advantage of the flaking potential but also to have an image of the de- sired shape. The image of the tool is within the mind of the stoneworker. With the image as the goal, he ex- amines the fragment in hand, then projects a plan-including a projected series of blows which will produce the desired tool from the particular piece of stone. The implication of this is that the man who shaped the tools of the past must have reached a stage of cognitive development which not only included memory, but also the ability to project events which had not yet occurred and to adjust that projection to the particular situation. Thus the presence of tools of some uniformity as early as 2,000,000 or more years ago suggests that important steps in cogni- tive development had occurred. Recent finds in Eurasia and Africa show that notational series were among the accomplishments of man by the later Paleolithic times and that the foundations for later systems had been established. A new look at the wall paintings and other "art" indicates that there is a potential for the study of much more detail which will reflect human cognitive development. Such data might even suggest some ideas concerning language. At what point language, in its present pattern or structure, became part of the behavior of man is at this time difficult to judge, but if correlations can be established between tool-making and its implica- tions and the capacities of the brain, it seems possible that language has its roots at a very early time, perhaps as adaptive behavior. The development of ethnoscience, ethnosemantics, the whole of ethno- methodology and cognitive anthro- pology, is laying the foundations for a more extensive treatment of the cogni- tive development of man. Such work as that of Gladwin (1970) with the people of Puluwat Atoll shows some of this potential. These efforts also show the need for coordination of studies within the tradition of anthropology. The approach which includes the in- teraction between the biological- physical, the cognitive, and the affec- tive development of man, not only of individuals but also over time, needs to be expanded. The work of Maria Montessori concerning the education- al needs of poor children in Rome shows the value of such coordination and the holistic anthropological ap- proach. Attention to detail like that in Marshack's work is needed in the study of other behavioral patterns in which artifacts which reflect aspects of such patterns are involved. by E. E. FRADKIN* Leningrad, U.S.S.R. 24 i 72 I find great interest in Marshack's study of the notches on bone plaques from a series of Paleolithic sites on the Eurasian continent. Many scientists have been interested in these notches, lines, and other traces undoubtedly made by a human hand. Some have thought that these traces of human activity were rudimentary elements of ornamentation; others have con- sidered them as elements of counting. In 1964, Marshack suggested that some of the notches on the plaques represent a record of lunar phases. In Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING the present work, he substantially en- larges and deepens his studies of the semantics of notches and lines on mo- biliary articles from the Upper Pale- olithic. The difficulty of interpretation of objects of Paleolithic art and articles carrying ornamentation, notches, or drawn lines is obvious. These articles are at present the only source of means to penetrate into the most dif- ficult domain of Paleolithic archeolo- gy-the spiritual culture. This is not only one of the most difficult fields of knowledge, but also one where suc- cessful solutions are not easily achieved because of the lack of satis- factory methods for solving semantic questions. That is why the possibility of solving such questions, and even the raising of such questions, are viewed sceptically by many scientists. The old device of comparison of Paleolithic articles with ethnographic materials, worked out at the dawn of the science of Paleolithic art and once very useful for the study of semantics, is now insufficient. The value of Marshack's work is in its attempt simultaneously to develop new methods and to solve semantic problems. By methods I mean not only the use of the microscope for studying the traces and character of human activity, but also the application of statistical and mathematical techniques. In my opinion, the method proposed by Marshack is of great interest and even now offers much both for the solv- ing of semantic problems and for the explanation of the process of mak- ing these peculiar "patterns" on the plaques. There is no doubt that the proposed method will be of great help to all who work in this field. It seems to me very convincing that the "serpentine" pattern was thought out beforehand and executed inten- tionally. The inference that such com- positions were not made all at one time is indisputable, and the term "time- factored" that he applies to such com- positions is very good. The study of more than 1,000 ob- jects and the classification of more than 100 of them has given Marshack good grounds for raising the problem of semantics. His inferences about the presence on the plaques of arithmeti- cal symbols of different orders are of great interest. The statement that the presence of these symbols implies the existence of a process of teaching them is very convincing. The whole study is extraordinarily thorough and logical. Perhaps it would be of interest to mention here some observations made Vol. 13- No. 3-4 * June-October 1972 463</page><page sequence="20">by Soviet archeologists on the basis of new methods of studying artifacts. Bibikova (1965) has established a rela- tion between Mezin ornamentation and the structure of the dentine of mammoth tusk through a study of the structure pattern in sections at differ- ent angles. I have used microscopic methods in order to determine the origin of notches on materials from the Paleolithic site Kostenki I. Owing to the microscope and to the method developed by S. A. Semenov, it was possible to state with certainty that the notches and lines on polyiconic Pale- olithic sculpture are artificial and to determine with what tools they were made (Fradkin 1969a, b; Korobkova 1969). Marshack's study is certainly very fruitful and has considerably enlarged our notions about Homo sapiens, his intellect and spiritual culture. by G. F. FRY* Youngstown, Ohio, U.S.A. 10 i 72 Marshack's argument is not entirely convincing, but neither is it entirely unconvincing. Few would argue with the viewpoint (p. 447) that Upper Paleolithic peoples wver-e "modern Homo sapiens functioning in a complex culture with fully evolved brain struc- tures and cognitive processes." How- ever, if Paleolithic engraving was a continent-wide system of notation, we would expect to see some patterns emerge, and none are apparent. Differences in engraved marks made by a chipped-stone tool in the heavy hand of an Upper Paleolithic big-game hunter seem great when viewed under a modern microscope, but would they have been significant to the maker? The human hand is in- capable of making microscopically identical engravings with a stone tool. Additionally, each use of a particular chipped-stone graver would effective- ly modify the working face of the tool. Each mark of the tool could easily indicate under the microscope a dif- ferent cut by a different tool. Thus, I cannot attach the same significance to microscopic differences between par- ticular engraved marks that Marshack does. On the other hand, the engravings may possibly represent mnemonic de- vices with meaning to the makers and even perhaps with some unknown qluantitative values. In this respect, these engravings may indicate an ad- vance in cognitive behavior. by SYLVIA J. HALLAM* Nedlands, Australia. 9 XII 71 Marshack would, no doubt, agree with Clarke (1968:12) that "archaeology, is archaeology, is archaeology." His con- clusions rest not on facile ethnograph- ic comparisons, but on intensive in- ternal analyses. Nonetheless, he does essay with brilliant success fields which, in the past, archaeologists have abandoned in despair to the ethnog- raphers. And if we agree, as we must, that "archaeology is, among other things, the time dimension of ethnolo- gy," then it is surely valid to include among the cross-sections we study along that dimension the near-past, which we misname the present. If symbolic sequential usage can be clari- fied for Europe 30,000 to 10,000 years ago, it should be similarly investigated for other areas. Where, as in Australia, we have demonstrably continuous (though not unchanging) traditions, such studies can validly be carried through from the Late Pleistocene to the near-present, giving new insights into cognitive anthropology, and at the same time deepening our understand- ing of "sequential and periodic con- ceptualisation" in the past by examin- ing the greater variety of evidence for recent "seasonal, economic, or ritual recognitions or activities." Marshack eschews "comparisons with the prac- tices and images of historic primitive peoples." Should he not rather en- courage the extension of the type of study he has inaugurated into areas showing both cultural change and con- tinuity, where it may be possible and legitimate to view the present as one arbitrary cross-section in the flow of archaeology into ethnology? Here the dynamics of symbolic structuring may be seen in the ecological and cer- emonial interaction of landed groups and peopled landscape. It is by no means a foregone conclu- sion that notational and symbolic usage in the European Upper Pala- eolithic will "prove to have been more complex than among the remnant, scattered hunting and gathering peo- ples of historic times." Marshack has opened our minds to new possibilities in archaeology, and we should keep them open, not closed, to the possibili- ties of similar investigations in other areas and over wider time spans which may embrace the present, or the eth- nographic near-present. He is certain- ly mistaken in regarding Australian Aboriginal societies as "static," how- ever relatively peripheral and isolated they may be, and he obviously under- estimates the complexity of their sym- bolic usage, just as previous investi- gators have underestimated that of the peripheral, relatively isolated, but nonetheless dynamic, hunting- gathering societies of Europe. The lack of plant cultivation in Aboriginal Australia has been seen as evidence of resistance to change (e.g., Lommel 1970). But it is precisely in the interaction of changing patterns of exploitation, ecological activity, land use, and landholding with environ- mental and demographic change that the Aborigines have shown greatest adaptability. Change (and continuity) in the ecological-cognitive-symbolic as- pects of group activity is reflected but dimly in the artefactual. Thomson's pioneer investigations (1939) stressed the complexity of eco- logical knowledge and skill shown by Aboriginal groups on the Cape York peninsula. In particular he described a "regular and orderly annual cycle car- ried out systematically" and matched by a similarly regular and precise vo- cabulary. In the southwest corner of the continent, the Aboriginal vocabu- lary recorded in detail by George Fletcher Moore in the 1830's (Moore 1884) similarly reflects "periodic, repetitive and recurrent" patterns of activity and usage. Space structuring was ecological-functional. On Cape York, plant associations had names. On the Swan, Moore recorded "Gon- gan," a sandy district," open country of easy movement, "the easiest road or path." "Narrik" was "ground ripe for burning," with abundant dry vegeta- tion, while "Nappal" was burned ground free from obstruction and "Kundyl" young grass springing up on the burned area after rain. Temporal structuring also viewed seasons in terms of human exploitative activity, movement, dispersion, and aggrega- tion. "Jilba" (August and September), when roots are the staple, gives place to "Geambarang" (October and No- vember), when young birds begin to be plentiful, and that to "Birok" (Decem- ber and January), the height of the summer season, when the Aborigines begin to fire the country for game; so to "Burnuro" (February and March), when mullet, salmon, and taylor-fish abound, "Wanyarang" (April and May), when the roots of flag, burnt by the summer fires, are in season, and "Maggaro" (June and July), the winter months, when kangaroo are hunted in the inland forests (Moore 1884; Nind 1831:128-36). Patterns of movement, aggregation, and exploitative and cer- emonial activity were as articulated as the vocabulary which reflected them. Precision of ecological, spatial, and temporal knowledge and skill was backed by astronomical lore. Various constellations were named and figured in myth, some (e.g., Castor and Pollux) throughout Australia and Tasmania, implying that the traditions originated in the Pleistocene before Tasmania was isolated. The Swan River Aborigi- nes distinguished and named at least 464 C UR RENT ANT H RO POLO G Y</page><page sequence="21">eight phases in the waxing and waning of the moon (Moore 1884:53). Vocabulary and seasonal economic and territorial behaviour reflected spatially, temporally, and functionally ordered cognitive patterns derived from and imposed on phenomena, and were integrally linked to complex symbolic (ritual, mythic, and artistic) patterning whereby that cognitive lore was maintained and transmitted. The moon, for instance, figured in wide- spread myths, waxing and waning, bringing death and regulating concep- tion, the seasons of earth and of women; a water-dwelling serpent, sometimes a halo to the waning moon, epitomised the powers of darkness and death, antithetic yet essential, in its male potency, to the female powers of fire and life linked with sun and earth. Increase rituals could involve fire ceremonies around a grave-womb, ochre-painting, scarification, and bloodletting "like rain" to revivify earth. The cuts might be on the chests of the participants (Arndt 1962:171); engraved "rain-cuts" on the shelter walls, e.g., in the Clarence Valley in New England (McBryde 1964); or a painted version of the same theme, as in Frieze Cave in Western Australia (Hallam 1971 c). Rows of parallel painted dashes adorned the rain- bringing Wandjinas and representa- tions of snakes in the Kimberleys (Crawford 1968:104, 109). The Clar- ence Valley engravings, including those at Seelands, where there was activity over the last 6,500 years (McBryde 1966), fall into groups, and, like those at Delamere in the Northern Territory, may be the products of a group of participants on each of a number of repeated occasions. The double, and in places triple, serpentine frieze of parallel vertical dashes run- ning from end to end of the 40-ft. rock-shelter of Frieze Cave defeats such an interpretation, but has de- monstrably undergone a sequence of paintings and repaintings. Sequential compositions in Aus- tralian art which should repay investi- gation with the problems in mind which Marshack has posed include the "grid" incisions at Koonalda, with an age of at least 20,000 years (Edwards and Maynard 1967; Wright 1971a, b), here associated with apparently ran- dom serpentine finger-markings, like those made in 1966 in association with fire ceremonies in the Western Desert (Gould 1969:121-28). The 1+3+1 patterning which the fingers give is repeated elsewhere, e.g., at Kintore and Cutta-Cutta (Walsh 1964, Mul- vaney 1969), where a smaller, sharper implement, perhaps an animal claw, was used. I have described (Hallam 1971 a, b) the Orchestra Shell Cave on the western coastal plain, where 1+3+1 sets of serpentine marks are associated with one group of seven short parallel lines and another of nine, and with fires back to 6,500 years ago. Sets of parallel and semi-parallel lines, grids, and concentric circles be- long to the oldest stratum of Aus- tralian "art" (Edwards 1971), a tradi- tion originating before Tasmania was cut off from the mainland about 10,000 B.C., and dated before 5,000 years ago at Devon Downs (Hale and Tindale 1930) and Ingaladdi (Mul- vaney 1969:209). We should not underestimate the cognitive capacities of groups capable of creating the intricate complexities of Aboriginal kinship systems, music, dance, ritual, or the web of mythic nodes and tracks which encompass Aboriginal life, land, and legend. "Storied, traditional, recurrent inter- relations and interactions" permeate present economic and ceremonial life; while the evidence of "art" and of burial ritual (Bowler et al. 1970) shows that certainly for 20,000, perhaps for 30,000, possibly for more years, a sym- bolic lore was among the conceptual tools by which Aboriginal groups re- acted to, manipulated, exploited, grasped, and structured their world. Marshack's insights should not lead us to revert to a Eurocentric view, but should rather open up a world prehis- tory of cognitive traditions. What will be the implications for our under- standing of the development of popu- lations with sapiens characteristics? by TERUYUKI Hojo* Fukuoka, Japan. 7 I 72 Marshack's exhaustive microscopic analysis of engraved and carved mo- biliary artifacts of bone and stone from the Upper Paleolithic of Europe re- veals the presence of periodic mark- ings. He suggests the hypothesis that some of them often represented lunar notations. He tries to trace the evolu- tion of man's cognitive-intellectual ca- pacity and the level of symbolic devel- opment in these early Homo sapiens cultures. I am very interested in his laborious work. The results of his studies seem to be in accord with evidence hitherto ob- tained in neuropsychological studies and in the study of man's cognitive behavior. In Japan, Hasebe (1930) once ad- vanced the ingenious theory that in the process of human evolution ac- quiring "the binding-cord-technique" Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING contributed to changing man's way of life. In his survey on folkways of the South Sea Islanders, Hasebe found that "the binding-cord-techniqlue" was very important not only in making implements, but also in symbolizing their ideas. He noted that they bound things with lines in many ways. It is impossible to know accurately the number of nerve cells and the functional organization of the brain by studying the shape of the brain case, though Upper Paleolithic man is esti- mated to be equal in volume of the brain to present-day man. Certainly, Upper Paleolithic man had a large number of nerve cells of the brain that could be utilized for the gradual devel- opment of his intellectual and symbol- ic capacity. by EDWARD HOSLEY* Seneca Falls, N.Y., U.S.A. 31 i 72 Marshack continues, with good results, his work on the reexamination of older materials and accepted inter- pretations (Marshack 1970a, c). I have very little in the way of criticism, as I find his argument and evidence im- pressively persuasive. One might ques- tion his interpretation of some of the plant and animal images (p. 456), or- ask to what degree the variety in nota- tion could be attributed to motor hab- its in different individuals, but I feel such polemics are unnecessary here. I will instead offer a few brief observa- tions intended to support Marshack's thesis. Since it is clear that the engravings were done with a variety of instru- ments of different cross-section, it would be helpful to know, from a study of contemporaneous artifacts, precisely what instruments were avail- able to the men of this period for such uses, and the correlation of finds of such tools with the engraved materials in the same sites. As by the Upper Paleolithic specific tools were being adapted for specialized functions, it is difficult to assume that engraving of the apparent importance of this type utilized simply any handy graver. On the other hand, the variety of gravers and techniques employed might also indicate (1) that this activity was of subsidiary importance or (2) that a single object was used for an appreci- able length of time. I am struck also by the support to be drawn for Marshack's thesis from con- sideration of the following: The en- graving activity and associated cogni- tive processes endured some 25,000 years, over a large part of Europe. Vol. 13. No. 3-4 June-October 1972 465</page><page sequence="22">Such an activity, once we accept the premise that it was notational, must have dealt with a constant phenome- non which was shared and extracul- tural. Such phenomena certainly would have included the behavior of game animals and of heavenly bodies. It would be difficult for men of the intellect implied by the consummate skill of their art and artifacts to avoid noting a possible correlation between the relative abundance of game and certain repetitive astronomical events. The solstitial variation in the sun's position would most certainly have been observed in Europe and related to seasonal differences, and that in turn to the movements of game and the growth of plants. This clearly would lead early to a concern with calendrical notation utilizing the most easily noted short-range variable-the lunar phases. Finally, I agree with Marshack when he states that this notation could be a precursor of writing (Marshack 1972b). The analogy between the tech- niques of the Upper Paleolithic en- gravers and those of the early users of cuneiform is easily drawn. The resem- blance between some of the forms illustrated by Marshack and those found in the early symbolic notation of the Middle East is striking, though probably fortuitous. It would be the most interesting to know the degree to which this engraving tradition occurs in Middle Eastern Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic contexts. by EVELYN S. KESSLER* Tampa, Fla., U.S.A. 28 xii 71 Marshack has broken new ground in his study of Upper Paleolithic engrav- ing. His article serves as a model of the types of meaningful data that can be extracted from archaeological contexts by careful techniques and a willingness to challenge preconceived notions. Arguments against attempted inter- pretations of ideational aspects of a culture by the archaeologist (Hawkes 1954:161-62) have been refuted by Binford and Binford (1968:21-23). Ethnographic material tends to show that decorative art, in less complex societies, is the expression of an at- tempt at group communication within a coherent tradition which is mean- ingful to members of a specific cultural group (Harris 1971:586-87). The rec- ognition of these facts has led Mar- shack to interpret what were formerly regarded as random artistic designs as a coherent system of notation, involv- ing symboi o1COgnition. The impact of Marshack's work is that, beyond sharing a tool tradition, Homo sapiens sapiens of the Upper Paleolithic also shared a system of communication, here documented for Europe and presumably to be docu- mented for other areas in the future (Solecki 1971:164). This should not surprise us. After all, man in the Upper Paleolithic is known to have been fully H. sapiens sapiens (Hulse 1963:227). Solecki (1971:269), among others, documents the fact that H. sapiens neandertalensis already demonstrated the capacity to communicate abstract concepts, such as are implied in burials accompanied by flowers, grave goods, and funeral feasts. Perhaps as techniques improve, and as social scientists become more willing to accept earlier forms of Homo as truly ancestral to modern man, we shall discover that the activities of H. sapiens neandertalensis were in them- selves based upon preexisting cogni- tive symbolization, as yet unrecog- nized, among H. erectus. The synthetic theory of evolution seems to indicate that evolution pro- ceeds by microevolutionary steps. The ability to symbolize, in man, must be viewed as having developed in the same evolutionary fashion as other human abilities. The problem lies in whether the archaeologist is capable of recognizing the evidence of rudi- mentary symbolization. Marshack has shown that this can be done. The refinement of his methods to the point where he can ascertain that marks were etched sequentially and at in- tervals has enormous potential for the restudy of artifacts heretofore clas- sified as "cult objects" or as exemplify- ing decorative techniques. One won- ders whether a modification of Mar- shack's technique might not be applied to Mesolithic painted pebbles and to the tectiforms and penniforms which appear in Upper Paleolithic cave art (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967:38). Marshack's theory that the notation involved in the material studied con- cerned lunar observations is, of course, well taken, given the knowl- edge of early civilizations' interest in astronomical data. However, I think it is well not to stress this at this early stage of our understanding of the no- tation system of early man. Further research may reveal an entirely differ- ent application for such a system, in that hunting man's need for astrono- my may have been considerably less than that of the early cultivators. My only criticism of Marshack's fas- cinating article is his statement (p. 457) that notation and symbol usage in the Upper Paleolithic "could place the early Europeans in a central, compara- tively dynamic, formative and revolu- tionary role in relation to later cultural developments." Marshack himself has studied similar notational systems in use at Shanidar Cave, in the Middle East (Solecki 1971:164). With the pub- lication of this seminal paper, there may well be a burgeoning of interest among archaeologists which could lead to the recognition of a wide ge- ographic distribution of Upper Pale- olithic notational symbols. Then we will be faced with the problem of dis- cerning how widespread the system was, and to what degree the system was mutually intelligible among the populations involved. Out of this there may well evolve the concept of a dy- namic interaction among populations in Upper Paleolithic times which should be more fruitful to our under- standing of cultural dynamics than the mere identification of a particular in- novator. by BJORN KURTPN* Helsinki, Finland. II i 72 The work of Marshack represents a significant breakthrough in the anal- ysis of Palaeolithic culture and the world of early man. It effectively points up the great antiquity of the characteristically human traits. The society of late Pleistocene Homo sapiens was already a highly evolved one, with an accumulated tradition of what we might now term art and science, to- gether with its material culture. Obvi- ously the roots lie much deeper than we used to think even a decade or two ago. As early as the Ramapithecus stage we already find an arched palate sug- gesting the presence of a well- developed tongue, one of the prere- quisites for articulation. by THOMAS F. LYNCH* Ithaca, N.Y., U.S.A. 4 i 72 1. The case for an open, variable sys- tem of "time-factored" notation is con- vincingly established by Marshack's application of microscopic inspection and common sense. It is easy to agree that such notation requires an evolved level of communication and is a mea- sure of the complexity of Upper Pale- olithic cognition. As Marshack ob- serves, these notations may not consti- tute writing or formal arithmetic, but they may be cultural precursors. I am less convinced that minute sequential notation is species-specific or proof in itself of fully evolved sapiens brain structure, cognition, or culture. 2. It is interesting that abundant documentation of notation and symbol use begins only with the Typical Aurignacian, supporting the obstinate view that it is appropriate to make a major division of the Paleolithic at this point (cf. Lynch 1966:182-94). Initia- 466 C UR RE N T ANT H RO POLO G Y</page><page sequence="23">tion of advanced systems of cognition and notation, in conjunction with the traditional markers of Aurignacian Upper Paleolithic status, would seem to outweigh the continuities from Mousterian and Chatelperronian stone industries which have recently been emphasized. Similarly, although 25,000 years of notational continuity may be hard to accept, integrity is lent to the European Upper Paleolithic through recognition of related, ubi- quitous systems of notation distributed across the regional and temporal di- versity of lithic cultures. 3. Thorough internal analysis of Paleolithic notation and symbol use is welcome and overdue, but compara- tive ethnography, and even cautious analogy, can still contribute. For one thing, had Marshack studied nota- tional systems of recent hunter- gatherers with equal intensity, I sus- pect he would be less convinced of their limitations. The promised anal- ysis of the problem of differentiating notation from decoration could be profitably supplemented by an intense study of recent, especially European, tallying, calendrical, and mnemonic devices. 4. Marshack properly criticizes past explanations of Paleolithic engravings, which have suffered from naive analo- gy and excess imagination, but at times, under cover of "microscopic analysis," I worry that he goes beyond the data himself. It seems that practi- cally nothing is random, and very little is decorative, yet some "sets," dis- tinguished by tool tracks, were differ- entiated only by microscope. Once past the fact of notation and into the more difficult realm of meaning, there is a fine line between what has been objectively determined and what has been sensibly but intuitively assumed. Lacking Marshack's familiarity with the artifacts; I am unsure that the Cueto de la Mina baton shows four plants clearly differentiated as to spe- cies and growth stage, a crossed-out male ibex, and a female or young ibex. Examining superb photographs pub- lished previously (Marshack 1970c: Fig. 15a), I am not even certain they are ibex, and much less am I con- vinced that the hunting tally hy- pothesis has been eliminated by one in which "the images represent storied explanations and myths summing their associated marks." After analysis of the darts and animals engraved at Polesini, Marshack (1970d:270) earlier and more satisfactorily concluded, "These facts neither confirm nor dis- prove the concept of hunting magic. They do, however, make alternative interpretations possible." Similarly, Marshack seems to have lost some of his balanced objectivity when he flatly asserts that a stone from Parpall6 (Fig. llc, b) can be neither decorative nor a gaming piece. How can he be sure that the visual differ- ences at Parpall6 are due to different materials and techniques, with cogni- tive elements holding constant, rather than different purposes calling for dif- ferent materials and workmanship? Is it so certain that Aurignacian composi- tions were done "over periods extend- ing into months," and that the more sharply cut engraving oTi one face of a Parpall6 stone (Fig. 11 a, b) "represents the work of a different period than that on the second face"? Finally, Mar- shack proposes that Aurignacian pres- sure-flakers were available for long- term use as "slates," whereas in the experience of knappers bone flakers are short-lived. by ELIZABETH ANN MORRIS* Fort Collins, Colo., U.S.A. 14 I 72 This is a clearly presented account of precisely made observations on a body of material that is relatively ubiquitous in its occurrence in Upper Paleolithic sites. The artistic aspects of individual specimens have probably never been so intensively studied by any single scientist, regardless of the hypothesis being tested. The conclusion that incisions and punctations on artifacts composed of various materials and classified into numerous functional categories are systems of notation representing se- quential accumulations of tabulated events seems quite believable. As to what types of events are being tabulat- ed, Marshack favors certain traditional hypothetical explanations. While his suggestion of lunar observational no- tation is intriguing, the selection of one particular interpretation over others can only be viewed as arbitrary, in some cases, and as an interesting possibility, in others, on the basis of the supporting evidence provided. The extensive geographic area and considerable time span involved would seem to permit variable interpreta- tions of at least some of these marks, even if they did represent intermittent sequential notation. The suggested ex- tension into the Mesolithic period would further increase the possible functional variability. The concept of a system of notation accumulated sequentially is described as being less developed among "isolat- ed, peripheral, and static hunting- gathering peoples" than it apparently was among the Upper Paleolithic peo- ple in Europe. A comparison of the Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING larger cultural inventories of the speci- fied "peripheral" tribes and the Upper Paleolithic groups would indicate at first glance that in Europe there is cave art and stone-tool technology to sup- port the author's position that these early European cultures may have played "a central, comparatively dy- namic, formative, and revolutionary role in relation to later cultural devel- opments." If some of the associated cultural background for the data pre- sented had been supplied, the inter- pretive hypothesis would have been more comprehensively portrayed. Other interpretations of Paleolithic art, particularly engravings, might have added perspective to the discus- sion. Some notable contributions are missing from the list of references cited (for instance, Movius and Judson 1956). The discussion of the function of various parts of the human brain in the production of speech and in mathematical reasoning is beyond my evaluative ability. It would seem that to whatever extent Homo sapiens of Upper Paleolithic times needs to be proven "modern," Marshack's re- search helps to do so. I agree with him when he states (p. 460), "To the extent that these notations are 'time- factored,' that is, accumulated sequen- tially over an extended period, they imply a periodic, repetitive, or recur- rent cultural activity.... [and indi- cate] a level of evolved, storied, periodic human interrelation and communication." by HALLAM L. MOVIUS, JR.* Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A. 30 xii 71 Inasmuch as Marshack has omitted all refevence to the very elaborate and well-conceived methodology which he has developed in connection with his analysis of Upper Palaeolithic en- graved bone, antler, and stone ar- tifacts from various sites in Europe, I feel that a summary statement cover- ing this serious omission should be appended to the text. Having been closely associated with Marshack throughout the entire program, I think it appropriate to insert here what in essence is a short introduction to the very important contribution published herein. Already during the early 1960's, Marshack had become convinced that the very elaborate and sophisticated calendric systems of Egypt and Mesopotamia were rooted in a far older tradition. Accordingly, he began a study of Upper Palaeolithic engravings, and by 1964 he had devel- oped a new analytical method of Vol. 13. No. 3-4 . June-October 1972 467</page><page sequence="24">studying the materials in question which by 1968 resulted in the dis- covery and documentation of an evolved and increasingly complex sys- tem of notation. This system had been in use from the early Aurignacian and Pcrigordian intervals of time through- out the ensuing phases of the Upper Palaeolithic (ca. 34,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and it even persisted into the Meso- lithic. In essence, by employing a de- tailed microscopic analysis of the en- graved sequences, many of which were simply regarded as marques de chasse (hunting tallies) by the early workers, he succeeded in conclusively establish- ing the presence of a true system of notation in all the stratigraphic levels investigated to date. Mathematical, statistical, graphic, and se(uential analysis of the results of these micro- scopic studies has indicated, with a high degree of probability, that many of the notational sequences were in fact actual lunar counts. Engraved Upper Palaeolithic mate- rials from sites in France, Spain, Italy, Czechoslovakia, and Poland were sub- jected to an extremely detailed anal- ysis by various cross-referencing pro- cedures. Both the techniques, which were continuously strictly controlled, and the findings are new. The results may be judged on their own merits: they have thrown revolutionary new light on the intellectual level attained by our Upper Palaeolithic forebears. And it is of fundamental importance that the standards established by Mar- shack are applicable for use by other workers. In other words, the new methodology and the results achieved to date by its application cannot in any sense be regarded as subjective. On the contrary, the conclusions are based on an objective research approach which can be employed by anyone interested in the prehistory of man, his early hunting-gathering culture, his society, and his intelligence. Basic to the success of these investi- gations was a high-quality binocular zoom microscope of relatively low power (lOx to 60x). With this equip- ment it was possible to perform a detailed ballistic analysis of the mark- ings, and at once it was apparent that there existed an unexpected complex- ity in even the simplest of the composi- tions. Study under magnification clearly revealed that groups of marks in a series had been made additively and se(luentially by different tools, presumably burins. The marks were also differentiated internally by the angle and direction of the stroke, and they were visually separated by space and stroke differences. Indeed, there was incontrovertible microscopic proof that a series of strokes had been accumulated se(luentially over a pe- riod of time, and that the "counts" were indicative of a record of lunar phasing and periodicity. In many in- stances it was possible to reconstruct the sequential order of the incising of a composition from its beginning on a clean surface, and to determine the actual number of pointed tools (bur- ins) employed, the direction of the various strokes, and the build-up of the successive "periods." The method also included microanalysis of the crossing lines and their ballistic differ- ences and the determination of differ- ences in hand wear, or polish, between old incisions and those made later. Decorative compositions made with a limited number of tool changes with- in a restricted interval of time were differentiated by microanalysis from notational compositions made with periodic changes of tool, stroke, and pressure and by an accumulation of groups of "counts," often indicating a build-up covering an interval of sever- al months. In all instances, the nota- tional sequence exhibited a style and a technique that were both distinctive and distinguishable. It was also pos- sible to discern "work marks" made on a cutting surface by the random dis- tribution and mixing of tools and groups of strokes. Marshack's analyses have shown that the notations also involved a nonarith- metical system which differentiated "counts," or notational periods, on a visual basis. Furthermore, a systematic study of the wealth of engraved ob- jects (mobiliary art) excavated during the last century has resulted in the establishment of a developmental se- quence of notational techni(lue from the early levels of the Upper Palae- olithic through the terminal phases of the Magdalenian and even persisting into the Mesolithic. The results dem- onstrate the evolution of increasingly complex notational devices, which provide evidence of true cognitive and even elementary arithmetical ability. Photographic enlargements were employed to document the ballistic impression of each incision, or group of incisions, on each engraved object. This documentation covers the point of impact, the ballistic track, the tailing out of the line, and in certain instances the actual cross-section of individual lines. With these data, together with the work notes, it is intended that further analyses and computations will be continued at a later date. Perhaps just as important as the analysis of any single object, or se- quence, is the demonstration of the existence of a cross-cultural notational tradition, a tradition which was al- ready highly evolved in the early Upper Palaeolithic levels. A further subsidiary result of these new and spectacular studies has been the estab- lishment of the fact that many of the illustrations of Upper Palaeolithic en- graved materials published during the last century are incorrect, certainly in- ade(quate for the purposes of either precise analysis or documentation. Manifestly it is to the everlasting credit of the author of this paper that he has contributed startlingly new and funda- mentally important evidence bearing not only on the evolutionary level of Upper Palaeolithic man's cognitive and intellectual capacity, but also on the level of symbolic development he had already attained during the in- terval of time represented by these early cultures. Indeed, these questions are of a very different order from those with which Palaeolithic archaeol- ogists have been concerned up to now regarding the evolution of language, kinship organization, and technologi- cal ability, for they are concerned with the creation and meaning of integra- tive ability, and they cover the full spectrum of human cognitive and symbolic comprehension. Marshack's analysis of the Upper Palaeolithic notations has indicated (p. 458) that "while they do not yet con- stitute formal writing or formal arith- metic, they are nevertheless cogni- tively related to them and may thus be their cultural precursors." Further- more, on the basis of the research conducted to date, it is apparent that the styles of notational engraving dif- fered not only regionally but also tem- porally during the Upper Palaeolithic range of time. Notwithstanding the fact that they add a new and revolu- tionary dimension to our understand- ing of the life and times of Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers, they wvere, as Marshack clearly states (p. 460), "adjuncts in the structur-ing of the cultural and economic life [of these people] and are therefore [to be re- garded as] a measure of the complex- ity of that life rather than an indication of the conscious core of that complexi- ty." Certainly, if one accepts the usage of notations and symbols during the Upper Palaeolithic as the normal cog- nitive products of the fully evolved, specifically modern human brain, it places these early European cultures (p. 457) "in a central, comparatively dynamic, formative, and revolutionary role in relation to later cultural developments, a role that today's iso- lated, peripheral, and static hunting- gathering peoples cannot be con- sidered to play." This view is of funda- mental importance, and it should be carefully considered by all those who have thought about the problem of 468 C UR RE N T ANT H RO POLO G Y</page><page sequence="25">reconstructing such matters as the so- cial organization of Upper Palaeolithic man on the basis of an analogy with present-day hunting-gathering peo- ples living under environmental con- ditions comparable with those that prevailed in the past. In any case, Marshack has found that the cognitive complexity of the engraved symbol systems of early Upper Palaeolithic man was demonstrably greater than that of any of the iconographic systems of known historical hunter-gatherers ever recorded. by THEODORE PAPADOPOULLOS* Nicosia, Cyprus. 12 i 72 Marshack's paper is very important insofar as it documents the problem of elementary forms of human knowl- edge. It may eventually lead to the conclusion that "elementary," as a qualifying term, is improperly applied to prehistoric thought. We may in fact be in the presence of highly evolved cognitive forms more akin to modern categories of knowledge than to the inaccessible (as yet?) forms of thought worthy of the qualification "primitive." In this connexion, Levy-Bruhl's pre- logicality (Levy-Bruhl 1910) may be- come conceivable, after all, if referred to the formative periods of the human species, preceding by several hundred thousand years the Upper Paleolithic. One feels, however, that the degree of complexity ascribed by Marshack to Upper Paleolithic forms of thought should not be exaggerated. There is a constant danger of overinterpretation when dealing with cognitive forms representing mental processes at the quantitative cumulation level. Given the highly problematical character of the evidence produced, it is a methodological precaution not to found upon it an elaborate theoretical interpretation, but to state, in the first instance, the gnoseological problems to which such evidence may give rise. Marshack does not engage in this, but attempts instead to test the evidence against criteria deriving from the neuropsychological processes of cog- nition, proving, in one instance, that the Upper Paleolithic mind was ex- empt from brain lesions affecting its ability of understanding. Now the gnoseological problem, as Husserl has sufficiently demonstrated, is irrelevant to psychological and physiological cri- teria and should be considered on its own terms. The evidence produced must, therefore, be studied in the light of a number of problems of cognition, some of which are especially relevant to the aspects discussed by Marshack, for instance: 1. The problem of the prehistory of formal logic. The accumulative and classificatory character of the data con- stitutes evidence of formal modes of thought operating in the Upper Paleo- lithic which may be at the origin of the syllogistic forms in a process of im- memorial evolution leading up to Aristotelian formal logic (Papadopoul- los 1961). 2. The utilitarian use of the data (the term "utilitarian" applying whether the engravings serve practical needs or express magical practices) confers upon them the advantage of a pragmatic connexion, of which e- volved logic is, by virtue of elaborate abstraction, divested. This offers favourable ground for the study of the empirical foundations of knowledge, particularly of the process of formal- ization of thinking out of empirical data. The problem has already re- ceived extensive philosophical treat- ment (Husserl 1939), but its anthropo- logical presuppositions have not, as a general rule, been taken into account. 3. The (uantitative approach de- noted by the engravings may conceal the key to the problem of the anthro- pological origin of generalization and abstraction. Contrary to animals, man can subsume individual objects and experiences under general concepts, thus avoiding repetitional treatment of recurring events. This Akt der Ideierung (Scheler 1928:62 and Chap. 3) is decisive in raising man to social status, but its origins are lost in anthro- pological prehistory. The great enigma, therefore, of Upper Paleo- lithic engravings is whether they are symbols of individual units serially re- petitive and accumulated, correspond- ing to individual objects, facts, or ex- periences, or symbolic expressions of generalized concepts expressing cat- egories of objects, facts, or expe- riences. No answer seems possible at the present stage of research, yet the material produced is highly intriguing. Marshack's scrutinizing of the evi- dence proves at least that Paleolithic evidence should be made the subject of "source-criticism," a methodological procedure identical in principle with that in use in historical research, yet differing in a substantial respect: the criteria of verification should be socio-anthropological and gnoseologi- cal, involving a high degree of correla- tion of deductions from many sectors of the human sciences. by ARNOLD R. PILLING* Detroit, Mich., U.S.A. 12 I 72 That Marshack is considering varieties of notational systems consisting of sets Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING and subsets seems adequately demon- strated in his present discussion of nine artifacts. That the use of such sets and subsets requires brain develop- ment somewhat comparable to that needed for the use of writing seems plausible. Scholars may argue for dec- ades on the details of one or another of Marshack's interpretations, but these two basic findings seem to have been established ade(uately by his Sherlock Holmes-type observations and reasoning. Yet there are several points where Marshack's propositions leave room for (luery. For- instance, when he says (p. 448) that there are "broad nota- tional patterns and structures main- tained by the culture and therefore known to the engraver," he seems to propose that these "notational pat- terns and structures" reflect some pat- tern of a single culture. Yet he does not in the present article provide evi- dence that allows me to be convinced that any two objects have on them representations of the same notational system. In contrast, Marshack's evi- dence seems only to indicate a distant and generalized similarity between surviving examples of his type of nota- tions. Such uni(ueness seems surpris- ing in light of what we know of other, more modern notational systems. One possible explanation for this apparent uni(lueness might be in terms of a specific variety of elitist- produced notation system. The kind of system I have in mind is different from the elitist year-count once made by a few Plains Indians, the message sticks or decorated churinga of the Australian Aboriginal "old men," or the "medicine boards," with their formulas for mixing herbs, formerly known among certain Prairie Indian groups; for in these systems there is no evidence of the use of one and then another tool to suggest that the nota- tions were made intermittently over a period of time. Informants on north- western California Indian esoteric cul- ture state that those rare Yurok who had participated in a vision (luest kept tucked away in caches-often in crev- ices in caves-their personal bundles of mementos. To such bundles were added from time to time items which reminded their owners of especially important events (either "real" or occurring in visions). Could it be that some part of Marshack's notations are tallies of events to be remem- bered? For instance, perhaps Figures 1 through 4 show attempts to use repre- sentations of animal tracks as symbols for events concerning specific species. Could it be that Marshack's examples Vol. 13 No. 3-4 June-October 1972 469</page><page sequence="26">have such wide variation because they represent the half-dreamt, highly in- dividualistic notation systems of "med- icine men"? Possibly we should ponder the likelihood that these notations are to be understood in esoteric contexts. If my speculation is correct, it adds a new series of questions about human evolution. To what extent are those developments which many of us think of as generally present throughout the culture really highly restricted in their earlier occurrences to a very few cave- using, esoterically oriented persons? Are we, as a product of our times, proposing far too egalitarian a course for evolution? Possibly we should at- tempt to use more elitist-oriented formulations as vehicles for testing concepts about some of the later stages of Paleolithic evolution. by SLAVOMIL VENCL* Prague, Czechoslovakia. 15 xii 71 The more evolved ornamentation of some prehistoric objects (e.g., the Sarka phase of linear pottery or stroked pottery in Middle Europe) is just as intentional, cumulative, and se(luential as that of the Lartet and other plaques, but not therefore nota- tional. On stroke-ornamented vessels, also, modifications as to the form of strokes and their grouping in the course of a line can be traced. How- ever, this feature does not prove that the ornamentation was accumulated over a rather long period of time: on the contrary, it is clear that it was executed at a single moment. The varying shape of the strokes is obvi- ously due to the altering position of the hand holding the engraving tool or to the changing position of the object being decorated. In spite of the author's very thorough microanalysis, I can hardly consider the problem of the significance of elements such as denticulate edges, incisions, and strokes on Upper Paleolithic plaques as solved. Some symbolic significance may be admitted; however, in my opinion, a safe decision as to whether ornamentation or symbols are in- volved (and, even more so, as to the ultimate significance of such symbols) is beyond the limits of the evidence archaeological remains can offer. Reply by ALEXANDER MARSHACK The comments are sufficiently broad and adequately evaluative and critical of details to have begun constructive discussion of a new body of concepts, data, and methodologies. I take it to be the beginning of a long, continuing interchange. Since the comments, like the re- search, touch on different problems, each a subdiscipline of the study, I shall discuss them separately, in hope that future discussions will maintain these distinctions. I have developed a new methodology for analysis of the engraved mobiliary materials of the European Upper Paleolithic; this has provided a huge corpus of data, in effect turning the library of known symbolic artifacts into new materials, peripherally indicating that the rendi- tions originally published are inade- (luate for analytic or interpretive pur- poses; the burgeoning data have made it possible to begin new interpreta- tions, necessarily tentative and the- oretical in the first years of the re- search, on cognitive aspects of the art, symbol, and culture of the period. No such interpretations were essayed be- fore, because there were no ade(quate data. The purpose of the paper was to discuss the cognitive aspects of one class of data, the notations. It was my thought that enough documentation was already in print, in press, or in preparation to clarify the methodolo- gy, its development and potentialities. A number of replies suggest there was need for further methodological dis- cussion, and this will be appended at the end. Hallam's response, describing the complexities of Australian Aboriginal time-and-space cognition in their eco- nomic, ritual, and symbolic life, is pro- foundly to the point. That she made the leap from the limited discussion of the notations to the detailed macro- world of a contemporary hunting- gathering culture is most helpful. My book (Marshack 1972a) has as its pri- mary documentation and conclusion just this formulation, but derived from the spectrum of the European Upper Paleolithic materials, and it would be possible to drop Hallam's response into my volume verbatim. The vol- ume's basic conclusion, to paraphrase Hallam, is that we have early Homo sapiens evidence for a "symbolic struc- turing in the ecological and cer- emonial interaction of landed groups and peopled landscape." I assume this to have been one of the essential mani- fests of these early cultures with rele- vance for a discussion of the evolution of the hominid cognitive capacity and culture. To paraphrase again, with some changes: in the Upper Pale- olithic "space structuring was ecologi- cal-functional; temporal structuring viewed seasons in terms of human exploitative and symbolic activity, and exploitative and ceremonial activity were as articulated as the vocabulary which reflected them. Vocabulary, in- cluding a precise classificatory termi- nology, and seasonal economic and territorial behavior reflected spatially, temporally, and functionally ordered cognitive patterns derived from and imposed on phenomena, and were in- tegrally linked to complex (ritual, mythic, and artistic) patterning where- by that cognitive lore was maintained and transmitted." Notations were an aspect of this interrelation. These con- cepts in turn have relevance for Papadopoullos's discussion of the phe- nomenological basis of knowledge and for Farmer's on ethnosemantics. Upper Paleolithic images and com- positions indicate a precise observation of species characteristics, including sexual, seasonal, and maturational dif- ferences: stallion, mare, yearling; male and female seal; male salmon in the season of spawning; leaping salmon in the spawning run; doe, stag, fawn; stag in the velvet stage of antlers; stag and bison bull in the rutting stage; the seasonal moulting of bison and musk ox; differences in bird species and between chicks, young birds, and adults; the seasonal characteristics of diverse plant species, including seed- ling, flower, leafing and leafless branch; and finally the seasonal con- temporaneity and interrelation of spe- cies and stages of flora and fauna. These features are so precisely rendered that one must assume that the images represented not generic plants, birds, fish, or animals, but cog- nitively, linguistically, and culturally differentiated species, characteristics, processes, and interrelations. Signifi- cantly, these differences occur also in compositions depicting rite and sacri- fice. Just as one assumes a certain level of linguistic complexity and abstrac- tion to maintain a tradition of nota- tion, one assumes that the classifi- catory and narrative (or mythic) lin- guistic structures necessary to main- tain the semantics of this body of imagery put us again into the realm of modern usage. But here we note an apparent dif- ference in "complexity" between the Australian and European symbolic 470 C UR RE N T ANT H R O PO LOG Y</page><page sequence="27">data. While Australian image is rich in generalized and stylized animals of different species, in abstract signs and forms, and in mythological creatures, it does not symbolically differentiate flora and fauna as did the Upper Pa- leolithic cultures. This does not mean that the Australian does not observe, utilize, name, and narrate these pro- cesses and differences. But when such phenomenological1 and classificatory specificities are objectified in image and composition and are also in- corporated into myth and cer- emony-rather than being the generic mythic snake, kangaroo, lizard, or dreamtime hero-then we have sym- bolization at a slightly "higher" level. The cognitive e(quations and strategies and the contents of the mythic equa- tions tend also to be of a different order. A system of time-factored, phe- nomenologically related symbols and myths offers a potential for long-term development, comparison, abstrac- tion, diffusion, dispersal, and accretion which is not only reality-related, but in some degrees neither parochial nor idiosyncratic. By the nature of the reality references and equations it is a somewhat open system, more adap- tive, more able to incorporate ecologi- cal changes, discoveries, and diffused elements than closed, regional mythi- cal systems. Referring to Hallam's comment, then, I was not writing of (luantitative, structural, or psychological "complexi- ty" in the Upper Paleolithic use of symbol but rather of the contents that are functionally cognitive. With this formulation we are again brought to the responses of Papadopoullos and Farmer. It perhaps clarifies my use of the word "static," obviously incorrect as a descriptive term, but apt as a comparative. Similar differences exist between the "sequential" accumulations of the Eu- ropean Upper Paleolithic and the renewals and notations found in Aus- tralia. It is my understanding that Ab- original message sticks and composi- tions can serve mnemonic functions which are (quantitative and spatial without being arithmetic or numeric in a formal sense: a series of named unit water holes are depicted as circles and may symbolize "sleeps," "camps," or "days" in a wandering as well as a terrain; or sets of unit marks may indicate the number of persons of varying sex being asked to attend a corroboree. Such systems, while nota- tional and abstractive and related to Upper Paleolithic marking (since they are indicative of the same cognitive capacity and evidence a time-space re- lationl to the land and to other groups), are not cumulative, nor are they in- tended to serve culturally as devices for long-term structuring. In this paper I have discussed se- quential sets of unit marks accumulat- ed over a period of time. These were the first findings of the microscopic methodology. With development and extension of the methodology it was found that the Upper Paleolithic sym- bolic accumulations were quite diverse and complex. A number of publica- tions have already dealt with non- notational accumulations and composi- tions (Marshack 1970c, d, 1972a). There were accumulations of images which included flora and fauna in a seasonal or a ceremonial context, at times associated with signs or symbols or notations. There was evidence that such "art" compositions were occasion- ally accumulated over a considerable period. There was another class, ac- cumulations of female figures, which had become a form of calligraphic sign and which operated in its own seman- tic context. There were isolated animal images which served as long-term symbols to be renewed and reused by the addition of later abstracted parts of the animal, or by the addition of sets of darts or notations. Analysis of the images and tableaus in the painted caves, recently begun, has revealed notational and symbolic accumulations of a different semantic content. Ani- mal images on the cave walls represent a more limited repertoire, but were renewed and reused as on the mobili- ary materials. The general complexity, then, of such image and symbol usage compares with that of the Australian Aborigines. But there is a cultural dif- ference. In Australia symbolic artifacts and wall images are also retained, re- newed, and reused by repainting, re- telling, resinging, or rehandling. But these procedures apparently entail a full recapitulation of the ceremonial, linguistic structure or artistic render- ing (Moore 1971). What is immediate- ly apparent in Upper Paleolithic use of image is the traditional tendency toward abstraction of the symbolic ele- ments as they accumulate. The sign will sometimes end as representative of the entire accumulation or complex. This is not a matter of the historical development of a style of representa- tion but of a short-term manner of abstractive thinking. An added ear, eye, leg, mane, belly, or back would reconstitute a horse image and the maker's participation. A series of real- istic darts might accumulate with in- creasing abstraction until the last marks or darts were single unit strokes. imazisticallv meaningless to an Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING outsider. A series of realistic fish might accumulate towards a decorative fish motif. This suggests that it was not necessarily the precise image or form which was of relevance in certain con- texts. There was, instead, usage of a transformational, abstractive process, culturally and individually under- stood. Certain evolved signs or forms do finally and historically seem to attain a widespread cross-cultural dis- persal in the European Upper Paleo- lithic, and they are often phenomeno- logically related (vulva, female but- tocks form, water). In Australia, ab- straction of the process-related image was apparently not as fundamental as the elaboration of the "static" mythic image. Finally, the ubiquitous European tradition of keeping and manufactur- ing mobiliary surfaces to accommo- date accumulations of different classes of image and symbol is, I think, unique. Again, I am not discussing a quantitative difference in intellectual or cognitive capacity or cultural com- plexity but the functional, transforma- tional, and abstractive contents and processes within the symbolizing tradi- tion. The above comparisons may have some significance for the development of agriculture. Hallam notes that the lack of plant cultivation among the Aborigines does not preclude their understanding and use of periodic processes and phenomena in time and space. However, such lore is admitted- ly not manifest artifactually and sym- bolically. The fact that such processes and phenomena are depicted among the Upper Paleolithic artif actual mate- rials, and are related to ritual and ceremonial, suggests that the semantic and adaptive contents of these images, symbols, and rites may have differed substantially from those in use among the Aborigines. There is the implica- tion of a profound theoretical (luestion here, in part concerning the definition of "knowledge" and its varied possible phenomenological relations. Effective agriculture requires rather complex sequential strategies and equations as well as linguistic and mythic structures adequate to formu- late and maintain them. These func- tional strategies are involved with flora and fauna and time-space relations within a limited ecological domain. To what extent were the interrelated time-factored symbol systems of the European Upper Paleolithic poten- tially capable of being adaptive, that is, of being utilized during the severely changing conditions of the post- Wuirm? The data at this stage suggest Vol. 13- No. 3-4- June-October 1972 471</page><page sequence="28">that aspects of the phenomenologically related strategy and equation systems were retained and apparently did serve adaptively among the scattered ecologies of the Mesolithic. In reverse, might a closed, parochial, idiosyncratic symbol system such as is found in Australia hinder such developments or adaptive shifts? The failure of cer- tain primitive hunting-gathering groups, in contact with agricultural or herding peoples, to adopt these econo- mies might in some degree be ex- plained by the semantic contents of their cultures, by the specialized, paro- chial cognitive equations and strategies supported by their language and myths. To what extent were the phenome- nologically oriented strategies, equa- tions, and symbol structures of the Upper Paleolithic retained and dis- persed to form the potential bases for the eventual development of indige- nous agricultures? Some of the clues are apparently present in the Upper Paleolithic notations and images, in the Mesolithic symbolic materials (Marshack 1972a), and in the cognitive artifactual materials of prehistoric Asia and America under study. Might the question of why various agricultures evolved "suddenly" in a limited period of a few thousand years, out of apparent Upper Paleo- lithic roots, be related to the question of why art and symbol developed "suddenly" in the Upper Paleolithic? Were both aspects of a developing cognitive and cultural complexity? We are brought again to the problem of the contents, meaning, and nature of human knowledge. Here Farmer's suggestion that the cognitive contents in hominid tool- making are an aspect of the general- ized hominid capacity for thinking in time and space is germane, as is his suggestion that this capacity had rele- vance for the development of lan- guage and man's broad adaptive be- havior. It is a conclusion I had reached from study of the Upper Paleolithic symbolic materials (Marshack 1972a). I extend his suggestions to note that in the Upper Paleolithic we have (a) a sculpture which is allied to tool- making in the sense that the three- dimensional image is "in mind" before it is shaped, but different in that the shape is essentially of symbolic and not practical utility and (b) the manufac- ture of specialized tools for the carving of the nonutilitarian image, a huge leap in cognitive complexity. Further, surfaces were prepared for linear images and notation, and specialized gravers and burins were made and utilized. Lithic manufacture for subse- (luent symbolic manufacture is, in large part, neglected in studies of lithic assemblages, and this neglect has been one of their limitations. The leap in cognitive complexity involved in the manufacture of syrmbol and image can be theoretically derived from the evo- lution of a generalized cognitive ca- pacity for time-and-space conceptual- ization and abstraction, with tool- making and language as aspects of that, development. Image- and symbol- making cannot be derived from tool- making as a manipulative skill. It is the specialized use of this generalized ca- pacity, then, that is apparent in the Upper Paleolithic notations, in the strategies of the Australian Aborig- ines, and in the navigational skills of the Caroline Islanders as described by Gladwin (1964, 1970) and noted by Farmer. Navigation by the Micronesians presents another facet of the problem. The required skill in time-and-space conceptualization and sequential func- tioning entails a knowledge of periodic and phenomenological processes and geometries of quite different orders: lunar phases; stellar orientations and pathways, nightly and seasonal; wind and wave velocities, directions, and patterns; determination of distances in terms of elapsed time, velocity, and star orientation; and tacking and sail- ing skills. This navigation is a classic example of preliterate or nonliterate specialization of the cognitive capacity. Nevertheless, despite the complexity and phenomenological orientation, it is a closed, idiosyncratic system. It is closed in many ways: because it is the secret skill of a subgroup (elitist, in Pilling's sense), but also because the skills, equations, and phenomena are parts of a regional, parochial matrix. The whole is problem-specific, and the cognitive system is not supported by linguistic, symbolic, or mythic formu- lations or equations that would make the lore applicable in other domains. Gladwin (1970:204) notes: ". . . no- where does the navigation system de- mand ... innovation.... There is no occasion to seek new techniques or strategies or to (luestion the system as it stands." In this sense of self- enclosure, this skill, like Australian or Eskimo ecological skills, is concrete, phenomenologically oriented, but 'static." We are brought again to the nature of "knowledge" and of cognitive strat- egies and equations as they might be abstracted, symbolized, and mytholo- ized to function as e(uations of rele- vance or of transformation applicable to other realms. Apparently, in the Upper Paleolithic, symbolic equations and concrete thinking of a different order and potential were in develop- ment and flux. The Australian Abo- rigines and Caroline Islanders have knowledge of lunar phases and stellar periodicities. But the waxing and wan- ing of the moon and the yearly season- al return of the stars, while recog- nized, utilized, and mythologized, do not function symbolically as equations of relevant process and periodicity in such a way as to be applicable else- where. This does not mean that other periodicities are unrecognized, but rather that the complex integration of "adaptive" equations which I presume to have been necessary for agriculture has not taken place, at least in terms of the moon and stars. As noted above, Upper Paleolithic notational and other symbol systems (Marshack 1972a) sug- gest a recognition of the interrelation among phenomenological periodici- ties (flora, fauna, sky, menstruation, birth), and these were symbolically and ceremonially cohered. Like a general- ized system of notation, these other symbol systems could be used in many contexts, practical and mythic. Papadopoullos's response is relevant here, since it is to the implied semantic or gnoseological contents of Upper Paleolithic cognition, as well as to an elaboration of his perception that the word "elementary" cannot be properly applied, that one part of my paper is directed. Unfortunately, in the discus- sion of aphasia he has inferred that I argued that Upper Paleolithic man was exempt from brain lesions. I did not. Apart from this, his observations lend an important dimension to the discussion. While the data indicate a cumulative and classificatory character, they do not evidence formal modes of thought comparable to or necessarily leading to later-evolved syllogistic forms. Every notation is by definition the abstracted symbolization of some other semantic system. But the notation might be mnemonic and the primary meaning narrative and, in a philosophical or syllogistic sense, "nonlogical," though the two systems, the linguistic and the notational, might be (luantitative, cumulative, sequential or serial, addi- tive, and abstractive. In Hallam's ex- ample of the Australian lunar "count," eight phases or points in the lunar month are named in sequence. These represent two larger periods of "wax- ing" (five names) and "waning" (three names): first crescent, first (uarter, half (our "quarter"), second quarter (the three-quarter image), and full moon; then three-quarter, half, last (luarter. The Australian names are nonnumerical, thnere iS no indigenous number system that would encompass this sequence, and the naming se- iuence is therefore a nonnumerical 472 C UR R ENT ANT H RO POLO G Y</page><page sequence="29">form of seriation and quantification. If these eight units were marked off as notation, we, as modern outsiders, would have a numerical 5 + 3 = 8 analysis, and this 8 would conceptually e(lual one "moon" or month. Yet clear- ly, though observation, sequencing, (luantification, abstraction, and nota- tion would be involved, there is neither formal logic nor formal arith- metization in any part or in the final product (see discussion of the Blan- chard sequence). In fact the entire rational sequence could be maintained and explained in a mythic telling of the moon's birth and death. In this sense a notation sequence may "cor- respond to individual objects, facts, and experiences" and represent "gen- eralized concepts." Such theoretical, early, interrelated symbol systems, once formalized into traditions of no- tation, image, and periodic usage, could potentially lead to arithmetiza- tion, formal syllogism, Aristotelian logic, and finally the structures of science. But the process is not linear or simple. It should be noted, also, that the degree of psychological, semantic, and cultural complexity in such early systems must not be underestimated. The question concerning the foun- dation of "knowledge" by the abstrac- tion and formalization of pragmatic, utilitarian, or empirical data is per- tinent, but philosophical. Discussion of the problem by Husserl epitomizes its basic psychological, cultural, and onto- genetic limitations. Husserlian phe- nomenonology seeks the meaning of "knowledge" as an abstracted univer- sal, in some ways comparable to Chomsky's "universal grammar" for language, though the first is created by the species and the second is apparent- ly biologically within the species. Phe- nomenological psychology as pro- jected by Husserl, in like manner, seeks the "essence" of mind. Such heuristic models serve to objectify cog- nitively perceived processes as "en- tities," but they are really not much different in this respect than the hy- pothesized myth-making above. That they "work" is no more an indication of their validity than is the "working" of myths of the moon. Such models are themselves products of the evolved H. sapiens brain and of its capacity to symbolize. They are more examples of that capacity than explanations or de- scriptions of it. The idea of a utilitarian pragmatism related to the foundations of knowl- edge is also heuristic, just valid enough to be helpful. As suggested earlier, the evolved capacity for concept forma- tion is to a degree generalized; it is a capacity that functions equally in prag- matic and symbolic effort. Is the myth- ological tale that linguistically formal- izes the concept or equation of a trans- formation, that is, of a change of char- acter, form, or relation, a form of "knowledge," though all the elements, characters, and events in it are false and the transformation it narrates im- possible? From a utilitarian, pragmat- ic, and adaptive view, such completely false tales may help a man or a culture to recognize and deal with a spectrum of complex phenomenological trans- formations and processes. Does it have "knowledge" content if it is nonsyllo- gistic, nonfactual, totally mythic, with absolutely no objectively valid internal reality references? Structural or trans- formational analysis of such a myth might never find any deep structures of pragmatic, utilitarian content. Its "essence" may be a recognition of the inexplicable possibility of transforma- tion and change, an elementary insight of human knowledge. Again, tool-making requires a lore concerning the different sources and qualities of materials, processes of manufacture, and final uses, none of which may be possible of full linguistic or syllogistic formulation, yet which involve complex perceptions, solu- tions, strategies, and sequences. The problem is an old one, but it has not been discussed in an evolutionary, de- velopmental, and species context. Piaget has indicated that the capac- ity for concept formation matures in a child through recognizable stages. Can one speak of the "knowledge" possible or belonging to a stage of maturation before there is such "knowledge"? If so, should part of a definition of "knowledge" contain the potential lim- itation at each stage, and therefore also the potential limitation for "knowledge" of the species? If the H. erectus cognitive capacity, ca. 400,000 B.P., is assumed to be mid- way towards that of modern man with- in the evolving hominid sequence, was the phenomenologically oriented cog- nitive lore of the culture "knowledge," "half knowledge," "preknowledge," or an "elementary" hominid form of knowing approaching the possibility of knowledge? Would the communica- tions that were necessary at that level be "half universal grammar"? The questions are obviously meaningless. I assume instead that the capacity for complex spatio-temporal abstractions and relations evolved and that H. erec- tus cultural products, including tool- making and communications, repre- sented aspects near the potential limits of that capacity. If this is so, we can assume that this form of species- specific cognition is more evolved in Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING H. sapiens and that today's cultural products represent the evolved, gen- eralized, potential capacity. It is in this respect that I have assumed the early notations to be products of a modern capacity and a "historical" cultural complexity. Within such a theoretical framework one can perhaps begin to hypothesize the significance of cognitive develop- ments among hominid forms and to study the artif actual, cultural products comparatively and phylogenetically. The archaeological materials of H. sapiens are later products for such study and comparison. Always in these discussions one is brought back to the evolved level of processes in the brain. I have been informed by Geschwind that despite many important basic findings, aphasiac studies are still ten- tative, that work in the field is sparse, and that Luria's work, while innovative and classic, postulates structures and processes that are at times too simple. The frontal lobes, supposedly crucial for planning, can be removed by lo- botomy without altering the estab- lished plans or routine functions of living. However, the affective, motiva- tional inputs to plans and planning will slowly deteriorate. This adds to cogni- tion the problem of affective inputs in the structuring and use of conceptual systems and poses questions con- cerned with the evolution and adap- tive role of this component. Gesch- wind also notes that the cognitive, lin- guistic, and symbolizing processes of the brain are not unitary. They are diversely specialized seqluences; and motor, language, and music, for in- stance, represent separate modes. How such modes function to create "knowledge" as a product is still un- sure. He also suggests the evolution of a specialized hominid visual memory, entailing processing at each stage of perception, coding, and use. It is clear, then, that every area of study and subdiscipline in this basic in(quiry into human cognition and the bases of knowledge is still early. This includes my studies of the Upper Paleolithic symbol systems. Movius has recognized that this paper re(luires methodological discus- sion. As an overview, his response places the research in developmental perspective. Since the fieldwork of 1964-65, whose first unexpected re- sults were presented in a description of the early research within a chosen limited sampling of six examples (Marshack 1971b), subsequent work has immeasurably deepened the bases of analysis and comparison as well as the nature of the data achieved. In- Vol. 13- No. 3-4 June-October 1972 473</page><page sequence="30">dividual artifacts have been reex- amined over the years, always produc- ing new data. It was at the last moment that late results were interpolated into the 1971 b work, which was written in 1966-67, in order to supply the micro- scopic evidence for utilitarian use of the plaques from Lartet and Blanch- ard, the evidence of reshaping of plaque A 212, and the marking of a nonutilitarian scrap. Recent research has provided even more important evidence for the complexity of the notational tradition. A bone fragment from La Marche was revealed in the third examination to have been a tool that was used as a surface for notation, image, and cer- emonial participation. The bone was accidentially broken, severing the original notation and image, and then reshaped as a pressure-flaker. The remnant free surface was then en- graved with new sets of notation, a new image, and new evidence of re- peated "ceremonial" use and par- ticipation. The complex seqluence of events, microscopically determined, eliminates the possibility of decorative intent or "art." The accumulation of a body of- such comparative evidence is separate from the intensive analysis of the sets themselves. The late research has also indicated the presence of more than one tradi- tion of "notation," as suggested by Pilling. In the caves recent analysis of sets of unit marks indicates that they were often made with different ochres at different times but that they are not of the same order as those on the engraved mobiliary materials. They represent a separate semantic system of unit marking. But there are also other forms of cumulative or repeti- tive symbol marking; some have been published, others are in preparation. Among these, the sequences of sets on the mobiliary materials form a special- ized, differentiated group. Despite temporal and regional differences in appearance and style, the basic cogni- tive and sequential contents and pro- cedures place them together. Anati indirectly raises a methodo- logical question when he discusses the uncertainties of a lunar interpretation and the particular inadequacies of Frolov's work in this area. My own first paper (Marshack 1964) suggested the presence of notation with lunar proba- bility based on an examination of the published materials. At that time Frolov reported that my simple arith- metic method was interesting and sug- gestive (Frolov 1965), and he indicated that he had begun to seek and find comparable arithmetic evidence based on the presence of the number seven. It was precisely because I did not trust such simple visual analyses and arith- metic attempts that intensive internal microscopic analysis of the materials was undertaken. Frolov, in his latest paper (1971), is still counting visually and finding the number seven. It has been my experience that this visual method does not, except in a gross sense, give reliable analytic data. Anati is right in his discussion of magnifica- tion, but in the bone industry of the Upper Paleolithic it is possible to se- cure important data at higher magnifi- cation on engraved bird bone or rib material. One must work at lower magnifications with coarse, granular stones. Fry's assumption that the "heavy hand of [a] big-game hunter" could not engrave such minute sequences is ethnocentric. The extraordinary detail in the small engraved images, includ- ing the hairs in the ear of a lion, the whiskers on the chin of a doe, and the almost invisible realistic feathered and painted darts engraved into animals (Marshack 1970d, 1972 a), destroys the myth of the "heavy hand." In minute engraving where the total length of a sequence of engraved marks may not exceed a few centimeters, the amount of modification of the point is slight. To date the microscope has always revealed that each set begins and ends with no cross-sectional change and that the final stroke in any set tails out like the others without evidence of breakage. A completely new point be- gins the next set. There are also times when the same point will be used for more than one row or subset, and the analytic set then contains these as sub- sets. Fry's lack of confidence in micros- copy should be answered by the many papers and publications now in print and by Fradkin's indicated success in this direction. The suggestion by Clegg and White of possible tool-testing is important because there is a class of marked bone where random marking and over- crossing by different points does indi- cate either work or testing. But the small scale of the marks in the nota- tional sets and the generally shallow marking preclude any functional test- ing; besides, the sequences and com- positions are too structured and com- plex. The suggestion concerning primates fascinates me. I did see a chimpanzee in the Madrid zoo with an iron nail that he used to engrave a series of parallel lines into the plaster of the wall outside his cage. But that was all. The capacity to mark with a tool was there, but the capacity to "signify" the marks, privately or culturally, was absent. The marking was not part of an accumulation of sets, and it was nontraditional. What evolutionary changes were necessary in the brain to make the primate manipulative capac- ity "hominid," adaptive, and cultural is the question that has been raised in this discussion. Vencl's remark about "obvious" changes in the grip holding the en- graving tool cannot explain why cross-sections change, sometimes three or four times, within a linear sequence of marks that extends only a few cen- timeters. Neither the plaque nor the tool would have to be shifted three or four times for so close a marking. The actual complexity of marking is qjuite great and can only by accounted for by intentionality (Marshack 1971 b, 1972a). Lynch suggests that the notational tradition begins in the Aurignacian. Actually it is "abundant" documenta- tion that begins in this period, and its presence may be due in part to the large industry in worked bone and stone among these cultures. Absence of engraved notations in the earlier period indicates lack of evidence, not an absence of notation. In the histori- cal period in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas, tallying and rec- ord-keeping were often on perishable materials; wood, skin, cords. Such ma- terials would leave no artifactual traces. Analysis of historical notational and mnemonic systems has been be- gun, and some of the first results are in print (Marshack 1972a). Their com- plexity is not in question, but the Upper Paleolithic use of interrelated symbol systems and of phenomeno- logically related image was far more sophisticated than those found among historic preliterate peoples. There are, as earlier stated, noncalendric nota- tions, engraved and painted, in the Upper Paleolithic, and the cognitive contents of these will be presented separately. The most detailed of the methodo- logical queries are by Brose. They are formulated, unfortunately, in the con- text of traditional ideas concerning Upper Paleolithic "art" and symbol. The most important hindrance in the last century to the development of an analytic methodology for study of this vast body of materials has been the ethnocentrism of the modern inter- preter. Brose's remark that these marks are "both artistic and decorative in every sense except the most ethno- centric" represents just this traditional ethnocentrism, stated categorically, apparently because the compositions "look like" decoration in the one- dimensional illustration. More to the point are the analytic problems raised. As mentioned ear- lier, there are many classes of mark- 474 C UR RE N T ANT H RO POLO G Y</page><page sequence="31">ing. Leroi-Gourhan (1965) has pub- lished a catalogue of such forms for the caves. A similar complexity exists on the mobiliary materials. The fact that no two compositions of painted dots on any cave wall are the same does not indicate that they are random or that they do not constitute sets. The finding that different ochres were used is comparable to the cross-sectional data on the engraved materials. In addition, in the caves closely adjacent ochred sets show vast differences in deterioration as sets, indicating both a difference in time and a possible dif- ference in the binding material of dif- ferent mixes. The data are again com- parable to engraved accumulations where closely adjacent sets on the same plane show differential wear or polish. Marking in sets is documented, then, as a cultural tradition. One can- not term the painted sets in the caves tool-testing, decoration, gaming pieces or scores, or hunting tallies. They are simply too difficult to reach to be the latter. Brose questions linear se(luenc- ing, (quantification, and the presence of internal relation among the sets. The microscope evidence is in print (Marshack 1971b, 1972a). Brose men- tions "cognitively unrelated represen- tations" as on the La Colombiere peb- ble. Microscopy has documented complex intentional relations among the different species engraved in a single composition (Marshack 1972a), though not in Leroi-Gourhan's terms of sexual bipolarity. Brose suggests a "square cognitive element" instead of a "point of turning" in the Blanchard se(Iuence. The microscope indicated a square cognitive element made of four marks necessarily engraved in se- quence, with a series leading to it and one from it. That it might have been conceived as a "square" in a modern sense is unlikely, since no marking of that form, as imaged by dots, appears anywhere in the Upper Paleolithic. Apparently Brose is treating such marks and sequences as though they were random, discrete artifacts such as -tools or broken pots found on a habi- tation floor, for which patterns of rele- vance and relation must be sought in the scatter. The notational marks are not randomly scattered, but intention- ally engraved, and the analytic prob- lem is one of attempting to find the possible relevance or patterning within the limited, finite sequence of en- graved sets. A set is not a tool or pot, and intentional se(quencing is not like a tool scatter or assemblage. It rep- resents marking in a tradition which is itself a factor in the analysis. Sequences of sets are, even when no arithmetic, (1uantified, cognitive sums. It should be noted that even from a traditionalist point of view the cogni- tive and cultural factors that would be involved in gaming scores, hunting tallies, decorative patterns, or mne- monic marking have never been dis- cussed in terms of their possible signif- icance for the early Upper Paleolithic cultures. Like the concepts of hunting magic and increase magic, such for- mulations have tended to close discus- sion rather than lead to analysis. Exceedingly long straight-line se- quences with complex internal changes of point are documented (e.g., at Le Placard [Marshack 1972a]). The problem of possible alternate readings for nonlinear accumulations of microscopically determined sets is easily solved since the possible choices are limited. On the Lartet piece the sequence of engraving-lines first, dots second and right to left-is again a determination in part confirmed by the cognitive procedures of the Upper Paleolithic notational tradition. It is usual for a sequence to begin with a large free use of space and, as the notation accumulates on a limited sur- face, to show squeezing of the sets and Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC ENGRAVING diminution of the marks. Sometimes, towards the end, the maker overen- graved an already existing set or went off to a side, out of the pattern. This kind of marking is not found on the organized, decorative pieces. It is, however, found in recent, historic ca- lendric notations (e.g., in Nicobar [Marshack 1972a]). Brose declares that there is a lack of "good evidence" for the use of marine or estuarine resources in the Spanish Solutrean, citing a 1925 reference. In the recently discovered cave of Nerja, near Malaga, numbers of red painted fish of the Solutrean period have been discovered (Reyna 1965). Reyna's re- port concludes (p. 33) that these "men of the coast were mostly dependent [on fish], for they were probably more fishermen than hunters...." Brose refers to the so-called tec- tiforms as possible "structures." Again, this is a nonanalytic classification of a complex body of forms and images. I have identified true images of struc- tures, found many of the so-called tectiforms to be notations, and identi- fied some as "signs" or patterns not related either to notations or struc- tures (Marshack 1972a). That one finds archaeological evidence of habi- tation structures does not mean that all images of "geometricized" forms are habitation structures. Lindner (1950) has termed them hunting traps. True images of structures are com- pletely different in form and style from the sequential notations (Mar- shack 1972a:320). Anati, Morris, Fry, Brose, and Papa- dopoullos variously request more doc- umentation than could be reasonably supplied in the present paper. It is my hope that continued publication of the data, and the ensuing discussions, will serve to explicate the cognitive prob- lem, not only in terms of the symbolic materials but in terms of man as a species.
