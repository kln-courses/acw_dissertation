<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXIV, No. 24. NOVEMBER 24, 1927 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY PERSONAL AGENCY AND THE HUMIAN ANALYSIS THE recent revival and spirited defense of the doctrine of inter- action in many able quarters have focussed attention once more upon what is the real kernel of the problem. Few now in this sur- prising age will venture to say that the interaction of mind and body is inconceivable. The old demur on the score of the Law of the Conservation of Energy has lost much of its force, partly be- cause of its dubious assumptions and partly because of various prom- ising loopholes of escape. The superfluity of consciousness in bodily control, once thought to be confirmed by the seeming facts of "un- conscious cerebration" and the wonders of the reflex, is still as far as ever from being proved. These issu are by no means dead, but they seem to us now, as we look back, somewhat casuistical. We are at the real heart of the matter, however, when we revive the question: What is meant by mind acting on body (or vice versa) ? And what positive grounds have we for affirming a real causal re- lation between these terms? Interactionists, of course, have con- stantly referred us to the crucial cases of volition and sensory stimu- lation as prima-facie evidence of psychophysical causation. But they have seldom had the courage of their convictions in proclaiming this to be more than observed uniformity of succession. It is sur- prising to find, for example, one prominent interactionist appealing to Hume as having once for all blasted the notion of "power" or "necessary connection" and yet championing interaction as a dis- tinctive doetrine that implies, in opposition to parallelism, some real power of mind over body. For, once we accept Hume's criti- cism as valid and resign ourselves to "customary conjunction"' or "uniiformity of succession," what ground have we for objecting to parallelism as a less plausible interpretation of the facts? If that is all we know and all we need to know of causation, then it seems idle as to whether we read the psychophysical sequences down the series with the parallelist or across the series with the interactionist. It was with a keen sense of strategy that Hume saw the crucial importance of voluntary action and launched the full force of his attack upon what he conceived to be the false implications of this universal experience. For the common-sense philosopher has always taken his stand upon the invincible testimony of consciousness that 645</page><page sequence="2">646 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY here in the command of our will over our bodily movements we have the sign and seal or prototype of all true causation. Who shall, say how much of the traditional cosmological argument has not rested, implicitly if not explicitly, upon this intuitive basis? Nor can we scorn this as mere naive anthropomorphism when we recall how many modern philosophers of foremost rank from Descartes to Bergson have been in substantial sympathy with this position. Since Hume, how- ever, it has hung its head and only now and then have serious sus- picions arisen that Hume's classical argument might go the way of Berkeley's. The latter seems to be the candid opinion of so acute a thinker as Dr. C. D. Broad, who finds the great skeptic's case against interaction to be partly " silly " and partly " irrelevant. " I On the other hand, Hume finds a spirited defender in Professor Hoernl6, who feels that Hume's analysis, while not fatal to a modest, em- pirical theory of interaction, is still in the main relevant and con- clusive.2 The purpose of this paper is not to enter into this con- troversy, but rather to inquire what answer we are able to make to-day to the very grave difficulties which Hume raised. At the outset Hume admits, as do we all, the plain, everyday fact of voluntary control-the fact, namely, that "the motion of our body follows the command of our will" and that "of this we are at every moment conscious." 8 But of the real power or creative energy which accomplishes this, we, alas, know nothing. How fa- miliar those soft, deadly cadences of the Hlumian logicI At the risk of abstraction, let us confine ourselves mainly to the argument concerning mind and body. 1. First, there is the unsurpassed mysteriousness of the union of soul with body. This does not intrigue us today in the same way; for we incline towards a more empirical approach. We do not start in Cartesian fashion with two alien substances, spiritual and material, which once having been logically put asunder can not be joined together. We take our stand rather upon the immediately experienced unity of mind and body and search in vain for the line of separation. What nature hath joined together, let not philos- ophers artificially put asunder. When I will to gesticulate and my arm executes the motion, is there any frontier or point of transition between the mental image and the bodily movement? If so, intro- spection can not discover it. The mystery, then, is not to find some interspanng connection between a separate cause and a separate effect, but to ascertain whether the evident continuity of mind and 1 The Mind and i,ts Place in Nature, pp. 101-103. 2 4 I Broad and Hume on Causation and Volition, " this Jouv.NAw, Vol. XXIV (1927), pp. 29-36. $Enquiry concerning Human Under-standing, Open Court Ed., p. 66.</page><page sequence="3">PERSONAL AGENCY AND THE HUMIAN ANALYSIS 647 body is a mere determinate flow or whether it deepens somehow into causal necessity. Between passive flux and active effort there is, for common sense at least, a whole universe of difference. The opposition between pleasantness and unpleasantness, or between black and white, does not seem so great or so profound as the felt antith- esis of active and passive. Shall we not, as James suggested, take this experience at its metaphysical face value? If the traditional two-substance theory were all that Hume was attacking at this point, why did he press home a sheerly empirical difficulty? His repugnance to thinking that "the most refined thought is able to actuate the grossest matter" betrays a psycho- logical rather than a logical prejudice. It is more akin to that Victorian shrug of incredulity: "How shall the idea of a beefsteak bind two molecules together? " In this day of radio and other once- incredible marvels of science, we hesitate to dictate to nature in so arrogant a fashion. There is also a fallacy of observation in the objection. Except in the secondary automatism of habit, some dy- namic content such as the intention or feeling of endeavor is in- variably present. Pure thought seems never to actuate the mus- culature except through the psycho-physical medium of effort; and effort, it is significant to note, is by introspective testimony a com- mon factor in both mental and bodily activity. Another of Hume 's challenges in this argument seems high-handed and unreasonable. If we are to know this power of th:e will, why must we first know "the secret union of soul and body and the nature of both these substances?" If power lies in the mysterious limbo of the unconscious or amid psycho-cerebral machinery under the threshold, then surely we know it not. But what if it should lie on the surface in open awareness as it so strongly seems to do? There is a curious all-or-none principle that lurks behind the whole of Hume's critique and betrays a certain intolerance. He seems to say: either we know the whole story of the mind-body relation or we know nothing of it. Such a position were truly suicidal. If in such despair at the outset, we need argue no further. But does knowledge not rather start from small beginnings and grow from more to more? If we had first to know everything of a given mat- ter, how could we ever know anything? 2. Next, there is the argument against "power" and "necessary connection" on the ground of the severe limitations of the will's authority. "Why has the will an influence over tongue and -fingers and not over the heart and liver?" Were we "fully acquainted with the power or force by which it operates, we should also know why its influence reaches precisely to such boundaries and no fur-</page><page sequence="4">648 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ther. "'4 Who should possess such remarkable knowledge? The ordinary run of mankind or only the psychologist? The psycholo- gist, of course, now confidently tells us that the economy of the or- ganism demands such a hierarchy of function. Just as the general who should attempt to carry in his head all the detailed duties of his army of privates would suffer a brainstorm, so conscious control would be utterly swamped by the terrific burden of regulating all the thousands of vital and reflex functions. As a matter of fact, in both cases the lower level details are entrusted to a descending scale of subordinates. Moreover, the autonomic nervous system which regulates the heart and the liver is insulated from cortical control by high synaptic resistances and only in emotional crisis or under hypnosis is conscious control extended beyond its normal lim- its. In the case of the man "suddenly struck with palsy," we have simply a pathological restriction of voluntary control such as is caused by lesions in the motor areas of the cortex. Why, then, the illusion of power when there is none? Surely because there is kines- thesis in the adjacent, unparalyzed muscles, supplemented by re- vived memory images of the lost motor movements. As a matter of fact, the paralytic still exercises a measure of control: (a) over his intention and (b) over adjacent, unparalyzed muscles. Con- sciousness deceives in a measure as usual, but its deceptiveness can be explained and allowed for, as in the case of any other illusion. But perhaps Hume would welcome such an explanation as clinch- ing his main point, namely, that experience alone teaches us the what and how of the will's power. If we really knew this alleged power of the mind over the body, we should know a prtonr and without the psychologist, what act of will would move what muscle and which one would not. But is not this, after all, a rather ex- traordinary assumption? Do we find any capacity of mind or body, whether cognitive, affective, or motor, to be perfected at the outset? Or unlimited in scope? Conviction is growing that truth, like other values, can not be judged by the crude and experimental be- ginnings of its discovery, but rather by its ripened, full-formed fruit- age. Knowledge of the power of volition, like the power to per- ceive external objects, because constantly developing and undergoing refinement, need not be either unlimited or infallible to be actual and veridical within its limits. Hume says to us in effect: either we are conscious of the power of mind over body prior to and inde- pendent of experience or else it is only an artifact, an artificial con- struction from repeated experience. This dilemma is unconvincing; for there is at least a third possibility, namely, that we perceive thig power or necessity, not before or after experience, but as all volun- 4'Hume, Zoo. cit., p. 67.</page><page sequence="5">PERSONAL AGENCY AND THE HUMIAN ANALYSIS 649 tarists have believed, within the living heart of experience. Against Hume's ipse dixit that "experience only teaches us how one event constantly follows another," we have the equally solemn affirmation of his opponents that they discover more than this, namely, a neces- sitation or real causing of the bodily act by the will. Is this an il- lusiont Whose introspective testimony shall we accept: that of sceptical sophistication or the fresh, realistic simplicity of common sense? 3. Hume's third objection is more serious for the advocate of causal interaction. "The immediate object of power in voluntary motion is not the member itself which is moved, but certain muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits . . . through which the motion is suc- cessfully propagated, ere it reach the member itself whose motion is the immediate object of volition." 5 Ardent parallelists like Pro- fessor Strong have been wont to consider this argument unanswer- able, since it impales the interactionist on the horns of a dilemma.6 Does the volition aet upon the brain or directly upon the bodily member whose action is called forth? If the interactionist says the former, then the causal relation which he claims to perceive is an indirect and hence only an apparent one. If he says the latter, then what is the use of the brain with its motor areas and the de- scending motor tracts? The interactionist has never, I think, suf- ficiently exercised himself to meet this dilemma. For the most part, he has simply reiterated the universally attested uniformities of voluntary action. Now Pillsbury and other cautious scientists have assured us, after reviewing the experimental evidence, that the con- nection between the volition and the corresponding motor-act con- forms to all the logical canons of causation.7 But time and time again in the history of science, apparent uniformities have been displaced by deeper-lying uniformities. Consequently, the interac- tionist's claim to have established a true case of causation between mind and body remains precarious as long as the causal sequence in question is suspected of being an indirect one. It is by no means clear that Hume spoke the last word on this matter. We certainly do not learn from anatomy, or from psy- chology either, that the volition, if it acts at all, acts on the member in question only through a chain of intermediate causes, namely, the cerebro-motor series. This is no finding of empirical science; 5 Hume, Zo. cit., p. 68. 6 0. A. Strong, Why the Mind Has a Body. 7 Titchener Coiamemoratitve Volurme, Studies in Psychology, 1917, pp. 21-22. Cf. also, H. S.

The testimony of im- mediate experience is that the mental process known as the intention flows directly and uninterruptedly into the arm movement. In fact, the two events are so intimately interfused that they seem but two phases of one continuous process; and it is only when the volition is frustrated or inhibited that we can isolate the one from the other. The interactionist, therefore, may boldly ask: "How do we know that there are any intermediate events between volition and motor response?" There are none, he may go on to affirm. The evidence is, at best, indirect and far from crucial. Sever the motor nerve be- tween the cortex and the muscle and the volition fails to take effect. What does this prove? Simply that uninterrupted connection be- tween brain and muscle is a necessary condition of effective volition; not that a series of neural events must intervene. What, then, is the function of the neuro-muscular mechanism on the efferent side? The interactionist may reply, developing his hypothesis, that it is to execute the movement in detail. The function of the conscious process, on the other hand, is not to act as a deus ex machina or om- niscient wire-puller, but to initiate and in a broad way to orient the energy-flow. According to this view, the conscious self is no mystic telegraph operator at the brain terminals, darkly fraternizing with the myriad synapses of that super-switchboard. It rather per- vades the organism with its own telic energy in much the same way as a magnetic field of force is thought to permeate the armature of an electric motor, but perhaps in an even more intimate manner." There is no good reason, in fact, why the doctrine of interaction should be fatally tied up with an artificial dualism of external re- lations or with the Cartesian myth of a de-materialized ghost lodged in a soulless automaton. Such an entangling alliance has too long held it in disrepute. If this more monistic view of interaction should be found tenable, in contradistinction to identity theories at the other extreme, it would go far to meet the causal difficulty. For it construes the volition as related to the bodily act, not in a mysteriously external, "transeunt" relation, but exactly as intro- spection reveals, namely, as successive phases of a continuous se- quence of "i nmanent" causation. Causality, as Mr. Alexander suggests, is at bottom continuity.9 But, in its psychogenic aspect at least, it is more. For it is no mere passing flux or flight of eva, nescent instants, but a continuity deepened into the quality of pro- pulsion. Let us surnose. on the other hand. that our friend. the interac- 8 The extrovasory effects in hypnosis (e.g., blister formation) are strikingly suggestive here. 9 S. Alexander, Space, Time an4 Deity, Vol. I, p. 281.</page><page sequence="7">PERSONAL AGENCY AND THE HUMIAN ANALYSIS 651 tionist, adopts the view that the self or volition acts causally upon the brain. Is he not then forced to confess that the causal relation is not immediately perceived, but is partly shrouded in mystery and hence a hazardous inference at best? This being the case, how can he be sure that the parallelist's version is not the truer one? To be sure, the interactionist can challenge the parallelist to justify his denial of psychophysical eausality, while yet affirming the reality of interphysical or inter-mental causality-a challenge which, I feel sure, the parallelist has never met. Indeed, to suppose that, in the case of the conscious organism, nature's chains of causation become so exclusive as to move only on parallel tracks like railway trains abreast, is to suppose so glaring an anomaly in the whole realm of natural causes as to be incredible. Do we not find everywhere else a glorious democracy of intercausation I But this long obvious weak- ness of parallelism does not really advance the cause of interaction. It is such a seeming impasse that has led many philosophers to de- clare that the issue between these two historic theories is either in- soluble or irrelevant.10 The interactionist, however, has one interesting resource left. He may take his stand upon the significant analogy between causal realism and perceptual realism. If physiological intervention is fatal in the one case, is it not so in the other? Or if it does not de- stroy certainty in the second case, why should it in the first? The thorough-going realist is so sure of the real presence of the perceptual object before him that he is ready either to deny that the sensori- cerebral mechanism of perception intervenes between the knower and the object or to affirm boldly that such intervention is no ob- stacle to veridical knowledge. One may classify realists, in fact, into two groups, according as they proceed logically and dialectically from the immediate presence of the object in perception or proceed psychophysically from the objectified "vision'" conditioned by the brain. It has been the seven days' wonder of philosophy as to when and where these two ends of the tunnel are to meet. Some believe that they have now met. All parties agree, however, that the instrumentality of sensory stimulation (e.g., from eye to brain) is no ground for denying the reality of perception, but simply a con- dition of its detailed effectiveness. Why, then, should that of ce- rebro-motor innervation not bear the same relation to the causal unity of mind and body in volition? The analogy receives added strength when we recall: (1) that the "instinctive" belief in the objective reality of things about us is derived, not from the vivid- ness of sensation, but from our voluntary effort against the resistance 10 Cf. B. Russell, Mysticism and Logic, "The Notion of Cause."</page><page sequence="8">652 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of these same objects;"' and (2) that our belief in the power of our minds over our bodies develops in early experience parn passu with our conviction of the external reality of physical things. Con- versely, when the mind loses its sense of power, as in certain patho- logical states, the outer world becomes shadowy and unreal,.even though sensory acuity is unimpaired.12 -It is, therefore, difficult to escape the conviction that the perception of force, power, or energy -which is always an experience of volition in some measure-can not be separated from the perception of size, shape, and the other primary characters of external reality; that its veridity stands or falls with that of the latter; and that in the active-passive reciprocity of normal effective volition through our bodies force meets force as really and as truly as mind envisages nature in perception. 4. Another classical objection is one which Hume raised in one of his fertile footnotes, namely, that "we attribute power to a vast number of objects, where we never can suppose this resistance or exertion of force to take place.'8 Notable cases are the Supreme Being, "the mind in its command over its ideas and limbs" and in- animate matter. But (1) why should we suppose that the Supreme Being never meets with any resistance? To the modern mind this is a very dubious inference from the postulate of omnipotence. (2) It is simply not true that in the second case "the effect follows im- mediately upon the will without any exertion or summoning up of force." Such is the case only in habitual action and in certain automatisms; normal volition is attended by the sense of effort in however varying a degree. (3) Finally-and this is the most se- rious difficulty-how can we suppose inanimate matter to be capable of a sentiment of endeavor? Thus, if I am pushing at a boulder and conscious of my own power against its resistance, I can not sup- pose the stone or its component atoms to experience a similar and opposing feeling of effort. To the panpsychist, this challenge is welcome, for he boldly draws the very conclusion which Hume shuns, to wit, that physical nature is not dead and inert, but living, active, striving. Following Leib- niz, he even appeals to our experience of force as one of our chief bases for this view of nature. It is not, of course, the physical ob- ject as a whole that feels and strives, but rather the psychic atoms or monads of which it is composed. This dramatic theory of reality has had a strange fascination for many able minds; and who, after all, can deny that it may be true? It remains an interesting but, as yet, unverifiable speculation founded upon an imperfect analogy. 11 W. McDougall, Outline of Psychology, p. 372. 12 Ibid., p. 372. 18 Op. cit., p. 69.</page><page sequence="9">PERSONAL AGENCY AND THE HUMIAN ANALYSIS 653 Just here, however, is raised the crucial question as to how much objectivity we can ascribe to our experience of force. When I per- ceive this fountain-pen, for example, the size, shape, and even the color seem to be there in the pen and not in my mind, but my con- scious act of perceiving, which I can introspectively distinguish- th-at is not in the pen. Why, then, should the boulder which opposes my effort possess, not only the quality of force, but something similar to my consciousness of endeavor as well? The opposite view, namely, that our kinesthetic sensations have no objective validity while our visual sensations have, is, as Professor Montague has pointed out, quite indefensible.1' There remains a middle ground. Force may be something objectively given in perception, but distinguishable from our subjective sense of effort or striving. What is this something ? Is it merely a decorative quality which inheres in physical objects like color, perhaps? Or is it a peculiar relationship characterized by something like necessity? Both these views have been held, but, taken separately, they miss out a vital and essential aspect. If force is simply a quality inherent in the object, then its connection with its effect is purely external and arbitrary. On the other hand, if it is a pure relationship, a mere bond of connection between qualities or events, then, as Hume pointed out, we seek it in vain through the whole realm of nature. The most promising alternative seems to be to regard it as a relational quality or. qualitative relation. It certainly possesses quality or our kines- thetic experience is sheer illusion. But it is also perceived as some- thing which binds the parts of our experience together, which makes one event follow another or the same event continue. Now this quali- tative relation is primarily given in our experience of voluntary effort. Is force, then, to be identified with real causality and, in especial, with the power of the mind over the body? This is the voluntaristic hypothesis, and the strongest ground for it is that the body is our intermediary in the experience of reciprocal effort and resistance and that in kinesthesis mind and body interfuse-a unity which is not incompatible with a remaining duality of content and function. At this point, however, Hume shoots his favorite arrow. "This sentiment of an endeavor to overcome resistance has no known con- nection with any event: What follows it we know by experience; but could not know it a prori.' 15 If by causality we can only mean a deductive principle by which the details of experience can be magicallv deduced a vrtwr. then. indeed. Hume is unanswerable 14 Consciousness a Form of Energy," Essaays in Honor of Willam James. Also, "Variation, Heredity and Consciousness," Proc. Arist. Soo., 1920-21. 15 Op. cit., p. 69, footnote.</page><page sequence="10">654 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY and, we may add, scientific investigation superfluous But if caus- ality be a principle of internal connection, empirically discovered in the dynamic flux of immediate experience and then inferable beyond the personal flux with the same degree of certainty as other empirical characters, then the difficulty is robbed of much of its force. The truly radical empiricist can say: here, at least, when I will, is real causality at work; and wherever experimental analysis exhibits true causal sequence, I may reasonably infer this pervading ":necessity" to be present also. May it not be that Hu'me, in de- molishing the fearful bogey of an overarching rationalistic necessity, overlooked this modest, empirical necessity and so fell back on the unsatisfying phantom of customary conjunction? 5. Hume's final thunderbolt is hurled against the alleged power of the mind. over itself. Here it is no longer a question of inter- action, but one main point deserves notice: Hume shifts his ground and concentrates his murderous fire upon the notion of "creation out of nothing" as the supposed essence of power. Such "creative power" by which the mind "raises from nothing a new idea" is "not felt, nor known, nor even conceivable by the mind.""16 Hume seems to present us with a dilemma, one of whose horns is a self- contradictory proposition. Either we are conscious of the power of our minds to produce ideas out of nothing; or else volition and idea are inscrutably conjoined with no intelligible bond of connec- tion. In the first case, we are asked to explain the ex h ypothesi in- explicable-not how the mind produces an idea (something similar to itself) out of itself, but how it produces an idea, an alien some- thing, out of nothing! We are challenged to conceive of a triadic causal relation between three terms, one of which is non-existent. One is reminded of the old conundrum about the irresistible force meeting the immovable obstacle. But suppose we admit the incon- ceivability (to us) of this kind of causation and drop out the non- existent term, "nothing," are we driven back to the other horn of the dilemma? Is the relationship between volition and idea utterly incomprehensible? Surely not. As in the case of bodily control, the two are not discrete events externally related, but successive phases of one continuous and unitary process. Here again, in the ever fleeting duration of the "specious present," we live through the dynamie connection of will and idea and feel as irresistibly that we are controlling in a measure the course and sequence of our thinking. But, it may be rejoined, do not our ideas come to us, leap forth out of the void as it were? Yes, but such receptivity is. usually the fruition of previous effortful thinking. So far as thought is purely creative and absolute novelties emerge, we may 16 Op. cit., pp. 70, 71.</page><page sequence="11">PERSONAL AGENCY AND THE HUMIAN ANALYSIS 655 well share Hume's humility. At such moments, the mind is simply passive, not active. Even to genius nature seems to say: Be humbly creative (by persistent effort) and I will make you greatly creative (by inspiration). To affirm that the will may be causally active in generating thought is not to deny that the mind's control over itself is strictly limited, extremely variable, and profoundly dependent upon experi- ence. Begotten of desire, cradled in association, nurtured by in- cessant stimuli, may it not nevertheless emerge into true autonomy? At least, we should not be stampeded into scepticism by an arbitrary, hard-and-fast logic with all-or-none categories or by outworn phobias for a priori magic. If, moreover, we replace a structuralistic-atomis- tic, by a functionalistic-organic, theory of causation and creativity, we shall remove, perhaps, the greatest stumbling-block to the restora- tion of this dethroned category. To sum up--Hume's formidable critique of the volitional theory of causation may be written down unproved until the following basic assumptions and questionable principles receive better support: (1) That causes and effects are disjoined, being separate and dis- tinct elements of experience. (2) That in the case of mind and body, we must either know the complete nature of the cause and effect and of their connection or we can not know it at all. (3) That this connection must either be intelligible to us before the first ex- perience of the effect or not at all; for the pseudo-intelligibility that comes from repeated experience is an opaque and artificial associa- tion of otherwise unrelated data. (4) That necessary connection must be an external relation joining, but separate from, the terms connected. (5) That power (of the mind over its ideas) means creation out of nothing; or else it is a mere subjective and illusory confidence based upon repeated experience. I am unable to find any real ground for assenting to these propositions. We have, then, it seems to me, only Hume's affidavit as to his personal introspections in the matter. As against this, dynamism or causal voluntarism is the view that in volition we achieve our truest and most fundamental knowledge of causation. This commonly discredited view becomes greatly strengthened if we can show: (1) That in volition cause and effect are not distinct elements, but distinguishable phases of one contin- -uous process. (2) That the brain and its issuant motor excitations probably do not intervene between the volition and bodily act, but rather underly and effectuate the detailed execution of the act. (3) That the relation of volition and bodily movement, as subject to psychological investigation, satisfies all the logical criteria such as agreement, difference and concomitant variations. (4) That kines-</page><page sequence="12">656 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY thesis and visual perception are so intimately related and their abstraction so indefensible that we can not be visual realists without affirming also the objective reality of force. (5) That force, since invariably perceived as related to our voluntary effort, is best re- garded as a qualitative relation, rather than as a simple quality or pure relation. (6) That the antithesis between activity and pas- sivity (resistance) is one of the most vivid and meaningful in our whole experience and there is no good reason for denying its im- plicit truth-claim. (7) That external resistance is perceived as opposing force, but not necessarily personified. As in perception, the purely subjective factors can be eliminated or shown to be ir- relevant, leaving this essential core of objective force or causality. The panpsychic conclusion thus need not be drawn; or, if drawn, requires some better ground of inference. (8) Since the human body is the medium of interaction between the mind and the outer world, being a common term in a triadic relation, we may regard the perceived power of mind over body as a primary causal rela- tion of the same order as external causality under the aspect of force. Conjointly, kinesthesis may well be that which mind and body have in common, the locus, so to speak, of their union. (9) This causal relation is no a priori principle of overarching necessity, but an empirical, conditional necessity. When we will and execute a movement, we judge as irresistibly as in drawing a logical con- clusion that the effect is no mere happening, but, here at least, must occur. Can we, then, postulate universal causation? Perhaps the best thing we can say is that, when allowance is made for illusions and counter-causes, causal realism, like perceptual realism, is an in- ternally and externally consistent, fruitful, and on the whole ex- tremely good, hypothesis. In his less fanatical and more confident moods, Hume seems, in fact, to have agreed. In conclusion, to say that mental events like volitions are the causes of bodily movements is to assert: (1) scientifically, that the first are experimental determiners of the second in such a way as to satisfy all the causal criteria: and (2) metaphysically, that uni- formity of sequence is the sign of something deeper or more funda- mental, namely, an internal, qualitative relation which is perceived to pervade the indivisible continuity of mind-body in volition and which is characterized by a certain necessity of the this-must, rather than of the all-must type. Such necessity, however, far from being "merely subjective," is as truly objective as a valid inference or a true perception. If this view be rational and in accord with the facts, then those philosophers are right who say that in willing our bodies to move we know in very truth that which umkes things happen.
