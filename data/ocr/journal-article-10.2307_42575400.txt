<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter L. Haratonik« INFORMATION/ PROPAGANDA: Analects from, a Technological Society 1. I.B. M. (it is no longer "International Business Machines") is not in the machine business. I.B.M. is in the information business. In a post-industrial society (see Daniel Bell), "The business of business is information." 2. Information, according to Shannon/ Weaver, is not to be con- fused with meaning or knowledge. Information is just the "stuff'; a measure of uncertainty or choice. (Note "choice" of language by Shannon/ Weaver et. al., circa 1948.) 3. Jacques Ellul. Propaganda. "Propaganda becomes possible only when people develop a consciousness of general problems and specific responses to them. The formation of such responses is precisely what the promulgation of information creates ... in- formation prepares the group for propaganda." 4. Information is clearly not a question of getting "it," rather of what to do with "it." A former N.A.S.A. programmer once told me that large quantities of computer readout from satellite monitoring stations are simply shredded since no one could ever find the time to analyze it. Question: Does the very nature of in- formation (meaning) have to change in the face of information (quantity of uncertainty)? * Peter L. Haratonik is Director of Media Studies at the New School for Social Research. He informs us that analects are, literally, "crumbs that fall from the table." 153</page><page sequence="2">154 Etcetera • SUMMER 1979 5. Information is quantitative in a technological society; a doctor can honestly inform you that an operation provides a 50% chance of survival, which is of no informational value, if you are the one out of two who becomes 100% dead. (From Anatol Rapoport) 6. Medical anecdote: "Ohio State University reports on medical research which failed to find any significant differences between people who survive a heart attack and those who die from one. " (The New Yorker - Oct. 16, 1978) Please inform as to definition of "significant differences." 7. Propaganda, following Jacques Ellul, is a sociological phenomenon integral to technology and technique. It is a process whose purpose (note anthropomorphic tendency) is to make us adjust to existing patterns - as opposed to political or agitation approaches. 8. Computers, it is said, only process data and are not yet (underline yet) capable of artificial intelligence. What does this mean? Presumably that humans are in control. Yet what does in control mean if / no longer understand the process of decision-making yet have been convinced to accept the pattern? A story: Computer specialists from a consortium of countries deter- mined to solve an "unsolvable" dilemma merge all existing data banks into one source of data and ask the ultimate question: Is there an omnipotent God? The computer responds, "There is now!" 9. In my bank (note the use of the personal pronoun) the com- puterized, automatic "teller" flashes "oops!" on the video screen if I push the wrong buttons. Last week it (?) shortchanged me $20 and did not acknowledge this oversight on the screen. I had no "oops" button and was thus relegated to dealing with a "person" (person: noun, singular; servo-mechanism which is used as part of computer complaint system) who informed me (with a smile) that "we" had to wait until the machine was through its cycle. If $20 was left, then I was right. If not, one can only assume it took itself out to lunch on my account. Moral: never trust a computer programmed to flash "oops." 10. Computer: noun, singular; an electronic, digital calculating system which structures the patterns of behavior of the persons whom it was designed to serve. 11. Computers lead to mathematical results, which seems to bear some relationship to the fact that we have available to us endless mathematical results; endless information, but what meaning?</page><page sequence="3">Information/ Propaganda 1 55 Let s say it's 1924 and we undertake a survey to see how many Germans (operationally defined for the purposes of the study) were affected by propaganda of one Adolf Hitler. Let's say the result is one. O.K., hardly significant, unless that one was Josef Goebbels (see Ellul's Propaganda, pp. 275-76). 1 2 . This is a real study: The present research varied threats to attitudinal freedom and initial receiver attitude at four discrepancy intervals from the position ad- vocated in a persuasive communication: extreme agreement; moderate agreement; moderate disagreement; and extreme disagree- ment. Results indicated that receivers in moderate disagreement and extreme agreement shifted toward the recommended position, with no difference as a function of message threat level. In contrast, significant attitude change away from the position advocated in a threatening message occurred among receivers in moderate agreement and extreme disagreement. The significance of these results for the im- portance of the freedom to agree or disagree with a persuasive com- munication is discussed. Human Communication Research vol. 4 no. 4 Subjects: 143 undergrads in introductory communication courses (83 males, 60 female). (Note: at least two studies in the last four issues of this journal utilize as subjects college undergrads enrolled in introductory speech or communication classes.) Results: We now know more about the communication of undergraduates enrolled in introductory speech and com- munication classes than we know about all other segments of the population combined! 13. If information yields propaganda, does propagation yield in- foganda? 14. We hear a lot from "informed sources" these days - anchor per- sons quite often relate how "informed sources" (usually followed by "close to so and so") report such and such. What is an in- formed source? (What is an uninformed source?) The best I can do: it is someone who is designated to release information to the public via a media intermediary (media intermediary?), in order to make it appear that the information did not come directly from the source. This situation seems to assume that it is not within protocol for, let's say, Cyrus Vance to say "I think the SALT Talks are moving along" - no sir! But it is perfectly safe to say "informed sources report . . . so that the unnamed aforementioned source can always deny the report. Certainly is informative, isn't it?</page><page sequence="4">156 Etcetera • SUMMER 1979 15. In spite of the amount of information available, in general we get (and want) less of it (to keep us sane?). A tailor once told me, "Don't worry, from bigger we can make smaller!" How do we deal with smaller to begin with? 16. Information equals management. Without sound information processing, the myriad details about millions of individuals can- not be handled. What did we do in the Dark Ages B.I. (Before Information)? We had good old reliable propaganda to create, control, and determine. We certainly have come a long way. 17. Propaganda is not very fashionable these days. Like wide ties and polyester suits, it would never be admitted to any of the fashionable discos in N.Y. Information - well! Information has Nobel Prize Laureates working for it, and Xerox, and who knows who else, and looks very chic in trimmed-down clothes with trimmed-down hair - very neat, urbane, socially acceptable from Portofino to Peking, from Kuwait to Katmandu, from Monaco to Moscow. No more shaggy, raggy, radical propaganda - only tailored, teasing, total information, so chic the film version could be called "I.T.T. meets Idi Amin." 18. Following J. J., then: Is "propaganda that nightmare from which I am trying to awake" or is "information a dream in which I want to stay asleep"? 19. Continue analects - probably not for posterity, but then, in an age of propagation/ infoganda, posterity may be just around the corner.</page></plain_text>
