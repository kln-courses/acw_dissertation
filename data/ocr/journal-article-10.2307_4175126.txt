<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS Harald Weinrich, Phonologische Studien zur romanischen Sprachgeschichte (Forschungen zur rom. Phil., ed. H. Lausberg, vol. 6) Miinster, Aschendorff, I969, 2 ed. Pp. vi +29I, 7 sketch-maps. To all appearances this is an unretouched reprint of Weinrich's I958 thesis, with the addition of a short, and rather eccentric, supplementary bibliography. Weinrich's own interests appear to have strayed of late from historical structuralism, so he has not attempted to reply to earlier critics who eschewed 'explanation' in historical linguistics (like Baldinger, 1958; Togeby, I959-60; Spence, I965) nor to more recent attacks on the methods and assumptions of historical phonemics (e.g. King, I967; I969). It is ironic that just as Politzer (I961; also 1959) was proclaiming the importance of the impact of structuralism on historical studies, 'dynamic structuralist' fireworks were just fizzling out: Martinet's attention has been turned elsewhere, so that only intermittently does he fire a rocket; the Lausberg group (including Ludtke and Weinrich) have had little new to say. The current disenchantment with phonemics has had its effect on historical linguistics as else- where. 'Explanation' of change, except in terms of 'simplification' which spreads by the whim of fashion, is laughed out of court as teleological and anthropomorphic: the idea that (non-existent?) 'autonomous phonemes' should attract or repel neighbouring phonemes is regarded as nothing short of 'quaint'. Where internal linguistic forces are at work they merely have the result of 'simplifying' the rules of the grammar (but isn't that also rather a teleological view?), though this may indeed start off a 'drag-chain' reaction of the sort envisaged by Martinet and Weinrich. Weinrich himself has escaped (why?) the onslaught of generative historians, who have reserved their heaviest guns for Martinet. Yet his own brand of 'dynamic structuralism' is more vulnerable than Martinet's, in that for him avoidance of phonemic merger is the prime (only?) cause of a whole chain of phonological changes that led from the unity of Latin to the diversity of the modern Romance dialects. To escape confusion with the geminates in intervocalic position, single surds phonemicized their 'weakened' intervocalic allophones: this led in turn to loss of the vowel quantity system, with a whole host of side-effects, like diphthongization. If we are allowed to ask the question 'why?', we may seek elucidation of the motives for avoidance of this particular merger, especially as it actually occurs in Rumanian. Weinrich offers none, not only making no mention of 'functional load' (still, I think, a useful concept in spite of King's sneers, which admittedly are hedged about so much as to render them anodyne) but also rejecting such external motivating factors as language contact. The more general accepted text-book view is that an externally motivated change of accent led to substitution of vowel quality distinctions for quantitative ones and hence to simplification of geminates and voicing of intervocalic surds in the west Romance area: the 'whys' of this process are more easily (if not more satisfactorily) explained than those of Weinrich's. His work is disappointing for its underlying assumptions but not for its scholarly documentation: we must be grateful especially for his detailed study of phonological features of the Romagnol dialects. In my view his fault lies not in his use of autonomous phonemes (for in spite of all the song and dance, the difference between Chomskyan and Prague school phonology in the treatment of sound change is mainly terminological) but in his adherence to the neo-grammarian 'blind force' view of 'regular' sound-change. If there is such a thing as an inviolable sound-law we should obviously be curious about what causes it: the 'contradictions-of-the-capital-system' and 'quantity-to-quality-jump' types of explanation then have their attractions. But is 'regular' change substantively different from 'sporadic' change, or has it merely spread further through the language (cf. Posner, i96i)? One of the welcome features of Chomskyan historical linguistics is that it recognizes that the vexed question of 'paradigmatic sound change' may be a faux probleme. Unfor- tunately, at its present stage, it has not yet escaped the trap that caught Weinrich - that of seeking for the single necessary cause and not suspecting that a whole complex of factors, including chance, may be at work (cf. Malkiel, I967). 306</page><page sequence="2">SIIORTER NOTICES REFERENCES Baldinger, K. (I958). Zu Weinrichs phonologischen Studien. ZRPh, 79. 503-566. King, R. D., Jr. (I967).
