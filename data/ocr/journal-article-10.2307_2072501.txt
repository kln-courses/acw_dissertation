BYRON EARHART Western Michigan University Japanese new religions, the most conspicu- ous religious force in contemporary Japan, have been the frequent subjects of works by social scientists and historians of religions-- who usually have treated these new religions from a functionalist viewpoint, as responses to social crisis or a form of deprivation. But the vast majority of these works have been long on theory and short on concrete information to demonstrate the theory. Guthrie's book is a welcome exception, providing a clear theoretical approach to one Japanese new religion and supporting it with ample fieldwork. Guthrie boldly sets aside functionalist definitions of religion that view religion as fantasy, falsehood, irrationality, or emotionalism; rather, he emphasizes a ra- tional or intellectual approach to religion as a model "to interpret and influence the world by drawing analogies among phenomena" (p. 6). Guthrie holds this to be true about religion in general, Japanese new religions in particu- lar, and specifically Rissho Kosei-kai. After an introductory chapter on "problem, theory and method" which elaborates this approach, he applies his theory in the context of an anthropological study of Rissho Kosei-kai within the setting of a mountain village. The second chapter outlines "the hamlet" as preparation for three chapters on religion within the hamlet: established Buddhism, Shinto, and Rissho Kosei-kai. The sixth chapter features life histories of six members of Rissho Kosei-kai within this village, and the seventh chapter draws conclusions. Of the numerous contributions made by this work, the two most significant are the clarity and consistency of the theoretical approach, and the richness and concreteness of the supporting fieldwork. The functionalist approach, which consciously or uncon- sciously has dominated the vast majority of all Western (and most Japanese) treatments of these new religions, has been applied without thorough consideration of the assumptions of the approach or its implications. Guthrie not only questions these assumptions and implica- tions in a convincing manner, but provides a clear picture of a "rationalist" approach to religion as a model of interpreting the word. Those who have read only functionalist treatments of new religions may profit from reading Guthrie's alternative viewpoint. Guthrie's fieldwork traces the career of a new religion in a village, from its beginnings and initial expansion to its subsequent lan- guishing. His fourteen months in the village (from November 1970 and January 1972) enabled him to see all the ambiguities and complexities of the entrance of Rissho Kosei-kai into the lives of the individuals and the hamlet. Functionalist treatments of new religions, painted with the broad brash of social crisis and the pigments of anomie and deprivation, have depicted the people who joined Japanese new religions as little more than robots responding to overwhelming social mechanisms. Guthrie's in-depth descrip- tion does not overlook such elements as changing social structures or forms of depri- vation, but it enables us to see how people in such situations happen to select a new religion such as Rissho Kosei-kai as a model to make sense out of their world. Even within a single village and one branch of a new religion, Guthrie finds amazing diversity in the reasons for joining and the use (and disuse) of this model. Guthrie's book joins a handful of Western-language works that have provided such concrete information on Japanese new</page><page sequence="2">450 REVIEWS religions. He quotes a number of these works, which have been published since he did his fieldwork in 1970-72, but the dissertation on which this book is based appears to have been a pioneer in the study of Japanese new religions in two respects: as the first Western treatment devoted solely to a new religion within a village, and the first extensive use of life histories to ascertain the actual workings of a new religion. Not all readers will accept his "rationalist" approach to religion (for example, his empha- sis on religion as anthropomorphism), but Guthrie has raised important epistemological considerations and has been clear and straight- forward in presenting his approach. The care with which the detailed picture of the village is recorded will make it of interest for all readers concerned with society and religion in recent Japan.
