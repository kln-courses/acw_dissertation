<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION I937 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF OFFICERS American Council of Learned Societies The eighteenth annual meeting of the Council was held at the Hotel Montclair, New York City, on January 29-30, I937. The Association was represented by its delegates, C. J. Ducasse and S. P. Lamprecht. The Secretary represented the Association at the thirteenth annual conference of Secretaries of the Constituent Societies on January 28, and was also present at the meetings of the Council. Throughout its deliberations, the function of the Council as a planning and coordinating agency rather than, as in the past, an operating organization for special projects, was empha- sized. Professor Ducasse reported on the progress and needs of the Bibliog- raphy of Philosophy. It was voted that the good offices of the Council be made available to the Association in seeking funds for the completion and publication of this Bibliography. The constitution of a Committee on the History of Ideas, with A. 0. Lovejoy as chairman, was announced. R. W. Sellars was elected a member of the Council's Advisory Board. At its April meeting the Executive Committee of the Council voted to make available to the Association the sum of $500.oo as a contribution to the cost of completing the preparation of the Bibliography of Philosophy, contingent upon the balance of the estimated necessary funds being secured. In view of the Council's already extensive assistance to this project and its present limitation of funds for such assistance, this appropriation is a very generous one. Committees Permanent Committee on Bibliography The copy for the bibliography of philosophy for the years i902-i932, which is being sponsored by the Association, will probably be completed by the first of July next. The funds available were exhausted last November, but Professors Coss and Schneider, under whose supervision the work is being done at Columbia University, have volunteered for the time being to assume personally the responsibility for completion. When the amount ultimately expended for completion is known, a request for reimbursement to them will be placed before the Association. The bibliography will consist of two volumes; one an author volume, and the other devoted to a classification by subjects. Estimates for printing costs have been obtained, and they come to about $25,000 for the two volumes. It is believed that when the copy is ready for the printer, out- side financial assistance can probably be obtained to make printing possible. The time required to carry through the printing will be about eight months. For the Committee, C. J. Ducasse, Chairman I76</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION I77 Cars Lectures The committee is gratified to report that members of the Carus family have generously pledged the necessary financial support for a further series of Carus Lectures. The National Board of Officers is -requested to proceed at once to the election of three new members for the Carus Lectures Committee. For the Committee, Edward L. Schaub, Chairman Publication Professor Gregory D. Walcott, General Editor of the Source Books in the History of the Sciences, reports as follows: "Some definite progress on this project has been made this past year. Dr. Weinstein has reported considerable work done toward the Source Book in Zo3logy, and Professor Cohen has indicated the completion of his survey as to what the contents of the Source Book in Ancient Science will be. It is a pleasure to say, too, that a competent translator has been found for the Source Book in Botany, so that we may expect rapid progress in that field. Practically all the selections for that work were made several years ago, but the lack of a good translator caused delay. The prospect now is most encouraging. The manuscript for a Source Book in Geology is still unfinished, but should be -completed soon. It is also worth nothing that the royalties from the Source Book in Physics have equalled the cost of producing that manuscript. Further royalties go to Professor Magee, the special editor of that work." Applications continue to be received for grants in aid of publication offered by the American Council of Learned Societies. One of these has been recommended for a grant by the Committee, and the recommenda- tion has been approved by the Council. The book is by Professor Roger W. Holmes, of Mount Holyoke College, and it has already appeard under the title The Idealism of Giovanni Gentile. Two applications are now being considered by the Committee. Philosophers appear as yet to have found little need for the other form of aid offered by the American Council, namely in the duplication of rare manuscripts. The Committee wishes to call attention to the excellent financial record of the Source Books in the History of the Sciences under Professor Wal- cott's able supervision. So far, interest on the Revolving, Fund, together with royalties on the books already published, have fully paid for all expenses involved in the preparation of these books. For the Committee, E. A. Burtt, Chairman Ninth International Congress of Philosophy The Congres Descartes was held at Paris, August i-6, 1937. Some fifteen members of the American Philosophical Association read papers, and about twice that number were present and participated in the deliberations of the Congress. The Proceedings are published, in twelve volumes, by Hlermann et Cie., Paris. The funds at the disposal of this committee were divided between D. S. Robinson and J. E. Boodin, designated as representatives of</page><page sequence="3">i78 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL.

By unanimous vote the Board of Officers accepted an invitation from the Organizating Committee of the International Congresses for the Unity of Science to act as a sponsoring organization of the Fifth International Congress for the Unity of Science, to be held at Harvard University, September 5-10, 1939. By unanimous vote the Board approved a suggestion from the Western Division that letters be sent to Mrs. Moritz Schlick and to the Rector of the University of Vienna expressing sorrow at Professor Schlick's death and an appreciation of his personality and work. The letters were accord- ingly sent, with the signatures of the Chairman and Secretary of the Board of Officers, as well as those of the President and Secretary of the Western Division.</page><page sequence="5">i8o THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL.

Swenson, were presented: On January II, 1937 Dr. Scott, President Emeritus of Ohio State Uni- versity, died at his home in Columbus, Ohio. He was in his ninety-seventh year, and was probably the oldest member of the American Philosophical Association. He was born in Chauncey, Ohio, September 14, i840, graduated from Ohio University, Athens, Ohio, i862, after three years of study, and was immediately named Superintendent of the Athens schools. He was admitted to the Methodist ministry in i864. After serving a number of charges he was called to the Presidency of his Alma Mater in i872, then to the Presidency of Ohio State University in i883. He continued in this office until I895, teaching philosophy at the same time and remaining on the faculty as Professor of Philosophy until i9io, when he was succeeded by Professor J. A. Leighton. His attention after his retirement was given to continued study and occasional appearances before school groups. His brief address at the dedication of Clinton School, Columbus, came to be regarded -as a classic, and has been used at school dedications throughout the coun- try. He was noted for his high standards combined with kindliness in the administration of his duties. He looked carefully after the material and spiritual welfare of the institution under his charge, with a large concep- tion of the place of the state university in the life of the people. His philo- sophic views were idealistic and his sympathies largely with the standpoint of Lotze. His method in the classroom was Socratic, and he was remem- bered by his students as a stimulating teacher. His lifelong devotion to high ideals in scholarship and public service made him a revered figure in the community. (A. E. Avey) Dr. Norman Wilde, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Minne- sota since i898, and Professor Emeritus since I935, died at Adams, Massa- chusetts, just before the Christmas holidays in December, i936. His scholarly accomplishments are attested by more than a score of articles in the technical journals, dealing with ethical and political subjects; some also dealing with the "faith philosophers" in the tradition of Jacobi. He was also the author of The Ethical Basis of the State, a book widely used and respected for its sanity of outlook. As a teacher he was clear and per- suasive and well prepared; his very presence had, through the thorough assimilation of ideas in his personality, a cultural influence; he was above all a gentleman in tbe classroom, not without the salt of a quiet wit. As a man he was quiet, modest and unaggressive, but withal firm and inde- pendent. He had considerable influence with his colleagues in the formula- tion of educational policy, chiefly because of his cool and trenchant analysis</page><page sequence="7">I82 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVII. and his evident disinterestedness. It was indeed hoped that he would live to finish the work on the history of political philosophies on which he was engaged at the time of his death. Yet his life had in spite of this frustration a beautifully rounded and complete character; his lifework of teaching and thought gave the impression of essentially being done, so that his death was more like a beautiful ending than a tragic interruption. He was a patient, unassuming and reconciling spirit, whose real energy was present in the depths rather than displayed upon the surface. His most outstanding trait was a marked sincerity and a complete integrity of purpose and of act. His nearest colleagues will long feel a sense of deep loss. (David F. Swenson) On recommendation of the Executive Committee the following were elected to membership in the Division: Alice Ambrose, Rudolf Carnap, Henry Cobb, W. V. Evans, A. C. Garnett, Lewis E. Hahn, Roger Hazelton, Morris Lazerowitz, Ray Lepley, J. A. Lynch, Bertram Morris, W. D. Oliver. The following motions were adopted: to extend a vote of thanks to Knox College for its hospitality; to send letters of sympathy to Mrs. Moritz Schlick, and to Professor M. T. McClure; to send letters of thanks to Professor W. Jaeger and to Professor J. W. Beach. Professor D. S. Robinson was elected delegate to the 9th International Congress, and Professor C. M. Perry as delegate to the 3rd Inter-American Congress of Education. It was also voted to instruct Professor G. R. Morrow to proceed with the details of the Unemployment Committee. The following officers were elected: President, J. A. Leighton; Vice- president, Karl Schmidt; Secretary-Treasurer, Alburey Castell; Members of the Executive Committee, V. C. Aldrich, Meritt H.

It was voted to accept the proposal of the National Board of Officers that Article III, Section i, of the Constitution of the American Philosophical Association be amended as follows: "To the first sentence of Section i add, 'and a secretary elected by the foregoing members for a three year term and eligible for re-election'. Strike out sentences four and five of this section." President Prall announced that an invitation had been received from the American Documentation Institute of Washington, D.C., to nominate a member from the American Philosophical Association to serve on the In- stitute. President Prall stated that action would be taken in this matter by the National Board of Officers. The invitation of the University of California for the I938 meeting of the Division was accepted. Since the Pacific Coast Economics Association and the Pacific Sociological Society would also be meeting at the University of California at that time, it was suggested that one joint session be held at which papers from the three associations be presented. It was recom- mended that the Program Commidtee be asked to consider this suggestion. The Executive Committee presented an invitation from the University of Washington that the meeting of the Division be held at that institution in i938 or i939. After discussion, in which it was pointed out that the long distance between Seattle and Los Angeles would make it difficult for members from the south to attend, it was recommended that some ex- pression of willingness to meet in the north in i939 be incorporated in the minutes of this meeting. On recommendation of the Executive Committee, the following were elected to active membership in the Pacific' ivision: Dr. Harry Girvety, Professor Neal K. Klausner, Professor Cornelia G. LeBoutillier, Professor John R. Reid. Henry Lanz and Otis Lee were elected to the Executive Committee for a term of two years. The following officers were elected for 1938: President, R. T. Flewelling; Vice-President, W. R. Dennes; Secretary-Treasurer (for a term of three years), Paul Marhenke. A unanimous vote of thanks was extended to President Edmunds of Pomona College and to the members of the Association at Pomona and Scripps Colleges for their gracious hospitality.

It was voted that all be included in the minutes of the Division, and published in the annual Proceedings, and they are accordingly here included. With deep regret and sorrow we record the death of our colleague, Professor Walter G. Everett, on July 29 last in Berkeley, California. Pro- fessor Everett was born in Rowe, Massachusetts, August 2I, i86o, and entered Brown University in the class of i885, with which he graduated. He obtained the Master's degree in i888, the Doctor's degree in i895, and carried on graduate study for a year at the Universities of Berlin and Strassburg. He began his teaching at Brown in i894 as Instructor in Greek and Latin. His personal interest and particular study, however, had always been centered upon problems of philosophy. Because of this, and in accordance with President Benjamin Andrews' desire at that time to em- phasize the importance of philosophy and to expand the personnel of the department, Professor Everett was in i896 appointed Associate Professor of Philosophy. Later he was appointed Professor of Philosophy and Romeo Elton Professor of Natural Theology, and occupied this chair until his retirement in i930. During the year I9I2-I3 he served as acting-president of Brown University. In I935 Professor Everett was further honored by Brown when, at Commencement, the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred upon him. His retirement from regular teaching marked no cessation of intellectual activity; and for several years thereafter he visited, and delivered lectures at, numerous Colleges and Universities in all parts of the country. In i93i he was signally honored by an invitation to deliver the annual Howison Lecture at the University of California. In I92I Pro- fessor Everett was appointed by the American Philosophical Association a delegate to the Allied Congress of Philosophy in Paris; and in i922 was elected President of the Association. His greatest philosophical reputation both as teacher and writer was achieved in the field of Ethics. His chief work, the treatise entitled Moral Values, received the highest praise in this country and abroad both for its philosophical content and for the outstand- ing excellence of its literary form. It has been and still is widely used as a textbook in courses in Ethics, and a few years ago was translated into</page><page sequence="12">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION I87 Japanese by one of Professor Everett's former students. Professor Everett was further honored in being selected a few years ago in a referendum by the American Philosophical Association as one of thirty-four American Philosophers to contribute one of the essays to the two volume collection entitled Contemporary American Philosophy. Professor Everett made deep and lasting impression on the many students to whom he lectured during his forty years at Brown, for he loved teaching and gave to it of his best; and his charming personality and unfailing courtesy quickly won their regard and affection. As a friend, to colleagues and other associates, he was un- failingly kind, sympathetic, and eagerly helpful. In him indeed, graciousness of manner was no superficial vestment but rather the spontaneous expres- sion of genuine kindliness of spirit and distinction of thought. His students, his colleagues, and in truth all with whom he came in contact felt it a privilege to have known him and to have been associated with him. In his death we have sustained a great loss, but the influence and memory of his devoted work in the service of philosophy will long endure. (C. J. Ducasse) Orlin Ottman Fletcher who died October 20, I937, at the age of go, was one of those superior men who keep their philosophic lights shaded by other interests throughout much of their lives, only to have them burst forth with an unusually illuminating glow in their latter years. Born July 29, i847, in Scotland, Ontario, Canada, his early education was guided by the maxim that "with a good text-book, a good mind and a will to study, no one needed a teacher". He himself, however, became a teacher when but thirteen and taught throughout his teens and early twenties. In his middle twenties, concurrently, he studied law, intending to make that his vocation, but on the death of his young wife in i874, he turned to the ministry. For 34 years, i874-i908, the service of the Baptist Church had his effective statesmanship. Meanwhile, he studied at Chicago University, i880-83, earn- ing both the A.B. and B.D. degrees in three years while preaching, teaching mathematics, proof-reading for the Hebrew Review, and taking charge of President Harper's foreign correspondence. In i886 he took an A.M. degree at Colgate. He was nearing 6i before he found himself in circumstances in which he felt that he could honestly accept a university appointment. Furman University called him at that time, and from I908-27 he taught philosophy and social sciences with a comprehensively informed outlook and a constructive view which led his students characteristically to regard him as by much their greatest teacher. In I9W3 he published his Introduction to Philosophy, a substantial work which circulated over twenty years and won its author an immediate acknowledgment as a strong yet careful thinker. Among the institutions where he lectured on special invitation was Princeton University. Among the manuscripts which he left unpublished were studies in Medieval Philosophy and in contemporary trends and prob- lems. His was a spontaneously inquiring and likewise a continuously syn- thetic mind. Though a Scottish realist from his early background, he became convinced quite soon in life that a pure objective realism ignores the charac- ter of subjects in the experience-equation and lends itself to an unin- telligible pluralistic view. Objective idealism, on the other hand, enabled him to take full cognizance of minds as subjects of experience and of the universe as an intelligible whole and yet to "believe in the substantive reality of cognized objects, in the objective reality of their perceived modifications, in the objective reality of cognized relations, and in the objective reality of value and truth judgments". In practice, as in theory, 0. 0. Fletcher was a realist in his idealism. (W. P. Warren) In the sudden death on September 9, I937 of Moritz A. Geiger, Professor of Philosophy at Vassar College, The American Philosophical Association lost a member of rare intellectual and personal gifts. Born on June 26, i88o in Frankfort, Professor Geiger studied philosophy at Munich, Leipzig, Gbttingen, and also for a time at Harvard when James and Royce were teaching. Thereafter he taught philosophy, first at Munich and then in</page><page sequence="13">i88 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVII. Gottingen until I934, when he left Germany and became chairman of the Department at Vassar College. He was also twice a visiting lecturer at Leland Stanford. Moritz Geiger's philosophical views were formed along the lines of phenomenological realism under the double inspiration of Lipps and Husserl. He wrote with special distinction upon the philosophy of mathematics and of esthetics. What was most characteristic and significant was the living rapport of his philosophical thinking with developments in the general intellectual world of our time, in its sciences and arts. It was this rapport, coupled with a most appealing human warmth and a genial love of teaching, that qualified Moritz Geiger to interpret and exemplify the philosophical spirit to his students in a most effective and genuine sense. The success with which, in the short time of three years, he reworked the technical habits of thought developed during years of advanced work in German universities, so as to become a truly philosophical educator of American undergraduates, was an outstanding achievement, quickly ac- knowledged by the enthusiasm and esteem of his students and colleagues at Vassar. His last published book dealt with the relations between the ap- proach to reality in philosophy and in the sciences. He had recently begun to resume writing after the interruptions occasioned by the last few years. A book on esthetics was virtually completed in manuscript. There also exist chapters of a work devoted to the theme he so finely illustrated in his life: the cultivation of the human personality to a higher form of sub- jectivity by the mind's endeavor to acquire objective science. Though mis- fortune did not allow him to complete his work in America, we were greatly privileged to have his philosophical existence established so effectively amongst us for even a brief time. And we shall like to remember also his understanding enjoyment and appreciation of contacts with students and teachers in this country. (Horace L. Friess) The Nominating Committee (W. H.

The Executive Committee unanimously recommended the approval by the Division of the proposal of the National Board of Officers that Article III, Section i, of the Constitution of the American Philosophical Associa- tion be amended as follows: "To the first sentence of Section i add, 'and a secretary elected by the foregoing members for a three year term and eligible for re-election'. Strike out sentences four and five of this section." By mistaking the provisions for constitutional amendment of the Eastern Division for those of the National Association the unanimous recommenda- tion of approval was presented to the Division but final vote was deferred until the next annual meeting. On recommendation of the Executive Committee it was voted that the National Committee on Bibliography consider bringing up to date Professor Schneider's Bibliography of John Dewey's writings; and that the program committee for I939 plan a divisional meeting (presumably at Columbia) in honor of John Dewey. On motion of Professor Montague a unanimous vote of thanks was extended to Princeton University and especially to the members of its Department of Philosophy for their cordial and gracious hospitality. At the banquet the following resolutions, presented by President Cun- ningham, were adopted: WHEREAS the history of philosophy, as of other branches of scholarship, plainly teaches that freedom of thought, of discussion, of teaching, and of inquiry are essential to the fruitful prosecution of its tasks; and WHEREAS, at the present time, these fundamental rights of the scholar are often invaded in practice and even denied in principle;</page><page sequence="15">I90 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Now therefore we, the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association, assembled at our thirty-seventh annual meeting, do publicly affirm our conviction that unhampered investigation and the free interchange of ideas are indispensable for education and for the development of any high form of social and civic life; And we express to the American Association for the Advancement of Science and to the British Association our hearty approval of their efforts on behalf of the free search for truth, and we authorize the officers of our Association to cooperate with such efforts.
