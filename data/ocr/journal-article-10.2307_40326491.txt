<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHEKHINAH: THE SPECULUM THAT SIGNS, OR "THE FLAMING S/WORD THATTURN[S] EVERY WAY" (GENESIS 3:24) Adeena Karasick According to kabbalistic sources, Shekhinah is the Divine Presence, the im- manent category of the Divine influence. The word derives from shkn, "to dwell/' and was used by rabbis in the first century CE to indicate G-d's1 presence within Israel. The term is never actually employed in the Torah but is alluded to in a variety of related forms, such as mishkan (tabernacle: altar of sacrifice), mashkon (surety, indebtedness), shekhenah or shakhen (neighbor), shekhivah2 or shakhanti (to lie, rest, dwell amongst). And though corresponding to the tenth sefirah, Malkhut (Kingship), the second he of the Tetragrammaton, and signifying both the "mouth" and the "word," Shekhinah is most often understood as the "feminine" principle. "My Sabbaths" ... denotes the circle and the square within and corresponds to Genesis 2:1-3 (commencing Vayikhulu and to kiddush). Each contains 35 words together making 70 and corresponds to the 70 names of the Holy One, blessed be He. (Zohar, I, p. 23)1 The Circle, Square and Point were used by the Kabbalists to symbolize the three highest "sefirot." (Zohar, l:5b-6a)2 If, according to the Zohar, the "circle" and the "square" stand in for the first two sefirot and the 70 names of G-d, by using Circle in the Square as the title for his book on "Studies in the Use of Gender in Kabbalistic Symbolism," Elliot Wolfson appears to foreground sexual difference as differance, a differance that does not propagate a mythology of heterogeneous totality, but promises to acknowledge it as a multiplicity of differential effects. 114 Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women 's Studies and Gender Issues, no. 2. Â© 1999 by Nashim.</page><page sequence="2">Shekhinah: The Speculum that Signs However, according to the Zohar, the Shekhinah is described as "... some- times male and sometimes female"3 - when it prepares blessings for the world it is male, but when it stands in judgment on the world then it is female.4 Further, the Zohar states that "there is a male and there is a female, and even though there is both male and female it is all one."5 "He created them androgynous, as it is said: Male and Female He created them."6 So, though characterized predominantly as "female," Shekhinah need not be locked into an essentialized construct of gendered identity. Through a multigendered [or gen(d)erous] economy, S/he foregrounds sexual difference as not stable or coherent, but located in an external and non-essential place between Female and Male, variable, provisional and contingent. And, thus, "between genders," Shekhinah questions the very notion of biological essentialism, and recognizes the potential for masculinity and femininity in both sexes. If She refers to all that is full, pregnant with life, engendering, and He refers to the provision of "order" and the imposition of necessary limits, "to the letter, [n]e is She. She is [n]e. [n]e or she is the morrow and the blood of the beauty ... ."7 Further, because Shekhinah is also referred to as Malkhut, which corresponds to the masculine potency of G-d ("informs, animates and sustains"), S/he references both male and female attributes. Not only is S/he said to be characterized by the mouth (which can also be seen as the However, endowed with "masculine" privilege(s), Wolfson does not exercise that privilege to displace, question, disrupt or trouble the dominant discourse, but is profoundly in league with a homogeneity that confirms traditional distributions of sexual difference and reinforces a misogynist and heteronormative discourse saturated with phallocentric idealization. In the opening of Chapter Four, "Crossing Gender Boundaries," Wolfson proudly asserts that "the majority of previous studies on gender in the relevant Kabbalistic literature have been marred by a conspicuous lack of sophistication" (p. 79),3 and play on a "naive biologism." Importing his discourse from the cutting edge of cultural anthropology and feminist psychology, Wolfson asserts (p. 4) that he, too, acknowledges the difference between "sexual" and "gender" difference, and insists that he will speak of gender as a sociocultural construction that is a matter of 115</page><page sequence="3">Adeena Karasick vaginal lips [which in themselves "are not one"8]), but, according to the Zohar, S/he is the ateret berit, the corona of the phallus.9 And thus, as the "crown," S/he not only references "the erectile organ of the vulva"10 but the scission, the cut, the wound. Operating as an Irigarayian "ex- cluded middle," S/he then foregrounds how, in Cixousian terms, the body-instrument opposition no longer holds. Transgendered, Shekhinah, then, embodies not an essential male body, or an essential female body: a forbidden body, but the foreboding body, the body unbidden, between the body (corps) body (text), and bodies forth, bides into an ever-expanding body. And inscribed in conflict, contra- diction, S/he problematizes any notion of a static, contained or recog- nizable physicality, and thereby a locatable gendered identity. According to the Kabbalah, the Shekhinah as ecstatic, ephemeral, resurgent, is no where, but is fleeting. S/he, as vessel, has nothing, is nothing but diffusion, liquification. "[S/he] is a mirror reflecting all the other vessels of light, the medium through which the prophet sees his vision ... a speculum; but one that is not clear ... has no light of her own."11 So, though S/he is like a mirror, S/he is represented not in terms of a "Lacanian mirror," which reflects "a simulacral image," a mere reflection, but a "lacunian mirror," a myriad, a mire {amira}. A mirror that contains the engraving of the letters of the holy name with the mystery of the 42 letters with which the worlds were created and which were embedded in it. semiology (reading cultural signs) rather than physiology (marking bodily organs). Ironically, Wolfson's "seminal" exploration of gender revolves around his firm conviction that "there is only one gender in Kabbalistic theosophy" (p. 85) and that gender is male (p. 77). Further, he asserts that "the locus of masculinity and femininity [is] in the phallus." In his introduction, Wolfson insists (p. 2) that in the Kabbalah, "the [bodily] images are meant figuratively and are thus almost always expressed within a parabolic context as literary metaphors" (or "metaphorical characterizations ... rather than any hypostatic elements" [p. 3]). However, he proceeds to fetishize an anthropomorphic reading that gravitates around the anatomical dictatorship of the penis, and uses it to further exclude women or any notion of femaleness, under the rubric of deletion, sublation, erasure. Wolfson asserts that a kabbalistic reading of Genesis posits that female is 116</page><page sequence="4">Shekhinah: The Speculum that Signs And if, according to Ezra of Gerona, Shekhinah is called temunah ha-kolelet kol ha-temunot (the image that comprises all the images),12 S/he is an image of that which cannot be contained, embodied or possessed; an image that is always already reproduced in a hyperreality of simulation. Similarly, according to the Zohar, Shekhinah is called Kalah ha-kelulah min ha-kol (the bride incorporated from everything). "She has nothing at all of Her own,"13 no specific and positive potency of Heirs own, but wanders almost faceless, as everything flows into Heirm, and manifests through Heirm. "[S/he] is called Who. Who is that? An intuitive flash illuminating and disappearing, as sunbeams play on the surface of water."14 So, like the Cixousian notion of how the libidinal feminine has no presence, has nothing, Shekhinah must not be read as "nothing," as non-being, non-effectivity, non-life, but as "an excess of excess,"15 as synnexes annexes in cathexis or a nexus of desire. This is further exemplified where, for Derrida, "the tabernacle ... remains a signifier without signified. [T]he structure encloses its void within itself, shelters only its own proper interiorized desert, opens onto nothing, confines nothing, contains as its treasure only nothingness: a hole, an empty spacing ... . No center, no heart, an empty space, nothing."16 Shekhinah, then, not only like the libidinal feminine, but as the Torah itself, is inscribed in an excessive receptivity, which attracts and lets come; which grows, spawns and makes happen. So, though S/he is nothing, has nothing, S/he part of the male - the "Yahwist" versions of creation depict how woman came from man, and thus is viewed as secondary and derivative. Unfortunately, Wolfson ignores the verse from the Zohar (1:182a) which says, "Adam and Eve were created side by side." Not "of the side," or "from the side" or "by the way side," but synchronistically: As it is said, "male and female He created them, and blessed them" (Genesis 5:2). Further, the Zohar states, "the secret of the matter is that blessings reside only in the place where male and female are together." Woman, then, as "Kol ha-Torah" comments, "is neither man's shadow nor his servant but his other self - so that the two together form a complete human unit."4 Creation is thus inscribed in multiplicity, diversity, heteroglossia. Further, according to the Zohar, when it is said, "And the Lord God formed Man: 'Man' here refers to Israel, whom God shaped at that time both for this world and for the future world" (Zohar, l:25b-26a). "Man," then, does not 117</page><page sequence="5">Adeena Karasick both receives all light to illuminate the body, and provides everything*. And, "it is through [Heirm] that the latent and potential creation emerges into manifest reality and substantiality. Everything passes through her,"17 becomes [Heirm]. Further, Shekhinah is inscribed in the Zohar as "the maiden without eyes." Though according to Wolfson this signifies that S/he is "blind" or without sense,18 this reading is perverse, as "without eyes" necessitates not no sense, but heightened sense. For example, the female figure representing Justice in the American justice system is portrayed blindfolded, not to suggest that she is senseless but rather to emphasize her heightened role as unbiased arbitrator.19 Also, retranslated through an economy of spectrality, sacrality, alterity, "eyes" as in 'ayin transliterated as 'ein (as in Ein SoJ) is both "nothing" and "everything" (the letter 'ayin signifies the 70 names of G-d).20 So, as that which both sees and is scene, both present and absent, Shekhinah inscribes Heirmself as a hypersubjective surplus of supplemen- tarity and exchange. Thus, not based on masculine thrift, a hedonistic accumulation, but on spending, excess. And as excess, Shekhinah must then be reviewed not as the passive female principle, but as an active, creative force who bursts forth in all [Heirs] strength and fury. And though S/he receives all things, they enter Heirm shapeless, but emerge from Heirm; with form. Thus, S/he problematizes a traditional notion of receiving and refer to "He" who is proper, singular, unique, but to an irreducible complexity that embodies a range of differences, fractures, interruptions, contradictions, aporias, inconsistencies. Thus, according to much of the Kabbalah, women are not secondary and derivative, supplemental and ontically inferior, but (as in the post-Rousseauean conception of writing as a grammatological discourse) are simultaneous, and mark a spectrum of differences and caesuras. Though the Kabbalah clearly asserts that both male and female are present in a polysemous simultaneity or a palimpsestic compound (and "emphasizes time and again that the complete anthropos comprises masculine and feminine" [p. 91]), Wolfson freely translates this to mean that "a Kabbalistic representation of androgyny is that of one male force" (p. 80), where "the female is enfolded back into the male whence she derived" (p. 91). His book thus uses Kabbalah to further his own 118</page><page sequence="6">Shekhinah: The Speculum that Signs reinscribes it (as Kabbalah21) as an active gesture of ferocity and exultation, an economy of pulsations, production and exchange. According to the Zohar, Shekhinah is situated at the lower extremity of the world of emanation and at the top of the non-divine worlds. Also, in aggadic literature, S/he is represented as the divine presence, yet is simultaneously existing and active in the world, among the people of Israel. Thus, as both head of the created world and within it (as both part of the system and ruler of the system), "S/he" is both inside and outside. Thus, between transcendence and immanence, S/he breaks down any notion of separation - what's inside is recited/resited in a site of desire. S/he's inside out and untoward. Undecided or beside Heirm self. Similarly, according to the Zohar, the Shekhinah is the last link in the chain of emanation. Acting as a receptacle for the supernal flow of influence, S/he represents the extreme limit of divine being.22 Yet, in relation to the lower world, S/he is the very beginning and highest point. Thus, Heirs presence is contextual. Meaning is constructed in terms of position, perspective. Similarly, "there is the Shekhinah below and the Shekhinah above. The Shekhinah is above in the twelve chariots and among the twelve supernal creatures, the Shekhinah is below among the twelve holy tribes."23 Thus, S/he questions any notion of static hierarchical constructs. Heirs place, displaced in a field of hyperspatial interplays. For Derrida, the Text is not cut off from the Voice, but the Voice resides phallocentric conviction that women must be eclipsed by male genitalia, masked within "the reductive stinginess of the masculine-conjugal subjective economy,"5 an anatomical taxonomy that solicits a penetrating, colonizing regime of supremacy. Even though the Zohar posits how certain sefirot are likened to female breasts, how Shekhinah (often engendered female) is likened to the vaginal lips, Wolfson asserts, through violent misreading, "the feminine aspect of G-d in its ontological root is portrayed as the corona of the penis" (p. 91). He then repeats this manipulation of kabbalistic text: "the aspect of the divine that corresponds to the feminine, the tenth gradation, is linked anatomically either to the corona of the penis or to the tongue of the singular masculine form" (p. 81, emphasis added). Further, Wolfson proclaims, 119</page><page sequence="7">Adeena Karasick there, in the language; ever-translating, mut(ill)ating. "The absent interlocutor is not outside; (but) sleeps in the valley of text, a bed or surface of letters ... .24 Similarly, though Shekhinah is in exile (living with Israel), S/he is not divorced from the sefirotic system, but remains "connected" to it because of Heirs inseparable connection with Tiferei. For, according to the Zohar, "with speech (Shekhinah) and with breath (Tiferei) together [is] the world made."25 Thus, through language and breath (like the Oral and the Written Torot), not only does "one not proceed without the other, [but they are] comprised together."26 Through an ever-evolving synchronous productivity, or a palimpsestic process, Shekhinah fore- grounds how S/he is never singular, proper or unique, but carries the trace of Tiferei with Heirm. However, though Shekhinah is still connected to Tiferei, to her male counterpart, S/he does not get (as Wolfson insists throughout Circle in the Square21) elided into him. S/he does not get colonized, eclipsed or erased, but as her identity in exile is both disparate and connected, S/he is always-already a part oj, apart from, and party to. Cut off and into, S/he re- inscribes a spectrographic etiology where He is not active, dominant and primary, and She is not passive, dominated and secondary. the task of "homo religiosus" is to overcome the apparent sexual duality so that the female is re-integrated into the male ... to restore the feminine to the masculine, to unite the two in a bond that overcomes gender differentiation by establishing the complete male (p. 82, emphasis added). It is the task of the female to become male, (p. 92) because femaleness is in fact only an aspect of masculinity (p. 80, emphasis added). Wolfson, thus, presents what is "female" as "abjected other," as difference; but not a difference inscribed in differentially, a production or system of relational differences, but a homeostatic enclosure where woman is grafted onto man and remains his property, propriety and in the name of the name is forced to name herself as unnameable, sur-named in the name of the other. Through this supposedly gender-conscious text, what is female 120</page><page sequence="8">Shekhinah: The Speculum that Signs Thus, marked by traces, specters, echoes of an absent presence, S/he remains simultaneously independent and connected. Simultaneous transcendence and immanence are particularly fore- grounded in the inscription of Heirs name. As in Leviticus 26:11, "I will place my tabernacle [mishkan] among you," mishkan may be read as mashkon, surety or indebtedness. Thus, between mishkan and mashkon, as both tabernacle and indebtedness, S/he becomes both the word and the debt.28 So, in a system of reciprocal indebtedness - expanding and contracting rings of alliance - Shekhinah becomes a trace of an event of donation that can never have taken place. As S/he both takes and gives, gives to take, S/he problematizes any established propriety or property or what is properly called.29 Further, as S/he spends and is spent in a non- negotiable currency, an expenditure without accountability or in the resources of loss, S/he becomes G-d's supplement: "a surplus, a plenitude enriching another plenitude."30 Shekhinah, then, as collateral, becomes the present non-present of a collaborate, elaborate labor of the literal, iterable substitution and exchange. Both inside and outside, above and below. Shekhinah further foregrounds Heirs heterogeneity in that S/he embodies both light and darkness, containing the attribute of the day in the night and the attribute of the night in the day.31 However, though S/he transmits infinite radiance, it is said that "darkness envelops her." S/he is simultaneously seen as a dark cloud during the bright day and a bright fire appears as the unsigned, landless mass, a beastly aberration that attests to a non-human status - and whose sexuality as potentially voracious, insati- able, enigmatic, must remain invisible and unknowable. Similarly, Wolfson recites an anonymous kabbalistic text which points out that the Genesis phrases "in our image" and "in our likeness," said of the creation of human beings, male and female, refer to the "Written" and "Oral" Torah, respectively. And, for Wolfson, "the secret of unity ultimately involves the merging of the female into the male and not the preservation of their ontic distinctiveness" (p. xiii); he decides that "the union of the Written Torah and the Oral Torah is, in effect, the reintegration of the feminine in the masculine" (p. 83). 6 However, the word "union" does not imply dominance of one over the other, does not imply one as derivative, superfluous, peripheral or supplemental. But between absorption and nonabsorption, differences bleed through each other. 121</page><page sequence="9">Adeena Karasick during the dark night.32 But, if day is marked by clarity, reason, illumination, S/he reigns at night But though S/he "has no light of her own" and is marked by darkness, S/he is not the black hole, the empty space, a silence, but (as "The Dark Continent is neither dark nor unexplorable"33), S/he radiates in ammassive mystery, incoherence. For, according to the Zohar, the black light and the white light are only two manifestations of one indivisible light. Or similarly, according to the kabbalistic axiom, the world was created "white fire on black fire." Each one complementary, an inseparable part of. So, although Shekhinah is said to be "revealed at night,"34 S/he remains S'ecriture of the night. Not an absence but that which abscesses, obsesses, infuses into. Not a silence, but a salience and marked by that which is simultaneously lucid and ludic, rational, irrational and relational. In the Kabbalah, Shekhinah is represented by the Tree of Knowledge, which contains the death force. Thus, as a thanatopraxis en proxy, S/he simultaneously represents life and death. Further, according to the Wisdom of the Zohar, S/he contains not only the attribute of Gevurah (Judgment), but also the Sitra Achra (the Other Side) - and thus embodies both holiness and impurity, cleanliness and contamination. However, according to the Tanya, the evil inclination in (wo)man is an instrument for the love of G-d. For it is written, "And you shall love the Eternal, your G-d, with all your heart" (Deuteronomy 6:5). "With all your heart" means with both Neither is present or absent, but they are always already traces, specters, echoes of each other. Kabbalistic exegesis does not posit a hierarchical binarie structure, where one totalized, identifiable or contained force obliterates an other; annihilates, diminishes, stifles or dislocates the other; it rather posits how what is "male" or "female" appear as indeterminate extraintentional differential productions ejected between forces and intensities. Further, acknowledging that "every other is [every bit] other,"7 unity (as in the sefirotic compounds, as in G-d) implies not a oneness, a wholeness, but a disintegrated unity inscribed in iterable alterity. So, just as "diachrony" becomes a succession of "synchronic" states or as parole moves into languey throughout kabbalistic hermeneutic praxis, man and woman do not eclipse each other but, in a palimpsestic process, cannot be separated one from the other. Unfortunately, Wolfson is not offering this view. Wolfson's text prioritizes one term over the other. Fetishizing 122</page><page sequence="10">Shekhinah: The Speculum that Signs inclinations, evil and good. Similarly, it is stated that "the perfection of all things is attained when good and evil are intermingled ... for there is no good except if it issues out of evil."35 And, as Derrida points out in The Gift of Death,36 death is carried like the trace of a signature: mortality (finitude) is inscribed in all that is living. Further, according to the Zohar, evil is constructed out of the waste and refuse of holiness. Thus, it is necessary to see that what is holy and pure and what is contaminated are never separate and distinct, but feed off each other in a parasitical process. And if kelipot means "shells" or "husks," the outer shells that contain the edible fruit but are themselves inedible, then what is "pure" cannot be separated from what is "impure" Oust as "same" cannot be separated from "other"). Historically, "the Other" is viewed as savage, unknowable. And, just as "the kelipot ... consist of the unassimilable parts of the broken vessels,"37 the Other is marked by that which cannot be absorbed into a system; that which does not fit in, and remains always already excluded, outside. Shekhinah, then, who holds the Other within Heirm, not only implies the "disintegration of any notion of unity," but problematizes the relation of Self and Other. Of Same and Other. Foregrounds how the "same" is always something "other" [in or o(u)t(h)er], and becomes Other to Heirmself or a self of Others.38 Thus, marked by multiplicity, diversity, excess, abundance and overflow, Shekhinah then cannot be contained even by a single name. According to the Transcendental Phallus object, Wolfson refuses to acknowledge that every signifier refers to other signifiers, and that it is impossible to ever reach a signified referring only to itself. Further, any dream of Unity, of Sameness, that overcomes difference is locked within some transcendental fantasy of universalized transparency that (not only ignores the heterogeneous nature of kabbalistic discourse, but) locates itself within a spectrum of writing that valorizes an Autocratic, Totalitarian regime of Truth, Authenticity and Representation; which erects an "apparatus of power" and propagates the monocentrism of the colonial enterprise. It is disappointing that Wolfson, given his opening remarks, about "gender sensitivity," would continue to enforce a patriarchal etiology that reeks of narcissistic male power and dominance, authority and privilege in the name of kabbalistic hermeneutics. The critique becomes almost farcical when Wolfson finds that the kabbalistic texts obviously cannot support his 123</page><page sequence="11">Adeena Karasick the Wisdom of the Zohar, S/he is also called "Shoshana" (Lily), "Princess," "Queen," "Moon," "Lower Mother," "Bride," "Earth," "Sabbath," and is referred to as a window, a channel for transmission, a gate or a door. Thus, as a series of entrances, exits (ex-schize), chains of multiple combinations of non-synonymous substitutions, supplements, S/he cannot be gathered, stabilized into some ideal lexicon, but rather references the conditions of (im)possibility. And though the Zohar attempts to fix/measure/compart- mentalize Heirm into a recuperable unit: "She herself is 26,000 myriads of parasangs long,"39 through not only an unmeasurable economimesis, but a re-doubling of subjectivity, Shekhinah is foregrounded as a heteroglossic enunciative process that cannot be encapsulated, positioned or contained. Fluid, en fluxus, S/he rises and arouses as a flowing measure (which overflows as S/he is extended and extends as S/he overflows) and flows over Heirs name. So, as Heirs name mnemes, beyond the name of the name S/he is named by and names all that is impossible, plausible, plaisable, re- placeable. With multiple signifiers, referents and networks of referrals, S/he signs Heirmself between pseudonymy, metonymy, cryptonymy, anonymy and monstrous autonomy. This lexicological excess is particularly foregrounded in that according to kabbalistic hermeneutics, Shekhinah stands in for the word Davar: Exposing the fullness of speech, S/he spells out all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet: ale) to tov, and becomes the writ(h)ing, the lips, the misogynist ideals. Erecting another compensatory fiction, he boldly professes: Even when a given text overtly refers to God in feminine terms, it is implicitly speaking about the male deity, and most specifically the corona of the penis (p. 107). Chapter three, whose title, "Erasing the Erasure," seems to promise an investigation of how women have been absented in male readings of kabbalistic hermeneutics, unfortunately does not erase the erasure, but erases any possibility for woman to exist, outside of being a cipher, a nullity, a vacancy: to be marked, scarred, inscribed upon for man's "creative" purposes. Anchored in militant phallogocentric sublation, Wolfson not only enforces a misogynistic mythology, historically saturated 124</page><page sequence="12">Shekhinah: The Speculum that Signs wound, the word. And, inscribed through the embodiment of exile, Shekhinah (as a decontextualized trope references "not the being-of-the-end [the goal], but ... how-far-being-reaches"40; [in]finitely trajectoral and inconclusive, S/he wanders estranged, in anguish, in language41) performs how language itself is always fluid, in effusion, diffused through migrancy, translation, re-production. Illocatable in echolocate locii, a locus of locutions, S/he re-assembles and dissembles; a moving ensemble that resembles and becomes an on-going cultural-lingual performance - a multiaccentual politics of desire that confounds the ordering of a semi(o)tic hegemony. And though the most important symbolic categories of Lurianic myth are drawn from the imagery of human anatomy, biological development and human sexuality, Shekhinah, standing in for the "mouth," the "lips," the "tongue," stands in for a bodiless body that is always the becoming- fetish of the commodity. S/he is not represented as an immediately visible commodity, but, inscribed in a multiplicity of gendered constructs, S/he references the body that bodies forth. A body that is always something else, in relation, in transference, in flight. Thus, as text, which can never be contained or represented, Shekhinah is (as the tenth sefirah) always-already inscribed as "the appearance of the semblance of the Presence of the Lord" (Ezekiel 1:26-28). But as S/he has no bodily likeness of, S/he is re- assembled in the semblance of. S/he is inscribed in virtuality, possibility, with patriarchal assumptions (pen as penis, letters as virile semen and the tablet as woman),8 but further asserts that the penis and the brain are connected. And, with his claim that "the writing of secrets is a decidedly phallic activity" (p. 74),9 Wolfson determines that women are not only sociologically but physiologically excluded from ontological reality. Further, if, according to the Sefer Yetzirah, the world is created through language, through the interplay of letters, and if he is "inscribing letters upon her" (p. 77), he is engaging in a creative activity, of re-production and ex-change, and "she" is once again viewed as his possession, his property; a transferential object, a product of his making. Wolfson then goes on to point out that the Hebrew and Latin word peles means both "scale" and "phallus," respectively, and thus draws the fallacious conclusion that, once again, the penis is the measure of all things. Wolfson does not title his book The Circle AND the Square, which might 125</page><page sequence="13">Adeena Karasick potentiality. AS IF (in-formation or informed by). Re-formed, a performative body, en mode, "made" a la mode (mod) or modeled on, S/he is always only an image, an homage. And, according to the the Wisdom of the Zohar, "even though we are made in the image and likeness [of G-d], do not think for a moment that 'eye' is in the form of a real eye or that 'hand' is in the form of a real hand."42 A body double, dubbed in a redoubling. So, surpassing the senses, as the sensuous-nonsensuous resonant sense, a consensus of since, S/he enters the senses as sensucht (desire). S/he erupts as a madness, celebrating multiplicity, diversity. Not inscribed in lack (in blindness), in absence, but slack, excess. Because what is lost is a loss of what can never be possessed, S/he does not possess but processes. And if, in Sefer Sitre Torah, Abulafia likens the combinations of the letters to the construction of the body, of various limbs and organs: "all of the limbs of [the] body are combined one with the other,"43 and Shekhinah references the word, the language, the letters, S/he then references the body (text). In a sapirous reciprocity, the body proper poisoned is improper and inappropriately propelled into the body corps body (encore, encorps). A body of traces, as catachresis retraces appearance, and departs as sediments cling in a 'patacidical sucking, a synechdoche. deictic where dis[sic]ecrit dis-eases in metalepsis, dehiscence, abscesses. Thus, S/he is not the erotic body, but the rotting body, the wrought body denote an equitable alliance, but insists yet again in the very title that the feminine is placed within male domination. According to Wolfson's reading of Kabbalah, what is "female" must be acknowledged only as a subsidiary to be placed inside; shielded, masked, erased. Further, to say "the square" locates maleness in particularized specificity, identity. "She, " however, as "circle," has no referent of her own, but is placed within a generalized framework, a universalized arena that speaks of non-identity, non- specificity, non-being. Thus, with no context of her own, she becomes only a trace, a spectral presence to be generously read within the rubric of his referent: in THE square. This construction is particularly ironic, given that, according to Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel, since the sixth day of Creation, there is no square shape in creation, as squares imply abrupt changes of direction.

A no-body in the image of an image. An homage - where bodily boundaries blur, bond, blend, band, bound into a social body. A blemished body of emissions, secretions, discharges, pollutions. A body of orifices, folds and contaminations. A viral body, of stains, strains (sic), filthy and transgressive, disfigured and impure. A procreating body in fluvial effusion that is fertile, fruitful (sweet to the taste) and reproduces itself - a foreign body. A fluid body (of bodily fluids, bodily processes), a bodily act which dis-embodies, embodies, increases in de-creases, traces appearance. Multiplies and becomes numerous. Thus, S/he is not sublime but subliminal, always on the edge of in/finite hesitation. On the threshold. Because Heirs body is parts. Always already elliptical paths (Talmud Yerushalmi, Nedarim 3:2). Further, if, as the Zohar posits, the Circle, Square and Point were used by the kabbalists to symbolize the three highest sefirot (Zohar, l:5b-6a), in using only the "Circle" and the "Square,11 Wolf son misses the point. According to the Zohar, the point is acknowledged as the mystical symbol of the world. For it is the point that receives all light to illuminate the body and provide everything: "the central point of a circle on which the whole circle depends" (Zohar, 1:229a). The point is in the middle of the world, and the world expanded from there: to the right and to the left and upon all sides. The world is sustained by this central point.10 In failing to acknowledge the point, Wolfson has not only put the third 127</page><page sequence="15">Adeena Karasick a/part of and apart from. The body bursting, body burning is not "well defined," but Heirs definitions s/well. Surface between (the) body and [ ] erasure of the body erupting. Heirs frame surges as a surrender descends, resounding in an insistent resistance. So, exiled into the exteriority of the body, infinitely expansive, S/he opens Heirmself from within Heirmself as a translation, a movement, a becoming; embedded in a merging of a resurgence of all that precedes, lies beside. And in exile, Heirs body has no place, but bodies between; bodes well, swells in a supple place splayed out in hyperspatial interplays: sensorious, sinuous, sensing. And, as Lawrence Fine points out, "to deliberately exile oneself ... is a symbolic act of humility."44 "A person should exile [Heirm]self from place to place for the sake of Heaven, and in this way [S/he] will become a vessel for the exiled Shekhinah ... [S/he] should humble [Heirs] heart in exile and bind [Heirm]self to the Torah, and then the Shekhinah will accompany [Heirm]. And [S/he] should carry out Gerushin by exiling [Heirm]self from [Heirs] house of rest constantly."45 Thus, in self exile, S/he inscribes Heirmself in ex-stasis, in an a-t(r)opic no- place, plaisir, plays of mounds and crevices where S/he opens Heirmself from within Heirmself. Inscribed in diffusion, liquification. An unterritorialized space marked by folds and pockets. But Heirs pockets overflow. S/he pockets Heirmself in a texture and folds into a virtual space. A (n)e(u)rotics of space. Duration. sefirah, Binah, or understanding, under erasure, but has eradicated the point on which both the circle and the square depend. Through his politically inappropriate, unethical misreading and manipula- tion of kabbalistic texts, Wolfson determines that gender equality means that women's place is under the domain of male authority: She is nothing but a part of him, created by and through him. Thus, Wolfson has rewritten the female as a parasite, which (as in the Signified/Signifier opposition) lives, feeds off the primary term - in this case, male power. However, even though it is evident that no "autos" is possible without an inscription of "alterity"; no "inside" without a relation to an "outside" (which cannot be simply outside, but must remark itself on the inside), even attempting to render "difference" as "same," that "same" will always be inhabited or haunted by the Other. And though his text promises to "... examine the phenomenon of gender 128</page><page sequence="16">Shekhinah: The Speculum that Signs And if, according to the Zohar, Shekhinah is the embodiment of Binah (the third sefirah, who references the tongue) and Yesod (the ninth sejirah, who references the phallus), and they are brought together through "the kiss," S/he is not fully represented by any particular body part, but by an act of devotion, of unification, of intimacy - As her tongue, teeth, lips part, solypse sip in prolixis licks. A ventriloquist kiss in the darkness of slick kissery articulate, ex-schize kiss caught in the covets risks limits lip slips en ellipse slick distance with desire. And though according to the Tanya, Shekhinah is called "Mouth of G-d" (the word of the Eternal and the Breath of his Mouth by which the world came into actual manifest being, the organ of speech by means of which the speaker's inner thought and emotive dispositions are expressed and revealed),46 as S/he embodies the revealed aspect of G-d, according to Derrida, the revealed is always hidden. "The revealed is the disclosure of the hidden and its dissemination."47 Thus, Shekhinah foregrounds how the revealed is always that which is secret, secreted. So, just as Shekhinah "assumes form," S/he does not embody a particular truth, identity, topos, transformation in terms of the female becoming mate and the male becoming female" (p. xiii), we soon realize that both types of transformation are predicated on the ontological assumption that the female is part of the male. So, even though the Kabbalist Pinehas of Korets states, "the two of them [male and female] are of equal stature,"11 Wolfson puts this "under erasure" and asserts, Despite the reference in the above passage to the attainment of an equal stature on the part of the male and female, the fact of the matter is that the gender hierarchy is not fully overcome ... [until] ... the female is transformed into an aspect of the male (pp. 120-121). Thus, throughout Circle in the Square, Wolfson does not problematize, interrogate or question these traditional assumptions, but reaffirms an 129</page><page sequence="17">Adeena Karasick tropos or secret, because that secret is always "invented." Rather, Heirs manifestation is a secreting; a secret that "bleeds," is infected, swells and pusses in the gaps. And if Heirs cause is a secret within a secret that only another secret can explain, it is a secret about a secret that is veiled by a secret.48 So, between sacrality and alterity, the secret as the sacred is not something cryptic and concealed, but something that cannot be possessed, contained or understood. And, as S/he presents Heirmself cryptically, Shekhinah is always the name of a secret, since S/he signs the irreplaceable singularity. As G-d or death, S/he puts forth the common name of a secret, the common name of the proper name without name. So, beyond the name and beyond the name of name S/he names all that is possible "as" impossible. And if, according to the Bahir, "Your name is in You, and in You is Your name,"49 to name the unnameable, Shekhinah names without naming, between what's manifest and secret, what's private and public. So, in a process of veiling and unveiling ("an unveiling that only happens by surprise, by accident and with a brutality that shatters"50), of folds that flailing fall and fold in on - a sacred space that is secret and readable, revealed, concealed and makes manifest, Shekhinah becomes a struggle of silences on silence in disappearance onto-theological, historico-cultural mythology genealogized from father to son, which propagates a politically dangerous hierarchy that serves to enslave women to a discourse of phallocentric power, subjugation and violence. Caught in a metaphysical determination of Presence, Truth and Nostalgia, though Elliot Wolfson's book is a lovely "feminine," genitallic, metallic purple shade, as his subtitle suggests, Circle in the Square becomes "Studies in the USE of Gender in Kabbalistic Symbolism." Privileging the Signifier in the determination of meaning, he uses gender to propagate a self-admiring, self-stimulating, self-congratulatory phallocentrism. 130</page><page sequence="18">Shekhinah: The Speculum that Signs When beyond the veil or under the veil is to look at the veil revile when the truth shall make you veiled "veil [as if]/ the veil" of unknowing. Valency veils. When everything is veil (veil smear) valour or an unveiling unavailable veiling S/he avails/not violating in evol volumes. Thus, in conflict with traditional kabbalistic hermeneutics, Shekhinah must no longer be read as a passive, female principle, but as an irreducible complexity, one that embodies a range of heterogeneous possibilities, contradictory strata, lexicological disparities, and as an embattled arena that interrogates phallocentric notions of Truth, Authenticity, Singularity and Hierarchy (binarie constructs that inhibit, constrain, confine and close down). S/he foregrounds gendered (dis)identity as a body of pulsations, porosities, a physio-social linguistic construction, a semiological function. And as a spurious (in)finity with no taxonomical closure, Shekhinah becomes a secret without secret of flexions, reflections - a confluence of velocities, (re)assemblances, of consignatory sonorities conjugated at the threshold of dissociation.51 Wolfson thus sets up a Transcendental Signifier (the Phallus) which communicates straightforwardly with the most traditional phallocentrism, which reeks of nonmobility, asphyxiation, compression and disease. So, as Wolfson accurately points out in the preface, the issues surrounding gender in kabbalistic ritual and myth have "not been adequately addressed in scholarly literature" (p. xiii), massively masculine in its supposed neutrality, Wolfson "touches upon the problem of gender ... in essential ways" (pp. xi-xii). He does not contest that tradition, but reinforces it; and these issues still remain unanswered, and improperly acknowledged. 131</page><page sequence="19">Adeena Karasick Notes (upper text) 1. Throughout this text, G-d is inscribed with a dash between the letters G and d, to foreground His/Her ever-presence/non-presence; that S/he cannot be contained inside language, that this inscription is always already only a trope, a word, a graphemic re-imaging, in which S/he cannot be fully or properly expressed or represented. Similarly, not only does inscribing S/he foreground G-d as a multi- gendered or gen(d)erous economy (not locked into any notion of anthropomorphic staticity), but the "s" both inside and outside of the syntagm mimics the Shekhinah both inside and outside (both a part of and apart from) the Sefirotic system. Intra- gendered diffusion is further foregrounded through the doubled pronoun of His/Her, simultaneously referencing both male and female attributes. According to the Zohar, the second he of the Tetragrammaton metonymically stands in for Shekhinah (which I have transliterated as the letter h), and like the "s" in S/he, remains both inside and outside of the remainder of the syntagm. In the case of (Him/Her), the remaining letters anagrammatically comprise the word "mire," and thus stand in for the encrypted abyss through which gender gets merged, muddied, transmuted. In the case of His/Her, the remaining letters form the word reis, which in German is: to travel, voyage. This again foregrounds how gender is never static but travels, travailles between codes, idioms, constructs. 2. Though shekhivah (as lying down) has been read by some kabbalists as connoting the (undermined) position of the female in relation to the male, I think it is interesting to note that in the movement from shekhivah to Shekhinah there is the inclusion of the letter nun, which in kabbalistic terms not only references the Shekhinah itself but graphemically implies "sitting up." Thus, Shekhinah must be acknowledged as not passively lying down beneath the male, awaiting reception, but as S/he who is sitting up, powerful and alert - looking to the future. 3.

According to Isaiah Tishby, though she is said to embody the attribute of Judgment, it is not as in Gevurah (rigorous judgment); rather she is called "lenient judgment." See Tishby, Wisdom of the Zohar.An Anthology of Texts (ed. by Albert H. Friedlander, Louis Jacobs and Vivian D. Lipman; English transÃ­, by David Gold- stein; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), I, p. 375. It is interesting to note that although both Shekhinah and Gevurah (as "female" attributes) are said to embody various forms of "judgment," women are not permitted to be judges by Jewish law. 5.

And though He created "them," He called their name Adam (Adamah: "from the 132</page><page sequence="20">Shekhinah: The Speculum that Signs earth"). Further, according to the Zohar, "the Lord God created [va-yyitser] Man [adam] with two yods. He completed the adornments within adornments like a seal. This is yyitser. Why are there two yodsl This is a secret of the Holy Ancient One and a secret of the Small Countenance. What is va-yyitser [shaped]? Tsar is a shape [tsura] within a shape. And what is a shape within a shape? The two names which are called the full name of the Lord God. And this is the secret of the two yods of 'He created a shape within a shape.' He shaped the complete name - The Lord God. And in what are they included? In this Supernal form which is called Adam which includes male and female, and thus it is written, et ha-Adam ... comprehends male and female" (Zohar, III:145a-b, emphasis added). 7. HÃ©lÃ¨ne Cixous, Vivre le Orange (Paris: des femmes, 1969), p. 33 (transliteration mine). Though this is traditionally seen as a view of G-d and not necessarily human gender, given that Shekhinah is always already described in gendered terminology, I thought it appropriate for this context. According to the Wisdom of the Zohar, "in her role of judgment, Shekhinah is called Adonai, but once she is linked with Hesed and Rahamim, she becomes he of the Tetragrammaton" (I, p. 404), the lower he of YHVH. The he is graphically inscribed as "a half moon with a point." The point, standing in for tziyyun/Zion, the mystical symbol of the world, is in the center - and receives all light to illuminate the body, and provides everything. He is also the Hebrew definite article, and thus marks the "indefinite definite," d/infinity of illumination. Metonymically, it stands in for HaShem (The Name). To name the unnameable, she names without naming (between pseudonymy, metonymy, homonymy, anonymy), naming all that is possible as impossible, always already a part oj and apart from. 8.

It is also significant to note that rabbinic tradition uses the expression sagi nahor - literally, "full of light" - for "blind." In medieval Christian iconography, the synagogue is a beautiful maiden who is blindfolded or blind. 20. In Hebrew, 'ein is written with an aleph (the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet), and 'ayin with the letter 'ayin (the sixteenth letter). In addition to referring to the seventy names of G-d, 'ayin also means "being," "spring" or "foundation," and is the first word in the axiom of Divine Providence: 'Ayin shel 'atah / 'Ayin shel ma'alah. It thus refers to the upper and lower worlds simultaneously. 21. In Hebrew, kabbalah means "reception" - particularly by way of the mouth. 22.

The Zohar, however, also states that '"in our image' corresponds to light, after our likeness to darkness, which is a vestment to light the same way that the body is a vestment to the soul" (I: 22a-22b). Thus, the black light and the white light, being only two manifestations of one indivisible light, are not separate, distinguishable, but, as the voice and writing, are echoes, traces, ghosts of each other, inscribed in and through an ever-generative process. 7.

It would be interesting here to recall Sandra M. Gilbert's "Literary Paternity" (in Adams and Searle, Critical Theory since 1965 [above, note 5], p. 487), where she asserts that this compensatory fiction is borne out of man's anxiety that he cannot verify his fatherhood: "The unity or integrity of the text is maintained by a series of genealogical connections: author-text, beginning-middle-end, text-meaning, reader- interpretation and so on. Underneath all these is the imagery of succession, of paternity, or hierarchy." Thus, Wolfson, too, as "author, is father, progenitor, procreator, an aesthetic patriarch whose pen is an instrument of generative power like his penis" (ibid, p. 488) to create posterity to which he lays claim. 10.
