F. H. BRADLEY. Mind, No. 6o, PP. 445-472. The world cannot be sharply sundered into a realm of ' facts' and a realm of ' ideas.' Such a rigid division is founded on a false identification of reality with the so-called world of fact. The author shows the fallacious nature of three distinctions founded on this false principle. (I) A ' floating' idea is one which essentially fails to qualify reality. By reality here is meant merely the world of fact, the construction which is made from the basis of the waking body. But reality is more than this. Above the felt totality which underlies every individual experience, exists a multiciplicity of worlds more or less independent of each other, -realms of feeling, fact, profession, duty, etc. The world of ' fact' is but one of the worlds which make up the total of reality. The subject in any ideal qualification reality is reality, not in its totality, but in one of these special senses Every idea essentially qualifies some reality; it floats only with reference to a world in which it does not belong. The qualification need not be an explicit judgment, but a vague immediate coalescence with a more or less indefinite subject-reality, though reflection may always turn this relation into predication. Cases of alleged floating ideas exhibit on investigation the truth of their non-existence. Imaginary ideas are essentially created by exclusion from the actual. But the actual is not all reality. Repelled by the actual, an idea inheres in some other province of reality ; at least, in the vague residual totality of the Universe. The ideas existing in the imperative and interrogation qualify the real world of ideas. In hypo- thetical judgment, the actual fact is at once opposed to, and partly iden- 219</page><page sequence="2">220 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. tified with, the subject of the assertion; i. e., the sphere which functions as factual is assumed not to be the whole of reality. The idea repelled by negation from a subject inheres somehow in the realm of reality beyond that subject. Every idea is true of reality; the question is, how far, and in what sense. (II) The distinction between ' real ' and ' imaginary' is not that the former has certain external relations lacking to the latter; this is ultimately meaningless. The imaginary is created by exclusion from the real world of the normal waking self. But this real world rests on a felt content, a quality. Hence a real difference in content exists between the real and imaginary so conceived. But this ' real' is itself an arbitrary and inconsistent construction, depending on a felt quality merely. So vital a distinction as that between real and unreal must find a more secure basis in the internal character of the diverse worlds of reality. (III) Play is not essentially an activity concerned with the world of imagination, and earnest with that of real life. Play may be defined, in contrast with earnest, as any activity so far as it is agreeable, unconstrained by any end, and felt here and now not to matter. Any ordinarily serious activity may, under given circumstances, become play for a given individual. Nor is play without the characteristics of earnest. It is an essential aspect of life, and, as a general end, is in necessary relation to welfare. Though the details of play, unlike earnest, are unconstrained by the general character of its end, illusion is not essential to play. Moral restraint and the 'rules of the game' bring in an element of earnest. The distinction between play and earnest, as between real and imaginary, fact and idea, turns out to be relative, when reality is not identified with the actuality of our bodily world. This special real world in practice we often treat as illusory; but theoretically, we tend to set it up as real and fail, therefore, to do justice to other aspects of life. The world of reality is the world of values, and values are not judged abso- lutely but are measured by degrees. M. W. SPRAGUE. The Constitution of Thought. HUBERT FOSTON. Mind, No. 6o, pp. 486-503. The significance of an objective presentation lies in its mediating func- tion as the anticipatory sign of something else. The mediating importance of objects which are useful to the organism conditions the generalized forms of ideation characteristic of low mental life. Similarly, in higher intellec- tion, conscious abstraction of that aspect of an objective totality of qualities in which it is the sign of another, - abstraction controlled by reference to some ulterior significance as a goal of interest,- is the instrument for efficient dealing with objects. Significance, involving abstraction and potential generalization, is thus the nerve of the organic constitution of thought. But invariable realization of significances is matter not for thought, but for effective association. The function of thought is to assign the further conditions for particular significances when they are sometimes</page><page sequence="3">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 221 realized and sometimes not, the assumption being always that causation is a matter of conditional, not customary or unconditioned, succession. Handiwork and language are two means for developing the primitive ten- dency to regard things as having conditional significance. Both the arti- ficial product and the general name may be centers of various arrested possibilities of significance which stimulate effort to the determination of an available significance. Thought has essentially a practical reference. In the controlled abstraction of some significance, it implies expected reali- zation. In judgment, the copula asserts an equivalence of terms of variant suggestiveness in respect of some ulterior significance. The wide range of remotely possible practical issues involved in general propositions has led formal logic to neglect the practical reference. This reference is disguised in pure mathematics; yet Euclid may be read as the study of a condition- ing of voluntary movements to certain effects. Ancient and modern philoso- phy alike have failed to recognize conditional significance as the guiding principle in our experience. M. W. SPRAGUE. Psychofhysischer Parallelisnmus und ein bischen andere Erkenntnistheorie. E. BLEULER. Z. f. Psych. XLI, I, Pp. 15-27. It is the task of this article to criticise from an epistemological point of view some of the obscurities, contradictions, and various meanings of psychophysical parallelism. The term has three distinct meanings. (I) The first is Wundt's empirical parallelism. As a purely empirical theory, it is not very useful; it is not genuine parallelism, since the two series are not made co-extensive, and its conception of psychical causality gives rise to confusion. (II) According to the genuine and original parallelism which assumes two separate series, we can have no knowledge of the physical world. It is a mistake to equate the two series epistemologically. One is immediately certain and the other merely an unproved assumption, and we are landed in solipsism. Practical considerations, however, force us to presuppose a physical world. But if there are to be two series for us, they must interact, else we could never know the physical. The confusion lies in the use of the notion of reality, which we apply with two different mean- ings. Both series are real or not real, but in a different sense. The reality of the psychical world is immediate and absolute, but subjective; the reality of the physical world is hypothetical and relative, but it is objective. (III) Another quite different form of parallelism is that which regards the two series as different aspects of the same thing. Epistemologically this theory is at fault in assuming that the physical is given equally with the psychical. It is thus a monism and not a genuine parallelism, and the question of mutual influence is not pertinent. But the theory is on the whole logically sound, and in principle scientists have widely accepted it, It is not essential to the theory that every physical event should have its psychical accom- paniment. One argument in favor of such a panpsychism, -that con-</page><page sequence="4">222 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. sciousness could not have appeared at any given stage of development, -- is not logically compelling, since we really do not know that consciousness is something in principle quite different from the physical world. Further- more, it is mere anthropomorphism to assume that, because consciousness is all-important to man, there must also be a consciousness for the physical world. A. U. POPE. La logpque et la Philosothie contemjioraine. L. COUTURAT. Rev. de Met., XIV, 3, PP. 3I9-34I. Although logic has made great progress during the last fifty years, it is in general neither understood nor appreciated by contemporary philosophy. There are a number of current tendencies hostile to logic. The most widespread of these is ' psychologism,'- i. e., the pretense of psychology to deal adequately with every aspect of the spiritual life. Operating by means of the experimental method, it seeks to reduce logic to the psy- chology of intelligence. It regards all intellectual operations as merely states of consciousness, and attempts to find a complete explanation of truth and significance in the origin, development, and relations of con- scious states. But this standpoint entirely misconceives the relation be- tween logical and psychological laws. The former are concerned with truth and falsity; the latter ignore values and deal only with uniform sequences of phenomena. The incompetence of psychology in matters of logic is shown by its failure to establish a criterion of truth which is not barren and relative; and its entire misconception of the nature of logic by its recent endeavor to substitute for logic a so-called ' logic of feeling,' which is only a description of the affective basis of common fallacies. From this same standpoint, it has been objected that logic does not assist dis- covery. But this is not the business of logic any more than it is the busi- ness of poetics to inspire poetry. Furthermore, in so far as discovery or invention are successful, they unconsciously follow and conform to logical laws. Formal logic has another adversary in what may be termed ' sociol- ogism,' i. e., the pretension of sociology to replace and absorb philosophy. According to this view, the first principles of thought are merely those on which the whole world have agreed. Truth is merely a convention; it is not absolute, objective verity, but rather subjective belief. The fallacy of this theory is an extreme exaggeration of man's sociality. But social con- ventions such as language exist only as expressions for logically prior ideas. As Aristotle said, man has not reason because he is a social animal, but he is a social animal because he has reason. Another tendency indirectly hostile to logic is I moralism,' with its doctrine of the primacy of the practi- cal reason, making theoretical reason dependent upon morality. It begins by misunderstanding the nature of logic. By a misuse of the antinomies, it impugns the validity of reason and sets up in its place obligation, which is revealed by voluntary belief, something blind, arbitrary, and dogmatic. Furthermore, this voluntary belief is a fiction, since we believe what we</page><page sequence="5">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 223 can, and not what we wish. Finally moralism, by rejecting reason, under- mines the moral law, which has no value unless founded on reason. The final tendency antagonistic to logic is pragmatism, the doctrine which de- fines truth in terms of practical utility. It is the last avatar of empiricism, but with this difference that it necessarily results in subjectivism. Utility is also made the criterion of morality, and we have the uncritical glorification of power and success. Rational logic, which these tendencies oppose, cultivates sanity, precision, the instinct for truth, the critical spirit; and only in obedience to its laws can the mind attain any genuine freedom. A. U. POPE. L'echange econornzique et l'change affectif. F. PAULHAN. Rev. Ph., XXXI, IO, PP. 359-399. The personal relation enters into some transactions practically not at all, e. g., the making of a purchase through the medium of an automatic ma- chine. On the other hand, in some cases of exchange, it overshadows all other relations. Between these two extreme cases, the one of economic exchange, the other of sentimental, there is a continuous chain, varying according to circumstances, individuals, and moral conditions. In some cases, there is much sentimental exchange in connection with the economic. Again, there may be, between two parties, transactions in which only one kind of exchange is admitted, and others, between the same parties, where only the other kind takes place. One thing is notable here, - the very definite character of economic, the indefinite character of affective exchange, and the mixed character of exchanges where both of these enter in. On one side, the value is easily and simply appreciated, but the indefinite character of affective relations is noticeable throughout. A striking char- acteristic of the latter is that the transaction is not at once closed, but, in its very nature, reaches out to the future. It also shows a complexity, a variety not found in cases of economic exchange. In the former, the whole personality seems to be brought into play, while in the latter, this is dis- tinctly not the case. A closer examination would seem to force one to the conclusion that there is no truly gratuitous gift, but that all such cases may be resolved into illustrations of exchange. Even the apparently most disinterested services of a mother to her child are yet illustrations of ex- change; for the mother is performing a natural function, the performance of which her nature craves. The affective contract is then real, but vague. It is not, however, altogether indefinite, as is illustrated by the well- defined recognition of certain duties incumbent upon us as social beings. The specific character of the duty may be a question for debate, but that something is due is recognized. The affective exchange, as well as the economic, presupposes some appreciation of the value of the things ex- changed. The complications in the former case, however, are infinite, as great as in the measure of our desires. The actual evaluation made in affective exchange differs not always in kind from that made in the econ-</page><page sequence="6">224 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. mic, but rather in definiteness. It is harder to fix upon the actual value, since so much must be taken into account. There is often, too, a compli- cation of relations where the affective enters into the economic exchange. Illustrations of this are constantly seen in the economic world; old customers and friends are dealt with in a different way from the common crowd, etc. Our affective association with some economic exchanges is so strong that we tend to extend the feeling to the state of civilization under which they exist; homesickness, e. g., can often be analyzed into a strong desire for the supposed economic superiority of one's native place, and a distaste for the conditions which do not supply them. In more simple and primitive communities, the mixture of affective with economic exchange is much greater than in larger, more advanced states. Unquestionably there is a certain loss in the elimination of the personal element in business transac- tions; but along with this, there is a gain in the greater ease with which transactions are made, and the possibility of larger economic results from the labor employed. The contrast between the scope and character of the two relations is brought out by a consideration of the passage from one to the other and of the conditions which bring this forth. In the lives of in- dividuals, of communities, of states, organization and stability of condi- tions seems to go hand-in-hand with a preponderance of economic over affective relations; while periods of unrest, of upheaval, of revolution are characterized by a large increase of affective elements. Progress seems dependent upon alternations of these periods, for a preponderance of the one would lead to too great mechanism, of the other, to too great sentimen- tality. The passage from sentimental activity to economic activity seems to be one from altruism to egoism. But it is possible for both terms to lose significance in an exchange where what is beneficial to one is also bene- ficial to the other of the contracting parties; and this may be as true in economic as in affective exchange. So these two seemingly opposite rela- tions succeed each other normally and complete each other; and both are essential elements of progress. MATTIE ALEXANDER MARTIN. L' ' a f5riori' dans Za science. W. -M. KOZLOWSKI. Rev. Ph., XXXI, IO, PP. 400-4II. Science is born at the moment when man commences to make a purely theoretical employment of his knowledge. The world that science substi- tutes for immediate reality is composed of laws, of forces or energies, of atoms or masses. It is held by one school, of which Mach is the head, that the concepts and the theories of science are arbitrary and accidental. We agree with Mach in holding that the laws of nature are not found in things; but we hold that, far from being arbitrary and accidental, they are sub- jected, on the contrary, to a double necessity: that of our understanding, which determines the form of these principles, and that of the domain in which they are applied, which determines the choice of them. The idea</page><page sequence="7">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 225 that empirical knowledge cannot have a place without certain a priori principles serving as its base is very old. But the explication of the idea has, in many cases, taken the form of the doctrine of innate ideas, a doc- trine naturally meeting with antagonism from men of science. We can distinguish two kinds of a priori in science: (I) the historical a priori, in- troduced consciously and deliberately, forming the principles and scientific postulates; (2) the psychological a priori, produced unconsciously and involuntarily from our knowledge, introduced into the science under the form of these fundamental concepts. The problem of discovering the a priori in science is thus divided into two distinct fields: (I) the search for directing principles in scientific investigation; (2) the psychogenesis of scientific concepts. The process of science consists in erecting, a' girojfos of the observed reality, an ideal and purely rational edifice, towards which experience approaches more or less, and the end of which is to render ex- perience intelligible. The progress of science is a progress from naive intuitions to concepts. Its end is to multiply the equalities between the sensible and the rational aspects of the world. MATTIE ALEXANDER MARTIN. PSYCHOLOGY. The Nature of Conation and Mental Activity. G. F. STOUT. Br. J. Ps. II, I, PP. I-I5. Mental activity consists in interaction between subject as such and ob- ject as such, irrespective of the material efficiency of the conation. The specific character of conations in determining events may be described as the felt tendency toward change which arises when change is not merely thought but wanted. While Mr. Bradley is correct in ascribing com- plexity to conation, he fails to note as the distinctive feature of this com- plex the presence of a simple, unique, unanalyzable element. This unique component is an immediate experience, felt as pleasure and pain are felt. While never occurring in isolation at the introspective level, it may be conceived as the blind craving which persists as an essential relation to some- thing required for fulfilment, when we abstract completely from even the vaguest cognitions of an end to be attained. In place of this immediate experience, Mr. Bradley would substitute as the unique characteristic of the conative complex the identification of an idea with the self. This substi- tution is of doubtful value - not the idea of change, but the felt tendency toward it, constitutes the important factor in conation. Further, 'identi- fication with the self,' either in the broader or the narrower sense, is neither a distinctive nor an essential factor in conation. The self as an organized system, presupposes conation or interest, and hence cannot itself be consid- ered as the ultimate precondition of conation. The view which would identify the peculiar element of conation with motor sensation is likewise unten- able. No correspondence between the intensities of the two exists. The</page><page sequence="8">226 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. special connection of motor sensations with the conative experience is an irrelevant fact, due merely to their being the sense-experiences most im- mediately and uniformly resulting from our activity. The prevailing ten- dency among experimental psychologists is toward the rejection of cona- tion as a distinct process coordinate with sensation and affection. Cona- tion and affection may, indeed, be best described, not as two processes, but as distinguishable aspects of the same process. Yet it cannot be conceded that pain and pleasure, and desire or felt tendency, are not distinct and distinguishable modes of being conscious. The reasons why felt tendency has so largely eluded systematic introspection are various. The element of felt tendency cannot be detached from the conative com- plex; neither can it be superinduced on a synthesis of the elements yielded by the ordinary analysis of the experimental method. Hence it is inacces- sible to the psychology which relies on the building up of mind out of cer- tain recognized constituents, notably sensations. Further, the current laboratory assumption that mind is merely a sensation-complex is not only untenable from the point of view of epistemology and common sense, but, as an exaggerated form of subjective idealism which ignores all reference, either temporal or objective, it is doomed to failure in the investigation of a psychical experience which involves intrinsically a reference to an ' is to be,' as does conation. ELSIE MURRAY. On the Analysis of the Memory Consciousness: A Study in Mental Imagery and Memory of Meaningless Visual Forms. F. KUHLMANN. Psych. Rev., XIII, 5, pp. 3i6-348. An investigation of the memory consciousness by the method of direct introspection rather than by inference from psychophysical data is the general purpose of this study. The special object is to determine the nature of the imagery in the recall of a given material and the memory errors and their causes. The subject was required, at varying intervals, to recall and record by verbal description and drawing members from a group of meaningless visual forms exposed once. In recall the descriptions and associations consciously sought by the subject in the learning of the material were sometimes utilized as clues to the recovery or development of a figure, but in cases of a high degree of spontaneity of visual imagery were second- ary or lacking. Spontaneity varied with lapse of time, repetition of recall, and nature of the figure, reaching its highest limit in the case of the familiar geometric forms. The errors were traceable to three sources, ambiguous verbal description, associations, and a tendency to approximate a standard shape, position, and symmetry. In comparison with inferences from psy- chophysical data, the results in general indicate that the inherent spon- taneity of the imagery directly concerned in recall is of equal if not greater importance than are associations, and the weight of evidence is against the theory that all recall is mediated by some associative connection. The probable relation of spontaneity to repetition and its evident connection with</page><page sequence="9">No. 2.] S&amp;IMMARIFS OF ARTICLES. 227 the internal organization of the material indicate that the inference from objective data, that the greater ease of recall in complex figures depends on the number and closeness of the associative connections, is only a half- truth. The complex material is at the same time that which has been the most frequently in consciousness. Spontaneity of imagery may be taken as an expression of mental economy. The gradual elimination of associations as aids to recall, or memory sanctions, which takes place with repetition of recall, is a further instance of such economy, culminating in the immediate drawing of the figure without recourse even to the visual image. A similiar tendency is reflected in the direction of error, which tends to substitute an easier memory image, i. e., one of greater spontaneity, for the correct one. The naive conception of the memory consciousness as a weakened copy of the original perception, with a recognition factor added, is controverted by these results. The process of recall is not a weakened repetition of the process of learning, but one widely diverse. Moreover, the recognitive element is not a mere addendum, but a vital factor in the rejection and acceptance of details throughout recall, and is further accompanied by an emotional reaction corresponding to expected ease or difficulty of recall. Recall is very largely not recall or reproduction at all, but the construction of a certain result which is accepted in place of the original. ELSIE MURRAY. Contre l'Zintellectualisme en fsyclologie. G. L. DUPRAT. Rev. Ph., XXXI, 7, pp. 53-63. Intellectualism in psychology has its origin in the belief that man shares to some extent in the essentially divine power of cognition. The present reaction against metaphysics and theology should lead to a criticism of this position. Even pragmatism, as seen in W. James, is still faithful through- out to the old Kantian view. Our view is that a scientific psychology should seek for the origin of our intellectual activity in the exigencies of vital activity, should look behind human thought to the time when it did not exist. If we are not then allowed a world of time, space, causality, etc., we will conceive of subjects simply feeling and moving, entirely devoid of any knowledge of phenomena. We claim for such inferior beings only the activities of attraction and repulsion, along with certain tendencies toward expansion and contraction in the presence of light and dark, such as are seen even in plant life. These feelings and these ten- dencies are in some way connected. Beginning with no more than this, we can then trace the psychological development of man. The intellect- ualist may object that desire implies an end, but in fact it is nothing but habit induced by preceding activity. In the same way, sensation is merely a passing mode of mental activity. Adaptation is the result of opposing desires gradually conciliated, and tends toward the total activity of a living being. Through imagination and the principle of causality, we pass from sensation to the idea of an object. Space, quantity, position, succession,</page><page sequence="10">228 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW.

L'attention sjhontane' dans la vie ordinaire et ses aj jlications fratiques. ROERICH. Rev. Ph., XXXI, 8, pp. I36-I60. Spontaneous attention has two aspects, primitive and apperceptive. Primitive attention is the effort by which we seek to know an object which has produced on our senses a vivid impression. It interprets the exciting object in terms of sense impressions, automatically and without recourse to discursive reasoning. For primitive attention we have three laws: (i) The more attention the shorter the reaction time. (2) Attention cannot re- main fixed on any object more than several seconds at a time. (3) A definite duration of time is necessary for the appreciation of a change in stimuli. For the practical application of primitive attention there are five rules: (i) To arouse and hold it, impressions must progressively increase in inten- sity or vivacity. (2) A time of definite duration must elapse between repeated impressions. (3) The object of attention must be clearly defined. (4) Impressions different in nature can be associated when referring to the same object. (5) Contrast increases the strength of impressions. Atten- tion by apperception is a form of spontaneous attention aroused by a new impression or idea among previously acquired impressions or ideas. It has one law and four practical rules. In every act of cognition which is not directed by the will, the exactitude and rapidity of cognition is in proportion to the extent and variety of previously acquired ideas associated with it, and to the degree of system in their coordination. The rules are as follows: (i) To excite apperceptive attention, the exciting idea must appear novel, though it need not be so. (2) The exciting idea must be similar to, but not identical with, the previously acquired ideas. (3) The new idea must be bound to the old ideas. (4) There must be a pause between two culminat- ing points of attention. C. WEST. Comment Zes f5assions finissent. TH. RIBOT. Rev. Ph., XXXI, 6, pp. 6 I 9-644. Passion seems always to be slowly formed, generally before its appear- ance in consciousness. But its formation follows the law of summation, moving more rapidly as it proceeds. The appearance of the dominating idea marks the moment when the passion is constituted as such; a sud- den revelation of an unconscious work. A passion which has not passed through a period of incubation has a precarious existence. Passions end in various ways, which may be put in five classes: exhaustion or habit, transformation, substitution, insanity, death. The probability of extinction of a passion is in direct proportion to the quantity of its emotional, as op- posed to its intellectual, elements. Static inhibitory passions are more stable than dynamic passions: the more active a being, the more causes</page><page sequence="11">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 229 of destruction it meets. But passion cannot live by mere inertia or habit. There must be in it a desire for life and dominance. Physical feebleness, sickness, age, and chagrin drain the energy needed by passion. For pas- sion is the result of the total energy, a condensation of personality. In true passion, whose life is ever renewed, habit plays no part. But the ten- dency of the affect of routine on passion is to reduce its activity. The transformation of one passion into a kindred passion is not its extinction. Such a phenomenon may be caused by a surplus of energy needing ex- pression and by the delayed appearance of the ruling idea. The trans- formation may be the effect of exterior influences or of latent tendencies, but the initial passion is the same under another masque. Where it changes to its opposite, the dominant idea remains; there is but an inver- sion of value. The substitution or total replacement of a passion is very rare. The appearance of substitution is given by the successive dominance of coexisting passionate tendencies. In the case of passions which end in insanity, it is pertinent to ask if passion is pathological. In some ways passion is like insanity, but the fixed idea necessary to passion is not found in insanity. Passion is conscious of itself as such; insanity is not. Still there is no specific characteristic by which they may always be distin- guished. Passion is certainly a rupture in normal life, characterized by polarization of consciousness. It approximates insanity when it does not end in it. By its intrinsic nature passion marches consciously towards death. A man is his passion; therefore the instincts of self-preservation and of passion are identified when a man meets death for his passion. C. WEST. ETHICS AND A3STHETICS. La sociologie abstraife et ses divisions. ADRIEN NAVILLE. Rev. Ph., XXXI, 5, PP. 457-47I. The aim of this article is to show that sociology is a science. Sociology is defined as the science which seeks the natural laws of the relations ex- isting between men. The divisions of the science must be based on the diversity of these kinds of interrelations. Economics is not to be con- sidered a social science, or, at least, not a part of sociology. The human interrelations with which sociology is concerned are the voluntary relations. All of these relations may be referred to six chief groups: Co-operation, exchange, donation (benevolence), spoliation, authority (command and obedience), and systems of signs and language. Each of the parts of sociology will be the science of the natural laws of one of these groups of relations. To illustrate the division of the science several questions are formulated and referred to their proper groups. Each of these divisions of sociology seeks to analyze the different kinds of relations, and their causes, duration, modifications, and suppression. General sociology makes a synthesis of the results obtained by analysis. General laws which shall afford answers to sociological questions are the object of abstract sociology.</page><page sequence="12">230 TIE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. The founding of such a science is not impossible, although it is a remote ideal. FRANK B. CRANDALL. La critique dart. PAUL GAULTIER. Rev. de Ph., VI, IO, PP. 344-358. A work of art, itself the expression of aesthetic emotion, cannot be made subject to a purely intellectual criticism. Reason of itself cannot estimate beauty, cannot lay down for it any fixed laws. The time is long past when the fine arts were confined to certain orthodox subjects presented according to determined rules. For us the one virtue of a work of art is the aesthetic emotion to which it gives rise. We cannot accept as a criterion its moral value, its social virtues, or the skill of its execution. None of these is after all its raison d'etre. Nor does art include the study of geography, history, ethics, etc. These teach us to understand, but art is essentially emotional. In any concrete form, it is true, the work of art has certain characteristics apart from its beauty. Reason of itself, without complete artistic apprecia- tion, still recognizes harmony, unity, and likeness to nature. Intellect demands these fundamental qualities; it may speak also of the subject, the style, and the coloring. Feeling, on the other hand, though different for different individuals, is the natural possession of us all. Dutch art we feel is cold, while Italian is all emotion. Some works impress us vividly, others haunt our memory, others are quickly forgotten; we judge of them accordingly. Next to feeling comes execution; the work must recall what we have already seen or heard. A work full of thought, too, has a corresponding value, as in the majesty of Christian art. But in the end, it is the personality of the critic which determines his criticism. He must give himself up to the power of the artist, and judge of the result. The true critic, though guided by his intellectual discrimination, is determined at last by his sensitiveness to all the influences of feeling. MARGARET K. STRONG. Qu'est ce que l'art f P. GAULTIER. Rev. Ph., XXXI, 9, pp. 225-259. What is the distinguishing mark of the work of art? Does it conform approximately to an ideal model or does it imitate nature ? Is it nothing but a combination of pleasing sensations ? To answer these questions satis- factorily, we must approach art not from a standpoint of superficial objec- tivity or of individualistic subjectivity, but from that of feeling. Unlike the sciences of mechanism, thought, or conduct, the fine arts do not satisfy any needs of our organism. Though utility and art may unite in one object, they are distinctly independent. So also of truth and art: the realm of art is imagination, not understanding. Nor is the object of the fine arts the morally good.
