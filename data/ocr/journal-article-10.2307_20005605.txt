INTRODUCTION Among all the different religious movements in contemporary Japan one must acknowledge that from the point of view of the number of members, financial assets, physical facilities and activities, the most dominant are those that arose in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and are referred to collectively as 'newly arisen religions' (Shinko Shiikyo) . Various observers have offered their explanations for the success and popularity of these groups in religious, sociological, psychological and historical terms.' Several of these groups fall into the category of millenarian and messianic movements and have been discussed by Professor Carmen Blacker in her essay, 'Millenarian Aspects of the New Religions in Japan' .2 Why and how do millenarian and messianic movements remain popular and maintain their vitality even when the circumstances surrounding their founding change? How do they continue their dynamic growth after the messiah dies or when the millennium is delayed? What are the similarities and differences between these groups in Japan and those in other cultural areas? While acknowledging my own debt to Professor Blacker's essay, I would like to expand on her work in two directions. First, I want to focus in more detail on one of the groups she dealt with, World Messianity (Japanese, Sekai kyfisei kyo).3 Second, I will examine World Messianity in the light of Professor Victor Turner's concepts of liminality and communitas.4 I believe 1 See the following studies of the new Religions: H. Neill McFarland, The Rush Hour of the Gods (New York: Macmillan, I967); C. B. Offner and H. Van Straelen, Modern Japanese Religions (New York: Twayne, I963); and Harry Thomsen, The New Religions of japan (Rutland, Vt: Tuttle, I963). H. Byron Earhart, The Religions of japan (Tokyo: Sophia University, 1970) contains an exhaustive bibliography on the main New Religions including World Messianity (see page 68). 2 This essay is found in Donald H. Shively (ed.), Tradition and Modernization in Japanese Culture (Princeton University Press, 1971), pp. 563-600 (hereinafter referred to as Tradition and Modern ization). 3 See Tradition and Modernization, pp. 58o-i, 586-7. 4 Of Professor Turner's works the following are the most pertinent for his views on liminality and communitas: The Forest of Symbols (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, I967), pp. 93-I I I (hereinafter referred to as Forest); The Ritual Process (Chicago: Aldine Publishing Co., I969), pp. 94-I65 (here inafter referred to as Ritual); and Dramas, Fields and Metaphors (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1974), pp. 231-99 (hereinafter referred to as Dramas).

Attention is also called to a recent study of a utopian community in Japan, Ittoen, in which Turner's concept of liminality is employed. Winston Davis, 'Ittoen: the myths and rituals of Liminality', History of Religions, xiv (May 1975), 282-321; xv (August I975), 1-33. 0034-4125/79/2828-2820 $01.50 ? I979 Cambridge University Press</page><page sequence="2">540 CHARLES H. HAMBRICK that the use of these two models will enable us to answer the questions posed above and will lead us to a deeper understanding of millenarianism and messianism in general and of World Messianity as one Japanese manifesta tion of the phenomenon. II. LIMINALITY AND COMMUNITAS Professor Turner derives his concept of liminality from Van Gennep's three stages of rites of passage: 'separation, margin (or limen, signifying " threshold " in Latin), and aggregation'.' The classic example of this process is found in tribal initiation in which the ritual subject moves from the comfortable state of childhood through various rites of transition into the state of adulthood. Turner draws an important distinction between 'state' and 'transition' and their synonyms: structure and anti-structure. State refers to 'any type of stable or recurrent condition that is culturally recognized'. In contrast, transition is 'a process, a becoming, a transformation', and it has 'different cultural properties from those of a state '.2 Communitas is Turner's name for the distinctive type of community that emerges in the liminal period and is a relatively unstructured and undifferen tiated communion or fellowship. This is in contrast to society with its 'struc tured, differentiated, and often hierarchical system of politico-legal economic positions... '.3 In spite of the pejorative ring to the term Turner sees anti-structure in a very positive and creative light. From one point of view anti-structure would imply chaos and would 'result in anomie, angst, and the fragmentation of society into a mass of anxious and disoriented individuals... '.4 However, Turner equates anti-structure with communitas and hence sees it as presenting the possibility of freedom, spontaneity and creativity and finally as a condition necessary to the continued health of the social order itself. It is not a question of either structure or anti-structure, but both in a dialectical relationship are necessary to any vital social order. Out of the social order communitas emerges emphasizing human aspirations that are smothered by an excessively rigid structure. Then communitas becomes more structured and moves back into the social order to fructify it. Such dialectical interplay between structure and anti-structure is evidence of creative vitality, not divisive inertia. Communitas occurs in three forms according to Turner: (i) existential or spontaneous, (2) normative, and (3) ideological. The first is a truly structure less 'happening', charismatic and inward, prior to any necessity of social organization. This is the form that might be referred to as the 'typical' manifestation of communitas. The second and third types represent a 'fall' 1 Ritual, p. 94. 3 Ritual, p. 96. 2 Forest, p. 94. 4 Dramas, p. 250.</page><page sequence="3">WORLD MESSIANITY 541 from spontaneous anti-structure into the domain of structure and law. Since no group can long endure without some form of social organization, insti tutions, or social control, the spontaneous must give way to the normative. 'Normative communitas: the attempt to capture and preserve spontaneous communitas in a system of ethical precepts and legal rules." The third, ideological communitas, is 'the formulation of remembered attributes of the communitas experience in the form of a utopian blueprint for the reform of society '.2 The complete absence of structure is characteristic of the first type and that only in its earliest stages. As existential communitas moves into normative communitas to develop its own unique social organization which has a perduring quality, or as Turner says, 'transition has here become a perma nent condition '.3 One of the main religious characteristics of liminality and communitas is its sacred potency caused, at least partially, by the liminars who are con sidered 'set apart' (one meaning of 'sacred') from the usual societal structures. Turner writes, 'Communitas breaks in through the interstices of structure, in liminality; at the edges of structure, in marginality; and from beneath structure, in inferiority. It is almost everywhere held to be sacred or "holy", possibly because it transgresses or dissolves the norms that govern structured and institutionalized relationships and is accompanied by expe riences of unprecedented potency.'4 Among those liminars who are set apart are charismatic persons such as artists, prophets and, of course, 'messiahs'. These spiritual leaders 'tend to be liminal or marginal people, " edgemen", who strive with a passionate sincerity to rid themselves of the cliches associated with status incumbency and role-playing and enter into vital relations with other men in fact or imagination. In their productions we may catch glimpses of that unused evolutionary potential in mankind which has not yet been externalized and fixed in structure.'5 Thus liminality and communitas often provide the creative thrust of a culture as embodied in myths, rituals, symbols, philo sophical systems, and works of art. In viewing liminality and communitas in a historical context Turner notes that movements with labels such as millenarian, messianic, separatist, nativistic and revitalistic often reflect the main characteristics of liminality and communitas. Leaders of radical millenarian movements like cargo cults encourage their followers to get rid of all signs of the old age that is soon to be destroyed and to prepare or wait for the coming of the new age. This period of waiting is analogous to the process of transition that Turner calls liminality. Not only do the liminars form communitas while they await the birth of the 1 Image, p. 252. 4 Ibid. p. 128. 2 Ibid. 5 Ibid. 3 Ritual, p. I07.</page><page sequence="4">542 CHARLES H. HAMBRICK millennium, but the expected paradise or utopia is often symbolized in images characteristic of communitas.1 Finally, Turner wishes to move beyond the commonly accepted limitation of 'social' to 'social structural' and to insist that the dynamics of a culture cannot be adequately understood if one does not see transition as well as states, anti-structure as well as structure. Therefore, he focuses specifically on: (i) liminality, the process of transition from one state to another; (2) liminars, the distinctive transitional or liminal persons; and (3) communitas, the unique quality of community formed by liminars. III. WORLD MESSIANITY In this section I will not attempt an exhaustive treatment of World Messianity, but I will focus on two characteristics of it: (i) its philosophy of history or two-ages theory, and (2) its self-understanding as a messianic community. However, before we move into our discussion of these two points it may help to give a brief introduction to the group itself.2 World messianity is one of the more prominentJapanese new religions and was founded in 1935 by a merchant named Okada Mokichi (surname first), now known as Meishu-sama (enlightened spiritual leader) who was born in i882 and died in I955. After a short and illustrious, although troubled, career as a businessman he began having spiritual revelations in I926, and on I 5 June I 93 I it was revealed to him that the end of this age was approach ing and the birth of a new age was imminent (see p. 545 below). He believed that he was the one chosen to prepare the world for the coming of the new age and as one facet of that preparation he organized this movement. Just before and during World War II his work was greatly curtailed because of government restrictions. After the war, however, the movement received new vitality, membership increased rapidly, activities such as spiritual healing and nature farming were resumed and two model paradises were constructed. After Meishu-sama's death the leadership passed to his wife, Nidai-sama (Second Spiritual Leader), and after her demise in I962 to their third daughter who is known as Kyoshu-sama or Spiritual Leader. World Messianity claims about 750,000 members in churches throughoutJapan and in several foreign countries. 1 See Ritual, pp. I06-7, I I I-12. 2 My discussion of World Messianity is based primarily on personal visists to the centres in Atami in I965 and to Atami, Hakone and Kyoto in I978 and conversations with leaders there; also personal correspondence with a member of the Translastion Division in Los Angeles.</page><page sequence="5">WORLD MESSIANITY 543 IV. WORLD MESSIANITY S VIEW OF TIME World Messianity teaches that the movement of time is divided into two ages: the age of night or darkness and the age of light. Likewise, all reality is divided into two realms: the physical or material and the spiritual. Human beings themselves are also composed of physical and spiritual dimensions. The unseen spiritual realm is primary and is the world of cause while the material world is its reflection and is the world of effect. Events occur first in the spiritual realm and then are reflected in the physical world. Even though God's creation was originally perfect, at some point in time the age of night set in. When, how or why this 'fall' occurred is nowhere discussed in detail, but it is clear that the cause of the age of night was violation of God's laws of creation by human beings. However, World Messianity avoids a radical dualism of the two ages and affirms that even the age of night is a part of God's overall providential plan. 'All events in the world have been part of God's Great Plan, in which light and darkness, good and evil have clashed, and beauty and ugliness have coexisted as necessary processes of evolvement toward the ideal world. God's profound Providence, impossible for the human mind to understand in its entirety, is in all these things." God has allowed the physical realm to predominate up to now so that a scientific technological civilization could be built up. However, people have now become so engrossed in the activities of the material world that they have neglected the spiritual side of reality. Because of this a one-sided civilization has developed, rich in things but poor in spirit, in which the physical almost completely obliterates the spiritual. In the face of such an imbalance God now wills that the old age of night end and that a new age of spiritual light shine forth. One of the primary characteristics of the age of night is the presence of clouds. The spiritual realm was originally clear and pure, but because of man's self-centred thoughts, words and actions, clouds were formed which are the cause of physical, mental and spiritual sickness and social disorders such as poverty, injustice, crime and war. During the long age of night both the physical and spiritual realms were enveloped in dark clouds, but the change from the old to the new ages which began in the spiritual realm is now beginning to be reflected in the physical world. In the age of light, which is now dawning, the spiritual clouds will be purified and sickness, poverty and conflict will gradually disappear. In Turner's terms the past age of night can be viewed as a pre-liminal state, the future complete realization of the age of light as a post-liminal state, and the present as a time of transition (liminal process) between the two states. The two states are not the central focus of interest reflected in the writings of 1 Teachings of Meishu-sama, vol. 2, p. 36 (hereinafter referred to as Teachings).</page><page sequence="6">544 CHARLES H. HAMBRICK World Messianity, but it is precisely the present as a transitional period that is of greatest existential import. The present is not identified with either the old age or the new age and yet it overlaps with and participates in both. In a recent conversation with a member of World Messianity in Japan it was explained to me that the period beginning in I93I is like the dawn or twi light. It is no longer the night for the light has begun to drive away the darkness, but neither is it the day in its full splendour. It is analogous to that time of the day that is both night and day and yet is neither. It is this 'betwixt and between' character that gives the present its unique flavour in World Messianity. The members of World Messianity as liminars participate in the old age in that sickness, poverty and war are still a condition of their existence, but at the same time they proleptically anticipate the new age as a foretaste of blessings to come. Not only do they know that the new age is coming, but they also participate in it to a limited degree now. For example, they can join World Messianity, hear the teachings of Meishu-sama, visit the sacred grounds, and become purified through the practice of Johrei. The self-understanding of both Meishu-sama and World Messianity revolve around their unique roles in the present changeover process. The transition is a gradual one in which Meishu-sama's life and the founding of World Messianity stand as central salvific events. The present is the 'fullness of time' in which God has acted to bring about the destruction of the old structure and the establishment of a new order. Meishu-sama is the messiah, World Messianity is the communitas, Johrei is the sacred power, and the sacred grounds are the paradigmatic beauty centres that God has provided to enable human beings to pass successfully through this period of transition. World messianity shows little interest in the history of the past age of night and any descriptions they give of it sound very contemporary. For example, some of the more salient evils of the age of night are 'the nuclear arms race, ideological conflicts, food contamination, air pollution and other environ mental hazards, the growing sicknesses, and the educational and moral problems'.' Its concern is centred precisely on the present as the crucial transition from the old age to the new age. What does World messianity mean by the 'present' in chronological terms? Meishu-sama taught that I88I was a crucial date in the changeover from the old age to the new although the particular significance of that date remains a mystery.2 In the I926 revelations mentioned above Meishu-sama felt himself being called and prepared for some momentous mission. Then 1 Sounds of the Dawn, vol. I, p. I68 (hereinafter referred to as Sounds). 2 Teachings, vol. I, pp. 37-8. In a letter dated I8 July I974 the Rev. Ky6ko Higuchi of the translations division of World Messianity in Los Angeles wrote the following response to my question concerning the events of I88i referred to by Meishu-sama. 'Meishu-sama did not tell us anything about the year i88I, beyond mentioning it in his article (vol. I, p. 37), so we do not know if he referred to some specific event or simply to the beginning point of the changeover.'</page><page sequence="7">WORLD MESSIANITY 545 finally in 193I it was revealed to him and some of his followers that the new age had actually dawned. Nidai-sama recalls the occasion. One day in 193 1, when we were living in Omori, Meishu-sama received a spiritual directive to go to the Nihonji Buddhist Temple in Chiba Prefecture. So, on June I4th, we took a train from Ryogoku to Hota with a group of twenty-six followers. That night we reached the Nihonji Temple, about one-fourth of the way up Mt. Nokogiri ... We had a short rest, then rose at three o'clock and prepared to climb to the top of the mountain. As it was still dark, we all carried lanterns. When we were about halfway up, the first gray light of dawn began to appear, but it was so foggy we could not see a thing and more or less groped our way to the top. We reached the summit and waited. It was some time before the sun rose, beaming through the mist. As the fog cleared, we had a bird's-eye view of the Kanto plains ... The grandeur of the view was far beyond description; it seemed we were in a celestial sphere. All of us voiced the delight welling up from the depths of our hearts. Following Meishu-sama's lead, we chanted our prayer, the Amatsu Norito. In that exalted vibration, God told Meishu-sama that that exact moment was the dawning of the New Age.' Meishu-sama composed a poem in honour of the momentous events of that day. The auspicious day of June fifteenth, 'thirty-one', Marked the opening, Solemnly and quietly, of Celestial Rock Cave Gate.2 Just as little is written specifically about the past before i88i so the literature contains few prophetic references to a far-distant eschatological event. Instead, the dawning of the new age is now in process and as Meishu sama wrote, the signs indicate that the fulfilment of God's plan lies close at hand. 'No one can say when the old cycle of the Age of Darkness will be completely ended, giving an exact date, nor can anyone say when the Age of Light will have become totally established. There are many signs, however, that it will be in the not-too-distant future.'3 As in most eschatological schemes the end is imminent and therefore the transition period is fore-i shortened. However, as the end is delayed the transition period is extended and, as Turner suggests, transition becomes a permanent condition. 1 Reminiscences about Meishu-sama, vol. I, pp. 26-7. 'The Dawning of the new age' does not mean that the old age has passed completely and that the new age has fully arrived. It means that the new age has started in this time and place but its completion lies in the future. 2 Sounds, vol. I, p. 41. The 'Celestial Rock Cave Gate' refers to the story in book i, chapter I 7 of the Kojiki in which Amaterasu Omikami, the Sun Goddess, had hidden herself in a cave, thus de priving the world of sunlight. To remedy this crisis the other kami lured her out of the cave so that once again the world was warm and bright. Meishu-sama here suggests that in a similar way God is now sending his spiritual light into a world of cloudy darkness and inaugurating a new age of light. 3 Teachings, vol. I, p. 36.</page><page sequence="8">546 CHARLES H. HAMBRICK V. WORLD MESSIANITY AS COMMUNITAS Now let us turn to World Messianity as a messianic community showing especially its sacred potency and paradigmatic character. Specifically we will focus on Johrei as the power making possible spiritual healing through purification and on the model paradises as paradigms for the establishment of a new world of artistic beauty. During the early days of Meishu-sama's revelations he felt himself to be the channel for a strange power that enabled him to heal persons of various physical and mental afflictions. This later came to be called Johrei and was without question one of the central foci of Meishu-sama's own ministry and is one of the most ubiquitous features and chief identifying marks of World Messianity today. 'Johrei is the basic activity of the Church of World Messianity, because it is the most vital part of the Divine Light Program. The channeling of the Divine Light purifies and thus raises the world's spiritual vibrations, so Johrei is the most important factor in the establish ment of paradise on earth.'" What is Johrei? The most common definition of the word in the literature of World Messianity is 'the purifying of the spiritual body by the Divine Light of God'.2 God is believed to be the creator and sustainer of all things through his divine energy symbolized most often as light. He is thought of as cosmic power rather than as an anthropomorphic deity; attention is focused more on his dynamic activity than on some abstract notion of his being. Meishu-sama writes, 'Needless to say, all activity in the universe is generated by Divine Energy, the Power of God. The birth, growth and perpetual change of all things are controlled by His Power. It is this Energy that makes every thing move and also brings it to a standstill. Human beings, animals, plants, even minerals, come into existence through it and perish through the same energy. In short, it is God's Power that is the absolute ruler of the universe, His Divine Energy which controls it.'3 God's three main characteristics, power, wisdom and love, are symbolized as light. Wisdom comes through its enlightening illumination, love through its heat and warmth, and energy through its vibrations. However, far and away the strongest emphasis is on the vibratory energy of God's light. As we have already seen, one of the marks of the old age is the presence of contaminating clouds which have obstructed God's light and power. Johrei is the manifestation of the power and energy of God's light in this time of transition to dispel all impurities caused by those clouds. As Meishu-sama wrote, All impurities Man has accumulated 1 Sounds, p. 206. 2 Teachings, vol. I, p. 5. 3 Sounds, vol. I, p. 100.</page><page sequence="9">WORLD MESSIANITY 547 During the Dark Age Are now to be burned away By God's spiritual fire.' As suggested by the image of fire in the previous poem, the process of purification will be a terrifying and painful experience, especially to those whose cloud covering is thick and heavy. The purification will actually be experienced on both a cosmic and personal plane. On a cosmic level it will be like a cataclysm similar to descriptions of the ends of the world (age) in Jewish and Christian apocalyptic and in Hindu and Buddhist Kalpa theories. The image of birth travail shows that only through pain and suffering (of purification) can a new age be born. We might liken the personal experience of purification to that of one whose eyes are unaccustomed to the light through long years of living in darkness and then facing the sun as it bursts forth at noon. When the new age comes all creation must undergo purification, and World Messianity sees itself as performing a unique role in this part of God's plan. Since the purification will be a traumatic experience, God in his wisdom and compassion uses World Messianity during this transition period to undertake the gradual process of cleansing through its various activities, especiallyJohrei, so that the final cataclysmic cleansing will be less severe. Those who have already undergone purification through participation in the activities of the World Messianity can actually look forward to the final purification with joy. Meishu-sama wrote, 'Individuals who have accumu lated too many clouds on the spiritual body or have too many toxins in the physical body will not be able to endure the power of the Light. The Last Judgment will indeed be terrible for these, but others can anticipate its completion with joy.'2 The transition period will be a time of preparation for the full arrival of the new age. Turner's suggestion that spiritual power is characteristic of liminality and communitas can be clearly seen in the practice of Johrei. With the initial revelations to Meishu-sama came the power to heal through the cleansing effect of the vibrations of God's divine light. This power has been the central identifying mark not only of the messiah himself but of the messianic com munity as well. Every time Johrei is performed - at a small Johrei centre between two persons or at the mass meetings where Ky5shu-sama performs it - they have the exercise of that sacred power and the foretaste of paradise on earth. The note upon which the previous section ended, 'paradise on earth', leads us naturally to a consideration of the sacred grounds (seichi). These model paradises are located at Hakone and Atami with a third one being developed 1 Ibid. vol. I, p. 43. 2 Teachings, vol. I, p. 41.</page><page sequence="10">548 CHARLES H. HAMBRICK in Kyoto. These centres are intended to be small models in this transition time of what the whole world will become in the new age. The great Plan of God For Paradise on our earth Must begin somewhere, Must have a small prototype In the material world.' In his dedication speech at the Hakone centre in I952 Meishu-sama said, 'With the completion of Shinsen-kyo the first miniature paradise has been created and a prototype established. Its influence will spread slowly but steadily; when the time arrives that its spiritual vibration has permeated the entire world, paradise on this earth will become a reality.'2 It is important to note that paradise is to be located in this world. It is not in some transcendent realm nor is it pushed into a far-distant future. It is even now being con structed beginning with very real and tangible models in Japan. 'God's loving Plan is to establish a paradise in which all His children will enjoy true happiness and peace while they are still on earth' (emphasis mine).3 Paradise is not only a place but a life style that is characteristic of new age existence. The positive attributes are best summed up in the motto, 'The establishment of paradise on earth, in which truth, virtue, and beauty abound - resulting in health, prosperity, and peace.'4 One would hesitate to rank truth, virtue and beauty in any order of importance in paradise, but in reading the literature of the movement one cannot help but feel that beauty will play a unique role in the new age. In fact, Meishu-sama writes concerning certain ascetics who have made a virtue of depriving themselves, 'Beauty, the most important element, is neglected; and a life of truth and virtue without beauty is incomplete.'5 Creating beauty is one of the noblest of human capacities and artists truly participate in God's creative power. But to enjoy and appreciate beauty of any kind, with or without sophisticated critical eyes, is itself a form of 'beauty creation' within one's own mind. World Messianity emphasizes art for everyone, even those who are uncultured according to the standards of this world. Members are urged to realize that the highest form of beauty is to 1 Prayers and Gosanka, p. I8. 2 A Guide to the Sacred Grounds, p. 8. 3 Sounds, vol. I, p. 222. Professor Blacker suggests that one of the ways Japanese millenarianism is different from that found in other cultures is that here paradise is identified with the 'image' of the modern world rather than with a transcendent utopia. It is 'this-worldly', not 'other-worldly', present-oriented rather than looking to either the distant past or future for fulfilment. She also notes thatJapanese messianism tends to be active rather than passive. Believers are exhorted to work out their own salvation and to become actively involved in bringing in the 'kingdom' rather than passively awaiting the advent of the new age. These two characteristics certainly apply to World Messianity. See Traditions and Modernization, pp. 596-600. 4 World Messianity and What it Means, p. 8. T Teachings, vol. I, p. 73.</page><page sequence="11">WORLD MESSIANITY 549 be found within the hearts and minds of human beings as the apex of God's creation. Meishu-sama practically equates art with perfection as he speaks of the ideal life as the artistic life, that is, an abundant, healthy and prosperous life. One of the unique and most significant beliefs about beauty in World Messianity is that it is viewed as energy or power rather than a mere aesthetic experience. We have already seen that beauty is one of the means of spiritual purification by its vibratory power. Meishu-sama writes, 'For many years I prayed that I would be able to build a museum where everyone could come and be blessed by the high vibration of true art." Nidai-sama adds, 'He [one] can be purified spiritually by coming in contact with art of high spiritual vibration.'2 Turner's recognition of the integral connection between liminality and artistic creativity can also be seen exemplified by both Meishu-sama and World Messianity. Meishu-sama, although not a great artist, did appreciate art to the extent that he studied and collected art works and was considered to have an unusual knowledge of art for an amateur. He also built an art museum in order to make these works available to the public at large. He himself was artistic in a more popular sense, composing numerous waka (five line Japanese poems), drawing pictures of the popular Bodhisattva, Kannon, and practising calligraphy, flower arranging and the tea ceremony. In I 9 72 the Kado Sangetsu Flower Arranging School based on Meishu-sama's unique style was formally established by World Messianity. The sacred grounds were designed primarily by Meishu-sama, including the plans of the buildings and the layout of the gardens. From Meishu-sama's love of art World Messianity has inherited its emphasis on the creative, even healing, power of artistic beauty. The expansion of the art museums and the continuing emphasis on the natural and man-made beauty of the paradises give evidence of the centrality of art and beauty during this transition period.3 In what sense can World Messianity be understood as a form of existential, normative, and ideological communitas? I do not see that World Messianity ever in its history existed as a pure form of existential communitas. Perhaps the period from the beginning of Meishu-sama's revelations in I926, in cluding his entering full-time religious work in I928, up to his vision in I93I, can be considered a time when the few workers and followers could be thought of as existential communitas. There was a minimum of structure and 1 Ibid. vol. 2, p. 54. 2 Teachings of Nidai-sama, vol. 2, p. 54. 3 Gerardus van der Leeuw, Sacred and Profane Beauty (Nashville: Abingdon Press, I963) also emphasizes the power of religious art. Other Japanese religions emphasize art, especially Omoto, Seicho no je, and PL Kyadan. I think that World Messianity's genius lies in its unique combination of God's light and power, Johrei, and artistic beauty. A splendid new art museum is now under construction on the summit of a mountain overlooking Atami. It is scheduled for a 1982 dedication and when completed will be one of the outstanding private museums in Japan.</page><page sequence="12">550 CHARLES H. HAMBRICK the activities were actually the personal projects of Meishu-sama writ large. The distinctive two-age view of time was already offering its messianic colouring to the developing character of the movement. However, it must be noted that during the period from the mid I920S to I934 Meishu-sama was a member of another of the new religions, Omoto-kyo, which, although mil lenarian and messianic, was nevertheless a rather highly structured and organized group. He actually became one of the leaders in Omoto-ky6, but soon after leaving it he established his own group in I935. Certainly from that time on World Messianity was a form of normative communitas increasing in organizational and structural complexity, locating itself in geographical centres, erecting permanent buildings, and in I950 officially registering itself with the Japanese government. Before I 944 the movement was centred in Meishu-sama's home and it was only after the property was purchased in Hakone and Atami that the movement had an administrative and spiritual centre.1 There is no doubt that World Messianity must be understood as normative communitas moving ever in the direction of becoming a permanent transitional community. In contrast to Turner's examples of St Francis and Caitanya whose ideal and practice of existential communitas fell into normative communitas only later at the hands of their followers, Meishu-sama himself espoused the ideal of normative communitas, for he saw the necessity of structure and organization.2 In spite of the absence of the existential type of communitas, I believe that the messianic and millenarian character of World Messianity, especially its two-age view of time, enables us to view it as a form of normative com munitas as Turner has described it. As a matter of fact Turner does not limit the occurrence of communitas to liminal situations. He believes that any structurally small and politically insignificant group can be viewed as an upholder of religious and moral values within a larger structural system. I think that the argument can be sustained that World Messianity is such a group in Japanese society. Although World Messianity has taken on a structure and organization, I suggest that much of its continuing spiritual vitality comes not from its permanence but from its self-image as a transitional, liminal communitas having as its raison d'etre the preparation for a new age. One of the most provocative suggestions of Turner vis-a-vis World Messianity is the idea of 'permanent transition'. We have seen that pure existential communitas cannot long endure and sooner or later falls into normative communitas with a semblance of structure. But the significant point is that as a form of communitas it retains something of the dynamism, vitality and creativity of that transitional process, i.e. liminality. To the extent that a group retains the quality of life of communitas it is able to play 1 Turner notes the intimate connection between property and structure. See Ritual, p. I46. 2 See Ritual, pp. I40-65 for Turner's account of St Francis and Caitanya.</page><page sequence="13">WORLD MESSIANITY 55I the fructifying role in relation to the larger society. Turner suggests, I think, that normative communitas can become a semi-permanent presence in any society, and in fact perhaps every society needs the presence of communitas to energize and purify the other institutions of society. I think that World Messianity also reflects certain traits characteristic of ideological communitas, especially in its paradigmatic dimensions. For Turner ideological communitas carries something of the meaning of a plan or design for the ideal community yet to come. World Messianity, I would suggest, sees itself, and especially its sacred grounds, as a model for the structure and character of the whole world once the new age has fully come. World Messianity believes that it provides a tangible and living model for the ideal community for the new age. Meishu-sama stated this explicitly in his speech of dedication of the Hakone sacred grounds (see p. 548 above). The biographer of Meishu-sama writes concerning models, 'One of the most important teachings of Meishu-sama is the realization of God's plan through kata, which means "prototype" in English. According to the revelation Meishu-sama received, big events first appear on a small scale... To trans form the earth into a paradise, a prototype must first be created in the spiritual realm before it can become fully manifested on earth ... To make the world a paradise, it is essential to first establish a small spot which corresponds to the spiritual centre of a worldwide paradise." Up to this point we have been discussing World Messianity as illustrative of Turner's models. However, because of certain idiosyncrasies in the Japanese setting, there are some ways that Turner's ideas do not exactly fit the Japanese situation. One aspect of Turner's understanding of anti structure is that the dominant social structure is in some sense rejected in favour of a more or less anomic and processural transition. This implies a certain 'prophetic' rejection of society and its values in favour of a new and higher form of community or as an opposing counter-structure. I would suggest that this prophetic understanding of communitas must be tempered in the Japanese context. It simply has not been a pattern in Japanese history for groups to arise or long endure in which their dominant mode was rejection of society's norms and values. By the strength, coherence and durability of her social fabric Japan makes it extremely difficult for existential communitas to continue. Japanese society has the strong tendency to domesticate those who would rebel. For example, there have been few secret societies taking an anti-government stance in Japanese history as compared with such move ments in Chinese history.Japanese religions, even those originally from China, have tended to affirm the existing order rather than express a prophetic critique. This is especially true ofJapan's new religious movements.

HAMBRICK is not a function of most of these groups, even the ones millennial and messianic in character.' To what extent did World Messianity separate itself from the dominant social structures in Japan? I submit that rejecting or remaking Japanese society per se was never a part of Meishu-sama's vision nor did he intend to found a group based on that goal. This is one of the main reasons why World Messianity as existential communitas did not long endure, if, in fact, it was ever a pure existential communitas. However, it should be noted that Meishu-sama and World Messianity did come into conflict on several occasions with the Japanese government and in that sense could be viewed as opposed to the powers-that-be.2 When Meishu-sama was a leader in Omoto kyo the government pressure was building up against that group. In I 935 the headquarters were completely demolished, the leader, Deguchi Onisaburo, and others were imprisoned and the movement proscribed. Fortunately, shortly before that holocaust, in I934, Meishu-sama had resigned from Omoto-kyo and started his own movement. In the late I930S the police kept a watch over Meishu-sama's activities and finally forbade him to do any teaching, allowing him to continue his healing ministry. The harassment continued and a combination of overwork and a fear of the police caused Meishu-sama to discontinue his activities, to be resumed only after the war pressures were lifted. Finally, in I950, soon after World Messianity was officially registered with the government, Meishu-sama was accused in the press and arrested and tried for 'seducing the public with a "superstitious method of healing" and a "nonsensical method of growing crops"'. Vicious rumours were circulated about tax evasion and bribery.3 He was jailed from 28 May to I 2 July and questioned often during that period. After he was released one of the steps he took to prevent similar occurrences in the future was to strengthen the structure and organization and in general to run it in a more business-like way. What we have here is a movement that is viewed with suspicion by the authorities, is pressured in various ways to conform, and is brought into direct confrontation with those authorities. The net result of this process was that World Messianity did in fact strengthen its own structure and moved to live in basic conformity with the larger society. Or to use Turner's terminology this I950 affair caused World Messianity to give up all semblance of existential communitas and settle into a state of normative communitas. I do feel, however, that it is important to emphasize the liminal dimension 1 See my article, 'Tradition and Modernity in the New Religious Movements ofJapan', Japanese jtournal of Religious Studies, i (June-September I974), 2I7-52. 2 The incidents prior to 1945 should be viewed in the light of the abnormally rigid condition of the government under the stress of preparation for and execution of the war led by a military clique. Perhaps in less pressured times the regulations would not have been so repressive. 3 Light from the East, p. 29.</page><page sequence="15">WORLD MESSIANITY 553 of communitas which I contend World Messianity retained, has continued to maintain, and will preserve as long as it remains a millenarian and messianic movement. For as long as it maintains its transitional character it will continue to assume the stance of liminality and communitas. Although World Messianity does not reject or radically separate itself from Japanese society, by its very nature it must separate itself from the structures of dark ness of the old age (not identified with Japanese society in particular) and prepare itself and the world for the new age. Although it does not reject the present Japanese society, neither can it totally accept that society or any society that belongs to the old age. It is perhaps the unique character of Japanese messianism to live in the tension of affirming Japanese society because it is an integral part of Japanese culture, while at the same time opposing Japanese and all other structures because of its millennial and messianic character. Finally, Turner has suggested that liminal movements and communitas, although small and marginal to the mainstream of society, can and often do have the effect of purifying and revitalizing the larger society. Perhaps it is precisely because the group is liminal that such a beneficial influence can accrue. World Messianity is not numerically large nor is it politically powerful in Japan. Its greatest gift to Japan and to the world may be its vision of a new age, the provision of entry into that new age, and the model of what that new age should be now and will be in the future. World Messianity and other similar groups in modern Japan constitute that other half of the dialectic which, Turner suggests, is necessary to the healthy functioning of a society. Quite apart from World Messianity's theological self-understanding, from Turner's sociological view World Messianity functions as a part of the creative dialectic of structure and anti-structure.</page></plain_text>
