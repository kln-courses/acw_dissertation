<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 12 The past 500 years of rock art at  Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western  Arnhem Land Robert Gunn, Bruno David, Jean-Jacques Delannoy  and Margaret Katherine Introduction The Arnhem Land plateau in northern Australia contains a particularly rich rock art assemblage.  The area has a small number of large rockshelters with numerous and extensive suites of  superimposed motifs (c. 2 per cent of 630 recorded shelters have &gt;200 images). Studies of the  rock art of Arnhem Land have primarily been concerned with attempting to understand the  age of the art, with particular interest on the Pleistocene to mid-Holocene periods (Chaloupka  1977, 1984, 1985, 1993; Chippindale and Taçon 1993; Haskovec 1992; Lewis 1998; Taçon  and Chippindale 1994). Most of these efforts have largely relied on interpretations of styles and  their respective patterns of superimposition. Taçon (e.g. 1987, 1989a, 1989b, 1992) has written  extensively on X-ray rock art from the northern perimeter of the plateau, and his work on ‘recent’  period art remains the most important study on this subject. The production of X-ray art has also  been shown to have been popular during the European-contact period of the past 200 years or so  (Chaloupka 1993; May et al. 2010; Wesley 2013). The most detailed study of rock art in the late  Holocene period is the extensive radiocarbon dating of beeswax figures by Nelson et al. (2000),  most of which fall within the past 500 years (but see Bednarik 2001). Taçon (1989b:318) has noted, ‘The most recent period of rock painting in western Arnhem  Land ... was one of great diversity and elaboration. It differs from earlier periods in terms of  subject matter, form, use of colour and symbolic content. It is this art that is still very important  to Aboriginal people’. He found that, other than X-ray art, solid or stroke infill were common  conventions that differed from X-ray only in their pattern of infill and that, in opposition to  their Kunwinjku neighbours to the east (Taylor 1996:12), the ‘Aboriginal people [of western  Arnhem Land] argue that [monochrome paintings] depict “dead” or “cooked” beings while x-ray  paintings depict living creatures’ (Taçon 1989b:320). He also suggested that X-ray art reached  its ‘full potential’ during the Freshwater Period of less than 3000 years ago (Taçon 1989b:330). Other recent forms of art that Taçon (1989b:320–324) identified from western Arnhem Land are: • Stick-figures, both static and active, depicting common activities (hunting, domestic,  ceremonial or warfare). • Hand stencils – some with finely painted patterned infill – and stencils of human and  animal feet. </page> <page sequence="2"> 304    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia • Painted sacred symbols and other geometric shapes, lines or patterns. • Appliqué images in pressed beeswax. • European-contact images (boats, horses, rifles, cattle, etc.). • Sorcery images. Overall, Taçon (1992:210–211) found that Aboriginal peoples of western Arnhem Land recognise  five classes of rock art:  • ‘Sacred Beings’: images of Dreaming Beings who put themselves onto the rock face. • ‘Dreaming’ paintings: mostly related to Dreaming stories or beliefs.  • ‘Mimi’: all older (predominantly red) paintings are said by local Aboriginal people to be  produced by Spirit-Beings who dwell in the rock, and which some archaeologists assume to  be &gt;6000 years old (Taçon 1993:114). • ‘Sorcery’ paintings: ‘paintings used for revenge or to inflict harm, but these were relatively  rare’ (Taçon 1991:211). Berndt and Berndt (1977:323) viewed sorcery paintings of deformed  or skewered figures, which were painted to cause death or illness to the victim, as a practice of  social constraint. Chaloupka (1993:207) considered the majority of sorcery paintings to have  been produced during the recent, European-contact period.  • ‘Casual’ paintings: including some hand stencils, recent stick-figures and European-contact  motifs.  These five classes of rock art are essentially the same as those identified by Chaloupka (1993:87)  who further includes the category ‘bim bawarde garruy’ (petroglyphs made in the ‘Ancestral past’). In a study of regionalism in the rock art of western Arnhem Land, Taçon defined a Jawoyn sub- style (that Chaloupka [1984:21] had first noted to be distinctive) as being: composed primarily of red-and-white bichrome x-ray paintings, with some red-and-yellow, as  well as solid red or solid white images. Some yellow solid infill figures can be found but they are  much rarer. Depictions of x-ray and solid/stroke infill macropods and humans predominate. Hand  stencils are found but painted hand or hand-and-arm stencils, typical of areas to the north, are not.  Small, delicate strokes are characteristic of outlines and infill. Very small numbers of other forms,  such as static stick figures, subjects and motifs are found at Jawoyn sites in comparison to those  associated with other language groups (Taçon 1993:115). In contrast to more northern sub-styles, where fish are the predominant faunal taxa depicted,  the Jawoyn sub-style of X-ray art was said to be dominated by paintings of macropods (Taçon  1993:117). This contrast between fish-dominated art sites of the north and macropod-dominated  sites of the south also highlights a substantial difference between the beliefs of the Jawoyn and  those of their northern neighbours. This is well exemplified by an emphasis on the macropod  Dreaming Beings Gupu and Barrk (Gunn 1992:180) in the south versus fish and ‘brightness’ with  a visual reference to the Rainbow Serpent in the north (Taçon 1992:197). A further significant  difference is the predominant use of red and white for bichrome paintings by the Jawoyn, while  those groups to the north utilised a greater variety of colour combinations (Taçon 1989:125). In this chapter, the relative chronology of motifs at the highly decorated rockshelter of Nawarla  Gabarnmang in Jawoyn lands of the Arnhem Land plateau (see Figure 1.1) is examined, to  test and refine the findings of these previous studies. Through patterns of superimposition and  absolute ages that enable particular layers of art to be dated, the range of depicted styles and subjects  that can be shown to be less than c. 500 years old within the shelter are illustrated and discussed. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="3"> 12.  The past 500 years of rock art at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land    305  Nawarla Gabarnmang Nawarla Gabarnmang is a large sandstone shelter (c. 25 × 15 × 2 m) with a horizontal ceiling  supported by a number of freestanding pillars (Figures 12.1 and 12.2). The pillars divide the  ceiling into a series of panels, most of which have been decorated with art (Figure 12.3). Many  of the central pillars have also been decorated with both recent paintings and, in some cases,  very old petroglyphs (cupules and abradings). Occupation at the site has been dated to &gt;45,000  cal BP (David et al. 2011; Geneste et al. 2010). The interior of the shelter has been substantially  modified through the removal of pillars and the collapse or removal of layers of rock ceiling to  produce a large, central occupation area (Delannoy et al. 2013; see Chapter 10).

Throughout this chapter, the radiocarbon dates undertaken directly on rock art are calibrated  as cal AD rather than cal BP ages in order to facilitate correlations with European-contact  period historical events and documentary records. Within Nawarla Gabarnmang, the individual  ceiling panels with art have been allocated unique codes for ease of identification (Figure 12.3).  Two beeswax figures on Panel F1 have each been radiocarbon dated to the period 1433–1631  cal AD, with another two beeswax figures on nearby Panels H and K4 dating to the period  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="4"> 306    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia 1658–1952 cal AD (Table 12.1). The two beeswax figures on Panel F1, and that on Panel H,  are superimposed by paintings. The beeswax figure on panel K4 superimposes yellow paintings,  but it is not itself superimposed by any art. Panel J1 has a fifth beeswax figure also dating to  c. 400 cal BP, but it is still being analysed and thus does not feature in this chapter. Panel D has  a painted motif interpreted as a representation of a horse. As horses were unknown on the plateau  before 1845 AD, the motifs that overlie the horse image must be more recent (Gunn et al. 2012;  see also Chapter 9). The overlying motifs of the individual panels are discussed below prior to  a general comment on the nature of the more recent art found in the shelter.

The past 500 years of rock art at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land    307  Panel F1 Panel F1 is one of the largest art panels in the shelter, 3.8 × 2.7 m in size and generally rectangular  in shape (Figure 12.4). It contains 126 identified images widely distributed across the panel  (Figure 12.5). The only visually prominent motif is an X-ray snake (94 × 48 cm) placed in the  very centre of the panel. Other prominent images on the panel are the smaller of a pair of white  macropods with red linear infill, and three female figures in white. Some of the many images  on this panel appear to be among the most recent in the shelter in that they appear very ‘fresh’  relative to the other paintings, include fragile white pigments and occur as, or adjacent to, the  top layer in the pattern of superimposition. Yet, Panel F1 has none of the painted X-ray fish  that dominate the other large panels (Panels D, E1 and H; see Gunn et al. 2012; Chapter 11,  this volume).  Panel F1 has at least 35 layers of superimpositions involving all of the 126 identified images  (Gunn  2016). A Harris Matrix was produced relating all instances of superimposition  (Figure 12.6). The Harris Matrix was then sorted into layers, each layer seen as representing an  artistic episode of relatively short duration (Figure 12.7). In this sorting, images were allocated  to  particular layers on the basis of their relative location in the superimposition sequence  coupled with common artistic traits – colour, form, infill, state of preservation, etc. The layers  were then grouped into six broad phases by similarities in artistic traits between adjacent layers  (Table 12.1).

The pellets, each allocated an individual image  number, are in two spatially distinct groups: pellets F-27 to F-30, associated with paintings F-55,  F-91, F-98 and F-99; and pellets F-105 to F-108, associated with painting F-104. Pellets F-27 to  F-30 are individual beeswax dots making the centres of red-painted radial designs (Figure 12.8).  Pellets F-105 to F-108 are elaborations on a white-painted female figure (Figure  12.9).  Radiocarbon dates on pellets F-27 and F-28 each calibrate within the period 1430–1640 cal AD  (Table 12.1). As all four of the pellets within this group (F-27 to F-30) are in similar states of  preservation, located within 85 cm of each other and positioned at the same level in the pattern  of superimposition, it is likely that they were applied during a single artistic event. Pellets F-28  to F-30 are all small and central to red-painted radial designs, while pellet F-27 is larger and  underlies a design in a darker shade of red and a yellow snake. Pellet F-28 also underlies the radial  design, indicating that it was applied before the red radiating lines were painted; its relationship  to an apparently underlying yellow flying-fox remains unclear.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="8"> 310    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 12.8 Beeswax pellets F-27 to F-30 showing overlying radial designs.

The past 500 years of rock art at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land    311  Most of the art that underlie these dated  pellets consists of poorly preserved fragments  in monochrome pigment. The exceptions are  a poorly preserved but intact long monochrome  snake that encircles the panel, three paintings  in red with fine-line white, hatched infill- and  a yellow fragment partially outlined in red.  These four bichrome paintings indicate that  bichrome art was practised sometime before  c. 400–500 years ago, as they underlie the  beeswax pellets dated to that age. The beeswax pellets F-105 to F-108 are  undated. We know that, with time, beeswax  pellets deteriorate from a shiny black to a crazed  grey (Nelson 2000). Although these pellets  are in comparable positioning under the well  protected shelter, they are darker in colour than  the beeswax of pellets F-27 to F-30 and lack  the crazing of the c. 400–500-year-old pellets.  This suggests that pellets F-105 to F-108 are  younger than the dated pellets F-27 and F-28.  Pellets F-105 to F-108 are in a comparable state  of preservation to a beeswax figure on Panel K4  nearby (Figure 12.10), where a radiocarbon  date calibrated to 1633–1953 cal AD has been Figure 12.10 Beeswax figure dated to 1660– obtained. We conclude that these two sets of &gt;1900 cal AD on Panel K4. beeswax pellets are likely to be of similar age, Source: Photograph by Robert Gunn. within the past 400 years.  These radiocarbon dates place four of the art phases on Panel F1 Phases III–VI in the period after  1430 cal AD. These four phases contain 97 images, or over three-quarters of the visible art of  Panel F1. The 17 images in the most recent layer were all made after c. 1650 cal AD, as indicated  by the extrapolated ages of pellets F-105 to F-108 (Table 12.2).

Tabulation of motif types by phase for Panel F1 suggests that little change in artistic conventions  took place over the past 400–500 years (Table 12.3). During that same period, there appears to  have been a seven-fold increase in the use of white pigment and white-based bichrome painting,  correlating with both a relative and an absolute decrease in the number of red and red-based  bichrome motifs (Table 12.4). Panel F1 is a horizontal ceiling panel that is well protected from  the elements, and beyond reach of passing animals. Consequently, it is unlikely that the observed  increase in white pigment is simply a function of taphonomic factors, nor can it explain the  absolute decline in the use of red pigment.

Panel H Panel H is a large, elongated panel forming a rough T-shape, 4.0 × 2.9 m long along its two axes  (Figure 12.11). It contains 132 widely distributed images, but the panel is visually dominated  by two large polychrome X-ray barramundi (180 × 84 cm and 143 × 53 cm respectively) that  may hide many underlying images. Panel H has at least 21 layers of superimposition involving  all except for two of its 132 images (Images H-7 and H-116). Interpretation of the Harris  Matrix (Figure 12.12) suggests at least six phases of art production on this panel (Table 12.5;  Figure 12.13). The two outlying motifs were included in the Harris Matrix by allocating them  to particular layers following artist traits that matched those of other nearby motifs.

The beeswax figure is overpainted by two white paintings (Figure 12.14), which  are in turn overlain by a polychrome barramundi. Beeswax Image H-122 occurs midway within  Phase V in the pattern of superimpositions. It is likely that other motifs within this phase,  although in some cases produced prior to the beeswax figure, are roughly contemporaneous with  each other due to similarities in their artistic traits.  As with Panel F1, there appears to have been little overall change in the range of motifs portrayed  on Panel H over time (Table 12.6). Again, however, over the time period represented in Panel H,  there has been a clear replacement of red and yellow by white pigment (Table 12.7). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="13"> 12.

Panel D Panel D is roughly triangular in shape, 4.8 × 3.3 m in size and has at least 15 layers of  superimposition involving all but one of its 66 images. The art is visually dominated by polychrome  paintings of two large barramundi and a range of smaller bichrome fish (Figure 12.15). These fish  paintings are the most recent art on the panel. The largest motif here (Image D-48), however,  is that of a horse (4.4 × 2.9 m; Figure 12.16) that underlies 17 paintings in five layers. Horses first  entered the plateau in 1845 AD (Leichhardt 1847). Consequently, all of the motifs overlying the  horse painting are less than 170 years old. These overlying images include two fish in a Jawoyn  X-ray convention, six fish in X-ray conventions common to the north of Jawoyn Country  and three ‘Jawoyn Lady’ paintings (see Gunn 1992:180). Interpretation of the Harris Matrix  (Figures 12.17 and 12.18) divides the art into four phases, with the horse motif occurring mid- way through Phase III (Table 12.8).  terra australis 47 Fish Smear Implement Turtle Snake Anthropomorph Macropod Bird Hand Non-Figurative  Design Other Animal Unknown Fragment </page> <page sequence="16"> 318    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Table 12.8 Summary of the Panel D art phases.

The reason for this is that the large size of, and  density of pigment on, the polychrome fish mean that large areas that were probably decorated  during earlier phases cannot now be seen. Hence, motif counts for these earlier phases are unlikely  to be representative of the actual numbers of artworks produced.  From what is observable, and consistent with the other panels already described, there appears to  have been little overall change in the range of motifs portrayed over time in Panel D (Table 12.9).  In common with Panel H, however, Panel D shows a clear trend for the replacement of red and  yellow pigments with white-based paintings around or shortly before 1845 AD (Table 12.10).

Source: Authors’ data. Discussion Patterns of superimposition can be compared across the three panels by cross-correlating common  artistic traits within individual phases. Given that some layers within some phases have been  radiocarbon dated, we can assign absolute ages to those phases. The phases can thus be grouped  into three chronological periods: 1) older than 1430 cal AD; 2) within the period 1430–1640  cal AD; and 3) 1640 cal AD – 1953 AD (Table 12.11). As painting appears to have ceased at  Nawarla Gabarnmang around 1930 AD (Gunn et al. 2012; see also Chapter 9, this volume), the  most recent period can be contained within a 290-year period, from 1640 cal AD to 1930 AD.  No age for the underlying and oldest art on these panels is known, and hence the starting date  and depth for the earliest time period is unknown (but see Chapter 11).

Therefore, the three chronological Periods for Panels D, F1 and H are: 1. Recent: 1640 cal AD – 1930 AD, with a sub-group from Panel D assigned to the time  frame 1845–1930 AD by the horse depiction. 2. Second: 1430–1640 cal AD.  3.

All probably date to a time after 1845 AD and so are less than 170 years old. • Anthropomorphs and macropods, painted in white with delicate red infill, became prominent  during the Recent Period, most probably after around 1640 cal AD. • The proportion of anthropomorphs and macropods increased in the Recent Period (after  1640 cal AD) relative to earlier Periods. • The range of motifs increased during the Second Period and continued into the Recent Period.  • Fish and non-figurative designs became more prominent during the Second and Recent  Periods. • Most white motifs occur during the Second and Recent Periods, with a marked increase in  white-based paintings (white, white-and-red bichromes and polychromes) during the Recent  Period (72 per cent of images, compared with 29 per cent in the Second Period and 7 per cent  in the First). • The use of red and red-based (red-and-white bichromes) motifs declines notably after the  beginning of the Recent Period (c. 1640 cal BP).

These changes appear to have  been gradual, rather than occurring together  as a single ‘package’ over a short period of  time; the changes do not represent an abrupt  and dramatic transformation of the overall  repertoire. These results show: • The specific impetuses behind the Recent  Period art – cultural beliefs, understandings  and codes relating to particular artistic  practices – were also restricted to this  period of time, the past 350–400 years. Figure 12.22 Implements depicted after • The time frame represented by the Recent  1430 cal AD. Period is comparable with Chaloupka’s  Source: Photo-tracing by Robert Gunn. (1993:191) ‘Contact period’, which he  proposed began around 300 years ago,  a period of cultural activity coincident first  with the arrival of Macassans and then  Europeans, Chinese and other outsiders. • New ‘traditional’ styles such as polychrome  X-ray fish and ‘Jawoyn Lady’ motifs  (Figures 12.24 and 12.25; see also  Chapters 11 and 13) developed during  the Recent Period. These new styles  contrasted with the stylistic conventions  of the previous art periods when paintings  were restricted to monochromes and  bichromes and no female figures had  achieved the high numbers, prominent  positioning and wide distribution of the  ‘Jawoyn Lady’ that became common in  Jawoyn Country during the Recent Period  (Gunn 1992:180). Chaloupka also pointed  out, as we have also found, that ‘stylistic  conventions and painting techniques of  the previous styles continued to be used’  (Chaloupka 1993:191). Overall, these results support Taçon’s  (1989b:318) finding: ‘The most recent period  of rock painting in Western Arnhem Land was  Figure 12.23 Non-figurative designs depicted one of great diversity and elaboration. It differs  after 1430 cal AD. from earlier periods in terms of subject matter,  Source: Photo-tracing by Robert Gunn. form, use of colour and symbolic content’. His  suggestion that most X-ray art was produced  over the past 1500 to 300 years (Taçon  1989b:318, 330) may have unduly stretched  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="23"> 12.  The past 500 years of rock art at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land    325  out the chronology of this art form. We have found it only during the last 300 years and it is  possible that X-ray art is younger in the southern half of the Arnhem Land plateau, which includes  Nawarla Gabarnmang, than in the north. Figure 12.24 Polychrome X-ray fish (barramundi) from Panel E1. Scale 10 cm. Source: Photo-illustration by Robert Gunn. A further implication of our results is that  Taçon’s concept of ‘rainbowness’, symbolised  by bright combinations of colour through  hatching, cross-hatching and solid bands  of pigment (Taçon 1989b:326, 1991:197),  may also be a recent phenomenon. This, in  turn, implies his proposed ‘shift in religious  orientation’ (Taçon 1989b:330) was also  relatively recent.  Alternatively, these results from Nawarla  Gabarnmang may relate to local circumstances  in southern parts of Arnhem Land only.  They may indicate recent and in some ways  restricted contacts with people from the north  and their polychrome X-ray fish art. Figure 12.25 Bichrome ‘Jawoyn Lady’ from the  nearby site A081-11.

Since white pigment is known to survive less  well, the increase in white art may be thought to result from differential preservation. The ceiling  surfaces, however, are very well protected from the elements and from animal activity, so we see  the primary cause for the changes in colours used, and in artistic styles, as cultural. Whether the  decrease in the use of red pigment and increase in white pigment at Nawarla Gabarnmang signals  changing access to pigment types, or pigment sources, and/or whether they indicate a change in the  choice of colour use relate to their symbolic associations remains unknown. No sources of either  red or white pigment are known anywhere within tens of kilometres of Nawarla Gabarnmang.
