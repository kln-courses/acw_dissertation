<plain_text><page sequence="1">Of Agues and Fevers: Malaria in the Early Chesapeake Darrett B. Rutman and Anita H. Rutman O N Tuesday, April 25, I758, Landon Carter of Sabine Hall, Virginia, recorded in his diary the imminent death of his daughter Sukey. "Her face, feet and hands are all cold and her pulse quite gone and reduced to the bones and skin that cover them and dying very hard . . . severe stroke indeed to A Man bereft of a Wife and in the decline of life." Sukey was probably about seven; Carter was forty-seven but thought of himself as old, and he had lost three wives in all.' Carter's diary entry records as personal tragedy what historical demog- raphy is presenting more formally: the fragility of life in the early Chesa- peake. Lifespans were in the main far shorter than today, shorter even than in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century New England; childhood deaths were commonplace; and women in their childbearing years ran a greater risk of death than did their husbands, the latter often being left widowers.2 What were the roots of that fragility How may it have affected the mind and form of Chesapeake society? Answers to these questions may emerge from an understanding of the endemic nature of malaria in the region. A caveat is immediately in order. Any entry into the medical life of the past must be undertaken cautiously. On the one hand, Carter and his con- temporaries referred to disease in archaic terms and in the context of an archaic medical paradigm. On the other, the nature of modern symptoma- Mr. Rutman is a member of the Department of History, University of New Hampshire; Mrs. Rutman is a lecturer on paleography and a bibliographer.

"Typicality" is vitiated by the unique circumstances of the particular patient, by the fact that discrete diseases can combine in unfamiliar manifestations, and by the fact of treat- ment itself: in the seventeenth century what effect might phlebotomy (bleeding) have had on the course of a malarial attack? and in the twentieth century how many physicians have seen an absolutely untreated case of in-Law': Parental Death in a Seventeenth-Century Virginia County," in Thad W.

Literary references to the maladies and ailments of seventeenth-and eighteenth-century Chesapeake colonists abound in surviving letters. diaries, travelers' accounts, scientific works, and the like, but no single reference points unerringly to malaria as it is described today. Hence historians can only build an inferential case for its prevalence, combining the available literary evidence with a contemporary understanding of the disease so that the two are consonant with each other, then test their case against the known attributes of the society in the present instance, its demographic attributes. These cautions lead to a first question: malaria-what is it? Put suc- cinctly, malaria is a febrile disease arising as a reaction of the body to invasion by parasites of the genus Plasmodium.' The life cycle of the Plasmodium forms a complex system involving as hosts a female anopheline mosquito and a vertebrate. In anthropomorphic terms, the human host serves as the nursery within which the parasite spends its asexual "childhood"; its sexual "adulthood" is spent in the mosquito. Figure i illustrates this complex system in a more "Plasmodia-centric," but still simple, form. A highly idealized clinical reaction in the human host is illustrated in Figure 2. From infection by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito through a tissue stage in the liver the reaction is nil. Only as the parasites enter the blood to attack the red cells do the body's defenses rise to do battle and clinical reactions begin. Headache and general malaise are occasional premonitory symptoms, but the internal battle is most marked by fever paroxysms, with the parasite's cycle setting the tempo. Relatively slight paroxysms follow the first entry into the blood; as the cycle proceeds, wave after wave of parasites are rhyth- mically released, and the host's fever rises and falls in response. Fever "spikes" I The classic caution was entered by Charles Creighton, A History of Epidemics in Britain, II (Cambridge, i894), I-2. Donald G. Bates, "Thomas Willis and the Epidemic Fever of i66i: A Commentary," Bulletin of the History of Medicine, XXXIX (i965), 393-4I2, is a brilliant modern restatement and elaboration. 4 The cumulative nature of scientific writing, with its periodic "position papers," has been our key to an understanding of malaria. As basic references and guides to the pre-I972 literature we have used Forest Ray Moulton, ed., A Symposium on Human Malaria with Special Reference to North America and the Caribbean Region (Washington, D. C., I941); Mark F. Boyd, ed., Malariology: A Com- prehensive Survey of All Aspects of This Group of Diseases from a Global Stand- point (Philadelphia, I949); G.

Associated with the paroxysms are secondary symp- toms. The host may experience headache (sometimes with an accompanying eye pain), loss of appetite, nausea, generalized aches and pains and specific abdominal pain, and occasional respiratory difficulties, weakness, and ver- tigo. An observer might discern vomiting, skin eruptions, palpable enlarge- ment of the spleen and liver and a generalized swelling of the limbs, nose- bleed, diarrhea, jaundice, and pallor, the last indicative of severe anemia. If the body's defenses ultimately prevail, the cycle is broken and at least the parasites in the blood are destroyed. Remission and recovery follow. From long association with humans, however, Plasmodium has evolved its own defenses against theirs. Defeated in the blood, the parasites can remain ensconced in some manner in the liver.5 Within eight to ten months after the primary attack they will again enter the blood. The cycle begins anew, and the fever returns, calling forth counter defenses on the part of the host. The initial attack starts a process by which an immunity is acquired, and each successive relapse strengthens the immunity until all outward symptoms disappear. The immunity does not last long-only a few years. But the reintroduction of Plasmodia by the bite of a female Anopheles brings on enough of an internal reaction to reinvigorate the immunity, even though it may not result in an observable reaction in the host. Thus far our intent has been to sketch quickly and in idealized terms the principal features of malaria, in order to lay ground for a more complicated discussion. First, our reference has been to genus Plasmodium, but genus implies species, and indeed there is a multiplicity of species. Four of these infect humans, two of them commonly: Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum.6 Between these two species there are clear differences in the reaction of the human host. The patterns of fever spikes vary, reflecting different patterns of parasitic development within the body. The intensity of the disease also varies, vivax being the more benign, falciparum the more virulent; mortality directly associated with untreated vivax is estimated at under 5 percent, while mortality associated with untreated falciparum can rise as high as 25 percent.7 The classic relapse pattern is that of Plasmodium vivax, there being little or no relapse associated with falciparum. Acquired immunity likewise varies between species. Immunity to vivax is 5 The relapse mechanism of the parasite is not clearly understood.

And while there is a pronounced innate immunity to vivax among blacks, there seems to be no race-specific immunity to falciparum. Whites and blacks are clearly susceptible to infection- indeed, a significant portion of modern research on falciparum malaria takes place in black Africa-but blacks seem to tolerate an attack somewhat better than whites. Among both whites and blacks can be found what is termed the "sickle-cell trait," which seems to confer a resistance to infection, although the interdependence of this genetic trait and malaria on the one hand and the long association of blacks with a malarious Africa on the other have made the trait generally more common among blacks than among Caucasians.8 8 Coatney et al., Primate Malarias, 283: "There appears to be no racial or innate immunity among Negroes against falciparum malaria as has been observed for vivax malaria. . .. However, the Negro does have a tendency to be able to clinically tolerate falciparum malaria infections better than the Caucasians. The presence of genetic traits which inhibit parasite multiplication or survival, such as sickle cell hemoglobin and enzyme deficiencies, have been reported but are not universally accepted." Cf. Peter H. Wood, Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from i670 through the Stono Rebellion (New York, I974), 88-89.</page><page sequence="6">36 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY Within species, moreover, there are strains-an unknown number, of which only a few have been isolated in the laboratory and there are clear differences in the reaction of the host to particular strains of the same species. Again, the pattern of fever spikes will vary slightly, but more important with reference to both species and strains is the fact that acquired immunities tend to be species- and strain-specific. A person who is infected by Plasmodium vivax, St. Elizabeth Strain, for example, tends to develop resistance only to that strain. Second, we have referred to the mosquito vector as simply the female anopheline, but this masks a complex reality involving a genus Anopheles (within the family Culicidae and tribe Anophelini), six subgenera, and a variety of species and subspecies that vary in range, breeding habitat, and biting characteristics, and also as carriers of the parasite. Anopheles atropos and Anopheles bradleyi, for example, breed in the saltwater pools and marshes of the coast from Texas to Maryland, but atropos prefers water with a high salt content, bradleyi a low; and while bradleyi in common with most Anopheles, tends to confine its biting to dusk, atropos will swarm and bite in bright sunlight. Anopheles crucians is a species of the southeastern coastal plain, frequenting fresh to slightly brackish swamps and pools and the margins of ponds and lakes. In the early twentieth century it was suspected as the primary vector in tidewater Virginia, because of its high density in the area and its propensity to enter houses to bite.9 Anopheles punctipennis has the greatest range of any North American species, breeding in shaded springs and pools or along the margins of streams from southern Canada to New Mexico and along the Pacific coast. It bites only outdoors, entering houses in late fall only to hibernate. Anopheles quadrimaculatus prefers open sunlit waters for breeding, and although it is one of the anopheles most highly susceptible to Plasmodium (hence most likely to carry the parasite back to human beings), it seems to have a decided preference for the blood of cows and horses. All of the anopheline mosquitoes share certain characteristics. They are creature of short flight, normally ranging no more than one to two miles from their breeding places. They are highly affected by the weather. Optimal conditions for biting include a bright moonlit night, humidity about 85 percent, and a temperature in the low to mid-eighties. In a temperate climate the onset of cold weather brings on a suspension of all anopheline activity. Species and strains of Plasmodium on the one hand; variety of Anopheles on the other-yet we have only touched on some of the many variables 9James Stevens Simmons, "The Transmission of Malaria by the Anopheles Mosquitoes of North America," in Moulton, ed., Symposium on Human Malaria, II4; Stanley B. Freeborn, "Anophelines of the Nearctic Region," in Boyd, ed., Malariology, I, 388.</page><page sequence="7">AGUES AND FEVERS 37 involved in what malariologist Mark F. Boyd has described as the most complex and contradictory of disease systems."' A third set of complications relates to the behavior of malaria in communities. In the malarial system the disease manifestation in humans is only one part. Anopheles must be infected by a human host, who, in turn, must be infected by Anopheles, with the circular transmission dependent on both. An anopheline mosquito must have access to, and must bite, a person (and not a nearby horse or cow) when the blood of that person is carrying the single form of the parasite that will infect the mosquito in general, during or shortly after a malarial attack. After enough time has elapsed to allow the completion of the parasitic cycle within the mosquito, the mosquito must bite again, passing on the single form of the parasite that will bring about reinfection. To use technical terms, an Anopheles with a sporozoite-clear saliva biting a person free of gametocytes will have no more effect than to provoke a swat and a scratch! Within any given malarial community the degree to which the system is established is clearly dependent on the rate of transmission of the parasite from Anopheles to human being and back to mosquito through properly timed bites. At the lowest levels of endemicity few infected mosquitoes are abroad, few in the human population play host to the parasite, and transmission is only occasional. At the very highest levels of endemicity-hyperendemicity virtually all anopheline mosquitoes are infected, and they are so numerous that no member of the human population can avoid being bitten every night. Human infection is then virtually ioo percent, and transmission is virtually constant. Between these extremes lie an indefinite number of levels of endemicity. To speak of levels of endemicity is not to speak directly of levels of clinical morbidity that is, the number of persons in the population dis- playing observable symptoms. Recall that malarial infection results in the human host in a species- and strain-specific immunity, but one of limited duration that is dependent for prolongation on reinfection (although not necessarily morbidity). In a malarial community the development of individ- ual immunities tends to create a degree of group immunity. How effective that group immunity will be depends on the transmission level, or the level of endemicity. In communities of low endemicity individuals will be infected less often and group immunity will be lower than in areas of high endemicity. Clinical morbidity, group immunity, and endemicity levels interact to force a curvilinear relationship between the first and last, as sketched in Figure 3. If we were to measure the endemic and clinical morbidity levels of a number of communities, we would find that morbidity climbs as endemicity rises, since a 10 Mark F. Boyd, "Epidemiology of Malaria: Factors Related to the Inter- mediate Host," in Boyd, ed., Malariology, 1, 552.</page><page sequence="8">38 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY greater percentage of infectious bites by Anopheles leads to symptomatic malarial attacks. Yet the rate of morbidity will be balanced at some point by the rate of immunities in the population and then will begin to decline until, in a hyperendemic situation, morbidity is largely limited to children, non- immune newcomers to the community, and pregnant women. Moreover, within any given community the level of endemicity (and consequently clinical morbidity) will tend to stabilize at a fixed figure. The figure may rise or fall as the number of anopheline mosquitoes in the area rises or falls, or as the number of the nonimmune changes, or when the onset of a new strain or species makes prior immunities irrelevant, or even as the spatial organization of the society shifts: a trend toward urban clustering, for example, will tend to decrease the proportionate access of mosquitoes to the population and bring a decline in the endemic level. But although the level of endemicity may change, there will invariably be a tendency toward stasis. " Two other aspects of the malarial system in communities must be sketched before we turn to the subject at hand malaria in the early Chesa- peake region. First, whatever the endemic or morbidity level of a population, there is an areal definition to that population. The point is best made by an example. Consider a village located beside a saltwater swamp in which Anopheles bradleyi breed. Given the flight and breeding limitations of bradleyi, it is clear that even if our exemplifying village is highly endemic, another, four miles away beside a freshwater pond, need not be. The areal boundaries of the malarious population are thus defined by the mosquito. Presume that the pond by our second village is a breeding area for Anopheles quadrimaculatus. What then} It will remain malaria-free only if no one laden with gametocytes travels to it from the first village. In this case the areal boundaries are set by levels of population mobility as well as by the mosquito. The example may seem exaggerated, but the abruptness of areal boundaries was clear even in the i890s when Walter Reed noted that while malaria was endemic among the soldiers of Washington Barracks, on the low flats bordering the Anacostia and Potomac rivers in the District of Columbia, it was significantly less prevalent "among those who live in the more elevated section of the city" away from the flats.12 Second, in a temperate climate such as that of the Chesapeake malaria cannot achieve the hyperendemic level that follows from near-constant trans- mission. As we have noted, the onset of cold weather inhibits anopheline " A few malariologists, notably Ronald Ross, and statistician Alfred J. Lotka have attempted to reduce the malarial system to a mathematical model. See Mark F. Boyd, "Epidemiology: Factors Related to the Definitive Host," ibid., 683-687. 12 Hugh R.

In the absence of transmis- sion, morbidity declines, individual immunities diminish, and the non- immune increase; group immunity thus deteriorates, leaving the population vulnerable to what is to come. Latent infections will persist over the winter, and as these bring on a few malarial attacks in the spring, as cases of vivax contracted during the previous fall reappear as relapses, and as mosquitoes start biting again, transmission restarts and the malarial system is reinvigo- rated. The endemic level, having declined during the winter, rises again. Symptomatic morbidity steadily increases through the spring and summer to a peak in the autumn, then abruptly declines with the coming of another winter. Figure 4, a seasonal plot of 614 malaria cases treated at The Johns Hopkins University Hospital in the early i890s, displays the seasonality of the two major species of malaria then current in the Chesapeake area. Was there malaria in the early Chesapeake? Historiographically, the question has been asked mainly with reference to Virginia, and the answer</page><page sequence="10">40 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY has been mixed. Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker, reflecting a traditional view, wrote in 1914 of the "swarms of mosquitoes" that rose from "the stagnant pools" around Jamestown and attacked the settlers of i607 with a sting more deadly than that of the Indian arrow or the Spanish musket ball.'' In I930 the tradition was challenged by Wyndham B. Blanton. "No one doubts that there were marshes, mosquitoes and sickness along the James River," but "there is no evidence . . . that malaria was responsible for a preponderating part of the great mortalities." Blanton was rebutted by John Duffy in I953: with malaria in the Carolina lowcountry to the south and among the French and English to the north, "it is highly improbable that the early settlers in Virginia were exempt." In I957 Blanton replied that there was no natural habitat around Jamestown for Anopheles quadrimaculatus (even if true, Blanton ignored the fact that quadrimaculatus is but one of many species). He also contended that malaria was not introduced until late in the century by which time the colonists, by clearing the forests, had created a habitat for mosquitoes and that it was brought by slaves from the malaria-infested areas of the west African coast."' This mini-debate was in reality a non-debate, for the participants had different frames of reference. Blanton's gaze was fixed on the great mortalities of the years to the mid- I620S, from which he extrapolated forward;'4 Duffy, with a broader view of the whole colonial period, inferred from the whole to the part. All indications are that malaria was imported into the Americas by Europeans. The disease in its milder form (vivax) is thought to have been general in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Oliver Crom- well seems to have been only one of the more prominent sufferers. The more virulent falciparum is thought to have been prevalent in large parts of Africa. 13 Thomas J. Wertenbaker, Virginia Under the Stuarts, i607-i688 (Princeton, N. J., I914), ii; Wyndham B.

When or from where such persons arrived in Virginia directly from England or by way of the Caribbean is irrelevant and certainly in- determinable. Although a variety of strains and perhaps even both major species may have been introduced by diverse carriers at a fairly early date, a more probable model, given the flow of immigration and the prevalence of vivax in Europe and falciparum in Africa, would have strains of the former entering during the first half of the century, followed by the gradual estab- lishment (perhaps spotty) of areas of stable, low-level endemicity. The shattering of this picture would occur as blacks in numbers began arriving from a variety of African areas, bringing with them new strains of vivax, and falciparum.'7 In this model, symptomatic morbidity-the number of clinical cases would rise gradually to about i650, by which time the occa- sional, seemingly random cases of the early decades would be giving way to seasonal outbreaks. Through the remainder of the century epidemic-like incidents would mark the entry of each new strain or species, the general level of malaria morbidity rising a bit higher in the aftermath of each such outbreak.'8 The model also suggests that a qualitative change occurred sometime in the second half of the century asfalciparum entered the colony, precipitating more virulent and wracking attacks, a phenomenon also noted by Peter Wood in his study of South Carolina slavery. The evidence from Carolina suggests to Wood that the benign vivax was prevalent in the i670s but was supplanted by the more virulent falciparum in the i68os.'9 The literary evidence for Virginia supports this model, although in relating the archaic and imprecise terminology of the sources to the modern symptomatology of the disease we enter on the most treacherous ground of medical history. Blanton, for example, keyed his search for malaria on the word "ague" as referring to the combination of chills and fevers so generally associated in the popular mind with the disease. But chills may accompany fevers other than malarial, and malarial fevers arenot always accompanied by chills. In a modern study of 20I paroxysms, i37 were found to be 17 White susceptibility to diseases prevalent among blacks would be the other side of the coin with regard to Philip D. Curtin's thesis of black susceptibility to diseases prevalent among whites.

It has been extended to incorporate elementary shifts in the human population and changes in the immunity level to reflect assumptions as to the sequential introduction of species (vivax followed by falciparum) and the periodic introduction of new strains. 19 Wood, Black Majority, 87.</page><page sequence="13">AGUES AND FEVERS 43 unaccompanied by chills, leading the investigators to conclude that "the term Ichills and fevers' inadequately described" a malarial attack.20 Similarly, the words "intermittent" and "remittent," used in the sources as adjectives for "fever," may or may not refer to the characteristic fever spikes of malaria, as may "quotidian," "tertian," and "quartan" used to describe the timing of the spikes. References to chinchona or its synonyms-Peruvian bark, Jesuit bark, or simply "the bark" may also be indicative of malaria, for chin- chona was introduced into Europe as a specific remedy for what is generally considered to have been malaria. Such references are not infallible, for the bark was sometimes utilized for fevers other than malarial, and its efficacy was widely questioned; hence it was not invariably given.2' Nevertheless, we must have a measure of confidence: even if many of the references to ague, the varieties of fever, and "the bark" are misapplied, the remainder correctly point to malaria. From the sources it seems clear that the "agues and fevers" that were only occasional in the first fifty years in Virginia became both more general and more severe (reflecting the entry of falciparum?) in the second fifty and on into the eighteenth century. There is no need here to review the occasional evidence for seventeenth- century malaria cited by Blanton.22 Clearly, by the i68os the "seasoning" that period of illness which almost inevitably befell a newcomer to the Chesapeake was associated with what we can take for malaria. Newcomers might assume any sickness that struck them to be a "seasoning," as Robert Beverley noted in his History of Virginia and as George Hume did in I723. To Hume a whole succession of illnesses from "a severe flux'' to a "now and then" bout with "the fever and ague" added up to "a most severe'' seasoning.23 But the long-time resident of Virginia was more precise.

And again, in another letter: "My Sister has had her seasoning . . . two or three fits of a feaver and ague." John Clayton, Virginia's scientific parson, wrote of "Seasonings, which are an intermiting feaver, or rather a continued feaver with quotidian paroxisms," in describing that same year the "distempers" among the English.24 By the i68os sharp geographical differences in levels of health were being noted in the colony. To a French traveler of i686-i687 the inhabitants of tidewater Gloucester County "looked so sickly that I judged the country to be unhealthy"; those of Stafford and old Rappahannock were obviously health- ier, "their complexions clear and lively." The Virginians gave him a reason he considered "quite plausible": "along the seashore and also along the rivers which contain salt, because of the tide, the inhabitants in these places are rarely free from fever during the hot weather; they call this a local sickness; but the salt in the rivers disappears about twenty leagues from the seas, just as one enters the county of Rappahannock, and those who live beyond that point do not suffer from it." Clayton, too, noted the geographic difference, adding a hint of autumnal seasonality: "so far as the Salt Waters reach the Country is deemed less healthy. In the Freshes they more rarely are troubled with Seasonings, and those Endemical Distempers about September and October."25 All three phenomena are commensurate with a hypothesis of widespread malaria. As we have seen, autumnal seasonality is inherent in temperate-zone malaria; so too are the susceptibility of newcomers they must develop immunities to the specific species and strains of Plasmodia "The first sickness that any New-Comer happens to have there, he unfairly calls a Seasoning, be it Fever, Ague, or any thing else, that his own folly, or excesses bring upon him. 24 William Fitzhugh to Henry Fitzhugh, July i8, i687, Fitzhugh to Dr. Ralph Smith, July i, i687, in Richard Beale Davis, ed., William Fitzhugh and His Chesapeake World, i676-170I.'

Time would be required to create in newly settled areas the conditions necessary to maintain the endemic levels that existed in older areas. 26 For the eighteenth century the literary evidence is clearer, and there is no question among historians as to the prevalence of malaria. John Oldmixon, who presumably drew some of his information from William Byrd II, wrote at the turn of the century that "the Seasoning here, as in other parts of America, is a Fever or Ague, which the Change of Climate and Diet generally throws new Comers into; the Bark is in Virginia a Sovereign Remedy to this Disease." Beverley wrote of the Virginians' "Intermitting Fevers, as well as their Agues," as "very troublesome'' and cited "Cortex Peruviana" as a remedy that "seldom or never fails to remove the Fits." Byrd dosed with the bark his family, himself, and his fellow commissioners of the North Carolina boundary survey. In I735 he referred to the shipment of "infused" bark to Virginia by England's "Drugsters and Apothecarys" that is, bark which had been steeped in water, the water being used in England and the residual bark shipped to the colonies as "almost as bad as Murder." Hugh Jones wrote of a people "subject to feavers and agues, which is the country distemper, a severe fit of which (called a seasoning) most expect, some time after their arrival." Chinchona was "a perfect catholicon for that sickness . . which being taken and repeated in a right manner, seldom fails of a cure."27 26 In contrast to descriptions of other parts of Virginia, John Banister's descrip- tions of the falls area of theJames make no mention of illness and disease, implying a relatively disease-free area during the late I7th century.

"28 Indeed, here and there in the literature are such detailed accounts that one is tempted to diagnose individual cases Landon Carter's Sukey, for example. Autumnal fevers were pronounced in both I756 and I757, Carter writing of the fall of the latter year that it was a "very Aguish Season" when nothing "but the barke" would do, and noting that "it has been more usefull this year than common." During the autumn of I756 Sukey was among the sixty-odd in his family and labor force to take sick. A year later, in the midst of a still worse fever season, Sukey came down again, falling into a monthly pattern of attacks that extended through the autumn and early winter, subsided during the coldest weather, then reappeared in March I758. In describing his daughter's illnesses Carter noted time and again the secondary symptoms associated with malaria, from nausea and vomiting to pains and pallor. But most telling is his running account of the course of Sukey's fever. In Figure 5 the description of five days of Sukey's first I757 fever attack in August is superimposed on a modern fever chart of a quotidian (intermittent-remittent type) clinical attack of Plasmodium falciparum. Was Sukey's a case of malaria? Diagnosis from such evidence is impossible: all the historian can hope for is consonance between historical evidence and medical under- standing. The literary description of Sukey's illness seems entirely consonant with malaria.29 Presuming that, from the literary evidence, a circumstantial case can be made for the presence of malaria in the Chesapeake region, or at least in Virginia, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, what demographic effects might follow? Can we discern these effects and substantiate to an extent the literary case already made? In other words, does the hypothesis of malaria fit, perhaps even explain, the empirical evidence? The question requires consideration of as much as possible of the demographic analysis of early America done to date.

It has been confined for the most part to explorations of particular locales, and for both regions such local studies are few. Investigation has nonetheless advanced to the point where a few basic phenomena seem to be coming into focus-four in particular with regard to mortality. First, radically different mortality sched- ules seem to have obtained in New England and the Chesapeake region. Men and women in the northern colonies tended to live considerably longer lives than did their contemporaries to the south. Second, in the Chesapeake and in seventeenth-century Salem, Massachusetts (but not apparently in other New England areas studied so far), women fifteen to forty-five years, the child- bearing years, seem to have run a substantially greater risk of death than did males of the same age. The third finding emerges from the second: even within a particular region and time period mortality rates in general, and sex- specific mortality rates in particular, seem to have varied by locality. Finally, in New England at least, mortality rates shifted over time. In the eighteenth century life expectancies rose from seventeenth-century levels in some areas and for some segments of the population and fell in others, the net effect being a tendency toward convergence the "washing out" of differences. All four of these phenomena can be seen in Table I, drawn from studies of Andover and Salem, Massachusetts, and Middlesex County, Virginia. But Table I also suggests, in its confusion of sample definitions and age group- ings, that such cross-study comparisons furnish grounds for only very broad general statements. Still, the broad statements are enough to prompt questions. Why a difference in mortality between New England and the Chesapeake.' Why a shift in mortality over time within New England. Why, in the seventeenth century, a sex-related difference in mortality during the years between fifteen and forty-five? Piecemeal explanations have been offered with respect to the New England data. Rising mortality rates and falling life expectancies be- tween the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have been attributed to the rise of population density to the point where infectious diseases could be supported. Although this plausible supposition accounts for some of the data, it does not explain those from Salem where mortality rates tended to fall slightly. Maris Vinovskis has related high death rates among Salem's females in the seventeenth century to maternal mortality-but were the conditions of 30 Philip J. Greven, Jr., "Historical Demography and Colonial America," Wil- liam and Mary Quarterly, 3d Ser., XXIV (i967), 438-454. Maris A.

Lockridge, Susan L. Norton, and Vinovskis's own.

Most importantly, none of the piecemeal answers applies to the sharp contrast between New England and Chespeake mortality. Does a consideration of malaria suggest a more general answer? The most obvious impact of malaria is on the general level of public health. Malaria is not notorious as a "killer" disease: the 5 and 25 percent mortality rates cited earlier are extremes. It is rather "the great debilitator"; it lowers the level of general health and the ability to resist other diseases. One modern study estimates that for every death ascribed to malaria in an infected population, five additional deaths are actually due to malaria acting in concert with other diseases.32 Carter's Sukey is a case in point. Weakened by her bouts with a malarial fever, and undoubtedly anemic, she died in the spring of I758 from what appeared to be a respiratory infection. That an inverse relationship exists between the degree of malaria morbid- ity and the death rate is indicated in modern Guatemala. A malaria eradica- tion program was initiated there in I957, and the death rate declined 20 percent between I958 and i963. In Ceylon, where both eradication and a concerted attempt to expand medical facilities began immediately after World War II, the death rate declined by two-thirds between I946 and I953, with roughly 23 percent of the decline attributable to the malaria eradication program.33 Thus a hypothesis of a malarious Chesapeake and a relatively nonmalarious New England might well explain a considerable part of the disparity between New England and Chesapeake mortality rates. Note, however, that we refer to New England as "relatively" free of malaria. We mean to imply a difference of degree rather than an absolute difference, for there is evidence of malaria in seventeenth-century New 31 Vinovskis, "Mortality Rates," Jour. Econ.

Duffy describes "attacks of pernicious malaria" in Boston in i658, western Connecticut in i668, Salem in i683, and Boston again in i690. For some reason, however, the northern boundary of malaria shifted in the eighteenth century, leaving New England entirely free of the disease after roughly the mid-century mark.34 The whole question of endemic (as distinct from epidemic) disease is undeveloped in early American historiography in general, and for New England specifically,35 but one can make a calculated guess that malaria had only a marginal foothold in New England even in the seventeenth century and that levels of endemicity varied among the closed populations of the area. Among some, the disease was virtually nonexistent (but the population, lacking immunity, would be susceptible to sudden, short-lived periods of morbidity); among others, malaria was relatively well established. This view would be consonant with the findings of modern malariologists who break down national malariometric and morbidity rates into regional and even village rates and find enormous variety. It would also be consonant with the diversity of mortality rates being found by historians of New England and if we assume that Salem was an area of relatively well- ensconced malaria with the two peculiarities of Salem's mortality schedule presented by Vinovskis. The first is the suggestion that while in other New England towns that have been studied mortality rose in the eighteenth century, Salem's mortality declined-that there was, in effect, a tendency among the towns for mortality to converge. Such a tendency would be very familiar to students of eradication programs;36 and what was the dis- appearance of malaria from eighteenth-century New England but a form of natural eradication? The second is the high death rate for women in their childbearing years, which, although unique to Salem among the seventeenth- 3 Duffy, Epidemics, 206-207, 2I3.

Historical Essays (Baltimore, i966), is that historians in general, and medical histo- rians specifically, have emphasized the story of medical disasters (epidemics). "It is easier to find records of a sudden 'visitation' than it is to trace obscure, endemic conditions; and once written, the former makes more spectacular reading. Hence the universal attention accorded 'the Black Death.' Hence also the neglect of contempo- rary endemic diseases, which in the long run were more fatal and perhaps equally significant in their social consequences" (p. 278). 36 For example, Gray, "Decline of Mortality," Pop.

Exaggerated maternal mortality can be directly associated with endemic malaria, a relationship intuitively perceived in the malarious South of a half- century ago by country doctors who routinely dosed their pregnant patients with quinine, and more recently demonstrated in a controlled study of 250 pregnant women in urban Nigeria.37 The nature of the linkage is still undetermined, but the indirect evidence indicates that pregnancy tends to nullify immunities, paving the way for a build-up of parasites, morbidity, and pronounced anemia, with a consequent hazard of abortion, premature labor, and the childbirth death of both mother and infant. Modern medical re- searchers cannot, of course, measure mortality directly, for of necessity they intervene to stop the course of the disease. Neither can modern medical research duplicate the conditions that exaggerated the hazards in the seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries: large households crowded into small houses, exposing anemic, periodically feverish mothers-to-be to contagious ailments; living conditions that can only be described as dirty, with a consequent exposure of the mother to septicemia; and above all, a counterproductive medical practice: the bleeding and stringent dieting that William Byrd imposed on his pregnant and presumably malarious and anemic wife could hardly have been efficacious.38 Analogy can, to an extent, supply what the medical research leaves out. Puttalam district, Ceylon, in the late I930S was an area roughly comparable to Middlesex County, Virginia, in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Both were rural; both were devoid of modern medicine; in both, childbirth was managed by traditionally rather than medically oriented midwives; and both (Puttalam district for a certainty and Middlesex for the sake of argument) were malarious.

In both areas females in their fertile years ran an exaggerated risk of death in comparison to males. The link between the two areas may well have been malaria, and for the historian who must work from highly tangential evi- dence the extent to which female deaths exceed male deaths in a given area may well be a rough measure of the hold of malaria on that area. If the suggestion is sound, Middlesex and whatever part of the Chesapeake region it accurately reflects were highly malarious. What of the social ramifications of malaria?

Probably not. Even the periodic "agues and fevers" of malaria could be culturally normative rather than culturally exceptional. This is the implication of the almost casual language with which Fitzhugh reported the end of his sister's illness- "and so consequently her seasoning [is] over." Even in Carter's diary most of the seizures are noted in a commonplace way: "Judy's fever left her this day. Lucy her ague and fever at 5 this eve.''41 Only in extreme situations did illness become something more than commonplace, as it did for Carter in the terrible year I757. "It is necessary that man should be acquainted with affliction," Carter wrote in exasperation toward its end; "and 'tis certainly nothing short of it to be confined a whole year in tending one's sick Children. Mine are now never well."42 It is, perhaps, this cultural definition of illness that underlies the diverse reactions to endemic and epidemic diseases com- mented on by Richard Shryock: the former are "taken for granted," the latter provoke hysteria.43 That said, however, we propose three ways in which endemic malaria, even if matter-of-factly accepted by its victims, conceivably affected their society. What follows can only be quick, tentative, and suggestive. The subject of the interrelationship of disease and society is only now coming into prominence under such rubrics as "medical anthropology," and potentially useful models from contemporary studies are still few and rudimentary." In addition, we have been able to associate the disease only generally with Virginia through literary evidence, and only with regard to one small groups used (Puttalam has been graphed on the basis of the mid-years of the age groups 5-I4, I5-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and age 70 for the cohort 65-plus; Middlesex on the basis of smoothed data for the mid-years of 5-year groups), the different species and strains of plasmodium prevalent in the two areas, and, above all, the differences in the populations at risk. In Puttalam the entire population of the district, I937-I938, was at risk; for Middlesex the population at risk is married and widowed adults, the figures being based on the experience of subjects born over the span of years i65o-I7Io who both survived to a marriageable age and chose at some time to marry. If the Puttalam population at risk had been so restricted, the resulting "bulge" of female deaths during the fertile years would undoubtedly have been somewhat greater. 40 Chinard, ed., Huguenot Exile; Wright, ed., Prose Works, 202. 41 Davis, ed., Fitzhugh Letters; Greene, ed., Diary of Carter, I, 203.

The most obvious interrelationship between disease and society is that defined by economics. What is the cost to the society of an endemic disease such as malaria? In modern economic scholarship the question has been posed in terms of the economic gain to a society of an eradication program and the answer seems to be coming back as a negative. Robin Barlow has summarized the findings: eradication of malaria brings about a population rise by reducing the death rate and, more important, by raising both the birth rate, as more children are successfully delivered, and the rate of survival through childhood. Moreover, the reduction of mortality, morbidity, and debility increases the quantity and quality of labor output. An immediate economic gain follows, but the society loses in the long run as the added population makes increasing demands on the public sector for services, reduces per capita income, and curtails capital formulation.45 This econo- metric approach is cold and impersonal, and it runs counter to the historian's normal prejudice by requiring an "if" proposition what if there had been no malaria in the Chesapeake? But there is some profit in applying it, if only to discount any quick generalization as to malaria and economic back- wardness. Without malaria the rate of natural increase in the Chesapeake and the number of people living there would have been greater. This probably would not have resulted in an increased demand for public services, for the concept of public service was weakly defined; yet an increase in a population, dependent on a single cash crop and a finite market, would have resulted in greater production and lower prices and consequently lower per capita income. Only if receiving lower prices for tobacco had led Virginians to an earlier and more energetic acceptance of economic diversification would the overall economy have improved.46 Another approach is perhaps more revealing. The agricultural economy of the Chesapeake region was labor-intensive: in the main a person's eco- nomic position depended on the application of labor to land.

The risk, however, was unevenly spread. The planter who relied on his own labor, with that of his wife and perhaps a single servant or slave, chanced disaster more than did the planter who had built up a labor force of ten or twenty persons. Imagine the small planter struck down by a malaria attack at the moment most appropriate for the transplantation of tobacco seedlings from seedbeds to fields, or when the ripe tobacco leaves had to be cut and housed. A good percentage, perhaps even all, of his year's income might be lost. The intensity of the dependence on labor is illustrated by Peter Mountague of Middlesex County whose one male servant ran away at harvest time in I70I, causing Mountague to complain to the county court in I702 that he had sustained as a consequence "the whole loss of the last crop."49 It is true that larger planters could be hard hit. Armistead Churchill of Middlesex lost thirty slaves in one six-month period in I737.50 But a large labor force insured against catastrophe. Even at the height of his troubles in I757 Carter still had laborers in his fields. Moreover, in a society in which working lives were short, the amassment of capital provided defense against the economic effects of death. The short-lived planter, large or small, frequently left orphaned children.5' But the chances that orphans of the large planter would start their working years with enough capital in the form of labor to protect them from disaster were far greater than those of orphans of the small planter. Gener- ation after generation the latter had to begin their working lives with no Wood, Black Majority, 9i, argues that in South Carolina the combination of malaria (together with yellow fever), black resistance to both diseases, and the labor- intensive economy -must have done a great deal to reinforce the expanding rationale behind the enslavement of Africans." Wood attempts to demonstrate that South Carolina's whites, from an early date, thought of the blacks as more resistant to disease-this in sharp contrast to Winthrop D. Jordan, White Over Black. Ameri- can Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550-i812 (Chapel Hill, N. C., i968), 259-265. We have found no evidence in Virginia to substantiate Wood's thesis. 48 Marquis de Chastellux, Travels in North-America, in the Years 1780, 1781, and 1782, 2d ed., II (London, I787), 297. 4 Middlesex County, Va., MS Order Book, No. 3, i694-I705, 483, Virginia State Library, Richmond. 50 The Parish Register of Christ Church, Middlesex County, Va., from 1653 to 1812 (Richmond, Va., i897), 275-276.

These in- equalities may well have contributed to economic polarization over time.52 For the planter who, by virtue of ability, energy, or luck, lived insulated from the economic consequences of disease had a far better chance to improve his economic position and, consequently, still greater insulation. A consideration of disease and economics has led to one aspect of the structure of Chesapeake society exaggerated economic polarization. But disease interacts with social structure in other ways as well. Provision must be made for illness. This was in part an individual matter, as it was for Dennis Conyers when he sold one hundred acres on the Piankatank River in Middlesex to Peter Godson on the condition that "the said Pe- ter . . . administer Physick or Physical means to the said Dennis for his own person for the space of one year."53 For the whole society the provisions for illness take on a more general form. The phenomenon of every planter his own practitioner has long been noted. Equally to the point are the phenom- ena of every claimant to the title "doctor" being engaged as one and, notwithstanding the aspersions of Byrd, the high esteem accorded physicians in the Chesapeake area.54 On a still higher level of generalization one can suggest that illness and early death were related to the basic social organiza- tion of the Chesapeake. In the continuing study of Middlesex County of which this article is a part, the region is emerging not as an area of isolated plantations and individuals but as a mosaic of close-knit neighborhoods and kinship groups. Few aspects of life reflect this mosaic more clearly than do illness and death. Illness brought visitation, and kin and neighbors clustered about the sickbeds of the county.55 Death, particularly the death of parents with the consequent orphaning of children, evoked kinship obligations, and 52Darrett B.

Oldmixon, British Empire, I, 294, presumably reflecting Byrd, wrote that the Virginians "reckon it among Blessings" that they had few doctors, "fancying the Number of their Diseases would encrease with that of their Physi- cians." These attitudes are in sharp contrast to the social position accorded physicians in Middlesex society. 55The phenomenon can be glimpsed in depositions submitted to the county court in cases involving disputed wills-for example, the probate proceedings surrounding</page><page sequence="28">58 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY relations (including such relations as godparents) moved to care for the parentless. The effect was a society of open and mixed households. The home was not an isolated castle but a neighborhood focal point. The typical family was not the neat nuclear one of mother-father-children but a mixed affair of parents, stepparents, guardians, natural children, stepchildren, and wards.56 It could hardly have been otherwise, given the prevalence of illness, the frequency of early death, and the necessity of caring for the sick and orphaned; and it can be argued that in the Chesapeake region the form and strength of the social bonds were direct corollaries of the fragility of life. Finally, one can suggest an impact of disease on the culture of the Chesapeake, for while culture to an extent defines disease, the relationship is reciprocal. The associations are so tenuously perceived that questions seem more in order than statements. If there is validity in the ideal mens sana in corpore sano, then, conversely, the ill do not think clearly. Might this have been related to the low level of intellectual activity in the early Chesapeake, a level frequently contrasted to that of New England? Dr. John Mitchell's biographers, writing of his years in Urbanna, Middlesex, imply as much. "Continuous bouts of malaria . . . left him with little energy and even less joie de vivre"; and most of Mitchell's significant work was done after he removed to England.57 What would be the attitudes of a population that had a relatively high rate of illness and short life expectancy? Richard S. Dunn's comparison of New England and the English Caribbean is provocative, assuming that the Caribbean and Chesapeake were areas of high malarial morbidity. "The Caribbean and New England planters were polar opposites in social expression.... The contrast in life style went far beyond the obvious differences in religion, slavery and climate. The sugar planters 'lived fast, spent recklessly, played desperately, and died young.' . . . Their family life was broken, and since the colonists were predominantly young people without effective guidance, they behaved in a freewheeling, devil-may-care fashion.

Do the Virginians' attitudes toward death reflect the fact of frequent illness and early death? Robinson Jeffers's "patient daemon"5' was much on the minds of colonials north and south, but while the New Englanders seem to have been both enamored of and terrified by death, the Virginians appar- ently discerned death more as a matter of fact, of "dissolution" William Fitzhugh's word and of business, the willing and disposing of property.60 The comparison can only be highly tentative for little work has been done on the subject, but two vignettes are suggestive. In September i658 William Price of Lancaster County told of his last conversation with Roger Radford: ''I came into the room where Mr. Radford was sitting upon his bed sick. I asked him how he did. 'Pretty well,' he said. 'You are not, I think, a man for this world. Therefore you had best to make your peace with God and set everything to rights with Mr. Cocke.' He answered: 'No, for he is more engaged to me than I to him.' What do you give Polly Cole?' [I asked.] 'I give Polly Cole my land.' '"61 The second vignette was recorded by Philip Fithian toward the end of the eighteenth century. The sudden death of a black child "with the Ague and Fever . . . was the Subject of Conversation in the House." "Mr Carter observed, that he thought it the most desirable to die of a Short Illness. If he could have his Wish he would not lie longer than two days; be taken with a Fever, which should . . . gradually increase till it affected a Dissolution He told us that his affairs are in Such a state that he should be able to dictate a Will which might be written in Five Minutes, and contain the disposal of his estate agreeable to his mind-He mentioned to us the Substance.
