<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: CAPEK AND SELVER 7 Robert M. Philmus Matters of Translation: Karel tapek and Paul Selver Karel Capek occupies a crucial place in the development of sf, especially as the author of R. U.R. (1920). 1 The second of seven plays that he would write (three of them in collaboration with his brother, Josef), this early work made his reputation, not only in Czechoslovakia but throughout the industrialized world; and it continues to be the basis of whatever name-recognition he still enjoys outside his native country. For almost 70 years, R. U.R. was known to the anglophone world solely through its translation(s) by Paul Selver (1888-1970).2 Selver was also responsible for translating a number of other Capek titles-indeed, no fewer than ten if one includes his rendition of a book by Josef (apek as well as two of the plays that Josef and Karel co-wrote (Ze .ivota hmyzu ["From the Life of Insects," 1922] and Adam stvofitel [Adam the Creator, 1927]).3 Among these, R. U.R. is not alone in having science-fictional interest. (-apek's next-published play, V6ccMakropulos ("The Makropulos Affair," 1922; The Macropulos Secret in Selver's 1927 translation),4 though not in itself sf, can be thought of in that generic connection by reason of its sharing a conceptual basis with both R. U.R. and Tovarna na absolutno ("Factory for the Absolute," 1922-in the most readily available English translation, The Absolute at Large). Although the three have none of the usual common elements making for a trilogy, they still qualify as such (despite the fact, too, that The Absolute is a roman feuilleton, not a drama) because in each case the seminal idea corre- sponds to some one of the ultimate objectives of the medieval alchemist. Makropulos takes as its subject the Elixir of Life, a potion conferring (physical) immortality; R. U.R. the Homunculus, or artificially-produced human being; and The Absolute the Philosopher's Stone (which in alchemy is not just a talisman for transmuting "base" metals into gold, but what makes such a thing theoretically possible: discovery of the Principle, or Law, governing or underlying all matter). It is arguable (though hardly self-evident) that V6c Makropulos is in some ways the precursor of -apek's Bild nemoc (1937). The hero of this later play, Dr. Galen, is the possessor of what, in context, is something of the equivalent of the Elixir of Life: a cure for the title-featured "white plague" (or "scourge," "disease," or "sickness"). Dr. Galen's remedy is every whit as mysterious as the formula that provides the fictifactual foundation for the presence of Elina Makropulos (b. 1585) in a plot contemporary with the publication date of the play wherein she figures as prima donna. But her secret for prolonging life is magical-indeed, is the concoction of a sixteenth-century magus, Elina's father Hieronymos-whereas Galen's secret only works like magic.5 The difference in itself could be dismissed as a semantic quibble except that it marks Bfla</page><page sequence="2">8 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) nemoc as being decidedly more science-fictional than is Makropulos (the only member of its "trilogy" that does not "scientifically" update its central alchemical project-and, correlatively, the only one not set in the [near-] future). Like R. U.R., Bild nemoc is among the works for which until recently Selver in effect had exclusive English-language rights6-for Bild under the title Power and Glory (1938). Those two translations of his have something else in common as well: they have both been subjected to criticism for misrepresenting their originals. I mean to examine those charges to determine (to the extent that it be determinable) their truth. I shall start with the animadversions against Power and Glory. That inquiry, in the event, provides a basis for comparing Selver to other translators of sf and also for reflecting in general terms on how well Capek's commentators have served him. Having offered, by the way, some idea of Selver's competence, I shall then take up the case of R. U.R. Contrary to what its detractors have assumed, that first effort of Selver's at translating Capek cannot be properly appraised without taking cognizance of certain complicating factors. All of these are unique to his R. U.R. except for the most hypothetical of them, which certainly applies (according to his own testimony) to his Macropulos. Finally, I indicate the value of Selver's R. U.R. in determin- ing (at least for readers, like myself, inconversant with Czech) the meaningful similarities as well as the meaningful differences between what turn out to be Capek's two versions of this play (his revisions, which Claudia Novack-Jones's 1989 translation reflects). 1. BMU nemoc Selver's version of Bfld nemoc, (-apek's penultimate play, has been attacked as being unfaithful to the original-indeed, as being more egregiously unfaithful than his rendition of R. U.R. (or, I might add, his Macropulos). With Power and Glory Selver allegedly "reworks certain scenes [in Bild] to enable the Marshal [a bellicose dictator] and Dr. Galen [the idealistic pacifist hero] to be played by the same actor." The quotation comes from Michael Heim's preface to his own recent translation of Bfld nemoc, The White Plague (that last word being the most enticing choice among nemoc's possible English equivalents, for which see above). But while the words appear as being Heim's, he has taken them almost verbatim from Power and Glory's introductory note (probably written by Ralph Neale, the person most responsible for mounting the original English production).8 As it happens, though, that note is a fount of mis- or disinformation except as it pertains to one fact about the 1938 English staging of the play: that Oscar Homolka assumed the parts of both Galen and the Marshal. The Marshal is but one of three antagonists of Galen who serve for (:apek's personalizing of three distinct kinds of ideological opposition (the other two figuring in the confrontations between Galen and Sigelius, a scientific Bureaucrat, and Galen and Baron Krug, a Merchant of Death-primarily in Acts I and II, respectively).9 Galen vs. the Marshal, however, is clearly the most central of these, inasmuch as the play's science-fictional nemoc figures as the</page><page sequence="3">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: CAPEK AND SELVER 9 counterfoil to the Scourge of War that the Marshal all but personifies. The decision on Neale's part to have the same actor play both Galen and the Marshal in the original English production of the play therefore appears highly questionable. Beyond that, it may also seem outrageous, considering that 0-apek has clearly modelled the Marshal on II Duce and the Fiihrer with regard to both the species of Nationalism that the Marshal espouses and his conception of himself as Leader. But while the Galen/Marshal "doubling" is nonetheless not totally indefensible,'0 any defense of it would be pertinent only to Neale's production, not to Selver's Power and Glory as published. The latter in no way reflects the "doubling." On the contrary, Selver preserves the scene (II.vi) wherein Galen and the Marshal confront one another-an impossibility were the/Neale's note viridical with respect to the translation it prefaces. So, too, the ambivalence or double-sidedness of Bfld nemoc is as discoverable in Selver's translation as it is in Heim's. In either, that is, it can be perceived that the play, on the one hand, essentially stands behind Galen's scheme for setting Pestilence against War in the cause of World Peace, while on the other, it finally repudiates its longheld belief that he "can work magic" (Selver I.i.25) against the Power(s) of Death that the Marshal (along with Baron Krug) embodies.1" According to Heim's preface, "the English adapters" have turned "the play into a propaganda piece for the appeasers" of Hitler (n.p.). If, however, he is referring to Selver's actual translation, it is impossible to fathom what exactly he has in mind. There is only one difference between his rendition and Selver's that is of any consequence: that Selver has the Son (a representative of an entire generation) telling his Father, "I may not get a job ... unless there's a war pretty soon" (I.iii.30). No such line is to be found in Heim's (re)translation (or, so far as I know, in any published Czech version). But I cannot see how its presence-and with it the connection of war with the mysterious plague (afflicting only those of middle age or older) as alternative "solutions" to the 1930s' Unemployment Problem-consciously (or even subtly) evinces a Selverian perversion of the Czech original into an apology for Munich, so to speak. Indeed, it is as clear from Selver's (published) version as it is from Heim's that Bild nemoc has at its heart a tension between its idealistic pacifist impulse and its realist pessimism about the inevitability of war. Quite apart from the fact that the Selver translation's only major difference with Heim's comes down to a single line (as anyone who compares the two will discover), there is another difficulty with the charge that Selver altered the Czech to promote "appeasement": namely, that Power and Glory premiered on April 9, 1938, almost seven months before Chamberlain and Hitler (with Daladier and Mussolini as their seconds, so to speak) signed their soon-to-be- infamous Munich Pact (on September 30th). Thus, even without allowance for the likelihood that Selver began work on the translation very early in 1938 at the latest, the hypothesis that Heim invokes to explain non-existent divergencies between his and Selver's renditions of Bild must be judged anachronistic unless it be supposed that the outcome of the Four Powers Conference at Munich was simply the culmination of a longstanding policy of Chamberlain's, dating from virtually the moment he assumed the prime ministership at the very end of May</page><page sequence="4">10 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) 1937. Instead, however, Munich (as of September 30, 1938) signifies a reversal of the principles that Chamberlain as prime minister had more or less been holding to even as late as the start of the Conference (on September 26th).12 At the same time, Heim's otherwise wrong-headed invocation of the Munich Pact can be put to an instructive purpose with regard to the Marshal's plan for a blitzkrieg against an anonymous neighbor-country. Given the Marshal's resemblance to Hitler, we can safely presume that Capek has Czechoslovakia in mind as the unnamed victim. Hence the historical basis for the war taking place offstage in Bild is at least as evident now as it would have been to anyone in 1937. But the same cannot be said of the war as Bild envisions it. These days even most Czech readers might deem it purely wishful that the Marshal's armies meet a resistance that he hadn't reckoned on from the unnamed little country that he imagined would instantly provide his with Lebensraum. "Munich," however, can conduce to the discovery of what Capek was well aware of at the time he was writing BUld: that Czechoslovakia had 1,000,000 or more men under arms in defense of the equivalent of the Maginot Line, the collapse of which might have prompted the Czech forces to fight a guerilla war in terrain that would have made for at least as much of a logistical nightmare to an invading army as Afghanistan's did to the Soviets (among others).13 The same consideration now allows for an understanding of BUld's future-war scenario as a science-fictional alternative history somewhat along the lines, say, of Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle (1962) or Ward Moore's Bring the Jubilee (1953), except that in -apek's play the alternative was originally a prospect rather than retrospective-i.e., (-apek is offering an alternative to what had yet to happen rather than to the actual past. With BflU, the contingency that makes for alternative history's could-have-been is Chamberlain's sudden and total reversal, on the very last day of the Four Powers Conference, of his policy toward Czechoslovakia. The anachronistic interpretation of Bild that Heim unwittingly invites thus reveals a conceivable irony of "Munich" that is unquantifiably more bitter than that attaching to a "Peace in our time" lasting for less than a year at the outside: that Chamberlain and Daladier's betrayal of the Czechs, beyond encouraging Hitlerian aggression, ensured worldwide scope for a war that might otherwise have confined itself to Czechoslovakia. The alternate-history aspect of BUld nemoc ensuing from the news that the victim-country is offering prolonged and effective resistance to the Marshal's aggression has in any case by now been overshadowed by a science-fictional understanding of the play's nemoc that 0-apek himself cannot have had fully in mind. The mysterious plague, known as Morbus Chengi, would these days suggest itself as a premonition of HIV-AIDS or the Ebola virus. But any such analogy, apart from the fictifact about the nemoc's age-specificity that belies it, proves to be morally repugnant for a reason having to do with the datum that the disease, though resembling leprosy in its symptomatology, is "really an internal affliction""14: namely, that it expresses the spiritual-and more particularly, the ethical-rottenness of those whom it targets (viz., the middle-aged). The same consideration disqualifies two more probable candidates as the direct models for Morbus Chengi: the "Spanish" influenza pandemic that broke out worldwide</page><page sequence="5">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: CAPEK AND SELVER 11 just as "The Great War" was showing signs of ending (and that, before mysteriously disappearing, claimed fatalities whose number was some indeterminable multiple of WWI's total) or another disease that in the long run was just as deadly, tuberculosis (which in English, though not in Czech, is a.k.a. "the white plague").'5 This is not to imply that Capek was such an ignoramus about science as to have been incapable of imaginatively reworking the relevant epidemiological data. In his knowledgeability of matters scientific, he is rather closer to Wells than to Mary Shelley, but he has more of an eye to practical application over theory than Wells does. And if that is not especially evident to his English readers, the blame should fall on every one of c-apek's translators, not just on Selver. 2. Translatorial Treachery All of this is also to say that Power and Glory, as one example of Selver's work that readily allows collation with that of a subsequent translator of (-apek, fares reasonably well against its competitor. Line by line, Selver's rendering of the Czech is as often as not richer, or more forceful, than Heim's (though mostly the differences are a matter of indifference). Selver's Sigelius, for instance, in explaining to Krug the official solution for the White Plague Problem, talks of sending "[e]very suspected person ... to a closely guarded concentration camp" (11.3.62), whereas Heim has Sigelius say, "Everyone who develops a white spot will be sent to a carefully guarded camp" (38). To be sure, Heim here is more literally faithful than Selver to the Czech (which does not include a word for concentration). On the other hand, I doubt that anyone would rightly guess, on the basis of the rendition alone, which of those two English-language versions appeared in 1938 and which in 1988. In any event, however, those ignorant of Czech can profit from reading Selver and Heim side by side-a rule worth following, I think, whenever the original is linguistically inaccessible. I do not mean to deny that Selver's rendering of the Czech confirms, all too frequently, the proverbial truth of Traduttore e traditore (itself a proposition that cannot be translated without treachery to its jeu de mots). But on the evidence, say, of Power and Glory, that hardly makes Selver an egregious case among translators of whatever into English, and especially-alas-among translators of sf. This is not merely to say that those have not, for the most part, proved to be close to ideal candidates. The latter, after all, must be rather more uncommon than saints by reason of the diverse qualifications of an ideal translator, some of them mutually contradictory-e.g., that she or he should have literary talent approaching that of the author in question and be willing to suppress the ego that otherwise invariably goes along with such literary capability. Even titles comparable to R. U.R. in their importance and literary greatness have all too often found translators who, so far from meeting the ideal requirements, are hardly up to the job. Joanna Kilmartin and Steve Cox offer themselves as perhaps the most notorious example with their translation of Solaris (1970). Likely to remain well</page><page sequence="6">12 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) into this new millennium the only English version of Lem's masterpiece, it has as its basis not the Polish original but a French translation thereof (1966). Even so, Jean-Marc Jasienko's French rendering of Lem is more than competent enough to have made for a satisfactory English version-had Kilmartin and Cox seen fit to adhere to it. Instead they chose to deal freely with it in ways that their name-changes ("Harey" to "Rheya" and "Snaut" to "Snow") may serve to indicate succinctly. Meanwhile, their misrepresentations stand out from those by other sf translators only in degree of treachery. William Weaver, for instance, the much applauded translator of Calvino, all too often deviates, inexplicably, from the Italian-a practice particularly unconscionable because any reader (and a translator must first of all be that) who doesn't understand that Calvino uses language in the way poets do understands nothing of what he's about. Thus, to take an instance that is at once seemingly trivial and significant, Weaver not only misrenders a certain phrase in "Mitosis" that is arguably the hermeneutic key to both t zero (Ti con zero, 1967) and Cosmicomics (Le Cosmicomiche, 1965); he also eliminates Calvino's emphatic repetition of it when it initially appears-the phrase in question being: "un vuoto che era tutto il possibile, tutto l'altrove l'altravolta l'altrimenti possibile" (Ti con zero 71). 16 So, too, Evgeny Zamyatin's We (My, 1920/22)'7 is not particularly well-served in either of the two versions by which it is best known in English. Far more often than not, both Gregory Zilboorg and Mirra Ginsburg fill in My's ubiquitous ellipses; and while the interpretation that this involves (less pronouncedly in Ginsburg than in Zilboorg) usually does not belie the fiction's meaningful content, it does efface the stylistic Modernity-or perhaps even Post-Modernity-that makes We unparallelled in Zamyatin's other writings and nearly unique among those works that can be thought of as sf. (On the other hand, Bernard Guerney's We not only offers itself as a remedy, but must count among the few excellent English translations of any sf-and also among the hardest to come by, the volume wherein it appears having gone out of print long ago.)18 As Selver, were he guilty of everything he can rightly be accused of, would not be extraordinarily treacherous as a translator, neither would he have been serving c-apek any worse than most commentators have done. Indeed, observing that Kamila Kinyon's article in SFS 26.3 is the most insightful account in print of any work by ciapek could be (mis)taken for a back-handed compliment, given the usual quality of C(apek criticism. Apart from Kinyon's article on R. U.R. and Elizabeth Maslen's (in SFS 14.1) on the language of War with the Newts (Vdlka s mloky, 1936), there has been very little written about &amp;apek that qualifies as more than elementary, and even less that engages any fiction of his in lengthy interpretative detail. And while my judgment is based on what is available in English, the translations from Czech suggest that the same holds even for criticism in Capek's native language, or did at least up until yesterday, so to speak-which should be no surprise in view of the fact that Capek, his importance and impact on Czech literature notwithstanding, was (to put it mildly) persona non grata with the Czech Communist Party almost as much as with the Nazis.</page><page sequence="7">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: CAPEK AND SELVER 13 3. The Case of R. U.R. A defense of Selver as being no worse than many another English translator does not self-evidently apply to his R. U.R. Indeed, it might be thought entirely impertinent inasmuch as he was bringing to that first attempt at translating (-apek none of the-considerable-experience he had acquired by the time he got to Bild nemoc. Even so, had Selver been commissioned to translate R. U.R. (which the evidence suggests was not the case'9) he would not at all have been an unpromising choice. It is true that he had never translated C'apek before, but neither had anyone else-at least not into English.20 Moreover, to the extent that qualifications would have been the determining factor, Selver's should have gotten him the job even if his possible competitors could not have all fit into a call-box with room to spare. By then in his early 30s, he had a number of translations to his credit, from Russian, Norwegian, and Danish as well as from Czech.2" (In his later life he would translate from German and French, too.) He had also compiled four anthologies, at least two of which were devoted entirely to Czechoslovakian poetry; he had published a monograph in 1921 on the poet "Otakar Brezina" (the pseudonym of Va'clav Ignaic Jebavy); and he could claim to be a poet in his own right by virtue of a book of verse called Personalities (1918). In respect of the charges against his R. U. R., the extraordinary devotion to Literature that Selver's curriculum vitae, even as of 1921/22, bespeaks is more relevant than is its testimony to his linguistic capacities. Though the objectors to his R. U.R. imply incompetence, they in fact accuse him of something worse: of having "bowdlerized" (-apek's text. Bowdlerization in this instance has a meaning inclusive of, but going well beyond, its strict signification. Selver, it is alleged, not only (1) "cleaned up" just about everything in the play that might offend a Puritan's sensibility (i.e., R. U.R.'s "blasphemies," as well as its sexually risque bits); he also (2) cut a number of passages, the most obvious of them consisting of the greater part of Alquist's final oration, (3) eliminated one robot-character (Damon) by conflating him with another (Radius), and (4) redesignated "Act 3" as the "Epilogue" (and the "Prologue" as "Act 1 "). None of Selver's detractors has drawn up a complete bill of particulars. In consequence, a further would-be sin of Selver's has been virtually ignored: that he seemingly adds almost as many lines as he deletes (and not always by way of replacement). This, moreover, holds true regardless of another fact that Selver's accusers have not noted: that his R. U.R. exists in two different published versions: the American edition-originally from Doubleday but now available under other imprints (also in anthologized form), and the English, which remains the property of the Oxford University Press. A close comparison of the two with one another and with its recent English- language competitor, by Claudia Novack-Jones, reveals, first, that Selver's two versions of R. U.R. differ from one another almost exactly as much (at least in quantified terms) as either does from Novack-Jones's rendition. It soon becomes evident, too, that where Oxford departs from Doubleday (most notably with</page><page sequence="8">14 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) regard to additions and excisions rather than to local verbal details), any correspondence to Novack-Jones lies with the Oxford text. Furthermore, many of the passages peculiar to the Doubleday-but especially the (inconsistent) substitution of an American for an English phrasing (e.g., "gasoline" for "petrol," 16)-lend themselves to the inevitable inference that the American version reflects (indeed, reproduces) the script for the New York Theatre Guild (TG) production.22 The English version signally parts company with the American in renaming "Hallemeier" and "Busman" "Helman" and "Jacob Berman"23 and in making Helena the daughter of "Professor" Glory rather than of the "President" (whether of R.U.R. Inc. or of an anonymous country remains an ambiguity in the Czech). But although there is nothing felicitous about those alterations in the Oxford text, they cannot have been Selver's doing (unless, of course, one imagines that an editor at Doubleday or a TG employee looked into the Czech and restored its designations-which, to say the least, is hardly likely24). They thus lend themselves to a hypothesis that also accounts for the most important difference between the two Selvers: namely, that the American and English editions come close to parcelling out between them much of the first half of the final act (up to the point where Primus and the robot Helena appear on the scene). The Doubleday, for instance, leaves out the announcement of Radius' return from Le Havre and the considerations ensuing from that; while the Oxford eliminates the entire Robot Central Committee (in deference to Lenin?) and thereby in effect stages Alquist's decision as to which robot to operate on in Monty Pythonesque terms (particularly since Radius, now the only dissection candidate in sight, continues to ask, "why should I be chosen?" [Oxford IV.97]). So, too, the long monologue-Alquist's-that opens the final act is divided up, as it were, between the two Selvers, with very little overlap. From the foregoing, we can be all but absolutely certain of two things: (1) that neither of the translations of R. U.R. bearing Selver's name fully and accurately reproduces what he himself (initially) came up with; and/but (2) that the latter-let's call it the Ur-Selver-is largely reconstructible from the two published versions. With regard to the first three acts, the Ur-Selver would correspond to the Oxford text slightly emended to restore "Hallemeier," "Busman" and "President" Glory. Act IV, however, would involve an extensive cut-and-paste job, piecing together the Ur-Selver from the Oxford and Doubleday editions on the basis of Novack-Jones. An Ur-Selver would substantially diminish the differences with Novack- Jones. Those, however, remain numerous enough. For the first three acts, their total exceeds 150 instances, including 115 where Novack-Jones has passages (of varying lengths) not found in Selver-or vice-versa. The Oxford R. U.R.'s second act, for example, lacks 38 lines that appear in Novack-Jones but contains 21 not in her rendition, while for the first and third acts the two sets of figures are just about equal.25 Meanwhile, the charge of bowdlerizing still holds, albeit not to the extent that it does when the Doubleday text is used as the basis of judgment. The Oxford, for example, preserves some of Helena's interrogation of Dr. Gall about human sterility (11.48-49), but deletes Domin's earlier</page><page sequence="9">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: (APEK AND SELVER 15 mention of the fictifact that Old Rossum's robot-replicants have human sexual organs (N-J 1.39-40; cp. Oxford 7); and although it doesn't reduce Alquist's valedictory oration to Doubleday's two brief sentences ("Go, Adam, go, Eve. The world is yours," 187), it does omit almost everything he says after quoting Genesis-almost half the peroration, culminating in his somewhat hortative and self-echoic declaration that "life shall not perish! It shall not perish! Not perish!" (N-J 109).26 Such discrepancies between the Ur-Selver and Novack-Jones should not, I think, be entirely accountable to Selver unless and until all other explanations prove to be dead ends. In particular, it is not on the face of it likely that Selver would, with his first major translation project, have taken liberties that a translator with an established reputation might well have balked at. But by the same token, he may well have been susceptible at that point in his career to pressures to accede to the puritanical sensibilities of a 1920s' English (or, for that matter, American) audience. This last possibility turns out to be a rather more tangible factor than I, for one, suspected. The British Library (BL) holds a typescript of Selver's translation among its "Lord Chamberlain" papers. Its allocation there derives from its having been submitted to the Lord Chamberlain's Office (LCO) for the purpose of obtaining a license for the stage production; and from the correspon- dence on that matter surviving as part of the same BL collection, it is clear that an LCO bureaucrat objected to Alquist's quoting the Bible at the end of a fantasy-drama.27 In other words, the risk of offending the Puritan mindset was not just a nebulous theoretical consideration. The specter of the British Censor can explain, most notably, the omission of any reference-even in the Ur-Selver-to human sex-organs, but not the multitude of other lines missing from the Ur-Selver. Nor, of course, is the prospect of censorship pertinent to the almost equal number of passages there that are nowhere to be seen in Novack-Jones. To take two proximate instances at random: the fact that Domin speaks only in the Selver of "the deluge of these dreadful living things" (Oxford III:78) while Fabry, on the opposite page, does not add, "There is so much love in us-such an appetite for life" (N-J 88) after enunciating the dream of Alquist's building them all a house-these would surely have been matters of indifference as far as the LCO could be concerned. Such cases, however, are referrable to something (else) unhypothetical: that Selver and Novack-Jones were operating from different texts. With allowance for certain omissions partly attributable to the Puritan- Censor factor, the Ur-Selver is by and large a fairly accurate translation of R. U.R. as originally published (in November 1920, at least two months in advance of its Czech premiere on January 25, 1921). The Novack-Jones, on the other hand, more or less accurately represents C-apek's revision of his play. She doesn't trouble to specify which edition she used (though that doesn't set her apart from the vast majority of other translators of Capek or of anyone else), but it could have been any reprint of R. U.R. after 1921, the year wherein the revised Czech version came out. The differences between the 1920 and 1921 Czech R. U.R. s cover just about</page><page sequence="10">16 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) half of those between the Ur-Selver and Novack-Jones that are not chiefly a matter of (the translator's) word-choice-including all but three of Selver's supposed additions. Most notable in that latter category is the identification of the last act as R. U.R.'s "Epilogue." If, however, that heading was indeed Selver's doing, he was surely right to thus set off that portion of the play from the three preceding acts-this by reason, of course, of the surprising, though not unprepared for, change in direction that R. U.R. takes once its Last Man scenario has played itself out-even more than he was right to designate the "Prologue" "Act 1." No such credit redounds on him for the sixty-some odd lines omitted without any warrant from the 1920 R. U.R. But whether (all) those cuts were his responsibility is open to question. The deletion, for example, of a short sentence wherein Primus supplements his words to Helena-"Nobody may enter his [Alquist's] study" (IV.97)-by adding, "The man forbade it" (1920R. U.R. 91), can surely not have had a Bowdleristic motive. At the same time, instances of that sort supply the grounds for thinking that even what I have called the Ur- Selver, rather than being solely his responsibility, was a translation by committee. This, with regard to the Doubleday component of the Ur-Selver, is no mere speculation: the surviving promptbook leaves no doubt that the American R. U.R. reproduces, almost always verbatim and with few deviations of any other kind,28 the TG script (in accordance with the Doubleday volume's figuring in that publisher's "Theatrical Guild Library" series and advertising on its title- page that it is "The Theatre Guild Version"). Nor is evidence totally wanting that the Oxford R. U.R., too, is in part the work of someone who had a hand in the script of the London staging-indeed, that it is in significant part (relative to the charges against it) the work of Nigel Playfair, the actor and sometime playwright whom the Oxford volume identifies as Selver's collaborator. Moreover, the evidence I am alluding to comes from four different sources and is of three different sorts. First and simplest is the fact that Nigel Playfair enjoyed a share of the royalties from the Oxford edition-a 33 1/3% share, to be exact.29 Hence, the billing he gets on the Oxford's title-page is more than merely a pro forma bow to him for his role in preparing the script for the play's London staging; it also signals that the Oxford R. U.R. derives in part from the Ur-Selver as Playfair "Adapted [it] to the English Stage" (to quote the relevant portion of the Oxford's credit line-with the emphasis added).30 A second kind of evidence likewise points to someone else (and most probably Playfair) as having had input into Selver's translation as published, not just as staged. This evidence takes the form of two separate documents: the already-mentioned TG promptbook (indeed, two pairs of such, each consisting of a typescript and a carbon31), and a copy, now among the British Library's Lord Chamberlain's Papers, of the script submitted for government approval roughly a fortnight in advance of the play's opening at St. Martin's Theatre (on April 24, 1923). Presumably the latter script (LCP 1923/11) at least pretty much exactly represents the text of the early London performances.

U.R. nearly to the extent that the TG promptbook does to the Doubleday. On the contrary, LCP 1923/11 deviates more from the Oxford than that does from the Doubleday R. U.R., with the differences increasing (and not just in number) as one goes along-to the point where the first half of LCP's "Epilogue" is hardly collatable with the Oxford's, partly because the LCP "Epilogue" comes very close to being that of the constructable Ur-Selver (i.e., of the Oxford and the Doubleday combined). This is also to say that the differences go well beyond those dictated by the absence from LCP of two of R.U.R.'s six managers (Fabry and Hallemeier). Nor do LCP's deviations consist, as one might expect, merely of cuts. Beyond these and variant readings, LCP contains passages nowhere to be seen in the Oxford-or in any other extant version of Selver's R. U.R. There are at least seven such lines, almost half of them belonging to the "Epilogue"; and while none is in itself of consequential length or import, together they imply an Ur- Selver that was at least slightly longer-and more complete-than the Oxford and the Doubleday combined. It may not be needless to add that the lines unique to LCP-e.g., Alquist's salutation of the Robot Central Committee: "You'll whine to me again. What, are you satisfied with man now, do you think much of him, now that you cannot make Robots?" (95; cp. N-J 98)-are translations from the Czech. The TG promptbook provides supplementary evidence to the same effect. Aside from the mise-en-scene descriptions heading each act, the promptbook text rarely departs from Doubleday. The exceptions to that rule mostly concern line-assignments in the first part of the "Epilogue," which in the promptbook are more in accord with the 1920 Czech text than Doubleday's are (though "Damon" is still absent). All of the foregoing kinds of evidence give credibility to the testimony of Theresa Helbrun, one of the two principal Managers of the Theatre Guild in the 1920s (and beyond). In a letter quoted at length (and perhaps in full) by John Corbin in that NY Times drama critic's column for October 22, 1922, Helbrun avers: Before starting production, we spent an evening with two Czechoslovaks, comparing the English translation word for word with the original, and found it very accurate. There was no adaptation in this version that we received from England, and whatever changes were subsequently made were made by us in rehearsal according to the usual exigencies of production. Instead of adding to the sentimental appeal at the end, we have cut it somewhat, just as we were obliged to cut some of the bloody horror of the dissection scene that precedes it. (Corbin, "The October Stage") There's room for skepticism as to whether "an evening" (of whatever length) would be sufficient for the "word for word" verification described by Helbrun.32 Otherwise, however, her testimony squares with the independently inferrible facts, especially with regard to the TG promptbook. She thus confirms (and in some detail) what the TG promptbook's resemblance to the Doubleday</page><page sequence="13">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: -APEK AND SELVER 19 R. U.R. suggests: that most of the bowdlerizing of which Selver has been accused-at least in his R. U.R.'s American bibliographical incarnation-is instead chargeable to the TG. In this regard, moreover, one further curiosity about the LCP R. U.R. may be pertinent: that where its deviations from the Oxford involve variant readings rather than LCP-omitted lines, the LCP text frequently corresponds to the TG promptbook's/Doubleday's-which suggests that "the version [that the TG] received from England" was sent back there with the TG's alterations, and may thus have influenced the Oxford version.33 This still leaves open the question of why Selver relied on a text other than that of Capek's 1921 revision-and with it a further possibility. Common sense would suggest that he did so because the 1921 text was inaccessible to him. The 1920 R. U.R. may also have been the only text publicly available at the time Selver began his project (the outcome of which (-apek reports having seen by mid-October 1921 -see his Lidove' noviny notice, "Mr. Paul Selver"). It may be, however, that Selver was working not from the original R. U.R. as (book) published, but from either a manuscript (probably typed rather than handwritten) or the playscript for the Czech stage production. That, at least, is Helburn's testimony. In a passage from her letter to Corbin preceding the one quoted above, she averred that "the epilogue ... is a part of Capek's original manu- script" (my emphasis). That latter possibility could explain Selver's omission of portions of the 1920 text that (-apek himself cut or otherwise changed in the vicinity of the time the play opened in Prague. It could account as well for a textual peculiarity that the LCP R. U.R. shares with the Doubleday in their transposition (at least as it were) of Alquist's last valedictory sentiment. That utterance still comes from Alquist and is still prayerful ("Oh Lord, let not mankind perish from the earth"), but in both the Doubleday and the LCP it figures much earlier in the "Epilogue": at the point when Alquist emerges "terrified" from "the dissecting room" (LCP 100, Doubleday 177). Furthermore, Capek himself provides the ground for thinking that he authorized such a change. On June 13, 1923, he made a transcription of R. U.R. 's "finale," and included with it his English translation; but neither of those texts contains Alquist's last three sentences.34 The complete manuscript of R. U.R. that (miraculously) survived the war and its aftermath offers one additional scintilla on behalf of Heilbrun's claim that Selver was working from such a thing. The holograph in question, 124 pages long, is really two drafts in one (probably Capek's second and third), that by dint of its visible redactions corresponds almost exactly to R. U.R. as published in 1920.35 There is, however, one notable exception to that rule: when Domin is giving Helena the history of R.U.R., he situates Old Rossum's breakthrough in 1892 (i.e., in the past, not the future, relative to the play's original date of publication), "exactly four hundred years after the discovery of America") (Oxford I.5; cf. ms. 8). It is therefore conceivable-albeit barely-that Selver missed the Czech words for "and forty" because he was working from a manuscript wherein the computation of Old Rossum's temporal distance from Columbus hadn't been adjusted to accommodate the change from "1892" to " 1932" (in which case, Selver, if he noticed the error, may have taken it as an</page><page sequence="14">20 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) indication, like the paired names "Marius" and "Sulla," of historical ignorance on the part of R.U.R.'s managers). To the possibility that cOapek himself licensed at least some of the peculiar- ities of the (Ur)Selver R. U.R., the case of Selver's Macropulos Secret is pertinent. Billed on its title-page as the "Authorised English Translation," Selver's Macropulos takes considerable liberties with the Czech at precisely the same point as does his R. U.R.: in the final act. With Macropulos, however, Selver offers an explanation of the discrepancy: in the "Translator's Note" subjoined to Macropulos' Preface, he avers that "[tihe present rendering reproduces the author's finally revised text, which he prepared for the special purpose of this English edition" (4). Nor does the truth of Selver's word on that depend only on blind faith. Aside from the prima facie implausibility that he would have drastically altered the play on his own, his testimony gains credence from the fact that the tenor of the speeches cuts accord with -apek's prefatory defense of Makropulos against the charge of pessimism-his sensitivity about which may well have prompted him to excise, for instance, the most nihilistic of Emilia/Elina's outbursts: "People are never better. Nothing can ever be changed. Nothing, nothing, nothing really matters," etc. (Graff &amp; Jones 174; cp. Selver 203, where no such sentiments are to be found).36 But more compelling still is the fact that (apek himself proposed to a friend that the would-be French translator of Makropulos adapt the Czech version for a French audience.3 Authorized or not, even the Ur-Selver must count as a "bowdlerized" R. U.R., albeit not to the extent that some have alleged. But to what extent-or even whether-Selver himself can justly be held responsible for the bowdleriz- ing must remain largely a matter of pure speculation unless and until the manuscript of his original translation turns up. Meanwhile, his is still the only English rendition of (apek's R. U.R. as first published. It is also, I contend, superior to Novack-Jones in conveying the pathos of the interchange between Primus and Helena in Act IV. And there is even something to be said-present- ly-in favor of the Selver's defects. 4. Translational Mediation Much of R. U.R.'s meaning is evident from any of the three published English renditions. Even the Doubleday Selver makes it clear, for example, that R. U.R. identifies itself as a spinoff of H.G. Wells's The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896)-largely by way of the brief history that Domin gives Helena of R.U.R.'s progenitor, Old Rossum, a mad scientist who is decidedly Moreau- like in his materialist obsession with creating anthropomorphic life and thereby playing God (see the Oxford Selver 1.6-7, or N-J's "Prologue" 38-40). By the same token, the play, as an updating rewrite (the updating correlative to Young Rossum and then to R.U.R.'s managerial class), has the same relation to Moreau that Wells's book has to Frankenstein; so that at least indirectly, through Moreau's intermediation, R. U.R. can also be thought of as a re-vision of Frankenstein (1818/31) 38 That connection, moreover, can be looked upon as epitomizing the usual take on 0-apek's play vis-a-vis the view of Frankenstein's</page><page sequence="15">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: (2APEK AND SELVER 21 import that was predominant up until the early 1970s. R. U.R., that is to say, has mostly been interpreted as a warning about the danger(s) of Technology's becoming a Sorcerer's Apprentice (to give the point a Capekian inflection)-an understanding that, however simplistic it may be, does serve for specifying R. U.R. 's decisive influence not just on other European writers of sf, but on Americans as well (possibly from as early as 1923).39 Meanwhile, other aspects of R. U.R. 's import are unavailable in any English translation. Kamila Kinyon implicitly demonstrates as much through an incisive analysis that makes apparent for the first time (at least for those-like myself-to whom the original Czech is virtually inaccessible) the differences among Radius, Damon, and Primus. In the process, she reveals that the individuation of those Robots-a feature whose seeming paradoxicality finds its counterpart in the grounds for Helena's confusing R.U.R. 's managers with the Robot-products of their enterprise-is language-dependent to a degree that resists translation. Apart from those two extremes of un/translatability, certain meanings or nuances are more emphatically conveyed in Capek's original version, and hence in Selver's rendition thereof, than they are in the 1921 revision via Novack- Jones. So, too, for anyone unable to collate with understanding the 1920 and 1921 Czech editions, the Oxford Selver is virtually indispensable for locating -apek's revisions (vis-a-vis Novack-Jones) in order to ascertain their point. Two passages peculiar to 0-apek's first version (and thus not to be found in Novack-Jones) are particularly noteworthy. The first comes from Dr. Gall. In the course of telling Helena that "[n]othing can be done" to "restrict the manufacture of Robots" despite the evidence that "[hu]mankind will become extinct" unless that happens, Gall elaborates, mostly by way of explanation, thus: All the Universities in the world are sending in long petitions to restrict the manufacture of Robots. Otherwise, they say, mankind will become extinct through lack of fertility. But the R.U.R. shareholders, of course, won't hear of it. All the governments in the world are even clamouring for an advance in productlon, to raise the manpower of their armies. All the manufacturers in the world are ordering Robots like mad. (Oxford II.48-49; cp. N-J 68-69) Selver's is a reasonably exact translation of Gall's corresponding discourse in the 1920 Czech version (48).40 And while it is true that Gall's point is later articulated by someone else (in both the 1920 and the 1921 editions of R. U.R.)-in part by Busman and in part by Alquist-it is certainly worth repeating for its bearing on one understanding of R. U.R. (viz., as an apocalyptic satire of capitalism-more than of technophilia). The second difference worth remarking appears toward the beginning of the "Epilogue" (or Act III in N-J). In the Selver, Radius (or, in Doubleday, a Fourth Robot) tells Alquist: "We have striven with all our might. We have obtained a million million [sic] tons of coal from the earth. Nine million spindles are running by day and night. There is no more room to store what we have made" (Oxford ed. 93). The corresponding passage in the 1921 R. U.R.</page><page sequence="16">22 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) and in Novack-Jones consists of a Third Robot's two short sentences: "We have increased productivity. There is nowhere to put all we have produced" (N-J III.98). The Selver version, like the 1920 text on which it is based (83),4l gives concreteness to an abstraction. Equally importantly, however, any verboseness that the 1920 text, and hence the Selver, might be charged with cannot be extricated from the emphasis that goes with such redundancy-an emphasis that in turn has R. U.R. foreseeing one of the more memorable moments in Capek's The Absolute at Large: the moment when the "Karburators," "the Absolute's" vehicle, take over every industrial outlet (inter alia), operating all of them according to a single principle that allows "quantitative expression for ... [the Absolute's] own infinitude: over-production" (Absolute 14:119, the culminating point of the entire chapter, titled "The Land of Plenty"). The 1920 version, then-and Selver with it-makes a connection between the "post-human" Robots and The Absolute's Karburators to which a revised R. U.R. (as represented by N-J) is not privy. In excising those passages, especially, -apek downplays his original satire of capitalism run amok. Correlatively, many of the details that he adds or removes in 1921 tend to give at least slightly greater prominence to R. U.R. 's Ibsenesque-as opposed to its satiric or Expressionist (and also its melodra- matic)-aspect.42 But even so, the play's Ibsenian features would be easy to overlook also in the Czech-as they have been-were it not for Selver's (presumably unwitting) assistance. In his translation as published, the flowers that Dr. Hallemeier creates and names for Helena figure as little more than a stage prop, thanks to the elimination of virtually all subsequent references to this hybrid species of cyclamen. Helena Glory in the Selver does not repeat to herself the words "sterile flower" on the basis of Dr. Gall's having just informed her that "these flowers are ... sterile," "infertile" (N-J 69); nor, in her previous interview with Alquist, does he subliminally convey to her the suspicion that prompts her query to Gall-this, by Alquist's likening of humanity to "a sterile flower" now that people are no longer self-reproducing (N-J 65). The Cyclamen Helenae, in other words, becomes an Ibsenesque symbol, combining beauty with sterility in an ambivalent way that not only takes in Humanity's "soul" (as the source of the practically, or pragmatically,43 useless) but overrides and thus subsumes the Human vs. Robot antinomy, anticipating the latter half of what Selver terms an "Epilogue." Yet the status of Cyclamen Helenae as R. U.R.'s Ibsensian "wild duck," so to speak, becomes evident chiefly from a cognizance of the lines (as cited) that the Selver excludes. 5. Conclusion Selver's R. U.R., then, even in its most readily available forms, is far from useless. Nor is it reasonable to blame him for its defects, unless the dechristianizing of Nana's "blasphemies" be counted among those." Indeed, to attribute the shortcomings of the R. U.R. (s) bearing Selver's name entirely to his incompetence and presumption is as improbable as it is uncharitable. For one thing, it is far more likely that those published versions were the product of a committee (as it were), and that he had little, if any, control over the published</page><page sequence="17">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: CAPEK AND SELVER 23 version(s). For another, to imagine, for example, that this first translator of BIld would accurately render Galen's horrific end in Power and Glory while excising the Robots' exhortations to "Cut! Cut!" from R. U.R.'s "dissection scene" requires the assumption that Selver became more "radical," rather than more "conservative," with age. So, too, it is apparent from Power and Glory that he could do a capable job, which is the most that can be said for any of Capek's English translators (and many another author's). That, moreover, judging from his letters about as well as to Selver, seems to have been the appraisal of (capek himself (who thought his own command of English good enough for occasional publication, including an essay on R. U.R.). In short, unless and until Selver's original manuscript translation of R. U.R. turns up and proves to share Doubleday's and Oxford's bowdlerizations, there is no solid ground for dissenting from Capek's own view of Selver, evinced in their lifelong collaboration as well as by Capek's statements on the subject.45 NOTES In the course of pursuing a project that proved to be much more laborious and time- consuming than I could have imagined at its outset, I have been fortunate to have had substantial help from a number of people. Among those who have assisted me in various ways, I am especially indebted to Murlin Croucher, a Slavic Studies specialist at Indiana University Bloomington Libraries, for alerting me to relevant publications (and even providing photocopies therefrom) and for responding to my countless email inquiries; Jifi Holy, a Senior Lecturer in literature at Prague's Charles University, for directions to the mss. of R. U.R., inter alia; David Ketterer for having helped me to find (without either of us knowing that it was what I was looking for) the ms. of Selver's R. U.R. that I discuss below, and also for having acted as my surrogate in examining the British Library (BL) ancillary documents; Anne Playfair, the widow of Nigel's son Giles, for kindly permitting me both to obtain a copy of the script that the BL now holds and to reproduce a page of that; and my neighbor, Milada Vlach, for having (uncomplainingly) given hours of her time to translating (solely for my benefit) (Papek's letters and other Czech documents pertinent to my researches. My thanks also go to a small multitude of librarians as such, and particularly to Susan Brady at Yale's Beinecke Library; Kathryn Johnson and Malcolm Marjoram of the British Library; Christine Karatnytsky at the New York Public Library's Performing Arts Research Center; Katherine Salzmann at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale; and, above all, Ursula Hakien at Concordia. 1. Darko Suvin offers something of the same proposition in his essay on Capek, but extends it to cover The War with the Newts as well. See "Karel (apek, or the Aliens Amongst Us" (Metamorphoses 270-83). 2. Why I put a parenthetical "s" at the end of translation is something that I explain in section 3. 3. In the Oxford edition of Selver's translation, Ze Zivota hmyzu bears the title The Life of Insects ('And so ad infinitum'). At least some American editions eliminate the parentheses and reverse the two components. Selver's translations of Makropulos and Adam had relatively early competitors-Randall Burrell's and Dora Round's, respec- tively. Burrell is also the only exception to the rule of Selver's chronological priority: his The Macropulos Secret appeared (with that name) two years before Selver's. 4. From what (apek says at the outset of his Preface to V&amp; Makropulos (for which,</page><page sequence="18">24 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) see Selver's translation), it appears that he may have conceived of this play before R.U.R. The unanimity among English translators in rendering V&amp; as Secret is contextually justifiable; but vtc, polysemous though it is, usually has as its English equivalent "affair" or "business" or, somewhat more loosely, "case" (all three in the sense of those words that makes them roughly synonymous). 5. Selver, in fact, has Sigelius tell Galen toward the end of the second scene, "you can work magic" (Bfld as Power and Glory 25). Heim has Sigelius saying, "Your treatment is beginning to sound like a spell" (Bild as The White Plague 22). 6. A letter of 0-apek's dated July 24, 1923 raises doubts as to whether he signed over "language rights" to his work to Selver or anyone else (Spisy Korespondence No. 391, p. 202; the editor of the two volumes of Capek's letters has consecutively numbered them, and therefore I provide a page reference as well only when the epistolary evidence I am indicating figures in a multipage letter). On the question of literary rights, see also the information to which n. 29 (below) is attached. Selver's R. U.R. now has competition not just from Claudia Novack-Jones's translation (1989) but from Peter Majer and Cathy Porter's (1999) as well. The latter I take little cognizance of in this essay, mostly because I became aware of its existence only belatedly, but also because bringing it in for comparative purposes would unnecessarily complicate a discussion that must perforce be byzantine enough without it. I will observe, however, that while the Majer-Porter is at times superior to Selver and Novack-Jones in conveying R. U.R. 's linguistic energy, it has one obvious and, to my mind, serious defect: namely, that of replacing Rossum, always, with Reason. True though it is that Capek is playing on the Czech word equivalent to reason (in virtually all of the latter's meanings in English-e.g., as a synonym for motive also), that word is rozum, not rossum. Furthermore, the Czech original doubly preserves that distinction: by its English-looking subtitle, "(Rossum's Universal Robots)," and in the capital R conveying the sense that Rossum is, first of all, a proper name. To represent Young and Old Rossum as Young and Old Reason obscures this, and at the same time blatantly allegorizes a text that is not (in the original) obtrusively allegorical. Into the bargain, Majer and Porter (4) inexplicably deny Helena's father the title of "President" and instead confer a knighthood on him. 7. I indicate some of the peculiarities of that Selver below, toward the end of section 3 (and also in n. 36). 8. Although Power and Glory as published designates Neale as (if he were) its co- translator, I have no reason to believe him to have been qualified to deal with Czech. I therefore presume that a byline was something that he exacted as acknowledgment for his hand in altering Selver's translation for the stage (e.g., so as to allow for the doubling that was the English production's most notable departure from Bild nemoc). Cf. n. 30 below. 9. In Heim's translation (as in Bild nemoc as published), there are act headings to announce Galen's three chief antagonists (e.g., Act I bears the rubric "Sigelius"). 10. C:apek himself in effect provides such a defense: see 16 of the translation of his Preface to Bild elsewhere in this issue of SFS. With regard to any meeting of the opposite extremes that Galen and the Marshal personify, it is worth remarking that Heim's as well as Selver's rendition of Bfld reflects Capek's seeming underestimation of the atrocities that Hitler and Mussolini were already engaged in. I say seeming because "diplomatic" considerations-more than, say, Capek's inability to foresee Kristallnacht (or, for that matter, the Anschluss of Austria)-may have entered into Bila nemoc's portrayal of the Marshal as a Fuhrer. Hitler's displeasure</page><page sequence="19">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: CAPEK AND SELVER 25 over Vdlka s mloky (The War with the Newts, 1936) had already invaded Czechoslovakia, occasioning pressure on Capek to desist from criticizing Nazism; and into the bargain, Hitler's animosity also likely cost Capek a Nobel Prize. 11. See n. 5 above for Heim's translation. 12. As late as September 26, 1938, Chamberlain was instructing his ambassador in Berlin to tell Hitler that Great Britain would stand with France if Premier Daladier honored his country's treaty obligations to help defend Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain was thus in effect largely eliminating the shilly-shallying from his previous Commons' commitment: that "if war broke out ... it would be well within the bounds of probability that other countries [viz., England and France-and the Soviet Union] besides those which were parties to the original dispute [viz., Germany and Czechoslovakia] would almost immediately become involved." My information here, including the Chamberlain excerpt, comes from W.W. Hadley, 159-60. Like virtually everyone else who has written on the subject of Munich, he has an axe to grind. But while he surely means to exonerate Great Britain, he seems to me to offer a rather impartial and dispassionate view of Chamberlain; and his account is certainly free of the "foreshadowing" that vitiates most others. 13. Those who dismiss this alternative-history speculation may well be right, but for the wrong reason, I think. It may well be that Czechoslovakia would not have held out for long against the Wehrmacht-not, however, because its forces were pitiful, but because its General Staff would probably have been incompetent (as well as, in every sense, unprepared) to conduct guerilla warfare, the model for which would have had to be, literally, farfetched (e.g., from the Philippines). On the-considerable-disagreement among historians regarding the subject, see Telford Taylor (989-92), and, for a somewhat different view, Andrew Rothstein (74). 14. I am quoting the Selver (I.ii. 15), where these words are preceded by: "Leprosy is a skin disease." Bilu nemoc's point here is to my mind less emphatic, and perhaps less clear, in Heim's rendition: "Leprosy is a skin disease; ours is internal" (3). 15. It is possible that (-apek, who could write English as well as read it, was familiar with this piece of information. On the other hand, I, for one, was not until I accidentally came upon it in Webster's Third International. 16. The Italian, that is, speaks of "a void that was everything possible, everything elsewhere elsewhen elsewise" (in the usual-i.e., loose-understanding of "everything"). Weaver instead not only has "a void which represented everything possible" (thus separating the two); he also excises the void's triple "alterity" here, and when he does get round to inserting it (at the point where Calvino repeats it), he adds commas that rupture and thus belie its tridimensionality (i.e., after the words just quoted, he has "the complement of the fullness that was for me all, and there I was brimming over with love for this elsewhere, this other time, this otherwise, silent and void," 64). These and numerous other similar objections that I have to the Weaver translations are perhaps inconsonant (for practical reasons) with D. S. Carne-Ross's critique. Carne- Ross points to a couple of outright misrenderings by Weaver of Calvino's meaning, but mainly upbraids the English version for lacking the linguistic grace of the Italian; whereas I would ask that the latter's sense be conveyed (given that the precise qualities of Calvino's style, at least from Cosmicomiche on, are virtually impossible to translate). 17. My, or Muy (an alternative transliteration of the Cyrillic title), is often said to have been written in the year that R. U.R. was first published. Given the (fortuitous) resemblances between the two, this exact chonological coincidence would be happy enough. But while I know of no evidence that discountenances the hypothesis that Zamyatin began writing We in 1920, his completion of it in that year seems to me rather</page><page sequence="20">26 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) dubitable. Those portions of We that we would now regard as anticipating Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon (1948), for example, may have been inspired by a May 1920 speech wherein the Social-Revolutionary leader Viktor Chernov "compared socialism [i.e., of the sort he preached] with primitive Christianity and the degeneracy of the Bolsheviks with that of the mediaeval church" (E. H. Carr 175). This possible influence of Chernov supports Alex Shane's supposition that Zamyatin's writing of We extended well into 1921. In any event, Shane can, I think, be taken as authoritative with regard to the terminus ad quem of We's composition. He reports (38n) that (his friend) Gregory Zilboorg was already working on an English translation in 1922. 18. We made its first appearance in Zilboorg's 1924 translation, subsequently revised for Dutton (in 1952, the year that also saw the first Russian edition, this from New York's Chekhov Publishing House. A cursory comparison of Zilboorg's two versions leads me to suppose that his revisions all involve improvements of his English.) The Zilboorg's chief competitor, Mirra Ginsburg's version, was issued by Bantam in 1972. Bernard Guerney's translation, something of a tour de force, can be found in his Anthology of Russian Literature in the Soviet Period from Gorki to Pasternak (New York: Random House, 1960), 168-353. My spot-check of the latest rendition, by Clarence Brown, suggests that that Penguin translation, too, is preferable to Ginsburg's and Zilboorg's (and arguably to Guerney's as well). 19. To my mind, the date (October 16, 1921) of Capek's announcement of having seen Selver's R. U.R. makes it highly probable that Selver was freelancing. In view of that chronological evidence, the alternative hypothesis-that St. Martin's Theatre (probably in the person of Basil Dean, its "producer"-meaning also director-for R. U. R.) gave Selver the commission-would require the supposition that Dean sat on the translation for at least six months before delivering it to the New York Theatre Guild (whose exacting financial management dictated that a script be put in production virtually the moment of its receipt). Selver's One, Two, Three (1927- described in n. 30 below) strongly implies that his translation of R. U.R. owed its theatrical placement to a literary agent (see O1T6:88-89, 7:114-16). It is conceivable, indeed likely, that the NYTG's contract for the Selver still exists, probably among the archival materials donated to Yale close to 50 years ago. But those have yet to be catalogued; and while I came, for example, upon the time-sheets for the electricians working on the NYTG production, I couldn't find the contract in question. My ground for thinking Dean the person who dealt with the NYTG for Selver's R. U.R. (and for 7he Insect Play as well) comes from a brief letter from him to Helbrun. Although long after the fact-the missive is dated June 6, 1939-this, so far as I know, is the only document from anyone connected with Selver or the St. Martin's Theatre in the NYTG archives at Yale (or the NYPL). Why Dean (or whoever) licensed the NYTG to "scoop" St. Martin's-and by a full six months-with both of Selver's first two translations of Capek remains one of a number of Unsolved Mysteries connected with the Selver R. U.R. Conceivably the answer to that poser lies with Lawrence Langner, one of the NYTG's two chief Managers, who may have negotiated for the Selver translation when he was "Visit[ing] the Playwrights" in London and thereabouts sometime in 1922 (see ?4 of Langner's The Magic Curtain). 20. Boris Medilek's bibliography records a 1921 German translation of R. U.R. (issued by a Czechoslovakian publisher and no doubt intended, first of all, for a Sudeten German readership); and that translation indisputably antedates Selver's at least in point of publication date. 21. How Selver came to teach himself Czech (ca. 1911, not long after graduating from the University of London) is a question that he addresses himself to in the course</page><page sequence="21">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: CAPEK AND SELVER 27 of reminiscences about his dealings with literary-review editor A.R. Orage and related matters-but only briefly and in a way that is short on circumstantial detail. See Selver's Orage and the New Age Circle, 11-12. 22. Doubleday's title-page information to this effect gets additional support not only from the fact that the first Doubleday edition of R. U.R. includes four stills from the 1922 TG production, but also, and especially, from the Doubleday's correspondence to the extant TG promptbook(s)-as I later specify. 23. The whiff of anti-semitism detectable in this bestowal of a Jewish-looking name on R.U.R.'s money-obsessed manager (whose (-apekian designation seems short for the generic "businessman") is, unfortunately, not entirely out of keeping with tapek's own insensitivity on the subject-as is evident, especially, from certain details in War with the Newts (e.g., that the profit-oriented exploiter of the Salamanders/Newts, G.H. Bondy, is expressly identified as a "pimply little Jew" [1.3:30], the confrere of the Amsterdam Jewish merchants who control the pearl trade [1.4.39]-albeit those characterizations are Vantoch's). Hallemeier/Helman doesn't figure at all in the British Library typescript of R. U.R. that I subsequently refer to-i.e., presumably he was cut (along with Fabry) from the British staging of the play, with his lines parcelled out among the remaining managers. 24. We also have the word of TG (Executive) Director, or Manager, Theresa Helbrun (as quoted below) that the TG made no such changes to Selver's translation. 25. That is, the Oxford Selver lacks 8 of Novack-Jones's first-act lines and 19 of its second act's, but includes, respectively, 9 and 20 lines not in Novack-Jones. 26. But see the information to which my n. 34 is attached. 27. This was the chief objection that the LCO, in the person of G.S. Street, raised to the script as submitted. It was finally waived, but only after a face-to-face meeting between Street and Basil Dean, representing St. Martin's Theatre (where, under Dean's direction, R. U.R. was first performed in the U.K.). The relevant documents are preserved as BL's LCP Corres. 1923/4839 R. U.R. Selver fictionalizes the episode in One, Two, Three, 10:187-88; see also n. 30 below. 28. In addition to the differences I presently indicate, the TG promptbook deviates notably from Doubleday at only two other points: it transposes a brief exchange between Fabry and Gall toward the end of Act II (Promptbook 2-29); and early on in the third act it gives to Domin two short sentences that in the Doubleday come from Fabry (Prompt- book 3-3). 29. I owe this information to Anne Playfair, Nigel's daughter-in-law and heir. 30. The only testimony that Nigel Playfair offers on the subject of his literary relationship with Selver expressly pertains (only) to The Insect Play: "Mr. Paul Selver translated it for us literally, and Clifford Bax and I collaborated on adapting it" (Playfair 146). It is probable that the same m.o. (minus Bax) applied to Selver's R. U.R. as revised by Playfair for the London stage; but the differences between the surviving playscript and the Oxford R. U.R. suggest that Selver may have been involved in the latter (given the presence of lines in the Oxford not in the London playscript or in the Doubleday conjoined with the fact that Playfair didn't understand Czech). One, Two, Three, a satiric novel that Selver clearly based on his experience with getting R. U.R. staged, presents Nigel Playfair as Pye Noon, "a great advocate of the Clean Stage" (6:102-and not, of course, in the janitorial sense of clean). So, too, by that fiction's (perhaps hyperbolic) account, Selver first learned of Playfair's claim to co- authorship (and presumably, as well, of his having "adapted" Selver's translation) from reading the theater program on opening night (see OT 11:195). 31. An original and a carbon of the TG promptbook, properly speaking, are now part</page><page sequence="22">28 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) of the Billy Rose Theatre Collection at the NYPL's Performing Arts Research Library. Yale's Beinecke Library holds a textually rather similar set; but the latter-both the typescript original and the carbon copy-begin with lengthy extracts from newspaper reviews of opening night (cp. Doubleday ed. cit., ix-x), thus suggesting that these bound volumes may have been intended as presentation copies. 32. This would not be the only time that the TG undertook to have a translation verified. Philip Langner, the TG's current President, told me that in 1965 or thereabouts he had someone hunt up the Russian original of Leonid Andreyev's He Who Gets Slapped and translate it for the purpose of ascertaining the accuracy of the translation that the TG already had in hand (probably a holdover from its 1922 production, which was also the year of the play's appearance in Russian). This, moreover, may have been a matter of paternal inheritance: Lawrence Langner, Philip's father, was the other principal Manager (along with Helbrun) of the TG from its inception until the mid-1950s; and he may also have been the person responsible for negotiating a contract for R. U.R. (see n. 19 above). It is also worth mentioning that Mary Fox's reason for doubting Helbrun's testimony (105) has as its basis a misreading of the evidence she adduces: Corbin's column for Nov. 5, 1922, in the course of which he describes an ending wherein a woodcutter's wife appears, babe in arms. Fox takes this to be an account of the TG's R. U.R.; but, unfortunately for her argument, Corbin is instead talking about the final scene of The Insect Play, which he is comparing with R. U.R. 's in point of their Capekian "optimism. " 33. Whether Helbrun or Langner sent the TG playscript back to London for approval or merely on an FYI basis I don't know. But there is little room to doubt that Dean and Playfair had the TG version, probably well in advance of Dean's submitting the St. Martin's text for LCO approval. In fact, the LCP R. U.R. corresponds to the TG promptbook at so many points where LCP departs from the Oxford that it is tempting to suppose that the R. U.R. that Dean submitted to the LCO was the TG version. Apart, however, from the unlikelihood that Dean would have risked the consequences of being found out, several features of the LCP R. U.R. preclude his having done so. Beyond the absence from LCP of Hallemeier and Fabry and its renaming of Nana as Emma, LCP in a number of places has readings peculiar to the Oxford edition (as opposed to the TG promptbook/Doubleday R. U.R.). 34. The relevant document-a missive (with enclosures) to Edward Marsh, dated June 13, 1923-is now a possession of Southern Illinois University, Carbondale's Morris Library (ref. VFM 185). It comprises, inter alia, Capek's own translation of the "End of R.U.R. (suppressed in the English version)," that reads as follows: "Now, Lord, dismiss thy servant, thy most useless servant Alquist! Rossume [sic], Fabry, Galle [sic], all great inventors, what great invention have you made compared with this girl, this boy-the first couple who invented love, crying, laughter, the smile of love, the love of man and woman? Nature, Nature, the [sic] life will not die out! God, the life will not die out! Comrades, Helene [sic], the life will not die out! It will be again, begun from love, begun naked and very small; it will take root in a desert, &amp; what we have made &amp; built will be as nothing to it, nor will the towns &amp; factories, nor our art, nor our ideas, &amp; yet it will not die out! Only we have died. The houses &amp; machines will decay, the systems will fall to pieces &amp; the names of the Great will wither like leaves; only thou, Love, will blossom on the ruins &amp; pass the seeds of life to the winds." (I am grateful to the SIU Morris Library's Katharine Salzmann for supplying me with a copy and for SIU's kind permission to transcribe it here.) 35. The ms. is now in the archives of Prague's Pamatnik Narodiho Pisemnictvi, whose director (Dr. Nad6zda Macurova) obligingly furnished me with a photoreproduc- tion. Though the last ms. page bears the number " 122," that total needs adjustment to</page><page sequence="23">MATTERS OF TRANSLATION: -APEK AND SELVER 29 take into account one unnumbered page and another, intercalated, that bears the designation "7a. " Even the portions of this ms. that Capek has excised cannot be his first draft by reason of another (-apek ms. of R. U.R. in the same archives. Consisting of twelve consecutive pages of Act III, this fragment corresponds to no published version and is undoubtedly anterior to the Act III of the complete ms. 36. In addition to excising a number of sentences that various characters (Vitek, Gregor, Emilia/Elina) utter in the original, Selver's Macropulos conflates Act III's two scenes, allowing Emilia/Elina two minutes rather than thirty to prepare for her "trial," at the same time eliminating any trace of her drinking problem (representing her, in effect, as a narcoleptic instead of an A.A. candidate). Curiously enough, Randal Burrell had already done pretty much the same thing. And so had Leos Janacek in his role as librettist (as well as music composer) for his twentieth- century opera masterpiece V&amp; Makropulos (1926). Janacek, moreover, would have needed Capek's permission to use Makropulos-that conceivably extended to the conflation of Act III's two scenes (and possibly also to the cutting of that act-far more drastically than in the Selver version); and hence Janaek's example lends credence to Selver's claim of having been authorized to alter Makropulos as he did. 37. The letter in question (Spisy No. 391, p. 201) bears the date, July 24, 1923. An Oct. 4, 1924 note from Capek to Selver (Spisy No. 721) is also pertinent inasmuch as it implies that Capek has sent his translator a (hand-)revised text of Anglick;ch listu (Letters from England, 1925). 38. More than one reviewer of the TG premiere made the comparison. Corbin's New York Times notice, for instance, was headed "A Czechoslovak Frankenstein." 39. Dragan Klaic in effect proposes Elmer Rice's play The Adding Machine (1923) as a product (in all likelihood, the earliest) of -apek's putative technophobia-this in the course of Klaic's modifying such an understanding so as to make R. U.R.'s "menacing prediction" consequent upon "human attitudes" rather than upon "technology as such" (80-84). The chronological proximity of the Rice to the English-language debut of R. U.R. might be thought to militate decisively against Capek's influence were it not for the fact that Rice's (insider) connection with the TG antedated its contract for The Adding Machine (that had its premiere in the same TG season as R. U.R.). 40. Dr GALL: Vsechny university sv6ta zadaji takhle velkymi memorandy, aby se omezila vyroba Robotul; jinak pry-jinak lidstvo zadje na neplodnost.

Neni uz kam dat, co jsme vyrobili. Vgude na sv6t6 se stavi domy. These and other readings peculiar to the 1920 R. U.R. are recorded (though not comprehensively or with total accuracy) in Spisy VII, 417-27 (as I belatedly discovered, with the help of Murlin Croucher). Also to be found there is a schedule of the textual variants (all of them minor) in editions after 1921. 42. (2apek removed much of the melodrama of his 1920 version by eliminating from its third act a good many lines having to do with what might be characterized as the action-movie aspect of the fight against the Robots-beginning with the excision of Domin's "If they were to lean against the railing it would snap like a matchstick" and Gall's response, "H'm, they aren't armed" (Oxford 62; 1920 R. U.R. 59). In regard to (apek's Ibsenian symbolism, there is a feature unique to the TG</page><page sequence="24">30 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) production that must count as preternaturally apropos (unless the TG had Selver's complete translation of R. U.R.): the stage direction [Doubleday 183] for Helena R. to put a (real) flower-a rose-in Primus's hair. More curiously still, however, that stage direction does not appear in any of the extant TG promptbooks. 43. Although Capek was attracted to Pragmatism in his student days in Paris-making it the subject of his dissertation-R. U.R. and later works of his offer reason to think that he subsequently developed a critical/satiric view of the pragmatic outlook (at least with a small p). 44. I incline toward the opinion that Selver himself may well have been responsible for this particular species of bowdlerization, not by reason of his possessing a puritanical sensibility or from the usual kind of consideration of his audience (and readership), but because he would likely have realized that for a Jew (like himself) to give an accurate rendition of Nana's Christian expletives would be to invite critical comment, if not social ostracism. As for Selver's own propensities, the still living relative of his who knew him best (Mrs. Gideon Selver, now Mrs. Vashanti Rogers) epitomized his attitude(s) as "anti- establishment. " 45. The two volumes of Capek's Spisy (i.e., "Works") containing his correspondence include 29 letters to or about Selver; but most of these are from the 1920s and few offer anything substantial. One exception to that rule, a November 5, 1924 letter to Selver (Spisy Korespondence No. 728), speaks of "minor misunderstandings" in Selver's translation of Letters from England; and shortly before that, Capek sends an apologetic note to Mr. Seton-Watson for a translatorial mistake evidently occasioned by Selver's not being privy to some detail or other about that man's wife. But in that same letter he refers to Selver's as an "otherwise perfect translation"; and early in the following year, he confesses to his friend Dr. Tatosi: "I must admit that only now I bow to Mr. Selver's translations" (letter of January 29, 1925, Spisy Korespondence No. 1294, p353). Otakar Vo6aldo, who was monitoring (apparently on his own initiative) Capek's business with his English translators, is critical of Selver only for financial and suchlike reasons (he alleges, for example, that Selver cost (-apek both London theater and U.S. film contracts: Votaldo 46). Perhaps more telling than the absence-from both Capek's letters and Vocaldo's commentary on some of them-of any expression of major dissatisfaction with Selver's renderings, let alone any serious misgivings about Selver's competence, is the fact that Capek permitted Selver, repeatedly, to represent him to the English-speaking world-indeed, on more than one occasion invited him to do so (e.g., in an August 4, 1924 letter asking Selver to [re]translate Makropulos [that had already been translated by Burrell]-see Spisy Korespondence No. 719). Unfortunately, none of Selver's letters to Capek appears to have survived. No doubt they were among the documents that C-apek's wife, Olga (nee Scheinpflugova), hastily destroyed soon after his death (on Christmas day 1938) to keep them out of the hands of the Nazis.

ABSTRACT Paul Selver has frequently been attacked since the late 1980s for his treachery as a translator-particularly with reference to his renditions of two of Karel C.apek' s sf plays, R. U.R. (1920/2 1) and Bila nemoc (1937). But Selver's translation of the latter, as Power and Glory, shows him to have been as competent as most other translators, especially of sf; and this in turn reopens the question of whether he indeed bowdlerized R. U.R. That inquiry conduces to the discovery of evidence (mostly pertaining to a typescript now in the British Library) suggesting that neither of the two different editions of R. U.R. bearing Selver's name, even when combined, represents his original work-that both "Selver" R. U.R. s were translations by committee, as it were. Nor can he fairly be charged, as he in effect has been, with unfaithfulness to the second, revised edition of R. U.R. (1921), given that he was working either from the original published Czech version or from what one witness calls a "manuscript." Meanwhile, the defects of the Selver, although not certainly ascribable to him, prove instructive with regard to perceiving the meaning of Capek's play.</page></plain_text>
