<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph Halpern Sartre's Enclosed Space "II est seul dans le decor" (L'Age de raison) Nothing is more consistent in Sartre's fiction than use of decor as an active and signifying element of composition. Blinding sunlight, burning, lucid skies, open roads of adventure, dark, narrow streets, shuttered rooms, gaping wounds and mouths, pasty flesh, scuttling crabs and vermin, syrupy air, female swamps, lurking invertebrate Beasts, creeping Vegetation, chocolate walls of Nausea, and the "walls of Absurdity and Destiny" dominate his novels. With their appropriate Gestaltist adjectives, 1 they shape a world that can be recognized and reconstituted from text to text: "an embodiment of the world, ensanguined, luminous, sullen, passionate, sinister, full of hopes, an image populous with houses and gardens, tall delightful girls and horrible insects." 2 The organization of Sartre's literary space has often been accounted for within the bounds of his own ideas. One can list those concepts as they press forward to suggest themselves to the critic, like the "time-tested philosophies" that discreetly offer their consoling services to Mathieu at the conclusion of The Age of Reason. There is the invocation of Bachelard's name toward the end of Being and Nothingness, accompanied by the analysis of the objective qualities of 1 The term is used by Roland Barthes in Critical Essays (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1972), p. 17, in the sense of totalizing, singular. 2 Jean-Paul Sartre, The Age of Reason, tr. by Eric Sutton (New York: Knopf, 1959), p. 56.

Since all acts, according to Sartre, are to understood by their projection into the future, the figuration of landscape and decor in his novels of the 1940s also leads to concepts he has used more recently: the practico-inert, seriality, le vecu, etc. The most useful of these later terms probably is scarcity (rareti), which "designates the fact that the natural milieu is hostile," that "life on earth is improbable," and that there "is not enough for everyone." 3 But all of these signposts lead us in the same general direction. There is little real disagreement about what Sartre means to do with the world he portrays in his novels. The "mousetrap" of situation, the magic of emotion, as it transforms the world, as it creates an "individual affective universe," inseparable from the characters of the novels and their changing perceptions, 4 the phenomenological sense of the expressiveness of objects, of the way in which they are revealed by states of consciousness, 5 the density and "resistance" of objects and the emptiness behind them, all of this is clearly enough presented and demonstrated in the novels and stories as to be beyond serious debate. 3 The definitions are from Le Socialisme difficile (Paris: Seuil, 1967) by Andre Gorz. The second group of terms may be found in the Critique de la raison dialectique; the first is taken from the period of Being and Nothingness. I would have to demonstrate the unity of these concepts were I not limiting myself in these first paragraphs to the way Sartre intends to use them. For him there is no break in his thought.

The characters of the novels themselves, imbued as they are with mauvaise foi, rather haplessly expect the landscape to mean something. Daniel Sereno, in The Age of Reason, wants to make the landscape responsible for him and for his separation from the society of just men: "Something in this sky, in this light, in this display of nature, had thus decided . . .. At the merest sign these men would fall upon him and tear him to pieces. And the sky, the light, the trees, the whole of nature would be, as always, in league with them" (p. 176). He looks with envy upon one of their number: "A reverent soul. Beyond that, responsive to the great natural forces, heat, cold, light, and moisture." In Nausea, Roquentin hopes to find in the fog of Bouville some coincidence of nature and his personal adventure, and for Mathieu, in Troubled Sleep, "the earth and the sky were full of signs." 6 But the cosmos refuses, of course, to make this kind of sense for long. Even when buoyed up by narrative anthropomorphism or by Proustian pastiche ("round" silences, the "blond" silence of the street), pathetic fallacy is an illusion sooner or later dismissed by Sartre's lucid protagonists: "These four walls and that woman on the bed were an unimportant accident, a transitory vision of the night.... Four timber partitions had been set up no matter where. Mathieu was no matter where." At any moment the accidents of decor can dissolve: "there was no war, no Czechoslovakia, and no Mathieu; only that soft warm pressure round her shoulders." 7 For the charcters, decor and landscape, the names unfold in the text of Nature, can only be illusory in the long run. The poetic (and childlike) act of naming is impermanent; Mathieu's name is inscribed on the night only to be washed away with the morning tide. Around each character lies a trembling, warm, opaque atmosphere, the presence of the Other, that takes shape and consistency in meanings that soon are lost. But if this is true for Mathieu and Roquentin, for the reader, beyond its mimetic function, beyond the presentification and irrealiza- tion of our world, beyond its "hyper-naturalism a la Zola," Sartrian space is regulated by an internally coherent system of meaning. 6 Troubled Sleep (New York: Knopf, 1960), p. 49. 7 The Reprieve (New York: Knopf, 1966), pp. 378, 396. 60</page><page sequence="4">Joseph Halpern Sartrian decor is analogical and summatory, and, moreover, because it is not only an "effet de reel," predictive. It functions as a significant organizing device, a mise en abyme that repeats and condenses the message at moments, at others anticipates and generates interpreta- tion. Sartre would say it totalizes: represented space inscribes within itself multiple reference to all other elements of the text; it is symbolic of the entire message of the novel in the way that each act can be symbolic of an entire man. It is motivated, that is, produced according to a model that, as Fredric Jameson has pointed out for Sartre's criticism, negates the "basic specification of semiology": "namely, that the relationship between signifier and signified be an arbitrary one . ..." By contrast, the relationship between the various series in Sartre's mode of interpretation must be described as symbolic; which is to say that their relationship is precisely not arbitrary, but that in some fashion each series reflects and contains within itself all the others." 8 Nothing has been more discussed in Sartre's fiction than this fore- grounding, labeling, indexing of space. He is, after all, the author of Le Mur, La Chambre, Huis clos, Les Chemins de la libert6 and Les Sequestres d'Altona, as well as Bouville's rue de Mutiles and its dark, eastern tramway-stop, Abattoirs-Grands Bassins. The signs are hard to miss. Barthes claims that the organization of literary space is "the last bastion of our traditional art of writing," 9 and there is undoubtedly an important dose of convention-both affirmed and negated-present in the way Sartre uses the landscape. For one thing, he is playing, as Beckett will, with the topography of the quest romance. Another reason for the process is his opposition to the ambiguity of "poetic prose." According to his theoretical statements of the time (in Situations I and II), he is attempting, in his novels, to minimize the digressive aspect of description and to concentrate all facets of the text in one direction. Description should not be, therefore, a lyrical diversion, it ought not to aim at adding resonance, "vague harmon- ics," suggestion and illusory depth; it should instead reinforce clearly 8 Marxism and Form, pp. 224-25. 9 Critical Essays, p. 23. 61</page><page sequence="5">Yale French Studies designated denotations, and underscore rather than extend the intended sense of the narrative sequence. To this end landscape and decor in Sartre's novels are consistently schematized. Polysemanticity is resisted to the degree that insertion into a system privileges a first meaning and establishes a hierarchy and a limitation of interpretive possibilities. The Roads to Freedom involves not just the spatialization of history, but the arranging (Heidegger: Einraumen) of that space: "Roads open up space and organize it." 10 "Il est seul dans le decor.... Seul dans la nuit." 11 Man struggling for form in a shapeless world, man alone in indifferent nature-the meaning of these elements does not reside in the vague overtones of a post-Romantic, post-Pascalian Gestalt, but is pinned down, given semantic distinction, by systematization, by the constant process of antithesis. In spite of the disconnectedness of events, in spite of the impossibility of the human situation, the space of Sartre's text is not conceived of as an open one of uncertain meaning, but rather as a structured accretion of signs that can be interpreted, which the text itself interprets, and which constitute part of the text's (reductionist) self-interpretation. Sartre's space is ideally the space of enclosure, and not because the closed room is his favorite image, generated by obsession or ideological commitment. Enclosure, which haunts his characters in their search for meaning, can be understood here as an impulse toward unity and system-building. Sartrian fiction, conceived of as a vehicle of communication, develops the concepts of enclosure not only to concretize man's isolation and the meaninglessness of existence but also as an element of textual space linked to the conditions of unambiguous communication. Continuity and discontinuity are the basic poles of Sartre's world. In a number of texts, he has linked continuity to self-enclosure and passivity, and discontinuity to openness and revolutionary explosive- 10 0. F.

One is the world of active commitment; the other, the indecisive world of passivity. This dichotomy is particularized through the dialectics of inside and outside. Brunet, the Communist, may have locked himself into a mental "prison without bars," forgotten his freedom for l'esprit de serieux, but he is committed to action and so it seems to Mathieu that he brings with him "an air of out of doors, a whole healthy universe, an abrupt and stubborn world of revolt and violence, of manual labor, of patient effort, and of discipline: he would not be interested in the shameful little bedroom secret that Mathieu was about to confide to Sarah" (p. 48). The outside world that Brunet embodies ("he reached across the whole earth, suffering and struggling with the proletarians of all countries" [p. 155]) appears to Mathieu as a masculine world of form, of true colors and dense shapes. In relation to Brunet and his world Mathieu feels less than a man- "There Mathieu was, confronting him, undecided, half his life gone, and still half-raw" (p. 154)-in the same way that earlier in the novel a young child looking at Mathieu had seemed not yet altogether human, not quite formed: "the little creature had not long emerged from a womb, as indeed was plain: there he was, undecided, minute, still displaying the unwholesome sheen of vomit" (p. 54). The world that dominates The Age of Reason is the world of the interior, an impure world of secrets and shame, a world of flow lived "between parentheses," "a la petite semaine." 13 As every reader of 12 See my Critical Fictions: The Literary Criticism of Jean-Paul Sartre (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976), pp. 86-89. What I discuss in general in the book as a masculine/feminine polarity could just as well have been termed discontinuity/con- tinuity: "We apprehend here . .. the polarity of the continuous and the discontinuous, the feminine and masculine poles of the world." (Being and Nothingness, [New York: Washington Sq. Press edition, 1966], p. 766.) 13 Sartre's male characters, in his novels and plays, might be divided into those who fascinate women and those who do not. Those who do are in some sort absolutists, or they dirty their hands and acquire massiveness; those who do not fascinate women are "mediocre" types (the term can be traced back from The Age of Reason to "L'Ange du Morbide," his first story), talkers, lyc&amp;e teachers, Sunday painters, those who do not leave for isles of adventure, who live "a la petite semaine." When Mathieu steals Lola's money, when he takes one step toward an irrevocable act, there is a noticeable awakening of interest in him among the female characters. In The Age of Reason, Mathieu's possi- bilities also lie between being a "type foutu" and a "type en or." 63</page><page sequence="7">Yale French Studies the novel has observed, Mathieu and friends move through a series of enclosed spaces (rooms, taxis, club, cafe, garden, museum) that are conveniently color-coded. Each room has a particular symbolic color and quality of light (green for freedom, purple for indecision) and the development of the story could be plotted on a color chart: "A long, straight street. Behind him, in a green room, a little malevolent consciousness obdurately repulsed him. Before him, in a pink room, a motionless woman awaited him with a smile of hope" (p. 34). 14These rooms are echoed by symbolic enclosures-the womb, the shell that surrounds each character, the masks they all wear, life perceived as destiny, the logical trap of mauvaisefoi-and each character embodies a spiritual enclosure, a limited set of responses and possibilities, a recoverable mental pattern and rhythm and a "linguistic egoism." In this world, everyone is caught in the mousetrap, "fait comme un rat," as Sartre likes to say, and the idea of breaking out runs through the novel. Knives, razors, surgical tools, self-inflicted wounds, "le regard," Mathieu's "toothless life," mouth and eye as openings in plaster masks, lips and tongues as nudities that vomit horror, hands seeking contact, the wound that opens like a mouth in Mathieu's hand and to which Marcelle presses her lips, all link the concept of breaking through, dichirure, to pain. There will be no way out here, no "'issue. -15 What makes The Age of Reason a novel of extreme situations is neither its sensationalism nor its historical setting, but rather the fact that it concerns itself with people who are slipping into middle age. The age of reason is the age of resignation, says Mathieu, the age of responsibility, of frozen attitudes (une grande personne, un bourgeois, un monsieur, un chef de famille) and lost illusions, the end of freedom and disponibiliti. The novel is organized around a group of characters (Mathieu, Daniel, Lola, Marcelle) all trying to hold on to their youth by attaching themselves to the young (Boris, Ivich, the 14 See John Vernon, The Garden and the Map (Urbana: The University of Illinois Press, 1973), for a discussion of map structure in the novel, at stake in the quotation above, and discreteness (segregation, polarization). 15 See Kenneth Douglas, "Sartre and the Self-Inflicted Wound," Yale French Studies, no. 9 (1959), pp. 39-51.

"Between thirty and forty, people bet on their last chance (p. 208) . . . after thirty a man's dead" (p. 238). The thematic and represented enclosures of the novel are reinforced by rigid textual compartmentalization. Each chapter is clearly marked into segments by changes in the point of view, as we jump abruptly from Mathieu's world to Daniel's, from the rue Sebas- topol to Marcelle's room. The feeling of disjunction that results is generally thought to represent the Sartrian theory of time as rupture, but in The Age of Reason the progression of time is so linked to shifts in the focus of narration that it seems more to create a sense of space as rupture. The atomized Cartesian passage from moment to moment becomes a leap from place to place-a dislocation. Within each segment and chapter, there is also a striking insistence on closure. Each segment opens and closes a complete narrative sequence. Each chapter conveys a distinct sense of self-sufficiency, stability, and coherence, and endings are clearly marked. This tech- nique, which both adds to and negates the general sense of rupture within the narrative flow-"a rent (dechirure) . . . in the web of words" (p. 194)-is taken up by the fashion in which the novel as a whole strains toward closure. The impersonal summation of the final paragraph, the conclusion that Mathieu's life is a failure, and the "natural" ending of the day in a solitary moment of contemplation and fatigue work with the pairing of contrasting parallel scenes at the beginning and end of the novel, and the tying together of all of the loose strands of the action, to seal the text. The last words of the novel ("It's true, it's really true: I have attained the age of reason [p. 397]) use the title as a mark of finality and conclusiveness and establish one last guarantee of meaning, stamped with veracity: the title was indeed appropriate; the book means what we thought it meant. Mathieu has finished with his youth and his questions-"Are the stakes all set?" [Est-ce que les jeux sont faits?](p. 6)-seem to be answered: "he would not change: he was as he was made" [ii &amp;taitfait](p. 397). What is more, despite the fact that The Age of Reason is only the first volume of The Roads to Freedom, we are offered a self-announced conclusion in the grand manner-a conversion. Couched in the terms of Rene Girard, we have the "renunciation of metaphysical desire," preceded 65</page><page sequence="9">Yale French Studies by the repudiation of the mediator (Ivich), which implies the renunciation of divinity, pride and slavery: "Deception gives way to truth, anguish to remembrance, agitation to repose, hatred to love, humiliation to humility, mediated desire to autonomy, deviated transcendency to vertical transcendency." 16 Mathieu embraces solitude; his defeat would seem his salvation. But Sartre is not Dostoievsky. While it is true that Nausea and The Words end in conversions, and that Sartre is strongly drawn to the form and the idea of conversion, to read the last paragraph of the Age of Reason as a victory would be to fall into a rather crude trap. In the final lines of the novel, it is principally the landscape that operates a conversion, that announces an end to illusion and the celebration of illumination and rebirth: "Mathieu walked up to the window and drew the curtains. It was a lovely night, a lovely blue night; the wind had swept the clouds away, the stars were visible above the roofs.... It was a sky for a village fete, sparkling with ribbons and rosettes, redolent of holidays and dancing in the open air" (pp. 396-97). One's first impulse is to try to recuperate the very conventionality of this final- moment imagery by reading in it signs of what Wayne Booth calls "stable irony": the staleness of the convention in itself would then call for an ironic reconstruction, a reading against the clearly designated sense. We comprehend that Mathieu's new-found tranquility does not mark an authentic conversion because the text has already made us wary of pathetic fallacy, because, on the level of this kind of manipulation of symbols, Mathieu closes the window and goes to bed (and because we have read the volumes that follow). But it seems more likely that this blatancy entails only a step backward from the subtler ambiguity of the conclusion: the clouds of illusion are not swept away here in a complex act of ironic self-reflection but rather by the conventions of the genre, by the pressure of closure alone. What irony there is does not devolve from the text's self-awareness as convention, but more simply continues a misunderstanding the text has already 16 Rend Girard, Deceit, Desire and the Novel (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1965), p. 294. 66</page><page sequence="10">Joseph Halpern deflated. Mathieu may have freed himself from a false situation and learned something about the "impertinence of circles," 17 but his defeat is not yet his salvation. We await his resurrection in volume 4, La Derniere Chance. Decor is not redundant in this instance, but narrowing and misleading: the force of convention traps the reader in Mathieu's enclosure. The clear sky and bright stars are not signs of resolution, but of false closure, because the most important of the questions raised in the novel-the definition of freedom and its relation to commitment- have not been answered, and Mathieu is neither saved nor damned. The distorted theological decor of The Roads to Freedom, the dazzling illumination of this world without a judge, is, like the theological vocabulary of Nausea, or the images of Christ in The Age of Reason, a form emptied of content, a blind alley and nothing more. If closure breaks up the text internally and yet supports a general sense of coherence, repetition, then, creates openings between disjunctive elements of the novel, and privileges a first meaning, subordinate to a coherent general scheme of interpretation, while suggesting a second; repetition systematizes the process of making sense in The Age of Reason. Each of the parallel sets of characters- Mathieu-Ivich, Lola-Boris, Daniel-Boris, Daniel-Ralph, the middle- aged homosexual and the blond youth-repeats the gestures of the others. They are all linked by the image of the game of chance, in which the older characters are making their last desperate wager. Daniel thinks of Boris as his last chance, then says the same of Marcelle and her unborn infant, but Lola also says it of Boris ("That kid is my last chance" [p. 250]) and Mathieu, too, has "set all his hopes upon a child" (p. 330). Moreover, beyond the repetition of obviously "meaningful" phrases-"Je suis entierement libre" [I'm quite free](p. 54, et passim)-the precise reiteration of "natural" dialogue not 17 Joseph McMahon, Humans Being (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1971), p. 123. The joke is still on Mathieu in the last paragraph; this is not his space except insofar as we see it as one of those "humble little joys" and "passing favors" that the world reserves for its types foutus, "on condition that they enjoy them with discretion" (p. 298). 67</page><page sequence="11">Yale French Studies apparently camouflaging an existentialist vocabulary-"Vous etes un type en or!" [You're a great guy!](p. 270, et passim)-lends itself to a sense of continuity as contamination which is present throughout the novel. What Boris says to Mathieu, Mathieu says to Sarah, and so on. And although the question is complicated technically by the use of discours indirect libre, even the narrator is caught up in this verbal enclosure. In spite of the distinction between the narrative rhythms and modes of thought of each character, the narrative voice at insignificant (subconventional) but recuperable moments becomes an echo that links them. In spite of an entire system oriented toward the primacy of the subject, the neatly separated characters of The Age of Reason flow together. Despite everything, as Blanchot has pointed out, the novel is composed from Mathieu's point of view. Enclosure through repetition coexists with an open, intersubjective verbal space: we are in the inherently ambiguous realm of what Bachelard called the "Half- Open": the Door. (One thinks, of course, of the door in No Exit that Garcin will not pass through, but also of Marcelle's squeaky door: the ambivalence of Sartre's doors is the ambivalence of bad faith.) Opening and closing are in themselves focal points of ambiguity. Through transposition (intertextuality) the novel also opens onto the system of the entire Sartrian oeuvre, both past and future. In addition to the clearly established connections to Being and Nothingness and Sartre's earlier philosophical writings, to his plays and to Nausea (the Sunday museum scene), one could easily outline in the novel a network of references to Baudelaire, Proust, Flaubert, Gide and Genet, as Sartre has portrayed them in his critical works. When Mathieu imagines himself rocked by "fine surgical hands" (p. 297), he is expressing a Flaubertian obsession that will be discussed in precisely this language in L'Idiot de la famille; when his penis becomes a "guilty flower" (p. 18) or when the world of objects groups itself in a circle around him, we are looking forward to Saint Genet. 18 The procedure extends to unsystematic, isolated citation that may or may 18 Baudelaire, too, is one of the presences most strongly felt in The Roads to Freedom, both in terms of specific reference and as he represents an attitude and a social 68</page><page sequence="12">Joseph Halpern not be fully decipherable within the codes of the text. For example: "The room was behind him like a placid sheet of water, only his head emerged above the water, the insidious room was behind him, he kept his head above water. . ." (p. 160). Keeping one's head above water is a perfectly clear concept and within this novel it makes sense in terms of the viscous threat embodied by Marcelle and the engulfing sexual wave ("une onde pateuse") that sweeps over Boris when he is with Lola, and in this instance because Mathieu is leaning out on a balcony. Mathieu is "so weary of being tossed about among conflicting currents" (p. 283) that he feels that all he has to do is to let himself go. But the expression "tenir la tete hors de l'eau" is found in Baudelaire and Saint Genet and suggested in L'Idiot de la famille in similar contexts; it can be linked through them to resistance, explosion, precision, action, commitment, transcendency, self-definition, vital- ity, flexed muscles, clenched fists and erect, upright posture as one part of a system which opposes these concepts to passivity, submission, resignation, irresponsible floating, drowning as a feminine form of death, suicide, cowardice, "negative verticality" and time as flow. 19 The expression opens beyond the text only to be inserted into a vast but equally controlled system of meaning. To "situate" the text is to expand its possibilities within definable limits. The space of The Age of Reason, which seems to take on value only through the perceptions of the characters, is situated within an englobing Sartrian space that defined its meaning a priori. Water, which symbolizes freedom to one condition for Sartre. Even in The Words, which is not contemporaneous with Sartre's Baudelaire, when Sartre speaks of God as an old flame-once there might have been something between us but now it's over-we are reminded of Baudelaire's prose poem "Le Joueur gdnereux," where the Devil says of God: "Nous nous saluons quand nous nous rencontrons, mais comme deux vieux gentilshommes, en qui une politesse inn&amp;e ne saurait 6teindre tout a fait le souvenir d'anciennes rancunes" [We greet each other when we meet, but like two old gentlemen, in whom an innate politeness could not extinguish completely the memory of old grudges.] 19 See Critical Fictions, pp. 125-28. The Sartrian system cannot be totally self- enclosed, of course: the concept of upright posture, for example, is an integral part of our culture toward which the system must open. (See Erwin Strauss, "The Upright Posture," in Phenomenological Psychology [New York: Basic Books, 1966,] pp. 137-165. ) But to the degree that Sartre can make his philosophy self-sustaining, he does so. 69</page><page sequence="13">Yale French Studies of the characters and purity to another, is governed in this one expression by a different set of expectations, by axes of opposition that are drawn outside the text. Transposition and repetition breach the self-containment and the linearity of the text. A work that turns back on itself, that reaches forward to other texts, does not produce meaning solely by the addition of enclosed blocks of discourse. What Sartre objected to as poetic prose early in his career, we might now more neutrally associate with Jakobson's projection of the axis of similarity onto the axis of sequentiality or, alternatively, following Lotman, the "invasion of the iconic principle into the verbal arts." 20 According to Lotman, the iconic text, which cannot be broken down into discrete units of meaning, transmits as a whole a message grasped by a process of synthesis, while verbal description, made up of separable signs, is constructed as a narrative to which meaningful pieces of text are added. The verbal arts resist this principle. Poetry, for instance, tends to conceal the individual word as a unit of meaning within itself, and the entire poem presents itself as a unit. It is this tendency toward synchrony that Sartre attempts to restrain in his novels. In the theories he put forward at the time of the composition of The Age of Reason it is in part the concept of sequential and incremental elaboration that distinguishes prose communication from the poeme-objet, that ensures accessible and finite meaning. For the writer of prose to use language effectively, the theory seems to suggest that the potential autonomy of each distinct series of compositional elements ought to be held in check, yoked to time and narrative movement. But even if each series contains in germ, and reflects, all the others, still each series, in trans- mitting its message, produces meaning partially independent of narrative sequence. Redundancy implies an increase in informational possibilities. Sartrian space, Mathieu's space, which is also Roquen- tin's space, generates a decipherable message parallel perhaps but not necessarily subordinated to sequence of action. The sense of his own contingency revealed to Roquentin by developments in his experience 20 J. M. Lotman, "The Discrete Text and the Iconic Text," New Literary History, 6, no. 2 (Winter 1975), 333-338. 70</page><page sequence="14">Joseph Halpern of the world accords with the sequence of actions that brings him to total isolation, but the first series is by no means a vehicle for the second, nor are they tautologies. Both series contain choice and alternatives, and although the conclusions of both series coincide, space in Nausea is not manipulated in conformity with the conventions of narrative but unfolds according to its own rules of internal transformation. Total transparency is in any event an unlikely goal for a contemporary literary text, as Sartre has more recently conceded. Ambiguity, he has affirmed, is the very stuff of modern "literary prose." Even with directional centers and teleologies firmly estab- lished, even within a coded universe, ambiguity, both moral and semantic, exists within the space of Sartre's novels as a possibility of openness. Concise and economical, emphatic redundancy may be laudable virtues in committed literature, but sense is not so simply controlled, intuition and resonance not so easily muted, space not so easily tamed, and rhetorical distortion and the promiscuity of metaphor cannot be eliminated. Sartre's novels-Nausea, in particu- lar-are more than illustrated syllogisms; their metonymic unity opens onto the realm of similarity and repetition, metaphor and synchrony. The strength of Sartre's novels lies in the way they convey lived experience, but lived experience resists intelligibility. 21 Sartrian literary space, which is intelligible, finds its strength in a resistance to domination and a violation of convention, and in the imposition of Otherness on a domesticated world. It becomes interesting to the degree that it breaks free of textual enclosure and imposed system. Like the objects of Roquentin's world, which (anthropomorphically) rid themselves of their names and anthropocentric functions, one suspects in Sartre's literary space the capacity to slip from its conventional niche, to seek its freedom in parataxis and discontinuity, in the poetic, multiply determined interplay of codes, and create a self- reflexive textual space not minutely inscribed with Sartrian literary theory. 21 Roland Barthes, "L'Effet du reel," Communications 11 (1968), p. 89. 71</page></plain_text>
