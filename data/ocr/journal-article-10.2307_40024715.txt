<plain_text><page sequence="1">Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho, Nepeiia Valley, Peru David Chicoine University of East Anglia Norwich, United Kingdom Investigations in 2003 and 2004 at Huambacho (PV3 1-103), lower Nepena Valley, yielded significant data to assess the nature of Early Horizon (900-200 B.C.) architecture on the north-central coast of Peru. In Nepena, the Initial Period (1800-900 B.C.) mounds, such as Cerro Blanco and Punkuri, are superseded by several enclosure complexes, and new concepts of architecture appear in the archaeological record. This paper highlights the new architectural forms and presents evidence regarding building technology, func- tion, and spatial organization. The research indicates the existence, by 800 cal B.C., of a new architectural canon inspired by the local Initial Period tradition, and significantly different from that which is known at coeval sites associated with the so-called "Chavin Cult." Data from Huambacho contribute to our understanding of the changes that occurred in the region after the demise of Initial Period centers and our understanding of the social complexity and ceremonial variability that characterized the Early Horizon. Introduction In recent years, archaeologists and anthropologists have become increasingly aware of the dynamic and heteroge- neous aspect of early complex societies. Research outside large centers and core areas reveals insights into the vari- ability that characterizes more peripheral sociocultural for- mations and underscores the importance of their study for understanding broader, supra-regional developmental tra- jectories (Schortman and Urban 1994; Schwartz and Fal- coner 1994). In the Central Andes, scholars have applied different models to explore inter-regional interactions and cultural variability (Burger and Matos Mendieta 2002; Lau 2005; Stanish 2003). Most attention has been given to polities and the social and economic asymmetries between centers and client communities. Archaeologists have emphasized the role of political subjugation in the development of so- cial complexity, exploring many aspects of core initiatives and inter-regional interactions, such as territorial conquest (Moseley et al. 1991), imperial expansion (Goldstein 2005), and religious proselytism (Patterson 1968). Mean- while, case studies of groups outside or bordering core ar- eas, critical in shedding light on the unity and heterogene- ity of prehistoric Andean societies, have remained a low re- search priority. In Peru, issues of sociocultural unity and heterogeneity are particularly important to the study of the Early Hori- zon and the so-called Chavin phenomenon (Burger 1988). The Early Horizon (ca. 900-200 B.C.) was a period of pro- found sociocultural reorganization and innovations in ma- terial culture. Various peoples in distant regions of Peru co- alesced into a widespread religious and exchange network tied to Chavin de Huantar, a ceremonial center in the north-central highlands (Burger 1992: 192-202). While our knowledge about developments at Chavin de Huantar itself has improved (Burger 1984; Lumbreras 1977; Rick 2005), the role and geographical extent of the Chavin Cult in other regions and Early Horizon cultural variability in general, remain obscure. New data and revised models of regional development are needed to account for the cul- tural variability that characterized the Early Horizon out- side the Chavin religious network. As argued here, it ap- pears that certain communities were resistant to Chavin re- ligious influence, as expressed in markedly different forms of architecture and public art. Public ceremonial buildings are critical as a focus of study for they often embody group affiliations and stage activities perceived as intimately re- lated to ideological concepts and religious practices (Rapoport 1982: 191-192). The resistance to Chavin influence was tested by an ex- amination of patterns of architecture at Huambacho, an</page><page sequence="2">2 Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho, Nepena Valley, Peru/Chicoine Figure 1. Map of Peru locating the principal coastal river valleys and the archaeological sites mentioned in the text. Early Horizon community established in the lower Nepena Valley of coastal Peru (fig. i). Earlier archaeolog- ical work in this drainage suggested strong ties with Chavin de Huantar (Tello 1933b, 1933c), but until re- cently excavations yielded few Early Horizon architectural contexts. Meanwhile, intensive research in neighboring coastal valleys produced important data for Initial Period (ca. 1800-900 B.C.) societies and, by the same token, pushed back the dating of many Nepena sites considered Chavin derivatives. In 2003 and 2004, excavations by the Proyecto Huam- bacho yielded significant data on poorly known types of Early Horizon architecture. Large-scale horizontal clearing brought to light material evidence on the building tech- nology, the function, and the overall spatial organization of the site.

The findings at Huambacho indicate the existence, by the beginning of the Early Horizon, of new architectural conventions inspired by the coastal Initial Period tradition. Strong differences with earlier religious buildings, howev- er, suggest important changes experienced by Early Hori- zon groups. I argue that Huambacho architectural canons developed as an alternative to and in relative isolation from the Chavin interaction sphere, thus forcing revaluation of cultural variability during the Early Horizon and the char- acter of religion, authority, and interaction in early Andean civilization. Previous Research on the Early Horizon In Peru, the term "Early Horizon'3 was introduced by John Rowe (1960), in order to reduce the terminological ambiguity that surrounded the so-called "Chavin Period" or "Chavin horizon" (Tello 1943; Willey 1945). By defin- ition, the Early Horizon covers an arbitrary chronological unit which began with the first intrusion of Chavin influ- ence in the lea Valley and ended with the replacement of resin painting by polychrome slip -painted pottery (Rowe 1962: 49). Notwithstanding a conspicuous lack of consis- tency in its use, the Early Horizon, unlike the term "Chavin horizon" (Burger 1993; Willey 1945), stands on- ly for a block of time and is free of any implication of cul- tural homogeneity (Burger 1988: 106). It is used here to steer clear of assumptions of widespread developmental stages implicit in the alternative "Formative" terminology (Lumbreras 1974: 49). The Early Horizon runs from approximately 900 to 200 B.C. (Lanning 1967: 25; Willey 1971: 84-85), and corre- sponds to a period when an amalgam of regional develop- ments became linked through intensified religious and trade networks. Many technological advances were made, either through innovation or improvement of Initial Peri- od traditions (Burger 1988: 129-131; Kembel and Rick 2004: 54). The Early Horizon coincides with the spread of the Chavin Cult, and it is generally agreed that communi- ties that participated in the Chavin network exchanged ob- jects, ideas, and possibly people. Ideological and religious ties were expressed through similar ritual paraphernalia, iconography, and public ceremonial architecture (Burger 1992: 191-203). Different regions participated in various ways, and to differing degrees, in the Chavin interaction sphere. Indeed, Chavin religion could co-exist with other coeval religious traditions (Burger 1988: 113-117). As asserted by Richard Burger (1988, 1992), the influ- ence of the Chavin Cult ranged, by the Janabarriu Phase (390-200 B.C.) at Chavin de Huantar (Burger 1981: 596), from Paracas on the south coast (Tello 1943) to Pacopam- pa in the north highlands (Rosas and Shady 1970) (fig. i). However, there are still many problems with the dating of the ceremonial core at Chavin de Huantar (Kembel and Rick 2004: 62) and, despite sustained efforts, the Chavin phenomenon remains poorly understood, especially from the standpoint of regional cultural variability. Discoveries at several coastal sites in the 1980s, as well as revised dating for Chavin de Huantar itself (Burger 1981), raised questions about the presence of Chavin in- fluence in certain regions and provoked debates on the val- ue of the concept of the Chavin horizon (Burger 1993; Po- zorski and Pozorski 1987a). The Nepena Valley was often at the core of the discussions, because of evidence of strong ties between the local populations and Chavin de Huantar. In the 1930s, Julio C. Tello excavated spectacular sculpted friezes at Cerro Blanco and Punkuri (fig. 2), two sites he considered Chavin temples on the basis of resemblances in architecture and public art (Antunez de Mayolo 1933; Tel- lo 1933a, 1933b, 1933c). For instance, at Cerro Blanco, a site composed of three platforms originally part of a single U-shaped architectural complex (Bischof 1997), Tello ex- cavated a series of superimposed structures (Tello 1933a), the earliest of which was decorated with painted clay sculp- tures in a style that he interpreted as Chavin. On top of that structure, he found a second one made of conical mud bricks or adobes which he associated with the decline of Chavin influence in the valley. At Punkuri, Tello uncovered a stepped mound composed of two platforms linked by a central stairway inside of which he discovered an oversized sculpted snarling feline head (Antunez de Mayolo 1933: 16). The walls were finely plastered and painted with low- relief friezes highly reminiscent, Tello argued, of Chavin de Huantar. Overall, Tello used the presence of incised, fire-reduced monochrome pottery sherds, in conjunction with the iconographic content of the sculpted friezes, to promote the idea of a pan-regional Chavin culture. In his view, the sites of Cerro Blanco and Punkuri were derivatives of high- land developments and coeval with a time when the Nepena Valley came under the influence of Chavin de Huantar (Tello 1943: 136-138). Even though most ar- chaeologists accepted Tello's ideas, which greatly con- tributed to the creation and acceptance of a Chavin hori- zon (Willey 1951: 11, 1971: 123), at least one archaeolo- gist saw the Nepena-Chavin connection differently. Rafael Larco (1941) opposed Tello's view and suggested that the sites in Nepena predated the foundation of Chavin de Huantar. Stylistically, Cerro Blanco and Punkuri were linked more closely, for Larco, to the north coast Cupis-</page><page sequence="4">4 Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho, Nepena Valley, Peru/Chicoine Figure 2.

The inset shows river valleys of the north-central coast of Peru. nique culture which first developed during the Initial Peri- od. While there is debate concerning the chronological po- sition and significance of the Nepena mural friezes, Cerro Blanco and Punkuri can be dated to the Initial Period on architectural and stylistic grounds (Daggett 1984: 85-102). This interpretation is supported by discoveries made at several Initial Period sites such as Limoncarro in the Jequetepeque Valley (Pozorski and Pozorski 1987b: 43), Caballo Muerto (at Huaca de los Reyes) in the Moche Valley (Pozorski 1976: 170-187, 305-324, 1980: 107), Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke (Pozorski and Pozorski 1986: 400) and Cerro Sechin in the Casma Valley (Bonavia 1974: 30-35; Samaniego 1973: 42-51), and Garagay in the Rimac Valley (Ravines 1975). Artwork at Huaca de los Reyes, for example, compares favorably with Cerro Blanco and, like the Nepena temples, it was first built of stone and mud and only later of conical adobes (Pozorski 1976: 239). Beyond stylistic evidence, recent ex- cavations at Cerro Blanco (Koichiro Shibata, personal communication 2005) and Punkuri (Samaniego 1992) have yielded stratigraphic, ceramic, and radiometric evi- dence which substantiates their dating to the Initial Period and their apparent temporal priority over the establish- ment and development of Chavin de Huantar. While the gap in our knowledge produced by this chronological clar- ification has attracted little scientific interest (Burger 1993: 55), in Nepena, it forces archaeologists to reevaluate pre- vious models of Early Horizon cultural developments (e.g., Daggett 1987). The Nepena Valley was visited by early explorers and ar- chaeologists (e.g., Horkheimer 1965; Kosok 1965; Mid- dendorf 1973 [1896]; Soriano 1941; Squier 1973 [1877]; Tello 1933b, 1933c), but the most extensive surveys of the valley were conducted by Donald Proulx (1968, 1973, 1985) and Richard Daggett (1984). They identified a to-</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field Archaeology [Vol. 31, 2006 5 tal of 363 sites in the valley, more than 100 dating to the Early Horizon. Based on surface evidence, their research mainly focused on early cultural developments in order to position sites chronologically and understand settlement patterns, ceramics, and architectural traits. They suggested the existence of at least two distinct phases of Early Hori- zon development in Nepena (Proulx 1985: 221-235). While the validity of their chronological framework awaits confirmation from excavated stratigraphic data, Proulx and Daggett's work allows the identification of dis- tinct types of architecture. A "megalithic" type of architec- ture (Daggett 1983), mainly distributed in the upper sec- tion of the Nepena Valley, is best exemplified at ridge-top sites, such as Kushipampa, Huancarpon, and Quisque (fig. 2). At Kushipampa, for example, large enclosure structures were made of finely cut stone blocks, larger- than-human lintels, and double-faced walls (Proulx 1968: 96-99, 1985: 231). Daggett attributed at least three com- plexes of stone-wall enclosures to the Early Horizon: Caylan in the middle valley, and Samanco and Huambacho in the lower valley (Daggett 1984; Richard Daggett, per- sonal communication 1999). Many features distinguish them from megalithic architecture, notably the extensive use of mud mortar, the smaller scale of the stonework, and their valley floor location (Daggett 1984: 213-218). Sur- face evidence collected by Daggett shows a strong connec- tion with similar complexes surveyed by Donald Collier (1960), Donald Thompson (1961), and Shelia and Thomas Pozorski (1987a) in the neighboring Casma Val- ley. For example, the sites of San Diego and Pampa Rosario appear to share the same architectural layout. Indeed, test pit excavations have dated the sites to the Early Horizon (Pozorski and Pozorski 1987a: 51-70). Apparent differ- ences from Initial Period mounds like Las Haldas, Sechin Alto, and Pampa de las Llamas Moxeke, led the Pozorskis to suggest that the Early Horizon in Casma was marked by a major cultural disruption. They go further and argue that Casma was conquered by highland invaders (Pozorski 1987: 25-28; Pozorski and Pozorski 1987a: 118-119; Po- zorski and Pozorski 1987b: 45). This interpretation is also used by Daggett to conclude that "Nepena was essentially unoccupied at the start of the Early Horizon and... subse- quently settled by highlanders" (Daggett 1987: 78). While the decline of Initial Period coastal centers and the origins of subsequent changes have provoked many discussions (Burger 1992: 184-190), most archaeologists agree that coastal societies experienced a deep social, and possibly environmental, crisis (Elera 1998; Onuki 2001; Pozorski and Pozorski 1987a). Burger (1992) and Wilson (1988), for instance, see the extensive use of ridges and the presence of several defensive fortifications as an index of the instability triggered by the collapse of Initial Period so- cieties centered in the Casma Valley. Defensive structures, they argue, represent the most important focus of public building efforts during the Early Horizon (Burger 1992: 188; Wilson 1988: 104). Field Research The Proyecto Huambacho (2003-2004) was undertak- en to better understand Early Horizon societies in the low- er Nepena, especially their architecture and sociocultural correlates. Many sites of that time period have been iden- tified on the north-central coast, but very little evidence comes from excavations such as those at Huambacho. Large-scale surveys (e.g., Wilson 1988), test pits, and lim- ited excavations (e.g., Pozorski and Pozorski 1987a) were preferred over extensive horizontal clearings and detailed architectural plans, making it difficult for archaeologists to interpret the architecture, internal spatial organization, function, and dates of these sites (Moore 1996: 227). The Site ofHuambaeho Huambacho, also known as Huambacho Viejo, occu- pies a flat sandy plain (Pampa el Cementerio or Pampa del Inca) on the southern margin of the lower Nepena. Bor- dered to the south by hills, it is located 8 km from the Pa- cific shoreline and at approximately 65 masl. The site lies strategically at the limit of the cultivated valley floor and consists of two distinct architectural compounds (the Main Compound and the North Compound) connected by a wall 75 m long. The two compounds originally covered an area of more than 12 ha, but the recent encroachment of cultivated fields has totally destroyed the North Com- pound. A modern irrigation canal runs on the nw edge of the site and has unfortunately destroyed part of the architec- ture. Some 80 m west of the canal runs an acequia (Rio Viejo), a seasonal water source which probably represent- ed the nw limit of the Early Horizon settlement. To the sw, the site is delimited by a modern cemetery adjacent to the Panamerican highway, located some 200 m from the Main Compound. Across the Panamerican highway is Cerro Popo, a granite hill of conical shape which stands almost 200 masl. Structures are present on top of the hill, but their relation to the Huambacho site is unknown. The Main Compound, which was the focus of the Proyecto Huambacho, covers an area of 8.4 ha (400 x 210 m) and is composed of a complex arrangement of court- yards, corridors, and raised mounds (fig. 3). These struc- tures are remarkable for their diversity in size, quality of construction and finish, and internal design and complexi- ty. Huambacho is dominated by two large sunken plazas</page><page sequence="6">6 Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho, Nepena Valley, Peru/Chicoine Figure 3. Map of the Main Compound at Huambacho showing architecture and excavation units. and two complexes of raised platforms. The site contrasts with Initial Period and Chavin-related ceremonial centers by its lack of overall symmetry and absence of a central axis. The archaeological site of Huambacho was first report- ed by Augusto Soriano (1941: 267), who identified it as a Chimu provincial center. The first plan of Huambacho was drawn by Proulx in 1967 (Proulx 1968: 136, plan 20), who sampled surface ceramics and identified Moche, Cas- ma, and Chimu components. The abundance of Casma In- cised and Red- White-Black pottery sherds, combined with the style of the architecture, led him to suggest that the main occupation was during the Middle Horizon (ca. a.d. 600-1000; Proulx 1968: 137). This interpretation was reused by Wilson in his discussion of the so-called "Red- White-Black" Middle Horizon state (Wilson 1988: 334), and amended in 1995 by Daggett who recovered Early Horizon ceramics (Richard Daggett, personal communica- tion 1999). Excavation results at Huambacho substantiate the mul- ti-component nature of the site. Most architectural struc- tures were built as part of a single initial occupation repre- sented by 10 carbon samples (table i) dated to between 2490 ± 70 b.p. and 2250 ± 40 b.p. (all dates reported as "b.p." are conventional uncalibrated radiocarbon years). Thcprimary construction and occupation of Huambacho can be placed in the Early Horizon, between 800 and 200 cal B.C., calibrated with a two-sigma range (Bronk Ram- sey 2001, 2003). The primary Early Horizon occupation was followed by several subsequent reoccupations repre- sented by intrusive burials (our excavations documented 20) and occasional squatter-like dwellings. Methods Most structures at Huambacho are still visible on the surface. They are partially buried under a layer of wind- blown sand, but it was possible to make a plan of them. Ar- chitectural details such as entryways and pillars were sub- sequently added to the plan after excavation. Based on sur- face information, the Main Compound was divided into five operative sectors: South (SS), Central (CS), North (NS), North Extension (NE), and Huaca-A (HA) (fig. 3). Distinct rooms were identified and given an area number followed by the sector's abbreviation (e.g., A-l/CS for area one of the Central Sector). For each sector, a distinct num- bering sequence was used (e.g., A-2/SS and A-2/NE). Ex- cavation units, delimited in order to investigate specific ar- chitectural features, were oriented after the site layout (N41°E). A total of 29 units were excavated at Huambacho dur- ing 23 weeks of fieldwork over two seasons.

This repre- sents more than 60% of the total number of rooms esti- mated for the Main Compound (ca. 80). Excavations fo- cused on the horizontal clearing of specific architectural structures in order to understand their organization and layout. Layers of sand and debris were removed with the objective of clearing occupation floors to allow the record- ing of architecture and associated artifacts. At Huambacho, the bulk of the Early Horizon occupa- tion floors were found less than a meter below the surface. In most areas, they were set up directly on the sandy pam- pa (plain) and were partially destroyed, especially around the pillars and the walls. The general stratigraphic sequence from the top was windblown sand (ca. 15-20 cm), debris of collapsed Early Horizon structures (a layer of stone, mud mortar, and sand; ca. 50-100 cm), sand, dirt, and re- mains associated with occupational floors (ca. 10-15 cm), and clay floors (ca. 5 cm). Contexts were carefully excavat- ed and sifted using i/8-inch screen (ca. 3 mm). Test pits be- low the floor level were made to investigate the building techniques. In the case of raised structures, excavations were continued beneath the floor level in order to sample construction fill materials and techniques, as well as to doc- ument possible superimposed structures. On one occasion, a superposition of three occupational floors was discov- ered. When natural or cultural layers could be delineated within the architectural fill stratum, their division was fol- lowed. Otherwise, or if greater accuracy was needed, the fill was divided into arbitrary layers of 10 cm. Excavation Results Excavations at Huambacho yielded representative sam- ples of Early Horizon architecture and cultural materials. The latter mainly came from refuse deposits associated with construction fill, but also from occupation floors. They include broken ceramics (ca. 4000 diagnostic sherds), mainly cooking and serving vessels (neckless jars or ollas and open shallow bowls, respectively), grater bowls, pan- pipes, spindle whorls, and discs. Stone bowls, mortars and pestles, war club heads, and jet mirrors were also recov- ered. Further, several blue and white woven textiles were preserved along with Spondylus shell beads, bone imple- ments, gourd containers (Lagenaria siceraria), and culinary remains. Overall, preliminary analyses of the artifact as- semblages are consistent with the architectural evidence and suggest that public ceremonial activities were carried out at Huambacho. Architecture at Huambacho The architecture demonstrates the existence of well-de- fined building conventions. The majority of wall structures were constructed of granitic stone laid in silt-clay mortar. The stones were likely quarried from outcrops of the near- by Cerro Popo hill located some 350 m sw of the site. Many stones feature a rectangular notch removed from one of the corners. In situ examples show that these notched stones were laid in the corners of walls and pillars. The foundations of the walls were set directly in the sand and gravel of the valley plain. Walls themselves were consis- tently erected following the so-called "orthostatic tech- nique" using stone slabs, or orthostats, set upright at the base of a structure to form the lower section (Fleming, Ho- nour, and Pevsner 1999: 416). The technique has been re- ported in coastal Peru in pre- and post-Early Horizon con-</page><page sequence="8">8 Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho, Nepena Valley, Peru/Chicoine Figure 4.

At Huambacho, stone slabs (up to ca. 80 cm long) were set vertically in the ground, with their lower sections buried, in order to create a chamber. Slabs were held together by mud mortar and the chamber was filled with smaller stones and rubble. Subsequent layers of flat, quarried stone and mud mortar were then placed horizon- tally on top of the orthostats. The exterior facades of most walls were smoothed and covered with white plaster, some still bearing fingerprints. Specific areas were richly deco- rated with painted murals and sculpted clay friezes. Four examples of adobe walls were documented during the excavations. The adobe walls are uneven, unplastered, and represent additions to, and modifications of, earlier spaces. The adobe bricks are of rectangular shape, but most specimens were cut and reduced to make them fit into the wall matrix. No conical adobes, common at Initial Period monumental sites, were discovered at Huambacho. Small- er unfired conical clay objects were used, however, to or- nament some public spaces, notably the sunken plazas. Though morphologically akin to conical adobes (see Shi- mada 1981: 417, fig. 15), the "decorative cones" discov- ered at Huambacho are unique in terms of their size and function. They average 16 cm long and 13 cm in diameter and have flat, smooth bases decorated with incised geo- metric designs. The conical parts are poorly finished; im- prints of canes and stone can often be identified on them. Excavation results indicate that decorative cones were in- serted in specific sections of wall and roof structures in such a way as to allow their motifs to be seen. More than 200 specimens of these decorative clay cones were recovered during the excavation of collapsed structures (fig. 4). The stonework at Huambacho shows a high degree of formal continuity and, even though isolated examples of roughly made walls were identified, good workmanship is a characteristic of the architecture. Little variation was not- ed in the dimensions, the orientation, or the organization of structures. The use of a measurement system was con- firmed by the discovery, in A-3/HA, of wooden stakes still in place at the base of certain walls and pillars. Similar sur- vey devices have been reported from other early coastal sites, where they were apparently used to align structures and guide masons in their work (Grieder 1975: 102-103). The high quality of the stonework at Huambacho contrasts sharply with the domestic structures and habitation dwellings documented at other Early Horizon sites such as Las Haldas (Grieder 1975: 103; Matsuzawa 1978) and San Diego (Pozorski and Pozorski 1987b: 54), suggesting that the Main Compound at Huambacho represented an architectural complex of special significance for the local population.</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 9 Figure 5.

Architectural Units In terms of its internal spatial organization, Huamba- cho was organized as a complex of repeating, standardized rectangular architectural units. In particular, it appears that the builders had a strong understanding of architectural conventions which they expressed in distinct and highly recognizable room types with rigid internal spatial organi- zation. The access system is one of the most striking exam- ples of rigid planning; all excavated examples of entrances were located in the corners of rooms. Moreover, entryways were frequently baffled and/or complemented by a narrow passageway. When necessary, wooden posts and/or stone walls were built to prohibit visual access to certain areas and to make the interior activities invisible to outsiders. This helped to insulate the spaces from wind, sand, and sound. It also illustrates an intention to control the move- ments and the flow of people within the Main Compound. Architectural units at Huambacho are rectangular. Most units are contiguous and typically organized as patio groups with interior colonnades. The apparent absence of typical, independent dwelling units with benches, sleeping areas, or food processing facilities argues for the non-resi- dential nature of most buildings. The Huambacho com- munity could have extended outside the immediate vicini- ty of the Main Compound public ceremonial core, howev- er. Unfortunately, Huambacho has suffered from modern human activities and most of the surroundings are under cultivation. Parallels can nevertheless be drawn with other early coastal centers. For instance, at Montegrande, a Cu- pisnique site in the upper Jequetepeque Valley, excavations led by Michael Tellenbach (1986) have shown that the cer- emonial core of the site was surrounded by fine elite resi- dential architecture while commoner habitations, made of perishable materials, were established on the periphery of the site. At Huambacho, four room types could be recognized: colonnaded patio rooms, restricted storage facilities, "backrooms," and sunken plazas. A total of 18 colonnaded patio rooms were excavated. The data indicate very rigid spacing with colonnades of rectangular pillars averaging 60 x 50 cm set at a distance of approximately 2 m from the in- terior faces of the walls (fig. 5). These pillars supported a roof structure made of perishable materials as evidenced by the numerous cane imprints found in the debris of col- lapsed roofs. Patio rooms were unroofed in the center and one to four sides were roofed. The size of the patios varies</page><page sequence="10">1 0 Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho, Nepena Valley, Peru/Chicoine Figure 6. Plan reconstruction of the Central Sector showing the architectural organization of Plaza-A and the Main Platform Complex. Line thicknesses are indicative of wall thicknesses. substantially. Some are small and made for only a few peo- ple at most (e.g., A-12/CS, 36 sq m), while larger ones could have accommodated large numbers of people (e.g., A-2/NE, 1178 sq m). Finally, some of the patio rooms were raised, creating different patio levels. This particular building technique was widespread in ancient coastal Peru and consists of filling retaining chambers with various types of materials in order to elevate buildings. Storage facilities are represented by small rooms located next to or directly within a patio room. These restricted spaces were probably accessed from above as no entrances could be identified. In one of these storage rooms (A- 2A/SS), eight gourd containers were found; they were like- ly used to store, carry, and serve food and drink. Also, smaller rectangular chambers, termed "backrooms," are lo- cated at the back of patio rooms. The backrooms sampled (e.g., A-4A/CS, A-6/HA) are each rectangular with a single access; the absence of pillars and restricted size suggest a roof. The relative location of backrooms argues for a func- tion complementary to the activities conducted in patio rooms. Finally, two sunken plazas, organized with "outer wall-platforms" (see below) surrounding a sunken area, were the focus of public ceremonial gatherings within the Main Compound. The monumental outer wall-platforms were floored, roofed, and colonnaded with rectangular pil- lars. These spaces were decorated with sculpted clay friezes in a unique fashion; they are rather different in form and content than Chavin-related ceremonial architecture. The Main Compound at Huambacho The Main Compound represented the ceremonial core at Huambacho. It is dominated by two sets of raised plat- forms (the Main Platform Complex and the Huaca-A Complex) as well as two sunken plazas (Plaza-A and Plaza- B). Because of their location, the Main Platform Complex and Plaza-A appear to have constituted the core of the Main Compound (fig. 6). Excavation results indicate these features were utilized in different ways, as settings for public and private gatherings. plaza-a Plaza-A (A-l/CS) is a square sunken court, measuring 78 x 78 m which is the largest enclosed space at Huamba- cho. The bulk of the public gatherings at the site would have taken place in this sunken area. Plaza-As monumental walls can be referred to as "outer wall-platforms." They measure approximately 8 m wide and surround a sunken area of 3969 sq m (63 x 63 m). The outer wall-platforms rise 2 m above the floor of the sunken area and they were built using the filled-chamber technique. No artifacts were</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 1 1 Figure 7. View from the west of the ne corner of the sunken area of Plaza-A showing the outer wall- platforms, inset staircase, and low-relief clay friezes. Note the pairs of niches at the base of the pillars. recovered from the sand fill; since later architectural addi- tions at Huambacho contained large amounts of refuse, this suggests Plaza-A was built prior to the occupation of the site. Plaza- As wall-platforms were topped with a floor, and covered with a roof structure. The roof was made of perishable material, as evidenced by the remains of wood- en beams, fragments of canes, cane imprints, and a row of supporting rectangular pillars averaging 70 x 60 cm. Sur- face survey revealed two pairs of inset stairways on the east and west walls connecting the top of the walls with the sunken area. One staircase was excavated in the ne corner (fig. 7); it is 1.3 m wide and composed of seven steps, each step averaging 55 cm in depth. The staircase was erected with finely cut stone slabs laid horizontally in the mortar and covered with white plaster. It is well-preserved, even though the edges of the steps show traces of use. A pair of graffiti depicting linear hatched designs face each other inside the staircase (fig. 8: k-l). Other exam- ples of graffiti were collected from fragments of plaster from the collapsed areas of Plaza-A (fig. 8: a-g). Among these, various anthropomorphic and zoomorphic repre- sentations were noted, such as male anthropomorphs and bird figures. Graffiti have been reported from other early coastal sites in Peru such as Huaca Lucia and Huaca Soledad in the La Leche Valley (Shimada 1981: 420-421, 1986: 177-179) and Cardal in the Lurin Valley (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1991: 281, fig. 4) where they were in- terpreted as evidence for ceremonial activities. A series of rectangular pillars embedded some 50 cm in the sand substrate were set into the floor. Pairs of rectan- gular niches were found near the base of each of the pillars (fig. 7). The niches transect the width of each pillar, creat- ing "holes" through the supporting structures. Their exact function and significance are unknown, but they could have been decorative. The excavation of the east and north walls yielded evi- dence of clay relief friezes. On the upper section of the in- terior wall, directly facing the sunken area, a series of step- and-rectangle motifs were sculpted in low-relief. Study of the west and south walls indicates that this decorative frieze ran around the entire sunken area. The destruction of most of the upper section of the wall makes it impossible to know if the designs were repeated or were part of a more complex pattern. The iconographic content of the frieze matches the designs from decorative clay cones found dur- ing the excavation of the debris of the collapsed walls, pil- lars, and roof structure of Plaza-A (fig. 4). Most of these cones were found between the colonnades and the exterior wall, suggesting they adorned either the exterior wall, the roof structure, or both. Additionally, we discovered sec- tions of collapsed walls with in situ specimens. Thus, the motifs depicted on the cones were probably organized as a</page><page sequence="12">12 Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho, Nepena Valley, Peru/Chicoine Figure 8. Graffiti discovered in the debris of the collapsed walls of Plaza- A (A-G) and Huaca-A (H, I), and in situ on a Plaza-B pillar (J), and inside the ne staircase of Plaza-A (K-L). decorative register complementary to the clay friezes of the sunken area and, possibly, the niches at the base of the pil- lars. Some variation was noted in the geometric designs of the clay cones, but most specimens depicted variants of simple or double step motifs and zigzag motifs. More mural decoration was noted on the south wall of the corridor connecting Plaza-A with A-5/NS to the north. We identified a poorly preserved wall mural, sculpted in the wet clay, depicting a marine animal or a serpent com- plemented by several angular geometric forms. It is possi- ble that the depiction was part of a larger and more com- plex mural scene. Plaza-A appears to have been engineered to host a large number of people involved in public activities. It stands out as the largest enclosed space at the site and, according- ly, the elaborate finish and decoration given by the builders clearly suggests that Plaza-A was meant to be seen by visi- tors and to impress them, as has been reported from other sites in coastal Peru (Pillsbury 1996; Quilter 2001). An iso- metric reconstruction of Plaza-A shows how the sunken area was enclosed within the outer wall-platforms and how the clay friezes, niched pillars, and decorative cones would have been organized (fig. 9). The floors of Plaza-A, as throughout the complex, were relatively bare but some ar- tifacts were recovered. For example, directly on the floor of the north wall-platform, a broken black monochrome stir- rup-spout bottle was collected (fig. 10). The lip of the bot- tle was thickened, and exhibited highly polished areas al- ternating with zones of punctation. This zone punctate type of decoration has also been reported at other Early Horizon sites on the north-central coast (Proulx 1985: 191-192, 194-196), as well as from Cupisnique Phase sites on the north coast (Larco 1941; Pozorski 1983). Complete specimens of this type of vessel are generally en- countered in funerary contexts. Inside the sunken area, evidence for the consumption of food and drink came from the discovery of a broken neck- less jar or olla with a lateral pouring spout. This rare vessel type was also documented at San Diego in the Casma Val- ley (Pozorski and Pozorski 1987a: 57, fig. 33). In addition, directly at the base of the ne staircase, two gourd recepta- cles were found on the floor of the sunken area. MAIN PLATFORM COMPLEX Excavations east of Plaza-A revealed that Huambacho also had areas for more restricted, private gatherings. The</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Held Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 13 Figure 9. Isometric reconstruction of Plaza-A. The inset shows the organization of clay friezes, niched pillars, and decorative cones. Entrances and roof structures are not shown. Main Platform Complex contrasts with Plaza-A in terms of its higher degree of internal complexity, reflected in both the number and smaller size of the rooms, and their tight- ly graded access. It consists of a series of contiguous colon- naded patios connected by corridors and dominated by room A-3/CS, the least accessible patio and most elevated structure at the site (figs. 6, n). A-3/CS measures 30 x 26 m and is organized as a patio with four colonnaded sides. Study of collapsed structures from the north section of A- 3/CS showed that the walls and pillars originally stood at least 3 m high. The platform was built using the filled- chamber technique and originally stood more than 5 m above the base of the site. Just as for Plaza-A, the Main Platform Complex was built directly on the sandy pampa and no occupation floor was observed underneath the con- struction fill. The composition of the fill varied. Layers of vegetal materials, mainly maize, alternated with layers of sand mixed with gravel in order to reinforce the stability of unconsolidated components. No artifacts were recovered from the construction fill of the raised areas, which sug- gests that, like Plaza-A, the Main Platform Complex was built prior to the occupation of the site. Three carbon sam- ples were collected from layers of vegetal remains con- tained in the architectural fill and dated to 2480 ± 60 b.p. (Beta-185373), 2410 ± 50 b.p. (Beta-185375), and 2350 ± 70 b.p. (Beta-185372). The Main Platform Complex provides important data on the complexity of access patterns and spatial subdivi- sions at Huambacho. Accessed through A-10/CS, the Main Platform Complex was subdivided into at least two sub-compounds (fig. ii). One of these, Sub-Compound- A, located to the east of A-10/CS, is composed of at least seven contiguous colonnaded patio rooms, while Sub- Compound-B is a series of agglutinated rooms which ulti- mately lead to A-3/CS, the most visible raised feature. This room could hold few individuals and it is likely that the Main Platform Complex represented a more private area than the large Plaza-A. In contrast to Plaza-A, the colon-</page><page sequence="14">14 Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho, Nepena Valley, Peru/Chicoine Figure 10. Broken reduced-fired stirrup-spout bottle found on the floor of the north outer wall-platform of Plaza-A. naded patios here lack interior architectural ornamenta- tion, such as low-relief friezes, decorative clay cones, or niches. In fact, the only evidence of wall decoration comes from the excavation of A-13/NS where fragments of low- relief clay modeling depicting zigzag designs were discov- ered in the debris of the collapsed north facade of A-3/CS. This location suggests, in contrast to Plaza-A, that the dec- orative features of the Main Platform Complex were de- signed to be seen from outside, rather than from inside. plaza-b Plaza-B (A-l/NE) is a rectangular sunken court located in the North Extension Sector (fig. 3) that provides im- portant data on Huambacho's architectural dynamics. Sec- tions of its walls have been partly destroyed and it present- ly measures 56 x 59 m. Plaza-B is adjacent to a complex of courtyards to the east and appears to have constituted a dis- crete sub-compound, distinct from Plaza-A and the Main Platform Complex. Excavation results demonstrate an ini- tial occupation of the North Extension Sector coeval with the construction of the Central Sector, while Plaza-B rep- resents a later addition. Radiometric evidence dated the oc- cupation of A-2A/NE, a patio room east of Plaza-B, at 2420 ± 60 b.p. (Beta-185374). The sample came from a pit filled with maize cobs. Carbon samples of manioc (Manihot esculenta) and maize coeval with the construction of the outer wall-platforms of Plaza-B dated to 2370 ± 70 b.p. (Beta-197090) and 2360 ± 60 b.p. (Beta- 197089), re- spectively. The layout of Plaza-B parallels that of Plaza-A. The out- er wall-platforms are roughly the same width as those of Plaza-A and the sunken area was accessed through two pairs of aligned inset staircases. Our excavations at Plaza-B documented two superimposed phases of construction and also recovered Early Horizon refuse materials used as fill. Colonnades of rectangular pillars were excavated on the south and east walls (fig. 5). The south pillars each had a single niche near their base reminiscent of those found in Plaza-A. A graffito depicting a sub-circular shape with cross-hatched lines (fig. 8: j) was also noted on one of the south pillars. Overall, the material evidence recovered from Plaza-B suggests another large enclosed public space, albeit smaller and slightly later than Plaza-A. This architectural pattern of adding and shifting public ceremonial spaces contrasts with earlier ceremonial centers, where renovation programs often focused on "mounding" a single monu- ment over a long period of time or, in other words, by erecting larger buildings on top of previous ones. HUACA-A COMPLEX Investigations to the north of the Main Compound re- vealed another complex of raised patio rooms and corri- dors, called Huaca-A (fig. 3); it is similar to the Main Plat- form Complex. Fieldwork at Huaca-A highlighted Huam- bacho's distinctive renovation programs and provided im- portant data on site chronology. Ancient burial practices, recent looting, and agricultural activities have damaged the architectural remains. As a result, large amounts of shell refuse and broken ceramics were found on the surface in this area (see also Proulx 1968: 137). Also, a concentration of large broken domestic jars some 90 m nw of Huaca-A was observed. Excavations at Huaca-A cleared more than 400 sq m and revealed a complex building sequence char- acterized by a series of rebuilding and reuse episodes (fig. 12). Three superimposed construction episodes, which we have provisionally divided into Early, Middle, and Late Phases, were identified. During the Early Phase, Huaca-A was dominated by a central room, A-l/HA. Early Phase occupation floors were usually very well preserved and buried under large amounts of refuse material, in some places more than 2 m thick. Sev- eral test pits excavated below Early Phase floors indicate</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 1 5 Figure 11. Isometric reconstruction of the Main Platform Complex. The inset shows the access sequence for Sub-Compounds A and B. that structures were built directly on the sterile sand stra- tum. With the exception of A-3/HA no examples of colon- naded architecture were documented from Early Phase contexts. In the sw section, adjacent to patio room A- 3/HA, a restricted rectangular room (A-8/HA) measuring approximately 2.50 x 1.50m is interpreted as a storage fa- cility. Most Early Phase occupation floors were found without significant traces of activity. One exception was a concen- tration of ash on the floor of the central room. The ash de- posit, which provided a charcoal sample, belonged to a lay- er of refuse and corresponds to the abandonment of the Early Phase floor and the first burying episode or Middle Phase modifications of the Huaca-A Complex. The char- coal sample yielded an age of 2370 ± 70 b.p. (Beta- 197091). The result is largely consistent with an age of 2360 ± 60 b.p. (Beta- 197088) obtained from charcoal found beneath an access ramp that was built as part of the Middle Phase remodeling of A-5/HA (fig. 13). Middle Phase constructions at the Huaca-A Complex began with raising the height of A-l/HA, and the building of an access ramp on its east flank. Floors of the structures were raised some 2.5 m and walls and rectangular pillars were erected on top of the architectural fill, superseding the Early Phase structures. The raised platform area was divid- ed into distinct spaces. A-l/HA became a colonnaded pa- tio with a backroom, A-6/HA, directly to its south. Dur- ing the Middle Phase, A- 1/HA, A-6/HA, and A-4/HA rep- resented the highest structures of the Huaca-A Complex. Excavation of A-3/HA, located directly south of A-6/HA and A-4/HA, provided evidence that the south facade of the raised complex was decorated with painted murals. In the debris of the collapsed walls, red and yellow pigments were observed on fragments of wall plaster. Evidence of painting was also found on sections of collapsed walls. In- cisions in association with the paintings were noted and a step-and-fret motif was identified. In addition, graffiti were depicted on wall plaster fragments from A-3/HA (fig. 8: h-i), a large colonnaded patio linking the area with the rest of the Main Compound. At the Huaca-A Complex, the Late Phase architecture was badly preserved. Surviving architectural remains sug- gest that Late Phase remodeling principally involved rais- ing the height of rooms A-5/HA and A-7/HA to enlarge A- 1/HA. The elevated structures of the Huaca-A Complex, by the Last Phase, came to cover more than 800 sq m. For the most part, radiocarbon evidence corroborates the building sequence inferred from the architectural evi-</page><page sequence="16">16 Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho, Nepena Valley, Peru/Chicoine Figure 12. Map of Huaca-A Complex showing the three construction phases and the carbon sample findspots. dence. Excavation of the corridor north of A-l/HA yield- ed a sample of maize cobs dated to 2250 ± 40 b.p. (Beta- 197087). The cobs were secured from a layer of sand trapped between the Middle Phase floor and the Late Phase construction fill. The date is consistent with two dates obtained from Middle Phase construction fill and in- dicates that the corridor was still in use when Middle Phase modifications took place. Further, a maize sample from a more superficial section of the fill in A-7/HA yielded an ad- ditional date of 2490 ± 70 b.p. (Beta- 197086). Concluding Remarks: Perspectives on Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho An evaluation of the Early Horizon architectural vari- ability at Huambacho leads to a number of conclusions. The site was built on a previously unoccupied fringe of the lower Nepena plain. The Main Compound at Huambacho represents a planned, coherent building project. No exper- imentation or significant changes in the technological as- pect of the architecture were observed. Consistency was noted in the dimensions and alignment of a rather complex layout of rooms, pillars, and baffled entryways, and the same organizational features were repeated over both space and time. Radiocarbon assays suggest a period of no more than 250 radiocarbon years for the entire Early Horizon construction of the Main Compound. A two-sigma range calibration of the radiocarbon evidence allows us to infer that the Early Horizon construction of Huambacho is un- likely to have begun before 800 cal B.C., nor continued af- ter 200 cal B.C. This interpretation was substantiated by the discovery of intrusive Salinar period burials at Huaca- A dated 50 cal b.c.-cal a.d. 130 and cal a.d 20-340 (table i). A time gap of almost 200 years thus appears be- tween the last Early Horizon occupation and the first re- occupations of the site. At Huambacho, some small storage facilities and back- rooms were documented, but the bulk of the architecture consists of colonnaded patios. The excavation of several of these patios produced little evidence of domestic activities, and occupation floors were for the most part bare of arti- facts. In contrast, refuse deposits at Plaza-B and Huaca-A yielded large amounts of serving vessels, ceramic panpipes, and culinary remains that point to the consumption of food, mainly maize and shellfish, and drink, possibly maize beer or chicha, as well as to musical performances as part of activities conducted at Huambacho. Although the analysis of refuse materials is preliminary, it suggests that the en- closed spaces were designed to accommodate public gath- erings of different sizes and composition. The Huambacho architectural canon appears fully de- veloped and is best illustrated by the use of the orthostatic wall building technique and interior colonnade forms. In Nepena, orthostatic walls and rectangular pillars were also documented by the Proyecto de Rescate Arqueologico CHINECAS at VN-35 and VN-36 in the Sute Bajo area (Cotrina et al. 2003 : 9). These architectural forms were not</page><page sequence="17">Journal of Field Archaeolqgy/Vol. 31, 2006 17 Figure 13. South profile of the south section of A-5/HA, Huaca-A Complex, showing the superposition of three occupation floors, the composition of the architectural fill, and the location of a dated carbon sample. limited to the Nepena Valley; cases have been reported from other Early Horizon sites on the north- central coast of Peru. In the Santa Valley, as in Nepena, most Early Horizon (Cayhuamarca Phase) sites were established in the middle and upper sections of the valley (Wilson 1988: 100-140), but Las Huacas, a valley floor complex is locat- ed in the lower Santa Valley (Cardenas 1979: 10). Clearing of the Edificio de las Pilastras, radiocarbon dated to 1840 ± 70 b.p. and 1930 ± 70 b.p. (Ziolkowski et al. 1994: 399-402), revealed more than 20 pillars built of stone and mud mortar forming a large rectangular patio room (Car- denas 1979: 11, fig. 12). In Casma, the sites of San Diego and Pampa Rosario were major settlements built around the beginning of the Early Horizon. Test pits yielded ceramics diagnostic of the Early Horizon and confirmed by radiocarbon dates. San Diego is dated between 2510 ±115 b.p. and 2245 ± 60 b.p. and Pampa Rosario between 2760 ± 75 b.p., and 2400 ± 70 b.p. (Pozorski 1987: 17). Interconnected units of stone-walled enclosures, plazas, corridors, and low plat- form mounds have been described from these sites and ex- cavations revealed the presence of rectangular pillars at San Diego. Also at San Diego, the remains of wattle and daub dwellings suggest the site was an extensive habitation cen- ter (Pozorski and Pozorski 1987a: 51-65). There may also be architectural similarities with Early Horizon sites in the Huarmey Valley, directly south of Casma (Pozorski 1987: 29; Thompson 1966). Further south, excavations and sur- face reconnaissance at the site of Chimu Capac in the Supe Valley have brought to light the remains of pillars, dated to the Early Horizon occupation phase of the site, and inter- preted by Lisa Valkenier (1995: 275) as similar to those found at San Diego. The evidence available suggests that a number of Early Horizon sites in coastal Peru, and especially in the Casma- Nepena-Santa drainages, shared a typical architectural lay- out of rectilinear interior colonnades. Further connections between these neighboring populations are evidenced by strong similarities that exist between their artifact assem- blages-notably ceramic panpipes and discs, slate artifacts, stone bowls, and anthracite mirrors. In Nepena, the evi- dence from Huambacho indicates many similarities with the Initial Period tradition of architecture as exemplified at Cerro Blanco and Punkuri; as outlined by Larco (1966: 52, 61), these two sites apparently had close ties with north coastal Cupisnique populations. Many Cupisnique centers have been reported on the north coast (fig. i): Huaca Lucia in the La Leche Valley</page><page sequence="18">1 8 Early Horizon Architecture at Huambacho, Nepena Valley, Peru/Chkoine (Shimada, Elera, and Shimada 1983); Purulen in the Zaria Valley (Alva 1988); Puemape, Montegrande, and Tem- bladera in the Jequetepeque Valley (Elera 1998; Keatinge 1980; Tellenbach 1986); Casa Grande in the Chicama Val- ley; and Caballo Muerto and Huaca de los Chinos in the Moche Valley (Pozorski 1976; Watanabe 1979). Cupis- nique ceremonial centers are generally organized around a series of relatively low platform mounds with forecourts. The most distinctive architectural feature of the Cupis- nique tradition is probably the use of conical adobes, as well as rectangular and/or cylindrical pillars. Examples of Cupisnique colonnaded architecture have been reported from Huaca Lucia (Shimada 1986: 168, fig. 8.3), Purulen, Montegrande, Casa Grande, Caballo Muerto (or Huaca de los Reyes) (Pozorski 1980: 101), and Huaca de los Chinos. For example, excavations at Huaca de los Reyes revealed that the access to the main ceremonial mound was com- plemented by colonnades of rectangular pillars which sup- ported a roof and masked a doorway (Pozorski 1983). At Casa Grande rectangular clay pillars decorated with poly- chrome relief paintings were photographed by Paul Kosok (1965: 109, fig. 32). Similar examples have also been re- ported from Initial Period sites on the north-central coast. In Nepena, Tello reported the existence of clay pillars from the earliest structures at Cerro Blanco and Punkurf. At Punkurf, for instance, the pillars were square-shaped, mea- suring 42 cm on a side, and decorated with painted reliefs (Antunez de Mayolo 1933). Furthermore, recent field- work at Huaca Partida has revealed cylindrical pillars made of canes and clay, along with polychrome mural paintings (Koichiro Shibata, personal communication 2005), remi- niscent of those encountered at the Initial Period sites of Taukachi-Konkan (Mound of the Columns) and Sechin Al- to in Casma (Pozorski and Pozorski 2002: 25-31, 40-41). By contrast, examples of colonnaded architecture are gen- erally rare at sites in the highlands, limited to the monu- mental cylindrical stone pillars found at Chavfn-related sites. Preliminary analysis thus suggests a reconsideration of the relationship between Initial Period local groups based at Cerro Blanco and Punkurf and subsequent Early Hori- zon populations. Notwithstanding many differences from previous Initial Period centers- such as the lack of conical adobes, the disappearance of a central axis and the absence of feline-related motifs- Huambacho architects drew up- on a number of earlier, local architectural concepts and ideas. The most conspicuous are the use of the orthostatic technique and the erection of rectangular pillars, but also includes the innovative utilization of decorative clay cones in public art. This analysis challenges previous interpreta- tions about the origins of Early Horizon groups on the north-central coast and suggests that Early Horizon pat- terns of architecture in Nepena are not without local an- tecedents. In Nepena, the construction of Huambacho's distinc- tive interior colonnaded architecture apparently followed the abandonment of the temples of Punkurf and Cerro Blanco. This is paralleled in Casma where, by the begin- ning of the 1st millennium B.C., most Initial Period com- plexes had been abandoned (Pozorski 1987: 23). The Ini- tial Period sites are best characterized by massive central mounds, central staircases, aligned circular sunken plazas, and lateral mounds reminiscent of the U-shaped tradition of the central coast (see Burger 1987; Williams 1985). These were superseded by a multitude of enclosure com- plexes. Initial Period centers, both on the coast and in the high- lands, tended to focus on a single building or monument which was ritually entombed and renovated at different in- tervals in time (Burger 1992: 92). In contrast, the Huam- bacho data indicate an emphasis on multiple enclosed cer- emonial spaces. Overall, the presence of multiple sunken plazas, raised mounds with distinct sub-compounds, and graded access suggests a fragmentation in the ritual prac- tices of certain Early Horizon groups. Extensive sampling could identify only three successive building programs at any one locality, and the Proyecto Huambacho recovered no evidence, such as offerings, attesting to the ritual en- tombment of earlier structures. Rather, the remodeling of architectural features and the expansion of the ceremonial complex utilized rubbish as construction fill. Compared to those in the Initial Period, Early Horizon public building projects were relatively modest in size and probably served only local needs; for example, the two sunken plazas at Huambacho covered an area of less than 10,000 sq m while one of the plazas at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke covered almost 200,000 sq m (Moore 1996: 152, based on Pozorski and Pozorski 1986: 384, fig. 2). It is clear that the sociocultural landscape of the Initial Period-Early Horizon cultural transition in Nepena is more complex than previously envisaged. For instance, it is apparent that some communities in the lower Nepena did not take part in the Chavfn religious network and devel- oped very distinct patterns of ceremonial architecture (Burger 1993: 67); as such, the north-central coast of Pe- ru is a key area to study cultural variability during the Ear- ly Horizon. While some settlements had prominent Chavfn ties, such as Pallka in the upper Casma Valley (Tel- lo 1956), it is clear that coeval neighboring centers, such as Huambacho, show negligible evidence of Chavfn influ- ence. Neither U-shaped structures nor circular sunken pits, the two principal Chavfn architectural traits, were docu-</page><page sequence="19">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 19 merited during the excavations. Clay friezes at Huambacho have geometric motifs, such as steps and zigzag designs, and marine-related themes; no Chavin related iconograph- ic elements could be recognized in mural sculptures and paintings. The Early Horizon is seen by many archaeologists as a time of widespread socioeconomic and military insecurity on the north-central coast (Daggett 1984; Pozorski and Pozorski 1987a; Proulx 1985; Wilson 1988). Most sites are located in the upper sections of valleys and research has mainly targeted ridge-top settlements and defensive forti- fications. These sites are often interpreted as an index of so- cio-political instability or as the single largest output of public labor during the Early Horizon (e.g., Burger 1992: 188). At Huambacho, this view is supported by the focus on the closing of space and more restrictive access to the Main Compound. A basic concern for keeping people out- side certain spaces seems to have existed, but Huambacho cannot be considered a prototypical defensive site (Topic and Topic 1987: 48-50). Despite apparent organizational differences with previous Initial Period centers, the pres- ence of enclosed public spaces indicates that Early Horizon societies in the lower Nepena did continue to build and make use of monumental ceremonial architectural com- plexes. Innovations in public architecture seem to mark a clear shift in local ceremonial life and probably reflect deep- er changes in the social organization. This research shows the necessity for large-scale hori- zontal clearing as a means of defining and further under- standing architecture and suggests the degree to which cer- emonial and religious variability characterized the Early Horizon. Excavations at Huambacho bring new insights to a previously understudied architectural tradition, and provide evidence that expands our understanding of cul- tural variability and innovation in early coastal Peru.

I owe many thanks to Victor Pimentel Spissu and Jeisen Navarro Vega who co-directed the 2003 and 2004 field seasons respec- tively. I am also indebted to members of the field crew, es- pecially France-Eliane Dumais, Alexandra Taillon-Pellerin, and Carol Rojas Vega. Fieldwork could not have been completed without the support and participation of the modern community of Huambacho El Arenal. Preliminary versions of the manuscript benefited from insightful com- ments by George Lau, Jean-Francois Millaire, Richard Deswarte, and Andrew Mills. Finally, suggestions from Richard Burger and two anonymous reviewers were of great value in shaping the final version of the paper. David Chicoine is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of East Anglia and has worked in coastal Peru since 1998. His inter- ests include architecture, the dynamics of ancient political sys- tems, the development of sociocultural complexity, and visual culture in the Andes.
