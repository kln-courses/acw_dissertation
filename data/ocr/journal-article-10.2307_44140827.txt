<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC NÄGA FIGURES FROM GUJARAT. By Shri R. Mehta. Ophilatory is practised in India from very early period as evi- denced by literature and Monuments. The long standing tradition of Nāga worsip is responsible for the development of complex mytho- logy found in the religious texts of the Hindus, Buddhists and the Jains. Various myths preserved by them suggest that the Nāgas are conceived as having the body of a serpent; but they have the power to take the shape of any human.1 animal2 or inanimate object.8 In their malevolent aspect they destroy men, birds beasts and trees by their sting, breath or sight or steal various precious objects, and put human beings to trouble. But in their benevolent aspect they protect</page><page sequence="2">ANCIENT INDIA (SECTION i) 161 men from rain, storm, heat, poison and öther troubles. They guard the wealth and the household, and are believed to be the incarnations of the manes. They grant children and wealth to their worshippers. Their main abode is in the underworld but move in the three regi- ons; in their abode they have luxurious palaces and fine surroundings. Their women folk is depicted as extremely lovely and marry from time to time with human heros. Analysing these complex Nāga personalities. Barth mentions4 that their worship has the following characteristics. t (1) Direct adoration of the animal. (2) Worship of the deities of waters, springs and rivers symbolized by the waving from of the serpent. (3) Conceptions of the same kind as that of Vedic Ahi, and connected closely with the great myth of the storm and struggle of light with Darkness. The worship of Nāgas and numerous legends connected with it have lead to the development of their sculptures. Naga sculptures are found in the art of India throughout the ages, and in all the pro- vinces. Typologically the Nāga figures could be subdivided into the following three main division: - ( 1 ) Theriomorphic representation. (2) Anthropomorphic representation. (3) Therio- Anthropomorphic representation. The theriomorphic variety is fairly widespeard in tittie and space. It is either monocephalic or polvcephalic with three, five seven or more expanded hoods. The body in this variety shows coils of various types. The second variety has the following three forms : - (a) Human beings with serpent hoods on the turban or top of the head. The hoods ranging from a single one to three, five, seven or more. They appear to spring from the neck of the individual or from the back or are decorations on turbans. This variety is also fairly wide spread and is commonly met with in the aft of Ancient India.</page><page sequence="3">162 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS (b) In this variety human figure is seen in the front. On the sides of the human figure, the coils of serpent are visible; on the back also the coils of the serpent are seen from the feet upto the shoulders, and from this point springs the polycephalic hoods in the form of a halo. This is rather a rare variety. Its earliest specimen are possibly from around Mathura. G. Ph. Vogel remarks that, "In most of the Nāga images from Mathura it is quite clear that the hood is not con- ceived as an excrescence springing from the back of the human frame. It forms a part of a complete serpent whose coils are plainly visible both at the front and the back of the sculpture."5 One of the image of this type discovered from Chhargaon is dated in the 40th vear of the Kushāņaera and was erected near a pond in the reign of Hu- vishka. This fact suggests that such independent cult images were possibly manufactured for the first time in Indian art at Mathura in the early centuries of Christian era. (c) Only human figures identified as Nāgas from the circumstan- tial evidence of their being attacked by Garuda, their arch enemy. This is rather a rare type mainly found in the Gāndhāra school.6 The third variety has the upper part in human form and the lower part in the form of a snake. This also is a very common type seen at many sites. From Gujarat all the varieties are known, but the sub type G of variety 2 is unknown. Here the two images of variety 2 and subtype A B are noted. The sub type 'A' was first published by U. P. Shah in Kumar.7 It is a fine marble figure of a young man sitting in lalitāsana, with his right leg resting on a seat. He holds flower in his right hand,' whereas his left hand rests on his thigh. Near the left shoulder is a lotus flower on a stalk. He puts on yajnopavîta; bracelets, arm- lets and Kuņdalas made of spherical beads which mav be pearls. His hair is suggested to have been well combed. On his head are seen three hoods of snake, each having two large round eyes. The construction of the headdress is reminiscent of heavy chignons known from the figures which could be dated to Gircą. 7th or 8th centurv of Christian era, f</page><page sequence="4">ANCIÈNT INDIA (SECTION i) 163 In front of the seat of this Nāga are seen the figures of Nāga and Nāgini of variety 3. Their lower portion is enterwined forming a reef knot. This Nāga with simple halo, roundish compassionate face with plump cheeks and well proportioned youthful body full of vitality and grace resembles stylistically to such figures as Bhairava from Baroda, Jina of the figure ascribed to Jinabhadragani. Kshamasramana, and those from Idar area. These figures have been dated to 7th or 8th century on paléographie and stylistic grounds, hence it is reaso- nable to agree with U. P. Shah who assigns it to the 7th century A. D. The variety 'B' is represented by the highly worn out sandstone figure recently discovered by the author from Pavi Jetpur, Jabugam taluka, Baroda District. Its head is mutilated. The front of this figure depicts a standing human being with the right hand in Abhaya- mudrā and the left holding an indistinct roundish object which might be a Kamaņdalu or a flower. The torso of the figure is plain, but on its lion is seen a girdle of two strings, and loop of garment (?) in the front. On the back is seen the body of snake meandering from the bottom to the top. The reptile is very well shown by the scales of the animal. At the five loops in the body of the snake the stone is perforated. Such figures are apparently not seen in the Indian art preceeding that of Kushāņas, but from Mathura area they are found to exist from this period, as indicated by the Nāga figure from Chhargaon, a village, 5 miles south of Mathura. It is very likely therefore that the Jetpur figure is not earlier than the Kushāņa period, but follows the tradition of Mathura school, hence it could not be ascribed to a period earlier than 2nd Century A. D. The style, developed at Mathura, seems to have spread over a large area as can be inferred from the Sundarpada images of Nāga and Nāginis'8 The Pot-bellied, heavy human figure of the Nāga and heavily dressed massive figures of the Nāginis are reminiscent of the Yaksha and Yakshi figures of the earlier type. But the method of treatment of snake is much nearer the Mathura figures These figures appafently had inspiration from very well made Mathura</page><page sequence="5">164 INDIAN HISTORY CONGŘESS images, and hence they point to the fusion of the Nāga motif from Mathura and the older tradition of Yaksha figures. These figures therefore seem to have been carved in 2nd or 3rd Century A. D. under the influence of Mathura motif. Towards Gujarat also this very motif inspired the carving of the Jetapura Nāga. Here the techinique of perforating the loops seems to have been an innovation that is not seen on the Kukargaon or Ghhargaon images. This developed technique and dress suggests that this figure is rather later in date. The tradition established at Mathura seems to have existed at least upto 6th or 7th Centuries if not later as can be judged by the seated Nāga figure from Nālandā. In comparision with this Nālandā figure, Jetpura Nāga shows earlier treatment of dress and body hence one is tempted to put it to an earlier period than the Nālandā image. The circumstantial evidence of the find-spot of the figure also helps to arrive at the date of this figure. The findsopt is a small mound about 50' square and rising to a height of about ten feet from the adjoining field on the right bank of the river Orsang. This mound is full of bricks. The brick bats here measured 12" X 11" x 2 +21." In absence of the availibility of a complete brick, it is difficult to measure its actual size. But these brick bats suggest that its original is larger than 12." In this part of the country the bricks larger thanl2" have been discovered from the layers of early historic periodi i.e. from the beginning of Christian era to about 6th Cent. A.D. From this mound some sculptures of Goddesses, and Kärtikeya, assignable to about 5th or 6th Centuries of Christian era on stylistic evidence have also been recovered. The evidence of the mound and sculptures therefore point that the figure belongs to the early historic period I. The stylistic affi- nities show the influence of the Mathura school powerful under the Kushāņas. The sculpture therefore belongs to the early historic perid I. 1.
