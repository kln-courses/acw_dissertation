<plain_text><page sequence="1">Night-Vision: Epicurean Eschatology ANDREA NIGHTINGALE JL/ucRETius invites us to see in the dark. The atoms and void that constitute the universe are, he claims, obscura (1.136). The atoms create concrete visible things, yet are themselves invisible. Lucretius translates Epicurus' theory into lucid Latin verse. As he puts it: I spend the tranquil nights in wakefulness, seeking what words and what poetry will enable me to spread clear lights (clara . . . lumina) before your mind, by which you can see deeply into the darkness of things (res quibus occultas penitus convisere). (1.14 2-4 5) In principle, Lucretius should be a "tranquil" Epicurean, but he spends his nights awake with (anxious?) creativity, at? tempting to shed light on dark things. He addresses his poem to a man called Memmius, whom he encourages to "see" the hidden truths of Epicureanism: "you yourself will be able to see {videre) one thing after another in these matters and creep into all the dark coverts {caecas latebras) and drag out the truth from there" (1.407-9). Lucretius boasts that he is "composing such lucid poems about a subject so dark {ob? scura de . . . reY (1.933-34; cf. 922), but he makes it clear that he is closely following in his master's footsteps. Epicu? rus, after all, was the "first man able to raise a light so clear {tarn darum . . . lumen) out of such great darkness {tenebris tantis), illuminating {inlustrans) the goods of life" (3.1-2). Lucretius wants his readers to "see" the dark realm of the atomic universe: only "night-vision" (as I will call it) will lead them to learn and enact Epicurean philosophy and thereby achieve a tranquil, pleasurable life. Of course darkness con? jures up another, competing form of night: the horrors of the ARION 14.3 WINTER 2OO7</page><page sequence="2">62 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY "blackness of death" (mortis nigrore, 3.38).I Lucretius fa? mously argues against the fear of death. He urges his readers to go gentle into that good night, since the putative night of death is not a black pit of hell but the senselessness of invisi? ble, dispersed atoms. Of course, death lacks the temporality of a night, since it takes the person beyond time, beyond night and day. For all humans, death is the end of consciousness, time, and indeed the self. For the person who has lost a loved one, that death takes place in time and belongs to the realm of consciousness and language: the bereaved must recreate his or her own narrative as well as the narrative of the dead person. But, for the dead person, time and narrative come to an end. For each individual, then, his or her own death is nothing to fear since there will be nothing?no-one?to experience fear, pain, or consciousness after death. Death, then, is a no-brainer. But it takes a lot of brain work to get to the point of accepting the dying of one's light without rage or fear. Epicurus is the mastermind of this proj? ect: he creates an atomic theory that offers people a pleasur? able and serene life "in the present," freeing them from fear and anxiety about the future. According to Lucretius, Epicu? rus sheds light on the "dark" and "obscure" atomic realm, and enables people to comprehend the finitude of the human being as well as the infinity of atoms and void. Lucretius fol? lows Epicurus very closely, but he presents Epicurean philos? ophy in poetic and metaphoric discourse that offers a concrete "view" of the atomic realm. In this essay, I will ex? plore Lucretius' poetics of "night-vision" and its connection to death and temporality. I want to examine how the vision of the atomic world leads one to adopt a lifestyle devoted to pleasure and tranquillity. I will then outline an Epicurean "narrative of pleasure" that is designed to enable people to experience ongoing pleasure in the midst of bodily vicissi? tudes and the ravages of time.</page><page sequence="3">Andrea Nightingale 63 I. EPICURUS' THEORIA near the opening of the poem, Lucretius describes Epicu? rus' heroic journey into the universe of atoms and void, where he discovers the truth about the nature of things: A man of Greece was the first to dare to lift his mortal eyes against . . . religion (religi?), which displayed its head from the regions of heaven . . . and to take an opposing stand. ... He desired to break through the confining bars of nature's gates. The lively power of his mind was victorious, and he travelled {procedit) far beyond the flaming walls of the world and journeyed {peragravit) the bound? less whole with his intellect and mind. And, as a victor, he brings back to us (refert nobis) the facts about what can come into being, and what cannot; what law defines the finite power for each thing and what constitutes its deep-set boundary stone.2- (1.63-77) Lucretius depicts a journey of the mind?a journey into an invisible region, since "the physical eye cannot perceive atoms" (1.270). The journey is, of course, spatialized: the mind goes "beyond the walls of the world." In the midst of the boundless Epicurean universe, our world?whose "flam? ing walls" are marked by the circle of the fixed stars?is but a tiny portion of infinite space. The image of a journey be? yond the walls of the world metaphorically symbolizes an intellectual trip into the invisible world of atoms and void. One could say that it is a trip into darkness, since the atoms are "obscure," "hidden," and "dark." As Lucretius reminds us, atoms exist in "blind darkness": "since colors cannot ex? ist without light, and the first-beginnings of things [i.e., atoms] do not emerge into light, you may be sure that they are in no way covered in color. For what color could there be in blind darkness {caeeis . . . tenebris)}" (2. 795-99).3 Lucretius' account of Epicurus' intellectual journey conjures up?and may be based on?Plato's Allegory of the Cave. In the Allegory, the philosopher journeys from the darkness of the cave into the radiant region of the Forms. Plato identifies the cave as the physical world: the mouth of the cave marks</page><page sequence="4">64 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY the boundary between the physical and the metaphysical realm. The philosopher crosses that boundary, moving from the visible, physical world into the metaphysical region of the Forms. That region is not seen by the physical eye, but is vis? ible to the "eye of the mind," which itself is not a physical substance. The mind is a metaphysical entity that journeys to? wards things which are "akin" to it, i.e., the incorporeal Forms. This famous Platonic passage, as I have suggested else? where, depicts a theoriaA Traditionally, a theoria was a pil? grimage to a panhellenic religious festival; a person made this journey in order to witness spectacles and religious rituals. The theoria took the form of a round-trip journey: the theo ros?a pilgrim/civic ambassador?travelled to the festival, witnessed the spectacles, and returned as a messenger bringing news and information back to the city. In Plato's transforma? tion of traditional theoria, the philosophic theoros journeys even farther abroad, since he "travels" beyond the physical world. He too makes a round-trip journey: he "sees" the "spectacles of truth" and brings this vision of the reality of the Forms back to the (ignorant) people at home. Epicurus' journey follows the same pattern: his mind "travels" beyond the boundaries of the visible world? "breaking through the confining bars of nature's gates"? and discovers an invisible realm of atoms and void. The bars of nature's gates symbolize the boundary between the visible atomic compounds and the invisible atomic realm. They are the gates into the invisible. Nature "confines" us in the visi? ble realm of atomic compounds and prevents us from seeing the atoms that form the world. But Epicurus breaks through that boundary, journeying outside of the visible realm to dis? cover the truth about the universe. Like Plato's theorist, Epi? curus "sees" true reality and returns home with the news: he "brings back to us the facts about what can come into being, and what cannot." Epicurus, then, undertakes a philosophic theoria. But his journey differs from that of Plato in several crucial ways. He does enter into the invisible realm, but his mind is a corporeal entity, and the things that he "sees"</page><page sequence="5">Andrea Nightingale 6$ there are not metaphysical beings. As he discovers, there is no metaphysical region at all, since the entire universe is made up of physical atoms. While Plato's philosopher sees "divine," superhuman realities, Epicurus finds subhuman atoms. Epicurus, in fact, makes an assault on religion and its gods (for this reason, his theoria has a military aspect). And here, finally, is the most obvious difference between the two philosophers: Plato's theorist journeys into the light, whereas Epicurus travels into an obscure, dark region. The invisible realm of atoms is a region without light. For this, a person needs night-vision. 2. LUCRETIUS' THEORIA lucretius undertakes a theoria similar to that of his mas? ter. Indeed he claims that he follows Epicurus' exact itiner? ary: "I place my foot in the marks left by your feet" (3.4). Lucretius makes the Epicurean journey and "sees" the atoms and void beyond the walls of the world: Once your reason, arising from a godlike mind, begins to proclaim the nature of things, the terrors of the mind flee, the walls of the world part asunder, and I see {video) things happening throughout the entire void. The majesty of the gods appear and their quiet abodes, which neither winds shake nor clouds wet with rain? storms, nor does snow hardened into sharp frost, with its white fall, do violence, but the ever-cloudless air serves as a roof, and it laughs in the light spread afar.' Moreover, nature supplies every? thing and nothing detracts from the peace of mind at any time. But nowhere do the regions of Acheron appear, and the earth does not obstruct the view of all things being seen {omnia dispiciantur), whatever is going on below in the void under my feet. From these things a certain divine pleasure and dread/awe {horror) seizes me because, by your power, nature has become so manifest, exposed, and uncovered in every part. (3.14-30) When we read this passage, we find something quite new: though he follows Epicurus' "footsteps," Lucretius "sees" (at</page><page sequence="6">66 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY least in part) a luminous spectacle. In this strange passage, Lucretius offers two different visions: the vision of the bright abodes of the gods, and the vision of the invisible atoms ("all that is going on below in the void"). The night-vision of the atoms stands side by side with the "light-vision" of a radiant region inhabited by gods. Let us focus first on the gods?the light-vision. Note, first of all, that the "majesty" of the gods appears, but the gods themselves are otherwise absent. In fact, most of the passage focuses on the "abodes" of the gods. After the first line, there is no further mention of the gods themselves. After de? scribing the "abodes," Lucretius claims that "nature sup? plies everything and nothing detracts from the peace of mind at any time." The gods are oddly absent in this impersonal sentence. To be sure, Lucretius depicts a "place" where one can dwell in divine bliss. But, in this strange scene, there is no description of the gods, and no action at all. Except that air laughs! The laughter of the air brings us to a crucial point: six lines in this passage are a direct imitation of Homer. 5 I have highlighted Lucretius' imitation of Homer by putting these lines in quotation marks in the passage above. What are we to make of this Homeric allusion? When Lucretius has at? tacked the Greek and Roman gods repeatedly?following Epicurus' assault on religion?why would he bring in Homer's gods as a model for his description of a new kind of god? Lucretius imitates Homer's lines very closely?the ref? erence is impossible to miss. Oddly, however, Lucretius leaves out the last line of Homer's passage: "there the blessed gods enjoy pleasure all their days" (terpontai makares theoi ernata panta). This line would work well if Lucretius had intended to bring in the gods themselves. But he did not bring them in. Instead he describes a "place" where beings experience complete tranquillity.6 Lucretius puts a great deal of emphasis on the abodes of the gods?he conjures up a place of dwelling that features complete tran? quillity. This is an explicit gesture towards the issue of</page><page sequence="7">Andrea Nightingale 67 dwelling. Lucretius takes seriously the problems?and possi? bilities?of dwelling happily in a realm made up of atoms and void. How should we interpret Lucretius' imitation of Homer? According to one interpretation, Lucretius invokes Homer in order to distinguish the Epicurean gods from traditional gods. Lucretius removes most of the anthropomorphic qual? ities of the Homeric gods and substitutes gods that do not act or suffer (as the Homeric gods do) but experience com? plete tranquillity. This theory is based on the assumption that Epicurus believed in the existence of gods.7 Recently, Long and Sedley have opposed this position. They have per? suasively argued that Epicurus did not claim that gods, in themselves, exist; rather, they are a projection of our minds. The gods, as Long and Sedley claim, "are the product of im? ages with human shape which enter our minds and form in us idealized impression of a supremely blessed existence . . . by [these images] converging in our minds, they become our gods."8 To review the debate over this issue is beyond the scope of this essay. Let me emphasize, instead, that Lu? cretius' account of the gods in this passage is highly poetic and metaphorical.? Clearly, Lucretius is using Homeric po? etry to remind the reader that this passage on the poet's "vi? sion of a divine region" is poetic and mythic, and should not be read literally. Lucretius' mythic passage on the divine abodes, one could argue, functions as a symbol of a tranquil life. The poet invites his readers to imagine a region of dwelling where exceptional beings can achieve complete tranquillity. Since Lucretius calls Epicurus himself a "god" (5.8), it is easy to interpret the gods as ideals that one must strive for. In fact, Lucretius (following Epicurus) explicitly claims that one must strive to achieve this ethical model and live "like a god."10 Lucretius' account of his "vision" of a radiant region of divine abodes seems a deliberate echo of Plato's Allegory of the Cave. For this reason, Lucretius makes one important change in the Homeric passage: he expands upon the "white</page><page sequence="8">68 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY splendor" of Homer's description of Mt. Olympus by adding light ("the light spread afar": diffuso lumine). Unlike Epicu? rus' theoria in book i, then, part of Lucretius' theoria is a vi? sion of light. This "light vision" signifies the positive pay-off of the "vision" of the dark realm of atoms, i.e., ataraxia and a pleasurable life. As I have suggested, the "light-vision" in Lucretius' theoria in book three sits side by side with a very different vision of the world. Lucretius has made it clear that the discovery of the radiant and serene abodes is based on a direct "vision" of the invisible, "obscure" atoms. It is for this reason that Lucretius' vision of light is accompanied by a depiction of the dark and hidden atomic realm. Light-vi? sion is dependent on good and sound night-vision. Immedi? ately following his description of the gods and their abodes, Lucretius says: But nowhere do the regions of Acheron appear, and the earth does not obstruct the view of all things being seen (omnia dispiciantur), whatever is going on below in the void under my feet. From these things a certain divine pleasure and dread/awe (horror) seizes me because, by your power, nature has become so manifest, exposed, and uncovered in every part. (3.25-30) In this part of Lucretius' theoria, we move from light-vision to night-vision. Lucretius sees "through" the solid earth be? low him and gets a vision of the invisible universe of atoms and void ("whatever is going below in the void under my feet"). As Segal puts it, "the poet's feet seem suspended over the vast nothingness of void thus opened beneath him."11 In looking down into the void, then, Lucretius moves beyond the boundaries of composite, visible entities (the earth, etc.) and enters into a region where there are no boundaries. There is just an infinity of atoms and void. The visible world is defined by composites that have shapes and boundaries. Even the world itself has boundaries (as Epicurus explains, "a world is a certain envelopment of a heaven. It envelops celestial bodies, an earth, and the whole range of phenom? ena. It is cut off from the infinite, and terminates in a</page><page sequence="9">Andrea Nightingale 69 limit"12). To make a mental journey beyond the "walls of the world," as I have suggested, is to leave the composite, visible world that is "cut off from the infinite" and enter into the boundless invisible realm. It is no surprise that Lu? cretius experiences pleasure and fearful awe when he "sees" this infinite universe. Lucretius' theoria turns out to be a ma? jor head-trip: this vision of dark, "obscure" things nearly boggles his mind. In seeing the dark, invisible realm of atoms and void, one perceives the basis of one's own life and death. One sees that the infinity of the atoms creates life, but also brings about death. To some extent, what one sees in atomic "night-vi? sion" is the fact about human death?that death is the final limit for human individuals. Epicurus, of course, considers this good news: one can be tranquil if one accepts one's fini tude and learns to enjoy the pleasures at hand rather than striving for things that one can never have. But, before reaching this optimistic ethical theory, one must wrestle with the dark. Only when one achieves a full understanding ("vi? sion") of the atomic realm can one develop what Long calls an "objective self": "this comes into operation when we try to think of the world from a perspective in which we treat our personal identity not as a privileged viewpoint but merely as one of the things that the world contains along with everything else."^ The atomic theory, according to Epicurus, provides the foundation of an ethical philosophy centered on pleasure and happiness. To be sure, the "night vision" of invisible atoms whirling in an opaque void may not seem to offer a secure or stable basis for a happy mode of life (quite the con? trary!). But the atomic theory contains the "true" fact that human life has specific temporal and spatial limits; identify? ing these limits, these boundaries of life, Epicurus developed the art of the possible. Humans cannot attain eternal life or infinite pleasures. But they can achieve a pleasurable life if they accept the facts on the ground (so to speak).</page><page sequence="10">70 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY 3- INTERTEXTUALITIES i want to turn now to another passage on night-vision in the De Rerum Natura. I quote the entire passage because it can only be understood in its intertextual relation to several other philosophic works: Nothing is ever so easily understood but that which, at first, is dif? ficult to believe, and nothing is so great and wonderful that, bit by bit, all men will cease to wonder at it. To begin, the clear, pure color of the heaven, and all it contains?the wandering stars, the moon, and the brightness of the sun with its dazzling light?if all these things were, suddenly and unexpectedly (ex improviso . . .re? pente), cast before mortal eyes for the first time, what could be more marvellous (mirabile) than this, what would man have less dared to believe existed beforehand? Nothing, as I think: so won? drous (miranda) would have been that sight. But now no one thinks it worthwhile to look up at the lucid temples of the heavens, since they are wearied by the satiety of seeing it. (2.1026-38) The lines that follow this passage introduce an abrupt change of scene: Do not, then, be terrified by the novelty (novitate) itself [of my ideas] and cast reason out of your mind, but ponder all the more with keen judgment. . . . Since the sum of space is infinite abroad, outside the walls of the world, the mind seeks to understand what there is in the distance whither the intellect continually desires to look forth (prospicere) and whither the projection of the mind itself freely flies. In the first place, in all those parts around us in every direction and on both sides, above and below, throughout the uni? verse, there is no limit (finis). (2.1040-50) Interestingly, the shift from the sight of the radiant heavens to the account of the dark atomic universe moves from the discourse of "wonder" (mirabile, miranda) to that of fear (novitate exterritus): the poet worries that his new theory will seem to be frightening rather than merely amazing. He</page><page sequence="11">Andrea Nightingale 71 hopes, however, that the reader will become familiar with his theory and, in time, cease to be amazed and afraid. This complicated passage, as we will see, is based on an Aris? totelian dialogue?now preserved only in fragments?which it alludes to but also transforms. To understand Lucretius' atomic "vision," we must turn to an Aristotelian myth. As Clay has shown, the connection between Lucretius' passage and Aristotle's dialogue is revealed in the second book of Cicero's De natura deorumM In Cicero's text, the Stoic character Balbus, attacking the Epicurean claim that the world is formed by "random" movements of atoms, quotes a fascinating passage from Aristotle's dialogue, On Philosophy. This passage contains a muthos that imitates and transforms Plato's Allegory of the Cave: Suppose there were men who had always lived underground . . . Suppose, however, that they had never gone above ground, but had learned by report and hearsay that there was a divine spirit and power. Suppose then that, at some time, the jaws of the earth opened and they were able to escape and make their way from those hidden dwellings into these regions which we inhabit. When they suddenly saw earth and seas and skies . . . when they saw the sun . . . which fills the sky with light and makes the day; when, again, night darkened the lands and they saw the whole sky picked out and adorned with stars, and the varying light of the moon . . . and the rising and setting of all these heavenly bodies . . . when they saw those things, most certainly would they have judged both that there are gods and that these great works are the works of god. (Ci? cero, De natura deorum 2.3 7.9 5 )x 5 After quoting this Aristotelian passage, Cicero's Balbus pro? ceeds to ask his interlocutors to imagine a darkness as dense as the dust-cover produced by the eruption of Mt. Aetna, which engulfed the neighboring region in darkness for two full days. Balbus then turns to another example: "what if, af? ter a period of eternal darkness (ex aeternis tenebris), it hap? pened that suddenly (subito) we saw the light?what kind of heaven would be seen? But human minds are habituated by</page><page sequence="12">72 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY daily habits and by the familiarity of their eyes, and they don't marvel (admirantur) at this or ask the reason for the things that they always see, as if it were the novelty (novitas) and not rather the magnitude of things that ought to excite us to inquire about the causes" (2.37.96-97). Consider the intertextual references: first, Lucretius refers to Aristotle's dialogue (which, in turn, is based on the Alle? gory of the Cave). Later, Cicero refers both to Aristotle's and Lucretius' passages on the first sight of the heavens. In Aris? totle's myth, one finds the basic (Platonic) trope of the first amazing vision of the "true light" outside the cave. Lucretius uses this same trope, but adds the point that people marvel at the novelty of the first vision but cease to wonder at it af? ter becoming habituated to the sight. Cicero then picks up on both themes, referring to the two authors in the same passage (which reinforces the direct connection between them). As Clay has shown, Lucretius transforms the myth offered by Aristotle: in Aristotle, the people who see the light of heavens for the first time immediately believe in the exis? tence of gods and their creation of the world; in Lucretius, the humans' first vision of the bright heavens is compared to the first vision of the dark Epicurean universe, with its god? less atoms that create the world.16 Recall that, in the Lucretian passage, after describing the sudden vision of light, the poet abruptly changes the setting, directing an imperative to Memmius, his addressee: "Do not, then, be terrified by the novelty (novitate) itself [of my ideas] and cast reason out of your mind." This line picks up on the opening of the passage, where Lucretius says that new things are initially wonderful and shocking but eventually become familiar. Lucretius uses Aristotle's myth, in part, to show how something as wonderful as the first vision of the light after an eternal night becomes familiar over time. After presenting the basic details of Aristotle's "first vision of light" myth, Lucretius then turns to describe the new and wonderful vision of the atomic universe, which he believes will initially cause terror in the person who has never "seen"</page><page sequence="13">Andrea Nightingale 73 this thing. Ironically, Lucretius compares the first vision of the dark universe of atoms to the Aristotelian myth of the first epiphany of the shining sun and heavens for those living in a cave. It should be clear that, in his "vision" passages, Lucretius is playing with a familiar topos: a narrative of the achieve? ment of enlightenment. Lucretius makes important alter? ations in the topos, but maintains several key notions: the journey to wisdom (in the theoria in book 3) and the "Pla? tonic" vision of truth (in all the "vision" passages). Note that the journey of theoria in book 3 takes the form of a conversion narrative: the philosopher leaves behind the realm of untruth and ignorance, and travels to a distant re? gion, where he sees the reality of truth. Though this brief myth does not have much amplitude?compare, for exam? ple, Augustine's detailed narrative of conversion in the Con? fessions?it does contain one basic ingredient: the movement from a state of ignorance to an understanding of truth. Lu? cretius depicts the conversion of the philosopher to a new world-view, a new way of life; as he says in book three, his vision of truth evokes both pleasure and fear (voluptas . . . atque horror). A mature Epicurean will get beyond wonder and fear, but the unconverted (or new convert) is in a differ? ent position. Lucretius aims his poem at unconverted read? ers: it is a protreptic designed to persuade people to adopt Epicurean philosophy. In his efforts to convert the reader, Lucretius uses a number of poetic and rhetorical strategies. He conjures up fearful and wondrous scenes in the effort to slowly take the reader beyond fear and wonder. I want to look briefly at the rhetoric of conversion in Lucretius' poem (later in the paper, I will examine the life-narrative of a ma? ture Epicurean, which is very different from the narrative of conversion). As the passage above reveals, the newly converted Epi? curean must come to see the "truth" of atoms and void. This will seem, at first, vertiginous and even frightening. Lu? cretius himself admits that Epicurean theory is, itself, ob</page><page sequence="14">74 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY scure and a bit terrifying. As he says in the famous pro? grammatic statement of his poetic intents (1.921-50), Epi? curean theory is "obscure" and hard to swallow (922, 933). Lucretius himself will make this obscurity lucid, sweet, and palatable. Just as one can induce children to drink bitter medicine by putting honey on the rim of the cup, he will sweeten Epicurus' bitter-tasting theories with poetic verses. As Lucretius puts it: "since this doctrine often seems to be rather grim (tristior) [or is it "sad"??how ironici] to people who have not investigated these matters, and since common people shrink back from it in fear (retroque volgus abhorret ab hac)," he will set forth the doctrine in the honeyed lan? guage of the Muses (943-47). I find this interesting. Part of the Epicurean project is to dispel fear, yet the theory itself is, initially, fearful. The theory plays on fear even as it aims to remove it. Here, Lucretius seems to suggest that humans are afraid of truth. Lucretius is a brilliant psychologist. He fully understands that a new theory, based on a vision of infinite atoms and void, will be a fearful enterprise. He starts with the reader's fears, adding elements of wonder as he goes. Eventually, he will attempt to remove these fears. Lucretius offers "true" arguments against the fear of death and endeavors to re? move human "wonder" at natural forces such as thunder, lightening, earthquakes, and floods by explaining their atomic nature (book 6). He claims that the possession of these truths will dispel intellectual and emotional anxiety. Lucretius is aware that conversion takes time: he constantly worries that Memmius will find one or another element of his theory "fearful" or will "wonder" at nature rather than depart from wonder with the achievement of certainty. As Conte rightly argues, in Lucretius, "the rhetoric of marvel is replaced by a rhetoric of necessity (necesse est), which in fact is the contrary of the miraculous."^ Wonder must be re? placed by knowledge, fear and anxiety by serenity. Lucretius wants his readers to understand the nature of the atomic universe. They must accept that all physical bodies?includ</page><page sequence="15">Andrea Nightingale 75 ing their own?have limits, and they must adopt an ethical theory that brings pleasure for the small period of their life. The readers must look directly at their death, at the fact that they will eventually crumble into meaningless, senseless enti? ties. Humans need meaning: Epicurus offers a particular kind of meaningful life, but makes it clear that the human ability to have sense and meaning is derived from atomic "nonsense." As Lucretius puts it: "you must confess that all things that we see possessing sense necessarily consist of first-beginnings [= atoms] that have no sense"; "the sensible is born from insensible things" (2.865-67, 888). There is something both poignant and beautiful in this picture. Hu? mans must wrest meaning from a meaningless world?a world in which "it is possible for a person to laugh, having grown from things that do not laugh, and to be wise and reason with learned arguments, although coming from atoms that are not wise or eloquent themselves" (2.986-90). The human being lives in an infinite and unstable ocean of atomic nonsense. Starting from this precarious position, one must seek for a secure dwelling. 4. ESCHATOLOGY lucretius has much to say about limits and boundaries. Consider the following passage, which introduces yet an? other vision of the heavens: When we look up to the vast and ordered regions of sky, and ether studded with sparkling stars, and chance to think of the travels of sun and moon, then into our hearts, distraught by other troubles, this worry as well raises its head: are there gods whose power, be? yond our measure, sets the bright start to wheeling, each in its course? For the lack of knowledge troubles a mind in doubt: Did our world have a begetting and a beginning? And is there a limit, too, to which the walls of the world can bear the strain of this rest? less motion? (5.1204-14) Here, the vision of the heavens does not dazzle or amaze the</page><page sequence="16">76 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY viewer but, rather, generates anxiety and epistemic doubt. It raises basic existential and philosophical questions. In partic? ular, it focuses on the question of limits. Is there a limit, a boundary, to the universe as a whole? Does our world have a temporal and physical limit, or is it everlasting and unlim? ited? These questions about the limits of the world implicitly raise the question of the limit to human life. What are the limits of our bodies and our souls? Does the soul end in death, or is there an afterlife? The poem as a whole is a dis? course on the limits and boundaries of bodily beings. Lu? cretius' detailed descriptions of the porous boundaries of the human body, in fact, has led some scholars to discuss his phi? losophy as a therapy for "boundary anxiety."18 Following Epicurus, Lucretius clearly defines the limits of human life? the death of the body?as well as the unlimited nature of the universe. The walls of the world crumble, human souls and bodies disintegrate, but the sea of atoms "goes on."1? In the passage quoted above (5.1204-14), the vision of the bright heavenly bodies in the sky raises questions that one can only resolve by entering into the dark regions of the atomic universe. Lucretius' readers must "see" the atoms and void and the boundlessness of the universe. When hu? mans confront the infinity of atoms moving in an infinite universe, they bump up against their finitude. They come to understand the difference between the unlimited universe of atoms and the limited realm of human beings and other composite entities. When viewing boundless atoms, they see the boundaries of their lives. What can we say about this dis? tant, nonhuman "place" beyond the walls of the world? How does this affect one's conception of human life? Lucretius' discourse on "distant" places and other worlds, I argue, is a new kind of eschatology. Eschatology may be defined by a logos about the eschata, i.e., about things which are distant or at the edges of human space or time ("outer? most," "utmost," "farthest," "remotest"), or which serve as an end or limit to human life as we know it.20 Any narrative that explores the relation between human life in the present</page><page sequence="17">Andrea Nightingale 77 and a "distant" future, a "distant" past, or a "distant" pres? ent (i.e., a different temporality simultaneous with the hu? man present) is, by definition, eschatological. These "distant," nonhuman temporalities can only occur in a non human space: an alien, nonhuman "time" (heterochrony) is necessarily linked to an alien place (a heterotopia). The es? chatological narrative, I suggest, dislocates its audience by revealing an otherworldly reality which, in some way, is linked to human life. Ordinary human life is reconceived in relation to the existence and agency of certain nonhuman beings (e.g., metaphysical realities, gods, material forces). An eschatological narrative, then, evokes a "distant" time place zone that explores and/or reveals human limits and posits some nonhuman being as operating at the borders of the human subject. We generally associate the genre of eschatology with meta? physical discourses, i.e., Platonic or Christian narratives, in which metaphysical Forms and/or God mark the "edges" (the eschata) of the human and physical world. But the re? gions/beings beyond the human realm need not be defined by divine beings. For the eschata can be completely physical. Lucretius, I suggest, offers a materialist eschatology: he de? picts a journey beyond the human world into a "distant," nonhuman region constituted solely by material atoms and void. At the "edges" of the human are the nonhuman atoms. This is a new logos of a different kind of eschata. Lucretius offers a vision of a realm of "distant" beings beyond our borders which?from the human point of view?is hete rochronic and heterotopic. The universe beyond the walls of the world is temporally and physically infinite, and is thus alien to?"other than"?human life. The temporally and corporeally limited human confronts the alien realm of the unlimited, eternal universe of atoms. Lucretius' eschatology?like other texts in the genre? shows how entities existing beyond the human realm serve to define human life. These "edges" mark the limits of the human being, and in doing so, they impose ethical con</page><page sequence="18">78 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY straints. Consider how an eschatological story of a divine, metaphysical region existing "beyond" the human world in? vites people to define themselves. If one accepts this kind of narrative, one must identify oneself in relation to these di? vine beings, and see oneself as a soul that has an afterlife de? termined by a divine universe. These distant, metaphysical regions offer the human soul "shelter" in a disembodied state (a shelter which can be beatific or hellish, depending on how one lives). This scenario compels humans to treat the present in terms of the afterlife: they must live a life that en? ables them to obtain a good shelter after bodily death. Lu? cretius' materialist eschatology defines the human very differently. His discourse conjures up an infinite realm of subhuman matter that creates humans but also destroys them. It compels the readers to accept their finitude and give up fantasies or fears of an afterlife. The entities at the "edges" of the world offer no shelter for humans; quite the contrary, they determine one's final end?death and noth? ingness. The universe of atoms and void does not include humans but, rather, engulfs them. This, of course, affects one's conception of the present world one lives in. For a Pla tonist or Christian, the world is a place of exile, a vale of tears: it is not a home but a prison for punished people. The true home is in the realm of God or the Forms. For an Epi? curean, the world is the only home one has: it is a difficult place, but not a punishing prison. It is not a place of exile, but the only available place of shelter. Why, then, do we find it so hard to be at home here on earth? Well, to begin with, we have bodies that are extremely vulnerable to pain, disease, and death. As Epicurus famously said, "when it comes to death, we are a city without walls."21 We are, indeed, a city without walls from the moment we are born. Of course Epicurean philosophy offers a solution to this problem: one must "fortify" one's mind with true logos. If one fully understands and accepts Epicurean philosophy, one can learn to enjoy physical pleasures (in the correct measure) while minimizing physical pain and mental anxiety;</page><page sequence="19">Andrea Nightingale 79 one can enjoy the pleasures at hand and thus live a detached, tranquil life.22 Lucretius articulates the power of Epicurus' philosophy in a famous passage at the opening of book 2: one can "look down" on erring, confused people from "serene temples fortified (munita) by the doctrines of the wise" (2.7-10). We come back, then, to shelter. The Epi? curean lives pleasurably on earth in a comfortable (if tempo? rary) shelter: a detached and serene place that is "fortified" against the troubles of earthly life. A "shelter from the storm" (to borrow Dylan's famous line). 5. TIME AND NARRATIVE what sort of "fortified shelter" does the Epicurean dwell in? Let us begin with the mind, which experiences pains and pleasures that are manifold and different from those of the body. According to Epicurus, the mind experiences much more pain and difficulty than the body: Mental pains are much worse [than physical pains], since the pres? ent alone (to par on monon) assails the flesh, but the past, present, and future (to parelthon kai to par on kai to mell?n) [assail] the soul. (D.L. 10.136-37) Epicurus makes a crucial point here. For he suggests that it is not so much bodily pain itself as the mental consciousness that extends to past, present, and future pains (including death) which compounds and complicates simple pains ex? perienced in the present. Our experience of temporality? our consciousness of time?affects our experience of pain and loss. The mind grieves over the past, feels anxiety about the present, and fears the future: it dwells, so to speak, in multiple temporalities. The fact that the mind projects itself into the past and into the future?a projection which is the essence of human consciousness?creates particular existen? tial pains and problems. The human awareness of death and the consciousness of temporal change and the vagaries of the body make it diffi</page><page sequence="20">8o NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY cult?if not impossible?to "live in the present." Let me il? lustrate this point with a brief discussion of Augustine's analysis of temporality in the Confessions. As Augustine fa? mously argued, human life is "distended" in time. In our mental and conscious life, we are simultaneously pulled into the past (memoria) and into the future (expectation). We do not simply dwell in the present: indeed "no time is wholly present" (n.ii).23 As Augustine puts it, "life is a distention (distentid) in several directions" (11.29). We humans are self-conscious beings, aware of bodily transience; our minds continually drag us backwards and forwards, away from bodily presence. Augustine describes the human experience of distention as that of being "scattered in time"?scattered, because we are never stable, never in one temporal or spatial "place." As he claims, humans live in a sort of existential diaspora: our minds?our consciousness of time and death?estrange us from the simple presence of natural phenomena, offering us no real home on earth. The Christian, then, identified him? self as homeless on earth, and sought for a home elsewhere. As I have suggested, Christian eschatology presents a solu? tion to this existential problem: God offers humans a per? manent shelter in the afterlife, outside of time and nature.2^ Of course this "homecoming" occurs in a "future" which lies beyond time: "I can find no safe place to settle my soul in, but in you alone. There let my scattered pieces (sparsa) be gathered together, and from you let no part of me depart" (Confessions 10.40). In uniting with God in the afterlife, the Christian departs from the homelessness caused by the sins and sorrows of time, and by the sinful, "unnatural" body. How, then, does the Epicurean confront the temporal "distention" of human consciousness? Let us consider first how the Epicurean deals with the future. Epicurus claimed that one should not feel anxious about future difficulties (mellesmos) but should focus on the pleasures at hand. The future does not exist, and should therefore not produce pain. As Epicurus says in the Letter to Menoeceus, "he speaks idly</page><page sequence="21">Andrea Nightingale 81 who says that he fears death, not because it will be painful when present but because it is painful in anticipation (lupei mell?n). For if something causes no distress when present, it is fruitless to be pained by the expectation (prosdok?menon) of it" (124-25). One should not "spoil the present" by fears of future pains; nor should one hope for pleasures that are "not at hand" (Vatican Sayings 35). At the same time, one should not simply ignore the past and future. On the contrary, one should think of the future with confidence and hope, expecting the continuation of one's present pleasures: "the comfortable state of the flesh, and the confident expectation of this (to peri taut?s piston elpisma), contain the highest and most secure joy for those who are capable of reasoning."25 One should "hope for" and "expect" ongoing comfort and, indeed, tranquillity. Friend? ship, in particular, offers one exceptional confidence in abid? ing pleasures: "Men enjoy the pleasures of friendship not only in the present, but are excited by the hope of the near and distant future" (spe eriguntur consequents ac poster i temporis). Without friendship, "we can never secure a firm and perpetual joy in life" (firmam et perpetuam iucunditatem vitae). In short, "the mind is strengthened by friendship, and cannot be severed from the hope (spe) of experiencing future pleasures" (Cicero, De finibus i.66-6j). In dealing with the future, then, the Epicurean must nourish confident hopes of ongoing tranquillity up to the time of death. Let us look, now, at the past. Just as one must have confi? dent expectations of the future, one must have grateful memories of the past. Memory, in fact, plays a crucial role in dealing with pains experienced in the present. According to Epicurus, when one is in physical pain, one must remember that acute pains pass quickly and that chronic illnesses can be outweighed by pleasurable feelings (Principle Doctrines 3-4). The key to pain-management, in fact, is the act of re? membering past pleasures and using them to combat pain. "The wise man's mind does not let past pleasures flow away" but "retains" these pleasures, while letting go of past</page><page sequence="22">82 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY and present pains.26 Epicurus famously enacted this doctrine on his deathbed. As he said in a letter to his friend Idomeneus written when he was on the verge of death: I write this to you on this blessed and last day of my life. Strangury and dysentery has taken hold of me, with an intensity in its magni? tude that does not abate. But the joy in my soul (to kata psych?n chair on) at the memory (mn?m?i) of our past discussions is enough to counterbalance this. (D.L. 10.22) Memory of past pleasures "counterbalances" present pains. As Cicero's Epicurean Torquatus claims: Just as we are elated by the anticipation of good things, so we are delighted by their recollection. Fools are tormented by the memory of former evils; wise men have the delight of renewing in grateful remembrance the blessings of the past (bona praeterita grata recor datione renovata d?lectant). We have the power both to obliterate our misfortunes in an almost perpetual forgetfulness and to re? member favorable things joyfully and with pleasure (adversa quasi perpetua oblivione obruamus et secunda iucunde ac suaviter mem inerimus). (De finibus 1.57) The art of memory?and of forgetting?is a crucial element in the production of ongoing pleasures. Plutarch makes a similar point when he says that the Epicurean sets out to "remember clearly and hold on to the images and the feel? ings and the motions of [past] pleasures. "27 As scholars have noted, Epicurus had a rather strange theory of memory?he believed that memories are not stored in the mind but take the form of external images of past events that strike the mind from without.28 The mind, nonetheless, has an active role in selecting the correct images of the past: the Epicurean should gratefully remember the good things at all times, and especially when experiencing physical pain. Memories of the past, then, play a crucial role in dealing with the present. In Epicurean philosophy, memory looks back with gratefulness for past pleasures. Lucretius places great emphasis on gratitude, which is a central Epicurean</page><page sequence="23">Andrea Nightingale 83 virtue. In his arguments against the fear of death, Lucretius tells the readers to be grateful for the pleasures they have ex? perienced and not to wish in vain for endless pleasures. If your former life, now gone by, was gratifying (grata) to you; and if all the good things [of your life] have not been poured into a leaky jar . . . and have not flowed through or perished without giv? ing you gratification (ingrata), why not?like a banqueter fed full with life?retire and grasp secure peace with a calm mind?2? (3-935-39) For the Epicurean, the memory of the past should produce grateful pleasure, not a painful nostalgia for "the good old days." The virtue of gratitude allows one to be satisfied with the present, and to avoid anxious desires for future things that are not at hand. The lack of gratitude, by contrast, gen? erates dissatisfaction and anxiety: "because you are always desiring what is absent, you scorn the present: your life?in? complete and ungratifying (imperfecta . . . ingrata)?slips by. Death stands at your head unexpected, before you can de? part satisfied and filled-up." (3.957-60) Ingratitude?the "ungrateful mind"?is a vice and an affliction: To always go on feeding the ungrateful nature of the mind (animi ingratam naturam) and never to fill it with good things and be sat? isfied?as the seasons of the year do for us, when they come round bringing their new growth and their various delights, yet we are never filled with the fruits of life?this, I think, is what people have memorialized in the story of the girls in the flower of life who poured liquid into a leaky vessel that could never be filled. (3. 1003-10) Nature offers varied pleasures and delight, but it also brings the passing of time, setting boundaries to the human life. One should enjoy past and present pleasures, but accept that these are finite (because humans are finite). To understand Epicurus' treatment of temporal vicissi? tudes, we must examine his theory of pleasure. Epicurus ar? gued that "static pleasure" (katast?matik? h?don?)?the</page><page sequence="24">84 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY complete absence of pain, desire, and anxiety?is the highest mode of happiness. Once one achieves static pleasure, one does not need more pleasure: the individual who achieves and maintains static pleasure lives a life that is, at that time, "complete" (Principle Doctrines 19-21). "Kinetic pleasures"? those that fulfil temporary and transient desires?do not add to or increase static pleasure, but give it a "varied" texture. "When pain has been completely removed, pleasure is subject to variation but not to increase" (Cicero, De fin. 2.9-10). Note that one can experience ataraxia even in the presence of physical pain: as we have seen, the mind can control bodily pain (via memories of past pleasures) and remain tranquil, grateful, and secure. One can, then, enjoy the "varied" gifts and fruits of the ongoing seasons?and also the afflictions of the body?without desiring anything more than what is at hand. While kinetic pleasures come and go, one can enjoy tranquillity throughout one's entire life. As Annas rightly ob? serves, "Our final end is not a state made up of bodily pleas? ures; nor is it a state in which bodily pleasures are replaced by mental ones. Rather, we aim at being in a condition in which bodily and mental pleasures of satisfying our needs re? sult in a state of satisfaction which is not disturbed by the in? cursions of further needs and pains."3? Is static pleasure primarily located in bodily experiences, or is it generated rather by mental activities? Nussbaum ar? gues that Epicurus "finds truth in the body": "katastematic pleasure of the soul [does not] include elaborate philoso? phizing, or indeed, much more than the happy memory and awareness of bodily health."i1 In her view, the mind focuses exclusively on the body: it has a narrow and curiously pas? sive role in the pursuit and maintenance of pleasure. As I will argue, the mind has a much more active role in the at? tainment and maintenance of a "complete" and happy life. In particular, the mind creates a narrative of past, present, and future events?a life-narrative?that allows for the maintenance of tranquillity in the midst of the vicissitudes of life. The mind is not a passive agent that is simply "aware"</page><page sequence="25">Andrea Nightingale 85 of bodily health and pleasure. Rather, the rational mind gen? erates a life of serenity that is "complete" at all times.32 We may ask how a human being riddled with bodily af? flictions, pains, and losses can live a "complete" and fully tranquil life. What does it mean to experience ongoing hap? piness that doesn't increase or change, but is maintained in the presence of "varied" pleasures and multiple bodily pains? Nussbaum attacks Epicurus for desiring a life without change and for exhibiting an "intolerance for nature and temporality."33 I disagree: Epicurus has a profound sense of change and temporality, and deals directly with both issues. By cultivating gratitude (via happy memories of the past) and confident expectation of a pleasurable future (as well as of a painless death), the Epicurean exercises very careful "time-management." As I argue, he actively distends his mind into the past and the future?a mind "fortified" by grateful memories and confident hopes: The body rejoices just so long as it perceives a present pleasure; but the mind perceives both the present pleasure, along with the body, and foresees the one that is coming without allowing the past pleas? ure to flow away (prospicere venientem nee praeteritam praeter fluere sinere). Hence there will always (semper) be perpetual, tightly-knit pleasures (perpetuas et contextas voluptates) in the wise man, since the anticipation of pleasures hoped for is linked with the recollection of those things experienced (cum expectatio speratarum voluptatum cum perceptarum memoria iungeretur). (Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 5.95) This passage clearly articulates the way that the Epicurean maintains a state of tranquillity and pleasure throughout time. Contrary to Nussbaum's claims, the Epicureans use their minds to celebrate and feel grateful for "nature and temporality." They cultivate a mental "fortress" that enables them to enjoy natural changes while confronting pain and death with a serene mind. Epicurus believed that one can enjoy ongoing pleasures at all times, thus achieving a "complete" and "perpetually"</page><page sequence="26">86 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY tranquil life. The Epicurean stores up past pleasures, enjoys present pleasures, and expects future pleasures: he or she ex? periences "perpetual" pleasures that are "knitted together" (contextas) out of multiple temporalities. One might say that the Epicurean "knits together" the pleasures of the past, present, and (expected) future into a unified narrative. The pleasurable life, then, does not simply consist in an aware? ness of bodily health and the absence of pain. It should not be identified merely with the pleasure deriving from the ab? sence of all pain (which, after all, is not sustainable) but rather the ongoing experience of pleasure in the midst of pains and desires. It is the mind that maintains pleasures (static and kinetic) by prudently fulfilling natural desires and controlling inevitable pains with a "knitted together" narra? tive of pleasure.34 The mind, then, does a great deal of spade work: the cul? tivation ("gardening") of a life of pleasure and tranquillity. It does this, I argue, by a vigilant act of attention?attention to the past, present, and future. How does Lucretius con? ceive of "attention"? I want to look again at Augustine, whose concept of "attention" (attentio) deals directly with the mind's ability to create a narrative that knits together one's past, present, and future into a singular, satisfying whole. In Augustine, attentio is an active faculty that oper? ates by focusing on a discourse, an action, or a biographical and/or historical period (for example, a psalm, a single event, a life-narrative, or a historical narrative).3s Past, pres? ent, and future can be held together by the act of attention? attentio can arrange the pieces of one's life into a cohesive narrative. Attentio, in short, is the rational control of the (in? evitable) distention of the mind into the past, present, and future. It is not simply the passive act of "paying attention" but rather the active assemblage of specific memories, pres? ent experiences, and future expectations. As Riceour has ob? served, attentio has both a passive and an active role in Augustine's theory.36 Attentio focuses on some things, and not others: it selects a particular set of values and assembles</page><page sequence="27">Andrea Nightingale 87 a particular life-narrative. Attentio sees what it wants to see and uses what it wants to use, while rejecting unpleasant or vicious alternatives. Augustine's creation of his own autobi? ographical narrative?with the specific form of a Christian conversion story?is generated by his attentio. Augustine at? tends to his life from a specific vantage point, adopting a life narrative that serves to knit the past, present, and future (in? cluding the afterlife) into a cohesive whole. Let us turn back to Lucretius. Consider the following pas? sage on the mind's attention to temporal events: In one moment of time (tempore in uno) when we are perceiving things (for example, when one word is being sent forth), many times are lurking (t?mpora multa latent). Reason knows that these [multiple times] are there. Hence it happens that in any given mo? ment (quovis in tempore) various images are ready at hand in every place: so great is their mobility and so great the store of things. . . . And because the images are thin, the mind cannot perceive them acutely except by straining its attention (contenait); therefore all other things that are present perish, except those for which the mind has prepared itself (ipse paravit). It prepares itself, moreover, and hopes to see the future event (ipse parat sese porro speratque futurum) that follows each thing. (4.794-806) This strange passage conceives of time in terms of the ongo? ing presence of a great store of images that, in some sense, contain the past and the future. Lucretius is not suggesting that different times "exist" at the same time; on the con? trary, "time does not exist in itself."37 Rather, the presence of multiple images of different "times" is perceived by the mental attention to these images. The mind thus experiences different "times" in the present. This, I believe, resembles Augustine's theory of the "distention" of the mind into the past and the future, though in Lucretius the mind perceives images of different experiences of time in the external world rather than in the interior "space" of the psyche. In order to perceive specific events and life experiences, the mind must "prepare itself." It must engage in an act of</page><page sequence="28">88 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY attention?attending to specific events in the past and the present. Consider Epicurus' conception of attention?epi? bol?. Due to the paucity of extant fragments, different schol? ars have offered different accounts of epibol?. Some argue that epibol? is a passive process by which the mind grasps anything at all (Furley); others argue that it involves the ac? tive straining of the mind. As Asmis, following Bailey, puts it: epibol? is "a special act of attention that, in the case of perceptions, results in presentations that are not only sharp but also 'near' and for this reason faithful to the object; in the case of thought, it results in clear and truthful mental im? ages.'^8 The Epicurean Philodemus adds a crucial piece of information about epibol?: we should make the "most in? tense application (epibol?) to past, present, and future goods" (De dis 3 coll. 39.8-11). This suggests that one should actively pay attention to good things: epibol? in? volves an act of attention that collects together good memo? ries and expectations to create a successful Epicurean narrative. Philodemus makes a similar point at the very end of On Death: For people of stable mind?even if through some unavoidable cause they were unsuspecting in advance of the fact that already the para? graph and limit of their life was approaching-when death comes into actual view, they sum up in one period systematically, and with keenest vision . . . their own complete enjoyment of life and the ut? ter unconsciousness that is to come over them, breathe their last as calmly as if they had never put aside their act of attention (epibol?) for an instant of time.39 I am not so much interested in the question of Epicurean epistemology: rather, I want to focus on the use of attention to create a narrative of pleasure. Cicero sums this up in a passage on the Epicurean sage: [The sage] enjoys perpetual pleasure (semper est in voluptate), since there is no moment when he does not have more pleasures than pains; since he remembers the past with gratitude, he masters the</page><page sequence="29">Andrea Nightingale 89 present (praesentibus ... potitur) in such a way that he attends (an imadvertat) to how many pleasures there are, and he does not rely on the future; he looks forward to it, but enjoys what is present (exspectat ilia, fruitur praesentibus). (De finibus 1.62) Here, the sage takes control of the present by "attending" to pleasures, both past and present. The sage also expects good things in the future?he attends to this as well. This ac? tivity of the mind is crucial for the cultivation of "perpetual" pleasure. The Epicurean must practice the mental activity of "calling the soul away from reflection upon troubles and in recalling it to the consideration of pleasures" (avocatione a cogitanda molestia et revocatione ad contemplandas volup tates). It is "reason" that "forbids one from attending to troubles" (vetat igitur ratio intueri molestias). As Cicero sums it up, reason blunts [the soul's] keeness to dwell upon wretchedness and, sound? ing a retreat from such thoughts, eagerly urges it on again to descry a variety of pleasures and engage in them with all the powers of the mind (incit?t ad conspiciendas totaque mente contrectandas varias voluptates) . . . the wise man's life is packed (referta) with the rec? ollection of past and the prospect of future pleasures (praeteritarum memoria et spe consequentium sapientis vitam refertam).40 Here, the individual pays attention "with the whole mind" to good things and occludes (forgets) the bad ones. It thus creates a narrative of a life that is "packed" or (to use the image from above) "knitted together" with continuous pleasures. Clearly, it is mental attention that creates the nar? rative. As Porter suggests, "the redescription of pain as pain? less or indifferent, achieved pragmatically through intense mental focusing, disposes us to all the Epicurean virtues."41 Porter stops short of suggesting that pleasure is ultimately experienced and, indeed, created by the mind: the focus, he says, is primarily on the physical senses.42 To be sure, Epicu? rus claims that mental pleasures arise from the connection with the body. But, as we have seen, the mind can counteract bodily pain by the active attention to former pleasures and by</page><page sequence="30">90 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY a confident expectation of future pleasures. This does not mean that the Epicurean ignores the present, dwelling in the past or the future: on the contrary, he or she focuses on the past and present to deal with the possibility of pleasure in the present. Since the mind is naturally extended into the past and the future, it creates a "knitted together" narrative that en? ables the Epicurean to experience "perpetual pleasure." In? deed, one could argue that the Epicurean "dwells" primarily in the mental fortress of a philosophic narrative: he or she finds a "fortified" shelter in the mental act of attention and the creation of a narrative of pleasure. As Annas has argued, for the Epicureans, happiness is "radically internalized": "[happiness] depends on what one does?one cannot achieve it by engaging in any old course of action?but happiness it? self is not consituted by one's activities, but by what could be called one's attitude or point of view on those activities."43 This attitude is a disposition of the mind and soul: a conscious sense of happiness at all times and in all circumstances. Of course the mind encounters the body at all points?it listens to the body and attends to the natural world (indeed the mind itself is a bodily entity). The Epicurean, then, must attend to the pleasures offered by nature and to his or her own bodily and mental pleasures. In addition, he or she must use the mind to create a narrative that shapes this kind of attention. Only in this way can one find "shelter from the storm." What sort of narrative, then, does the Epicurean create? It is certainly an unusual sort of narrative. Like all narratives, it connects the past, present, and future into a single "story." But most narratives focus on changes, and are fueled by the desire for greater happiness in the future. The Platonic or Christian narrative, for example, is rooted in eros and de? sire: desire for what one does not yet fully possess. Even af? ter a conversion?which gives life an important shape?the Platonist or Christian dwells in a narrative of metaphysical longing. Epicurus' narrative takes a different form. It deals with variations on a single theme: the maintenance of ataraxia and perpetual pleasure. It deals with an entire life,</page><page sequence="31">Andrea Nightingale 91 but has little or no plot. The absence of plot, I argue, is due to the absence (via the mental removal) of unnecessary de? sires. As Porter rightly observes, "when ataraxy is achieved, pleasure is no longer an object of desire"; "to be in a state of ataraxy ... is not to desire anything at all."44 The Epicurean narrative, in short, is characterized by the absence of desire; it is constructed by the continuous attention to pleasures "knitted together" into a single whole. Unpleasant thoughts are actively?attentively?"forgotten" and thus left out of the narrative. The narrative therefore has no ups or downs: it moves in a more or less straight line, from beginning to end. It has no future goal to strive towards. The goal has been achieved: Epicurus has discovered everything there is to know, so there is no need to search any further. If one prac? tices Epicureanism correctly, desires can always be satisfied, and life is continually enjoyed. This philosophy is anti-erotic (in Plato's sense), since wisdom and pleasure are fully achieved at all times, and nothing more is wanted. 6. HUMUS AND HUMANUS i want to return, now, to the existential experience of "night-vision," that is, the experience of "seeing" the infinity of atoms swirling in an opaque, boundless void. Let us recall Lucretius' description of his own experience of this vision: The walls of the world part asunder, and I see things going on throughout the whole void . . . the earth does not obstruct the view of all things being seen (omnia dispiciantur), whatever is going on below in the void under my feet. From these things a certain divine pleasure and dread/awe (quaedam divina voluptas . . . atque hor? ror) seizes me because, by your power, nature has become so man? ifest, exposed, and uncovered in every part (natura . . . tarn manifesta patens ex omni parte retecta est). (3.16-30) As we have seen, Epicurean philosophy "illuminates" this dark region; the atomic universe thus discovered serves as the basis of a new form of ethical life. Lucretius' admission</page><page sequence="32">92 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY that he feels horror as well as pleasure reminds us of the sense of vertigo and fear one experiences at the vision of a swarm of invisible entities that produce all things but do not include humans or animate beings. As some scholars have suggested, this passage conjures up a "sublime" reaction to the immensity of the spectacle. Conte and Porter, for exam? ple, claim that the depiction of the contrary feelings of pleas? ure and fear are echoed in Kant's theory of the sublime.45 Certainly the immensity of the spectacle of the atomic uni? verse nicely anticipates Kant's conception of the encounter with immense or infinite magnitudes. The similarities be? tween Lucretius' discourse and that of Kant are quite strik? ing but, as I will argue, the two philosophers radically diverge. Ultimately, Lucretius leads us to the anti-sublime. Conte, in "Instructions for a Sublime Reader," makes much of Lucretius' celebration of the power of the mind. Lucretius, he argues, aims to instill the sense of sublimity in the readers? the sense that the human mind is (almost) as big as the uni? verse. As Conte argues, the achievement of Epicurean wisdom "inevitably produces a sense of exaltation on the part of the in? dividual, who becomes conscious of his own intellectual great? ness.'^6 He points, in particular, to the following passage: Since the sum of space is infinite abroad beyond the walls of the world, the mind seeks to understand what there is in the distance where reason continually desires to look forth (prospicere usque velit mens), and where the mind's free projection itself flies (animi iactus liber quo pervolet ipse). (2.1044-47) This description of the mind?its ability to freely wander? allows the human being to "see" invisible and obscure things, and to achieve theoretical understanding.47 We must remember, however, that Epicureans not only grasp the ob? jective "truth" of the world but also understand their own place in this world?their inevitable collapse into the atomic abyss at the time of death. The mind sees (among other things) the minuteness of human beings in the infinite span of time and space.</page><page sequence="33">Andrea Nightingale 93 As I would argue, the mind is, in some crucial sense, hum? bled rather than exalted: it sees the human as a part of hu? mus. To be sure, Epicurus' discovery of truth is a rare and spectacular intellectual achievement. To his devotees, Epicu? rus is a near-divine figure. But this exaltation of a great hu? man being is but one tiny event in the greater scheme of things. As Lucretius puts it in a powerful passage: You must look wide and deep, and see every part in the far dis? tance, so that you may remember that the sum of things is unfath? omable, and that you may see how small a part of the whole universe?how infinitely small?is one single heaven; this part is not so large as a single man on the entire earth. If you should keep this proposition well in view, and see it clearly, you would cease to wonder at many things. (6.647-54) Here, Lucretius invites his readers to stop wondering at the world?since it is scientifically understood?but he also tells them how minute they are in the boundless universe. If an entire heaven is "infinitely small" in the larger cosmos, then how much smaller and more minute are human beings. We vividly see the minute proportions?and unimportance?of the human in the greater scheme of the cosmos. Let us compare this, briefly, to Kant's conception of the mind and its role in the experience of the sublime. For Kant, reason partakes in a noumenal realm outside of the physical world of matter-in-motion: "if the human mind is to be able even to think the given infinite without contradiction, it must have within itself a power that is supersensible."48 A human being encountering an immense magnitude experi? ences the sublime, which initially takes the form of "a rapid alteration of repulsion and attraction to one and the same object."49 This person experiences a shocked surprise (Ver? wunderung), an astonishment that borders on fear: his or her imagination cannot take in the whole. But reason then steps in?taking over for the imagination; in an act of "self respect," the person comes to experience a tranquil admira? tion (Bewunderung) for the immense magnitude in the</page><page sequence="34">94 NIGHT-VISION: EPICUREAN ESCHATOLOGY natural world. Tranquil, because the mind's own superiority is not in question. As Kant puts it, In the power of reason, there is a different and nonsensible stan? dard that has this infinity under itself as a unit; and since in con? trast to this standard everything in nature is small, we find in our mind a superiority over nature itself in its immensity. In the same way, though the irresistability of nature's might makes us, consid? ered as natural beings, recognize our physical impotence, it reveals in us at the same time an ability to judge ourselves independent of nature, and reveals in us a superiority over nature. . . . This keeps the humanity in our person from being degraded. 5? Kant is well aware that immense natural magnitudes can dwarf the human being and make one feel "impotent," but his conception of reason allows for the pleasure of human superiority to nature. At the core of Kant's conception of the sublime is the anthropocentric belief in the superiority of hu? mans to all natural beings. When one turns back to Lucretius, one immediately notes that the mind does not have this special ontological status. On the contrary, the mind is material, made up of atoms and void. It is in no way separate from or superior to nature. To be sure, Lucretius does not believe that the vision of the infi? nite universe should "degrade" humans or make them feel impotent. Rather, the vision makes us feel very, very small. 51 In Epicurean theory, there is an inextricable connection be? tween humanus and humus. This theory is nonanthropocen tric and, one might argue, far more ecological than the human-centered views of modernity. Epicurus conceives of humans as earthly animals?animals that have the freedom to think and act, and to create meaning. Humans are not ex? alted beings, and cannot feel "sublime" pleasure in the Kant? ian sense. We dwell not in the fantasy of human superiority to nature, but in the reality of a nature the gives us life and death. "The parent of all is seen herself as the universal tomb of things" (esse videtur omniparens eadem rerum com? mune sepulchrum, 5.259). Our dwelling-place, then, is de</page><page sequence="35">Andrea Nightingale 95 termined by nature: but our mode of dwelling is our own choice. If one accepts the reality of nature's limits, and does not indulge in unlimited or transcendental desires, one can live a pleasurable life. The Epicurean does this by creating mental "fortifications." An unfortified mind is vulnerable to pain, anxiety, and unhappiness. Dwelling on earth is not easy?there is no physical (or metaphysical) shelter from the storm. Except, of course, in one's mental attitude towards one's life?in ongoing attention to the pleasures of the past, present, and/or future. This mental attitude is articulated, fi? nally, in a narrative of pleasure. As I have argued, only by cultivating night-vision can a person develop the understanding, attention, and prudence that is the basis of the Epicurean life. By "seeing" the dark atomic world?which contains a person's life and death? one can discover one's own limits and find a way to lead a happy life. The night-vision of the Epicurean is an antipla tonic form of illumination: one discovers the truth by jour? neying into the dark. This is what keeps Lucretius awake at night, viewing the dark universe of atoms and bringing that obscure realm into lucid and enlightening poetic language.
