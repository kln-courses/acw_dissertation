Genova: Casa Editrice Marietti, 1991; cm 24,5 X 17,5, pp. 256. L. 60.000. ISBN 88-211-8041-7. This is the first OT volume in the new Italian series of criticai commentaries on both Testaments. Published in 1991 (though the review copy reached Gregorianum only in early</page><page sequence="2">760 GREGORIANUM, VOL. 75 (1994) FASC. IV: RECENSIONES 1994), Spreafico's work is an excellent start for the series, which fills a long-felt need for Italian studente of the Bible. Shortly afterwards, the first part of J.A. Soggin's commentary on Genesis (on chapters 1-11) also appeared in the same series (1991). As the title of the series indicates, this is a full-scale historical and exegetical commentary, and is one of the most extensive Zephaniah commentaries available in any language at present. As chance would have it, it appeared in the same year as the substantial work of Ehud Ben Zvi, A Historical-Critical Study ofthe Book of Zephaniah (BZAW198; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1991), and the shorter commentary of Klaus Seybold, Nahum, Habakuk, Zephanja (Ziircher Bibelkommentare, AT 24,2; ZÃ¬irich: Theologischer Verlag, 1991); no dialogue with these two works was possible of course, though Seybold's earlier studies on Zephaniah are noted by Spreafico. The work begins with a detailed General Introduction (pp. 7-67), which deals with ali the usuai introductory questions. One of the most interesting sections here examines the literary structuration of the book (pp. 30-57); criteria for distinguishing the literary units are discussed, and the section concludes with a structured transliteration of the complete Hebrew text. In questions of literary history, Spreafico stands with those scholars who have concluded that the book received its essential form already in pre-exilic times, as opposed to those who have seen it as an exilic or post-exilic composition. Most of the material, Spreafico holds, can be attributed to Zephaniah, who lived in the time of Josiah (as the superscription indicates). Three stages of redaction are identified: (1) the first redaction took place shortly after the activity of Zephaniah, in the pre-exilic period: the prophet's oracles were collected and put together with only minimal additions, such as the names (at least) in 1,1; and some formulas such as 2,5ba, together, perhaps, with the occurrences of n'm yhwh (1,2.3.10; 3,8), and 2,10: (2) in the second half of the 5th century, or slightly later, further small additions were made (l,laa.b; 2,7aa.bp.ll; 3.10.18-20), mainly with the intention of interpreting the earlier material according to the categories of exilic and early postexilic "exodus-theology"; (3) finally a number of small additions (I,3ap.8aa.9aoi.l0aa.l2aa.l7ap) were inserted in the Hellenistic period, probably in the first part of the 3rd cent. The commentary proper is divided into three parts, according to the structure prop osed by Spreafico: 1,1-2,3; 2,4-3,5; 3,6-20. The commentary on each sub-unit within the three parts begins with a special bibliography, offers a translation of the unit followed by detailed philological notes, and then presents an exegetical comment on the verses in ques tion where one notes a Constant dialogue with the work of other scholars. Several themes are treated separately in an excursus: thus the Day of the Lord (pp. 98-105); the expression "daughter Zion/Jerusalem" (pp. 191-94); the use of the terms "Judah" and "Israel" in Zephaniah (pp. 195-96). A concluding section sums up the main themes of Zephaniah's message (pp. 205-10). At the end of the book there is an extensive bibliography (pp. 213-33), to which one must add the list of Zephaniah commentaries given on pp. 11-15, and complete indexes of biblical texts and proper names (it is a little surprising here to find that biblical personages and localities are put in the same index as later commentators). A few details with regard to the bibliography: one can note that I.J. Ball's dissertation, listed on p. 214, has now been published as Zephania: A Rhetorical Study (Berkeley, CA: Bibal Press, 1988); similarly the Freiburg dissertation of R. Edler (1983), listed on p. 218, was published as Dos Kerygma des Propheten Zefanja (Freiburger Theologische Studien 126; Freiburg: Herder, 1984); J. Barr's article "Theophany and Anthropomorphism..." was published in VTSup 7, I960 (contrast p. 214). Various other small errors and misprints in the bibliography and indexes will hopefully be corrected in future reprints of the work. It would also be helpful to add a full list of the abbreviations used for periodicals and series. Ali in ali, then, a most useful commentary, with originai literary research and careful philological analysis. It augurs well for the new series to which it belongs, and will certainly take its place among the standard Zephaniah commentaries which every scholar interested in that book will want to study.
