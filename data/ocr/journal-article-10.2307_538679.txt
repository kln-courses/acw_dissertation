<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTE Toward a Definition of Folk Drama* Even the most cursory survey of contemporary scholarship in the social sciences reveals a regular, if not systematic, use of theatrical metaphor in the analysis of human behavior. Victor Turner, for example, describes ritual in terms of plot and theme.' Transferring the metaphor from staged enactments to less stylized conduct, Philip A. Dennis depicts the Oaxacan village drunk as a conventional character in the drama of community life.2 Similarly, Thomas Gregor characterizes the social interactions of the Mehinaku of Brazil as improvisational drama.3 In studies integrating various disciplines in the social sciences, Erving Goffman is undoubtedly the most influential advocate of the dramatic model. Manifest within this dialogue are two approaches which may be termed life as theater and life is theater. Occasionally, the difference between these two models is so subtle that it almost vanishes. The two theoretical orientations are distinct, however, and only the latter in its more extreme forms should be censured. The most useful survey of the former approach has been at- tempted by Elizabeth Burns who remarks that "behavior is not. . .theatrical because it is of a certain kind but because the observer recognises certain patterns and sequences which are analogous to those with which he is familiar in the theatre."4 Burns's statement clearly characterizes the perspective taken in her own studies and in the works of other analysts (most notably Erving Goffman and Kenneth Burke) who have adopted drama as a paradigm for discussing social interaction. In these studies the usage is metaphorical; theatrical terms are utilized in order to describe behavior in critically meaningful terms. The differences between drama and social life remain unobscured. The proponents of the second approach have frequently strayed from sound methodology by ignoring the fact that the relationship between life and theater is analogical; in Erving Goff- man's words, it is a "mere analogy."5 This analogy, unfortunately, has been interpreted * An earlier version of this essay was presented at the 1977 meetings of the American Folklore Society in Detroit, Michigan. I am grateful to Roger D. Abrahams for illuminating the distinction between the approaches I have labeled "life as theater" and "life is theater." 1 The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure (Chicago: Aldine, 1969), pp. 50 and 92. 2 "The Role of the Drunk in a Oaxacan Village," American Anthropologist, 77 (1975), 856-863. 3 Mehinaku: The Drama of Daily Life in a Brazilian Indian Village (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977). 4 Theatricality: A Study of Convention in the Theatre and in Social Life (London: Longman Group Ltd., 1972), p. 12. s Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (Garden City, New York: Anchor, 1959), p. 254.</page><page sequence="2">844 NOTE literally, resulting in arguments that life is theater. Within such a framework, virtually all behavior is susceptible to being designated "drama." A less extreme, but still unsound, line of reasoning operates homologically. In general, this argument maintains that forms such as ritual, festival, pageant, or even baseball6 which utilize the means of dramatic art (costuming, distinct playing areas, "scripting," and the like) should be categorized as folk drama. It is possible, perhaps, to understand why the social scientist has been vulnerable to over- reading dramatic qualities into phenomena in which dramatic performance is not an organizing principle. Operating as he does at the interstices of his own culture and those of his infor- mants, the fieldworker becomes acutely aware of alien structural principles which lend an aura of theatricality to even the most mundane interactions. Burns makes the point quite well: "The theatrical quality of life, taken for granted by nearly everyone, seems to be experienced most concretely by those who feel themselves on the margin of events either because they have adopted the role of spectator or because, though present, they have not yet been offered a part or have not learnt it sufficiently well to enable them to join the actors."7 It is impossible to deny the propriety of the application of the theatrical metaphor to many interactions. The notion of life as a stage has been recognized widely at least since Shakespeare. In some instances, however, the dramatic metaphor has been too vigorously embraced, and this has resulted in crushing the original sense out of the term "drama." Such zealous adop- tion of the metaphor is especially to be condemned by folklorists when it results in the unwar- ranted extension of the scope of the genre "folk drama" to include those activities that, while including a sense of staging, cannot be considered drama per se. If we do not attempt to ar- bitrate definitions crucial to our discipline, scholars lacking our concerns will. To this point most discussions of folk drama have been couched within larger arguments. Scholars most often have defined the genre in relation to their own theoretical concerns rang- ing from the myth-ritual debate to symbolic anthropology. While this is accepted practice and has contributed, moreover, to our fund of knowledge in the area, a definition unhampered by more comprehensive speculations would facilitate precise dialogue, both within the discipline of folklore and in related fields. The following remarks, then, represent a preliminary attempt to construct a framework within which folk drama can be reasonably and precisely discussed, bearing in mind that any reasonable definition of folk drama must incorporate the following characteristics: freedom from theoretical bias, applicability across broad cultural areas, and ap- propriate use of pivotal terms (such as, "folk," "drama," and "role"). The first issue, and perhaps the most problematic, in any proposed definition is the assign- ment of individual examples of dramatic art to the folk milieu. Not only is this an area of ongoing debate within the discipline, but as Roger Abrahams notes, "most texts that we have collected are demonstrably close to literate sources."'8 It would be foolish to attempt to resolve a problem of this sort in a brief discussion; on the other hand, it is possible to indicate some inappropriate usages that occur in the literature. In some cases the term folk has been equated with "quaint" or "folksy." Plays have been labeled as folk drama simply because an author endeavors to infuse his work with a regional or 6 See Dennis Porter, "The Perilous Quest: Baseball as Folk Drama," Critical Inquiry, 4 (1977), 143-158. 7 Theatricality, p. 11. 8 Roger D.

The works of American playwright Percy MacKaye,9 therefore, have been assigned to the folk category although they are not subject to the conventional alterations generally imposed by traditional means of transmission and performance. In spite of regional tone, these and similar works must be con- sidered belletristic or sophisticated. Popular theatrical genres such as Indonesian ludruk and the therukoothu of India are closer to true folk drama and, apparently, have been derived from folk forms. But owing to the profes- sional status of the dramatic ensembles that perform the plays and to the heterogeneity of the audiences, these forms cannot actually be considered folk either. We seem to have the ability to designate discrete pieces as being either folk, popular, or sophisticated. Nevertheless, the mutual influences prevailing in most cultures create important exceptions to generalizations involving the folk/nonfolk dichotomy in dramatic art. This is especially true if we attempt to base our criteria on textual provenience, rather than on live renderings of a "script." The argument for folklore as performance, so vigorously supported by many contemporary folklorists, is particularly applicable to the present discussion; for ultimately any speculations on the folk quality of an example of drama must examine the man- ner in which received materials are modified in form and function by specific traditional perfor- mance contexts.10 Given this premise, it is necessary to consider, along with Bogatyrev, "as 'folk' plays even those plays that originated from the artistic dramas, whether religious or secular, and, once having reached the village, became popular, were substantially changed and made proximate in their form to other folk plays."" Assuming the ability to ascertain the folk quality of a performance, what criteria exist for separating drama per se from other types of traditional performance? The term "drama" is no less problematic than the term "folk" and is perhaps even more susceptible to misapplication. While there have been efforts to define folk drama, these efforts have been bound to other theoretical considerations. We can see this tendency in two of the best recent efforts to explain folk drama: Alan Brody's notion of folk drama as "explained action"12 connected to ritual survivals and Roger Abrahams' characterization of folk drama as "traditional play activity that relies primarily on dialogue to establish its meaning and that tells a story through the combina- tion of dialogue and action, the outcome of which is known to the audience ahead of time.''13 Brody therefore advances an evolutionary argument, while Abrahams' basic thrust is the ex- ploration of ludic activity in general. Despite the importance of these two works, they both in- tertwine folk drama with larger questions. For this reason, a more focused definition should complement these and similar studies. 9 See, for example, Kentucky Mountain Fantasies (New York: Longmans, Green and Co., 1928). 10 The argument that the folk draw from many domains for materials and rework them according to the dictates of a traditional aesthetic is familiar to folklorists. One of the better explications of this process is Henry Glassie's discussion of the "traditional filter" in his essay entitled "Folk Art," in Folklore and Folklife: An Introduction, ed. Richard M. Dorson (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1972), pp. 253-280. 1 Petr Bogatyrev, "Forms and Functions of Folk Theater," in Semiotics of Art, eds. Ladislav Matejka and Irwin R.

The proposed definition is not in- compatible with existing scholarship in the area, and, more importantly, it discourages the distortion of the concept of drama increasingly noted in the social scientific literature. An ex- planation of the individual components of the proposed definition is required. Performance in the present sense is intended to designate more than mere role-playing. Per- formance specifies the self-conscious staging of activity before a "passive" group (an audience), although audiences at folk performances are rarely truly inactive. The present no- tion, then, proceeds from Hymes' concept of performance as an occasion "when one or more persons assumes responsibility for presentation."14 This characterization excludes the "presen- tation of self in everyday life," the dramatic metaphor of sociology, and most of the ritual enactments discussed as dramas in the anthropological literature. The former are eliminated by virtue of the fact that while we may understand the operation of specialized "fronts" or fa- cades"5 as resembling the character one assumes on stage (and even name them like stock characters in drama: flirt, he-man, snob, jock, and so on), it is preeminently clear that such roles are not constructed for entertainment. The converse, in fact, is true; the individual engaged in "wearing a face" tries at all costs to avoid the accusations of insincerity and ar- tificiality that would follow the discovery of his lack of openness and reluctance to "be himself." Ritual enactments are equally unfit to be termed performances, in spite of some important similarities to drama noted by Abrahams,16 because all present are required to participate in one form or another. As a general rule, ritual is prosecuted with the aid of masks, costumes, separate spatial domains, and stylized vocal and motor behaviors. In short, the very stuff of which drama in all times and places is composed is found in our rituals. Not infrequently there is even the building tension, climax, and denouement associated with drama. The confusion between ritual and drama that we may feel on examining ceremony does not appear to exist in the minds of participants, however. Vera Laski's Pueblo informant, Xa*.yctla*n, repeatedly requests, "Please be sure to tell your readers that the purpose of our ceremonies is not enter- tainment, but attainment." We should interpret this to mean-"We are not playing, enter- taining, or performing in the usual sense; we are working, worshiping, and acting on our en- vironment." This interpretation seems to be borne out by Laski's statement that "there are no spectators in the usual sense; there are only.. .participants."'7 It is imperative to draw attention to the fact that folk drama requires performers to enter in- to traditional fictive roles which differ significantly from their real or mundane roles, both social (such as "father" or "public official") and personal (such as "John Smith"). Mimesis, therefore, must be included in any definition of folk drama. Moreover, the impersonation witnessed at folk dramatic performances must be held distinct from the role-playing existing in popular or sophisticated drama. Professionalism contributes to some of this difference. More 14 Dell Hymes, "Breakthrough into Performance," in Folklore: Performance and Communication, eds.

As Bogatyrev has explained this phenomenon, "the audience in folk theater continually confronts the role which an actor-peasant plays with the actor's own private life.'""'8 At this juncture it is useful to note that ritual, too, often requires celebrants to doff their mundane selves and take on the trappings of nonordinary beings. The devotee of Haitian vodun adopts supernatural characteristics when ridden by the loa; the Hopi dons mask, costume, and body paint to become a kachina; the Pentecostal receives the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. This is not mimesis, that is, imitation; it is, rather, becoming the supernatural figure to give it form and presence. In the role-playing of folk drama, as Bogatyrev notes, the actor constantly peeps from behind the fictional mask and is never completely engulfed by it, as is the case in ritual possession. Not only the actors, but the personae of the folk play as well, often reveal an ironic impulse to break frame. The Bessy can by no means be seen as a female impersonation in the sense of the impersonators in the popular dramas of India and Indonesia; nor can the Hob- by Horse have any pretensions to verisimilitude. These characters, and many others in folk drama, exist to bring together jarringly the culture's traditional polarities: male and female, human and animal. While the figures of ritual may be grotesque, they are not grotesques meant to be seen through as entertaining fictions. The characters of ritual, then, to devotees have a reality that prohibits their being regarded as the products of mimesis. From another perspective, the mimesis of the folk theater deals in representation as opposed to the presentational qualities of other genres of verbal art. That is, while a storyteller will often stand down from his primary role of "reporter" to imitate the personae of a narrative, he invariably returns to the presentational mode as the narrator of events existing apart from himself, undertaken by characters he must describe in the third person. This has been distinguished by some scholars as the dramatic principle of transformation. Turning again to Bogatyrev we read: The poet may write a lyrical poem about Othello's jealousy and mean by this his own jealousy, but in drama. . .the artist must transform himself, must assume the person of Othello. ... In pure epic poetry the narrator narrates or sings about someone else in third person. He does not transform himself into that person but remains an objective observer of events relating to that third per- son or persons.19 Adherence to the principle of transformation as an essential component of drama becomes especially critical when we discuss certain traditional forms which may be termed, for the sake of convenience, proto-dramas.20 The term "proto-drama" is not intended to suggest an evolu- tionary relationship between such performances and drama "proper"; it is applied only to highlight the fact that some traditional pieces are so constructed as to allow single performers to utilize dialogue and thereby create the impression of the agonism seen in more truly is Petr Bogatyrev, "Semiotics in the Folk Theater," in Semiotics of Art, eds.

Titunik (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, 1976), p. 47. 19 Bogatyrev, "Forms and Functions of Folk Theater," p. 51. 20 Similarly, Jan Harold Brunvand has coined the term "proto-folksong" to designate traditional forms in which either words or music exist without the other's presence.

Adolescent routines21 such as the following fall into the proto-dramatic category. "The whip!" (The performer speaks in a bass voice, holding a handkerchief or a similar object under his nose to represent a moustache.) "No! No! Not the whip!" (The performer raises his voice to falsetto, holding a handkerchief or similar object to the side of his head to represent a bow.) "The whip!" (Same vocal tone and gesture used with first speech.) "No! No! Not the whip!" (Same vocal tone and gesture used with second speech.) "The whip!" (Same vocal tone and gesture used with first speech.) "No! No! Not the whip! Anything but the whip!" (Same vocal tone and gesture used with second speech.) "Anything?" (Same vocal tone and gesture used with first speech.) "The whip! The whip!" (Same vocal tone and gesture used with second speech.) It will be noted that even the bipartite structure of "dialogue" is not deemed adequate by the performer, for voice characterization and rudimentary costuming are also brought into ser- vice by the monologist in an attempt to represent the conflict between two personalities. And this, of course, is the essence of all forms of drama-the coexistence of multiple contexts, in- evitable when roles are distributed among two or more figures in a framed environment. Veltrusky's remarks are illuminating. "Dialogue," he maintains, "is a verbal utterance delivered by two or more alternating speakers; as a rule, they address their speeches to each other. Dialogue, therefore, differs from monologue in that it unfolds not only in time but in space."22 It is obvious, then, that for drama to exist, there must be not only the linguistic in- teraction that may arise in monologue, but the interplay of extralinguistic contexts that is available for exploitation only when individuals representing different semantic contexts (per- sonalities or principles), and spatial contexts (the characters' physical presence), may actually engage in confrontations. To complete the definition of drama it should be noted that the word "players" has been chosen over terms with more anthropomorphic connotations such as "actors." This neutrality encourages the consideration of traditional dramatic forms utilizing nonhuman casts as well. This latitude becomes critical in the consideration of the puppet theaters that are central to many folk traditions. Since puppet theaters often employ a single person to activate the entire cast, it might be argued that such performances are more like monologue than drama. It must be recognized, however, that the conventions of these forms demand that we disattend the puppeteer and regard the framed event on the stage as an interaction in its own right. Thus each puppet represents a semantic context with its own integrity, struggling to overcome other impulses and natures represented by the other figures it confronts-such performances must be considered dramatic. Any definition of folk drama must allow, therefore, for the in- clusion of these traditional forms. From the intradisciplinary perspective, these suggestions are intended to encourage a more systematic approach to future dialogue on folk drama. The label "folk drama," it has been 21 Brunvand describes similar routines; Ibid., p. 269. 22 Jili Veltrusk,, "Basic Features of Dramatic Dialogue," in Semiotics of Art, eds.

Given the acceptance of these guidelines, nonperformance role-playing, such as form- alized social interaction, would certainly cease to be confused with drama per se. Other forms, such as festival and ritual, that are also play activities and that incorporate many of the techni- ques of drama may be discussed in reference to folk plays. Since they do not function strictly as performances, however, they must not be confused with folk drama, strictly defined. Let us examine one instance of what is rapidly becoming a chronic misuse of the term folk drama by scholars outside the field of folklore. In an essay entitled, "Ritual Symbolism in Folk and Ritual Drama: The Mayo Indian San Cayetano Velacicdn, Sonora, Mexico," N. Ross and M. Louise Crumrine illustrate some of the misunderstandings engendered by the loose defini- tion of folk drama that prevails at this point.23 While the authors present a convincing argu- ment in their discussion of the symbolic core of this Mayo festival, it must be asserted that what they represent as drama is nothing of the sort. What they call a four act drama is not a performance at all. The first act consists of making the arrangements necessary for hosting a velaci6n. The activities set apart as the second act-ob- taining and "resting" the saint's image-are, like those of the first, predominantly utilitarian. While the third act does involve procession, prayer, and dance, the personnel act as worshipers and officiants rather than as performers and audience members. The fourth act is devoted to the return of San Cayetano's image to its resting place. If performance is in some way different from purely instrumental behavior, if it highlights ludus, if it requires a separation between per- formers and audiences, there is little in this velaci6n that can be said to fulfill these re- quirements. As to the second criterion of drama, there is clearly no mimesis in the velaci6n. The par- ticipants, as far as can be determined from the evidence presented, simply fill prescribed ceremonial roles. That is, the authors do not establish the fact that the personnel, within the frame of the Mayo festival, abandon ordinary personal identities in favor of what Erving Goff- man terms a "fictive or scripted identity.'"24 Moreover, even the most rudimentary dramatic performance contains some trace of the agonism which is conspicuously absent from the ac- tivities described by the authors. There are some designated roles in the velaci6n. The authors identify the maestro, the hosts, the dancers, the audience, and others. It is equally clear, however, that these roles do not con- stitute dramatis personae, but merely specialized functionaries: ceremonial managers and celebrants. The Crumrines also strangely designate the saint's image as "playing" the major role.25 This image, of course, is the focal point of the velaci6n and is occasionally manipulated during the procession to the site of the ceremony. In addition, Ross Crumrine has pointed out in a personal communication that puppets and even shadows play major roles in some folk dramas. As noted previously, however, nonhuman participants should be regarded as actors on- ly when shown to represent semantic domains through dialogue or similar animation. While the Crumrines' essay has been singled out for criticism, it is merely a single represen- tative example of a tendency to use an important term of folkloristics overzealously.

It seems incumbent on members of our discipline to reach internal agreement on exactly where the limits of folk drama lie or else to risk having the term rendered meaningless by the unwarranted extension of its boundaries.
