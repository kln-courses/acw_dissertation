This article endeavors to explain crying as an expression of emotion, in keeping with the present-day theories. Mr. Borgquist states that as a psychological problem it is very suggestive and also that a closer in- vestigation of the act itself may throwi more light upon the general theory of emotion. The question raised at the beginning of the article is whether in the crying act we are not dealing with a fundamental mode of expression which is the basis of displeasure in its most generic form. The article is divided into three sections. The first part deals with two hundred returns from a questionnaire which was sent out by President G. Stanley Hall to three normal schools and to the School of Ethical Cul- ture in New York City, and with the returns from twenty special letters and questionnaires which were sent to ethnologists of the Smithsonian Institution and to missionaries among the Japanese, Samoans, New Zea- landers, Maoris, etc. The questions have to do chiefly with the causes for crying among civilized and primitive peoples, the influence of age, cumulative development, symptoms and descriptions of the mental states involved in crying. The author makes a provisional classification of crying into the expression of anger, grief and joy. Each form is uni- versal among the races of mankind. The cry of the child and the cry clearly recognizes only the anthropomorphic factor in religion, whereas, Pro- fessor Ladd himself regards the transcendent factor, the sense of something more than and superior to man, as equally essential. In itself this fail- ure adequately to emphasize the superanthropomorphic factor might be allowed to pass. But it seems to me that it affects more or less the author's whole conception of the course of the evolution of religion. For example, Pro- fessor Ladd demurs to the representation of the development of Judaism as a straight course from polytheism to monotheism. In this I think he is right. His failure consists in not extending this judgment to the development of re- ligions in general. Only in exceptional instances can a straight evolution from polytheism to monotheism be made out. The existence of ' Creator Gods' in connection with lower conceptions and inferior deities ought to shed some light on the problem of the real course of the evolution. The truth seems to be that the two factors in religion-the anthropomorphic, wvhich is the fruit- ful source of polytheism, and the superanthropormorphic or transcendent, w hich tends more strongly to monotheism, are not necessarily, or always, in fact, found together. The motif of monotheism lies distinctively in the tran- scendent factor and will manifest itself wvhere this factor predominates; where the anthropomorphic factor predominates the motif of polytheism will domi- nate the course of the development. I am inclined to the opinion that a deeper insight into the workings of historical forces would bring out the fact of a dialectic of these fundamental motifs as determining the great mutations, the actions and reactions, as well as the side currents and eddies, of the develop- nmental movements of religion. MIuch as I admire Professor Ladd's treatment as a whole, I can not avoid the feeling that a fresh investigation of history would lead to some modification in the directions indicated. But I put this forward simply as a suggestion and with some diffidence in view of the obscurity that besets the whole question of the course of the development of religion.</page><page sequence="2">528 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of the adult are somewhat sharply differentiated. The child's cry is more often active, due to anger, noisy, directed outward, and is essentially the expression of helplessness and the demand for assistance. The cry of the adult is passive, due to grief, subjective, and is more an expression of hopelessness. " The cry is a profound disturbance, a large reaction, and no mere shedding of tears. It occurs as the end phenomenon of a cumu- lative development of feeling, a physical dualism which is characterized by a low stage of energy, or a stagnation of activity, accompanied by a condition which requires an effort out of proportion to the power of the organism. In the typical adult cry this schism between the power and the need increases until the outbreak of the cry comes. Whatever else the cry may be, it is a cessation of the state of strained effort, in the direction of a total giving up. The state of adjusted motor coordinations and attention, which the individual maintains normally in all situations of life, entirely ceases; it may be said that in place of a definite adjust- ment of nervous mechanism a state of wide diffusion quite the opposite of adjustment supervenes, and movements are no longer adaptive.... The will maintains the struggle after the disintegrative processes of pain are expressed in the physical inadequacy to respond to the demands of the situation. All cries can be reduced provisionally to this typical form." The second part of the article analyses the crying act and discusses its effect upon the individual and upon society. As in the first part the discussion begins with a consideration of the data provided by the ques- tionnaires, but it is supplemented and amplified by an appeal to literature of all sorts, from the Bible, Darwin and Sully, to Tennyson and Wier Mitchell. Mr. Borgquist concludes that the crying act is an extremely complex one, involving the whole body. Changes in circulation, certain characteristic attitudes of the body, lump in the throat, vocalization, sob and tears are the chief physical accompaniments. The prominence of any one of these symptoms depends principally upon the age of the individual. The sob belongs particularly to the adult cry. It comes as the climax of a crying spell and remains after the other symptoms have been repressed. Tears, as belonging particularly to the grief cry, are lacking with infants. According to different observers they appear at ages varying from one to five months. Of all the elements of the cry, they are least under the control of the will. They are characteristic of the cries of young children and primitive peoples. Vocalization appears first of all in the crying acts and is characteristic of the anger, fear and hunger cries. The lump in the throat is regarded as rather a mysterious element as to both its appearance and its make-up. The effect of crying is thought to be good by the observers, medical men and the writers of fiction. The good effect is mental rather than physical-a feeling of relief and the cessation of the nervous strain and tension. The physical effects are sometimes severe, resulting in headache, stupor, nausea, extreme weakness, etc., but the usual result is a state of physical exhaustion, rather pleasing than otherwise, which serves to</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 529 accentuate the mental relief. " Some medical opinion supports the view that crying is a helpful stimulation in the young child and that the cry resulting from grief aids a sluggish circulation and also affords some relief from a tension or overcharged condition of the nerves." The third part of the article undertakes a brief resume of the most prominent views in regard to crying, a study of crying as a physiological act and a statement of the author's own theory. This is the most im- portant part of the article. The preceding parts have simply prepared the way for a statement of Mr. Borgquist's explanation of the act, which he names the ' rejection theory.' The overflow theory of the expression of crying, the resistant theory and the language theory are found to be inadequate as explanations of the crying act in all its phases. The views of Wundt, Ribot and Darwin also need qualification or amplification, according to our author. From an examination of the accompaniments of the cry from a physiological standpoint, Mir. Borgquist concludes that the movements are the result of combinations of mechanisms that belong to the digestive and respiratory systems and that the greater part of the movements are controlled by the vagus nerve. Analyzing the individual elements in the cry, especially those accompanying the adult cry, they are found to be the same movements which are involved in the rejection of food. For example, the movements of the sob-a combination of downward pressure of the diaphragm, rhythmically performed, and ac- companying actions of the abdominal muscles-are identical with the movements involved in vomiting, with the exception of the movement of the stomach itself. The cause of tears is much more complex, but various movements which involve similar effects upon circulation and respiration will produce tears-namely, laughing, vomiting and coughing. The lump in the throat is obscure as a physiological event, but in vomiting and hic- coughing the throat undergoes a similar change. This similarity between the crying act and the movements of rejection applies especially to the adult cry-the cry of hopelessness. " The fear, hunger and anger cries are all essentially cries for help. The adult does not as a rule cry for help, but he helps himself through this stage and then at the end breaks down-a breakdown accompanied by body prostration, sobs, tears, lamen- tation and physiological movements of rejection." " The acts of crying are, thus, by no means a mere symbol of the act of giving up the struggle. The movements in themselves have significance and are a means towards an end. They are physiologically cessation and even reversal of the will to live and be nourished." A comparison of the actions of laughing and crying seems still further to support the 'rejection theory,' for though both are connected with the digestive system, laughing is the accompaniment of movements that promote digestion, and crying is a part of the process which is in its primitive form the rejection of food. " These movements-i. e., those of crying-are, according to this interpretation, a primitive form of expression on the physical side of the mental state of displeasure. The mental act and the physical act having</page><page sequence="4">530 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY never been dissociated from each other, the suggestion is made that, in more subdued form, some such actions occur as the correlate of all states of displeasure. The particular form of expression of helplessness by the cry has been preserved together with its subjective correlate, pity, as a fundamental psychosocial situation." NAOMI NORSWORTHY.
