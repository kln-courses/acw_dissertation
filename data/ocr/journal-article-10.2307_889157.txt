Many of these were familiar, but the organisers plucked two outstanding draw- ings from the Solomon R. Guggenheim col- lection: surprisingly, neither seems to have previously featured in a Giacometti exhibi- tion. The Guggenheim's Maloja landscape (no.143) could probably be slipped into a Cezanne show without too many people noticing the anomaly. There could be no greater tribute to a draughtsman.

Like a black hole, the mass of the figure seems to implode on itself, becoming thin, dense and dark, a sliver of a mirage that might suddenly vanish. It is easy to see why Sartre and Genet so ad- mired Giacometti. In addition to using the eraser and smudging the lines with his fin- gers, he sometimes corrected a line by draw- ing over it again and again, building the marks so thickly and densely that the head became a shiny black ball. One extraordi- nary drawing of a head (no.157) has be- come wrinkled and distorted becausevof the dense accumulation of graphite on paper. If Cezanne's quivering contour line de- notes hesitation, Giacometti's more fevered attacks stand for incomprehension. This approach could easily have become man- nered, but Giacometti used it sparingly. Most of the drawings in the show were in silvery pencil, but there were a few in pen-and-ink, ballpoint and brush. As ever, it was interesting to see a great artist having weak moments, and this was true of the drawings in coloured crayon (nos. 108, 1 10 and 1 12). In these rather precious works Giacometti deconstructs his own magic, and seems more concerned with making pictures than with grasping the nature of reality. But the presence of a few sub-stan- dard works is always helpful, demonstrating just how good are the rest. The few brush drawings were infinitely more beguiling. The best was the stunning Portrait of the artist's mother (1949; Fig.86) from the Muse- um of Modern Art, New York (the cata- logue gives incorrect measurements and records no previous exhibition history for this work, though it was shown in Edin- burgh in 1996). Here Giacometti handles his brush with all the precision of a surgeon wielding a scalpel. In the 1920s the drawings were made with short, nervous strokes but, as the dec- ades passed, so the mark-making became more confident and the drawings larger. The exhibition included a very comprehen- 316 Gingins, Vevey and Lausanne Kirchner;Jawlensky Erchner, expressionn?ste allurnand (1880- 1938) is an impressive two-part exhibition of work by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner at the Fondation Neumann, Gingins (to 10th June) and the Cabinet cantonal des estampes, Musee Jenisch, Vevey (closed 29th April). Kirchner is most famous as a member of the artists' group DiE Brucke, which he founded in Dresden in 1905 with Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff and Fritz Bleyl. He was also in the 1920s a key member and elder statesman of the Swiss Expressionist group Rot-Blau, whose existence was cut short by the tragic early deaths of its brightest lights, Hermann Scherer and Albert Muller. He is, therefore, already a familiar name in more northern 89. Iwo women, blonde and bmnette, by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. 1922. Coloured woodcut, 70.5 by 41 cm. (Private collection, Berne-Davos; exh. MuseeJenisch, Vevey). parts of Switzerland, the country in which he spent the last two decades of his life in self-imposed exile from his native Germany - at first because of illness and later out of fear in the face of Nazism. Yet, surprisingly, this exhibition brings the artist for the first time before a francophone Swiss audience. The Fondation Neumann opened in 1994 in the village of Gingins, near Nyons in a neatly converted stable block next to the fifteenth-century chateau which is still the home of Vera Neumann. Its aim is to present art from the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries across a diverse range, and especially work by people little known in this part of Switz- erland. At its heart is a collection of draw- ings, graphics and sculpture by impor- tant social realists, including Daumier and Kathe Kollwitz, and of art-nouveau objects, including furniture by Emile Galle, lamps by Tiffany and Galle, and a stunning collec- tion of glass on permanent display by Daum Freres, Argy-Rousseau, Tiffany, Galle and other key makers.' It is therefore highly appropriate that the part of the Kirchner exhibition on show in Gingins consists of paintings, drawings, sculptures, furniture and tapestries, reflecting the artist's own lifelong interest in effecting a synthesis of art and life entirely in keeping with the art nouveau aesthetic. Kirchner studied briefly with Hermann Obrist, a pioneer of the yu- getldstil in Munich in 1903 and was influ- enced when a student of architecture in Dresden by the ideas of the Belgian archi- tect and artist Henry van de Velde, whose * . name 1S synonymous Wlt n art nouveau.

This bohemian image is cleverly juxtaposed with a 1920 drawing of a farm family sitting down to a meal, signalling the existential connexions Kirchner perceived between the sexual freedom in one and the artlessness of the participants in the other. The unresolved character of Kirchner's own relationship with his urban past and rural present is conveyed in the compelling, melancholy Before sunrise - sef-portrait with Erna in font of the Wildboden House (1927; Fig.90), which depicts two central figures in middle age, flanked on one side by the carved, wooden figures of Adam and Eve before the Fall and on the other by a fecund mountain landscape. The second part of the exhibition at the Musee Jenisch presented more than a hundred prints in all media, and spanned the whole of Kirchner's career. The muse- um has two large spaces permanently de- voted to exhibiting prints, giving the viewer ample room to enjoy the full impact of individual works, while also conveying a sense of almost overwhelming breadth of activity. Like the show at Gingins, the print exhibition in Vevey is highly appropriate to its context. This is an active print cabinet, with a collection of more than 20,000 works spanning five hundred years of printmak- ing, and with an impressive series of ex- hibitions behind it, including two previous collaborations with the Fondation Neu- mann: Kathe Kollwitz (1994) and Effets de nuit (1998). The Expressionist connexion is also underscored by the museum's excel- lent holdings of important work by Oskar Kokoschka. Kirchner is arguably one of the most important artist-printmakers of the twenti- eth century in terms of his involvement in the complete process of intaglio, relief and lithographic printing from conception to execution. For him, the various print- making techniques functioned primarily as creative media in themselves, rather than as tools for reproduction of existing works or the creation of multiple images. As a result his 'editions' are almost invariably small and often consist of a series of unique states. As with another one-time Brucke mem- ber, Emil Nolde, the experimental aspect of printmaking was particularly important to Kirchner, often resulting in startling and compelling images, such as Chestnut trees in moonlight (1904), a little woodcut charac- terised by the use of fluid, painterly ink; the very large, stark woodcut portrait heads from 1919, carved out of oddly shaped, uneven blocks; and Winter landscape (1923), which characteristically takes advantage of imperfections in the lithographic stone and is printed in vivid ultramarine. Partly because of this experimental tendency Kirchner is not always an easy printmaker and some of his images demand not in- substantial work on the viewer's part. The curators have not balked at this aspect of his practice and some of Kirchner's most difficult images, such as the 1914 lithograph on yellow paper Riders in the Grfinewald, are included here along with other more easily digestible pieces (Fig.89). This is to be com- mended, especially in a show aimed at introducing an artist to a new audience. By seeing the character of the whole oravre, we are allowed to enjoy the full force of its * a pOSSl DL iltleS. Given the exhibition's quality and the fact that there is hardly any literature avail- able in French on Kirchner, it is unfortu- nate that there is no accompanying catalogue. This complaint cannot be lev- elled atJawbns en Su?sse 1914-1921, at the Fondation de l'Hermitage, Lausanne (to 13th May) and then at the Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum, Duisburg (30th June to 9th September), which boasts a hefty supporting tome.&gt; The exhibition cov- ers a crucial period inJawlensky's life, from his departure from Munich, where he had lived since 1896, at the outbreak of the First World War, to his return to Germany in 1921. During this time of travel and emo- tional and financial uncertainty, the Rus- sian artist established what were to become the artistic obsessions of the rest of his life. In Switzerland he began painting the series of variations on the human face and landscape for which he is now best known. These orchestrations of abstracted form and colour were created in a manner which had grown out of earlier post-fauvist experi- ments in Munich, conducted alongside his friend Wassily Kandinsky and the circle to his daughter Nele. Kirchner transformed his working and living spaces in Germany and Switzerland into exotic, bohemian environments using a mixture of non-European artefacts and furnishings either made by himself or to his designs. Sadly, none of these interiors is extant, although something of their nature can be gleaned from contemporary photo- graphs, paintings, drawings and prints, and from surviving objects collected and re- installed in Kirchner's final Swiss home. The exhibition has been organised in col- laboration with the Kirchner Museum, Davos, which has helped the Fondation Neumann to present pieces here which ac- curately reflect the breadth of the artist's activity. This includes two roughly carved anthropomorphic chairs from around 1920 (Fig.88), a fragile carved wooden compote and cushions embroidered to the artist's de- signs by his partner, Erna Schelling, and others, including the weaver Lise Gujer who made twenty-two tapestries, throws and tablecloths, together with six woven repro- ductions of Kirchner paintings (two of which are also included in this exhibition). The paintings are almost exclusively from the Swiss period and emphasise figure subjects, as opposed to the landscape pic- tures that are perhaps more familiar to those who are already aware of the artist's later work. This helps confirm the impor- tance of human intimacy which charac- 317</page><page sequence="3">EXHIBITION REVIEWS helm Lehmbruck, the dadaists Jean AIP, Marcel Janco, Sophie Taeuber-AIp and Hans Richter, and the strangely pervasive, but unclassifiable Paul Klee. Each signifies a specific place in this story. Jawlensky stayed first in the village of Saint-Prex on Lake Geneva, from where he made visits to Hodler, Klee, Igor Stravinsky and Cuno Amiet (another one-time Brucke member). In 1917 he moved to Zurich, where he encountered Lehmbruck and the dadaists, but left for Ascona in 1918 for health rea- sons. Here he discovered the utopian artists' community at Monte Verita and once again met Arp and Taeuber-Arp, as well as strik- ing up a friendship with Arthur Segal. In Saint-PrexJawlensky painted a series of pictures based on the view from the window of his room, with the generic title Variations, in which the scene, simplified to its basic elements - trees, road, houses - acted as an armature for experiments which took him close to abstraction (Fig.92). Because of his straitened circumstances he was forced to use oil on paper, mounted on board and to reduce the scale of his work. This resulted in a series of intimate pieces which, at their best, have all the still- ness and jewel-like qualities of Russian Icons. In spite of his apolitical nature, while in Zurich Jawlensky exhibited with the dadaists and attended their soirees. This is . . . . . not so surprlslng, glven the abstractlonlst leanings of Zurich dada and the at least implicit connexions with Jawlensky's pre- War existence - Arp and Klee had both had work reproduced in Kandinsky's and Franz Marc's Blue RiderAlmanac (1912) and Hugo Ball, one of the architects of dada, had stud- ied with Kandinsky in Munich in 1914. In Zurich Jawlensky began two new series designed to liberate the theme of the human face from the traditional conventions of portraiture, with the titles Mystical heads and Faces of the Redeemer (Fig.9 1).

The Adri- atic and the Aegean are justly considered to be another story. Nor does non-Christian north Africa, on the Tyrrhenian's other cusp, make an appearance. Sardinia, a feoff of Catalonia smack in the middle of this sea, gets short shrift - a single Cinquecento painting (cat. no.88) from a sanctuary in Piedmont. Portugal on the Atlantic is eli- minated by geographic definition, even though its art has a stylistic afEnity with that of the rest of the Iberian peninsula. However, sculptures and an enamel from northern France are included, whereas ceramics from Valencia, one of the princi- pal motors of Mediterranean trade, are not. A demographer surveying the almost one hundred objects, many of them master- pieces, would be surprised to learn that here the Mediterranean includes Lake Geneva, the navigli and lakes of Milan and the Scheldt River in Belgium. Indeed, this last location emerges, somewhat oddly, as the command centre. Although by the mid- 1 200s Genoese captains had navigated through the Straits of Gibraltar opening sea routes to the Low Lands, does that mean we should consider an object made in Bruges or Tournai as Mediterranean? The Boucicaut Master's missal (no.14), bought, probably in Paris, by the Lucchese merchant Lorenzo Trenta, is a good ex- ample of collecting by the Italian communi- ty trading in the north, but the missal made no impact on artists in landlocked Lucca. Encounters between the north and south or the specific presence of Netherlandish paintings in Italy, France and Spain are not what motivated the stylistic unity of mid-fifteenth-century art in the sea-faring cities and regions of Genoa, Naples, Barcelona, Venice, Sicily, Sardinia, and around the New Artists' Association, Mun- ich (NKVM), of which both were founder members. The earlier Jawlensky is repre- sented in Lausanne by paintings such as the fauvist Spamsh woman (c. 191 1), providing an instructive visual contrast to the less assertive Swiss work. The exhibition charts, through suggestive juxtaposition and generous use of wall texts, both Jawlensky's own development and the influence of particular and impor- tant meetings with other artists during the period. In addition to the continued pres- ence of Marianne von Werefkin, whose troubled long-term relationship with Jaw- lensky finally ended in 1921 shortly before he returned to Germany, there were the painter Ferdinand Hodler and sculptor Wil- 92.
