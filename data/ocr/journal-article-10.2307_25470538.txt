<plain_text><page sequence="1">VARIATION IN OHIO HOPEWELL POLITICAL ECONOMIES Matthew S. Coon / examine mortuary, artifactual, symbolic, and proxemic data from Hopewell sites in southwestern and south-central Ohio to suggest that people associated with south-central Ohio sites such as Hopewell and Seip implemented more exclusionary political strategies, while people at southwestern sites such as Turner and Fort Ancient maintained a more corporate ori entation through much of the Middle Woodland period. The recognition of this dimension of variation among Ohio Hopewell peoples has important implications for the study of the evolution of middle-range societies. Por medio del andlisis de multiples lineas de evidencia encontrados en sitios de Hopewell al sudoeste y al surcentral de Ohio, propongo que los habitantes de sitos como Hopewell y Seip utilizaban estrategias politicas exclusionarias mientras que los habitantes de sitos tales como Turnery Fort Ancient mantuvieron una estrategia politica corporativa durante la mayor parte del periodo Middle Woodland. El reconocimiento de esta variacion entre los antiguos habitantes de Hopewell en Ohio tiene implicaciones importantes para el estudio de la evolucion de estas sociedades de medio rango. The long-standing recognition that Ohio Hopewell differs markedly from other Hopewellian areas with respect to the inten sity of long-distance interaction, acquisition of exotic materials, production of craft items, and architectural design and construction of ceremonial centers resulted in a historical tendency to treat all manifestations of Hopewell in Ohio as one cultural unit, generally in distinction from other regional Hopewellian manifestations. Variation among Hopewell groups in Ohio with respect to ceramic production (Hawkins 1996; Pickard 1996), stone tool production (Harkness 1982), copper ear spool production (Ruhl 1992, 2006), settlement patterns (Pacheco 1996), and the distribution and architec tural forms of ceremonial centers (Byers 2004; DeBoer 1997) suggests that the cultural landscape was far from uniform, and researchers are increas ingly focusing upon these intra-regional differ ences. In this spirit, I examine several prominent Ohio Hopewell sites from south-central and south western Ohio from the interpretive standpoint of the Dual-Processual model of political economy. The Dual-Processual Model: Exclusionary and Corporate Strategies The Dual-Processual model of political economy, as suggested by Richard Blanton and his colleagues Gary Feinman, Steven Kowalewski, and Peter Pere grine (e.g., Blanton 1998; Blanton et al. 1996a; Feinman 2000; Feinman et al. 2000; Peregrine 2001), recognizes that social and cultural systems are influenced by the outcomes of competition and compromise among human actors with diverse (and often conflicting) political agendas. This model is based in part upon the observation that there are different power strategies and varying sources of power that are commonly utilized by political actors. These power strategies can be grouped into two main categories, exclusionary and corporate. In exclusionary power strategies, individuals attempt to develop "a political system built around their monopoly control of sources of power" (Blan ton et al. 1996a:2). In a network form of exclu sionary power strategy, political actors vie for preeminence by establishing ties or contacts with Matthew S.

This provides them access to marriage alliances, exotic goods, and esoteric knowledge (e.g., symbols used and rituals performed by distant peoples) that can be adopted locally to increase influence, to gain prestige and power, or to legitimate and maintain existing social asymmetries (Blanton et al. 1996a:4; Helms 1979, 1988). They may additionally bene fit from implications of power stemming from the association of danger with distant peoples and places (Helms 1979). Helms (1992:159) suggests that "contacts with geographically distant regions should be regarded as ideologically exceptional activities," and that persons who undertake such long-distance interactions should be considered political-religious specialists. Such specialists "may seek legitimation of the position through rites of investiture and adoption of personal and cere monial regalia" from distant places, and may under take expeditions or pilgrimages to those places (Helms 1992:161). The ability to successfully plan and undertake such long-distance ventures and to successfully interact and establish social relation ships with members of foreign societies may serve as evidence of leadership ability, increasing influ ence within the local group (Helms 1992:161). Materially, the network emphasis is often on items that are easily monopolized because they are difficult or costly to obtain or produce. These include objects such as craft items that require spe cial production knowledge, high labor investment, or familiarity with esoteric symbol systems, as well as rare or locally unavailable materials that are acquired from great distances (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Peregrine 1991). These items are tangible physical evidence of successful intersocietal inter actions, and by extension indices of leadership potential, and therefore may be used to bolster or legitimate prestige, influence, and political power among the local group (Helms 1992:161). In contrast to the exclusionary strategies out lined above, corporate strategies promote the main tenance of group solidarity while restricting the exercise of exclusionary power and discouraging individual prestige competition (Blanton 1998:151-154; Blanton et al. 1996a:2). This is accomplished through the promulgation of a cog nitive code that emphasizes the corporate solidar ity of society as an integrated whole, and often that idealizes egalitarian behavior (egalitarian behavior should be distinguished from egalitarian societies, which themselves are not entirely hierarchically flat [Flanagan 1989]).1 Strategies for promoting group solidarity include purposely sharing power across different social and political segments of society by means of shared membership in cross cutting social organizations (Blanton 1998:154, 159; Feinman 2000:213-214) and periodically gathering together all elements of society for coop erative labor events and communal ritual cycles that emphasize broad, abstract themes such as nature and renewal (rather than particularizing rit uals, such as ancestor veneration, that might be tied to specific individuals, descent groups, or other social segments rather than to the community as a whole). Corporate strategies are often designed to attenuate or undermine status differences. Materi ally, then, we would expect to see little display of differential access to potential prestige items by individuals and a lack of evidence for status dif ferentiation. Burial treatments may tend toward the communal, or should at least eschew highly indi vidualizing traits. This emphasis on community over the individual is also seen in nonmortuary contexts in corporate polities, which tend to be "faceless," with no clear individual rulers or rep resentations of prominent individuals (Peregrine 2001:37). Neither of the above strategies should be con strued as being more "natural" to human thinking or action than the other, nor is the pursuit of either corporate or exclusionary strategies more or less grounded in the manipulation of ideology by polit ical actors. Whichever form of political economic strategy may dominate in a particular context at a given time, there may be competition from social actors desiring to pursue opposing strategies. Indeed, this tension between proponents of corpo rate and exclusionary political economic strategies may be a significant mechanism of social change in many culturally and temporally disparate set tings. Having outlined the basic characteristics of cor porate and exclusionary strategies and some of their expected material correlates, I will now examine archaeological data from several major Ohio Hopewell ceremonial centers in order to evaluate whether corporate or exclusionary strategies appear to be more prominently evidenced in each area. These sites are located in two areas, one centered</page><page sequence="3">Coon] VARIATION IN OHIO HOPEWELL POLITICAL ECONOMIES 51 = Compound Geometric Enclosure \__1 J _J^y\^ *t\\ D = Hilltop Enclosure [f I IT jhrfs^k / y Hopewell \ y VjJ *h /FtAncient\\ C rKs &lt;^^^ Seip &gt;| /" N ) \Turner \? / t \K~' ^Ohio^~^R.

South-Central Ohio The Ross County area of south-central Ohio is home to the densest concentration of geometric earthworks in North America. These centers range in area from dozens of acres to over 100 acres, and some enclose large mounds containing elaborate burials and large deposits of craft items and exotic raw materials. Two of the largest geometric enclo sures in Ohio, the Hopewell site and Seip, lie in this area (Figure 1). The Hopewell Site (33R027) The Hopewell site is located along the north bank of the North Fork of Paint Creek in Ross County, Ohio (Figures 1 and 2). The site was described by Squier and Davis (1998 [1848]), and major exca vation work was carried out there by Warren K. Moorehead (1922) and Henry Shetrone (1926). Greber and Ruhl (2001) provide a partial overview of the site's excavation history. Evidence from the Hopewell site appears to con form to the expectations for a network strategy in a number of ways. There is ample evidence of aggrandizing behavior and the display of status items by individuals, as reflected in mortuary treat ments. The hoarding of exotic materials (such as copper, obsidian, and mica), craft items, and even production debris points to a network strategy with an emphasis on long-distance acquisition of and exclusionary access to exotic materials. These exotic materials are present in quantities that are sometimes orders of magnitude greater than those known from other Hopewell sites. Hoarding of obsidian, especially, approached monopolistic lev</page><page sequence="4">52 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 '' 'fr/iHMll/lf'J/W/^ N * ? f I I 0 300m Figure 2. The Hopewell Site. els (DeBoer 2004), with even waste material being curated. Hundreds of pieces of worked obsidian have been recovered from the site, many in the form of large, finely made ceremonial bifaces (although extreme fragmentation due to heat frac ture has prevented a firm estimate of the number of these bifaces; see Greber and Ruhl [2001], Moorehead [1922], and Shetrone [1926] for fur ther details). A deposit in Mound 11 contained over 135 kg of obsidian. James Griffin (1967:183-184) noted that this one deposit accounts for over 60 per cent of the total weight of Ohio Hopewell obsid ian, an observation that remains essentially accurate despite four decades of subsequent discoveries. Cowan and Greber (2002) made a preliminary examination of this material and noted that it is con sistent with expectations for debitage from the pro duction of the large obsidian bifaces found elsewhere at the Hopewell site. They also note that the smaller sized flakes are absent from the deposit, which suggests that the debitage was removed from its original production context and curated. Obsid ian hydration rim measurements using optical (Hatch et al. 1990) and secondary ion mass spec trometry (Stevenson et al. 2004) analyses suggest that the debitage was produced and curated over a period of centuries, although technical problems with the optical method introduced a bias into the earlier set of dates (Hughes 1992; Stevenson et al. 2004). The presence of both raw materials and curated manufacturing debris at the Hopewell site suggests attempted control not only of access but also of production. Seip (33RO40) The Seip earthworks (Figures 1 and 3) are located in the Paint Creek valley roughly 27 km southwest of the city of Chillicothe. Seip is one of a number of tripartite earthworks (generally consisting of a square plaza area connected to two circular enclo sures) within a roughly 50 km area (Greber 1979a, 1979b). Two large mounds located within the larger</page><page sequence="5">Coon] VARIATION IN OHIO HOPEWELL POLITICAL ECONOMIES 53 Iff H -ii^fS~^X5P^J\i^^l^ stmcmres ,, ^'?k-'---**K^ ? . ?- --\ Area 27 Acres. VA Figure 3. The Seip earthworks. Inset shows the approximate location of the possible craft workshop structures within the enclosure (from Baby and Langlois 1979:Figure 4.2; Squier and Davis 1998 [1848]:Plate XXI, No. 2). circular enclosure were excavated by William C. Mills (1909) and Henry Shetrone (Shetrone and Greenman 1931). Each mound covers a large mul tiroom ceremonial structure, or Great House (Gre ber 1983). Unfortunately, Mills and Shetrone employed different (and conflicting) numbering systems for the two mounds, and so it has become conventional to refer to the mounds by non-numeric names. The larger central mound (Shetrone and Greenman 1931) is referred to as the Pricer mound, or Seip-Pricer. The smaller conjoined mound (Mills 1909), or Seip-Conjoined, never received a final mantle of earth that would join the three sections together into one, as was the case with the Seip Pricer mound. Consequently, the Seip-Conjoined mound may date later than Seip-Pricer mound. Data from Seip-Conjoined were not reported ade quately for most analytical purposes, and the field notes from its excavation are lost (Greber 1976:55). Therefore, the bulk of our knowledge about cere monial activity at Seip comes from the Pricer mound. While exotic materials and lavish burials are present at Seip, it is less materially rich than the Hopewell site (Carr 2006:278), and the strategies evidenced there differ from the network strategy described above. Instead of obtaining large quan tities of materials from distant locations, people at Seip apparently employed a strategy involving the intensification of production of craft items, as well as an intensification of feasting activity. Textiles. The reports from major Hopewell cen ters abound with passing references to the quanti ties of textiles encountered during excavations. However, more textiles have been recovered from Seip than from any other Hopewell center in Ohio, with Seip textiles comprising about half of the total textiles recovered from 10 different sites (Hinkle 1984). It seems unlikely that this disparity can be explained only in terms of differential preservation and recovery. The finest textiles recovered from Seip have been described as being twined at one-half the scale of the finest textiles from either Hopewell or the Edwin Harness Mound (33R022) (Church 1983:10). The Seip examples are also consistently finer than other textile types found both at Seip and Hopewell or at Harness (Church 1984:8). Among most of the densely woven Seip textiles, the weft</page><page sequence="6">54 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 Table 1.

A tabulation of average cordage density at several sites was made using the number of warp and weft cords per inch as reported by Charles Willoughby (1938). Cordage density was calculated by multi plying the number of warp plies per inch by the number of weft plies per inch, and averages were calculated for each fabric type, for each site, and for each fabric type at each site (Table 1). The results suggest a greater labor investment at Seip, where densities were on average over 1.5 times greater than at Hopewell, and nearly three times greater than those from Harness. One coarsely twined piece of fabric from Seip was not included because Willoughby (1938:284) considered it to be from a cloth bag rather than a shroud or article of clothing. Inclusion or omission of this textile fragment does not significantly alter the results in Table 1. Other studies of Hopewell textiles have consis tently found similar patterns. Amanda Thompson (2003) found that textiles from Seip have a higher thread count in the warp dimension than similar tex tiles from Hopewell and Tremper (33SC4), and using a classification and regression tree she demonstrated that Seip textiles are distinguishable from Harness, Hopewell, and Tremper textiles on the basis of the their high thread count in the warp dimension (Thompson 2003:118, 128-129). Church (1984) found that spaced alternate-pair twined fabrics from Seip Mound 1 had average warp and weft spacings measuring about 47 per cent of those from the Hopewell site and 42-43 per cent of those from Harness. Interestingly, the single oblique interlaced textile from Seip Mound 2 had a weft spacing an order of magnitude finer than comparable textiles from the other sites. Virginia Wimberley (2004:76) also found that spaced alternate-pair twined and oblique interlaced fabrics from Seip had higher thread counts than those from the other sites in her sample. These textiles required a substantial labor invest ment for production. Wimberley (2004:81) notes that thousands of hours of labor, from raw mater ial collection and processing to spinning and ply ing, would be required just for the production of cordage for the textiles. Flora Church reports that a modern weaver has estimated it would take over 1,500 hours to produce the amount of cordage required for a small bag, less than .5 m square, "using the same pattern at the same scale" as the finely woven textiles from Seip (Church 1983:11, 1984:11). A substantial labor cost would also have been involved in twining the cordage after it was spun and plied. It took volunteers at the Ohio His torical Society over a year and a half to replicate a (presumably) more coarsely twined 54.6 mm by 83.8 mm (21.5 in by 33 in) blanket from the Ray mond Ater Mound (33R063), using commercially available cotton yarn (Kime 1986). However, an unspecified part of this time was devoted to the cleaning and preservation of shell beads, and so this evidence is more anecdotal than quantitative. A number of textile fragments from Seip are dis tinctive among Hopewell textiles because they were dyed or painted with colorful designs. Burials 2,4, and 5 of the Multiple Burial in the first section of the Pricer Mound had "typical Hopewell designs," colored yellow and outlined in black against a maroon background (Shetrone and Greenman 1931:451-454; Willoughby 1938). Burials 9 and 11, which were adjacent to and stratigraphically beneath the Multiple Burial (Greber 1976:80), con tained similarly colored fragments. Burial 28, also in the first mound section, contained colored fab</page><page sequence="7">Coon] VARIATION IN OHIO HOPEWELL POLITICAL ECONOMIES 55 ric that is noted but not pictured or described in the site report (Shetrone and Greenman 1931:387). Burial 86, one of three cremations in an elaborate log crypt in the middle section of the mound, con tained red and yellow fabric found preserved on a copper plate (Shetrone and Greenman 1931:399-400). Similarly painted or dyed fabrics are not yet known from other Hopewell centers, but research into detecting traces of colorants on tex tiles in museum collections is ongoing (Baldia 2005; Baldia and Jakes 2007; Baldia et al. 2008). Willoughby (1938:278,285-286) noted that one textile fragment from Seip (Peabody Museum No. A5925-Z) is made of two single primary twisted strands of vegetable (bast) fiber that were wrapped with rabbit hair that had been colored red. These wrapped cords were then twisted together in pairs to form single secondary twist cords, which were finally braided together to form the fabric. Micro scopic examination of similar textile fragments from Seip has recently shown that the rabbit hairs they contain were stained multiple different colors (Baldia 2005:69). Song etal. (1996) concluded that these special fabrics may have been reserved for ceremonial use by a select subset of society (Song et al. 1996:261-262). Baldia (2005) determined that the designs on Seip textiles are more complex than had previously been recognized. While some fabric fragments appear to have been painted with inorganic min eral pigments, others were found to have been dyed in patterns that suggest a resist-dyeing technique had been employed (Baldia 2005:93; cf. Willey and Phillips 1944:182). Resist dyeing is a multiple step process in which an impermeable substance such as wax, clay, or resin is applied to portions of a fabric in order to prevent dye from penetrating those areas. After dyeing, the resist material is removed, leaving negative undyed space. Repeat ing this process could allow the creation of poly chrome designs. Resist dyeing requires special materials, knowledge, and skill, and the only other archaeologically known examples of the use of resist dyeing in North America come from Spiro Mounds in Oklahoma and date from nearly 1,000 years later (Kuttruff 1993). Baldia (2005) believes that the development of this complex technique at Seip indicates the presence of artisans specializing in the production of textile crafts. There is evidence at Seip suggesting the con spicuous consumption of textiles. The Multiple Burial was covered with a large canopy of fabric, which was fastened down with "a hundred or more" bone pegs (Shetrone and Greenman 1931:372). Significantly, this canopy may have been made from decorated fabric bearing ovate, lobed, and ellipsoid turquoise designs, although poor docu mentation of provenience does not permit these textile fragments to be attributed to the canopy with absolute certainty (Thompson 2003). Baldia (2005) examined fabric fragments with applied turquoise and white designs including one of the fragments previously examined by Thompson (2003), and considered them to have potentially originated from the cloth canopy (Christel Baldia, personal com munication 2008). These fragments are "very fine and sheer, almost resembling sheer curtain mater ial," and the production of this fabric would have been very labor intensive (Baldia 2005:95). This material was painted with copper salts and a white clay, possibly kaolin, to produce a turquoise and white design; a mirror image of this design may have also been painted on the reverse side (Baldia 2005:73,97). There is also other evidence suggesting the con spicuous consumption of textiles at Seip. Burial 28, one of the burials with colored fabric in the first mound section, was a single cremated adult on an unusually large platform that was covered over with fabric (Shetrone and Greenman 1931:387). Burial 65 was noted as being covered with "a consider able quantity of charred fabric" (Shetrone and Greenman 1931:469). Twelve copper plates and a large copper celt in the Ceremonial Cache were sep arated by and intermixed with as many as 13 lay ers of fabric (Shetrone and Greenman 1931:380). Clusters of small post molds were found near the large central graves in the primary section of the Seip-Conjoined mound, and "frequently the floor around the posts would be covered with great quan tities of charred cloth, ornaments, and implements" (Mills 1909:286). There are numerous additional references to quantities of fabric in the mounds at Seip and at other sites. Unfortunately, in few of these cases is the quantity or weave of the fabric described, precluding intersite comparisons. Given the amount of fabric consumed at Seip, and the amount of labor necessary to produce it, it is not entirely surprising that Virginia Wimberley (2004) has noted that a higher number of the tex</page><page sequence="8">56 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 tile fragments adhering to copper plates from Seip (nearly half, as opposed to one each from Hopewell and the Rockhold site [33R039]) appear to con tain cords spun by more than one individual.2 Con sidering the intensity of textile production and consumption at Seip, a strategy involving the com bined labor of multiple individuals is logical and was perhaps necessary. Altogether, I believe that the above evidence suggests an intensification of textile production at Seip in comparison to other Hopewell centers in Ohio. Ceramics and Feasting. Pottery at Seip also stands out in comparison with pottery from other Ohio centers. High quality wares from Seip repre sent "the best expression of Hopewell ceramics in all of Ohio" (Prufer 1968:84). They are described as being carefully made, well-fired, hard and vit reous, and polished to the point of having a glossy sheen (Prufer 1968:7-8, 84-85). Zoned decora tion, typical of Hopewell ceremonial wares, is "more common at Seip than at any other Ohio site," and "rim treatment is of high quality" (Prufer 1968:85). Sherds of high quality Seip Plain vessels are found in small amounts at other sites, includ ing 11 at Fort Ancient (Sieg and Sunderhaus 2004), six at Hopewell and two each at Harness, Mound City (33R032), and Turner, versus 87 sherds at Seip (Prufer 1968:7). The predominance of their occurrence at Seip suggests that high quality ceram ics were made locally for use there, although the paucity of published petrographic and source analy sis studies on Hopewellian ceramics in Ohio leaves this question unresolved for the moment. It is like wise not known whether the Seip Plain sherds found at other centers represent pots that were local products or if they were received and transported from Seip. Evidence for the exchange of ceramics in the Scioto region (Carr and Komorowski 1995) leaves the latter possibility open. Petrographic stud ies may eventually provide more conclusive evi dence (Lynott 1995). Another remarkable aspect of Seip ceramics is the presence of large serving platters in the assem blage. These are "large, shallow plates or dishes with straight, nearly horizontal, rims, and rounded bases" (Prufer 1968:86). Small bowls have been found at other centers, such as Hopewell, Mound City, Fort Ancient, and Turner, which might reflect small-scale feasting activities. Such feasting was probably common in conjunction with various types of gatherings and activities. Concentrations of animal bone at Mound City and other sites (See man 1979) and the discovery of a large oven at the Hopewell site (Ruby et al. 2006:155) may also give support for feasting activity in south-central Ohio. The large platters, however, appear to be unique to Seip, and may indicate an intensification and increased scale of feasting activities at that center. An increased scale of feasting may indicate the presence of larger populations, possibly including members of other allied regional communities or polities (Carr 2006; Junker 2001), and may require greater mobilization of local labor for preparations. More intensive feasting may also reflect rewards or enticements to local population members for their increased labor investments in textile pro duction and other skilled labor activities (Dietler 2001; Dietler and Herbich 2001). This type of selec tive incentive (a reward given to a select popula tion in exchange for a particular service) may be common in situations where leaders otherwise pro vide few public goods or services (Fargher and Blanton 2007:876-877). Craft Workshops. An additional and potentially important facet of political economic behavior at Seip was uncovered during excavations by the Ohio Historical Society between 1971 and 1977, when a number of small post structures were discovered inside the large circular embankment (Figure 3, inset). Seven of these structures were fully uncov ered and found to contain numerous pit features. They appear to be localized, all being erected roughly midway between the large central mound and the surrounding circular embankment, and none more than 5.5 m from another (Baby and Lan glois 1979:16-17). These structures had been decomissioned and covered over with low mantles of redeposited fill containing tools, animal bone, mica, shells, and Hopewell artifacts, as well as mixed time-period debris. The stratigraphic rela tionships among these deposits are not clear from the field documentation, and the source of the fill material is not known, but was likely from the gen eral vicinity. The structures and their mantles con tained lamellar blades, mostly used and broken, and large numbers of potsherds, but no apparent domestic debris. Some contained lithic microtools and other specialized implements. One of these structures (Site 1) was associated with large quantities of mica (including geometric</page><page sequence="9">Coon] VARIATION IN OHIO HOPEWELL POLITICAL ECONOMIES 57 cutouts), and was interpreted by Raymond Baby as being a craft workshop (Baby and Langlois 1979:16-17). Site 2 also contained worked and unworked mica pieces. Site 7 contained quantities offish scales and deer and other animal bone (Baby and Langlois 1979:18; Seeman 1979:41), which may have resulted from food preparation for feast ing (see above). The uses of the remaining struc tures are not obvious, but several were associated with specialized tools such as scrapers, reamers, and burins, and may have been work areas used for the production of "the elaborate ceremonial and ornamental objects for which Hopewell is noted" (Baby and Langlois 1979:18). Baby went so far as to suggest that these supposed craft workshops indi cated the presence of a special artisan class. While this is almost certainly an overstatement, the pres ence of formal craft production areas inside the walls of a ceremonial center, within view of a large ceremonial structure, and apparently in an area of the center allocated specifically for craft produc tion activities would suggest the periodic and socially sanctioned presence in the ritual precinct of a number of skilled artisans working at a level of formality above the domestic context (Spiel mann 1998, 2002). Given the potential redeposi tion of materials and the poorly understood stratigraphy around the Seip structures, however, their interpretation as craft workshops must be taken very cautiously. Artifact concentrations containing nonlocal materials have been interpreted as specialized activity areas at the Hopewell and Hopeton sites (Ruby et al. 2006), and the curation of obsidian debitage at the Hopewell site may indicate that obsidian biface production took place on site, although the context of obsidian craft production (which should be marked by the large quantity of small flakes missing from the Mound 11 obsid ian deposit) has not yet been discovered at that site. Two structures near Fort Ancient in south western Ohio have been interpreted as lamellar blade production workshops (Cowan 2006), but these lie outside of the enclosure, and I would dis tinguish tool production from the type of craft production surmised at Seip. Small amounts of exotic materials such as mica, galena, copper, and obsidian were recovered from a refuse pit (carbon dated to the third or fourth century CE) located on the exterior of a structure located inside the North Fort at Fort Ancient (Lazazzera 2004:92-93). However, the exotic materials were not described as representing craft production debris, and the structure was interpreted as a gen eral domestic structure rather than a craft work shop (Lazazzera 2004). Apart from the potential evidence for craft workshops at Seip, associa tions of craft production artifacts with structures inside other major Ohio Hopewell centers have thus far remained elusive. Southwestern Ohio Turner (33HA41) The Turner site (Figures 1 and 4), located near the junction of the Little Miami and Ohio Rivers in Hamilton County, Ohio, was excavated sporadi cally by the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, under the supervision of F. Ward Putnam from 1882 to 1911 (Greber 1976). The details and results of these excavations were compiled and published by Charles Willoughby in 1922 (Willoughby 1922). The site has since been converted to a gravel quarry. Evidence from the Turner site appears to con form to the expectations for a corporate political orientation. While some burials at the Turner site were placed in earthen mounds, no mounds at Turner approached the monumental size of those at Hopewell and Seip, and of the 16 known mounds at the site, only six were found to contain burials. Most burials at Turner were instead placed in a large communal burial area, the "Burial Place within the Great Enclosure" (Figure 5; marked as "e" in Figure 4). F. Ward Putnam speculated in his field notes of 22 September, 1886 (Greber 1979a:52) that the Burial Place "was probably orig inally an oblong mound through which the road has been cut." However, no such mound is noted in T C. Day's 1839 site description (Willoughby 1922:2) or in Charles Whittlesey's 1850 map of the site (Whittlesey 1852). The Great Enclosure was first plowed in 1825, and traces of a large mound would probably not yet have been obliterated through cul tivation by these early dates. If the Burial Place had been mounded, it was probably a very low mound rather than a large monument such as Mound 25 of the Hopewell group or the Pricer mound at Seip. Graves in the Burial Place were in the form of sub terranean stone vaults (Figure 6).

The Turner Burial Place (from Willoughby 1922:Plate 3). the 55 burials recovered from the unknown total number at the Turner Burial Place, no individual was buried with a disproportionately large amount of such items. In the words of Charles Willoughby, "comparatively few artifacts were found with the skeletons" (Willoughby 1922:15). This suggests a de-emphasis on the accumulation and display of exotic materials and politically charged craft items such as copper celts, rectangular copper plates, and copper headdresses, which appeared to have been status symbols and social identity markers (Carr 2006:280-286; Greber 1976, 1979a; Greber and Ruhl 2001). No rectangular copper plates were clearly associated with individuals at Turner, and no copper headdresses were recovered from the site (Greber 1979a:57; Willoughby 1922). In an analysis of the Turner burials, N'omi Greber found no statistically significant differences in artifact accompaniments for single versus multiple graves, or for cremated versus noncremated burials (Gre ber 1976, 1979a:53). No significant differences were found based upon age or sex, and her overall impression for the site was "one of crosscutting dif ferentiations rather than one of strong hierarchies" (Greber 1979a:54). Dual Organization. Greber's impression of socially cross-cutting differentiations at Turner is noteworthy, as it is consistent with the integrating mechanisms of a corporate political strategy in which power struggles are minimized by joining members of various social segments together via membership in cross-cutting social institutions (Blanton 1998:154,159; Feinman 2000:213-214). For instance, the only consistent difference among burials appears to have been one of grave orienta tion, with a North-South group and an East-West group in the Burial Place (Greber 1976:124-130). Each spatially distinct group contained a cross section of the population, and no marked differ ences between the groups in status or access to wealth items were noted. This type of dual social division suggests that a moiety organization may have been in place at Turner.3 In a dual organization or moiety system, a soci ety is divided into distinct but complementary paired segments. Moiety organizations integrate by distributing membership across social divides, and members of opposite moiety segments may</page><page sequence="12">60 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 Figure 6. Examples of graves in the Turner Burial Place (from Willoughby 1922:Plate 4a-e). have complementary reciprocal obligations to each other. Moieties often regulate marriage patterns exogamously, and may also help to regulate col lective labor cycles (Levi-Strauss 1967:149-150). Most importantly, moiety organizations institu tionalize power sharing across clans, kin groups, and other potentially antagonistic social divisions. Moiety structures may range from a two-part oppo sition, as appears to be the case at Turner, to much more complex systems of crosscutting layers. The Ilahita moiety system in New Guinea, for exam ple, was comprised of eight layers of dual divisions (Tuzin 2001:78). Regardless of the number of dual divisions, each moiety grouping might ideally be expected to be of roughly the same size, since the dual organization crosscuts the entire society. In practice, however, the actual proportions frequently vary due to demographic fluctuations (Tuzin 2001:107-109) and the dynamics of social asym metry between moiety segments. It is important to note that the presence of a moiety system does not necessarily imply a lack of hierarchy or social asymmetry. Levi-Strauss (1967) has pointed out that asymmetries inherent in dual organizations have generally been understressed in the anthro pological literature in the interest of emphasizing the assumedly equal relationships between moiety segments. This may stem from a lack of distinction by anthropologists between the ideology of moi ety organizations, which encourages cooperation and stresses symbolic equality, reciprocity, and symmetry between complementary divisions of the whole, and the realities of much more uneven sociopolitical landscapes. Levi-Strauss (1967:130) observed that "the rela tionship between moieties is never as static, or as fully reciprocal, as one might tend to imagine." (His description of an apparent vertical shift in sta tus between the Chera and Tugare moieties of the Bororo of South America is germane here [Levi Strauss 1967:141-142].) Perhaps the presence of a moiety system should not be construed as imply ing static and uncontested equality, but rather as an attempt to mitigate the threat of social atomism in the face of competition among factions who are constantly renegotiating their relative statuses and contesting the status quo. Moiety structures then might be better viewed as corporate strategies to</page><page sequence="13">Coon] VARIATION IN OHIO HOPEWELL POLITICAL ECONOMIES 61 maintain social integration among competing fac tions, thereby easing tensions and lessening the risk of permanent rifts developing in the structure of society. Asymmetries among moiety segments may be manifest spatially in the layouts of settlements and ceremonial structures, in cemetery organization, and in the social composition of dual divisions. The Winnebago of North America, for example, had 12 clans divided equally into three groups (earth, water, and sky) but asymmetrically into two moi eties: "earth" (earth and water clan groupings) and "above" (sky clan grouping only) (Levi-Strauss 1967:151). Thus, the lower Winnebago moiety con sisted of members of eight clans, while the upper consisted of only four. Assuming clan sizes to be roughly equal (an admittedly shaky assumption), about two-thirds of the population would belong to the lower moiety while only around one-third would belong to the upper. Imbalances and fluctu ations in clan size might lessen or amplify imbal ances in moiety membership. Archaeological evidence suggests that a roughly similar situation was present at Turner, with 33 individuals (61 percent) in the East-West spatial group and 21 individuals (39 percent) in the North South spatial group, counting both cremated and noncremated remains.4 Considering only noncre mated individuals, there is an interesting sub grouping within each of these directional clusters, with six individuals having heads pointing to the east (25 percent) and three having heads pointing to the north (23 percent), in contrast to the more prevalent western and southern orientations. These are a consistent proportion of both groupings, and so may represent a socially real subset (possibly another dual division, although the proportions seem rather far out of balance). Overall, the dif ferences in burial orientation in the Turner ceme tery do appear to fall within the expected bounds for a moiety organization, a type of integrating mechanism consistent with a corporate orientation. Iconography and Costume. The iconography at Turner also appears to indicate the presence of a corporate cognitive code, as can be seen in contrast with similar items from the Hopewell site. Both sites have produced boat-shaped effigies, with those at Hopewell (e.g., Burial 281, Mound 25) offering realistic (although possibly symbolically loaded) depictions of animals. At Turner, two boat-shaped carvings recovered from Altar 1, Mound 4 repre sent imaginary creatures or chimeras (Willoughby 1922:70-71). One depicts a three-dimensional quadrupedal horned serpent, having a reptilian head with two sets of horns and a segmented tail, possi bly with rattles (Figure 7a-c). On the other carv ing, an incised drawing shows a billed animal with flippers or fins and a tail (Figure 7d-e). Such myth ical and composite creatures, especially when found as part of an offering as they are at Turner, are identified by Renfrew (1985:23-24) as often representing cult images. This interpretation is bol stered by the recurrence of such images in similar contexts (Renfrew 1985:15?16).5 A small deposit at the perimeter of Mound 3 contained an effigy of a fish with a rattlesnake tail carved from antler (Willoughby 1922:35). The two boat-shaped effi gies from Altar 1, Mound 4 were accompanied by what may have been a horned serpent effigy cut from mica, incised and possibly painted, and with attachments for appendages made of other materi als (Willoughby 1922:67-69).6 The central altar of Mound 3 contained a number of cut copper pieces which together may form portions of a horned ser pent costume, with elements representing horns, eyes, and possibly scales (Willoughby 1922:47^19, Plate 11). Overall, the evidence from multiple deposits at Turner may reflect the presence of an Underworld cult. Given this, Romain's (1996) asso ciation of hilltop enclosures, which are common in southwestern Ohio (see below), with Underworld symbolism and cosmologically significant loca tions suggests that this ideological orientation may have some temporal depth in southwestern Ohio. Whether such a cult existed or the Underworld symbolism at Turner simply represents one aspect of a larger ritual program, the ceremonial empha sis on broad cosmological and impersonal super natural themes in southwestern Ohio would be generally consistent with a corporate orientation. Both Turner and the Hopewell site have pro duced engraved human bones depicting realistic avian and mammalian designs. At Turner, however, an engraved human ulna (Figure 8) from Altar 1, Trench a, embankment, shows anthropomorphic horned chimeras or unidentifiable kachina-like creatures (Willoughby 1922:8-9:Plate 2) that I interpret as humans in costume (possibly includ ing a horned serpent costume such as that from the central altar of Mound 3).

Engraved human ulna from Turner Mound 4, Altar 1 (from Willoughby 1922:Plates 2d-2i). from Hopewell Mound 25 also appears to show a mix of human and animal features (Figure 9). Rather than representing masked cult figures, how ever, this engraving appears to show humans wear ing copper headdresses similar to those found associated with some burials at the site (Willoughby 1935). (Carr and Case [2006] and Cowan [1996] provide alternate interpretations of this artifact.) Two of these were effigy deer antler headdresses which were placed in the same mound (Mound 25, in association with Burials 248 and 260-261 or 278).7 These were of different designs, with one depicting branching antlers and the other emerg ing buds (Figure 10a and b), and both types appear to be represented simultaneously in this carving, along with other images (Moorehead 1922:126 128,161-162). Such headdresses, while very rare, are not unique to the Hopewell site, but they do occur there in greater frequency and elaboration than at any other (Mills 1922). The contrasts between the costumes represented in these two symbolic expressions engraved in bone are suggestive. At Hopewell, headdresses empha size the identity of the wearer by drawing attention to the face, or at least by not obscuring the facial features. Headdresses play a special role as status signaling items. Wobst (1977) defined his Dress Category 1, items visible over long distances, to include headdress. As noted previously, items in this category impart information to the largest, most inclusive social group with which the wearer is affiliated. Being highly visible, headdress is often</page><page sequence="16">64 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 Figure 9.

Two copper antler headdresses from the Hopewell site: (a) Mound 25, Burial 260-261, (b) Mound 25, Burial 248 (from Greber and Ruhl 2001:Figures 4.8 and 4.15). crucial in communicating social or ethnic affilia tion and in boundary maintenance (Wobst 1977:332-333). At closer viewing distances, how ever, "the message content shifts from identifying social groups to defining an individual's position along a ranked scale" (Wobst 1977:335). Peter Peregrine, in a cross-cultural analysis of ethnographically described prestige items, found headgear included in two of his statistically derived clusters (Peregrine 1992:Table 4.5). Cluster Three consisted of personal adornments "manufactured from animal materials or precious metals that are often locally available" (Peregrine 1992:57). These are generally political or status symbols and are sometimes placed in graves (Peregrine 1992:59). These items tended to be restricted to high-status adult males, and many were symbols of political office (Peregrine 1992:58). Peregrine's Cluster Seven items are made of plant or animal materials, sometimes of nonlocal origin, and are often red in color (note that polished copper is reddish). They are sometimes placed in graves, but are rarely traded (Peregrine 1992:59). These items are gen erally restricted to high-status males and tend to be symbols of ritual or political office. Hopewell copper headplates and animal effigy headdresses seem to fall within or between these categories. They are made of red nonlocal metal and occasionally of plant materials worked into the form of an animal material (such as deer antlers). They are restricted to adult males (Carr 2006:282) and are probably associated with the specific indi viduals over whose graves they were placed. Under Wobst's criteria, these headdresses would have been the most definitive and emphatic communi cators of an individual's ranked position of all of the Hopewell status markers. Further, they could convey this information to large groups of people, including the large crowds who may have period ically converged for scheduled ceremonies. These items appear to be consistent with "symbols of rit ual or political office" (Peregrine 1992:59), and with an exclusionary power strategy. Christopher Carr (Carr 2006; Carr and Case 2006) equates them with symbols of shamanistic leadership at the com munity level (in the case of animal headdresses) and civil leadership above the local community level (in the case of plain copper headplates). Their con centration at the Hopewell site is interesting, as is their absence from the Turner site. I think that the Turner engraving, on the other hand, appears to depict masked individuals, possi bly portraying figures in a communal Underworld cult or world renewal ceremony.8 The wearing of</page><page sequence="18">66 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 masks effectively obscures the identity of the wearer, allowing personal identity and social sta tus to be disembedded from positions of leadership and ritual authority. Masks help to reduce political tensions in potentially atomistic communities (Steiner 1990:438) and "are useful in defusing fac tional competition" (Mills 2000:8). Masking allows anonymous criticism of improper behavior by members of a community, or criticisms by subor dinates of leaders' transgressions, without fear of recrimination or retaliation (Steiner 1990:442). Faceless authority and the use of masked costum ing are consistent with a corporate political strat egy (Feinman 2000:214, 217-218). Conversely, the lack of status markers (other than ear spools, which may have signified group identity,9 and a panpipe, which may have belonged to a shaman [Turff and Carr 2006]) and the lack of possible symbols of leadership such as copper plates and headdresses in Turner burials suggests that per sonal identity was disembedded from leadership roles, and that positions of status were not recog nized at death and were therefore not reproducible among the living. These patterns lend additional support to an interpretation of egalitarian behavior and a corporate cognitive code at the site. Use of Ceremonial Space. Although exotic materials and caches of craft items were not interred with the individuals buried at Turner, these items were not absent from the site. Rather, they were placed in prepared clay basins (the "altars" noted above). The confinement of caches of potential wealth items at Turner to clay basins is significant. These deposits appear to be com munal offerings, an interpretation strengthened by the fact that the two largest such deposits at Turner were placed in altars in the centers of the ceremonial structures that would become Mounds 3 and 4, and which were not associated with buri als. In fact, Mounds 3,4,5,7,9,12, and 14 inside the embankment all contained centrally placed altars with no associated burials. In some instances (e.g., Mound 5), the central altar had been cov ered and rebuilt multiple times (Figure 11). Mound 3 contained a human cremation in the stone mantle covering the mound, and mound 12 contained burials both within and beyond the inte rior mantle (Figure 12), but no mounds with cen tral altars had burials placed inside the main ceremonial space.10 In contrast, Mound 25 at Hopewell and the Seip Conjoined mound (Figure 13) contained burials and burial platforms clustered around clay basins. The Seip-Pricer mound (Figure 14) contained a clay basin adjacent to a central burial cluster in first section, and a group of burials with no central basin in the second section.11 The presence at these sites of clay basins as the foci of or as adjuncts to clus ters or groups of burials may indicate a level of rit ual control by descent groups or other social segments (consistent with an exclusionary orien tation) that is not evidenced at the Turner site, where the consistent central placement of clay basins within formally bounded ceremonial areas and the apparent proscription of burial within these same areas suggest an emphasis on community over the individual that is consistent with a corporate cog nitive code. Hilltop Enclosures Finally, I would like to suggest that hilltop enclo sures, the most common form of ceremonial cen ter in southwestern Ohio (Figure 1), also exhibit evidence of corporate strategies. These centers are bounded by sinuous embankments that enclose sacred spaces by following the natural contours of the hilltops on which they were built. Romain (1996,2004) has associated such sites with Under world symbolism, and the placement of these enclo sures on dissected hilltops away from floodplain habitation sites is consistent with the performance of dangerous world renewal rites (Mainfort and Sullivan 1998:12; Wright 1990), possibly includ ing the construction and maintenance of the enclo sures themselves. It is interesting in this light to note the use of vertical elevation in the raised circles at Turner and at the Milford enclosure in Clermont County, another geometric enclosure in south western Ohio (Byers 2004:486; Willoughby 1922). Whether or not one accepts an Underworld empha sis at hilltop enclosures, they do appear to reflect broad natural and cosmological themes consistent with a corporate emphasis in southwestern Ohio. At Fort Ancient (33WA2), a large hilltop enclo sure in Warren County, Ohio (Figures 1 and 15), most of the Middle Woodland period burials occur in concentrations of intermingled bones in a deposit inside of Gateway 5a in the South Fort and in a low mound near the same gateway (Connolly 2004; Moorehead 1890; Morgan 1970). These appear to</page><page sequence="19">Coon] VARIATION IN OHIO HOPEWELL POLITICAL ECONOMIES 67 _A^ x^S-^ r-i??T^^X / / W- X ::| S\ \ / %mp | BURNT %Wt% % \ \ I v"sr INTRUSIVE J .,., ?K7!S .'l1 I_, \ 1 / , w'"*, %? ??M? $ j I \ \ TRENCH """ ' / ^v^^^ supposed! w^u*V^-^--^^^^ B Figure 11.

The "overwhelming majority" (95 percent) of Middle Woodland period burials at the site are found in these communal ossuaries or in burials located outside of the enclo sure on the exterior terraces (Connolly 2004; Moorehead 1890; Morgan 1970). The external buri als suggest that mortuary activity may have been prohibited within the enclosure at some point, just as burial was prohibited within the small ceremo nial structures at Turner. When burials within the enclosure were considered acceptable, they reflected a corporate character. It should be noted that the mortuary program at Fort Ancient is unusual, as hilltop enclosures are not typically associated with burials or burial mounds. Only two other hilltop enclosures in the region offer solid evidence of bur ial mounds in their immediate proximity: Miami Fort (33HA24) in Hamilton County, Ohio, although this mound may predate the enclosure (Connolly 2004:47), and the Oberting enclosure (12D25) in Dearborn County, Indiana, with nine (eight exter nal and one internal) associated mounds (four still extant), none of which has ever been excavated (Black 1934; Cox 1879). While Fort Ancient does deviate from the suggested regional prohibition against mortuary ceremonialism and mound buri als associated with hilltop enclosures, it is signifi cant that it does so in a way that remains consistent with a corporate cognitive code.</page><page sequence="20">68 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 Figure 12. Plan view of Turner Mound 12 showing central clay basin and burials in and around the stone mantle (Willoughby 1922:Figure 41). There appear to be other indications of corpo rate behavior at Fort Ancient. Warren Moorehead, the first systematic excavator at the site, commented on his surprise and disappointment at the lack of "rich relics" in the mounds there (Moorehead 1890:55,1896), a condition which led him to aban don his investigations there in favor of the more materially rewarding Hopewell site. Moorehead noted that copper "has seldom been found in the inclosure [sic]," although "it is not uncommon" in nearby mounds, and that other exotic materials and craft items were also scarce or absent from the site (Moorehead 1890:61, 1896:375). A cache of cop per Hopewell craft items (such as breastplates, axes, and ear spools, all hammered out of shape), slate pendants, galena pieces, and mica sheets was later found outside of the embankment walls (Cowan et al. 2004; Mills 1900; Morgan 1970; Otto 2004), and another cache (the "Powell cache") containing bifaces, flakes, blocky chunks of obsidian, and blades made of quartz crystal was discovered in 1975 near the parallel embankments northeast of (but outside of) the main enclosure (Blosser and Glotzhober 1993; Cowan et al. 2004; Essenpreis and Moseley 1984:26). Other similar deposits may still exist outside of the enclosure, as quantities of bifaces made of Wyandotte/Harrison County blue grey chert (and possibly of Flint Ridge/Vanport</page><page sequence="21">Coon] VARIATION IN OHIO HOPEWELL POLITICAL ECONOMIES 69 A uoooooOjt g WJ ? S if 5m EH" Burial Platform o - Post Mold Figure 13. Reconstruction of the Seip-Conjoined floor plan, showing estimated locations of burial platforms and clay basin (from Greber 1979a:Figure 7). chert) and of crystal quartz have been found in the surrounding fields (Cowan et al. 2004:110-111; Moorehead 1890:56-57), but such objects remain scarce within, suggesting a prohibition against depositing potential status items within the enclo sure. Exotic materials, including obsidian and mica, have been found at sites near Fort Hill (33HI1) in Highland County, Ohio (Griffin 1965:119; Potter and Thomas 1970), but not at Fort Hill itself, sug gesting that although these materials were present in the area, there was a restriction against their use and deposition within that enclosure. As noted at Fort Ancient, this suggests the imposition of some sort of sumptuary rules regarding the enclosed space of the ceremonial center. Taken together, I believe that these sites reflect an emphasis on cor porate organizational strategies in southwestern Ohio that spans the Middle Woodland period. Chronology So far, I have not directly dealt with the dimension of time in my analysis of the variation in Ohio Hopewell political economies. This is true in part because a robust chronology has not been devel oped for Ohio Hopewell, despite several attempts at seriation and despite the accumulation of a sig nificant number of radiocarbon dates. This diffi culty stems in part from the fact that major Hopewell centers such as those discussed above are palimpsests of numerous activities that took place in various contexts over generations of use (Gre ber 1997,2003). As a result, while features within</page><page sequence="22">70 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 {-20m o Post-Molds Figure 14. The Seip-Pricer mound floor plan, showing locations of burial platforms and clay basins (from Shetrone and Greenman 1931). the sites may be radiometrically dated, the amount of separation between and overlap among dates and temporally diagnostic artifacts at the various centers does not allow the construction of a simple chronology of sites as wholes (Carr 2006). Never theless, sedations based upon ceramics (Prufer 1968), and architecture (DeBoer 1997), as well as a rank ordering of ear spool styles (Greber 2003; Ruhl 2006; Ruhl and Seeman 1998), demonstrate a general agreement, despite various discrepancies. There is some indication that activity at the Hopewell site began earlier than at Seip (and pre sumably the other tripartite enclosures), and that the Seip-Conjoined mound was in use after the Seip-Pricer mound (Carr 2006). Greber (2003) reports that southwestern Ohio radiocarbon dates in general seem to be slightly ear lier than those from south-central Ohio. Carbon dates from hilltop enclosures in southwestern Ohio show initial construction in the very early Middle Woodland period and continuing use through the period of Hopewell interaction. It appears that the expansion of Fort Ancient (Connolly 2004) and the construction of geometric earthworks such as Turner in southwestern Ohio occurred somewhat later in the Middle Woodland period, and the car bon dates from Turner show considerable overlap with both Hopewell and Seip (DeBoer 2004). It is likely that there was some pattern of sequential overlap among most of these sites in both areas, as various centers rose and fell from prominence. I do interpret some of the differences in the exclu sionary strategies that I have outlined between Hopewell and Seip as reflecting evolutionary changes over time. There is probably also tempo ral variation in the corporate strategies that domi nated in southwestern Ohio from the early construction of small hilltop enclosures through the later construction of geometric enclosures (Coon 2008). However, the apparent long-term tendency toward corporate strategies in southwestern Ohio, and the temporal overlap between those south western Ohio corporate strategies and the exclu sionary strategies in south-central Ohio, suggest that chronological variation alone cannot account for the differences between these areas. I therefore believe that the patterns I have outlined above do appear to reflect actual differences in social and political orientation between the two areas. Conclusions I have suggested, on the basis of multiple lines of evidence, that differences in Hopewellian social</page><page sequence="23">Coon] VARIATION IN OHIO HOPEWELL POLITICAL ECONOMIES 71 Figure 15. The Fort Ancient enclosure (from Squier and Davis 1998 [1848]:Plate VII). and political behavior can be identified between southwestern Ohio sites, such as Fort Ancient and Turner, and south-central sites, such as Hopewell and Seip. Specifically, I have contended that the southwestern Ohio populations pursued a more corporate political economy through much of the Middle Woodland period, while people at the south central sites engaged in more exclusionary politi cal strategies. My intention has not been to claim that their behaviors were completely exclusionary nor completely corporate. Indeed, while one strat egy or the other may dominate at a given time and place, both may be employed simultaneously to various ends, and "all societies contain elements of both" (Blanton et al. 1996b:66). Therefore, it is my hope that this analysis will not be seen as an attempt to construct a typology of corporate and exclu sionary Hopewell societies, but as a recognition of the variation in the behaviors of Hopewell peoples. I anticipate that a number of questions will have arisen from the above analysis. Many of these will take the form of, "Why are exotic trade items (or monumental architecture, or other 'traits') found both at more corporately oriented southwestern sites and more exclusionary south-central sites?" Regarding the presence of exotic trade items in southwestern Ohio, I wish to emphasize that a net work strategy is exclusionary only if it is monop</page><page sequence="24">72 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 olized as a source of social or political power or inequality (Blanton et al. 1996b:67). Individually or group-based trade networks have probably existed in many corporate systems, and the acqui sition of exotic items for consumption in ritual events may confer a measure of prestige or good social standing (without creating an imbalance of power) to the households or other social subsets who contribute them, while also serving the larger goal of affirming the well-being and collective pres tige of the group as a whole or vis-a-vis peer poli ties (Blanton and Taylor 1995:123). While material similarities between the two areas may be of inter est for various reasons, the artifacts and features themselves are less significant than the social and behavioral contexts in which they were employed, and so the important point is that very similar mate rials appear to have been employed to very differ ent ends in south-central and southwestern Ohio. These similarities and differences raise ques tions concerning the nature and timing of interac tion between southwestern and south-central Ohio Hopewell peoples, and the fairly remarkable fact that southwestern and south-central Ohio societies were apparently able to maintain very different political economic orientations, even while osten sibly engaged in centuries of interaction, is an issue that begs additional study. The social basis for adopting and maintaining more exclusionary or more corporate forms of political economy by soci eties in different parts of Ohio is not understood at this time, and I believe that this will be an impor tant avenue of inquiry. I hope that this analysis will aid Ohio Hopewell researchers in their continuing efforts to move beyond the impediments inherent in explanatory schemes in which increased cultural or political complexity is thrust upon bounded, internally homogeneous cultural entities as a byproduct of their risk mitigation efforts in the face of environmental uncertainties. I anticipate that future research exploring the social dynamics of change within and interactions among Ohio Hopewell societies will contribute new insights into the evolution of middle-range societies.

It would be a mistake to assume that hierarchy necessi tates an exclusionary power base or that corporate strategies imply a lack of hierarchy. Degree of hierarchy should, in fact, be considered an orthogonal axis to the corporate exclusionary continuum (Feinman 2000). For instance, hier archization in corporate societies may be a means of discouraging individuals from pursuing exclusionary power strategies (Blanton 1998). 2. In addition, Song (1991:162, 175, 210) found that sev eral yarn fragments from Seip contain both S-spun and Z spun cordage, but it is not clear whether this is the result of different kinds of bast fibers (which have natural predisposi tions to twist in opposite directions [Carr and Maslowski 1995:322-323; Song 1991:210]) being incorporated into</page><page sequence="28">76 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009] these yarns, or whether it may be result of cordage spun by multiple individuals having been incorporated into the same fabric. 3. Strong preferences for grave orientation along the car dinal and intercardinal directions are also seen at Seip (and probably at Hopewell as well), but no clear patterning is evi dent and these sites lack the strong spatial division displayed at Turner that suggests a moiety distinction. Similarly, Greber (1996; Greber and Ruhl 2001) has posited the presence of a dual ritual organization in south-central Ohio on the basis of complementary contrasts between paired ceremonial deposits, such as in Shetrone Mound 17 at the Hopewell site. However, such deposits are rare, and if their symbolic duality did reflect a dual social organization, it appears to have been subordinated to other social distinctions such as clan affilia tion, sodality membership (Carr 2006), and leadership roles. 4. Since the entire Turner Burial Place cemetery was not excavated, these individuals are a subset from a burial popu lation of unknown size, and so we do not know how accu rately these proportions reflect the total population. 5. A somewhat similar boat-shaped carving, made of slate and resembling a horned creature with a segmented tail or rat tle, was recovered from the Burnt Offering at Seip. This was described at one point in the report as being "an effigy of a lizard, or perhaps the pupa of an insect," but another textual reference and the caption under its illustration describe it as "probably representing the pupa of an insect" (Shetrone and Greenman 1931:378, 426-427, Figure 47). It was accompa nied by realistic bird effigies, modified and decorated animal bones and teeth, ear spools, pearl and copper beads, chert and obsidian blades, fabric, and other materials that do not sug gest any clear symbolic or thematic unity. Whether or not this artifact does represent a horned serpent or chimera, it appears to be unusual among Seip artifacts. 6. It has been suggested that two separate artifacts were mistakenly joined during the reconstruction, with the current "head" not originally belonging to the body! 7. There is some uncertainty as to the provenience of this engraving. The Field Museum catalog assigns it to Burial 260-261 (FMNH 56369), but Moorehead (1922:111) assigns it to Burial 278. The notes of Charles Willoughby indicate that it may have come from either context (Greber and Ruhl 2001:212). 8. Another masked figure may be portrayed on a bone recovered from the former Cincinnati earthworks (Shetrone 1930:137: Figure 77), although in that case the mask appears to show more mammalian traits, possibly canine or ursine. 9. Carr (2006) hypothesizes that ear spools are linked with sodality membership in the Scioto area, but it is not clear whether he extends that association to southwestern Ohio. 10. Marriott Mound 1, located outside of and directly west of the Turner enclosure (Figure 4), did contain four graves and an altar near its center, however. 11. However, one ceremonial deposit was placed in a depression in the floor, rather than in a clay basin, and another was placed in a tomb-like log enclosure.
