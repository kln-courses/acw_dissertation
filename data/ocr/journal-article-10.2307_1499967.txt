<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Language of Religious Experience and Its Implications for Fieldwork DIANE E. GOLDSTEIN Though the study of personal experience narrative has been very popular in recent years, a large and serious gap remains in the literature. This gap, hopefully, will be filled by writings attend- ing to the various factors which come to bear on the reduction of experience into narrative. Of particular importance is the applica- tion of ideas of communicative competence' beyond socially deter- mined skill and appropriateness to the personal level. I do not mean to imply here a return to Chomsky's ideal speaker.2 Rather, I refer to the need to be aware of reports of experience as a genre, involving in part a hidden dialogue between the narrator and him- self, concerning the transformation of an event into language. Although this paper will address specifically religious and mysti- cal experience narratives, we should note that language, even out- side of the realm of religion or the paranormal, is never fully ade- quate to express experience. We are constantly forced to reduce the strength of our feeling to a few inadequate words if we are to communicate important events. Anyone who has tried to com- municate his or her most profound aesthetic moments, such as This paper was presented at the American Folklore Society Meeting in Minneapolis, Minn., on 15 October 1982. I am indebted to Amanda McQuiddy, David Hufford, Kenneth S. Goldstein, Dell Hymes, and Don Yoder for their help and encouragement. 1.

What we resort to is what C. S. Lewis calls "transposition.'"3 When we draw what we see, we take our three-dimensional reality and put it into a two-dimensional sketch. This is an example of transposition. By transposing our experiences, we take the richer emotional sensation and represent it in a poorer verbal report. In religious experience, difficulty in verbalization may occur not only because of the intensity of feeling but because of the "otherness" of such experiences. There appear to be two senses in which this is true. First, our language refers to this reality, to the physical world of tables and chairs or to the abstract world of cognition; religious experience may refer to another world, a separate reality which does not have referential likenesses to the physical or abstract aspects of this world. Second, our language works as a communication device because of the very fact that we share common experiences. This is not to imply that we all experience things in the same way but that we have conceptual categories which allow us to understand each other. When I speak of an abstract concept such as pain, although the pain which I have felt in my life is bound to be different from the pain felt by the person to whom I am speaking, we have an understanding of the conceptual category of "pain." If a person speaks of "sens- ing the presence of God," however, conceptual categories may be less helpful due to a lack of any type of direct experience to which one might relate the description. Crucial to an understanding of mystical groups is the acknowl- edgment that their members feel they have experienced a religious or mystical reality. The ethnographer cannot start with the ques- tion of the existence or non-existence of such phenomena. For the subject who is a believer, the experience is real, and it is the reality of this experience and its relation to folkloric tradition which must become the focus. Once we bracket the question of the ontological status of such experiences, we might then move on to how this reality is expressed by our informants. The issues addressed in this paper are based on observations drawn from fieldwork conducted in 1981 by Amanda McQuiddy 3.

Information cited here was collected in a variety of settings including services, formal inter- views, parties, discussion groups, and classes sponsored by con- gregation members. The Church of Ageless Wisdom was founded in 1927 and is the only metaphysical church represented in the National Council of Churches. Its congregation, numbering about 150 members in the Philadelphia chapter,4 is comprised largely of psychics and healers. Members remain devout participants in the Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish faiths, as well as Spiritual- ists, Agnostics, and devotees of the Eastern philosophies. The chap- ter is completely integrated racially and has representatives of vir- tually every age group. The Church of Ageless Wisdom exists for the very reasons which are under discussion here. Although many of the members' experiences are very different, they have a common understanding of the mystical world; they have developed shared conceptual categories. The goal of the Church is to provide a forum for the discussion of religious and mystical experience. For this reason, although there is a minister, the Church is essentially run by its congregation. All interactions in the Church point to the compe- tent speaker as one who is able to express the nature of his or her own religious or mystical experience in a way which will allow others to share insights derived from those experiences. By exam- ining patterns in language present in personal experience narra- tives and other verbal genres, it is possible to see how such compe- tence is achieved. My focus here is on speech strategies used in these reports which build from common understandings to the personal religious experience. The vital role played by the metaphor in the communication of ideas which are difficult to explain has been discussed by many scholars. The metaphor, according to Brenda Beck, "borrows a part of one context, by identifying the abstract form, and applies it to another group of things that is less easily understood."5 4. The Church of Ageless Wisdom has seventeen chapters throughout the United States, England, and India. The Philadelphia chapter is the original Church and was established in 1927. Statements in this paper concern only the Philadelphia chapter and should not be extended to the Church as a whole. 5.

From the start of our visits to the Church, Amanda and I no- ticed a particularly Christian ring to the statements made during the services. Christ was mentioned often despite the professed ecumenical nature of the Church. After each service several con- gregation members would mention in passing (and unelicited), "You know that it's not Christ the Man that they're referring to." We attended the Church for almost a month before we realized that the words spoken about "Christ" were not actually about Jesus Christ but rather concerned what might be referred to as "Christ consciousness." This, for the members of the Church, was the consciousness of God, present in all of the major spiritual teachers: Christ, Buddha, Krishna, etc. Christ was a metaphor, as the man in which this consciousness was manifest. This is not to say that no mention is ever made of "Christ the Man" but rather that the metaphorical meaning is prevalent. Non-metaphor- ical references to "Christ the Man" are almost always marked by the use of the name "Jesus" or "Jesus Christ," as in the fol- lowing quote: I am reminded of a story I heard long ago when I was a child of a man that they called Jesus Christ. Contextual references to scripture or other things associated with Jesus seem to be sufficiently telling to require no further marker. Such as: Didn't Christ say, "Know me and know my Father"? And didn't he also say, "You can do greater things than me"? Metaphorical uses are generally marked by a placement of "the" in front of "Christ," removing the personal connotation, as in the original title "the Christ." For instance: You should be able to feel within yourself the Christ of your being. Or: And I could feel the energy of the Christ flowing into my body.</page><page sequence="5">THE LANGUAGE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 109 Although the use of a term which might be misinterpreted by visitors seems potentially problematic, the Church members have chosen a term which easily conjures up the image they intend. As David Hufford has noted: Where tradition has supplied a term to refer to the experience, the term has developed a larger sphere of meaning. This is quite natural since phenomenological description is not a natural purpose in everyday speech.6 Very much like metaphor and conceptually hard to differentiate is analogy. The metaphor juxtaposes elements of a concrete image in order to formulate a set of more abstract relationships.' The metaphor implies likeness, but the comparison is not explicit.8 The analogy is a fuller comparison, showing or implying several points of similarity.9 Theologians have often noted that attributes ascribed to God must be taken analogically to avoid the danger of making an anthropomorphic statement.10 Thus, God loves, but this love is not the sort of thing we mean when we say man loves. A similar difficulty arises for the mystic in ascribing this-worldly attributes to mystical reality. The analogy grabs onto the closest this-worldly properties and assumes an understanding of the difference. Thus, concurrently, identity and difference are assigned. The most important example of the use of analogy in the Church is the reference to "healing light," "the white light," or "the light of God." For example: Picture these people in your mind and allow this beautiful light that radiates from you to encompass them, so that they too may share the beautiful joy and love that's in your heart, so that they too may be healed. 6.

It is a prop- erty but not the whole of that property. It is not completely light as we know it, nor is it the only manifestation of that energy. The healing energy is pictured as light, so that it may be tangibly used-but it is more than light. Light, more than any other verbal characterization is used to attribute a concept to the mystical world; light is a manifestation of healing energy, spirit guides are surrounded by light, and in meditation one goes "into the light." The use of negative modifiers or hyperbolic modifiers is a com- mon strategy in the Church for attributing experience to some- thing which is this-worldly, yet cautioning listeners to the differ- ence. The hyperbolic modifier appears as "super-something," as in: We contemplate in exaltation the guidance of the masters and the super-inspiration flowing from the spiritual realm. The negative modifier appears as "not" or "non-something," as in: I saw him there, and he was not-dream like, but yet he wasn't quite like us either. He touched me, and I felt a super-kind of calm come over me. These modifiers are in a certain sense more important than the phrase-they determine the difference between this world and the mystic's experience. In thinking about problems in voicing mystical experiences, the question must arise-What about standard occult terminology? Members of the Church of Ageless Wisdom make a concentrated effort to avoid using occult terms for two important reasons. First, members are extremely conscious of social attitudes toward mystics and therefore shun stereotyped language. Second, members feel that standard occult terms are not indicative of their experiences. I have seen this illustrated many times by congregation members</page><page sequence="7">THE LANGUAGE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 111 in joking behavior very much like "playing whiteman,"" although in this case they are "playing occult." At a party held by one of the members, the following exchange occurred: Ruth: Has anyone seen John lately? I've been wondering about him. Isabel: Yes, as a matter of fact I have. I was out astral traveling the other night and I flew past him. In fact I nearly knocked him over. He's just fine. This exchange was followed by great laughter. Although Isabel was speaking directly to another mystic, the number of non- mystics at the party caused a little extra exaggeration. Her com- ments, "I flew past him" and "I almost knocked him over," made it clear to all present that she was joking. The term "astral travel- ing," however, is seen by this group to be as far from their actual experiences as is the notion of "flying" or "knocking someone over" within this context. What does all this mean for fieldwork? Clearly, an emphasis on the transposition of experience into a verbal report raises new issues in folklore fieldwork. If we return to our earlier example of transposition as it applies to drawing, it is clear that a reduction has occurred between the perceived three-dimensional reality and the two-dimensional sketch. Such reduction does not bother us, because we know the reality which the sketch represents, and we know that it communicates the higher reality to those who view it. Suppose, however, viewers did not know this reality. They would not know that the two-dimensional lines were simply a reduction. Here, I recall a cousin of mine who was color blind. For him, colors were transposed into shades of grey. As a child, I wondered how he managed in a world of black, grey, and white. Yet, he had never seen colors and thus did not know the "richer" reality. He was aware, however, of the reduction since he knew that such a thing existed. As fieldworkers who, in many cases, have not had the types of experiences which our informants have had, we are often like my cousin, without direct knowledge of the reality. What I call for here, though, is that we become aware of the reduction. In order to understand our informants we must come 11. Keith H. Basso, Portrait of "The Whiteman" (Cambridge, 1979).</page><page sequence="8">112 WESTERN FOLKLORE to terms with this difference between experience and reports of experience. It would appear that metaphors, analogies, and negative or hyperbolic modifiers allow our informants a way to express experi- ences which are hard to convey. If we can observe these speech strategies as aids used by our informants, it should also be possible for the fieldworker to use such strategies to assist his or her infor- mants in description. We can suggest the tools for the formation of such statements by asking questions designed to encourage our informants to build from common understandings to their personal experiences. These questions might be: "Have you ever had a feeling like that before?" or "Given any materials you need to produce the way that appeared, what would you use?" or even simply, "Was it like such and such?" Once we feel we have obtained the information which is available through regular inter- view methods, we should not hesitate to try to help our informants express their experiences. Perhaps our search for scientific method, and our fear of leading our informants, has caused us to ignore a way in which we may assist our informants in giving full, rich descriptions. Perhaps their own need to express their experiences makes irrelevant the question of leading in this context. In any case the potential for distortion and reductionism in the expression of religious experience has important implications for fieldwork and interpretation. Clearly, a literal interpretation of a metaphorical statement could be ethnographically disastrous. The analogy, if interpreted literally or metaphorically minimizes our opportunities for our understanding of descriptive properties. Fur- ther, as is the case with "healing light," our potential to grasp a tangible property of our informant's experience may be lost. Negative and hyperbolic modifiers, thought to be colloquial and edited out (even if only in our thinking), radically change our informant's statements. For the folklorist working on belief, the issue of the pressures felt by our informants in the translation of experience to narrative is central to understanding the different levels of description. It is our job, as fieldworkers, to understand those pressures and learn the language our informants are speak- ing. Otherwise, we are as much at a loss as if we had chosen to do fieldwork in a country whose language we do not speak. With- out an understanding of what may be considered literal and what</page><page sequence="9">THE LANGUAGE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 113 is a strategy constructed for the expression of experience, we cannot hope to comprehend religious experience narratives. It is only in the observation of language pattern that we may achieve that understanding. University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</page></plain_text>
