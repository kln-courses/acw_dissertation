<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mark Foster Gage and Florencia Pita The Zero Degree Of Ideology Since Leon Battista Albertus theoretical overturning of Yitruvius's Ten Books of Architecture with his own, architecture has found itself broadcasting ever- changing alibis that define it as either an artistic practice, the result of philosophical or political theory, or the product of measurable scientific data. This latter tendency is currently enjoying a resurgence in the profession as new courtships between program, technology, and sustainability emerge, but it aims toward no ultimate scientific truth, no penultimate discovery, and no unifying theory for or against which its practitioners might continu- ally drive. Instead, architectural developments today, even the scientifically biased ones, tend to be somewhat looser affairs, relying on day-to-day technological opportunities and lucky discoveries of yet-unclaimed material palettes, programmatic arrangements, or digital processes. This loose- ness opens architecture to the influence of manufacturing techniques, natural metaphors, personal relationships, and an endless stream of seemingly weak forces. This susceptibility to influence, however, is actually a great strength, allowing architecture to swim through the manifold currents of con- temporary culture - emerging with new opportunities that enable the testing, adopting, and reforming of new formal and conceptual horizons. In the absence of broad consensus, but bound by related interests in the specifics of these influences, smaller groups of architects converse casually, although rarely converge to tackle the intractable, much less produce anything as pass√© as a manifesto. Instead, a system of ad hoc dialogues has formed. Ironically, architectural dialogue has perhaps never been quite so much fun - or so informal - showing up in Blackberry'd texts, over cheap post- symposium Chardonnay, and at jury junkets to far off academies, where one feels spe- cial, even exotic - in part for meeting at all. But this relaxed form of dialogue comes with a price. In the absence of the articulated ideologies of yesteryear, or even their fruitful "oppositions," we are left with neither a collective consensus nor any prescriptive direction as to how architecture might proceed. If anything, it is clear that in a seemingly ideology- free architectural world, we no longer have an obvious vehicle 7</page><page sequence="2">Mark Foster Gage is an assistant PROFESSOR AND ACTING ASSISTANT DEAN AT THE YALE SCHOOL OF Architecture and founder of Gage / Clemenceau Architects in New York City.

This does not mean that meta- themes are not somehow in play, only that the diversity and volume of our group discourses make any larger theme diffi- cult to detect above the somewhat productive din of our atomized chatter. If the unpardonable security tactics of the post-9/11 world have taught us anything, it is that the surveillance of seemingly trivial chatter frequently yields more significant bodies of information. It is in this spirit that we made Log 17, codenamed "The Superficial Issue," not as a validation of the thoughtless, but as an opportunity to imagine what common undiscovered territory might reside in the surveillance of our own casual chatter. We invited a diverse group of con- tributors to offer thoughts on the seemingly most insignifi- cant of architectural modalities and the apparently most superficial of topics via purposefully far-reaching analogies to past and present forms of insurrection in disparate disci- plines, thereby inviting a broader speculation on the current state of architectural affairs. In the absence of a manifesto, we posit that any larger picture, if it is to exist at all, must arise from a collective of smaller and somehow tangentially related interests. The method of shaping this issue was largely intuitive - factoring in the presence of multiple discussions dancing around a topic dense with recurring thematic notes on aesthetics, affect, effect, sensation, beauty, and other forms of sensory or emotive experience. We believe that something hazy, unformed, and not-quite recognizable, yet certainly alive has crept out of the dark, abstract forests of intellection, process, and criticism to seek new forms of engagement in architecture through the non-verbal and sensate. This does not preclude thought, but rather introduces, in rehearsals of similar historic observations by Immanuel Kant, Conrad Fiedler, and Ortega y Gasset, the idea that the sensations associated with aesthetic experience are largely independent of active intellection, and that the relationship between us and our architecture can be more than only linguistically and intellectually based. Such a shift anticipates a conjoining of Renaissance anthropomorphism with Modernism's rote mechanical-cum-political equalities into a newly rescaled version of the Copernican principle, where, in the world of human sensations, there simply are no privileged viewers. 8</page></plain_text>
