<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONCEPT OF MYTH AND THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOCULTURAL EVOLUTION1 By DAVID BIDNEY CULTURAL evolutionists speak as if there were a mythopoeic or myth- making stage of human thought in which primitive peoples have been living for untold ages. There is general agreement among ethnologists that myths deal with a supersensuous, preternatural or "supernatural" sphere of reality and refer to some prehistoric time. On this assumption myths have been defined as "stories of anonymous origin, prevalent among primitive peoples and by them accepted as true, concerning supernatural beings and events, or natural beings and events influenced by supernatural agencies."2 According to Tylor, "First and foremost among the causes which trans- figure into myths the facts of daily experience, is the belief in the animation of all nature rising at its highest pitch to personification."3 Tylor, however, explicitly recognized the relativity of myth to one's criterion of possibility and noted that "The ordinary standards of possibility, as applied to the credi- bility of tradition, have indeed changed vastly in the course of culture through its savage, barbaric and civilized stages."4 He drew attention to the fact that the doctrine of miracles commonly accepted in the Middle Ages became, as it were, a bridge along which mythology travelled from the lower into the higher culture. "Principles of myth-formation, belonging properly to the mental state of the savage, were by its aid continued in strong action in the civilized world."5 The real mainspring of myth in all ages, Tylor maintained, has been the "pragmatizer," who, through his incapacity to hold abstract ideas, is forced to embody them in material incidents and to clothe every thought in concrete shape.6 He believed, however, that the growth of myth had been checked by science and that myth was, therefore, to be considered as primitive ethnology expressed in poetic form. 7 Similarly Wundt,8 following Vico, maintained that there has been an evo- lution of myth corresponding to the main stages of cultural development. Parallel to the Totemic Age he postulates the m~irchen-myth, a narrative resembling the fairy tale, which centers about magical agencies, demons and gods. In the following Heroic Age, myths arise which deal with the exploits of culture heroes, who, though aided by magic and supernatural agencies, are SA briefer version of this paper was read at the XXIX International Congress of American- ists held in New York, September 5-12, 1949.

Theogonic and cosmogonic myths are also held to be characteristic of this period. Finally, in the age of reason and Development to Humanity, man is said to attain a large measure of rational, critical thought and a cosmopolitan perspective which enables him to transcend the limitations of the mythical mentality. Susanne K. Langer has struck a new note in putting forward a theory of the emergence of myth as a distinct category of primitive thought. Unlike the evolutionary ethnologists, and in contrast to philosophers such as Cassirer, she does not assume that primitive thought is mythological, but maintains that mythological thought is itself the product of an evolutionary process of development. According to Langer's Philosophy in a New Key,9 myth begins in fantasy, and to this extent shares a common origin with dreams and the dream-narra- tive. As the dream-narrative is recounted, it undergoes various modifications in the interests of coherence and public appeal. As a result, higher fictional modes of story emerge, namely, the animal fable, the trickster story and the ghost story, and these develop into the fairy tale. The fairy tale, in turn, is motivated by wishful thinking, and reflects the cultural frustrations of a given society. It is perennially attractive, yet never quite believed by adults even in the telling. The myth, according to Langer, is not to be understood as a development of the fairy tale or Volksm~irchen, as Wundt and other German scholars have suggested, but rather as something newly emerging which involves a "thematic shift" in function. Myth is said to be motivated, not by subjective, wishful thinking, but rather by the quest for an understanding of the significance of nature and life. Hence, unlike fairy tales, myths are taken with "religious seriousness" either as historic fact or as mystic truth. The typical theme of myth is tragic, not utopian, and its characters tend to become stable personali- ties of a supernatural order. Thus, although both myth and fairy tale are said to originate in fantasy and to involve the identification of a mental symbol with the object to which it refers, the functions of the two differ radically. Whereas fairy tales are held to be the expression of wishful thinking and per- sonal gratification, myth, at its best, is to be regarded as a recognition of the drama of human existence. Its ultimate aint is not the wishful distortion of the world, but rather serious comprehension and envisagement of its funda- mental nature. Myth is regarded as representing metaphorically a world- picture and insight into life generally and may, therefore, be considered as primitive philosophy or metaphysical thought. As Langer reconstructs the evolution of human thought, the legend which produces the culture-hero constitutes an intermediate link between the fairy tale and the full-fledged nature-myth. The culture-hero narrative represents * Langer, 1948, p. 139.</page><page sequence="3">18 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [52, 1950 a transitional stage between the egocentric interest of the folk tale and the objective, universal interest of the nature-myth. The culture-hero may be in- terpreted as "man, overcoming the superior forces that threaten him." Man thus becomes a hero among his gods. "The highest development of which myth is capable is the exhibition of human life and cosmic order that epic poetry reveals."'1 When man begins to abstract his concepts and to examine them critically, when he inquires into the literal truth of a myth, then myth becomes superseded by discursive philosophy and science. Religion, like myth, is said to rest on a provisional mode of thought which is inevitably succeeded by science and a philosophy of nature. Myth and religion are provisional, poetic products of the creative imagination when confronted with the mysteries of nature and life. In this sense they may be regarded as recurrent phenomena of historical experience. The problem of the evolution of myth thus involves two distinct issues. First, there is the question whether all primitive thought is to be identified with the so-called mythopoeic or "prelogical" mentality, or whether myth constitutes but one phase or element of primitive thought. Second, there is the issue whether mythical thought itself is subject to a process of evolution, or whether it is a passing or provisional mode of thinking characteristic of the primitive mind only. On the whole, classical cultural evolutionists have taken the position that primitive thought is to be identified with mythological thought. As against this position, non-evolutionists, such as Boas and Malinowski, have main- tained that historical, primitive cultures as we know tham, provide no ground for holding to this thesis. Whether or not primitive, pre-historical man had a mythopoeic mentality and constantly mistook mental symbols and images for the objects of reality is something we can only conjecture, since we have no evidence on the subject. But historical men, as represented by our culturally primitive contemporaries, do distinguish clearly between fictional folk tales, historical legends and supersensuous, cosmogonic and theogonic narratives as well as between practical, empirical experience and magical arts. There is no basis, according to these students, for assuming that the pre-critical, irrational narratives which we designate as myths, but which nonliterate man holds as historical truth or sacred traditioh, are an outgrowth of some more elementary mode of mythical thought, such as the mundane folk tales. From the per- spective of the natives themselves, there is no doubt that the narratives we regard as myth do involve a "thematic shift," and that their function in native thought and culture differs essentially from that of the fictional tales told for entertainment. As to the problem whether mythological thought itself is subject to evo- lutionary development, or whether it is a passing phase of primitive thought 10o Ibid., pp. 163-164.</page><page sequence="4">BIDNEY] CONCEPT OF MYTH AND PSYCHOCULTURAL EVOLUTION 19 only, here too we find considerable disagreement. The cultural evolutionists were inclined to hold that mythological thought itself was subject to evolu- tionary development and that the character of myth varied with the cultural standard of credibility, as in the case of Tylor, or with the mode of sociopo- litical organization, as in Wundt. They tended to assume, however, that with the growth and dissemination of science, mythical thought was bound to dis- appear for the most part. As against this position, Malinowski" maintained that myth, like religion, fills a universal human need and is therefore indispen- sable to human culture at all stages of development. Myth, he contends, is to be understood as a post-scientific mode of thought, as supplementing scientific thought by rationalization and wishful thinking, or by what William James has called "the will to believe" in the face of recurrent crises all men must face, such as death. With the growth of scientific thought, he realizes, the sphere of mythological extrapolation becomes restricted, especially as regards myths of magic. But myth remains as a vital influence in civilized life, closely allied with religious faith. The function of myth is thus held to be one of validating or justifying cultural beliefs and practices, rather than one of explaining the causes of natural phenomena. It is of interest to note in this connection that Boas found considerable difficulty in defining the scope of myth. "It is fairly clear," he states, "that stories are unhesitatingly classed as myth if they account for the origin of the world and if they may be said to have happened in a mythical period, different from the one in which we live now. The difference is clearly recognized by many tribes, like the North American Indians, the Andaman Islanders, and the Australians."'12 A problem arises, however, when one attempts to distin- guish between myths and folk tales, since the same tales or plots appear in both. Boas attempted, therefore, to define "mythological concepts" while by- passing the difficult question of the classification of myths and folk tales. Thus he explains: Definition of mythological concepts is much easier than definition of mythological tales. Mythological concepts are the fundamental views of the constitution of the world and of its origin. These enter into tales relating to incidents in the lives of mythical beings, and into folk tales referring to the exploits and sufferings of our contemporaries, often of known individuals. Thus the African tells of encounters with ancestral ghosts and of the misdeeds of witches; the Koryak shaman recounts his fights with evil spirits; the European relates the incidents of the lives of the saints and dealings with the devil; the Oriental listens to stories of demons controlled by magic rings, and the American Indian to visits to the land of ghosts. In all these legends the mythological concepts appear as part and parcel of the tales.'3 n Malinowski, 1948. 'S Boas, 1944, pp. 609-610. a Ibid., p. 609.</page><page sequence="5">20 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [52, 1950 Boas does not explain why fundamental views of the constitution of the world are said to be mythological, but we may infer, since he cites Wundt in a footnote, that it is because such concepts are supersensuous or metaphysical. By contrast, folk tales are said to deal almost throughout "with events that may occur in human society, with human passions, virtues and vices." The most important characteristic of mythological concepts is said to be personification (a point Tylor had made), yet tales involving personified ani- mals are sometimes regarded as folk tales when the natives themselves do not take such stories seriously and recount them merely for entertainment. Tales dealing with the personification of natural phenomena, such as the sun and moon, are, on the other hand, evaluated by Boas as myths. In other words, while all mythological concepts are personifications either of animals or of natural phenomena, not all tales involving mythological concepts are myths. According to Boas, the only tales that are clearly mythological are those con- cerned with the personification of natural phenomena and referring to some prehistoric epoch. Folk tales, on the other hand, are to be considered as anal- ogous to modern fiction or novelistic literature. "The free play of imagination operating with everyday experience is sufficient to account for their origin." Thus folk tales may utilize mythological concepts without themselves being regarded or interpreted as myths. Psychologically, and from the perspective of the adherents of a given cul- ture, the difference between mythical tales and folk tales lies in the fact that the former are taken seriously while the latter are not. As Boas puts it: It would not be fair to assume that the myths dealing with the origin of the world or of the gift of arts and ceremonials to mankind were the result of a light play of imagination, as we suppose the rather insignificant animal tales to have been. The im- portance of the subject matter and the seriousness with which they are treated suggest that they are the result of thought about the origin of the world and of wonder about cultural achievements and the meaning of sacred rites. The only causality known in an anthropomorphic world is the one prevailing in human society, and thus it comes about that the incidents of human life that result in achievements are transferred to the mythical beings.'4 Boas, unlike Malinowski, grants that myths have an explanatory function and are motivated in part by wonder and intellectual reflection. Myths are said to be taken seriously in the sense that they deal with subjects of the ut- most importance to native life and constitute primitive man's beliefs as to the nature and origin of his world and the cosmic significance of his rites and customs. Boas distinguishes sharply between the novelistic, fictional folk tale and the explanatory myth with which it happens to be associated. The relation between the folk tale or novelistic plot, on the one hand, and the explanatory, mythological interpretation attached to it, on the other, is said to be "very 14 Ibid., p. 616.</page><page sequence="6">BIDNEY] CONCEPT OF MYTH AND PSYCHOCULTURAL EVOLUTION 21 loose." The same tale often appears associated with a great variety of ex- planatory myths, and this would seem to indicate that the folk story has an independent existence, and is prior to the mythological, explanatory after- thoughts suggested by its contents. Similarly Boas distinguishes between rites or customs and the mythical interpretations associated with them. "The uniformity of many such rituals over large areas," he points out, "and the diversity of mythological explana- tions shows clearly that the ritual itself is the stimulus for the formation of the myth .. . The ritual existed, and the tale originated from the desire to account for it.'"15 Just as the novelistic folk story or plot is held to be prior in time to the mythological interpretation associated with it, so rituals are thought to be prior to the variable, cultural myths which validate their origin and significance. From this it would appear that, according to Boas, empirical, practical rites, customs and folk tales preceded mythological interpretation and ex- planation. Mythological concepts and narratives are, so to speak, rationaliza- tions introduced after folk tales, rites and cultural arts had been invented and diffused. In this respect, Boas' view may be understood as the antithesis of the classical evolutionary approach of Tylor and Wundt, both of whom presupposed that mythological thought preceded, or was associated with, empirical concepts from the beginning. Boas assumes implicitly that primitive man clearly distinguishes between fictional, imaginary folk tales, and empirical concepts, on the one hand, and supersensuous, metaphysical concepts and tales on the other. He is then left with the difficult problem of explaining how the novelistic plot became associated with a mythological interpretation. "The investigation of the reason for this association," he admits, "is an attractive problem, the solution of which can only in part be surmised."'" Boas' dilemma may be summarized somewhat as follows: Though all attempts to differentiate between myths and folk tales on the basis of subject matter are bound to fail, since similar supersensuous, metaphysical concepts enter into both, yet cultural rituals and novelistic folk stories are said to pre- cede the various mythological narratives with which they become associated. Myths, that is, are said to be rationalizations or after-thoughts attached to rituals and folk tales. On this assumption, there would appear to be a clear, scientific basis for distinguishing myths from folk tales,-a thesis later de- veloped by Malinowski. But if the association between empirical rituals and folk tales on the one hand, and myths on the other, is secondary, then the prob- lem remains how they ever became associated in the first place. As Boas him- self acknowledges, "The essential problem regarding the ultimate origin of mythologies remains -why human tales are preferably attached to animals, celestial bodies, and other personified phenomena of nature."'7 Furthermore, 16 Ibid., p. 617. 16 Boas, 1938, p. 242. 17 Boas, 1915, p. 349.</page><page sequence="7">22 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [52, 1950 once it is granted that mythological concepts "enter into" folk tales, the prob- lem whether folk tales precede myths or vice versa becomes meaningless. From the perspective of the psychocultural approach advanced here, Boas' objection that the same tale could not be classed at one time as a myth and another time as a folk tale is not insurmountable. Since the object of myth, as Tylor noted, varies with the social standard of possibility, it follows that a given tale may at one time be classed as myth, and at another as a folk tale, depending upon the degree of credence attached to it by a given society. Lowie, in particular, has noteds18 that folk tales are sometimes utilized for pur- poses of etiological rationalization of rites, and that priestly adaptation may convert fiction into sacred myth. Conversely, in the process of time, myths can become folk tales, which may then be refashioned by the creative artist into great literature having lasting symbolic value for subsequent generations, e.g. Goethe's Faust, Cervantes' Don Quixote and Melville's Moby Dick. Boas himself has noted that folk tales are taken lightly by their originators while myths are taken seriously, but interpreted this psychological observa- tion in a static, fixed sense rather than from a changing, relativistic psycho- cultural perspective. Tales are not taken seriously by natives because they are myths; they are evaluated by us as myths because they are, or were, taken seriously by those who recount them. It is not only the nature of the meta- physical concepts involved or the distance of the prehistoric space-time in which the events narrated occurred, which determines whether or not a given tale is to be regarded as a myth; it is rather the psychocultural attitude or degree of belief of those who recount them. Thus the accepted belief or sub- jective truth of one epoch may become myth for the next. In all instances, it is the psychocultural context, rather than the subject matter, which determines how a given narrative is to be classified. According to our thesis, the term "belief" is an epistemically neutral term in the sense of being beyond truth and falsity. To say that one believes a given statement tells us nothing of its scientific or objective validity, that is, whether the given statement is in accordance with empirically established facts. But myth is not a scientifically neutral term; on the contrary, it is a value-charged term and implies a negative evaluation as regards the validity of a given nar- rative. Myth, in other words, is correlative to belief and implies a priori that the narrative or explanation described as mythological is not true or credible. It is important to note, furthermore, that a myth is evaluated as such only from the perspective of those who do not share the ideas and beliefs under con- sideration. From the perspective of those who accept the ideas and beliefs as true or valid, the latter are not myths at all. What we may regard as "myths" is Lowie, 1948.</page><page sequence="8">BIDNEY] CONCEPT OF MYTH AND PSYCHOCULTURAL EVOLUTION 23 are, psychologically, charters of belief or sacred traditions for those who accept them and live by them. Belief is essential to the acceptance of myth, and ac- counts for its effectiveness in a given cultural context, but the very fact of belief implies that subjectively, that is, for the believer, the object of belief is not mythological. Hence non-belief in a given narrative, tradition or explana- tion is essential for its evaluation as myth, just as belief in its truth and validity is essential for its acceptance as an effective element of culture. In this way, the distinction between belief, myth and truth is retained, while the relativity of myth to belief and an accepted cultural standard of credibility is recognized. We must distinguish, furthermore, between myth and superstition. Myth involves a belief of a special kind, namely, an incredible belief or the idea of a credible impossibility. A superstition, on the other hand, is a mode of fear based on some irrational or mythological belief and usually involves some taboo in practice. Myths may give rise to superstitions and the latter may stimulate the invention of myths. Superstitions may, however, arise from any irrational association of ideas, whether metaphysical or empirical, such as the notion of a black cat as an omen of bad luck, and hence do not necessarily arise from mythical narratives or notions of the supernatural. Furthermore, since a super- stition is essentially an irrational fear, it is to be distinguished from pre-critical folk beliefs in general, some of which may comprise elements of empirical knowledge. Some recent works19 on "superstitions" apparently do not make this distinction. Since belief may be objectively either true or false, it follows that what a given individual regards as myth may reflect his own unbelief rather than ob- jective truth, just as his subjective "truth" may be objective myth. In this sense myth is a function of cultural belief and unbelief. Contemporary political propaganda and the "cold war" between the East and the West provide many instances of this relativistic interpretation of myth. Objectively and normatively, however, myth is relative to scientific knowl- edge, and to this extent myth may be described as belief, usually expressed in narrative form, that is incompatible with scientific knowledge. Insofar as scientific knowledge is verifiable and potentially universal, the category of myth may be said to refer, by comparison, to notions and narratives which, though once accepted and believed, are no longer worthy of rational credence. Theories of disease prevalent in primitive cultures, for example, which explain disease as due to evil spirits, are mythological because they are incompatible with scientific medicine; and not merely because they are not believed by particular members of our society. This explains why so many scientists and philosophers belittle and regret myth-making, although they recognize its great influence in sociocultural life. Insofar as it is acknowledged that there is a normative body of well-authen- 19 De Lys, 1948.</page><page sequence="9">24 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [52, 1950 ticated truth, and that human reason is capable of distinguishing truth from falsity and fiction, so far will responsible and mature minds prefer objective truth and well-founded faith to fictions and myths, regardless of the latter's so-called pragmatic value. To regard myth as a neutral term beyond truth and falsity, and to interpret the culture of scientific rationalism as if it also were based on myth, is to undermine the very basis of rational and scientific thought. From this perspective, the greatest myth of the twentieth century is the identification of all cultural ideology with myth in the name of social science.20 For this our modern social scientists have much to answer. The relativity of myth to scientific and philosophic knowledge as well as to belief in general, renders intelligible the continuous change in the evaluation of a particular myth or mythological system to be found at different periods of culture history. The firm faith of one generation becomes the myth of the next. Thus the Greek folk deities and religious traditions have become the myths of the classical scholars. Where belief is not guided by critical, self- correcting, scientific intelligence, the fortunes of a given myth vary from time to time and culture to culture, depending upon the changing psychocultural orientation of the society concerned. Thus it may happen that what one society regards as mere fable or legend unworthy of credence may become the accepted faith or dogma of another. In the process of historical acculturation, it may be shown, many primitive, religious traditions have become folk tales, while the folk tales of one culture have often been used to rationalize or vali- date the ritual and custom of another. It should be noted in this connection that, while all myths may be evalu- ated as incredible beliefs, there are, nevertheless, disparate degrees of truths in diverse types of myth. The great myths are those to which we moderns ascribe an implicit or latent symbolic truth-value which may never have been in- tended by their originators. Thus, although the narrative of Genesis concern- ing Adam and Eve and the forbidden fruit is regarded nowadays by critical scholars as mythological, it still continues to have for them significant, sym- bolic value as great literature, notwithstanding the fact that even the symbolic interpretations vary greatly, e.g. the often conflicting interpretations of the Fall of Man given by Freudians, Neo-Freudians and Jungian psychoanalysts. In brief, all myths, insofar as they are adjudged to be incompatible with nor- mative, scientific knowledge contain some elements of the false, fictitious or incredible, but some myths may, nevertheless, contain implicitly a greater degree of universal, symbolic truth than others. The great myths lend them- selves to a great variety of symbolic interpretations and their greatness lies precisely in their prolific suggestiveness for the creative imagintaion of the sensitive artist. That is to say, there is no one single type of symbolic inter- pretation of a given myth which is necessarily the correct one, and all attempts o20 Young, 1944; MacIver, 1947.</page><page sequence="10">BIDmNEY] CONCEPT OF MYTH AND PSYCHOCULTURAL EVOLUTION 25 at a "scientific" mythology are bound to fail. In their attempts to "rational- ize" the symbolic significance of ancient myths, modern social scientists, and particularly the psychoanalysts (Freudian and non-Freudian alike), are but inventing "scientific" myths of their own. We must distinguish, also, between mythical beliefs and their artistic ex- pression. For example, Dante's Divine Comedy and Milton's Paradise Lost are not myths because they are products of the creative imagination of great poets, but because the basic beliefs of these poets concerning the Fall of Man are no longer taken literally or seriously. If, however, one accepted their basic religious beliefs he would not regard these great poems as myths, but rather, in agreement with their authors, as artistic expressions of fundamental religi- ous truths warranted by divine revelation. It is, therefore, not the poem itself which is mythological but rather the basic, underlying beliefs which it pre- supposes. Furthermore, if it be granted that myths are universal phenomena orig- inating in a plurality of motives and involving all mental faculties which may contribute to social delusion and error, then we may also accept the theory of the continuity of pre-critical, critical and scientific thought. There will be no need for us to attempt to reconstruct the mentality of primitive, pre-cul- tural man in order to arrive at a notion of the origin of myth. A critical, com- parative, psychocultural and ethnohistorical study of man reveals the essential similarity of the processes at work in the formation of myth, while allowing for differences in the types of myth which prevail at different times and in dis- parate cultures. According to the psychocultural approach advanced here, the so-called mythopoeic mind is a universal phenomenon characteristic of man at all times; all that has changed is the form of expression. Inpre-critical cultures, myths of magic, culture-hero tales, cosmogonic and theogonic myths tend to prevail. In critical but pre-scientific culture, myths of the miraculous and supernatural gain currency. If, on the other hand, one rejects with Spinoza2' the notion of a sphere of the supernatural and identifies God and nature, then all narratives of the supernaturaland miraculous are treated as irrational myths. Science, in turn, gives rise to its own crop of secular myths, since science, as a self-correcting quest for knowledge, tends to outmode some of its own concepts and theories. In our so-called scientific culture, we have the secular beliefs of pseudo-science, such as the myths of racial superiority and the stereotypes of racial and national character. That is why, as Barrows Dunham22 has urged, the struggle of "Man against Myth" demands such ceaseless vigilance and self-conscious, critical analysis. Myth is most potent when it is assumed complacently that one is free of it. The sociopolitical myths of our time are the product of the divorce of scientific thought from the social values which underlie our effective, social beliefs and institutions. 2 Spinoza, 1906; Bidney, 1940. n Dunham, 1947.</page><page sequence="11">26 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [52, 1950 According to the psychocultural thesis here submitted, myth varies with the historical stages of cultural thought, but the process of myth-making does not die a natural death with the emergence of critical, scientific thought. Each epoch has its own type of myth and the age of science has inevitably produced its own secular myths of rationalization. We must reckon with the fact that cultural progress is not inevitable, and that rational thought has proved itself quite capable of undermining its own foundations by espousing myth as a "higher" form of truth in the interests of national solidarity23 and by reducing all cultural ideologies to the level of fictions. Normative, critical, scientific thought provides the only tested means of combatting the growth of myth, but it may do so only on condition that it retains its own integrity, and does not mistake reason for rationalization.
