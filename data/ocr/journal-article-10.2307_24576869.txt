Together, they also found a passage that described the conditions of a Hooverville where Bud stayed. "This can be a close reading that includes intertextual connections to the social stud ies readings they'll be doing," said Mimi. By using a qualitative analysis process of a familiar book, these teachers successfully identified text complexities that offered new teaching oppor tunities to deepen their students' interpretive and critical thinking skills. Using Qualitative Analysis to Improve Comprehension Instruction The CCSS-ELA Standards call for thoughtful instruc tion to support student success with more complex texts. In other words, increasing student facility with more complex texts is much more complicated than simply analyzing a text quantitatively and assign ing that text to a given student because of its higher lexile. Quantitative measures provide teachers with an important dimension of information about text complexity, but they do not guide instructional deci sions or suggest why a student might find a given text difficult. When planning instruction based on text complexity, qualitative analysis needs to be given equal attention. Literacy researchers and thoughtful educators have long known that texts must be exam ined qualitatively as well While U is essential to as quantitatively in order t0 conduct a thoughtful content identify factors that make a text more or less accessible analysis of the materials, t0 readers To teach reading analysis of text complexity comprehension well, teach ers can determine which is for naught if the reader is factors contri5uted t0 the overlooked in the process. complexity of the text and then make instructional decisions about how to support students' under standing of each factor such that they can apply that knowledge to new texts that they read. Several of the qualitative factors described in this article locate the reader at the center of discussion. In fact, qualitative analysis of familiar ity, prior academic knowledge, cultural knowledge, language conventions, and registers could not take place without considering what the reader brings to, and may take away from, a text. While it is essen tial to conduct a thoughtful content analysis of the materials, analysis of text complexity is for naught if the reader is overlooked in the process. "Deep thinking," as Martinez and McGee (2000) described over a decade ago in their compre hensive overview of the evolving role of children's literature in reading instruction, foretold the intent of the CCSS as they exist today. They noted: . . . that literacy involves more than comprehending the literary object; that reading involves perceiving the complex relationships offered by multiple perspec tives. We are moving toward a definition of reading that moves beyond comprehension and response into what we call deep thinking. Deep thinking requires seeing more than one perspective, searching out a variety of interpretations, and finding compelling connections among and between perspectives, interpretations, and self. (p. 166) Even in those states that have not adopted the CCSS, critical thinking skills are increasingly emphasized. Elementary teachers can balance foundational skills with instruction on complex text comprehension. This balance can develop the skills young readers need to understand the written code and to read with increasing automaticity and fluency. Some instructional time must be devoted to students' understanding of complex texts that afford them the space to apply critical thinking. Stu dents benefit both from access to texts that stretch their thinking and from instruction that guides deep thinking. Elementary teachers who understand the qualitative factors that contribute to a text's com plexity can plan instruction and support so that all students benefit from what rich text has to offer.

Like "Language Arts Journal" on Facebook Call for Nominations: James Moffett Award NCTE's Conference on English Education offers this award to support teacher research projects that fur ther the spirit and scholarship of James Moffett. Moffett, a great champion of the voices of K-12 teachers, focused on such ideas as the necessity of student-centered curricula, writing across the curriculum, alterna tives to standardized testing, and spiritual growth in education and life. This award is offered in conjunction with the National Writing Project. Applications for the Moffett Award should be in the form of a proposal for a project that one or more K-12 classroom teachers wish to pursue. The proposal must include: • A cover page with the applicant's name, work and home telephone numbers and addresses, email address, a brief profile of the applicant's current school and students, and a brief teaching history (when and where the applicant has taught). • A proposal (not more than 5 pages, double-spaced, 12-point font) that includes an introduction and rationale for the work (What is the problem or question to be studied? How might such a project influence the project teacher's practice and potentially the practice of other teachers? Why is such a project important?); a description of the connection to the spirit and scholarship of James Moffett; initial objectives for the study (realizing these might shift during the project); a clear, focused project description that includes a timeline (What will be done? When? How? By whom?); a method of evaluating the project (What indicators might reviewers note that suggest the work was valuable to the researcher and to other teachers?); and a narrative budget (How will the money be spent?). • A letter of support from someone familiar with the applicant's teaching and perceived ability to implement and assess the proposed project. Moffett Award winners receive a certificate designating the individual as the 2014 recipient of the CEE Mof fett Award and a monetary award (up to $1,000) to be used toward implementation of the proposed project. Submit proposals to CEE Moffett Award, NCTE, 1111 W. Kenyon Road, Urbana, IL 61801-1010 or cee@ncte.org, Attn: CEE Administrative Liaison. Proposals must be postmarked by May 1, 2014. Propos als will be judged on such criteria as the strength of the connection to James Moffett's scholarship and the perceived value and feasibility of the project.
