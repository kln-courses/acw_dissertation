<plain_text><page sequence="1">PELTENBURG, EDGAR. Lemba Archaeological Pro- ject, 2:2, A ceremonial area at Kissonerga (Stud. Med. archaeol. 70:3). xii, 118 pp., illus., plates, maps, tables, bibliogr. Goteborg: Paul Astroms Forlag, 1991 For the uninitiated, Lemba and Kassonerga are two modern villages near Paphos, in southwest- ern Cyprus. This detailed study, with several contributing authors (notably Diane Bolger- pottery, Elizabeth Goring- anthropomorphic figurines, Carolyn Elliot- - ground stone arte- facts), focuses on a unique Chalcolithic site- Mosphilia- near Kissonerga village, and within that site on two 'pits' which have provided some of the most remarkable finds yet uncovered in Early Prehistoric Cyprus. Unit 1015 contained heat-fractured stones, ash, and fifty-odd objects, including a pottery building model and a fig- urine shown in the act of giving birth. Adjacent unit 1225 contained a set of 'nested bowls' placed amidst more heat-cracked stones. Given the fact that this material was excavated in 1987, its comprehensive final publication in 1991 is exemplary even by the exacting Cypriot stand- ard. The lack of an index, not uncommon in this series, is the only serious shortcoming. Peltenburg maintains that these assemblages served ceremonial purposes, specifically birthing rituals, during the Middle Chalcolithic (late 4th millennium BC), and were preserved thereafter by virtue of being deliberate deposits, in which some of the artefacts were purposely broken. If one accepts this interpretation, we would have here the earliest evidence extant for communal ritual activity on the island of Cyprus. Peltenburg and collaborators give particular prominence to a meticulously detailed contextual analysis. The weight of evidence, and the prose in which it is presented, will make difficult read- ing for non-archaeologists, and occasionally make it difficult to follow the author's logic. Macroscopic attention is given to the wear, treatment and (deliberate?) breakage of objects, whilst comparative material data from prehistoric and protohistoric contexts in the eastern Me- diterranean are drawn fully into the discussion. When it comes to citing comparative ritual ma- terial, Peltenburg casts his net more widely. Al- though the reviewer recently treated many of the same concepts in a study of Cypriot Bronze Age ritual, ideology, and archaeology (Man (N.S.) 23 [1988] 133-63), Peltenburg neglects to make reference to it. Readers of Man may find the structure of Pel- tenburg's argument somewhat unusual, inas- much as he assumes from the outset what he should be attempting to prove. Moreover, he leaps back and forth from theory to data without first establishing unequivocally his interpretive framework. For example, Peltenburg begins (p. 1) by stating: 'Because of the anomalous, ritual nature of several purposeful acts here, this pub- lic, out-of-door space is referred to as a cere- monial area'. Already it is presumed that we are dealing with ritual and purposeful acts being con- ducted in a public place with ceremonial over- tones. Should these factors not have been regarded as hypothetical, at least until the fine- grained contextual analysis was presented? The theoretical framework in which these data are evaluated does not appear until the final chapter. This data-driven approach, for the most part standard in Cypriot archaeology, would have been far more effective if parts of the final chap- ter (especially pp. 85-8) had been rendered at the beginning. Here Peltenburg examines dif- ferent kinds of deliberate deposits, through which he seeks to assess the 'empirical fea- tures of the hoards in the ceremonial area at</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 807 Kissonerga' (p. 88). Once the data have been presented (pp. 1-84), and the interpretive basis established (pp. 85-8), Peltenburg moves on to discuss ritual, time, function and the 'institution- alization of religion' in Early Prehistoric Cyprus (pp. 88-108). Here one finds the most palatable text for general digestion. As a result of his data-thick prose and theory- thin argument, Peltenburg may not convince all readers of the deliberate events he believes to have precipitated these two deposits. Taphon- omic processes are never discussed as such, and once Peltenburg develops his scenario he never looks back. His exemplary contextual exposition conforms to the scheme devised: the 'Cypriot custom of intentional closure deposits' (p. 93) and the 'birth anthropomorphs' (p. 101) now take their place alongside such canonical Pelten- burg suppositions as the 'recurrent pre-Bronze Age building abandonment procedures'. Although I regard such canons as unproven, I applaud Peltenburg for evoking them. And whereas the evolutionary development of houses and shrines suggested (pp. 104-7) is not altogether convincing, at least the author makes enlightening comparisons (e.g. between the Mosphilia and later Vounous building models - pp.106-7) and contrasts (e.g. between the do- mestic cults of the earlier prehistoric periods and the 'temples' of the later Bronze and Iron Ages - p. 108). Whilst Peltenburg eschews Renfrew's admirable attempt to erect some material par- ameters of cultic activity (The archiaeology of cult, British School at Athens: London, 1991), at the same time he rightly cautions that our notions of the sacred and the profane are niot the same as those that motivated the residents of Middle Chalcolithic Mosphilia (p. 104). This observation is followed by the clearest statement in this rich and diverse volume, a statement with which the reviewer concurs fully: A sceptic could dismiss all these [artefacts] and the rituals in the ceremonial area as secular prestige objects and activities. The point is rather that there existed at Kissonerga a coher- ent range of equipment and facilities that served more than the requiremen1ts of a sin1gle house- hold and that subsequently were to become essential ingredients of temples.
