      <p>One hundred and fifty years after the publication of <italic>The Origin of Species</italic>, we have evolutionary versions of psychology, economics, political science, literary history, and feminist theory.<sup>1</sup> The multidisciplinary interest in evolution seems to end one important component of the science wars, but it has more accurately transformed them into a debate over the significance of their own ending. According to literary historian Brian Boyd (2009), this multidisciplinarity signals the sciences’ triumph over poststructuralist philosophies that celebrate contingency and relativism; for philosopher Elizabeth Grosz (2004), evolutionary theory forecloses any credible scientific opposition to such notions. While both camps agree that we should stop asking whether biological science can explain particular aspects of human experience, they disagree over the question of how to describe the resulting biology.</p>
      <p>The discipline of evolutionary psychology—the first field to export evolution outside the biological sciences—plays a bellwether role in these disagreements. Evolutionary psychology uses Darwinian principles to advance a universal account of human psychological experience, including everything from artistic impulses to gender psychology. Scholars like Boyd, who see evolution as the weapon that won the science wars for the sciences, frequently depict evolutionary psychologists as an intellectual avant-garde. Those like Grosz, who see evolution as having instead demanded a cease-fire, see evolutionary psychologists as a stodgy group. In her provocative call for a truly interdisciplinary study of sexual difference, for example, Grosz engages with Charles Darwin’s writings extensively but mentions evolutionary psychology rarely, usually to fault it for being unimaginative (Grosz 2004, 83). Brian Massumi (2002), another philosopher committed to creating new dialogues between scientists and humanists, likewise singles out evolutionary psychologists’ research program as a “prime example” of “imperialist disciplinary aggression” (19) that hampers truly innovative interdisciplinary work.</p>
      <p>Yet surprising convergences emerge between Grosz’s and Massumi’s research and the field that they claim to surpass. According to both thinkers, we must recognize temporality as the central feature of embodiment, and the concept of tendency offers a way for us to do so. Grosz argues that the temporal instability of evolution makes ineffable tendencies vastly more important than functionally ordered traits. Massumi reads tendency as “pure futurity … a futurity that is contemporary with the past’s contemporaneousness with the present” (2002, 15), or as “pastnesses opening directly onto a future but with no present to speak of” (30); for things to exist “tendentially” is for them to exist as “inducers of directional movement of which they mark the outside limits” (72). Yet, despite the distance these descriptions stake out from contemporary evolutionary psychology, tendencies themselves are neither new to that field nor a challenge to its assumptions. On the contrary, I will argue, they are central to it. Although significant differences certainly exist between these groups of scholars, the hallmark of their supposed difference is thus ironically something they share. This counterintuitive convergence points to a significant blind spot in the debates that evolutionary psychologists and poststructuralist philosophers are engaged in.</p>
      <p>This essay brings this blind spot into focus by analyzing the role of tendency in post-Darwinian debates over mind and body. Tendencies certainly predate Darwinian evolutionary theory, but they play a unique role in facilitating that theory’s application to the human mind. I explore that role here by considering both a very early and a very recent moment in the history of that application. First, I turn to nineteenth-century American zoologist William Keith Brooks, who helped establish evolutionary psychology as an academic and popular program when he published “The Condition of Women from a Zoölogical Point of View” (1879), a two-part essay arguing that men and women “tend” toward particular forms of intellect. Next, I turn to a 1990s exchange between evolutionary psychologist David M. Buss and philosopher of science David J. Buller, which examines whether men and women tend to have different experiences of romantic jealousy. The obsolescence of Brooks’s theory makes this comparison possible and productive: it allows us to disregard the content of his conclusions and focus instead on the tendential reasoning by which he drew them.</p>
      <p>That reasoning, I will argue, is more consequential than any particular theory. In both Brooks’s work and in the Buss/Buller exchange, the researchers make key errors that they have sufficient knowledge to avoid. Brooks created a complex theory of sexual differentiation and tried to anchor the mind in it, but he also assumed that the mind would include certain stereotyped features that his theory had ruled out. Rather than confront the incoherence in these parts of his theory, Brooks seems to have been blithely unaware of any problem. Likewise, Buss and Buller debate research into romantic jealousy without betraying any awareness that the hypothesis they are debating actually shifts multiple times in the research under review. I will argue that tendency plays a key role in both situations. Specifically, I will argue that it is part of a constellation of concepts—functions, tendencies, and cognitive fictions—through which we push the embodied mind far enough away from the traditionally conceived body to reflect a distorted version of it back to itself. In other words, we create a paradoxically neo-Cartesian version of Darwinian evolution.</p>
      <p>That this constellation recurs in late nineteenth-century writing and in the work of scholars who present themselves as opponents in very different debates today suggests that these issues are broadly cultural, not disciplinary, ones. The question of how Darwinian principles shape our understanding of the embodied mind has generated social controversy since the publication of <italic>The Origin of Species</italic> ([1859] 2000), but scholars discussing evolutionary psychology have approached the controversy in a distorting set of ways: they ask what social consequences particular hypotheses would have (and generally conclude that they are negative) or reject that question as “ideological” and ask instead whether the hypotheses are correct. To grasp the full relationship between the social and scientific, however, we must consider how the assumptions that we inherit about the mind/body relation shape our ability to generate evolutionary psychological claims—rather than only evaluate particular claims for their accuracy or social effects. This essay argues that cognitive fictions are such a key assumption and that we must grapple with them in any effort to make evolutionary theory the vocabulary for newly interdisciplinary studies of human experience.</p>

         <title>The abandonment of biology</title>
         <p>Brooks wrote “The Condition of Women from a Zoölogical Point of View” (1879) to determine whether evolution permitted feminism. The essay focuses on the attempt to open advanced education to women—what Brooks calls the “attempt to improve the condition of women by ignoring or obliterating the intellectual differences between them and men” (349–50). His argument against such education has two parts, published sequentially: the first offers a Darwinian analysis of the physiology of sex cells; the second uses that account to construct the “psychological evolution” (155) of gender. His conclusions, Brooks acknowledges, are reactionary: he throws the weight of his scientific credentials behind the proposition that educational access for women “must result in disaster” (350). For Brooks, as for most of his peers, evolutionary feminist theory is oxymoronic. But the only extended account of Brooks’s reasoning takes aim at his focus on “biology” in the way that Grosz complains feminist theory has done more broadly. Cynthia Eagle Russett (1991) links Brooks’s work to a “confusion between biology and culture pervading late-nineteenth-century thought” (86); for Russett, that confusion led Brooks to reject the social “equality of the sexes” on the basis of a reading of the “differing functions of the [male and female] sex cell” (93). Criticizing Brooks for being too biologically reductive has things exactly backwards, however: in fact, a deeper respect for the biological constraints that Brooks took for granted would have prevented his errors. Brooks’s work thus lends force to Grosz’s claim that biological analysis and feminist theory need not be opposed, while allowing us to see that his actual error is his reliance on a particular, tendential model of biology, which Grosz’s work and contemporary evolutionary psychology share.</p>
         <p>Brooks eventually turned his <italic>Popular Science</italic> essays into a book that begins with a critique of recapitulation, establishing his ability and willingness to reason carefully about biological form. Recapitulation theorized heredity, or the way organisms assume the characteristics of their species and not some other; it posited that they do so by repeating (recapitulating) the developmental stages through which their ancestors progressed as they evolved. Making an example of Ernst Haeckel, Brooks criticizes this theory for begging the question it purported to answer. To say that “individual development [recapitulates] the evolution of the species,” he notes, is to say that the “marvelous changes which lead from the simple egg … [to] a perfect bird” are “simply natural” (Brooks 1883, 31). Phrases like “simply natural,” he concludes, confirm that recapitulation “is in no sense an <italic>explanation</italic> of heredity” (31; emphasis added).</p>
         <p>This care in reasoning also appears in “The Condition of Women,” where he turns his attention to gender. There, he actually rejects the coarsest physiological theories of women’s incapacity for intellectual achievement. His peers argued that women’s reproductive anatomy demanded so much energy that none remained for intellectual complexity, a view that established a war between women’s wombs and brains. Brooks rejects this view in the language of political fairness: “It is no more than just … to point out that the peculiar bodily organization and physiological functions of woman have nothing to do with our conclusion. If the perpetuation of the human race were as simple as that of the starfish, where the demands made upon the female organism during reproduction are no greater than those made upon the male, the mind of woman would still be the organ of intellectual heredity, and the mind of man the organ of intellectual variation” (1879, 350). Brooks’s own account of sexual psychology is more elegant and nuanced. It combines male variability with pangenesis, Darwin’s theory of heredity. Male variability is the belief that males of a species exhibit more variation in secondary sex characteristics than females (Darwin 1871; Geddes and Thompson 1890; Fausto-Sterling 1992). Pangenesis (Darwin 1868) posited that evolution was enabled by particles called “germs” or “gemmules” that were emitted by every organ and collected in sex cells. These germs somehow recorded variations in their originating organs and provoked those same variations in offspring. The more germs, then, the more likely variations would be inherited. Combining these two ideas, Brooks hypothesizes that male sex cells have a heightened ability to accumulate germs. If germs “which are formed in the male body are vastly more likely to be transmitted to descendants than those which are formed in the female body” (Brooks 1883, 160), then “we should … expect to find that parts which are confined to [the] male [body] are more variable than parts confined to [the] female [body]” (166–67)—an expectation that male variability confirmed. Brooks reasons further that if males varied, females would “conserve,” creating the twin engines of evolution: variation and heredity. “The Condition of Women” seeks to determine how this physiological system would affect gender psychology.</p>
         <p>This methodical use of sex cell physiology creates a theory of gender less fixed and binarized than innovatively androgynous. First, it posits a complex set of biological systems that produce both masculinity and femininity as equally contingent effects. This approach anticipates developmental systems theory (DST), a research model that attempts to strip biological investigations of scientific essentialism. DST proponents argue that biological research becomes essentialist when it describes the distributed workings of a complex system (including such elements as genes, mitochondrial DNA, fetal environment, nutrition, and toxins) as if they could be divided into a preexisting blueprint housed in just one of that system’s elements (genes) and the unfolding of that blueprint in all the others. These blueprints, Susan Oyama (2000a, 2000b) claims, represent a modern-day “ghost in the machine”—an artificially congealed and rigid version of something that is diffuse and variable (Oyama 2000b, 8). Oyama depicts DST as a feminist biology; Brooks’s peers responded to his work with a similar view. Patrick Geddes and J. Arthur Thompson (1890) believed that Brooks’s biology made masculinity too capricious and fragile—that is, too much like femininity. They objected to Brooks’s efforts to derive some features of masculinity from others, believing the effort made masculinity dependent and derivative; they preferred to define masculinity as the set of all things that correlated with it, effectively rendering it an explanation of itself. By focusing on biological reductivism, we risk missing this key element of Brooks’s work; Russett (1991) in fact groups Brooks with Geddes and Thompson as scientists who believed in “constitutional maleness and femaleness” (89), even though both Geddes and Thompson claimed that such a theory would render Brooks’s account superfluous.</p>
         <p>Had Brooks followed his account to its logical conclusion, he would have made good on the androgynous implications of his method in a second way: Brooks’s derivation of male variability from sex cells would predict no cognitive sex differences. According to the theory of pangenesis on which Brooks drew, germ aggregation led to evolutionary change only in a second generation. A heightened ability by male sex cells to aggregate germs would determine a variation’s origin (fathers) but not the locus of its inheritance (sons or daughters). Thus, only transmission of variations would be linked to males; their development or display would not be. While Brooks’s account should predict a lot of variation in male secondary sex characteristics, it shouldn’t predict a greater male display of variation in body parts shared by both sexes—and thus no greater cognitive differences, because both males and females possess brains.<sup>2</sup> Someone wishing to use Brooks’s theory to discuss the education of women should have noted that there were no cognitive grounds for resisting such education (regardless of political or social ones).</p>
         <p>The only thing more surprising than Brooks’s creation of a feminist biology is his complete obliviousness to its implications. Having established his account of male variability, Brooks used it to assure his <italic>Popular Science</italic> readers that men had a clearly greater ability than women to “pursue original trains of abstract thought, to reach the great generalizations of science, and to give rise to the new creations of poetry and art” (1879, 155). The essay concludes that if higher education aims to produce people capable of such things, it will be wasted on women. This conclusion is, of course, reactionary, but it takes a strained reading to attribute it to a sudden rearing of biological reductivism. In fact, we would have to posit—as Russett does—that Brooks must have assumed something that he never says: “that the transmission [of germs] was [itself] sex-linked” (Russet 1991, 93). But if we acknowledge that Brooks’s biological account demands a conclusion directly opposite to the one he draws, and if we recognize that Brooks appears to believe that his reasoning really does work without any additional, unstated assumptions, then we need to explain not what assumptions he must have made but instead why he didn’t realize that he needed any.</p>
         <p>To answer this question, I propose that rhetorical analysis is particularly useful. Such an analysis does not imply that the phenomena Brooks studied were purely rhetorical creations; it evaluates the effects of his language on his reasoning about those phenomena. I begin by characterizing Brooks’s argument as a persuasive act, one in which he made conscious decisions aimed at particular audiences. While such decisions are deliberate, their effects are not always so: rhetorical decisions may shape an argument’s substance in unmarked ways. A rhetorical analysis of Brooks’s essay reveals a reservoir of invisible constraints regarding the relation of body to mind, the core issue in his attempt to link sex cell physiology and gender psychology. More specifically, I argue that Brooks made his most important rhetorical decision when he cast germ accumulation as male sex cells’ “especial and peculiar <italic>function</italic>” (1879, 154; emphasis added). Reading this appeal to function rhetorically recasts a decades-long philosophical debate over functions in evolutionary analysis. Until the 1960s, functions’ Aristotelian link to telos motivated charges that they were logically impossible—an anthropomorphic attribution of purposive behavior to elements that couldn’t have goals. This rejection has not stuck because, as philosopher of science Robert Cummins (1975) puts it, we need functions every time we wish to capture the difference between what something does and how it does it. Evolutionary analysis in particular makes this distinction: researchers study the effects of traits within an environment, not the mechanics underlying those effects. Thus, philosophical investigation has focused on how to ascribe functions in a nonteleological way. Yet the rhetoric of function in Brooks’s work is not teleological but paradoxical: it creates a template for defining the essence of a thing in terms of what the thing might not do—a template that Brooks ultimately made central to his argument and that allowed him to establish and abandon limits at the same time. This template left all of Brooks’s careful reasoning about gender intact but irrelevant, turning gender into a floating propensity that would always exceed the empirical facts making it up. This process, I will argue, is not limited to Brooks’s work but becomes a persistent cultural habit when talking about the evolution of gender, one that is hazy enough to cross the disciplinary and theoretical lines that separate Grosz’s feminist theory from the evolutionary psychology it seeks to complicate.</p>

         <title>The functions and tendencies of sexual difference</title>
         <p>To appreciate Brooks’s rhetorical use of the term “function,” we need to note that he didn’t really need this term in order to make his argument. Most basically, Brooks argued that germ accumulation was one of the male sex cell’s abilities. He also believed that this ability conferred a reproductive advantage on organisms that bore it and made a unique contribution to a larger system of sexual reproduction in which those organisms participated. Finally, on the basis of both of these facts, Brooks implied that germ aggregation could have been what the male sex cell was selected for—that is, the environmentally specific effect that led to its increased incidence in a population. The philosophy of science now has technical terms for Brooks’s final two claims: contributions to systems are called “causal roles,” and effects that may have been selected for are called “selected effects” (Cummins 1975; Millikan 2002). Brooks did not need the term “function” to convey any of these ideas, however, whether in their nineteenth-century or twenty-first-century forms. Although it is certainly possible to use the term “function” to convey ability, reproductive advantage, a unique contribution, or an effect that has been selected for (as well as to convey causal role or selected effects), the term “function” does not communicate these meanings any better than those phrases themselves do. The term was superfluous to the substance of Brooks’s claims and thus requires rhetorical analysis to fully understand.</p>
         <p>And whatever the technical details of Brooks’s argument, the term “function” brings a great deal of rhetorical force to it. In its most everyday definition, this term conveys that there is something at stake in, or something riding on, a particular action. These stakes have two consequences. The first has to do with propriety. As Brooks puts it, the ability of the male sex cell to accumulate germs is its “especial and distinctive” function, language that signals that we are in the realm of definition, or of laying out the actual properties of a thing. The <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic> definition of “function” points to this register, noting that a function is a “special kind of activity” that is “proper” to an object.<sup>3</sup> The sense of propriety, of belonging, suggests an essential, inherent characteristic, without which the very identity of a thing changes. Rhetorically, functions thus insist that what is at stake is inherent and unavoidable. At the same time, however, these special and proprietary activities arise precisely and only in the space in which they might not occur: when something isn’t performing its function, we don’t generally say that it doesn’t have a function but instead that it isn’t functioning.<sup>4</sup> The inherence or inescapability of what is at stake is thus also fragile and delicate. To put these three implications together, we can say that functions define a result as both central to and detachable from the thing that might produce it. The rhetorical consequence is to create a sense of necessity and of looming unavailability at the same time.</p>
         <p>These rhetorical consequences play an important role in Brooks’s essays, whose publication in <italic>Popular Science</italic> aimed specifically at a nonacademic audience. By discussing the function of the male sex cell in a nontechnical sense, Brooks made a rhetorical choice to call his audience’s attention to what was at stake in his understanding of sexual difference. Given Brooks’s goals, this choice was a good one, for his theory entailed a set of stakes particularly important to American readers. Although Brooks did not explicitly acknowledge the racialized political and social context in which he wrote, he nonetheless made race the ultimate consequence of his argument about sex cells and gender difference. By referring to the function of sex cells, Brooks communicated to his nineteenth-century American audience that his particular model of sexual difference was absolutely essential to the production of racial difference, and at the same time that it was inescapably fragile. The clear message was that anyone who cared about race should care about Brooks’s argument, too. This rhetorical positioning drew heavily on and consolidated contemporary discourses of the intersections of race and gender, but more importantly, it established a template for reading evolution and gender paradoxically, and Brooks’s move from physiology to psychology unwittingly drew on that template.</p>
         <p>To see the context for this appeal, we have to recognize that Brooks was hardly alone in articulating sexual and racial difference: recapitulation, the theory for which he had such distaste, produced the most influential late nineteenth-century account of the intersection between sex and race (Stepan 1993; Bederman 1995). Brooks’s own model is more tightly entwined, however. By making males responsible for variation, Brooks effectively makes them responsible for difference as such; as he puts it, “there must be a greater uniformity in female character than in male character” (1879, 348). More specifically, because variation is the engine of evolutionary differentiation, Brooks’s assignment of variation to male organisms actually makes evolution the function of the male and heredity or stasis what would happen if there were no males. Brooks inadvertently says as much: while the male organism starts out as “the <italic>progressive or variable</italic> factor in the process of the evolution of the race,” it soon becomes “the <italic>originating</italic> element in the process of evolution” (1879, 150, 154; emphasis added). Brooks’s explicit reference to “the race” is not what makes his argument one about racial difference; rather, racial difference was considered the primary unit of human difference and evolution by late nineteenth-century scientists.<sup>5</sup>
         </p>
         <p>A long passage explicates the racial subtext of Brooks’s argument, leading his theory of sexual difference to culminate in racial difference as the most specific unit of human identity: <disp-quote>
               <p>All the characteristics which unite [the human child] with the other vertebrates, as a member of the sub-kingdom Vertebrata, are like those of its parents, and also those which place it in the class Mammalia, and in its proper order, family, genus, and species. It also shares with its parents the features or race characteristics of the particular tribe or race to which they belong. If they are Chinese, Indians, or negroes, the child belongs to the same race, and manifests all the slight, superficial peculiarities of form, constitution, and character by which that race is characterized. Even the individual peculiarities of the parents, intellectual and moral as well as physical, are now known to be hereditary. … We must recognize the universality of the law of heredity, but we must not overlook the equally well-established fact that each organism is the resultant of this law and another, the law of variation. … Paleontology and embryology now … prove that all hereditary characteristics, even the most fundamental, were originally individual variations. (1879, 146–47)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Brooks’s discussion of “peculiarities” is key, and his approach to them takes an hourglass conceptual shape. The gradual move from kingdom to individual parent seems to constrict import, and by the time the discussion gets to racial groupings the “peculiarities” are as “slight” and “superficial” as the word itself sounds. The significance expands, though, when we learn that “individual peculiarities” actually determine the “most fundamental” hereditary characteristics. Indeed, these suddenly consequential “peculiarities” are just another word for the male variations that Brooks has called the “originating element” in the evolutionary process. Thus, all forms of group difference are implicated by Brooks’s argument about gender. Just as males vary, their variations produce new, and explicitly racialized, forms of difference.</p>
         <p>Brooks’s rhetorical appeal might be of mild interest if it remained only a conscious act of argumentative positioning. But it doesn’t: it bleeds into Brooks’s argument in apparently unconscious ways, dramatically shaping its fundamental components and eventually facilitating his flawed leap from sex cells to psychology. That process takes place in three stages. First, Brooks’s rhetoric of function shapes the construction of his research methods. His decision to label certain things “functions” leads him to render elements and their effects so synonymous that he fails to recognize when his research method failed to correlate them empirically. This failure leads Brooks to be more confident about what a thing’s function is than he should be. While this methodological failure indirectly shaped Brooks’s conclusions, the rhetoric of function directly supplies the content of his conclusions as well. Brooks uses function as a template to define the nature of sex differences as paradoxical—whatever they happen to consist of. Thus, he makes them empirical at the same time that he insulates them from empirical test. Finally, Brooks uses the rhetoric of function to locate such paradoxical differences. Specifically, he maps the poles of his paradox onto the relation between mind and body, turning the mind into a kind of backstop for gendered characteristics that his own argument makes it difficult to locate in traditionally conceived bodies. By surveying this process in full, we get a picture of the rhetorical structure that continues to shape discussions of evolution today.</p>
         <p>First, in order to establish the function of the male and female in sexual reproduction, Brooks’s essays survey the relationship between variation (the dependent variable of his research) and the male and female sex cells (the independent variables of it). To make this survey successful, Brooks seeks to show that he can isolate his dependent variable from his independent variables—that is, that he can break down the process of sexual reproduction into the contributions of male and female sex cells. Although that task might seem to pose an obstacle insofar as the defining characteristic of sexual reproduction is ordinarily the conjoining of male and female sex cells, Brooks believes he has found a way around it: parthenogenesis, or the solitary reproduction by the female of a sexually differentiated species.<sup>6</sup> While “The Condition of Women” offers only a breezy explanation of the process, <italic>Law of Heredity</italic> spends a great deal of time documenting specific instances.<sup>7</sup> Having distinguished parthenogenic from sexual reproduction, Brooks concludes that the role of the male sex cell is isolated whenever males participate in sexual reproduction. And having purportedly isolated male and female roles in sexual reproduction, Brooks’s next step is to show that the male role initiates and perpetuates “new variations” (1879, 150).</p>
         <p>Yet a problem pervades this method. Brooks’s functional definition of gender invisibly supplies the analytical categories with which he interprets his data, creating a procedural circle that is both easy to make and easy to miss. Brooks contends that by distinguishing male-fertilized reproduction from parthenogenic reproduction, he has isolated the roles of male and female sex cells. The distinction between male-fertilized and parthenogenic reproduction, however, does not isolate any such thing. Rather, it distinguishes sexual reproduction—with both male and female sex cells—from the possibility, in some female organisms, of asexual reproduction. Male-fertilized reproduction, in other words, is simply sexual reproduction; nothing distinct to either males or females has been isolated in the process at all. Brooks’s rhetoric of function is responsible for his failure to acknowledge this point. Brooks has described the uniquely variable results of sexual reproduction as the “function” of the male sex cell and has thus presented sexual reproduction as the addition of the male to asexual reproduction. As he puts it, there is “no essential distinction” between sexual and asexual reproduction except “the necessity for impregnation” (1879, 149)—that is, the necessity for the male. Once the event of sexual reproduction simply <italic>is</italic> the function of the male element, the terms “sexual” and “male” can readily replace each other, with little sense that any replacement is even going on, and one can imagine that one has isolated male function when one is really looking at a sexual reproductive event.<sup>8</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Brooks does not just allow his rhetoric of function to lead him into methodological errors; doing even more damage, he embraces that rhetoric as a substantive template for sexual difference itself. I have suggested that functionalist rhetoric depicts an effect as both synonymous with and detachable from the thing that performs it. Brooks makes this paradox central to sexual difference by positing that gender consists not of characteristics but of tendencies. Just as rhetorical analysis reframes the contemporary philosophical debate over functions, appreciating the relationship between the rhetoric of function and the work of tendency will reframe another node in contemporary debates over scientific reasoning—this time, debates over statistical analysis. The history of science includes a long-standing debate over statistical analysis that focuses on whether such analysis maintains the distinction between descriptions of groups and prescriptions regarding individuals (Poovey 1998; Thrailkill 2007). Yet tendency works by creating new kinds of description.</p>
         <p>To appreciate how it does so, we can take a neutral example: the statement that “it will tend to rain today.” The awkwardness of this sentence stems from the fact that it combines a definitive prediction with something that may or may not occur—a combination that is the hallmark of tendency. If we imagine movement taking place along a continuous line and we imagine one end of that line representing a traditionally conceived observable characteristic, then tendency interprets the act of moving—whether it consists of a small step, a large step, or a final step—not as a step toward a characteristic, nor as a prescription that dictates eventual arrival at the line’s end, but instead as a characteristic in and of itself. Thus, in the meteorological example, the notion of tendency would require us to describe a day as in some sense rainy even if the day brought no rain. The result is a paradoxical empiricism, one that makes it irrelevant whether we move from empirical descriptions to normative prescriptions. Brooks bears that out when he claims that the “average woman” will be more like other average women than like the “average man” (Brooks 1879, 348). There is nothing wrong with statistical discussions of the average of group values, of course, but Brooks can’t be using the term “average” in this way. Brooks believed that males would exhibit greater variation around a norm, not that a male norm was shifted higher than a female norm. For this reason, average males and females would actually be identical under Brooks’s argument. Yet Brooks asserts that the average male and female typify gender difference. This claim can work only if the average woman for whom something isn’t true still in some sense counts as a prototype of the woman for whom it is. That result is possible only if we assume that what the two women share is a tendency toward a characteristic rather than a characteristic itself.<sup>9</sup>
         </p>
         <p>This outcome becomes increasingly explicit as Brooks’s argument moves from sex cells to cognition. At first Brooks notes that the male sex cell does not just accumulate germs; it has a “tendency” to do so (1879, 151). Moreover, he reasons that “since the male has for its function the production of the variable reproductive element … it would clearly be of advantage that the male organism should acquire a peculiar <italic>tendency</italic> to vary” (151; emphasis added). Females, by contrast, “gradually acquire a <italic>tendency</italic> to develop … general characteristics more perfectly than the male” (151; emphasis added). This claim makes little sense, insofar as there is nothing inherently advantageous about variations per se.<sup>10</sup> Instead, Brooks seems to imagine some kind of tendency for organisms to become more and more aligned with their own supposed tendencies. This supertendency brings not only the source and inheritor of variation into alignment but also the products of variable organs: because the male transmits and inherits more variations, male minds become more variable than female minds, and thus also there is a “greater uniformity in female character than in male character” (348). By the time such migrating tendencies have found their way to minds, they have become impervious to their own implementation—so that Brooks can offer the strange disclaimer that his understanding of male cognition actually does not apply to most males. The capacity for intellectual rigor that he has defined as the function of the male is actually “exceptional” even among men, he notes, and it “must not enter into our conception of the ordinary male mind” (155). Nevertheless, he notes, the ordinary male mind does indeed fulfill the male function because it possesses, “in a lesser degree,” the power of “originating and of generalizing from new experience” (155). Thanks to tendencies, in other words, men are exceptional even when they aren’t.</p>
         <p>Once Brooks has turned the paradox of functionalist rhetoric into a template for his substantive argument about gender, it reframes his culminating interest in the mind. Both the article and book form of Brooks’s argument take a long time getting to that interest, making their way first through a painstaking survey of one-celled organisms and plant reproduction in order to establish the unbroken line from “lower” life forms to human psychology that Darwin promised. Of course, we have seen that functionalist rhetoric propels this line at key moments, and we can now see that this rhetoric produces the central error of Brooks’s argument, the move from the physiology of sex cells to the psychology of gender. Brooks distributes the paradox of functionalism across mind and body, so that the mind “tends” toward identities that, as Brooks’s own argument acknowledges, the body may not reliably produce. In Brooks’s model of evolutionary psychology, functional fictions thus become what we might call cognitive fictions.</p>
         <p>We see this effect in the symmetry that Brooks imagines between variable bodies and variable minds. To get from the body to the mind, Brooks supposes that variations accumulated by the male sex cell will make the mind itself more productive of variation. At first glance this supposition seems unremarkable: variation leads to variation. But of course a host of other possible outcomes existed that would also have ensured Brooks’s ultimate goal of deeming higher education more effective for men than for women: for instance, that male minds would work faster, more precisely, or in a more organized way. If we look in Brooks’s essays for the series of steps that indeed lead from variation to variation rather than, say, from variation to speed, we will find nothing more than the symmetry of the phrase itself. In fact, in this exchange of connection for symmetry, we confront the heart of Brooks’s imagined relation between body and mind: this model builds slowly and patiently from one element to another—from gemmules to the male sex cell to complex organs—and then at the last minute, when it finally arrives at the mind, it assumes that the body will push the mind just far enough away to reflect the body back to itself. And what the mind will reflect back to the body is its tendencies. In this way, the strangely disembodied mind supplies the perfect location for the notion of tendency: if tendency interprets movement as a characteristic, then the mind as mirror puts a picture of that process in the place where a traditionally conceived endpoint would be. Far from reducing the mind to the body, this model makes it possible to relocate to the mind all of those characteristics that the body might not reliably produce. If evolutionary theory makes the body newly contingent and unpredictable, Brooks’s vision of the embodied mind turns it into an ironically secure kind of storage space for those characteristics that one considers particularly important. It thus makes a strange kind of sense that when Brooks most directly discusses cognition, he begins to concede most explicitly the paradoxes of tendency, acknowledging that not all male minds actually work the way male minds supposedly work.</p>
         <p>Brooks seems to realize the power of his imagined mind/body relation, for he uses it to take his argument a couple of odd steps farther than he claimed it would go. Having produced an account of a sexually differentiated mind, Brooks argues that minds also identify with sexual difference. This final argument suggests the mind’s self-conscious organization of itself around ideas, demonstrating that Brooks’s evolutionary model of a mirroring mind is not so distant from a traditionally dualistic conception of the mind/body relation. Brooks makes his argument in a chart that offers a set of predictions about intersubjective epistemology. Assuming that male variability will lead to a “greater uniformity in female character than in male character” (1879, 348), Brooks infers that it will be easier for an average woman to predict “what another average woman will do, or feel, or think, or say in any given case, than for one average man to predict in the same way of another average man” (1879, 348). He suggests that this set of differentiated interpretive abilities will also sexually differentiate the act of persuasion, which consists in “a vivid appreciation of … established motives and incentives to conduct” (1879, 349). The headings of the table summarizing these inferences (table 1) reads like a sentence from left to right, with each line filling in the substance; the first line would read “The power of women to foresee the conduct of or to influence women is greater than the power of men to foresee the conduct of or to influence men.” According to Brooks, the degree of difference would decrease going down the chart.<table-wrap id="tb1" position="float">

         <p>The chart’s specific inferences are arbitrary and contradictory. For instance, if women represent a lowest common psychological denominator—a “fundamental similarity” (1879, 348)—that men exceed, then we could expect women to have a harder time forecasting men’s actions than the other way around. The specific differences, however, matter less than the fact that all of them are saturated with consciousness of the categories they claim to produce. The chart’s divisions do not claim only that women and men make guesses that more often turn out to be right about women and men, respectively, but that women actively read women as such and that men actively read men as such. Sexual difference thus becomes an intellectual filter for recognizing itself. It becomes—like functions—not only fictional but a specifically cognitive fiction: a built-in conceptual habit rather than either a fully embodied category or a social construction.<sup>11</sup> Brooks’s language stresses the self-consciousness of this process by using the manipulative language of “power,” “fore[sight],” and “influence,” implying that women and men actively deploy this filter. This power becomes even greater if we recall that Brooks applies it to the average woman and man, for whom his claims would be least true: these women and men seem at the level of conscious prediction to duplicate those characteristics of their sex that they actually do not embody.</p>
         <p>Brooks’s work demonstrates that biological reductivism does not account for his scientific errors. We need a vocabulary that measures not the degree to which bodies structure our explanations but the kinds of bodies we take for granted. In Brooks’s case, as functionalist rhetoric takes over, he revives a dualistic vision of mind and body within an evolutionary scheme, creating a post-Darwinian neo-Cartesianism. That pattern leads him not only to make mistakes but to make mistakes that he had sufficient information to avoid. Writing of eugenics, the literary and cultural historian Daylanne K. English (2004) notes that we often pat ourselves on the back for getting over quaint scientific notions like “gemmules” as we marvel at the misguided, oppressive, or dangerous social practices those notions abetted. Yet we cannot dismiss Brooks’s errors as the result of a benighted commitment to scientific novelties. On the contrary, Brooks could have assumed all of his false premises and still realized that he needed very different conclusions. His failure is not one of knowledge but of reasoning, and it marks not the end but the beginning of a pattern—one we continue to rely on ourselves.</p>

         <title>The contemporary controversy over evolutionary psychology</title>
         <p>We have accepted the rhetoric of function so fully today that we have forgotten it is rhetorical. Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin campaigned against the dominance of functions in evolutionary history, comparing them to mechanisms like spandrels and genetic drift, but it never occurred to them that functions were rhetorical creatures and that it therefore makes no sense to ask how important a role they play in evolutionary processes (Gould and Lewontin 1979). That the most widely known critics of functionalism took functions themselves for granted points to the broader landscape in which students of evolutionary theory are introduced to functions as the ultimate explanation of the forms life takes, and in which critics who quarrel with functionalism continue to challenge only the extent of its application (Sperling 1991). If Brooks’s seemingly deliberate use of functionalist rhetoric shaped the substance of his argument, then our unconscious use of it would seem to make such influence impossible to avoid.<sup>12</sup>
         </p>
         <p>To challenge this pattern most effectively, I examine here a case in which critics and proponents of evolutionary psychology mirror Brooks’s errors. In 1992, evolutionary psychologist David M. Buss et al. published an influential study of sex differences in jealousy, which seemed to confirm social stereotypes about men and women—that men care about sexual infidelity (romantic partners having sexual relationships with others) and women care about emotional infidelity (romantic partners developing emotional attachments to others). In 2005, these findings became the subject of a debate between philosopher of science David J. Buller, who challenged Buss et al. in a book-length critique of evolutionary psychology, and Buss and Martie Hasselton, who responded to Buller's critique. Although the various elements of Buss et al.'s original findings are elaborate, one element of the debate is extraordinary: the participants in it not only disagree over whether Buss et al. prove their hypothesis but also fail to recognize what that hypothesis actually consists of. Buller focuses on what I call hypothesis 1, insisting it is not supported; Buss et al. focus on what I call hypothesis 2, insisting that it is; both fail to appreciate that the original research slips back and forth between the two. Across their disagreements, then, both make arguments structured by important invisible assumptions. As in Brooks’s work, the rhetoric of function begins to put those assumptions in play.</p>
         <p>Buss et al.’s original research does not use the term “function,” but it uses a host of associated terms. For example, the authors hypothesize that “sex differences in jealousy emerged in humans as <italic>solutions</italic> to the respective <italic>adaptive problems</italic> faced by each sex” (1992, 251; emphasis added). “Adaptive problems” refers to constraints that create selective pressures; “solutions” refers to mechanisms that ensure fitness within those constraints; the specific effects through which mechanisms achieve fitness (i.e., traits or abilities that are selected for) are known as functions. This language thus puts functions in play. Moreover, the tight relationship between problems and solutions gets transferred to the relation between jealousy and its supposed function, while the always-present possibility that a solution will not work suggests function’s fragility. Jealousy, in other words, has an effect proper to it that it might not fulfill. As in Brooks’s work, this paradoxical essence that might not exist creates a sense of rhetorical urgency: whatever jealousy does, it’s important. Jealousy solves problems—adaptive problems, problems of survival. In fact, it contributes to the survival of Buss et al.’s readers, the humans in whom it emerged. Our link to those humans reinforces the rhetorical effect: the language allows us to toy with the idea that they, too, would have found jealousy essential before they had it. While there is nothing wrong with studying sex differences in jealousy, nor with studying the contributions of forms of jealousy to survival or reproduction, we don’t need this rhetoric to do either of these things.<sup>13</sup> As in Brooks’s work, the rhetoric becomes an unacknowledged template for contracting and expanding claims.</p>
         <p>Buss et al. first claim that sexual and emotional infidelity “should be weighted differently by men and women” (1992, 251), but it is not clear what this difference consists of. The next version of the hypothesis identifies one possible answer: “that men and women differ in which form of infidelity … triggers more upset and subjective distress” (252). This option opens up three more possibilities: it could mean that one kind of infidelity triggers more intense distress; that one kind of infidelity more often triggers distress than the other kind; or that more men experience a certain kind of distress than another kind, and vice versa for women. Whatever the meaning, the fact that Buss et al. discuss contrasting kinds of jealousy and link those kinds to men and women suggests that we should see contrasting patterns in men and women as well.</p>
         <p>The first statement of the empirical findings reinforces this expectation. Buss et al. report that “the first empirical probe, contrasting distress over a partner’s sexual involvement with distress over a partner’s deep emotional attachment, yielded a large and highly significant sex difference” (1992, 252). The promise to “contrast” one kind of jealousy with another, followed by the statement of a sex difference, suggests that contrasting kinds of jealousy appear in contrasting patterns in men and women. The next sentence reinforces that suggestion. Buss et al. note that “<italic>Fully 60%</italic> of the male sample reported greater distress over their partner’s potential sexual infidelity; <italic>in contrast</italic>, only 17% of the female sample chose that option, with 83% reporting that they would experience greater distress over a partner’s emotional attachment to a rival” (252; emphasis added). “Fully” emphasizes that 60 percent is greater than half of men, and 83 percent reinforces that the pattern flips for women. This is what I am calling hypothesis 1: the supposition that men experience one kind of jealousy and women experience the other kind.</p>
         <p>Things get hazier, however, in the next sentence. Buss et al. report that “[the first empirical] pattern was replicated with [a] contrast between sex and love,” where “the magnitude of the sex difference was large, with 32% more men than women reporting greater distress over a partner’s sexual involvement with someone else, and the majority of women reporting greater distress over a partner’s falling in love with a rival” (1992, 252–53). Despite the supposed replication, things are not at all parallel. The first statement of findings compares within-group percentages (60 percent vs. an implied 40 percent, 17 percent vs. 83 percent) and does not calculate a cross-group spread (43 percent difference), while the second statement of findings provides only the cross-group spread. The change in pattern correlates with a change in data. It turns out that in the second case, most men do not fit the already established “male” jealousy pattern. A minority (42 percent) reported the jealousy pattern that “fully 60%” selected in the first empirical probe. As a result, a new version of the hypothesis takes hold: the hypothesis cannot be that men and women will find contrasting kinds of infidelity upsetting (because they don’t) but instead that men will always find sexual infidelity more upsetting than women find it, even if they both find it less upsetting than emotional infidelity—what I call hypothesis 2. Buss et al. seem unaware that their hypothesis has changed.</p>
         <p>In his original critique, Buller (2005) also seems not to recognize it. He takes hypothesis 1 as Buss et al.’s claim and criticizes the authors for failing to support it. In their response, Buss and Haselton (2005) again overlook the variation; they accuse Buller of “misrepresent[ing]” the original argument, as if Buss et al. had never proposed hypothesis 1 (507). Only in his reply to Buss and Haselton does Buller finally note the “ambigu[ity]” in the claims (Buller, Fodor and Crume 2005, 509), but he sets it aside to insist on his own interpretation. His discussion points to even more examples of slipperiness, for although Buss et al. (1992) left off with hypothesis 2, Buss’s later popularization of the research (1994) cited hypothesis 1 as the proven conclusion. While it is important to sort out these competing claims, we must also ask how researchers who set out to draw a fair conclusion do not realize that they haven’t—the question Brooks’s work raises.</p>
         <p>This pattern points to the second stage in Brooks’s argument: the move from functionalist rhetoric to tendential logic. To see that stage here, take Buss et al.’s hypothesis 1. This hypothesis predicts that men by and large will feel sexual jealousy more than romantic jealousy, the results show that “fully 60%” of men do so, and Buss et al. conclude that “men’s jealousy is triggered primarily by cues to the possible diversions of their mate’s sexual favors to another man” (1992, 128).<sup>14</sup> Of course, 40 percent is a very large minority, especially when the characteristic lacking in that 40 percent is supposed to have increased rates of survival or reproductive success (if Buss et al. had found that 60 percent of hearts pump blood and 40 percent don’t, they’d place the word “only,” not “fully,” in front of 60 percent). So why don’t the authors conclude that they found two male jealousy patterns rather than just the expected one?</p>
         <p>A critique of statistical prescriptivism would complain that by transforming 60 percent of men into “men,” Buss et al. turn statistical majority into normative law, erasing the other 40 percent. But such a charge is not credible; the authors cannot imagine that sticking the word “fully” in front of 60 percent will make 40 percent look anomalous. “Fully” makes sense only if Buss et al. believe that a 60/40 spread really does reveal something about all men. In other words, they need to imagine that all men in some way do something that not all men do. We need the concept of tendency to explain this imagination, and we get it in the idea that “men’s jealousy is triggered <italic>primarily</italic>” by anything at all. Compared to a modifier like “most” (“most men’s jealousy”), “primarily” is a slippery term. “Most” has a numerical meaning that divides outcomes cleanly: it includes a number of cases in which something happens, and it excludes all other cases. “Primarily” has instead an ordinal meaning: “to a great or the greatest degree; for the most part, mainly” or “in the first instance.”<sup>15</sup> This ordinal meaning makes “primary” factors always part of a larger mixture within any given object, persisting even where they give way to secondary factors. The move from “60 percent of men” to “men’s jealousy is triggered primarily” shifts registers from numerical divisions to ordinal mixtures, and that shift allows what is true of 60 percent of men to become true of the other 40 percent (just as the average of what men do becomes in Brooks’s hands the “average man”). For Buss et al., all of these men’s jealousy is triggered “primarily” by the same thing: in 60 percent, that trigger is visible, and in the other 40 percent, it is not. In other words, men’s jealousy tends to be triggered by certain cues—even when it isn’t. The concept of tendency nullifies the descriptive difference between these two groups, so Buss et al. can look at them and describe them as one.</p>
         <p>The logical framework of tendency shapes not only hypothesis 1 but also the movement between it and hypothesis 2. While functionalist rhetoric bleeds into tendency within hypothesis 1, at the same time Buss et al.’s rhetoric keeps circling back to that hypothesis even when it isn’t borne out. The word choice, sentence structure, and selection of data at various moments all suggest hypothesis 1—the idea that there are male and female patterns of jealousy—even though Buss, Haselton, and Buller all eventually agree that the data best support hypothesis 2. That is why Buller seizes on hypothesis 1 as the one being tested. As in Brooks’s work, we see a rhetorical appeal to function, a substantial notion of tendency, and a failed effort to keep straight what has and hasn’t been proven.</p>
         <p>All of these points culminate in the third element of Brooks’s work: pushing the embodied mind far enough away from the traditionally conceived body to reflect supposed features of that body back to itself. For much longer than evolutionary psychology has existed, men’s biology has been identified with a sexual desire urgent enough to be uncontrollable, and women’s biology has been imagined as less productive of sexual desire than emotional attachments (Cott 1979). Buss et al.’s hypotheses at once depart from and duplicate these assumptions. They depart insofar as they deal with perceptual sensitivities and psychological orientations, not bodily capacities. Moreover, those sensitivities respond to partners whose imagined behaviors also counter stereotypes: men forming emotional attachments, women having sexual affairs. Yet the sensitivity reconstitutes stereotypes in the mind: men care about sex, even if it’s women having it; women care about emotional attachments, even if it’s men having them. Buss et al.’s descriptions of their hypothesis occasionally traffic in stereotype more directly: men look for the diversion of their partners’ sexual “favors,” they report—as if women’s sexuality is an act of generosity, not desire. The imagined mind thus reflects a set of stereotypes associated with the traditionally conceived body; it becomes a holding pen for cognitive fictions. This process ultimately narrows the hypotheses in the Buss/Buller exchange. For example, we might expect men who responded to cues of both sexual and emotional infidelity to reproduce more successfully than men who responded to either alone, given that these two things often have something to do with each other.</p>
         <p>This exchange thus shows that Brooks’s errors persist today. We may have replaced germ accumulation with jealousy cues, but the language in which we describe such concepts and interpret tests of them remains largely unchanged. Like Brooks, we treat functionalist rhetoric so transparently that it no longer seems rhetorical. We translate that rhetoric’s paradoxes into the logic of tendencies, and we map tendencies onto the mind/body relation, turning the mind into a mirror that reflects the traditionally conceived body back to itself. These problems would have mattered in Brooks’s work even if germ accumulation turned out to exist, and they matter in Buss and Buller’s exchange regardless of whether jealousy is sexually differentiated. The point is that we allow rhetorical choices to bleed into and distort our reasoning about such questions.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Tendencies pervade the modern sciences and humanities well beyond evolutionary theory. The authors of a recent study of space flight note that “a tendency to develop reentry orthostasis after a prolonged exposure to microgravity is a common problem among astronauts” (Summers et al. 2010, 1). Meant probabilistically, “tendency” is meaningless here, for the probability of something cannot be “common.” The term makes sense only with the paradoxical meaning I’ve charted above. Today this paradox increasingly surfaces through other terms, like “propensities” and “predispositions.” The essay on space flight, for example, goes on to note that “women have … a much greater predisposition to the development of OI [orthostatic intolerance] postflight than their male counterparts” (Summers et al. 2010, 1). Alongside orthostatic intolerance, scientists discuss propensities for outcomes as varied as breast cancer and obesity.</p>
         <p>Yet tendencies, propensities, and predispositions are also specifically connected to both evolutionary theory and evolutionary accounts of psychological experience. Within the philosophy of biology, the most accepted definition of evolutionary fitness is probabilistic propensity, which holds that a trait confers fitness on an organism if that trait has the probabilistic propensity of increasing the organism’s (reproductively viable) offspring. In a short piece on evolution and aesthetics, philosopher Denis Dutton (2002) speaks of “a general human tendency to prefer landscapes combining open spaces and trees (preferably trees that fork near the ground, and so offer escape from predation), water, green flora, flowers, and variegated cloud patterns” (208). And while Dutton is an enthusiast of evolutionary psychology, the pattern holds in those philosophers who see themselves as moving past that field. Grosz (2004) uses tendencies to insist that arbitrary aesthetic inclinations are an unappreciated engine of human evolution. Massumi (2002) develops his provocative definition of tendency as “pure futurity” (15) in part through a chapter on “the evolutionary alchemy of <italic>reason</italic>” (89; emphasis added). Using the example of a bee perceiving a flower, he argues that “a creature’s perception is exactly proportioned to its action upon [a] thing” (90) and further defines the relation between perception and action as a “tending” (91). Furthermore, the actions in question are (naturally) selected; as Massumi notes, what the bee sees and smells in the flower is “enough to extract pollen from it” (90).</p>
         <p>The example of probabilistic propensity clarifies what is at stake in this pattern. As Alex Rosenberg and Daniel W. McShea (2008) note, probabilistic propensities both separate and link fitness and reproductive success: “The fitter among competing organisms will not always [in actuality] leave more offspring” (312). This formulation evokes tendencies in its effort to insulate characteristics from their own failure. Yet tendencies have more serious effects. While philosophers of science disagree about whether probabilistic propensities can account for natural selection, the argument hinges on whether those propensities can really be distinguished from the empirical frequency with which outcomes occur—in other words, whether fitness and frequency are really different things. The effect of tendencies, however, is to blur such a difference: to assert that a particular thing really does take place even when it doesn’t. In Dutton’s talk of a “general human <italic>tendency to prefer</italic>” rather than of a “general <italic>human preference</italic>,” we see this empirical fluidity.</p>
         <p>I have argued in this essay that the constellation of functions, tendencies, and cognitive fictions are inherited concepts through which we conceive of bodily processes and their significance regardless of field. Similarly, reimagining these concepts requires work of scholars across disciplines. For scientists, it means recognizing the rhetorical character of long-standing conceptual debates, especially the unnecessary rhetoric of “functions” shared by scholars who split sharply over how to identify them. It also means acknowledging the direct and indirect influences of this rhetoric: direct in distorting purported probabilistic reasoning and indirect in abetting an ironically neo-Cartesian evolutionary theory of the mind. For humanists, it means reconsidering the relation between evolutionary theory’s popular and disciplinary versions, as well as between philosophical and empirical disciplines. This kind of work is particularly appropriate to a moment that scholars agree postdates the science wars, for it requires asking not whether experience is biological but instead how to conceive of biology. While this work is incumbent on all who write about embodiment, it matters especially to scholars interested in the evolutionary feminist theory that Grosz envisions, because it helps to avoid terms that can write scholars out of their own conclusions. For such scholars, the implication of this essay is not that we should disengage with evolutionary theory as we study sex and gender but that we should continue to make that engagement more fruitful.</p>
