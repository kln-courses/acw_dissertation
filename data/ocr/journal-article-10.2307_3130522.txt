<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SEVENTH ANNUAL PATRICK ROMANELL LECTURE ON PHILOSOPHICAL NATURALISM Delivered in Atlanta, Georgia on December 29, 1993 at the Eastern Division Meeting of The American Philosophical Association ILL-AT-EASE: THE NATURAL TRAVAIL OF ONTOLOGICAL DISCONNECTEDNESS John J. McDermott Texas A&amp;M University PREAMBLE I am grateful for the honor and privilege of delivering the Annual Patrick Romanell Address. One accepts the invitation with alacrity and then, faced with the task of beginning to compose a text for such an auspicious occasion, insecurity sets in. One soon becomes, as it were, "ill-at-ease." Perhaps, taking a leaf from Kierkegaard, I should address my reader, herewith my listener, a der Einzelner, directly. Given that I have to say something, do I tell you a story, as in Daddy, Grandpa, tell us a story. Which story, little ones? There are so many stories to tell. Tell us the one that has you falling through Grandma's ceiling, plummeting to the floor below startling all of us, most of all, you. Good story, yet too blunt, too crass, and it lacks rhetorical flourish, verbal polish and, so, inappropriate for this occasion. On reflection, most of my stories turn out to be inappropriate for any audience other than a few trusted companioning souls. Well then, how about starting with a text, an epigraph. Such a beginning would provide me and the listener, a sort of locus from which we can eject, or further, such a text would enable each of us to conject. The dreamers among us can traject, playing with their respective fantasies as I speak. The personally intense listeners can render our text a subject or turn it to an "object," as in, I object. And, given that this performance is to be in a philosophical vein, tradition allows that the response individually and even collectively, alas, could be simply to reject. Even though my intended literary lily-pond now seems to be faced with this series of respondent piranha fish, I push on. Ah! the text. Would it not be appropriate to begin with an excision from the Codex of the philosophical tradition on nature, the De Rerum Natura of Lucretius? augescunt aliae gentes, aliae minuuntur, inque breui spatio mutantur saecla animantum et quasi cursores uitai lampada tradunt Book II, 77-791 7</page><page sequence="2">PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES OF THE APA, 67:6 (The nations wax, the nations wane away; In a brief space the generations pass. And like to runners hand the lamp of life One unto other.) How could any start be more salutary than to begin with a text warning of cyclic inevitability, and yet affirming generational continuity, in an affectionate way no less. Still, as soon as I begin to address the meaning of this text by Lucretius, there arises from within me still another ancient text, this from The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. . . life is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn, and after-fame is oblivion. Book II, 172 Surely, these two texts will take us in very different directions, and although moral and spiritual syncretists will find compatibility, I think not. Being torn between them brings to mind still another text, that of St. Augustine, who diagnoses our situation, or is it better called our plight, as one which features an irrequitur cor, a restless heart.3 For Augustine, the ultimate future can be salvific, for we can rest in a "Thee." Yet, for others, such a restlessness reveals what Martin Buber calls "the exalted melancholy of our fate,"4 an oscillation between the poles of the sacred and the profane, between the enhanced and the obvious, a rhythm seemingly natural, intractable. Is this restlessness a harbinger of liberation or is it a malady, endemic to nature, when humanly had, as in you and me? I could, of course render this 'melancholy' in a more terrifying way if I invoked a text of Nietzsche, who warns us that "Since Copernicus man has been rolling from the center toward X."5 He subsequently adumbrates that prophecy by claiming that we are "slipping farther and farther away from the center into-what? into nothingness? into a penetrating sense of his [our] nothingness?"6 Nietzsche's subsequent remark that this sense, "has been the straightest route to-the old ideal"7 is not sufficiently cheering. Consequently, I hark back to the death-bed lament of St. Francis of Assisi who tells us that if he had it to do over, he would have loved brother ass more. Now that is a text with which I can do something. But I shall not!8 Lest I find myself ending at the beginning or beginning at the end, trapped in the circle set for us by the morbidly playful James Joyce of Finnegans Wake, I now make my move. Taking as my spiritual canopy, the jeremiad of John Dewey in Experience and Nature that, in fact, I find myself "living in an aleatory world" and, forthwith my "existence involves, to put it baldly, a gamble,"9 I hereby invoke as my epigraphs three penetrating lines from William James, all found, startingly, in one paragraph: . . . whatever separateness is actually experienced is not overcome, it stays and counts as separateness to the end .... . . . experience itself, taken at large, can grow by its edges ... Life is in the transitions . . 10 8</page><page sequence="3">ROMANELL ADDRESS Epigraph behind me, although it shall surface en passant, I turn now to the text itself. I STARTING IN AND OUT In the periwinkle11 of my life, now into its seventh decade, I am more bemused than mused by its never-ending foibles, dead-ends and broken promises, some of which, alas, are mine. Further, deeper, my response to the phrase of Miguel de Unamuno, "The Tragic Sense of Life," cloaking as it does, irreducibly tragic events, has moved from outrage, to inner rage, to a Jansenist softening brought on by incomprehensibility rather than by any appeal to the dodge of "sub specie aeteritatis." This is not to say that inanition is omnipresent, only frequently so. My determined, life-long attempt to find and absorb nutrition, spiritual and metaphysical nutrition, too often resembles the sidewinder drilling of the stubborn and lonely oil rigs that dot my local Texas landscape, erecting as they do from the acres of blossoming cotton and sorghum plants. In this quest, the experience of joy is epiphenomenal as in a phenomenal epic had fleetingly, occasionally, by me and I suspect, by most of us. Obviously, from the beginning of this journey, seemingly without a terminus ad quem, traveling companions, on occasion, would bite the dust, as did my friend, young Lenihan who was seized by polio at the age of eighteen in 1950, then took to an iron-lung in a brief respiratory respite before expiring, dying that is. Of late, however, and the sad pun is intended, my journeying accomplices are vanishing with a frequency that is foretelling. Only this last July of 1993, did we lose the powerful and abiding presence of R.W. Sleeper. He was a philosophical naturalist of integral marrow and stripe, an authentic Yankee icon, steeped in Emerson and Dewey, who was slain by adeno carcinoma, naturing run wild. I spoke to Ralph on his deathbed as he clutched pieces of an overdue correspondence relative to an obligation for an essay on the thought of John Dewey. Groping through the morphine, palliating and yet a clear sign of his very soon to be demise, he begged me to bail him out. I did, I am and I shall. His last moments with me had him insisting that my wife, Patricia, now view his field of lilies, seen from the window lovingly planted and nurtured so that all of us could have naturing exquisite. Just what then is the significance of the relationship of naturing as carcinomic and naturing as exquisite? Do they need each other as the Manicheans contend? Is this what Spinoza meant by natura naturans and natura naturata, such that the done, the dying, the dead, must follow the doing, the living? I do not know! Still, I must carry on even if only to dally on or to tarry on. So I do. II ILL-AT-EASE It could be that a brief interlude here will be of assistance, namely, just what, in 9</page><page sequence="4">PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES OF THE APA, 67:6 plain style, do I mean by my title, "Ill-at-Ease: The Natural Travail of Ontological Disconnectedness"? Quite simply put, it comes to this. I take as assumptive the direct experiential identity of the quality of our personal sensitivity and the correspondent thickness of our being ill-at-ease. Following the metaphor of Wilhelm Reich, if we did not "armor" ourselves, somewhat, we would find ourselves awash in stimuli far beyond our capacity to absorb. In fact, William James claims that we sensorially filter up to ninety percent of the stimuli which comes at us, so that we rarely hear what we hear, see what we see or touch what we touch. Yet, we tell ourselves of a person or an event, that "there is more there than meets the eye," and we urge ourselves to listen hard so that we "get" all of it. By the way, did you get it?! Nonetheless, there is always something left over or left out and rather than our playing a Stradivarius violin to render the experiential acoustics of our living, we seem more to fiddle around, fiddle with, and in the long-run just fiddle. This mismatch between what we can get, physiologically, and what, in sum, we do get, consciously, causes us to be ill-at-ease, for we are living in a transaction that promises more than it delivers. The "educators" among us say that knowledge will obviate this gap, but knowledge is not Verstehen, and as William James cautioned "knowledge about" often denies immediacy. Rather than acquiring knowledge, the task is to learn how to eat experience, reflectively. When the endemic state of ill-at-ease is given a jolt so that we now have something, for example, cancer, AIDS, or, again recently, tuberculosis, we say that we have a dis- ease. The diagnosis is often frightening, yet the nomination is also often relieving. One thinks here of Alice James, who for many years took to her bed, neurasthenic and hypochondriacal, yet without a proper designation for her being systemically and functionally, ill-at-ease. In May of 1891, she was diagnosed as having terminal cancer of the breast and of the liver. In her Diary of May 31st, she writes: "Ever since I have been ill, I have longed and longed for some palpable disease, no matter how conventionally dreadful a label it might have .... " When informed of her "label," cancer, she tells us that on June 1st of the "enormous relief" of this "uncompromising verdict, lifting us out of the formless vague and setting us within the very heart of the sustaining concrete."12 Alice James knew the difference between ill-at-ease and dis-ease. For her, to be ill-at-ease was far more painful to her person than to be racked with a dis-ease afflicting her body. Try as we might, under the banner of the implacable and determined march of high medical technology, we can only postpone, stem the tide, temporarily detour the inevitable outcome of our disease, whatever it be named along the way. Its real, unchanging name is mortality and medicine notwithstanding, it is natural. Dying is known to us, and we struggle to face it, manage it,. deny it, or shrug it away as but a bad dream. Death, however, is beyond our ken. That, we do not understand. Consequently, the ongoing natural travail of being in the world demands our reflective attention. In my judgment, fed, fueled and sustained by my personal experience, the core of natural travail traces to our being ontologically disconnected. Despite being orthographically and sonorally homely, I use "ontological" rather than the lovely word "metaphysical" because ontology is hard-boiled, of the bottom, and when the stakes are high, I look below. In short, the ontological is what we face, have, when, as we say, all is said and done. Or when queried we look up or look down and say, "I have nothing to say." Is not the fundamental question of ontology that which asks, does it work? When I was a little boy, I would ask my father or my uncles, they of rich and 10</page><page sequence="5">ROMANELL ADDRESS favored memory, if they could fix something. Sometimes it was for them, sometimes for us and sometimes for me-as in just me. Whatever, however, a tire, a wheel bearing on the old Nash, a balky toilet bowl, or most important a crooked bicycle rim in need of "trueing." My question to them was quite simple and direct. Can you fix it? Will it work? If the answer was yes, then a Rara Avis, anticipatory joy and familial pride seeped through my body. More often the answer was that "I do not know" or "we shall see," usually accompanied by the remonstrance, "You have to be patient." Occasionally and dramatically for a little boy, of which in more than one way, I still am, the answer would be no! To which I would say, can we buy a new one, a replacement? No! They do not make them any more and, further, the time being the dark days of the depressioned Thirties, we have no money. Well then, I implored, can you jerry-rig it, just for now, just for today, just for tonight, just for me. Can't you please do something, anything? No! We are licked. It doesn't and it won't work. Now I do not want to rain, excessively and hurtfully, on anyone's rationalizing and self-explanatory parade, yet I must offer that experiential evidence points to the baleful assumption that in so far as our being human naturals, we find ourselves in a situation which, in its most profound sense, does not work. In short, I believe that the being of being is to be disconnected, ontologically adrift, casting a net here, a hook there and all the while confusing a strategy with a solution. I realize that this position runs counter to most of the history of philosophy and virtually all of the history of theology. Also, I am aware that this can be read as a telling departure from the radically empirical, pragmatic metaphysics of James and Dewey. Certainly it would appall those who hold to the conservative metaphysics of Peirce. And, yes, it is Camus who is speaking here, the Camus who wants to know if he "can live with what I know and with that alone" and the Camus who tells us that for him suicide is the "one truly serious philosophical problem."13 More, it is the Camus of the early essays, for whom the naturals of sun, sand and sweat speak for themselves, needing no further raison d'etre. Surely given the living assumption just sketched, it is encumbered upon me to acknowledge that it is but a position, an angle of vision, or better a philosophical trampoline from which I can reach, bounce, gyrate, and perhaps, to which I can return and on which I can intermittently land. It is, of course, given, that like an errant projectile, I miss and splat, just as the eschatologically confident paraders pass me by, moving on to one Vahalla or another. So be it! I never warmed to the Pascalian wager, for to eliminate risk is to die unworthy of the journey. Contrary to the view of most respondents to the above position, namely the contention that philosophically shys away, is chary of, or simply denies even the potential existence of ultimate intelligibility, one does not have to be a lone ranger, a solitary thinker, in order to bring to bear philosophical reflection on the meaning of life. Being a cultural and philosophical historicist, I hold that although it is unquestionably necessary to understand the intentions and conclusions of the historical thinker in the irreducible fabric of his or her cultural setting, it does not follow that one cannot appropriate that wisdom as a way, a Tao, for a cultural setting far different, far removed, as is mine and yours from that of theirs. Thereby, I read the history of philosophy as a long prose poem, evoking the extraordinary, brilliant, provocative and contentious efforts to work out speculatively what does not work experientially, namely, totality, finality, or answers, 11</page><page sequence="6">PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES OF THE APA, 67:6 once and for all. The oft spoken idiom reads "what you see is what you get." Following Kant, for whom everything that is known is known in aliquo modo, I change that idiom to read "what you get is how you see it." The shift from "what" to "how" is both pedagogically and philosophically crucial to the present discussion. If one were to read the history of philosophy as a "how to make sense" rather than "to make sense of a what," we could avoid absolutes of every kind and eliminate the offensive effort of each generation seeking to obsolete its past.'4 Is not this precisely what William James means when he writes "the only meaning of essence is teleological"; in short, essences are "weapons of the mind."l5 Is not this a way to read the Eidai of Plato, the ousia of Aristotle and the essentia of Aquinas? When Darwin entitles his work Origin of Species, that is, the medieval philosophical word species or essentia, are we not being asked to cast an ancient insight into a profoundly different but yet continuous mode of discourse? When I make an effort to teach my grandson, James, how to pick up a contemporary instantiation of Mark Twain's jumping frog, molecular biology, however accurate, is of no help. The problem is clearly resolvable only by a knowledge of some primitive taxonomy. You pick up the frog with a deft placing of your fingers around his legs. That is a "natural" for as long as there have been frogs, which, we are told, has been forever so. Although I do believe there to be "separateness to the end," and I do not believe in the possibility of ultimate intelligibility, nor that in the long run, so far as human naturals are concerned, does it work, I still take as a personal and philosophical obligation to seek ways of coping, ameliorating and understanding in the short run. Beginning here once again, I ask myself what is it for me to be in the world as a natural, that is, as a creature. I take everything that we do, our activities, attitudes, and actions as natural. They may be deleterious, baleful, self-destructive and for a variety of reasons countermanding of one or more assumptions, mores, laws or styles of whatever social and cultural matrix we inhabit. We cannot say with impunity that "anything goes," but we do know that in the eonic history of the kingdom of naturing, at one time or another, for one creature or another everything and anything has "gone." It might help if we were to invoke the basic assumption of both Aristotle and Freud by repeating as a daily mantra, that ineluctably we exist as bodies, as naturals. As I have written elsewhere, "being in the world is not a cakewalk,"'6 although gratefully, it can have its celebratory perturbations and interpolations. If not a cakewalk neither is it for most of us, a walk on the wilding side. Rather, the walk in the world turns out to be mostly a trudge, with occasional interstitial eruptions and an all too habitual tendency to live vicariously through the mediated ersatz reportage of persons and events "in the news," as we are fond of saying. Our lives do not have to be that way and certainly that way is not a Tao. I think here of the opening stanzas of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, wherein he asks of us that we "get at the meaning of poems."17 In response to a question asked by a child, as to "what is the grass," Whitman offers that he does not know and then ruminates on this or that possibility moving from the affectionate "guess" that "the grass is itself a child" to the metaphysical version of the ancient nitrogen cycle of the Stoics, namely, that the grass "seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves."'8 Both hunches seem right to me, and they are reminiscent of our earlier attempt to grasp the hydra-head of naturing. 12</page><page sequence="7">ROMANELL ADDRESS Others come upon us as we walk in the world. Most often the greeting is apparently benign, asking routinely, "how are you?" Actually and strictly speaking, we cannot answer this, for it would involve our telling how it is that we came to be the being who we are or at least think we are. Watch out for that question, the one which we turn on ourselves by asking "who am I?" Have you ever thought about how we walk in and through the world and that it seems less that we are doing the walk and more that we are carrying someone along who is doing. Please notice that I am talking about walking and not about talking. For the most part we own up to our talking but less so to our walking. At times the initiating response of another person to our presence is accosting or dazzling in its recognition. Of the thousands of such greetings, I offer you but two, each symbolically rich as we ferret out the meaning of our journey. The first goes like this: "My God, you look awful." Unless we are clinically and masochistically hypochondriacal our response is immediate, armoring, walling and denying. We say, "who me?" A second and far more cheering greeting of our presence has someone say to us, "Hey there, you with the stars in your eyes." To which we respond coyly, "me?" I trust that both of these encounters are in your existential memory. If the first has not happened to you, the odds are that in time, it will. As for the second, I certainly hope that it happens and happens again and again. I see these little vignettes as instances of experiential neighbors, transacting with us as poles of possibility, ever present, circling around us, penetrating us as if they were a dance of a Texas turkey vulture and a plumed peacock. I take it that this eternal yet not infinite dance was meant by Whitman in his double answer to the child. Once again, we have the oscillation between naturing exquisite and naturing carcinomic. No dead, no grass. So say I to the child. More, listen little one, if you wish to come unto your own, pay attention, look at, think about, both how and where you are taking this walk. Like breadcrumbs in the forest, signs abound to help. Do not forget, however, the warning of Heracitus who as an ancient, reflective dew-line wondered why if the Logos speaks, we are unable to understand.19 Of the many signs extant in this walk of ours, after some painful misreading, I now find three of these signs to be of singular help, to be fortuitous and to be the least capable of miring us in self- deception, the most vaunted and dangerous of our opponents. These signs function integrally for us because they are not clear, in fact they are experiential paradoxes. On this walk, watch then for the sign that announces nature as etherial and beneficent, yet also maleficent. And, also for the one that says spiritual loneliness is the only way to grasp the meaning and the nectar of a journeying community. Third, pay special attention to the surprising admonition that surprises come to those who create situations in which they are welcome. Of course, what I have in mind here are patterns of amelioration, healing en passant. This has nothing to do with ultimate salvation, for such a belief wrecks the possibility of authentic nectaring during our journey. Nor can these signs or any others, of which there are many, totally obviate our being ill-at-ease, for our disconnectedness is ontological and incurable. IV NATURE AS ETHEREAL, BENEFICENT AND MALEFICENT Controverting centuries of received opinion and dogmatic judgment, I offer that the 13</page><page sequence="8">PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES OF THE APA, 67:6 most powerfully prescient work in the history of Christian theology is the Periphyseon of Johannes Scotus Eriugena. Unhappily translated into Latin as De Divisione Naturae and subsequently into English as The Division of Nature, the title indicates a sort of wooden scaffold, a logical schema imposed on the mysterious utterances of the Neo-Platonists and especially Pseudo-Dionysius. Eriugena, however, was not Porphyry, and the Periphyseon is not a logical manifold. To the contrary it is a masterpiece of relational metaphysics, and it long ago tipped me off to the abiding confluence of the Augustinian tradition and the American philosophers of experience and nature, especially Emerson, James and Dewey.20 In Book IV of the Periphyseon, Eriugena speaks of his treatise as "our physiology," and I understand his title to mean "on the phasing of nature," that is a discussion of the contention that everything is in some way everything else, a sort of, shall we say it, perceptual entailment.2' William James would have no difficulty with this physiological metaphysics of Eriugena, for himself a physiologist, James wrote: There can be no difference anywhere that doesn't make a difference elsewhere-no difference in abstract truth that doesn't express itself in a difference in concrete fact and in conduct consequent upon that fact imposed on somebody, somehow, somewhere and somewhen.2 The theological ramifications of this position of Eriugena are quite profound and for many, unsettling, for it leads to what I take should be the orthodox view of Christianity, namely, pantheism. Continuing the parallel, this is also intriguingly close to what William James means by "The Compounding of Consciousness" in his last major work, A Pluralistic Universe23 For Eriugena, the relationship between the created, the uncreated, the creating and the uncreating is bound together by the abiding presence of the Divine Ideas, read by me as reflective energies. Each of these phasings of Nature is entwined with the other such that if one stops speaking, all go silent. Notably, the metaphysical lattice-work invoked by Eriugena is not ontological, that is, in utter, ultimate place but rather in his own word, "physiological," irreducibly organic. What we have here in the Periphyseon of Eriugena is eternal transactional making, chattering, doing and losing. As human naturals we appear, neo-Platonically participate, and then disappear. Hegel was not the first to diagnose our situation in these accurate, albeit for him more morose and baleful terms. In the present context, a more obviously secular vein, I offer that the rhythmic transactions of nature can never be isolated into hierarchies, sheerly negative and positive poles or be had by us in a moral anthropomorphism, as if somehow Nature, writ large, had us in mind. It, he, she does not award us any privileged place. Certainly it is pro forma, especially in an elocutory situation as is the present occasion, to wax eloquent about the plumaging of nature. I, too, have had my fair share of rhapsodic moments when in the presence of natural grandeur, the awesome and the splendidly fey. Coming upon the Rocky mountains for the first time as they jagged their way high, high above the soft, flat plains of eastern Colorado, winding my way around the Grand Tetons, coursing through the allegedly sparse but actually flora-rich Mojave desert and training through the stubborn sluices of the upper Missouri. I have crossed and recrossed the vertebrate of America, our Mississippi, countless times and never fail liturgically to place hands and feet in its unpredictable flow, mostly benign but capable, as we now know, of a savage roiling. Yes, I too, as you, have been present, caught up, 14</page><page sequence="9">ROMANELL ADDRESS done in, amazed, frightened by naturing in its snowing, deserting, oceaning, mountaining, lakeing, fogging, rivering, raining, sunning and mooning. It is doubtless that these comings and goings of naturing frequently have an etherial quality, one which enables us, in an embodied way, to transcend our obviousness, our being sucked into the hum-drum. Such natural events provide adventure to the adventureless. How does it go? A bird on the wing, a furtive cat on the window box, a snake in the sun and the omnipresent urinary lovemaking by a dog to a fencepost. At times our transaction rivets us in a way that is supremely convincing that although we are a natural and equivalently of nature to that of the creatures, still we are, shall we say, at a distinctive disadvantage. I recall having a conversation with a black leopard in the San Diego Zoo. My opening gambit was affectionate, genial and admiring of both her prance and her silky coat. She did not act out, roar or otherwise be unpleasant. This leopard simply looked me in the eye and raised her upperlip, not a snarl and not a waft, just a statement revealing two incisors that meant business. I froze and decided that I shall not invite my leopard to our next dinner party. Still more memorable is the encounter with a black bear in Yellowstone Park. At that instant I learned both the phylastic and experiential difference between a domestic animal and a wild animal. The difference is incalculable and serious, that is, having to do with the genesis of terror. As we are fond of saying, nature has its way, which is something of a quietist natural theology, an attitude of resignation. Of recent vintage, there is much talk of "androcentrism" and its pernicious role in the destruction of our eco-system. No doubt the deep-ecology, "greenie" critique of our long history, now frighteningly rewed to dangerous heights, of our trashing the planetary and even astral environment is on the mark. I caution, however, that this diagnosis is but one side of the debacle. Surely, one has to grant that nature is beneficent and provisionary of our sustenance as human naturals. The frequent experience of nature as etherial awards to this beneficence a still further quality deserving of admiration, affection and historically, even adoration. Once again, however, there is more here than meets the eye, or as my ninety-year old mother has been saying for all of my sixty-two years, he, she (nature) says more than its prayers. If we take at dead-reckoning, as I do, the inevitability of our own death to mean that our future-time prospect is 0, non-existent, then I believe that we must come to grips with nature as also maleficent. How else can we describe a journey in which succulent berries, alternately feed us and poison us. The ocean is truly an etherial phenomenon, yet some of us swim, some of us bob, and some of us drown. Many years ago, traveling through the sunflower state of Kansas, I was taken by the distant appearance of an authentic Dorothy Oz-size tornado. Deeply charred in color, this outburst of naturing was funneling, sporting a seductive tail as it hovered over the land and cityscape, a conical, cyclonic marauder. This image I have before me today as vividly as thirty years ago. I then went on my way, having a storied memory, a romance with nature, safely ensconced elsewhere in its beneficence. Some decades later, the unfortunate souls of the persons of Wichita Falls, in the longhorn state of Texas, also saw a tornado. No romance this time, for the tornado visited with a vengeance, flattening the city and bequeathing carnage of every stripe. We could continue indefinitely with these rotations of meaning when faced with the erupting instances of naturing. How, for example, does the soft rain of an Irish mist become the violent, raging water of the Irish West coast bringing about the endless parade of grieving "Riders to the Sea." Further, is that mist of Ireland behind the monsoonic burial of the people on the coastal edges 15</page><page sequence="10">PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES OF THE APA, 67:6 of Bangladesh? Why is it that at the very same time the Mississippi River rises from its haunching banks, smashing our poor levees, flooding millions of acres of arable, human- sustaining land, Texas croaks in the parched and cracked soil of a drought. Does the Mississippi River and the Texas sun ever have a conversation with each other? Maybe they do; that would be even more worrisome, for then naturing could turn out to be a Cartesian mal genie. Mutatis mutandis, we might cast a similar net of paradox over other imposing dramatis personae of naturing. I have in mind those natural events when undergone on behalf of a human setting, can only be said to have run wild. Under such consideration could be the less than benign arrival of blizzards, hurricanes, volcanoes, visiting meteors and, above all, the sneaky one, earthquake, certainly the most "unsettling" natural disaster of all. (Why, by the way, do we call these eruptings of nature, disasters? Etymologically, at least, the issue is clear, disaster means the activity of a bad, irascible, misbehaving, even nasty star. Does this call for a reworking of our earlier lyric line, "you with the stars in your eyes," so that on occasion we hear, you with the "disaster" in your eyes. Is not that what the Italians mean by the mal occhio, or by those who when steeped in guilt, say, "don't look at me that way!") Let us return to the quixotic threat from under our feet, the stealth bomber that cruises very slowly within the crust of what appears as the solidity of the planet earth, an earthquake. We say that some of us live on top of a "fault," called the San Andreas, the Santa Susana, or the New Madras, among other appellations. Why do we call this situation that results from the restless play of naturing inside our earth a fault? Whose fault is it? Did I do that? Did you do that? Who did that? Own up, whose fault is this fault? Not me! In the above litany of natural disasters, the one which most sustains my claim of our ontological disconnectedness is precisely that of the earthquake. My son David, who was on scene at San Francisco's last major earthquake and is presently an environmental officer with the Peace Corp amid the jungles and volcanoes of the Kingdom of Tonga in the South Pacific, a master ecologist and naturalist, a very tough guy who has lived domestically with tarantulas, water moccasins and a giant boa-constrictor, said to me: "Dad, it was weird! I was scared! I never felt so disconnected." Other interviewees of my acquaintance, even if their experience was only due to tremors, say exactly the same. The opening of the ground under our feet deeply counters our abiding religious and spiritual expectation that our final journey will be up and out, that is, to the above. We feel comfortable with the seemingly seamless garment of the astral, the heavens.24 Contrariwise, to be plunged below as the very grounding of our person drops into the crevice of a renting and rending earth, causes in us the distinctively abject terror of being permanently lost, out of sight, buried alive. I recall as a child that the most vivid and frightening expectation had by me and my childhood friends was to find ourselves in quicksand, which in retrospect has all of the characteristics, softly had, of an earthquake. Suddenly, I hear you say hold it John J. These reports from the fielding of nature are too ominous. Rather, take us for a stroll through the sylphing glen that loafs beneath the high piney woods. Look up and see the early twilight dancing in shafting ribbons deflecting and reflecting a cone, a thistle, a branch and finally an elongated proud trunk. That move is more than fine with me, for I, too, have my share of "biophilia,"25 the term used by Edward 0. Wilson, the leading proponent, ironically, of sociobiology. 16</page><page sequence="11">ROMANELL ADDRESS Unfortunately, however, I am not finished with this philosophical probe into the Janus face of naturing. My earlier admonition about berries succulent and berries poisoning, the pleasing and the nefarious, was not a throw-away line. Pressing it further, the performance of a single berry could be either, both or neither, dependent on which creatures partake, and for that matter dependent as well on a partaking by the same creature in a different state of physiological activity, readiness or lack thereof. William James knows of this possibility when he tells us of "the self-same piece of experience taken twice over in different contexts ... " 26 and when he asserts "There is no property ABSOLUTELY essential to any one thing."7 From this perspective, can we offer another play on the aforementioned idiom, which now turns out to say, "what we get is who we are, at that time." Your time may not be my time, and the berry time may not be the time for either of us. Some berry time may not at any time be for us. It may be curtain time. Should we blame the berries? I do not mean to pick on the berries, nor do I hold that so far as naturing is concerned, we are in the hands of a potential mal genie. Nor do I say here that I believe in the existence of a conscious nature, writ large which means or intends to do us harm. Prior to what John Dewey refers to as the appearing of "warranted assertions" of human "funded experiences," I think it would be accurate to describe and diagnose our natural transaction with nature as initially a form of Russian roulette. The pangs, pains and tragedy of our historically hard-scrabble experience with the things and affairings of nature, as subjected to "creative intelligence," again evoking Dewey, led us to a very careful and cautious inventory of the revolving roulette chambers, looking for those that we can pull with impunity. Slowly, we advanced to those diagnoses of nature's presence that enabled us to pull the chambers on behalf of healing, balming rather than embalming. One thinks here of the roots, plants, bark and yes, even, at least some, of the berries. The strategy of caution and the search for ameliorative naturals lasted until the nineteenth century-in the advanced world that is. At that time we began a program of curing by the method now known as scorching the earth. We started this policy for reasons still difficult to discern. Was it willy-nilly, conspiratorial, ecologically masochistic or merely a lay-over from Original sin. Whichever, whatever possessed us to refill the roulette chambers with live, nasty bullets. A DDT cartridge here, an asbestos blanket there and on through herbicides, pesticides, PCBs, toxins and a canopy of strontium 90. I take the covering word, pesticide, as a metaphor describing the recent "helping" past. Does it not seem strange to use a cide word, for its congeners are extraordinarily dangerous; matricide, patricide, egocide, suicide and ecocide. Quite simply, "cide" means to kill, too often indiscriminately and transiently by "fall-out" or by the subsequent permutations of naturing. I was only thirty when in 1962, a woman wrote something which said to me, John J., you and yours are in for trouble. How so, Miss Carson? It is so because you are facing a Silent Spring.' The discovery of North American DDT in fish residing in the seas which shore the distant Pacific Ocean of the Far East should have taught us that when set into motion, we cannot control the randomness of even well-intentioned ecological violence. What comes to mind here is the execrable but revealing line of the Papal Legate during the Inquisitional crushing of the Albigensees in the early thirteenth century. When asked whether the Catholics should be spared and if so how would we 17</page><page sequence="12">PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES OF THE APA, 67:6 know their identity, his response was chillingly and instructively clear. "Kill them all, for God knows his own."29 Releasing toxins of whatever chemical bonding and for whatever reason, is a no search, yet a destroy mission with the flora and fauna of the planet identical to the hapless believers trapped inside the onslaught directed to the Cathari of Albi in medieval Southern France. Lest these baleful ruminations about the planet earth, inclusive of oceans, ozone layers and other vast natural phenomena, cause the listener to fog over, drift away and self-counsel that this is too much, too big and not my existential affair, I turn to closer, more intimate quarters. More than a decade ago, when confronted with the sudden erupting of naturing in a frightening way, namely, the presence of gynecological cancer in the body of a deeply loved one, I took to finding out how this went, what was up so to speak. Learning the then used nomenclature of malignancy, or is it the malignant nomenclature of our fate,30 I came to know the stages on cancer's way; dysplasia, severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and metastasis, the last one signaling fatality. I innocently asked the oncologist, himself brilliant, caring and a superb gynecological surgeon, why did not our bodies, specifically our fighting and protecting cells, come to the rescue as these stages progressed, from the dysplasing, that is misbehaving cells to the roaming killer cells of metastasis? Were our good cells overmatched? No, he answered. It appears rather that they lay out, that is, they do not seem to give a damn. I found this contention to be quite remarkable, and I pondered its implications for many years. At first, I had great difficulty in squaring my romantic view of naturing and my abiding trust in the good will of our bodies with the now obvious presence of human cells variously described as "wise guys," lazy, indifferent, cowardly, hapless or adolescently petulant. This disquiet within me lasted for several years until I came upon the far more disquieting yet clarifying phenomenon of HIV, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, known globally as AIDS, the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.31 Simply put, a virus, originating in Latin as a slimy liquid or poison, is an organism composed mainly of nucleic acid within a protein coat and it acts differently at each of two stages in its life cycle. In the one stage, the virus is free and infectious and does not carry out the functions of other living cells. In the other stage, the virus enters a living organism, whether it be plant, animal or a bacterial cell and then makes use of the host to replicate itself. That appears quite straightforward and helps us to understand the studied, repetitive vagueness of that frequent and frustrating medical diagnosis; "you probably have caught a virus." To which diagnosis is usually added the attempted healing phrase, '"wait it out" and the efforted conflicting remark, "it is going around." This latter piece of information tries to create a passive community brought together by the presence of the communicable. It was never clear to me when given these personal, family and especially childrenic diagnoses that such uninvited visitations of our viral neighbors constituted the presence of a disease. But then has that not been the lineage of long- standing diagnostic punting, found over and over in answer to our plaintive complaint, "I feel lousy." The "diagnosis" comes in as "you have a cold" (the single most mysterious word in the English language) or subsequently, it is probably the flu, and recently, its a virus, "they" say it is "around."32 The arrival of the AIDS virus has put an end to any innocence that we might still have with regard to the embattled character of our entwining with the affairings of nature. The AIDS virus has two distinctively distressing and, as it turns out, deadly 18</page><page sequence="13">ROMANELL ADDRESS characteristics. First, its coat is a masquerade, blinding us to both its early presence and its intentions. Strictly speaking, as of the present (1994), I should not use the singular for this virus and its misleading coat, for we now know of at least six variations of the viral presence, of which at this time, we test only for one. The second characteristic of the AIDS virus is that its docking place is in those very blood cells, the T cells, which have been called out to repel and destroy the intruder. Too late! The AIDS virus penetrates the membrane of the T cell, then takes off its coat and goes to work, by subverting our T cells in many nefarious ways, only one of which is the final destruction of the T cell itself. Replicating itself, the AIDS virus seditiously produces aberrant host cell behavior, soon to generate dangerous pathologies. In time, our T cells drop from many hundreds (as measured in absolute numbers of cells per volume of blood) to below 200 and finally, into "double digits" as the pronouncement is made on behalf of the presence in the patient of "full-blown AIDS." I have visited with a dying AIDS patient who had but six T cells, as measured above, still functioning. He died within that week. Now if we hold up here for a brief reflective time and think of this disease anthropomorphically, which is the only way that I know how to think, it turns out something like this. Somehow, somewhere, somewhen, someway, this virus shows up, and it turns out to be a con-man. Further, this conning, clnning virus figures out just how to accomplish its mission of destruction by choosing the entry to our bloodstreaming bodies that is the second most frequented, the second most needed and most tellingly the one which is fraught with the energy of headless passion, namely, the orificial openings of human sexuality. Only the mouth, the opening for nutrition takes precedence in frequency, but it has the major advantage of controlling that which enters and even has alternatives for entering, for example, intravenously. To the contrary, the sexual entrances are circumscribed, proscribed and without alternatives. Is it possible that our AIDS virus remembers its Latin and works off the phrase "occasio furem facit" (opportunity makes the thief)? Further, upon entry, this con-man has the venal foresight to cut the phone line, dismantle the burglar alarm and force its hosts into a process by which they victimize themselves, a claim sustained by recent scientific investigation, which contends it is precisely the response of our immune system that drives the AIDS virus from its hosting cover and sets it free for maleficent activity. As Hegel once said of history and as is now said of alcoholism, the major diagnostic word here is-cunning. Does it occur to you that what we have described here is not a fair fight? Does it not seem apparent that this conflict is not taking place on a level playing field? In fact is not this playing field in reality a killing field, hosted by none less than ourselves? I think that the answer to each of these questions is a lachrymose yes! I think also that whatever comes of the battle against AIDS, it is clear that the meaning of nature is not on a priori terms, beneficent. Rather, as we say of else, it all depends. A time ago, when adoring one of my six grandchildren, this one Damon, then age 5, I queried rhetorically and publicly, I wonder what his future will bring? His father, my son-in-law, a physician of note, answered dourly and resignedly that Damon's only problem will be to reach age forty without falling victim to AIDS. When I was little, I did not think that way. When my five children were little, none of us thought that way. What is it to think that way? 19</page><page sequence="14">PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES OF THE APA, 67:6 v LONELINESS The upshot of what I have offered here thus far is that when all is said and done, when the bread is baked, the car is fixed, the plane arrives and whoever says yes to one deep, pleading question or another, I am still, ontologically alone. For me, to be alone, to experience systemically my self-consciousness as implacably one of loneliness is not to evoke the geometric method, nor is it to be trapped in a "spatial metaphysics" so incisively deprecated by Maurice Blondel. I am not referring to loneliness or describing loneliness as "being alone," as one, as only one, with no one else near and hereby. Rather than holding loneliness to be the result of absenting, of something gone or as not having come, I see loneliness as a palpable, thick, even aggressive presence in each of our personal worlds, in short, the personal space of our embodied, yet ontologically disconnected selves. Actually, if we were to be self-diagnostically honest (no small feat, that), I believe that we would own up to the presence of the Augustinian irrequitur cor as omnipresent and incurable.33 Obviously, we are not without our resources, strategies of coping, cleaning, placing, making, fixing, changing, rendering aesthetically, observing, cataloguing and moves desperate, searching for a hook, hoping for a reef, a landfall, a preserver or best of all a friend, a trustworthy friend. Do you have a friend? The etiology and morphology of the AIDS virus taken as symbolic of the wider fabric of naturing has sustained my hunch that our being-in-the-world is a masterpiece of attempting to overcome our melancholy fate, one stated baldly as follows: having evolved to being human naturals, we now find that we do not belong, we are ontologically homeless. There may be a naturing reason for this situation, but I rather think that Camus has it right: "Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is."34 If that is so, and I believe it to be so, then my suggestion is that we relocate our point of departure. Instead of coming to consciousness under the assumption that we "belong" and have to deal with things and events that go awry, we proceed rather under the assumption that we do not belong and therefore must work to make the best of our situation, such that things and events will here, there, sometime and somewhere be celebratory, occasions for joy. In this vein, the diagnosis would run something like this. We do not fit into the world as a Lego or a Lincoln Log. In fact, I believe that we have no special place in the organic constituency of nature. Our consciousness, so different, so extraordinary, so bizarre, especially in its dream state, is a marvelous and pockmarked perturbation of the eonic history of DNA. Following Dewey, we are in, of, and about nature.35 We are nature's creature, its consciousness, its conscience, however miscreant and quixotic; its organizer, namer, definer, and defiler; a transient in search of a needful, probably unrealizable, final consummation. The human organism is surrounded, permeated, and contexted by both the natural and social environment. In speaking of William James's doctrine of the self as a relational manifold, John E. Smith writes, "Radical empiricism is a radically new account of how the self penetrates and is penetrated by the world."36 This penetration is not without its rhythmic threats as John Dewey warns: Man finds himself living in an aleatory world; his existence involves, to put it baldly, a gamble. The world is a scene of risk; it is uncertain, unstable, 20</page><page sequence="15">ROMANELL ADDRESS uncannily unstable. Its dangers are irregular, inconstant, not to be counted upon as to their times and seasons. Although persistent, they are sporadic, episodic. It is darkest just before dawn; pride goes before a fall; the moment of greatest prosperity is the moment most charged with ill-omen, most opportune for the evil eye. Plague, famine, failure of crops, disease, death, defeat in battle, are always just around the corner, and so are abundance, strength, victory, festival and song. Luck is proverbially both good and bad in its distributions. The sacred and the accursed are potentialities of the same situation; and there is no category of things which has not embodied the sacred and the accursed: persons, words, places, times, directions in space, stones, winds, animals, stars.37 The way in which the human self abides in the world is an extraordinarily complex affair. The self projects itself into the world. The self constructs a personal world, a habitation.3 The self, when threatened, retreats, even attempts to eject from the world, a form of dropping out. The rhythm of these transactions is often lost in the macroscopic setting of getting through the day. The algorithmic subtleties of our movements, shifts in attitude, and construction, deconstruction, setting, shifting, and bypassing of barriers are often buried in the frequently graceless syntax of duties, obligations, and habituations. So typical are our routines that the virtually infinite number of plans, plots, and variations in the rhythm of our bodily movements are lost to our attention. Recent investigations in biochemistry, especially in the human liver and in cell surface and molecular biology, reveal an utterly amazing transacting network. The electron microscope has revealed a dazzling array of complexity in an endless chain of relationships. The human skin is a battleground of bacteria colonies, symbiotic, voracious, and with long memories, as found in the unerring recurrence of dermatitis, repeatedly appearing on an isolated finger or toe, over and again.39 The embodied happenings of the everyday, our affectings, skinnings, dreamings, some comforting, some discomforting, allow us to feel connected, or at least so we tell ourselves. Yet, should we come at our loneliness from the back-side, that is, our missings, the truth may out. To miss is to be lonely-to be alone even-perhaps more so-in a crowd. It is to be without, to be adrift while yet stationary. For us, when lonely, it is as if "I can't get started," I cannot get it together, and I have a pervasive sense of separateness, of disconnectedness. I am out of place, I am no place, I am nowhere, I am no-body, no-one, although as seen by others, I am here, there. That they see me whereas I do not see myself gives me an eerie pain of discomfort. Not only is something, someone missing, but I am missing from myself as others have me. To miss is to be in a state of spiritual hunger. It is not so much that we do not have personal food, as that the food for us, is not nutritional. Or again, still more baleful the spiritual food we have is potentially nutritious, but we do not have the capacity to make the conversion. We may eat the world and yet are not sated. We become more of a viaduct than an organism. That is why we seek company, etymologically, to be with bread, the stuff, the staff of life of nutrition. We may receive nutrition from flora and fauna, the bugs, the birds, the animals, the ferns, the weeds, the water-always the water-in which we frolic, into which we dive, for fun, for alleged mastery, for suicide. The water which feeds us, calms us, frightens us, drowns us-the water as deep, as grave and as a grave, as a home for creatures, strange, mysterious and 21</page><page sequence="16">PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES OF THE APA, 67:6 now in a temporary halt, recession, but someday to wash over us, to wash us away, to take us back to our first home, the uterine fluids of our mother. Further, although we do not seem to be aware in the same way, systemic loneliness is due also to the separation from our things. Such a separation is obviously severe when it is spatial as in our things are somewhere else or tragically when we are ripped from them as we are forced to flee. Yet more subtly, it can also be severe when we are still in the presence of our things if we do not let them speak to us or if when they speak, we shut them off and refuse to hear their comforting words.40 As with all human experiences, our loneliness finds itself wrapped around a time- space matrix. For most, time and space are taken as naturals, fabricial to the very meaning of nature. Following Immanuel Kant, and may I add, modern physics, I demur. Rather, time and space are imposed human constructs by which we live our mortal, emboxed natural lives. Nonetheless, whatever may be the potentially resolute physics and metaphysics of this matter, I believe that the following phenomenological diagnosis holds. Is the space I am "in," my space (as in being someplace), my place, or is the space alien space? The same space can be comforting and alien dependent on its peopling (as in a hotel after a convention-the loss of faces, community, common endeavor, bonds assumed without having to be publicly articulated); or when the space is transformed by light or lack thereof, sound, smell; when the space is mobile as in an automobile or a train, constantly visited by shifts, some dramatic, some prosaic, all telling such that my experience of my present space is a flighting, a process, forcing me to claim and reclaim my place in this ever-changing space, despite its apparent stasis. The domestication of space, as in a hotel room, a picnic ground, a shelter, a long train or bus ride, tells of our ability to build any thing and every thing into our bodies such that it, they, become aspects of our inner, personal space. The inability to domesticate our space, to turn it into an embodied personal place, is a sign of severe, unwanted disconnectedness, and it foretells our experience of loneliness no matter where we are or what is happening around us, by us, or to us. I would extrapolate even further and claim that to be simply in and of the world is to be able to participate in a panoply of shifting spatial contours, facades, depths, alleys, heights, and reaches. Loneliness appears when this panoply fades into a sameness resulting in the irony that the absence of difference thereby structures not recognition (habituation in any positive sense) but rather bequeaths an aloneness, a dried-up desiccated, second-hand person, alone with himself or herself. The second matrix in and through which we live, move and have our being is time, the inevitable source of our erosion and the harbinger of our death, our dismissal from the journey. To escape from this insistent, persistent presence which appears in micro- seconds, we adopt strategies, all of which cut us off from nutrition and are contrary to the salvation we seek. All too often, we find ourselves in one bunker or another, and once again, despite our best effort, lonely. For example, some of us retreat to a vicious nostalgia, whereby the past takes on a glow that it never had in the present and seduces us into living our lives backwards. Increasingly the present loses its reality, and we become tied to a chimera with our experiences being lived both vicariously and by hindsight. When we are reminded of the unreality of our nostalgia, we become defensive and further enlarge our dependence on a past which never happened and which prevents us experiencing our own present. In effect, we have dropped out and back, isolating us from continuous nutrition and trapping us in a world that cannot be understood or shared by anyone else. We become our own glass menagerie. 22</page><page sequence="17">ROMANELL ADDRESS Some others of us deny the call of the present by entering into the seduction of a projected future, laced with the deep although most often unrequited nostrum that things will get better. In the meantime, we either hunker down waiting for forces other than our own to propel us or even to rescue us, or we tint every experience with its alleged future-time prospect, in the hope, most often vain, that things will (must?) get better. In both strategies, the present has no feet, no past, for that disappears into a redeeming albeit vague future. And, further, the power of the present, the existential moment has no bite, for we are always waiting for something else, something different, something better-a wait which is futile, for only the experience of the present can lead to a viable future. And now we understand why the great originating antique cultures believed in the cycle, historical and natural. If everything which goes around, comes around, then all of the existential worries that I lamentably describe herein, become vapid, a no-go, of no existential import. Is not this the proffered personal peace of the Tao te Ching as given to us by Lao-tzu?41 In all of our previous remarks, especially those which diagnose our spatial and temporal context, the danger is involuntary disconnectedness. To disconnect voluntarily is not to be lonely, for in such a decision, we affirm the process most congenial, and the forced absence is on behalf of our building, kneading, constructing and creating. Conversely, to be disconnected without our personal approbation is to risk self-deception as to the worth of that with which we are left. The message here is that loneliness is a given, it is our ontological state of being human. We must fight it by forging contexts, situations and attitudes, each of which opens us to possibilities not given to simply being here or there. I do not accept the scholastic philosophical maxim that actus sequitur esse. Sed contra, I offer that in and through our relating, our experiencing is no less than who we are. As human naturals, we must listen carefully and warily to both the consonant and dissonant voices of naturing. We are both fed and destroyed by nature. The natural rhythm for being in the world is more akin to a roller coaster than to a hammock. At the very least, we should watch for what is behind our back, whether it be bacterial, viral or cyclonic. VI SURPRISE Do not fret. This is but the voice of one turtle. All is not lost. There may be gold in them 'thar' hills. Surprises abound, if we make ready for them by trimming our system of denial.42 It is, after all, the philosophical logician and scientist, par excellence, C.S. Peirce, who tells us that "Experience is our only teacher" and then adds "how does this action of experience take place? It takes place by a series of surprises."43 And so, the dolorous phrase, what's next, could also be a harbinger of juvenescence, of song, of fragrance and of healing experiences. When the little ones say to me, what's next Grandpa, I intone the lyrics of Ray Bolger, sung on behalf of being "once in love with Amy." "Someday, there will be horseless carriages and stereopticans that fly." That someday is today and as for tomorrow, on the morrow, I hope to see you around the block. 23</page><page sequence="18">PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES OF THE APA, 67:6 ENDNOTES 1. T.

Another penetrating and increasingly widespread experience of the potential relief which comes with the announcement of a 'disease' as replacement for an ongoing malady, occurs over and over at First-step meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. Here the awareness must be self-announcing, consequently enhancing the nightmare by an extensive quotient. If one were to go to their first meeting and say, my name is John, and I am an alcoholic, the immediate inner sense is one of disbelief, guilt, shame and terror. Yet, riven inside those feelings exists also a profound sense of relief for one now has a real disease at last, and the trap of the malady has a door, albeit still stuck by denial and covered by the physiology of DNA.

This helpful distinction is found in Patrick Romanell, John Locke and Medicine (Buffalo: Prometheus Books, 1984), p. 67. 33. It is of note that for several decades we have attempted to transform the presence of ill-at-ease by means of a pill-at-ease. Known in the trade as anti-depressants, these psychotropic drugs are on behalf of a distinct interpretation of human naturals, such that 26</page><page sequence="21">ROMANELL ADDRESS the key to well-being resides in the biochemistry of the neural transmitters. My language of relations, connections and disconnections is also the language of neural pharmacology, now the dominant tactic of psychiatry. Some psychiatrists even talk of "remaking the self." cf. Peter D. Kramer, Listening to Prozac (New York: Viking, 1993). The philosophical significance of pharmacological psychiatry begs to be addressed. 34. Albert Camus, The Rebel (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1954), p. 17. 35. cf. John Dewey, Experience and Nature, The Later Works, op. cit., I, pp. 12-13. "These commonplaces prove that experience is of as well as in nature. It is not experience which is experienced, but nature-stones, plants, animals, diseases, health, temperature, electricity and so on." 36. John E. Smith, "The Course of American Philosophy," Themes in American Philosophy: Purpose, Experience and Community (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1970), p. 135. 37. John Dewey, Experience and Nature, op. cit., p. 43. 38. Martin Buber sees this quest for habitation as having alternate success, epochally. I see it as both personal and epochal. cf. Martin Buber, Between Man and Man, (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1947), p. 126. "In the history of the human spirit I distinguish between epochs of habitation and epochs of homelessness. In the former, man lives in the world as in a house, as in a home. In the latter, man lives in the world as in an open field and at times does not even have four pegs with which to set up a tent." What would Buber say of that scabrous contemporary American phenomenon, the homeless among the urban (urbane?) crowd. 39. This diagnosis of our "place," rests on an earlier essay, "Experience Grows by Its Edges," Streams, op. cit., pp. 142-148. 40. We should not underestimate the profound symbolic significance of the social fact that the "bag ladies," forerunners of the now pandemic urban homeless, carried their "things" everywhere and had as a mooring, no place, but only and rather, their "things." 41. Tao te Ching, trans. Stephen Mitchell (New York: Harper and Row Publishers, 1988). 42. Often our battle, the personal fight is waged deep within our heart, where resides a Binnenleben, that region described by William James as the one in "which we dwell alone with our willingness and unwillingness, our faiths and our fears." William James, "Is Life Worth Living," in The Will to Believe, The Works, op. cit., p. 55. My version of this central question can be found in John J. McDermott, "Why Bother: Is Life Worth Living? Experience as Pedagogical," in Philosophy and the Reconstruction of Culture, ed. John J. Stuhr (New York: State University of New York Press, 1993).
