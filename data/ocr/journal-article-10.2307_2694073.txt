<plain_text><page sequence="1">PICOSA: THE ELEMENTARY SOUTHWESTERN CULTURE CYNTHIA IRWIN-WILLIAMS ABSTRACT Picosa is defined as a continuum of similar closely related preceramic cultures existing in the southwestern United States during the last three millennia before Christ. It is seen as representing the elementary period of the development of the Southwest as a discrete culture area and is believed to be the result of a cultural synthesis of uniform developments originating as early as 8000 B.C. Although similar to the Desert culture in a culture-typical sense, the Picosa is distinct in terms of detailed inventory and historic derivation. Its role as the progenitor of most of the ceramic period cultures of the Southwest is examined. BASIC information concerning large-scale late preceramic development in the Southwest has long been scattered in source and disunited in theoretical structure. In the course of studies on preceramic Southwestern intrusions into cen- tral Colorado, and with the hope of subsequent- ly providing a context for research on Anasazi origins, a synthesis of available material on pan- Southwestern late preceramic development was undertaken. The results of this synthetic at- tempt are embodied in the present discussion. It should be recognized that these outlines are presented as, and should be considered, work- ing hypotheses, guidelines for further research, rather than fixed schemata based on compre- hensive data. Students have long been in agreement that the Southwest is a culture area possessed of considerable time depth. Although considera- tions of this kind are usually limited to the ceramic period, several outlines, including those of Martin and Rinaldo (1951) and Daifuku (1952), attempt to include earlier, if then little known, periods. Despite subsequent criticism of the former for lack of methodological rigor in their application of the co-tradition concept to the Southwest (Rouse 1954), the remarkable unity of large-scale Southwestern development through time remains unquestionable. Since these papers were written, new evidence rele- vant to the present discussion has accumulated in several areas of inquiry and must be taken into account: (1) increasing, though still rare, data on horticulture in the preceramic period; (2) the growing knowledge that the western Arizona-southeastern California Hakataya area must be formally included in considerations of the Southwest; (3) new data on preceramic Anasazi origins; (4) new information on the preceramic sequences in southern California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. On the basis of the available information there is abundant evidence that the entire Southwest was occupied by a broad continuum of related cultures for at least two to three millennia be- fore the Christian era. Briefly the materials con- forming to the basic pattern are those included in the Pinto-Amargosa complexes of California, southern Nevada, and western Arizona; the Chiricahua and San Pedro phases of the Cochise culture of southeastern Arizona and southwest- ern New Mexico; and the wide range of rather poorly known materials grouped as San Jose, Lobo, Santa Ana, and Atrisco from northwest- ern New Mexico, adjacent northeastern Arizona, southeastern Utah, and central and southwest- ern Colorado. The spatial coverage represented by these materials comprises the geographical areas of Arizona, western New Mexico, adjacent sections of Chihuahua and Sonora, southeastern California, southern Nevada, southeastern Utah, and portions of southwestern and central Colo- rado. It is evident that this spatial unit com- prises most of the "Southwestern culture area" as known from more recent materials, plus cer- tain isolated territories now conforming to other patterns. The units of this cultural continuum derive from a broad spectrum of shared features, gen- eral and specific, and from parallelism of struc- tural development through time. The import of this unity is that the origins of the Southwest in its role as a culture area can be traced direct- ly back to cultural syntheses in the third millen- nium before Christ. This then is the earliest point in the prehistoric record in which the Southwest comprises a cultural entity whose synchronic internal consistency is sufficient to distinguish it from contemporary and contigu- ous entities of the same kind. Its internal tem- poral and spatial developmental structure is similar in basic structure to those considered by Martin and Rinaldo (1951) to constitute a co- tradition. In point of fact these early internal dynamics may be seen to foreshadow later developments (see below). 441</page><page sequence="2">442 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 32, No. 4, 1967 In treatment of the Southwest as a culture area with great time depth, this preceramic continuum is seen to constitute the "initial" or "(elementary" unit, in contradistinction to later units variously described as "developmental," "formative," "fluorescent," etc. In the present discussion the already established term "ele- mentary" has been employed to refer to this earliest period of Southwestern unity. In an earlier version of this paper the same term was also used to refer to the cultural continuum itself. However, the awkwardness of the usage and the problem of certain special connotations stemming from Daifuku's original article (Dai- fuku 1952) caused it to be limited to the devel- opmental-period reference. A new term to refer to the distinctive cultural entity occupying this spatio-temporal niche was evidently needed. Rather than pilfer the ethnic vocabularies of the Southwest for another word for "ancestors," the acronym Picosa, derived from certain of the major relevant archaeological units (Pinto Basin, Cochise, San Jose), was adopted. The nature of the prehistoric ethnographic entity involved is evidently the total cultural content of a large culture area with time depth. Its character, as noted, is very much like that termed "co-tradition" by Martin and Rinaldo (1951) for later developments in the ceramic cultures of the Christian era. In view of the relative rigidity of that term in its original defi- nition, however, the more flexible and seman- tically less complicated term "culture" is em- ployed with the Picosa referent. LEVELS OF ANALYSIS It is desirable at the outset to deal briefly with the community of traits or patterns which char, acterize the Picosa continuum. However, for an accurate understanding of the conceptual model or of any synthetic model of this kind, it cannot be too strongly emphasized that analysis and synthesis must take place on two distinct ana- lytic levels. Level I is essentially integrative: It serves to recognize traits and patterns which are common to both the conceptual model under discussion and to certain other models of the same kind. Its functions are synthetic, and its essential orientation is toward the recognition of similarities and regularities. Culture units produced are primarily culture-typical, or only remotely culture-historic, in nature. Level 11 is isolative: It serves to recognize traits and pat- terns which distinguish the conceptual model at hand from other models of the same kind. Its functions are analytic, and its orientation is toward the recognition of dissimilarities and irregularities treated in a causal or historic framework. Units created tend to be strongly culture-historic in nature. In the present context, Level I comprises fun- damental widespread traits and patterns, fre- quently linked to the ecology of the temperate or semidesert Southwest, or common to most of North American cultures at an "Archaic" level of organization. The mechanisms producing the parallels noted are principally those of ecologic adapta- tion, and of generalized low-level diffusion of such an early and nonspecific nature as to be essentially untraceable. Level II comprises those patterns and traits whose distribution is specific to or particularly characteristic of the South- west, which derive chiefly from the special definable culture history of the area, and which serve to distinguish the Southwest from other contemporary and contiguous culture areas. In the treatment of a large-scale unit of pre- ceramic Southwestern culture history such as the Picosa, there is no question but that data from both levels must be employed. However, operationally the distinction of the two must be maintained, and data from one should not be used in functions of the other. Certainly the greatest danger threatening the validity of cur- rent attempts at preceramic synthesis is precisely the failure to distinguish between these two analytic frameworks and the resultant equation of comparative data from the two. In a treat- ment of the community of traits and patterns which characterize the Picosa, every effort should be made to distinguish between data on Level I and Level II. THE PICOSA CULTURE Demography. The basic population of the Southwest during this elementary period was probably rather sparse, but variable, and at cer- tain seasons may have included groups of 30 or more individuals. Favored locations for Picosa settlement include caves and rockshelters, lake shores, and level terrain near springs and streams. The nature of this portion of the demo- graphic pattern is evidently linked to nonspe- cific causation, reflecting the available natural resources and the general level of exploitative technology. Still rather general, but tied to somewhat more specific Southwestern land</page><page sequence="3">IRWIN-WILLIAMS ] PICOSA 443 forms, are sites representing seasonal mountain hunting camps, camps on plant-rich sand dunes, in alluvial valleys, and on low mesa tops near water sources. Not limited to the Picosa, but certainly characteristic of it, are certain camp features such as refuse middens, indicating con- tinuity of occupation, and small burned rock middens left from food processing activities (dis- tinct from the much larger burned rock mid- dens of the southern Plains). Dwellings. Evidence of artificial dwellings is difficult to obtain, but these may ultimately be of considerable significance as a culture-histor- ical indicator. Circular configurations of post holes, suggesting simple pole-and-brush con- struction, are known early in the Picosa period (Stahl site, California). Somewhat later struc- tures uncovered at Hay Hollow (Arizona) and at Sandoval Spring (New Mexico) are roughly circular, with rudimentary entranceways and sometimes slightly depressed floors (Martin, per- sonal communication, 1966). Limited evidence from the San Pedro Cochise likewise indicates a structure constructed over a slight depression. Subsistence. The fundamental subsistence pattern in the Southwest as elsewhere in the West at this time was one of intensive exploita- tion of local resources. Despite considerable local variation in emphasis on hunting or gath- ering, both pursuits were evidently universal. There are growing indications of ordered and relatively sophisticated seasonality of movement geared to the maturation and availability of natural resources. (Significant, probably sea- sonal, differentiation of site pattern and tool kit has been noted in northwestern New Mexico.) The one subsistence feature which sets the Southwest Picosa area off from all contempo- rary western Archaic cultures is the early pres- ence and growing importance of horticulture. Probably introduced through the medium of the Cochise culture, its occurrence by about 2000 B.C. is documented in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado (Cienega Creek, Arizona, Haury 1957; Bat Cave, New Mexico, Dick 1965; Armi- jo Shelter, New Mexico, Irwin-Williams 1967a; LoDaiska Shelter, Colorado, Irwin and Irwin 1959). It is not impossible that knowledge of horticulture spread into the more favorable por- tions of western Arizona and southern Califor- nia as well, but evidence is lacking. Initially the importance of domesticated plants in the diet was probably very limited. Their significance lies rather in (1) the necessity of restriction of annual movement, resulting in the creation of an annual base, and (2) the creation of the potential for further sedentarism. Burial Practices. Burial customs for this period are very poorly known with primary interment in rockshelters a very generalized trait. The rare scattered examples of secondary interment un- der stone cairns, however, may represent a sig- nificant pattern (Stahl site, California, Harring- ton 1957; Apex complex, Magic Mountain site, Colorado, Irwin-Williams and Irwin 1966). A single, very late, example of cremation in a deep pit may or may not reflect a widespread or regional pattern (Haury 1957). Grave goods, where present, seem to be of a simple functional nature. Ornamentation. Ornamentation and decora- tion are likewise unimportant or little known. The use of red ochre as a pigment is a wide- spread Archaic trait. Bone, shell, or stone beads or pendants are rare. One anthropomorphic engraving has been recovered (Irwin-Williams and Irwin 1966). Typology and Technology. Predictably, the most specific and reliable data on a historico- genetic (Willey and Phillips 1958) level proceed from an examination of the artifact inventory of Picosa sites. The best represented classes of tools are those of chipped and ground stone. Selection of materials to be knapped appears to have varied both spatially and temporally. Tech- niques of manufacture vary similarly between emphasis on percussion and pressure flaking. Specific tool types vary with time and space, but they may be reduced to certain meaningful sys- tems: Distributional configurations reflect a pattern of function-oriented types conforming closely to regional ecology, overlain by historico- genetic types reflecting culture-historical devel- opment and large-scale communication on a stylistic level. Among the most common tools are specific forms of heavy planes and choppers characteristic of the southern and western sec- tors (see below), and distinctive flake side scrap- ers and thick end scrapers typical of the north- ern regions. Bifacially worked implements other than projectile points are rare in most areas until rather late in the Picosa period. The projectile point class itself is widely recognized as providing the most sensitive spatio-temporal data for nonceramic cultures. Projectile point typology is organized around early and late type- systems (discussed in detail below); (1) Pinto-</page><page sequence="4">444 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 32, No. 4,1967 San Jose, and Chiricahua, Pelona; (2) San Ped- ro, Amargosa, Santa Ana, Atrisco, Lobo, etc. Although ground stone is perhaps intrinsically a somewhat less sensitive medium, careful anal- ysis reveals numerous features of culture-his- torical significance. Ground stone implements occur almost universally on Picosa sites, but relative importance varies considerably accord- ing to area, period, and seasonal derivation. Cer- tain forms of handstone, such as the one-handed "rocker" type, occur almost as widely and are characteristic of the Southwest. The typology of the common flat or shallow-basined grinding slab has received little attention, but it is evi- dently amenable to detailed analysis (Irwin- Williams and Irwin 1966). Certain less common forms such as the mortar and pestle may like- wise ultimately be of diagnostic significance. The worked-bone class is poorly represented and evidently not highly developed. The most common forms include awls of split or whole medapodia (but not the L-shaped scapula type), generalized flat spatulate objects, rare beads, and "projectile points." Little evidence is available in the undoubtedly large inventory of perishable artifacts, known only from a few scattered sites (Bat Cave, Tu- larosa Cave, Jemez Cave). Many of the classes probably present throughout the elementary period are generalized in nature (fur-and-feather cloth, fiber netting, sandals, cordage, atlatls, leather bags, fire-making implements); but with a larger sample they may yield a more distinc- tive typology. The basketry, principally coiled, is already somewhat more diagnostic. Several traits, such as gourd vessels, cane cigarettes (may be specifically southern), reed flutes, wooden hoops, scoops, "tablitas" and "pahos," which are of possible historico-genetic significance, are known only late in the elementary period, but they may have long developments. In summary, data on the Picosa culture as treated above conform to the two levels of analysis defined. Typical of Level I are traits which derive from the ecologic position of the area and from the general level of technology which qualify the Picosa materials for inclusion in the general rubric "Archaic." These include a sparse population; exploitation of wild plant and animal resources; seasonal demographic shifts; location of some typical sites (caves, lake- shores, springs); the use of chipped and ground stone, bone and wood, etc., for implements; the use of atlatls, clubs, and fire-hearths; the use of fur-and-feather cloth, cordage, sandals, bags, and baskets. Level II comprises those traits which derive from the culture history of the Southwest and its special geographic position and which serve thereby to differentiate the Southwest from contemporary and contiguous culture areas. Included in this level are certain demographic patterns, such as specialized sites on sand dunes and mesa tops; numerous site features; the very important knowledge and development of horticulture as a subsistence technique; the use and parallelism in evolution of certain specific types of artificial dwelling; and the probably widespread pattern of disposal of the dead under stone cairns, and possibly secondary late local use of crematory pits; a widespread range of specific historico-genetic artifact types in chipped and ground stone, in- cluding diagnostic forms of projectile points, knives, scrapers, "planes," handstones, etc.; nu- merous, though poorly known, specific forms (not general classes) of perishable items, such as coiled basketry, gourd vessels, possibly "tabli- tas," "pahos," etc. THE PICOSA CULTURE AND THE DESERT CULTURE Proceeding from this outline of the complexes, traits, and patterns characteristic of the Picosa continuum in the last two to three millennia before Christ, it is necessary to consider the data in a wider conceptual context. The most basic problem involved in the distinction of the South- west as a discrete culture area in this time period concerns its relation to the concept of the Desert culture as originally generated by Jennings (1953, 1956, 1957) and most recently outlined in Spencer and Jennings' general synthesis (Spencer and Jennings 1965). The preceramic Southwest has, in point of fact, often been taken as one of the most typical examples of the Desert culture. It should be stated at the outset that any attempt to clarify this essential interrelationship is complicated precisely by the confusion arising from the common failure to distinguish the two basic analytic and concep- tual levels of cultural comparison dealt with above. As originally conceived (Jennings 1953,1957), the Desert culture concept operated principally at Level I, expressing succinctly and concretely the important unity of the Archaic cultures of the western United States. Both then and as re-</page><page sequence="5">IRWIN-WILLIAMS] PICOSA 445 cently outlined (Spencer and Jennings 1965), the majority of traits considered diagnostic of the Desert culture pertain to this level: caves as dwellings; exploitation of local resources; caches; seed harvesting; possession of the wooden club, digging stick, atlatl, wood-handled knife, antler wrench, bird-bone whistle, medicine pouch (?); possession of fur-and-feather cloth, of sandals, and of moccasins; possession of mush and gruel, of projectile points, knives, bunts; possession of the simple one-handed grinding stone, grinding slabs, etc. The majority of these traits are certainly as common in the Southwest as in the Great Basin. Significantly, most of those not directly related to environment are also common to the comparable cultures in the eastern United States (Ozark Bluff Dwellers, Harrington 1929). Some are, in fact, common to plant-gathering non-agricultural groups all over the globe. In brief, then, operating at Level I the Desert culture has proved to be one of the most useful and vital concepts generated in recent studies of North American prehistory. The Southwest participates in this concept, and the Picosa ma- terials may be considered as a part of the wide- spread Desert culture or Western Archaic pattern. Unfortunately, the rapidly growing tendency has been to force the Desert culture, a concept rooted in and adapted to the integrative culture- typical structure of Level I, to function simul- taneously and without distinction as a culture- historical entity at Level II. As such, the utility of the Desert culture concept is limited at best. As soon as the focus shifts from the general Archaic pattern to specific historico-genetic traits, difficulty is encountered: For example, three major regional centers of development (California Coast, Great Basin, and Southwest) are recognized in the most recent exposition of the Desert culture (Spencer and Jennings 1965). However, proceeding beyond the notable paral- lels of Level I, it is difficult to discover signifi- cant similarities between them at Level II. Most of Level II traits listed as typical of the Desert culture as a whole, are in fact usually confined to one specific member and reflect its individual culture history. Taking the Great Basin and the Southwest as examples one finds that Desert culture traits such as the scapula grass-cutting tool, L-shaped scapula awl, predominantly twined basketry, etc., are characteristic of the Great Basin, but they are subordinate or absent in the Southwest. Other features typical of the Southwest are rare or absent in the Great Basin. The whole complexion of the chipped stone assemblages of the two areas is distinct; for example, pulpers, choppers and planes are ex- ceedingly common to the Southwest, but they are relatively rare in temporally comparable levels of Danger Cave. Conversely, bifacial knives, common in much of the Great Basin, are rare until late in Picosa development. The projectile point assemblages, supremely sensi- tive in historico-genetic terms, are almost en- tirely distinct. Jennings himself notes the diffi- culty in finding examples of "close identity or (even) resemblance" between artifacts of Dan- ger Cave and Ventana Cave (Jennings 1957: 285). In short, while at Level I the undivided Desert culture is substantiated by the data, at Level II it is not. The import of these difficulties is that while at Level I the unity expressed by the Desert culture concept is a relatively accurate model of the actual pattern of Western Archaic culture, this same unity applied at Level II acts to obscure independent culture-historical devel- opment for its component members. There is accordingly an increasing and perilous tendency to equate participation in the Western Archaic or Desert culture pattern of Level I with actual historic development, contacts, population movements, etc., on Level II. In the same man- ner there is a tendency toward equation of all members of the Desert culture without regard for specific historic origin. In this way, for example, the recent statement is made that the Cochise culture "developed out of the old Nevada-California congeries" (here north and central California and adjacent Nevada, Spencer and Jennings 1965: 41). When actual culture- historical factors are taken into account, the evidence, though scanty, points strongly toward a north-Mexican origin for Cochise. In point of fact, limited evidence suggests that prior to the Elementary period under discussion, the region between Cochise and the "Nevada-California congeries" was occupied first by scattered big- game hunters (Clovis) and subsequently by hunters-and-gatherers who made relatively little use of ground stone (the Red Sand complex of Ventana Cave, and complexes typified by Lake Mohave, Silver Lake, "J," Bajada, and other projectile point styles). The same kind of analysis on two levels at once results in the inclusion of the McKean complex of the north-</page><page sequence="6">446 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 32, No. 4,1967 ern High Plains in the Desert culture (Spencer and Jennings 1965: 41-2). The recognition of "diagnostic Desert artifacts" in Graham Cave in Missouri proceeds a step farther (Spencer and Jennings 1965: 42). In summary, at the first conceptual level, characterized as integrative and culture-typical, the Southwest may be considered a member of the larger Desert culture or Western Archaic pattern. At the second level, characterized as isolative and culture-historical, the Desert cul- ture concept is of limited utility. While the cultural content of the Southwest operates at both levels, its distinctiveness in this period as a discrete cultural entity, termed Picosa, exists principally at the second. The late preceramic Southwest as a discrete culture area simply exists in a conceptual framework different from the Desert culture in its legitimate application. Rela- tions to other Western Archaic culture areas must be considered in the normal historic frame- work of innovation, contact, diffusion, etc. Internal Structure of the Picosa. With this abbreviated structural outline in mind, it is pos- sible to deal with the component units in more detail. It must be recognized that such analysis is tentative in nature, and its validity is that of best approximation on the basis of available data. Modifications in accord with new infor- mation should be expected. In view of the fact that the framework rests in part on considerations of typology, a some- what more detailed examination of this aspect is warranted. The methodology employed is pri- marily a derivation of the type-variety concept as outlined by Gifford (1960), involving the flexible "mode" concept of Rouse (1960). To the study of projectile points, and other classes where applicable, has been added the new device or approach to analysis termed the type system (Irwin-Williams 1963: 119; MacNeish and Irwin 1962). In terms of definition the type system comprises a group of related types (par- ticularly those united by one or a few dominant modes), of which each has a distinct temporal or spatial distribution (preferably sequential or contiguous), and which differ from each other primarily in the character of a single mode attri- bute or a coherent cluster of mode attributes. The definitive (differentiating) shifts in these mode attributes may be correlated with either temporal or spatial variation. The projectile class proved most amenable to the above treatment (Fig. 1), but with more data other classes should receive similar treat- ment. It has been frequently noted that the projectile point class provides some of the more reliable historico-genetic data for nonceramic cultures. Although less sensitive than ceramics, the projectile point class stands in somewhat the same classificatory relation to the nonce- ramic complex as pottery to the relevant later assemblage. Unfortunately, the range and vari- ety of projectile point styles in complexes of the "Archaic" stage are indeed awesome, and there has been some tendency to despair of discerning orderly relationships, substituting instead ran- dom out-of-context morphological (not typo- logical) comparisons. However, in detailed analysis of the relevant material, taken in proper context, projectile points prove to be remark- ably sensitive and accurate culture-historic indicators. On the basis of typology, technology, and inferred ecology three broad spatial divisions may be recognized (Fig. 2): (1) Southern sec- tor, comprising southeastern Arizona, south- western New Mexico, and portions of adjacent northern Mexico (Chihuahua, northern Sonora); (2) Western sector, comprising southeastern California and adjacent southwestern Arizona; (3) Northern sector, comprising northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, southeast- ernmost Utah, southwestern and parts of cen- tral Colorado. This tripartite spatial framework is characterized by the lack of tight discrete or rigid units; rather, there are definite overlaps of trait distribution whose configuration reflects function-determined types closely conforming to regional ecology overlaid by historico-genetic types reflecting broad stylistic relationships. Em- ploying scanty exact and relative chronologic data as well as the above considerations of typol- ogy, technology, and ecology, two major periods of development within each of these may be dimly seen: (1) an early period with a sug- gested duration from about 2500-3000 B.C. to about 800-1000 B.C.; (2) a late period with a suggested duration from 800-1000 B.C. to about 200 B.C.-A.D. 1. As determined from the avail- able data, the characteristic features of these in- ternal spatial-temporal structures are as follows: THE SOUTHERN SECTOR The early period in the Southern sector is represented by the numerous sites in southeast- ern Arizona which Sayles and Antevs included in their definition of the Chiricahua Cochise.</page><page sequence="7">IRWIN-WILLIAMS I PICOSA 447 1000 DSC. _ne_ __ __a 1----l-- I 0 0 0 B ~I SOUTHERN SECTOR NORTHERN AND WESTERN SECTORS FIG. 1. Hypothesized development of projectile point styles in the Picosa culture: 3000 B.C.-Ca. A.D. 1. Comparable materials are found at Wet Leg- gett, the early level (D) of Cienega Creek, and the levels designated Chiricahua at Bat Cave (Sayles and Antevs 1940; Martin, Rinaldo, and Antevs 1949; Haury 1957; Dick 1965). The lowest part of the moist midden at Ventana Cave (Haury 1950), termed "Chiricahua- Amargosa," has recently been considered to be a typical Chiricahua Cochise locality. In terms of typology and technology as well as geographic position, however, it is evidently much more closely affiliated to the "Pinto" materials of the Western sector, with some Chiricahua influ- ence reflected in certain of the less common projectile point styles. Unpublished new mate- rials from southeastern Arizona, surface collec- tions from southwestern New Mexico, and from northern Chihuahua and Sonora attest to the geographic extent of Chiricahua materials. The suggested chronologic position of the Chiricahua Cochise is based on the evidence of radiocarbon analysis and geologic context (Sayles and An- tevs 1941; Martin, Rinaldo, and Antevs 1949; Haury 1950; Dick 1965). Stone-working technology in the Southern sec- tor at this period includes the production of chipped stone artifacts, principally by percus- sion, and of very numerous ground stone imple- ments. The initial belief that all projectile points found with Chiricahua materials were intrusive has been modified by new data. Although poorly known, the numerous projectile points from Chiricahua localities comprise several well-de- fined patterns (Fig. 1). The most diagnostic group belongs to the lateral-notched concave- based system. Its distribution is coincident with the known extent of the Chiricahua Cochise, of which it is evidently an integral part. It overlaps the stemmed indented-base form only in rare marginal situations (for example, Ventana Cave lower moist midden). Evidence from Bat Cave suggests the existence of earlier (shallow notched), and later (deeply notched, deeply concave-based) varieties. A second diamond- shaped (Pelona) system is also diagnostic of the Southern sector, but it is less common and is poorly known. Two subtypes, representing ear- lier (unserrated blade) and later (serrated blade)</page><page sequence="8">448 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 32, No. 4,1967 varieties, were recognized at Bat Cave. Also probably significant is the contracting-stemmed (Augustin) form. However, the spotty distribu- tion in time and space of rather similar con- tracting-stemmed specimens in the Southwest render its significance questionable. Finally, the concave-based Bat Cave form, although very little understood, may well represent a very ancient type which survives into the early period of Picosa development. On the whole, while less studied and understood than the distinctive projectile points of the Northern and Western sectors, those of the Southern sector appear to represent several well-defined diagnostic sys- tems, which should ultimately make it possible to achieve considerable sophistication in analysis. The majority of chipped stone artifacts, other than projectile points, are evidently "core tools." Heavy percussion-flaked choppers and planes are common. Also present, however, are flake side scrapers and cutting edges. End scrapers and unifacial perforators are rare. Bifaces other than projectile points are rare or absent. Large numbers of ground stone implements appear to be characteristic of many Chiricahua Cochise sites, and the processing of plant foods evidently played an important part in the sub- sistence pattern. However, in view of the evi- dence from Bat Cave and elsewhere, it is some- what less certain that the overwhelming pre- ponderance of ground stone over chipped stone in the southeastern Arizona alluvial localities is typical. Handstones are of the one-handed type, with flat, simple convex or "rocker" surfaces. The principal form of grinding slab is a simple shallow-basined form. Mortars and pestles occur rarely. Bone implements include, principally, splinter and metapodial awls and spatulate ob- jects. Perishable materials represented at Bat Cave include, predominantly, coiled basketry, woven sandals, fiber netting, atlatls, fire-making tools, etc. Subsistence techniques evidently placed con- siderable emphasis on wild plant foods. How- ever, as noted above, the alluvial localities of southeastern Arizona may not be typical. The possibility that they represent the functional equivalent of the seasonal gathering camps of northern New Mexico (see below) must not be overlooked. Data from Cienega Creek and Bat Cave evidence the widespread existence of hor, ticulture at this time. Hunting, also, was proba, bly an important, though not dominant, sub, sistence activity. The later period in the Southern sector is represented typically by excavated materials of the San Pedro Cochise sites of southeastern Ari- zona, the San Pedro levels of Bat Cave, and, near the end of the period, by those of Tularosa and Cordova caves, and possibly the late pre- ceramic level of Cienega Creek. The San Pedro levels of Ventana Cave show considerably greater affinity to other San Pedro materials than did the earlier Chiricahua-Amargosa levels to those of typical Chiricahua sites. Stone-working technology includes both per- cussion and pressure flaking, and the use of ground stone. Projectile point styles are rather poorly known, but they seem to combine mem- bers of a new shallow corner-notched system with modified survivals of earlier systems. Chro- nologic variations are dimly visible: Typically San Pedro projectile points are large with shal- low corner notches or low shallow side notches and straight to convex bases. They differ from contemporary Western and Northern styles principally in their relative elongation, use of low side notches and somewhat greater fre- quency of blade serration. Survivals of earlier systems include reduced diamond-shaped forms, possibly related to Pelona, and wide side- notched varieties. In the few sites considered to represent very late preceramic San Pedro (Tularosa Cave), the corner-notched system breaks down into a wide variety of forms, trend, ing in general toward reduction in size, increased length of barb, and, in particular instances, exag- gerated serration or bulbous convex bases. Chipped stone artifacts other than projectile points include core tools, flake tools, and well, made bifaces. Heavy choppers and planes con- tinue in common use. Unifacial artifacts made on flakes include side and end scrapers, cutting edges, serrates and denticulates, discoids and perforators. Bifacial knives are added to the assemblage, but they are never as common as in sites of the Northern sector. Developments in the ground stone implement class include, locally, new trends in handstone form (for example in southeastern Arizona, to- ward increased size), as well as survivals of earlier forms. Grinding slabs likewise show evolution in local forms; for example, in southeastern Arizona the trend is toward a deeper basin. Mortars and pestles are present in limited num- bers. Limited but intriguing data on perishable materials indicate the existence of coiled basket, ry, woven wickerwork sandals, flexible woven</page><page sequence="9">IRWIN-WILLIAMS I PICOSA 449 CALIF~h' L; ' [ A D92 0L 34 .....

In the subsistence pattern, hunting and gath- ering continue as important pursuits. By the end of the period, however, maize, beans, and squash are represented, and agricultural products may well have formed a significant part of the diet. Whether there is a concomitant shift in settle- ment pattern, as recorded in the Northern sec- tor, is not yet known. Limited data suggest the use of circular structures with slightly depressed bases (Sayles and Antevs 1941; Sayles 1945). Although the position of Bed C at Cienega Creek is not completely certain, it is not im- possible that cremation was practiced (Haury 1957). WESTERN SECTOR The early period in the Western sector is rep- resented typically by materials from the Stahl site, the Chiricahua-Amargosa (Lower Moist Midden) of Ventana Cave, surface collections termed "Pinto Basin" by Rogers and others, and Hunt's late Death Valley I and early Death Valley II assemblages (Haury 1950; Campbell and Campbell 1935; Rogers 1939; Hunt 1960; Lanning 1963; Harrington 1957). The stone-working technologies represented by these materials include the use of both ground and chipped stone (by both percussion and pres- sure flaking). The projectile point class is domi- nated by the stemmed indented-base system, which also typifies contemporary materials of the Northern sector. It is considered to be an indigenous Southwestern development from earlier forms (see below), and it should not be confused with other stemmed indented-base groups such as Duncan, Pedernales, Elko, etc., which are the products of other, probably un- related, regional historic development. Employ- ing the type-system concept, certain internal dimensions may be glimpsed (Fig. 1). It may ultimately be possible to distinguish two tem- poral divisions within these early period mate- rials on the basis of temporal developments in projectile point typology. The earliest series is typically recovered from early geologic contexts in association with still earlier forms, but it is rarely in association with types of the late pe- riod. Characteristically, points of this series dis- play a relatively straight stem with shoulders slight to absent, restrained use of serration of the blade, and slightly concave base. Regional varia- tions are already becoming apparent, so that California, northern Arizona-Utah, New Mex- ico, etc., varieties may be easily distinguished. The second series within the early period stemmed indented-base system is frequently recovered from contexts suggesting a date of 2000 to 1000 B.C. and is sometimes found in con- junction with types of the late period. Members of the series are distinguished generally by a trend toward shorter expanding stems, more distinct shoulders, deeper basal concavity, and increased use of blade serration. Other projec- tile points from the early period are poorly known but may represent survivals or members of other systems. Leaf-shaped or ovoid points seem to occur regularly with the above forms. The relation of the contracting-stemmed Gyp- sum Cave type to this material is as yet uncertain. Chipped stone artifacts other than projectile points include both "core tools" and "flake tools." Characteristic are large heavy percussion-flaked choppers and planes. Also present are numerous flake side scrapers and cutting edges, serrates, denticulates, and perforators. Bifacially worked tools (blanks other than points) are relatively uncommon. Ground stone implements include simple one- handed convex-faced manos, and simple shal- low-basined grinding slabs. A local variation from the Stahl site has a deep open-ended basin. Rare mortars and pestles occur. On the whole, ground stone implements, although not occur- ring at all surface localities, seem to be a con- sistent part of the total tool assemblage. Relatively little direct evidence is available on subsistence techniques. Site distribution suggests the existence of specialized mountain hunting camps. Other localities of a somewhat more permanent nature, such as the Stahl site, yield numerous ground stone implements pointing to exploitation of floral resources. There is as yet no evidence as to whether or not simple horti- culture, known from the Southern and North- ern sectors in this period, was practiced in favor- able localities in the Western sector. An isolated instance of burial under a stone cairn (Stahl site) may represent an important pattern. Burial in rockshelters was also evidently widespread (Stahl site; Ventana Cave). The late period in the Western sector is typ- ically represented by the materials from Rose Spring I and II, perhaps part of Ventana Cave San Pedro (Lower Moist Midden), surface col-</page><page sequence="11">IRWIN-WILLIAMS ] PICOSA 451 lections termed "Amargosa," late Death Valley II, the Red Butte surface material, etc. (Lanning 1963; Haury 1950; Rogers 1939; Hunt 1960; Mc- Nutt and Euler 1966). Stone-working technol- ogy includes both grinding and chipping (prin- cipally by pressure). Early in the period the projectile point class is dominated by representa- tives of a newly established corner-notched sys- tem (straight or convex based) and by surviving members of the stemmed indented-base sys- tem. The latter is as yet little studied. Devel- opment within the corner-notched system may make possible chronologic divisions within the late period. Stratigraphic evidence at Rose Spring indicates the existence of an early, larger, relatively shallow-notched series, and a late smaller, deeper notched and barbed series, which may overlap the beginning of the Chris- tian era. Also late are elongated unbarbed straight-stemmed types, and probably other little- known variants. As in the early period, closest stylistic relations are to the Northern sector. However, in certain geographic areas, such as at Ventana Cave, influence of both Western and Southern sectors may be recognized. Among the other chipped stone artifacts, "flake tools" now predominate, although some members of the basic "core tool" assemblage (choppers, planes) are occasionally present. Most numerous are various flake side scrapers, flake end scrapers, perforators, serrates, and denticulates. Characteristic of this late period is the large number of well-made bifacial tools, particularly knives and drills. Grinding slabs and one-handed manos are relatively less common in California. In Ven- tana Cave, possibly related to Cochise influence, they include deep-basined grinding slabs. Mor- tars and pestles occasionally are recovered. Bone implements, though poorly known, include splin- ter and metapoidal awls, gaming pieces, and spatulate objects. Certain geometric engravings on slate charms and pendants in California may date from this period. Available evidence on subsistence suggests continued dependence on hunting-and-gather- ing, and seasonality of movement. Semiperma- nent, or at least repeated, occupation is indi- cated by the existence of thick midden debris (Rose Spring). No evidence is yet available on the possibility that knowledge of horticulture may have penetrated favorable parts of the Western sector. NORTHERN SECTOR The early period in the Northern sector in- cludes materials from four excavated localities: a largely unpublished site near Saguache, Colo- rado (Huscher 1941); an unpublished shelter on the Acoma reservation in northwestern New Mexico (Dittert, personal communication, 1965); the stratified Apex D-E materials from central Colorado (Irwin-Williams and Irwin 1966); and the newly excavated stratified com- plex tentatively termed Armijo 5, from north- western New Mexico (Irwin-Williams 1967a; Irwin-Williams 1967c). A number of surface collections also fall into this period: the San Jose, Concho, Upper Rio Grande, Aneth, Moab, and Gallegos complexes (Bryan and Toulouse 1943; Mohr and Sample 1959; Hunt and Tan- ner 1960; Renaud 1942; Wendorf and Thomas 1951; Agogino and Hester 1956). Stone-working technology includes the use of percussion and pressure flaking and the production of ground stone implements. As in the contemporary Western sector ma- terials, the projectile point class is dominated by the stemmed indented-base system. Two probably chronologic divisions, paralleling in character those in the West, may be recognized. Direct stratigraphic evidence of these systematic developments is available from the Apex D-E complex at Magic Mountain in central Colorado. Among other chipped stone artifacts "flake tools" far outnumber "core tools" in most of the Northern sector. However, in its southern ex- tremities in northwestern New Mexico, heavy planes and choppers are common. Whether this reflects environmental adaptation or the influ- ence of the adjacent Cochise culture is not known. Common unifacial tools made on flakes include side scrapers, thin end scrapers in north- ern Arizona and New Mexico, thick elliptical end scrapers in Utah and Colorado, discoidal scrapers, perforators, cutting edges, serrates, and denticulates. Finished bifacial tools are not common, but they occur more frequently in the northern parts of the sector than in the southern. Ground stone implements include one-handed stones (simple convex) and "rocker" forms, and simple slightly basined slabs. Bone implements, principally metapodial awls, are present. A sin- gle anthromorphic engraving has been recovered. Recent research in northern New Mexico, plus accumulated earlier data, yield consider- able evidence on seasonal subsistence tech- niques. In northern New Mexico specialized</page><page sequence="12">452 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 32, No. 4,1967 summer camps oriented toward exploitation of wild plant resources, as well as summer high mountain hunting camps, are represented. Also present are larger, more permanent sites in pro- tected localities, evidently indicating winter oc- cupation (Irwin-Williams 1967a). In addition there is limited but good evidence of widespread simple horticulture in localities as widely sepa- rated as northern New Mexico and central Colo- rado (Irwin and Irwin 1959; Irwin-Williams 1967a). Although no direct evidence is avail- able on burial practices, data from succeeding periods in central Colorado suggest that inter- ment under a stone cairn may have been a widespread custom. The late period in the Northern sector is rep- resented by excavated materials from Rio Tesu- que; by the stratified materials called Apex C in central Colorado; by the complex tentatively termed Armijo 4 in northern New Mexico and by materials from Hay Hollow (northeastern Arizona); by the collections from Atrisco, Santa Ana, and probably Jemez Cave; and by numer- ous surface collections such as the Lobo, La Sal, and Sangre de Cristo complexes (Wendorf and Miller 1959; Irwin-Williams and Irwin 1966; Irwin-Williams 1967a; Campbell and Ellis 1952; Hunt and Tanner 1960; Martin, personal communication, 1965; Ford, personal communi- cation, 1965). Stone-working technology continues to in- clude both percussion and pressure flaking, as well as the use of ground stone. Projectile point styles comprise, predominantly, survivals of the stemmed indented-base system and representa- tives of the new stemmed corner-notched sys- tem. It is probable that a chronologic division of the late period on the basis of projectile point typology may be recognized. Its outlines are sug- gested by stratigraphic evidence from central Colorado and by absolute chronologic data from northern New Mexico (Irwin-Williams and Irwin 1966; Irwin-Williams 1967a; Agogino 1958). In the earlier portions, within the stem- med indented-base system two independent trends may be observed: (1) a southern varia- tion tending toward great variability, decreased size, and greatly exaggerated blade serration; and (2) a variation particularly characteristic of northern regions, tending toward decreased stem length, deep basal indentation, and ab- sence of blade serration. This latter may reflect the proximity of similar styles in the Great Basin. Early members of the corner-notched sys- tern are characteristically relatively large, short, and broad with shallow corner notches and straight or convex base. Basal grinding is com- mon. Regional variation within this group will become clearer with more information. During the final portion of the late period, survivors of the stemmed indented-base system are rare. The modal trend within the corner-notched system is toward decreased size, lengthened shoulder barbs, deeper notches, and a wide variability which probably comprises several subtypes. These trends parallel to a great extent those in the contemporary Western sector. Direct evi- dence is now available to indicate that devel- opments in early centuries after the beginning of the Christian era (known as Basketmaker II) simply continue and extend the trends already established (see below for more detailed discussion). Chipped stone artifacts other than projectile points comprise principally a wide variety of unifacial flake tools and well-worked bifaces. However, choppers and planes survive in re- duced numbers in some areas, principally in northern New Mexico. Unifacial tools include flake side scrapers and end scrapers, perforators, cutting edges, serrates, and denticulates. Nu- merous very well made bifaces comprise prin- cipally knives, small ovoids which may be either knives or projectile points, and drills. Ground stone implements include several va- rieties of the one-handed mano ("rocker," sub- triangular, etc.), and both deep- and shallow- basined grinding slabs. Relatively rare bone tools include predominantly metapodial awls and spatulate objects. In northern New Mexico there is evidence of shifts in subsistence and demog- raphy. Specialized hunting-and-gathering locali- ties continue to exist, and most protected winter camps continue to be occupied. However, there are indications of a movement into relatively more permanent sites along stream valleys. It is quite possible that this reflects the increasing importance of horticulture as a subsistence tech- nique. A single example documents the prac- tice of burying the dead under stone cairns (Apex C, Colorado). Very late in the period certain regions, prin- cipally those in central Colorado, were evidently abandoned and permanently lost to the South- western culture area. ORIGINS OF THE PICOSA With this background of the character and internal dynamics of the Picosa Elementary</page><page sequence="13">IRWIN-WILLIAMS 1 PICOSA 453 Southwestern culture, it is now possible to con- sider this development in the larger context of time and space. If the data on this late pre- ceramic period are scant, information on earlier periods is practically nonexistent. A few gen- eral suggestions, however, are in order to set the stage for the developments under consideration (Fig. 3). The Southwest has been considered in its role as a descrete culture area from 3000 B.C. onward. Prior to this time, the shifting of the boundaries of previously established culture areas is becom- ing increasingly well documented and may have been closely tied to climatic change (Irwin- Williams 1967b; Irwin-Williams 1967c). At a very early period, most, perhaps all, of the Southwest may have been possessed of a big game-hunting economy (Clovis). Alternatively, particularly in the southern California-north- ern Mexico zone, groups with a somewhat more eclectic economy, of non-Clovis affinities, may have been in existence even as early as the tenth millennium before Christ. The late Pleistocene and early post-Pleistocene witnessed the gradual shrinkage of the western boundary of the typical big game hunting area in response to changing climatic conditions. (This shift is well docu- mented in western New Mexico, where increase ing amounts of territory are lost to the "Plains big game hunting area" to become part of the emerging Southwest.) Probably stemming from a north Mexican origin, Cochise gatherers with an established ground stone industry may have occupied south- eastern Arizona as early as 7300 B.C. In the West, San Dieguito materials have now been radiocarbon dated at about 6900 B.C. (Warren 1967). Although the San Dieguito-Lake Mohave relationship is still obscure, it seems very prob- able that this development ultimately culmi- nated in the Pinto Basin phases of the Western sector. There are indications that the use of ground stone was rare or absent in many of these early western complexes, but whether the groups represented were hunter-gatherers or principally hunters is not yet known. Certainly by about 2500 to 3000 B.C. they possessed a mixed econ- omy and employed ground stone tools. The Northern sector maintained weakening ties to the Plains hunting tradition until relatively late (6000 B.C.); as the boundaries of this culture area contracted and its limits shifted eastward, its place was taken, possibly after a variable hiatus, by new groups, very probably from the west. The poorly known "J" and "Rio Grande" point types and the newly established Bajada com- plex (Irwin-Williams 1967c) show numerous parallels to Lake Mohave materials. Certainly the northern complexes from 3000 B.C. onward exhibit very strong affinities to contemporary Western assemblages. Throughout the Southwest, the need for ex- cavated materials representing this long period before 3000 B.C., evidently encompassing impor- tant climatic and demographic shifts and long cultural development, cannot be too strongly stressed. However, although the impressive lacu- nae in the data leave much room for specula- tion, it seems possible that: (1) the ultimate origins of the groups comprising the emerging Southwestern culture area were multiple (prin- cipally western and southern); (2) through time, adjustment to a relatively similar environs ment, population movement, and low level but widespread contact, produced a synthesis by the first half of the third millennium before Christ, which is here termed the Picosa, and is consid- ered the elementary period of the development of the Southwest as a culture area. RELATION OF THE PICOSA TO FORMATIVE CULTURES OF THE SOUTHWEST (FIG. 3) A detailed discussion of the Formative cul- tures of the Southwest in their relation to the underlying Picosa pattern is largely beyond this discussion. The role of the latter as a base for sedentary development has long been recog- nized. A widely held opinion among South- western archaeologists, based on scanty but per- suasive evidence, is that the addition of pottery, increased sedentarism, and a few other traits transformed the local Cochise into the Mogollon culture. However, while many Cochise ele- ments survive in the Hohokam, some recent research suggests that the distinctive character- istics of that culture may be due to actual large- scale population movement by "invasion" or infiltration. A preceramic Picosa base probably underlies the basic "archaic" Hakataya culture, although northern portions of this area may have received influence from the Anasazi area. Schroeder (1963) suggests that the Anasazi in the Willow Beach-Virgin River area were re- placed by western-based groups after Basket- maker II. Recent research in northern New Mexico (comprising data from an unbroken in situ sequence at the Armijo Shelter, from about 1500-2000 B.C. to A.D. 700) indicates con-</page><page sequence="14">x 0 Mi C z ,- N C - - x IL ova -4 IL 0 cli In orlrlwV C-d -4- olum m3 OAOVWV U 2 w z CD 3i xw M.4 4 2 u 40 2i S3Nno oiiro-- 0 Cld w IEI l +-4 0 z ui z :E m ir 3t 0 I: C6 w 0. w V) I NV$ PQ Co 0 0 Li *jt2 0 a - 1-41u z ul Z 2 W X ID 0 it 4 zw -W 0 w cr w o -4 w uj w cr Lj 0 0 z u &lt; 2 C/)0 0 41 0 ui w cr - cr.0 z z z 39 0 w0 0 m 0 4 2i (1) 0 0 -0 Qj co C) Q C) Q) C) w -j z 0 crZ 0 Q) 2 z z ZC cd 0 Y. cr. w w w PQC 0 w U) a CL 1-4 Ft &gt;0 0 CL 0 w .4 0 W co &gt; 1-4 z 39 3i0 0 Ld -4 N -1 : 4-1 2E- -J4 u w LLj ;-4 w OD 0 w C/) 3Dv-ians I-- -j &gt; w w z x z 4-1;:$ 4-1 *0 0 : z w 0- 6 w C/)n 0- U) U) W) -j &gt; C/) w uj &lt; 1 :3 C/) w w --.) , " z O w U) U) 0 .4 w 1:'4 o 0 0 &lt; U) C) cr 0 0 xw W Lld 0 z F- &gt; D ci LJ 0 z -t biD IU) -"&gt; N- 0 C'd r, oW 0 z 4-1o Cd -4 L) CL cd 0 u0 2 L) b 0x Ir LL- 0-4 ZWC cr --4 M 0 0.- (1) 1-4 Cd 4) cd 0 &lt; F- Cd Ir 0 0 z 4 0 wco C'd w P,-4 C$ 4' w w )k-. 0 &gt; &gt; w Z 0 &lt; O M w LL w IL Z Lj x z :) -C zit , C, 3-4 En zw 'IT o1:1 4: 0 4-1 - 3AV3 IVO 909 u 0 14 biD &gt; 0-4-4 00 w (.)

EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THE PICOSA Lack of data as well as lack of contextual analysis of the available materials makes com- prehension of the external relationships of the Picosa material difficult, and a detailed consid- eration of this problem is not attempted at this time. Relationships here are culture-historical rather than culture-typical in nature. There can be no question, given the rather similar economic level and the function of low pressure diffusion, but that peripheral regions in the Picosa continuum exhibit numerous similarities to adjacent cultures not at present included in that continuum. To some extent the delinea- tion is arbitrary, and further research may cause some reformulation. However, comparisons of this type should be made principally at the cul- ture-historic level and must deal with observed similarities wvithin the total context, not only of whole contemporary assemblages but of long- term developmental patterns. Thus, for ex- ample, the significance of extracontextual lim- ited morphologic similarities between isolated point forms (Elko), particularly late in the se- quence, is seen in proper focus in the realm of stylistic diffusion, rather than as an indicator of basic cultural unity. These styles should be seen as the end point of long developments whose origins and directions are distinct, and whose geometric relations are tangential rather than coincident. In brief then, similarities do exist between Picosa materials and adjacent cul- tures, particularly in eastern New Mexico, west Texas, central California, and the adjacent por- tions of the southern Great Basin. However, at present most of these are considered to reflect a generally comparable Archaic base, coupled with the action of limited specific historic diffu- sion. The long term developmental continuity characteristic of the internal structure of the Picosa materials is absent or considerably attenu- ated outside the Southwest as defined above. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS In summary, the Picosa culture representing the elementary period of Southwestern culture history may be characterized as follows: (1) It is seen as a continuum of similar closely related cultures existing during most of the last three millennia before the Christian era. (2) This is the earliest period in the prehistoric record in which the Southwest can be considered in the role of a discrete culture area. (3) Its parentage, while still obscure, seems to be in a synthesis of developments whose multiple origins reach back to at least the eighth millennium before Christ. (4) Despite the scantiness of the data, the out- lines of its internal spatial-temporal dynamics are becoming increasingly clear: two general temporal divisions, and three spatial sectors (southern, western, northern) have been recog- nized. (5) Several of the well-known ceramic period cultures are seen with some assurance as developments from specific portions of this con- tinuum: Southern sector - Mogollon (and per- haps Hohokam); Western sector - Hakataya; Northern sector - Anasazi. The effect of this is to indicate and emphasize the considerable time depth underlying the often discussed indi- viduality of these regional Southwestern cul- tures. (6) The Picosa continuum shares many elements of economy and orientation with con- temporary cultures in the Great Basin and in a culture-typical sense can be considered a part of the "Desert culture." However, in terms of de- tailed inventory and culture-history, it is a dis- tinct and easily recognizable entity and should not be lumped under the general term. Its rela- tions to this and other contiguous cultures can best be understood in terms of underlying eco- logic adaptation and specific limited historic diffusion. AGOGINO, G.
