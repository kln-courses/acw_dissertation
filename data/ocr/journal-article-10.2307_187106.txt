<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION SCIENCE AS REPRESENTATION: A REPLY TO MR. MacKINNON ROM HARRE Linacre College, Oxford Professor MacKinnon's interesting discussion [13] of some recent theories of mine involves two distinct arguments. In the one he argues against the founding of a general theory of scientific explanation upon the techniques of developing visualizable models as simulacra of the unknown and as yet unexplored generative mechanisms responsible for the patterns of experience, and in the other against the founding of a theory of social psychology upon the idea of the person as agent. The former criticism, though it involves a genuine advance in the theory of science, also involves a rather fundamental misunder- standing of the structure of my argument. It was my intention in my Principles of Scientific Thinking ([6]; also see [10], p. 75) to show that despite the apparent ubiquity of iconic models in the technical apparatus of natural sciences, and despite the evident indispensability of such models for certain theoretical purposes, the fundamental theories of science could not possibly be based upon them. I My first level of response is to highlight MacKinnon's failure to see that the main theses of my Principles [6] involve a distinction almost identical to that which he draws between what he understands by iconic representations and what he calls conceptual representations. It is clear that neither he nor I believe that the analysis of the structure of scientific thought and the explication of the central metascientific concepts like law, explanation etc., can be achieved by analyses confined to the logical form of scientific discourse. MacKinnon and I would agree, as against the positivists, that a scientific explanation, for example, is not identifiable as such from any formal or structural feature it may possess, but rather by some general feature of its content, namely whether or not it describes a real or imagined generative mechanism. If the content condition is not met the discourse is not a scientific explanation. MacKinnon's disagreement with my Philosophy of Science, 44 (1977) pp. 146-158.

MacKINNON 147 point of view derives from his proposal of what he takes to be a more adequate theory than mine by which the content of propositions which "go beyond experience" is to be conceived, namely, what he calls "conceptual representation," a process (and product) that occurs within language. The main thrust of my original argument was to support the claim that in addition to logical and linguistic operations the cognitive side of scientific method must be taken to include techniques for the representation of generative mechanisms which are essential to the enterprise of understanding nature, and worthy of philosophical study. I tried to show that for such techniques to be other than guess work the minimal structure necessary among imagined things and processes involved essentially two analogy relationships, one between the imput- ed behavior of the purported mechanism and the observed behavior of things and materials in the real world, and the other between the nature or constitution of the entities constitutive of the generative mechanism and the natures of things in the real world, so far as we have understood them. These relations between real or imagined things are reflected in the openness of the set of propositions linking together the propositional expression of the different components of the cognitive structure that constitutes a theory. Thus the propositional structure is secondary to and dependent upon the structure of the way a representation of the unknown structure of the real world comes to be formed. Thus, scientific thinking, for me, involves perceived and imagined realities (and the struggle against illusion and fantasy respectively) as well as the orderly and cross-linked structures of sentences describing such things. Clearly on such a view the deductive organization of the propositions of a theory is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for those propositions to constitute a scientific explanation. Sufficient conditions are to be found in the content, and necessary conditions in the strength of the analogies of behaviour, and of constitution or nature. The shift from form-analysis to content-analysis, represented by a shift from a concern with logical form to a concern with the way models can be surrogates for observed generative mechanisms in creating a subject matter for the sentences of theories, is what I called a "Copernican Revolution." The use of the phrase 'Copernican Revolution' was intended pri- marily to mark a shift of attention from what had been central, logical form, to a matter regarded as peripheral to the understanding of the nature of theory, namely general features of content and the way they are arrived at. And I wished as well to hint at a relation to Kant, but more to his doctrine of science in The Metaphysical</page><page sequence="3">ROM HARRE Foundations of Natural Science [12], where he proposes a general dynamical theory of nature, transposing from matter and qualities to individuals with powers. In the Metaphysical Foundations he shows that for scientific purposes we cannot conceive fundamental material entities according to the schemata of perception. Not only did I borrow extensively from this argument in the Principles, [6], but also copied the general layout of Kant's theory of natural science. My first four chapters were concerned with the epistemology and metaphysics of the world as we do and might experience it, scientific methodology for this realm being based upon an indispensable use of iconic models. The last two chapters of the book were concerned with how we cope with the necessity for dealing with reaches of the world we could not experience, and yet of whose causal powers we are very much aware, and about whose nature and relations the regressive structure of scientific progress tempts us to try to speak. Professor MacKinnon's misunderstanding of my argument occurs at just this point in supposing that I am claiming that such imaginative thinking must be in terms of visualizable models. But that is not at all my argument. It takes the opposite course. 1. Epistemological considerations force us to distinguish the realm of actual experience, the realm of possible experience and the realm beyond all possible experience, separated by broad and shifting frontier regions. 2. I do argue that in conceiving of objects in the realm of possible experience we must use iconic models because if the objects of our thought are to be simulacra of entities and processes we might come to experience they must share some properties with the things of the experienced realm. In the realm of possible experience we are still operating with a material-substance- with-qualities metaphysics, albeit somewhat attenuated. 3. But I further argue that iconic models must be abandoned in favour of powers conceptions for the representation of the realm beyond any possible experience because no qualitative properties of visualizable objects can legitimately be attributed to those entities. (In sometimes choosing an icon as a symbol for a power a scientist is not depending in an essential way upon the iconicity of that model, as far as its content goes, but a residual iconicity is retained through structured isomor- phisms.) In Principles ([6], Ch. 10) I argue, following the historically situated arguments of Boscovich and Kant, that even the primary qualities of matter as experienced cannot legitimately be attributed as properties to inexperiencable enti- 148</page><page sequence="4">SCIENCE AS REPRESENTATION: A REPLY TO MR. MacKINNON 149 ties. I cite Faraday, not for his naive icon of lines of force, which is but a pictorial metaphor of the structure and causal powers of the field, but for his profound arguments in the lecture of 1844, in favour of an unpicturable, real but epistemi- cally elusive world of powers, as the foundation for the world as we experience it. 4. This, I argue, following Faraday, does not mean that we cannot conceive the world beyond experience, but that it must be imagined in terms which can transcend the epistemological barrier. So far as I can see there are only two such determina- bles-powers and structures. We are thus enabled to conceive or imagine generative mechanisms as structures of powers. In this way a general realism can be preserved by developing an ontology of individuals as powers, as attempted for example by Madden and Hare [14] and Bhaskar [2]. It is to such entities that theories developed for a level at which there could be no possible visual or other sensory experience, refer. Had I had in hand MacKinnon's useful distinction between concep- tual representing and iconic (as visualizable) representing I could have stated my point much more clearly. A structure of powers cannot be visualized, but it can be conceived (as Priestley [16] argued against Hume) and as such can be the subject matter of a discourse, a set of asserted sentences constituting the linguistic part of the theory, but as an imagined real world it is extralinguistic, and that is the nub of our dispute. The only species of objects of which we are currently aware that are structures of powers are fields. There may come to be many other kinds of species of that genus. If we propose to say anything at all about the nature and structure of the world beyond all possible experience there really is no alternative but to speak of it as and conceive it to be a system of pow- ers to produce changes within the world as we experience it. With that misunderstanding cleared up it seems that so far MacKin- non and I are at one. Ironically his misunderstanding of my argument derives from his wielding a much clearer conceptual tool for making the distinction I want between imagined entities and processes realiza- ble in possible experience and those which are not so realizable. But there is a genuine and important difference between us nevertheless whose exploration will prove instructive. Is conceptual representing within language or independent of lan- guage, though contingently it may from time to time spring from language? Is imaginative intuition dependent upon or at least indepen-</page><page sequence="5">ROM HARRE dent of what MacKinnon calls the "interiorization of language?" I claim the latter, while it seems clear that MacKinnon is claiming the former. How might one adjudicate between us? It might look at first sight as if we are caught between the ancient and sterile controversy around the alleged independence of thought and language, and the empirical question of whether in actual human thinking the outstripping of language by the creative imagination is or is not a genuine if occasional phenomenon. But there is a way in which we can resort to fruitful argument, by considering the basis of the principle that what should properly be said about the world consists of a narrower set of propositions than those admitted by logic, grammar and semantic principles. From whence derives this constraint? I suppose both parties to the dispute are at least so much empiricists as to agree that extralinguistic experience constrains our discourse about the world revealed in experience, either directly by settling the question of truth and falsity for some forms of statement, or indirectly through semantic rules, forming a kind of diachronic sediment of experience. It is my contention that the products of the disciplined imagination constrain discourse about the world beyond all possible experience in the same way as experience constrains discourse about the world revealed or capable of being revealed by experience, since for linguistic representation of that world, forever beyond experience, to have a subject matter, a surrogate for experience of that world must be created by imaginative thought. I would be the last to dispute that the ontological principles of such imaginings appear as reflections in the semantic rules of language. It is this fact I believe that has misled MacKinnon, tempting him to think that his valuable distinction between iconic (read by him as experiencable) and conceptual representation is identical to that between imagination-based and language-based representation. For example that no two things can be in the same place at the same time was a principle of the ontology of classical physics, determining how we were to conceive the world, and no doubt this ontological principle is reflected in the semantic rules governing the syntagmatic and paradigmatic dimensions of the word 'thing' and its various near synonyms. The world of leptons and baryons cannot be thought of along these lines, and no doubt the grammar of the use of these expressions and the semantic rules allowing their proper combinations reflects this. For me the contrast between visualizable and conceptual representa- tion is matched by the contrast between simulation of reality in an image, taken concretely, and its representation in an image taken abstractly. But for that image to represent a world, abstraction must 150</page><page sequence="6">SCIENCE AS REPRESENTATION: A REPLY TO MR. MacKINNON 151 fall short of the elimination of structure and of causal powers. Symbols cannot simulate but of course they can and do represent, and I am more than willing to concede the possibility of a representation of the unknowable derived by an initial concatenation of symbols which come to acquire meaning and thus guide the imagination in conceiving of a surrogate for experience of that world. Having stated my case, drawing in some measure upon MacKinnon's "reinterpretation," I turn to examine his positive arguments for his position. His position is revealed in three key sentences, and I will comment upon each in turn. 1. "Rules of semantic compatability, few of which are explicit, govern the attribution of properties, powers and activities to different types of things and processes" ([13], p. 74). As a matter of fact observation about the synchronic state of representational systems, this is no doubt correct and an important strike against logicists, but on pain of idealism one must insist that these rules are the diachronic sedimentation of experience and the product of its analogical and metaphorical extension in the imagination, though I do not wish to deny that extension of meaning can and sometimes does occur by processes internal to language, of which simile and metaphor may be two. 2. "An iconic representation is an isolated unit" ([13], p. 74), but, so I think the argument runs, it must draw upon more general matters, e.g. knowledge of types of things etc., and these, so MacKin- non contends, must (do?) derive from something intrinsically linguistic, namely sortal terms. My particular development of the theory of iconic models depended heavily on the necessity for a source for hypotheses about the behaviour of the imagined entities etc., a source found in the content of a more general theory. Bunge [3] developing a position almost identical to mine makes the same point. But, though Bunge and I would insist on the iconicity of the basic conception, that is that we imagine a type of thing, or process or structure etc., we would both insist too that our task is to formulate theories about such things based upon their similarities and differences to other things, and to draw inferences about them. But the subject matter about which the logico-linguistic work is done is not internal to the language. While I would concede, contrary to my insistence in Principles ([6], Ch. 1) that real or imagined things need not be prior to discourse about them, that it is contingent which has temporal priority, I can see nothing in MacKinnon's argument as so far quoted which would lead me to abandon their absolute distinctness. 3. Conceptual representations are functional and not iconic, that is, "they function, not by picturing objects, but by supplying material</page><page sequence="7">ROM HARRE rules of inference" ([13], p. 74). This, MacKinnon's third and last argument bites deeper, because so far as I can see it represents the beginnings of a descent into idealism, the ever-present danger for those who follow the knife edge of the unmodified Kantian theory of the categories and schematisms. For consider MacKinnon's words glossing his distinction between functional and iconic: "they [concep- tual representations] function, not by picturing objects, but by supply- ing material rules of inference." Eliminating the misleading "picturing of objects," which I hope I have shown to be a misreading of my conception of the iconicity of conceptions, this remark is either a restatement of my own theory, that abstract representings supply such linguistic items as material rules of inference for marshalling discourse about the realm of the world they represent, since faute de mieux we must marshall our discourse by reference to the properties of the inexperiencable realm; or it represents a closure of circular progress within language, in the course of which the distinction between the discourse and what it describes cannot be generated; and this is idealism. II In discussing the issue of "what things are," MacKinnon points to the possibility of a transcendental deduction as the only way of coping with the problem of selection among possible accounts of the world beyond all possible experience. He comments that "it is certainly not part of science or the usual philosophy of science." Whether this is so or not (and I think it is not) I am convinced that it should be. In his commentary upon-this part of my argument MacKinnon has simply got it wrong, the fault no doubt lying in my exposition. Contrary to MacKinnon's assertion, "Harre's apriori, dictating what ultimate reality must be" does not follow "from his reliance on visualizable models." On the contrary it follows from the argument at the beginning of Principles ([6], Ch. 10) that no non-structural attributes of the world of experience can be projected into the ultimate structure of the world, as we can conceive it ("for us" as I repeatedly say in Principles), and hence the technique of simulating reality by iconic modelling followed by an extension of the world of experience to provide a test, is wholly useless. The best I can do to rebut MacKinnon's accusation of aprioristic hubris is to briefly recapitulate the argument in simpler and I hope clearer terms. My attempt at a transcendental deduction proceeded through two stages, the first aimed at elucidating the properties of the framework 152</page><page sequence="8">SCIENCE AS REPRESENTATION: A REPLY TO MR. MacKINNON 153 of causally inert relations for that world, the framework that is manifested as space and time in the world of our experience. I tried to show, in a very loosely argued vein, that certain spatio-temporal frameworks were incompatible with the possibility of motion in the world of our experience. Properly tightened up those negative argu- ments stand. The positive argument, aimed at selecting one and only one of the remaining possibilities was fallacious. (See [11].) As I now see it the transcendental deduction leaves us still with alternative, intelligible world frameworks, but their intelligibility owes nothing whatever to their visualizability. The mathematical continuum is not visualizable. The second stage of the argument was directed at the realization of the project of specifying, in a very general way, the causally potent agents or individuals of the world beyond all possible experience. MacKinnon's linking of the arguments at this stage with those concern- ing the framework corresponding to space and time is a mistake. He attributes to me the following argument: "If some sort of spatial and temporal continuity must be attributed to whatever physical reality is ultimate then the only candidate that seems to meet this requirement is some sort of extended field." My actual argument is quite different, and is wholly independent of any premise deriving from the tran- scendental properties of the causally inert ("Spatio-temporal") frame- work. It runs like this: I. Imaginative intuition as to the nature of the individuals of the world beyond all possible experience cannot be based upon the use of visualizable models as simulacra of the individuals of the ultimate structure of the world (for us). 2. The only attributions we can make to such individuals is that of causal potencies or powers, since these individuals manifest themselves not as they are, but in the behaviour and structure of the things and materials of the world as we experience it. 3. Power (or grounded active disposition) is an empirical concept though not given in a single experience, that is there are rules for deciding for or against the attribution of a power to an individual on empirical grounds. Furthermore, by moving towards cosmical powers, that is powers whose dispositional component is relative either to every species of material individual (like gravity) or to the universe at large (like inertia), we can eliminate from our fundamental theory the notorious relativity of dispositions. 4. The potentials of field physics are the only concepts available</page><page sequence="9">ROM HARRE so far in natural science that have the general properties of powers. Hence the ultimate, for us, must be conceived along the lines of our conception of the field. Patently this derivation depends in no way at all upon whether the individuals of the world we are trying to represent are discrete entities or form a continuous plenum. In fact I opted in Principles ([6], Ch. 11) for a system of discrete entities (not a universal field) each with its own system of powers. But this option was not based upon any argument. As Madden and Sachs [15] have shown, the choice between a universal field and a multiplicity of "force-atoms," though each meets the transcendental conditions, cannot be arbitrary since it has consequences for the form of the laws of nature, a point I had not taken in the Principles. The transcendental deduction may have been bold, and indeed had some serious defects of exposition in its original form in Principles ([6], Chs. 10 and 11), but Professor MacKinnon has not even dented the argument since he has not addressed it. Finally, as MacKinnon says, I am as much concerned with linguistic products as anyone else, that is with science as discourse and with the rules and principles upon which the rationality of that discourse depends. Indeed a major aim of Principles was to try to bring out those extra-logical principles upon which the rationality of scientific thinking depends. But this does not support MacKinnon's thesis as to the priority of language over imaginative intuition, nor does it tend to show that iconicity or any other general property is or is not a necessary feature of scientific creative imagination. III The most detailed applications of the icons and powers theory so far attempted have been Secord's and my Explanation of Social Behaviour [7] and Shotter's [18] development of the theory as a foundation for a psychology of infancy and early childhood. Professor MacKinnon discusses only Secord's and my efforts so I shall confine myself to their defence. Our critique is based upon considerations which are not fully in focus in MacKinnon's brief critique of our theory. His argument against us turns on three issues. (i) After my laying so much emphasis on taking the practice of scientists seriously, how can we reject an existing form of scientific practice as unsound in principle? 154</page><page sequence="10">SCIENCE AS REPRESENTATION: A REPLY TO MR. MacKINNON 155 (ii) The alternative foundation we propose, namely the common- sense notion of a human agent, is objectionable. MacKinnon seems to have two objections in mind: a. our talk of the day-to-day theorizing on social matters by man and woman as involving "the anthropomorphic model" introduces a sense of 'model' not among those of the taxonomy of models proposed in Principles ([6], Ch. 2). b. psychology ought not to be restricted a priori to any given general conception of human nature. (iii) Asking people to explain their actions and taking these explanations seriously as a contribution to social science, the technique called "accounting," is an undefended return to introspectionism. I shall concern myself with only two of the many issues raised by MacKinnon's critique. 1. The Issue of our Rejection of Naive Experimental Social Psychol- ogy. We argue that experimental social psychology, as practised in the positivist, behaviourist tradition, is not a genuine science, develop- ing out of real problems of understanding a given and growing subject matter, but an artificial construction based upon an unsound philo- sophical theory of science, that is it is not an attempt to study human social behaviour as such, but an effort to fulfil an a priori methodology. And the assumptions behind this methodology are demonstrably at variance with the character of the problems to be investigated and the nature of the individuals and structures involved. The given phenomena requiring to be understood, are plan-forming and rule-following by active, self-monitoring agents, the understanding of meaning, the performance of actions meaningful to others, and the mutual production of patterned, integrated action-sequences in the performing of which social acts are achieved, such as ceremonies, both formal and informal. We argue that these are the very phenomena to which the idea of the person is related. If it were not absurdly pretentious we would like to think of our setting out of the concept of a person as developed out of philosophical analysis of folk understandings of social life, as having the same conceptual status as Darwin's elaboration of the concept of Selection, as a general Idea, in Whewell's sense. It enables us to formulate specific theories for the solution of specific problems of understanding, but is not itself a theory. Rather it presents a schema for all explanatory theories within that realm of things and processes.</page><page sequence="11">ROM HARRE Thus taking human beings to be people, involves as we have shown, that all specific theories for understanding specific social action-pat- terns, should involve meanings and second-order self-monitoring, just as all specific theories or organic change should involve selection-pres- sure. But in one respect the concept of a person is unlike the Darwinian Idea of Selection. In mid-nineteenth century when the Idea was first broached one could envisage its total failure as every specific theory formulated in its terms for specific phenomena failed empirical test. But the concept of a person, despite great diversity of forms, has we believe, very wide generality, and is the survivor of aeons of successful explanations of social phenomena based upon it. But it does not follow from this that enormous advances cannot be made in the light both of a wider cross-cultural and historical knowledge of the variety of human social forms, and in greater precision of thought. We would offer the Person as the Whewellian Idea upon which great advances might be made both in the study of the way individuals represent and process social knowledge, and in the structure of society, both small and great. But just as anxiety does not cease to be the phenomenon to be explained when adrenalin has been isolated as one of its physical bases, so even the detailed mapping of the flow of intended and unintended consequences could not turn human beings into automata. Social reality is constituted by the mutual actions of people, and so the concept of a person is no more dispensable in favour of some other schematic outline of the nature of human beings than is meaning in favour of sound patterns in the study of language. 2. The Issue of "Accounting." A central feature of ethogenic methodology is the admission of those formerly called "subjects" to the status of participants in the investigation. That involves taking their explanatory speech seriously both as a contribution to the theoretical explanation of the patterns of meaningful interaction under investigation, and as resource for the study of the cognitive functioning of those competent in social action. The idea of "accounting" comes from two sources: from ethnomethodology, where it represents a technique for the achievement of sociability [17]; and from the work of George Kelly and others [ 1 ] where it is the route to an understanding of the cognitive foundations of social competence, that is to an understanding both of the content and organization of the tacit social knowledge required for adequate performance, and of the planning and rehearsal techniques upon which individual success depends. The most elaborated form of account analysis is to be found in the criminological record analysis of De Waele [4]. Accounting theory is not, and was never intended to be, a revival 156</page><page sequence="12">SCIENCE AS REPRESENTATION: A REPLY TO MR. MacKINNON 157 of introspection. The point can be made clear by introducing a distinction prominent in more recent ethogenic studies but only tacit in Harre and Secord, namely that between the efficient causes of actions and speeches and their formal causes ([8], [9]). Accounting theory is not directed at the development of a methodology for discovering efficient causes, but for the investigation of formal causes, that is the preformed structures which are manifested as structured public performances, not at the occasional stimuli which bring these performances forth on any particular occasion. In this shift of emphasis ethogenic social psychology is a method out of the same stable as generative linguistics. The fundamental idea is that in the speech accounting for and glossing social action there will be revealed a structure that is isomorphic with the structure revealed by a microso- ciological analysis of the social interaction concerned, considered with respect to its semantic structure, as a system of actions and acts, each mode of analysis serving as an empirical check upon the other, and the two together grounding attributions of that structure to competent performers in that fragment of social life. The problem of the means by which that structure is realized in individual human beings is a matter for developmental psychology and psycholinguistics. The aim of ethogenic social psychology is to generate the right range of questions for the individual psychologist to answer. REFERENCES [I] Bannister, D. and Mair, J. M. M.
