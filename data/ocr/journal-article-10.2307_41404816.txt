<plain_text><page sequence="1">Roger H. Ford Susquehanna Township High School Harrisburg , Pennsylvania Let the Wild Rumpus Start! With that command, Max leads a herd of horned, clawed, yellow-eyed Wild Things in an orgy of hopping, howling, and swinging. They are childish trouble-makers, and he is their king. In other books written and illustrated by Maurice Sendak, similar children ap- pear. They deal with their worlds in ways that often seem humorous and il- logical. The boys among them tend to be fighters. Others, a girl named Rosie and a terrier named Jennie, are less pug- nacious. Yet all share a common trait: they are Tricksters. As they cavort, one can see that the archetype of the Trick- ster has a basic, formative influence in Sendak's work. The Trickster is an archetype that is well represented in modern and in primitive cultures. One meets the Trick- ster in slapstick comedian Charlie Chap- lin, in foolish yet cunning Br'er Rabbit, in Melville's ambiguous confidence man. He has been part of American thought and humor since the early 1800s when Americans created both Jonathan, who thumbed his bumpkin's nose at their haughty British neighbors, and the Yan- kee trader, who could charm money from the closest-held pocketbook. That era survives today in yet another varia- tion of the Trickster. He is tall-talking Davy Crockett, half alligator and half mountain lion, who, children know, "killed him a bar when he was only three" (Rourke 1931). In ancient cultures he appeared among the Greek gods as Hermes, the messenger, and among Norse gods as Loke, the expert at dis- guise and disruption. He is Prometheus and the Devil. American Indians knew him as Coyote, Raven, Hare or Wakjun- kaga (Trickster). Wherever the Trickster appears, he encompasses seemingly antithetical characteristics. Childlike, no matter what physical shape he happens to as- sume, Trickster is dominated by his self- ish appetites and emotions. He can be a fool, a lecher, a cheat, or a practical joker. His processes of ingestion and excretion are sometimes emphasized. 386 Language Arts • Vol. 56, No. 4 • April 1979</page><page sequence="2">He can assume a variety of shapes at will. Because of that trait, he is neither completely human nor completely ani- mal. This lack of definition suggests his social impact, for he can create total chaos. Yet, when he happens to trick some force ill-disposed to humans, Trickster can aid society. He can be- come a hero or a savior, a bringer of light and knowledge like Prometheus. In some mythologies, Trickster is even a creator. For example, in a tale told by North American Indians but having world-wide variants, Trickster forces or convinces another animal to dive to the ocean's bottom and to dredge up soil for the formation of earth's land masses. Trickster's part in the action is not that of a god; his is the work of a medicine man or shaman, a fearful or at least un- trustworthy magician who seems to con- trol powerful earth-spirits (Campbell 1959; Henderson 1964; McGuire et al. 1969). Trickster, then, is characterized by spontaneity, unpredictability, and the direction of his not inconsiderable pow- ers toward wish fulfillment. He has been called a "neither-both" character in lit- erature (Wadlington 1975), a designation that is in the spirit of a traditional Arme- nian opening for folk tales: "Once there was and was not" (Sutherland 1976, p. 283). Boundaries separating possible from impossible, reality from fantasy, are destroyed. Social bonds may shift as well. All in all, the Trickster's actions can be exciting and creative. Such qual- ities inform Maurice Sendak's rambunc- tious stories for children. Books to be discussed include The Sign on Rosie's Door , the four little vol- umes of the Nutshell Library , Where the Wild Things Are , Hector Protector and As I Went Over the Water, Higglety Pig- glety Pop ! or There Must Be More to Life, and In the Night Kitchen. They will be discussed in order of publication. The Sign on Rosie's Door (1960) tells the story of an imaginative little girl's at- tempt to gain recognition from and dom- inance over her friends. She wins her way as a Trickster, changing her iden- tity and becoming increasingly mysteri- ous. In that process the signs she places on her door play an important part. The first sign reads, 4 'If you want to know a secret, knock three times" (p. 6). Re- sponding with that mystical number of raps, Kathy, a friend, discovers Rosie's secret: "I'm Alinda, the lovely lady singer" (p. 6). In the accompanying illus- tration, Rosie holds herself serenely while Kathy stares, bewildered. A sec- ond sign of Rosie's says, "If you are looking for me it won't be easy because I am wearing a disguise. Yours truly, Alinda" (p. 26). The change of name has remained, and Sendak's illustration shows Alinda seated on her cellar door and totally covered by a red blanket. Her friends appear amazed and in- tensely interested. Yet Rosie's simply changing her name does not captivate her friends. She must involve them in some magical event. Ini- tially she tries staging a show in which she appears costumed, preens, and at- tempts to sing "On the Sunny Side of the Street." Sendak's illustration of hooting children reveals how poorly Alinda fares (pp. 12-3). Moreover, Lenny, a Trickster in his own right, appears, offers to show a trick with his fireman's hat, and dis- rupts Alinda's show. Deprived even of Lenny's fireman's hat, which she thought she had won, Rosie climbs atop a folding chair, introduces herself to va- cancy as Alinda, and sings her song completely. Her first attempt has been a failure because she did not fully involve her friends and because Lenny outdid her as a Trickster. Rosie's second magical event suc- Let the Wild Rumpus Start! 387</page><page sequence="3">ceeds, however, because she shifts her role slightly from being simply the main character to being stage manager. When her friends discover her draped in red, she tells them that she is waiting for the Magic Man. Since they are bored, the other children wait with her, and al- though he does not appear, they find the day satisfying. They return on the next day, the Fourth of July; Rosie puts on her red blanket, and, rather witch-like, sits holding her cat. Even Lenny, who enters as a cowboy, cannot disturb the children's waiting, perhaps because as soon as he has become quiet, Rosie an- nounces the arrival of the Magic Man. She is like a shaman or a witch because only she can communicate with him. That she has fulfilled her friends' wishes is indicated by their supplying the details of the Magic Man's appearance and by Sendak's illustration in which they are biting their nails, throwing up their arms, and swooning (pp. 38-9). Rosie's function as shaman continues as she leads and participates in a small riot that has the trappings of ancient ritual. She is "a big red fire cracker" (p. 39) and the others, by virtue of the Magip Man, are "little silver firecrack- ers" (p. 40). Four pages of exploding, dancing, and romping follow. The fun is chaotic but harmless, much in the man- ner of the festum asinorum , a medieval church celebration of Mary's flight into Egypt. In that ritual, the congregation brayed, even to the point of braying three times instead of saying Deo gratias (McGuire et al. 1969). In Sendak's book, however, the firecrackers are probably including in their actions an exorcism of their wrath at being denied fireworks with which properly to celebrate the Fourth. Rosie's great trick is the deception of her friends, especially Lenny. Her ac- tion is not unlike that of Loke, who ar- ranges Thor' s masquerade in the Norse myth of "How Thor Found His Ham- mer" (Sutherland 1976, pp. 447-49). She is a confidence artist who "not only re- quires the consent of [her] victims, but, like a creator, demands belief" (Wad- lington 1975, p. 21). Rosie's friends, however, are quite willing to be tricked and are not hurt. Rosie succeeds be- cause of her role-playing, in which one sees a mixture of self-awareness and credulity. After The Sign on Rosie's Door with its plot based on the Trickster's antics and powers, Sendak published the Nutshell Library (1962). It contains four books: Chicken Soup with Rice , Alligators All Around , One Was Johnny , and Pierre. Of the four, Chicken Soup with Rice: A Book of Months is least influenced by the Trickster. The protagonist does think of becoming a robin, a smiling cooking pot, and a whale that spouts hot soup. He imagines riding a crocodile down the Nile, a feat sufficient for a tall tale, tells of pepping up some roses with chicken soup, and looks forward to being host to witches and goblins, true Tricksters all, in October. The book, however, has no explicitly drawn or stated recipient of trickery. It is simply a pleasant celebra- tion of a food children enjoy. Alligators All Around : An Alphabet presents a family of reptiles who, much like other animals in children's stories, stand erect, walk on two feet, wear clothing, and express human emotions. They are sometimes Tricksters. For example, one sees them as they burst balloons, imitate Indians, look like lions, and push people. The child of the fam- ily, according to one picture and caption, enjoys x-ing x's with paint on the wall of a room. Theirs is the exuberance of causing trouble; they evoke a physical, slapstick humor. Unlike the alligators, Johnny, of One 500 Language Arts</page><page sequence="4">Was Johnny: A Counting Book, desires order. Almost consequently, he is plagued by Tricksters, animals and a robber who invade his privacy and dis- rupt his peace. Incidentally, they include two archetypal Tricksters, the blackbird and the monkey (see Henderson 1964, p. 112). More to the point, Johnny expels them by tricking them. He makes the outrageous threat of eating his uninvited guests, a threat recalling the Trickster's appetitive nature, and he begins to count backwards. That reversal is clever, for it suggests a traditional method of conjuring, the oral reversal of a meaningful statement. With each number, a Trickster leaves, suggesting Johnny's power as a shaman; and the only one playing an added trick is the monkey, who steals a banana. Unlike Johnny, Pierre of Pierre : A Cautionary Tale loses power over him- self and his surroundings because he acts as a Trickster. His tricks are not physically aggressive, although Pierre does pour syrup on his head at break- fast, so much as they are vocally and psychologically destructive. Pierre re- fuses to pay attention to his parents and responds to every statement or question with "I don't care." As Saul Braun ob- serves, Pierre "is very much the typical Sendak lad: combative, pugnacious, dif- ficult, dedicated to the seemingly hope- less task of defending himself from small and large assaults - in other words, a stubborn brat" (1970, p. 37). Yet his characteristics go farther. Pierre is, in toying with a lion that amus- ingly asks to eat him, astoundingly un- conscious of reality as most people know it. In that respect, he is like the Trickster who, as Jung writes, "is so unconscious of himself that his body is not a unity, and his two hands fight each other." Herein lies the Trickster's ridiculousness but also his secret of metamorphosis (McGuire et al. 1969, p. 263). Pierre, eaten by the lion yet later regurgitated entirely unhurt, shares that trait of changeability. The ill lion's responding, "I don't care" to Pierre's anxious par- ents when they come home and cannot find the boy underlines the suggestion of trickery. Pierre makes a ridiculous error, not unlike that made by the Trickster in an Indian tale. The curious Trickster thrust his head inside the skull of an elk and became trapped (McGuire et al. 1969, p. 264). As in that tale, the animal in which the Trickster is imprisoned says some- thing about that particular Trickster's character. It is not surprising that pug- nacious Pierre should be trapped inside a lion. Where Johnny and Pierre end their trickery, Max of Where the Wild Things Are (1963) begins. Max is an ac- complished Trickster. From the first, he appears in a wolf costume that leaves only his face uncovered. He has claws, pointed ears, and a luxuriously bushy tail. These details recall the Trickster's ambiguous mixture of animal and human qualities. Significantly, they also reappear decorating the Wild Things, who stand upright and have some crudely human features. This ambiguity continues in the chaos and mutations Max produces by two of his tricks. First one reads that Max is making "mischief of one kind and another," and one sees Max as he drives a nail into the wall and chases his Sealyham terrier with a fork. Naturally enough, when his mother calls him, "Wild Thing," he threatens to eat her. Sendak's understated captions and viv- idly expressive illustrations leave no doubt that Max can thoughtlessly create chaos and put himself in a bind. Like the archetypal Trickster, Max re- sorts to more tricks in order to free him- Let the Wild Rumpus Start! 389</page><page sequence="5">self. "That very night in Max's room a forest grew"; in three successive illustra- tions one sees the room totally trans- formed. Most important during this crea- tive act of Max's imagination, Sendak does not blatantly suggest that Max is dreaming. Rather, he shows that Max first paces thoughtfully, next laughs mis- chievously, and finally dances with his arms raised and his face turned away from the reader and toward the moon and a land filled with strange vegetation. This land is the creation of Max the Trickster. Max's third trick aligns him with the shamanistic Trickster. Like the wily shaman, Max uses magic to dominate the Wild Things to whose land he jour- neys. One reads that "Max said 'BE STILL!' and tamed them with the magic trick of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all and made him king of all wild things." The Wild Things' fear of Max underlines his shamanistic control of them. His unpredictable power is to be treated circumspectly. Max's trick of creating the land of the Wild Things does allow him to escape being trapped in his room. With them he can be unconcernedly spontaneous, whether in leading the splendidly wild rumpus or in sending the Wild Things to bed without supper. The place is liter- ally a Trickster's paradise full of rotund devils and anthropomorphic beasts. They respond to their emotions; their logic runs only as deep as the plea, "Oh please don't go - we'll eat you up - we love you so!" Max simply knows stronger magic than they. He is more creative. Hector of Hector Protector (1965) fol- lows Max in Sendak's line of rollicking Tricksters who fall into trouble because of their lack of self-consciousness. Hec- tor disrupts life at home as his mother struggles through three pages to fulfill the opening ironic caption, "Hector Pro- tector was dressed all in green." Just as willfully, he disturbs the peace of the queen, who is a symbol of order and decorum - especially since she resem- bles Queen Victoria. Of course the king and the royal Sealyham are not spared his acquaintance, and one finally sees that Hector rides gleefully from the palace. His demeanor changes when he arrives home and is confronted by his mother who angrily points at the dis- carded cake that Hector was supposed to take to the queen. Sendak shows a surprised, worried look on Hector's face; the boy utters simply, "Oh!" and seems ready to surrender his toy sword. Like the archetypal Trickster, Hector has behaved viscerally, has enjoyed his tricks, but has himself fallen victim to them. Unlike the archetype, Hector cannot escape through more trickery. His final tantrum solves nothing, and, as we later see him ask his pet blackbird for a piece of the cake, he apparently receives no supper. Hector does not visit the queen unac- companied. On his way to the queen, he meets and subdues a ferocious lion and a large snake. These acts, although typi- cal of heroes who are not Tricksters, fit Hector's character as Trickster, for the Trickster is capable of heroism. Moreover, those two animals carry out Hector's disruption of the royal house- hold. Sendak's illustrations show that Hector directs the beasts and enjoys their antics. Combined, the three characters make a fine emblem for the Trickster: the cunning snake, the loud but not necessarily dangerous lion, and the happy brat. Significantly, when Hec- tor's trick ends he leaves the animals who, like the Wild Things deserted by Max, are sad to see him go. 390 Language Arts</page><page sequence="6">The story has one more Trickster, the pet blackbird whose fate parallels Hec- tor's. When Hector is resisting being dressed in green, the blackbird seems initially to be on his side. The bird's "No!" echoes Hector's. As mother quietly dresses the child, however, the blackbird becomes her ally. Ultimately it perches on the queen's cake and, as mother smiles trustingly, responds to Hector's final "No!" with "Go!" From a window it watches him kick the cake. When Hector returns, the bird laughs at his predicament and leads the procession to Hector's room, crowing, "Ho!" and laughing. That evening it dons the crown that had been on the cake and eats the entire thing, refusing to give Hector a bite. Finally we see a rotund blackbird that groans, "Oh!" while it weakly holds the fancy pink napkin on which the cake had been placed. The blackbird, like the ar- chetypal Trickster Raven, has given in to its appetite. Although it has appar- ently bested Hector, the blackbird is re- ally a king of fools. As I Went Over the Water is less com- plicated than Hector Protector , for it merely identifies its protagonist as a Trickster. Victor initially seems to be just a pugnacious boy whose peace, like Johnny's of One Was Johnny , is shat- tered by tricks, by a monster's eating his boat and two blackbirds' calling him names. On the other hand, Victor's laughing after punching the monster and his showing no lasting concern for his boat reveal that Victor, like the Trick- ster, lives only in the present moment. Victor's identity becomes clear at the story's end when Victor, again captain of his boat, places sailors' hats on the three animals, and all voyage together. They contrast to Jennie of Higglety Pigglety Pop ! (1967), who has no friends. Jennie is a very little Trickster. Her characteristic trick, both in the book's narrative section and in its final illus- trated play, is omniverousness. She greedily eats leaves, food of all sorts, and a mop. Moreover, like the Trickster, she can be callous (see Bell 1968). That trait appears especially in her eating all of the potted plant's leaves, thus killing it (p. 5), in her lying to the cat (p. 13) and to Rhoda (p. 17) in order to eat a glut- tonous amount of food, and in her wish- ing the cat, whose milk she has entirely consumed, good luck with his future de- liveries (p. 15). Jennie lacks friends be- cause of her greed, which is not immoral but amoral. The Trickster in Jennie appears most vividly in her futile attempt to feed Baby. Baby will not eat; nurses who fail to feed Baby are fed to the Lion. As the following sequence shows, Jennie could have succeeded, but for her thoughtlessness: "My tail isn't breakfast," snarled Jennie. "Why didn't you say you were hungry? Here's some va- nilla pudding." Baby tried to get at it first and it fell on the floor. "Greedy," yapped Jennie as she pounced on the pudding. Baby rolled over on Jennie and when they came right side up, the pudding was gone. Jennie whimpered. "I've failed my experience! I didn't mean to eat the pudding. I hate vanilla pud- ding." (pp. 24, 26) In Jennie's actions one sees the Trick- ster whose hands may fight each other. Jennie is a Trickster out of control, and as a result she loses everything. On a larger, cosmic scale, Jennie is being tricked. The pig plays verbal tricks and cons Jennie, the cat subtly conveys Jennie to the White House, and Rhoda seems so obtuse that she takes metaphorical expressions literally while she leads Jennie to Baby's room. Lion and Baby are also involved, Lion as a snarling but ultimately harmless villain, and Baby as a tantrum-throwing avatar Let the Wild Rumpus Start! 391</page><page sequence="7">of Mother Goose. All of them bring Jen- nie to the looking-glass, so to speak, and after she sees herself in it, they receive her through it. Mother Goose, Baby metamorphosed into a protective woman whose face seems to Jennie the size of the moon, is the Trickster with the mag- ical name who reigns over story and play. Although the play retells the tale in pictures and pantomime (Bell 1968), it lacks the story's doubt and darkness. That happens because during the story Jennie does not know how to deal with her absurd situation. She is like modern man in whom, as Jung writes, the Trick- ster appears when man "feels himself at the mercy of annoying 'accidents' which thwart his will and his actions with ap- parent malicious intent" (McGuire et al. 1969, p. 262). Jennie's situation presents questions of epistemology, which are partly resolved by the moral about car- ing. But concerns go deeper. Since Sen- dak says that he wrote Higglety Pigglety Pop! while he was afraid that both his mother and Jennie were dying (Braun 1970), one can realize profound es- chatological questions lying beneath the story's surface. Those are closely linked with both Jennie's rebirth and the Trickster-like metamorphoses of Mother Goose. Turning to In the Night Kitchen (1970), one finds a much less somber tone. The book tells the story of Mickey who ob- tains milk for the morning cake. His ex- perience is frankly sensual, and, as Saul Braun says, Sendak portrays it in an "exultant tone" (1970, p. 43). Mickey's is the exultation of discovery and Tricksterish creativity. Mickey's story happens in the com- pany of three modern Tricksters, bakers who all resemble Oliver Hardy. We know what sort of behavior to expect from them - the bossiness and ill-temper of a spoiled child. Such behavior ap- pears, for instance, when they uncon- cernedly stuff Mickey into the cake bat- ter, and later when they run howling "Milk! Milk!" at Mickey the pilot. In that second scene, the bakers' chubby faces show infantile distress. Their white bak- ers' uniforms with large bows where the aprons are tied in back, their shortened bodies, and their enlarged heads add to their portrayal as infants. Mickey clearly is also a Trickster. He at times lacks control over himself, as the scenes of falling illustrate. He enjoys natural nakedness and sexual stimula- tion, facts emphasized by his pose when crowing as well as by the call's meaning as a sexual pun. Unfortunately some reactions to Mickey's exuberant sexual awakening make that seem his greatest claim to being a Trickster. It is not. Mickey is creative, and like some Trick- ster figures, his creativity has sexual overtones (McGuire et al. 1969). Further, Mickey becomes a hero because of his trick of getting milk. His heroism, again, is possible for the Trickster. The Mickey way happens to benefit someone, as the book's final emblematic page em- phasizes. Quite frankly, a psychological analysis of In the Night Kitchen would produce about the same results as are extant in studies of Hansel and Gretei. Like others of Sendak's protagonists who dominate lesser Tricksters, Mickey emerges as the bakers' leader. They lack his creativity, for they seem only slowly to comprehend the airplane that he makes from dough. They also lack his capacity for experience; his flight to the top of a tall milk bottle fills them with awe. They are stock characters. He is unique. The archetype of the Trickster offers a key to understanding Maurice Sendak's raucous, willful protagonists. As they appear, each one seeming like a reflec- 392 Language Arts</page><page sequence="8">tion of those preceding him or her, they point toward motifs of trickery in Sen- dak's work. Most pervasive is the motif of the journey that often includes the protagonist's domination of monsters or other Tricksters. Henderson (1964) re- fers to it as the hero-dragon battle, which a child may re-fight many times before he or she becomes an individual who lives free of parental expectations. Second, and related to it, is the Trick- ster's getting into trouble because of his or her very character. No real initiation happens, except in the case of Jennie, for the Trickster completes no assigned task and learns little or nothing from the experience. Finally, and all about equal in importance, appear the confidence game, the wild ritualistic dance, the shamanistic practice of magic, and the metamorphosis of physical appearance. Influenced by such motifs, the stories of Sendak's make-believe world are enjoy- able and humorous. Moreover, they have special value because they ac- knowledge and accept each Trickster who will read them. References Bell, Arthur. "An Affectionate Analysis of Higglety Pigglety Pop!"
