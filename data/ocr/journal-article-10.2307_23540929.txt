<plain_text><page sequence="1">POST-ING LIVES GILLIAN WHITLOCK This special issue of Biography may seem exotic. It engages with a series of concepts that are unusual in studies of life narrative: beginning with zoegra phy and ending with the anthropocene. It turns to scenes of auto/biographi cal expression that may seem bizarre: animalographies, bioart, narratives of chronic pain, autobiogeography. It embraces creatures, critters, produsers, and avatars. Its critical canon is not traditionally associated with studies of life narrative: Bruno Latour, Deleuze and Guattari, Cary Wolfe, Donna Har away, Rosi Braidotti, Jane Bennett, Neil Badmington, Judith Butler, Giorgio Agamben, among others. The critical issues, concepts, and contexts we en gage with in this issue, however, are anything but exotic—these are not ec centricities imported into the field from elsewhere in response to intellectual fashion. To the contrary: what it means to be human is a question that is fundamental to autobiographical narrative, and embedded in the history of autobiography in western modernity. Around posthumanism an assemblage of work is emerging that is important for critical work on life narrative now, and the essays in this special issue suggest why this is so. The absence of autobiography in mappings of posthumanism to date— and vice versa—is extraordinary.1 In her history of the field, Linda Anderson associates the formative autobiography criticism of the 1960s and '70s with an essentialist and Romantic notion of selfhood and authorship, and with the in dividualism and humanism of the European Enlightenment. Although some identify this subject as a straw man with a vastly simplified history (Adamson, Freadman and Parker; Halliwell and Mousley), the point remains that in the recent past this "sovereign subject" has been the focus of criticism that ques tions the singular "I" of the autobiographical pact, the fantasy of embodiment that is reproduced without attention to gendered, racialized, and sexed iden tities, and modes of embodiment and recognition as these are understood in terms of western humanism. Feminism, postcolonialism, poststructuralism, Biography 35.1 (Winter 2012) © Biographical Research Center</page><page sequence="2">vi Biography 35.1 (Winter 2012) queer theory, postmodernism, disability studies—all have influenced recent criticism by raising questions about the status of the human subject and sub jectivity. What distinguishes posthumanism from these adjacent and associ ated critical practices is its primary and definitive concern with the limits of the human.2 There is an uneasiness to this: the human subject remains vital for ethical and political reasons—in rights discourse, for example. Although, as Donna Haraway remarks, "nothing really convincingly settles the separa tion of human and animal" (152), autobiographical representations and criti cism frequently set out to do exactly this. The life of the autobiographical "self" is profoundly invested in the human. For this reason it is persistently haunted by its non-, in-, and sub-human other: the monstrous, the animal, the dead, the irrational, the primitive, the mechanical—these mark the limits of autobiography. The concept of "posthuman lives" is both provocative and contradic tory. It suggests that autobiographical engagements with nonhuman others, the changing parameters of "life" that extend agency to the lives of animals, machines, and things, the dramatic changes of embodiment and temporal ity that occur through self representation in new bio and media technolo gies, produce alternative approaches to self-recognition and the boundaries between self and others. We are, argues Wolfe, "not that 'auto-' of autobiog raphy that humanism 'gives to itself" (What 119). Katharine Hayles argues that the posthuman opens up some new ways of thinking about what "hu man" means: new kinds of cultural configurations that question the author ity of the coherent self that bears witness to a stable reality (285). However, the implications for thinking about the agency of specific autobiographical discourses—for imagining a testimony of things, as Jane Bennett invites us to do —are problematic. Notions of presence, truth, and origins are fundamen tal to the idea that testimony enables a speaking of truth to power, a remem brance of the dead, and a claim to the status of the human and the rights that fall from that. Hayles anticipates this: the posthuman does not mean the end of humanity or a turn to the antihuman, but it does offer resources for re thinking the liberal humanist view of the self, and it does signal the question ing of conceptions of the human that draw on hierarchies of speciesism and anthropocentrism, ideas "that may have applied, at best, to that fraction of humanity that had the wealth, power, and leisure to conceptualize themselves as autonomous beings exercising their will through individual agency and choice" (286). Two things follow from this. First, life narrative is caught up in the social history of this sovereign self: it has been central to understand ings of what counts as human and why, to the constant and relational making of "human" and "nonhuman." Second, it has a unique contribution to make</page><page sequence="3">Whitlock, Post-ing Lives vii to understandings of humanity as a shifting mode of being. For posthuman ism, "the human" is entangled variously in nature, culture, and technology; the state or condition of the human "being" is made, remade, unmade in proximity to a "widened field of alterity: animate and inanimate, natural and artificial, living and dead, organic and mechanistic" (Fuss 3). The limits of the human are a work in process.3 As Sidonie Smith suggests in the preamble to her essay here, posthuman ism gathers together multiple, overlapping, and sometimes discrepant fields of critical activity. It remains a contested term. Some of the most compelling studies that trigger rethinking on what "a life" means—Jane Bennett's Vi brant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things, for example—make no reference to posthumanism at all. Elsewhere, as in Cary Wolfe's What is Posthuman ism?, and Kay Anderson's Race and the Crisis of Humanism, the "post" marks a complex and ongoing engagement with the legacies of humanism. Smith, like several other contributors here, remarks that feminist, postcolonial, and queer theorists have been doing the work of posthumanist critique for some time. Andy Mousley is more direct: "The posthuman is a new term for an old problem, one that haunts the humanist tradition from whenever or wherever we think that tradition began" (99). This sense of the posthuman as belated recurs; the "post" is forever tied up with what it is "post-ing" (Badmington 20).4 Nevertheless, a productive contradiction and instability embedded in the conjunction of "posthuman" and "lives" remains, and energizes this spe cial issue. What is unsettled here is the certainty that tethers the narration of "lives" to the singular and anthropocentric embodiment of "a life." In questioning the life of the human being as a unique subject, posthumanism gestures to different conceptions of living and non living matter: "we may at first see only a world in our own image, but what appears next is a swarm of 'talented' and vibrant materialities (including the seeing self)" (Bennett 99). Elsewhere this questioning of persons and things is described in terms of "new" or "critical" materialisms: a return to the most fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the place of embodied humans within a mate rial world (Coole and Frost 3). This is the point of departure for Louis van den Flengel's essay, which turns from bios to zoe: the new assemblages of humans, animals, technology, and things in biotechnological art. The argument that art practices are "in terfaces," experimental sites where the limits of autobiographical discourses come into play, is well established (for example, Smith and Watson, Interfaces, "Rumpled"). What distinguishes van den Hengel's essay is its turn to art prac tices as material acts that continuously reconfigure the differential boundar ies of the human and the nonhuman—a turn to their shifting interrelations</page><page sequence="4">viii Biography 35.1 (Winter 2012) where the emphasis falls "on the politics of life itself as a relentlessly generative force" (Braidotti 206). Zoegraphy, a thinking on how to think and write a life that does not have any human body or self at it center, is a practice that makes new connections between bodies, species, and technologies. The embodied and embedded human being represented in autobiographical narrative be comes part of an assemblage of bodies, technologies, and matter—what van den Hengel terms "non-representational life-storying technology" (4). Zoeg raphy challenges humanist ideas of embodiment and subjectivity, and at the same time its "semi-living" artworks raise questions of ethics and compas sionate response as both artists and audience participate in ritualized acts of care and violence in an affective response to these nonhuman life forms. This questions identification and recognition based on a self/other relation: the human subject, argues van den Hengel, only emerges through a multiplicity of encounters in and through proximity to what it is not. Extending the writing of life, and art, into the posthuman in this way, fo cusing on the materiality of the body and its human and nonhuman affects, raises questions of embodiment, ethics, and affect as they are conventionally understood in terms of individual personhood and modes of recognition that privilege the sovereign self. In an account of his affective exchange with the art ist Marina Abramovic in her performance The Artist is Present, van den Hengel bears witness to the ways that performance art reframes biographical time and presence. In extending the concept of "autobiography" into this account of the posthuman, he argues for an understanding of performance art as simultane ously "fully autobiographical and radically a-personal" (15). This new materi alist notion of life as zoe takes the "life" of "life writing" "into the posthuman," "beyond the figure of the human organism, beyond the linear time of the biog raphy, and beyond the boundaries of individual personhood" (16). Julia Watson's essay on Bobby Baker's visual diary also turns to life and art, drawing self-portraiture into a posthuman frame. Watson begins with Cary Wolfe's provocative claim that the human is "at its core and in its very constitution, radically ahuman and constitutively prosthetic" {What xxvi). For Wolfe, the concept of the "ahuman" enables a reframing of human em bodiment in terms of the "prosthetic creature" (xxv). This radically disperses ways of thinking about the human. First, by turning to "creatures," it ques tions the distinctions between humans and the animal other that are asso ciated with speciesism. Second, by representing "embodiment" in terms of "prosthetics," it destabilizes the boundaries between bodies, technology, and matter. Watson's discussion of Baker's visual narrative of borderline personal ity disorder anticipates discussions of prosthetics and of illness in subsequent essays, where posthuman thinking on embodiment similarly questions the</page><page sequence="5">Whitlock, Post-ing Lives ix distinctions between life and matter, organic and inorganic, and human and animal.5 Baker's diary graphically redraws the boundaries of self-recognition, culminating in a final and brilliant recomposition and rearrangement of a self amidst a swarm of vibrant materialities. Van den Hengel's transformative experience of the artist's "durational presence" in performance occurred in the public galleries of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2010, unmediated by new technologies of any kind. In the first of two essays that consider new technologies and their impli cations in posthuman subjects, Tully Barnett discusses Melinda Rackham's web-based multimedia installation carrier (1998). Like The Artist is Present, carrier is an example of autobiographical artwork that challenges anthropo morphic conceptions of embodiment and agency; it was in fact one of the earliest examples of how digital technologies call into question the existence of the human as a stable and authentic being, predating (just) Hayles's How We Became Posthuman (1999). Rackham's "virus art" both "carries" the tes timonies of those infected by the Hepatitis C virus and is a "carrier," drama tizing the process of infection with a viral agent, "sHe," and using new tech nology to draw the reader/viewer into an intimate relation with others (those who testify to their experience of the virus) and with non human matter (the virus itself). Interactions between human, viral, and technological bodies are recast here. Although carrier remains barely alive on the World Wide Web now, incompatible with new browsers and platforms, it signals two vectors that have featured in a posthuman turn in life narrative: new technologies and illness narrative. These are the focus of subsequent essays, by Laurie Mc Neill and Leigh Gilmore respectively. The convergence of hypertext and vi rus in Rackham's artwork signals a further insight into "posthuman lives." Forms of life narrative that challenge anthropocentrism and incorporate hu man and non human "actants"6 and conceptions of the self as human-non human assemblage can generate powerful ethical responses of generosity and compassion even as they challenge humanist conceptions of self, life, em bodiment, agency, and matter. The essays that follow develop these issues, raising questions about trans formations of the self in forms of life narrative that turn to new technologies and compromised embodiments. In the decade since carrier, web-based tech nologies have become embedded in everyday life, no more so than in the com plex assemblage of Facebook. The singular and authentic self reproduced by the Facebook profile is, as McNeill remarks, a lucrative commodity. The pro jection of the humanist subject in and through the networked self shapes the complex grounds of "produsers" and "produsage"—a close embrace of corpo rate, technological, and autobiographical interests and concerns. The subject</page><page sequence="6">x Biography 35.1 (Winter 2012) of social networking sites, argues McNeill, is both consumer and product to be consumed. Whilst networking has the potential to transform experienc es of an embodied self as an assemblage of data and flesh, networked sites also reproduce attachments to an authentic self that is recreated and recy cled for both pleasure and profit. There is a strong association between new technologies and the emergence of new subjects and subjectivities in "popular posthumanism,"7 yet there is no necessary relation between "becoming post human" and social networking, and in fact, intensifications of a humanist imaginary and its commodification as global capital proliferate in cyberspace. In popular posthumanism, transformations of embodiment and tempo rality are almost always bioengineered by technology, with its capacity to generate avatars, mutations, cyborgs, and networks. Critical posthumanism, on the other hand, uses the "post" as an opportunity to open up critical spac es for productive re-engagement with humanist ethics, epistemology, and on tology in worlds that we occupy in real time and space. Leigh Gilmore makes this point in her reading of memoirs of chronic pain in terms that recognize the material agency of non-human things. Pain is an actant in this interpre tation, "a presence that coexists in and with and through the self," challeng ing what "embodiment" means (86-87). Her essay draws together a series of memoirs to consider the association of agency, humanity, and language with normative embodiment. Chronic pain shatters the self-sufficient and master ful "I" of life narrative, argues Gilmore. Pain narratives are a potent site for the recuperation of the humanist subject, and a critique of humanism's offer of mastery to normative subjects and withdrawal of agency, humanity, and language from others. This argument that chronic pain memoirs open up an expansive view of the agency of a networked subject turns not to technol ogy, but to Latour and Bennett to reframe the "I" of memoir with regard for non-human matter, and to Butler's work on "precarity" to consider the ethics of embodiment that is raised in this posthuman turn. What happens when agency is reframed in terms that theorize the human body as a porous ecosys tem? How can posthumanism address issues of suffering, pain, and loss, and the vulnerability of many humans? This is a vital question that recurs one way and another in this issue. Gilmore's concerns with the ethics of posthumanism, particularly its refor mulations of temporality, embodiment, and agency, are symptomatic of an ambivalence on "post-ing" the humanism of life narrative. What humanistic forms of critique should be salvaged and sustained, and what resources for po litical agency remain within humanism? Andy Mousley's response is unequiv ocal: the posthuman attends the human condition; it is a provocation within that "presses upon us the need to say again what we mean by humanism and</page><page sequence="7">Whitlock, Post-ing Lives xi the human" (113). His reading of Eva Hoffman's Lost in Translation argues for literary life writing as a uniquely powerful affective experience, particularly in the wake of inhumanity and social suffering. This claim echoes in the fol lowing essays on Dave Eggers's What Is the What by Michelle Peek and Si donie Smith's audacious framing of Mary Rowlandson's captivity narrative, first published in 1682, in terms of the posthuman witness. How do "post human lives" affirm the capacity to bear witness to trauma and suffering in the wake of genocide, colonization, and war? Can the subject positions of witness ing be rethought in posthuman terms? This issue begins with an extraordinary account of bearing witness—the phrase van den Hengel uses to describe his encounter with Abramovic, as he addresses the compassion and care evoked in response to the beings created by bioart. This approach reformulates recogni tion and compassion in posthuman terms, where "it becomes necessary and impossible to rewrite the default grammar of agency, a grammar that assigns activity to people and passivity to things" (Bennett 119). The essays on chron ic pain narratives, exilic memoir, refugee narratives, and captivity narrative, however, circle questions of agency and witness, of compassion and empathie engagement, with a concern for the long tradition that associates life narra tive, humanism, and social justice. This, too, is a legacy of western Enlighten ment thinking, which gave rise not only to the masterful "I" of autobiography but also to the collective "I" of testimony: both Rousseau's Confessions and Equiano's Interesting Narrative were published late in the eighteenth century. The humanist traditions of life narrative sustain both the singular and sov ereign autobiographical "I," the interior and introspective subject of literary autobiography, and the collective "I" of testimonial shaped by human rights discourse and humanitarianism. Marginal subjects "become" human in and through life narrative, and they testify on behalf of suffering others.8 It should be no surprise that the connection between witnessing and social responsibility becomes one of the points that "presses upon us to say again what we mean by the human and humanism." My own turn to consid ering the limits of the human in life narrative was not in response to theory. It occurred after reading testimonies by survivors of rape warfare in the Con go and asylum seekers held in mandatory detention close to home. Engaging with testimony and witnessing, I was struck by its constant circling of the limits of the human, and its precarious hold on "grievable life."9 Testimony draws deeply on traditions of humanitarianism and rights discourse, and it is frequently preoccupied with animality and abjection, and the constant negotiation of what it means to be human.10 If we understand critical post humanism to be concerned with the limits of the human, and the techno logical and cultural forces that produce and question the categories of "the</page><page sequence="8">xii Biography 35.1 (Winter 2012) human" and "the non human" (Simon 2), then it can be no surprise that a series of essays on posthuman lives that arise in very different contexts and texts—from a pre-Enlightenment Puritan captivity narrative to the contem porary Israeli/Palestinian conflict—converge on questions of social justice and bearing witness.11 For posthumanism, this ethical problem cannot be resolved by imagining a renovated anthropomorphic self (gendered, racialized, queered, hybrid)— the different subject and revised agency that emerges, variously, from femi nism, postcolonialism, new humanisms, and queer theory. Posthumanism reshapes the self and its interests as it ascribes vitality to nonhuman bodies, forces, and forms, "highlighting the common materiality of all that is" (Ben nett 122). It imagines agen tic assemblages, where human agency is entangled with the nonhuman in ways that call for new models of agency, recogni tion, and subjectification.12 For Rosi Braidotti, for example, adequately rec ognizing and responding to disturbing issues of suffering, loss, and pain, and the vulnerability of humans, produces an ethics of affirmation or affirmative compassion, as opposed to the moral pity of humanitarianism and rights dis course (210). This recalls where we began: van den Hengel's "zoegraphy," which turns aside from "bios" (a human-centered ethics) in favour of "zoe," a narrative not specific to human life worlds that associates humans, animals, machines, and things as vital materialities. This resonates with the many ways that vulnerability recurs in these essays. The final two essays in this special issue turn to species-thinking through the lens of the animal and of the anthropocene. Cynthia Huff and Joel Haefner's reading of agency and embodiment in animalographies, and Ro sanne Kennedy's reading of memoirs in terms of the new temporalities of the anthropocene, engage with proximities that question the "bios" of auto biography in terms of critical posthumanism. Huff and Haefner's focus on the animal productively recapitulates key issues in earlier essays. They ar gue, for example, that despite initial appearances, animalographies can be the grounds where humanist subjectivity is renewed—their reading of Bo Obama's blog resonates with McNeill's discussion of Facebook and the re newal of humanism in the interests of global capital through social network ing.13 Animalographies are also the grounds where rights discourse emerges and "exploits our expectations of what constitutes subjectivity just as it pre tends to push the boundaries of the human/animal divide" (160). Critical issues of agency and witnessing surface here in a very different register, as human rights are extended to animals without questioning the limitations of rights discourse as an ethical mode of inter-species understanding. Like Gilmore, Huff and Haefner associate humanism and life narrative with a</page><page sequence="9">Whitlock, Post-ing Lives xiii (gendered) desire for "mastery" that is profoundly disturbed by posthuman ism's distributed notions of agency and affect. The occasions when differ ent ethical and affective arrangements can come into play in life narrative, however, are elusive. By reading Donna Haraway's When Species Meet as an example of critical posthumanism (as opposed to the pseudo-posthumanism that is regularly co-opted by consumerism and rights discourse), Huff and Haefner contrast the appropriation of subjectivities of other species in ani malographies with the entangled and braided subjects that engage in Har away's relational narrative of companion species. Using the lens of the anthropocene, Kennedy also takes up this issue of species thinking, turning to "autobiogeography," which draws on genetics, ecology, and paleontology to challenge the temporal and embodied frame work of "bios." Both of these final essays question the capacity of life narrative to reach beyond speciesism. The anthropocene, a geological concept, refers to the disastrous impact of human population growth upon other species, and raises the question of planetary futures—with or without the human. Ken nedy returns to a recurrent theme of this issue: modes of recognition, and rights discourse. She argues that memoir can extend to conceptions of the human as embedded in the physical and natural world, to speak of ruined landscapes and human responsibility in non-anthropocentric and planetary terms. A comparative reading of W. G. Sebald's The Rings of Saturn and Raja Shehadeh's Palestinian Walks as "walking" memoirs raises questions about "humanity's footprint." Sebald's anthropocene imaginary disrupts familiar conceptions of individual personhood and the linear time of autobiography. On the other hand, the urgency of the Israeli/Palestinian struggle reveals the risks of abandoning rights discourse and its conception of the human in She hadeh's memoir, even as it seeks refuge and consolation in a planetary future beyond current political strife. Critical posthumanism is an opportunity to reconsider conceptions of the self that have been the doxa of autobiographical narrative and critique to date. Thinking in terms of posthuman lives troubles a number of the contrib utors to this special issue, and productively so. Autobiography is embedded in the personhood of western modernity, and posthumanism radically calls into question notions of matter, life, agency, and being that shape humanist understandings of this "bios." The debates about embodiment, temporality, and agency that percolate through this special issue on posthuman lives are a mark of the "post." This space of inquiry, theorizing, and contradiction is of ten signaled by a hyphen, slash, or space in the "posthuman." In the absence of these, it is the space between "posthuman" "lives" that becomes the pro ductive pause populated by these essays.</page><page sequence="10">xiv Biography 35.1 (Winter 2012) ACKNOWLEDGMENTS My thinking on posthumanism and life narrative is indebted to discussions about new directions in autobiography criticism at the International Auto/ Biography Association 2008 conference in Hawai'i; the "Emergence of the Posthuman Subject" conference at the University of Surrey in 2010; and at the Humanities Research Centre at the Australian National University in 2009. Most of all, this Introduction draws on the discussions with the con tributors to this volume in a seminar hosted by the Center for Biographical Research at the University of Hawai'i at Mànoa in September 2011. All of us have benefitted from this exchange. As coeditors Tom and I thank our contributors for their patience, gener osity, and the intellectual labor that has gone into these essays. On behalf of all of us, we acknowledge the commitment to fostering new scholarly work in life narrative and the extraordinary initiative and support of the Center for Biographical Research that has produced this special issue. NOTES This continues even in recent literary overviews, such as Wallace. Jill Didur makes the point that critical posthumanism is an interdisciplinary perspective that is informed by poststructuralism, postmodernism, feminist and postcolonial stud ies, and science and technology studies. Wolfe contests the fantasy of the posthuman described by Hayles as a triumphant tran scendence of embodiment; to the contrary, "it requires us to attend to that thing called 'the human' with greater specificity, greater attention to embodiment, embeddedness, and materiality, and how these in turn shape and are shaped by consciousness, mind, and so on" ( What 120). Badmington draws on Lyotard to argue that the "post"of posthumanism does not (and cannot) mark or make an absolute break from the legacy of humanism: '"Post-'s speak (to) ghosts, and cultural criticism must not forget that it cannot simply forget the past. The writing of the posthumanist condition should not seek to fashion 'scriptural tombs' for humanism, but must, rather, take the form of a critical practice that occurs inside humanism, consisting not in the wake but the working-through of humanist discourse" (22). Badmington pursues the co-presence of humanism and posthumanism by reading traces of latent humanism in the radical posthuman feminist scholar Donna Haraway, and he finds a latent critique of humanism in Descartes. Wolfe also turns to Lyotard on the question of the "post" to make the point that the posthuman comes both after (chronologically) and before (as a material, embodied condition of possibility) the hu man of humanism {What 121). See the essays by Leigh Gilmore, and by Cynthia Huff and Joel Haefner. The term is Bruno Latour's, and it refers to sources of agency that can be either human or nonhuman.</page><page sequence="11">Whitlock, Post-ing Lives xv Bart Simon separates "popular posthumanism" and "critical posthumanism." The for mer is characterized by the lure of new social entities (cyborgs, artificial intelligence, second life) composed of fluid, flexible, and changeable identities. For popular post humanism, the future is a space for the transcendence of biological limits, as circulated through popular films such as the Matrix and Alien franchises, and expansive agendas for biotechnology (2). For a recent discussion of humanism and the "limited economy of sympathy," see Bourke. Introduced as a topic of discussion about new directions in criticism at the LABA 2008 conference at the University of Hawai'i, and subsequently in an article on testimony from the Congo. As Wolfe suggests, it is crucial to pay attention to the discourse of animality quite irre spective of the issue of how non-human animals are treated, because that discourse "has historically served as a crucial strategy in the oppression of humans by other humans." The difference between humanity and animality is endemic to the bestialization of indi viduals and racialized groups {Zoontologiesxx). For further discussion of how contemporary human rights values, norms, and standards relate to posthumanism, see Baxi. See, for example, Kelly Oliver's discussion of how recognition and ethics based on al terity and difference is transformed by considering animals: "our entire conception of rights, based as it is on assumptions about autonomous human individuals, is altered by animal pedagogy and animal kinship. We must consider our notions of autonomy and freedom in relation to animals and ourselves . . . the very conception of 'ourselves' and 'we' comes under scrutiny" (22). As Neil Badmington remarks, much that goes by the name of posthumanism and claims to be terminating "Man" actually extends "his" term in office (16). There has been a remarkable turn to the lives of things in recent memoir. There are, for example, biogra phies of cancer, oysters, and nutmegs, as well as the numerous animalographies that are the subject of Huff and Haefner's essay. Few of these seriously challenge anthropomor phism and speciesism, or engage in what Huff and Haefner speak of as the umweltoi the animal.
