<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Bones of the Serpent: Person, Memory and Mortality in Sabarl Island Society. By Debbora Battaglia. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 1990. Pp. x + 253. On the Bones of the Serpent is an ethnography of Sabarl, an island Austronesian society in the Cal- vados Chain, located off the southeast corner of New Guinea. This book is a rarity among contem- porary ethnographies in that it presents a single, coherent formulation of the sociocultural order. Each retelling of an episode from daily life, each citation of traditional narrative, each iconographic interpretation, and each analysis of social perfor- mance has a carefully calculated place in the overall argument. Sabarl, a 'rocky place' upon which a human population survives only through hard work, can best be understood by seeing people, exchange valuables and food as related through a logic of 'personification', according to which positive acts of human reproduction, image construction and agricultural production function to reify or embody the agents of these activities. As these three ele- ments become further 'written' in social transac- tions of nurturance, gift-giving and feasting, the resulting artifacts 'mark' the memory of their source only by distancing, substituting, displacing, or deconstructing it But for the Sabarl, this 'nega- tive absence', revealed most clearly at the asymptote of social action, namely, death rituals 75</page><page sequence="2">Reviews and also in other deconstructive acts such as aliena- tion and consumption, makes possible a finality which is in fact regenerative. New people (and new interpersonal relations), new forms of wealth (and new debt relations), and new food products are possible only by an official * forgetting* of the original values brought to a closure. Fundamental to Battaglia's model is the claim that 'textuality', that great object of desire of modern symbolic analysis, is not inherently logocentric. In the Sabarl case, visual signs encode a permanence that other scholars - most curiously - assign only to language. Battaglia brilliantly decodes the iconography of objects in Sabarl society, including axe blades, canoes, and shell necklaces, and shows that these objects serve as 'kinetic' vehicles of personification through a process of anthropomorphic analogy. The under- standing of visual representation, thus, requires a grasp of the 'metaphysics' of personhood. In several closely related chapters, Battaglia examines the nature of the Sabarl 'self in terms of a series of correlative distinctions such as spirits and ances- tors, stability and mobility, bone and flesh, dry and greasy food, all of which point toward a 'relational* personality construct. Just as objects acquire value through collective memorialization, the self develops through social relations of support, invest- ment, indebtedness, respect, and cooperation. In the end, Battaglia is able to explain the link between the disharmonic regime of Sabarl social life, creating an inevitable tension between 'blood' and 'place' (found also in the Trobriands as well as in Belau), and this 'projective' personhood, entail- ing the complementarity not only of male and female, paternals and maternals but also consan- guines and affines, 'deconstructivist' patricians and 'conventionalist' matriclans, seniors and juniors. The interaction of persons, exchange objects, and food culminates in the sequence of funeral and mourning rites, which Battaglia analyzes in an ar- gument that spirals toward greater abstraction. Not only are valuables iconically constructed as sub- stitutes for the deceased and this mimetic image then indexically anchored to the decaying corpse, but the ritual sequence as an intertextual whole recapitulates in time the very morphology of the human body. In the 'concluding note' Battaglia writes: Yet for Sabarl, 'finishing' is more than a matter of 'forgetting' or 'killing' the dead. The process goes beyond cancelling out objectifica- tions of the dead as bodily beings and the 'fall- ing apart of social ties and selves' ... In this respect, editing a memory out produces ... a positively valued negative space. Meaning, that is, is not 'killed' or cancelled by successive meanings, stories by successive stories, images by successive images. Rather, previous writ- ings remain an active absence beneath or alongside the masks of superseding ones. New stories occur, new signs or texts are produced over and around (in respect of, informed by, in spite of) their antecedents. And in an act of congruency with their ancestors, the living make statements and gestures about surviving in spite of having 'finished' - selectively and officially forgotten - that part of themselves that is 'present in absentia' (p. 196). This is cultural analysis at its highest level. The book succeeds in 'memorializing' a group of Melanesian ancestral spirits such as Marilyn Strathern, Nancy Munn, Roy Wagner and Annette Weiner, whose work is constructively transcended. One might ask, however, to what degree deconstruction, intertextuality, supplementation, writing, obviation, personification, memorializa- tion and dissemination - to cite several frequently used concepts drawn from the pages of contem- porary Western theory - correspond to local cul- tural awareness. And one hopes that in subsequent writing Battaglia will connect her argument about memory more explicitly to Sabarl society's coding of their history. RICHARD J.
