<plain_text><page sequence="1">Outside My Window, by Liesel Moak Å korpen, New York : Harper &amp; Row, 1968, $2.50. "A little boy was going to bed. He looked out the window and saw there, looking at him, a small bear." In the most direct, simple and fanciful way the boy attempts to help the bear feel comfortable and at home since doubtful parents offer no assistance. The story un- folds with charm and honesty without sap- py anthropomorphism or unrealistic child desires to be all-providers to poor homeless animals. The boy tries to help with all the understanding and empathy he knows but in vain and the bear is kindly, sweetly given his freedom in the end. The illustrations are lovely, realistic drawings well suited to the text and togeth- er they produce a book that comes across as a tender and sensitive story. The author clearly has a deep understanding of both children and animals. Ann Goldsmith Wheelock College Boston, Massachusetts</page></plain_text>
