<plain_text><page sequence="1">RALPH BEHRENS Collapse of Dynasty: The Thematic Center of Absalom, Absarlon! THE FOCAL FIGURE in William Faulk- ner's Absalom, Absalom! is Thomas Sutpen, who, "Out of quiet thunderclap . . . would abrupt (man-horse-demon)" into the town of Jefferson, Mississippi, one day in 1833 to set about carrying out a "design" he had in mind.1 What his design was, his method of accomplishing it, and its failure or fall, as well as possible reasons for the failure, are the concern of four characters through whose words the reader learns, frag- mentarily and not in chronological sequence, about Sutpen's career. These four characters, Miss Rosa Coldfield, Mr. Compson, his son Quentin Compson, and Quentin's Canadian roommate at Harvard, Shreve, all try, in their various ways, through what they have seen or heard, and through whatever insight their own particular psyches enable them to perceive, to explain the Sutpen phenomenon. The problems of explanation beset not only these four characters but also the critics of Absalom, Absalom! Among the several problems, the most prominent ap- pears to be finding the reason for the failure of Sutpen's design, since much of the thematic im- port of the novel hinges upon that discovery. At least four possible theories may be advanced to account for the failure of Sutpen's design and the collapse of his dynastic dreams. The first key to understanding the collapse may lie in Sutpen's innocence of the ways of the society in which he attempts to carry out his design; or, his failure may be due to a kind of hubris, similar to that of the heroes of Greek tragedy; or again, the failure may lie in the very society itself which he attempts to join and emulate, the pre-Civil War South of the plantation system with its concomitant evils; or, finally and most satisfactorily, the failure may be equated with the failure of dynasties of ancient times illustrated in the prophetic books of the Old Testament, where failure appears to lie in the dynastic concept itself. These theories are not mutually exclusive and may even lend support to one another, but the title of the novel, taken as it is from II Samuel xiii.33, constitutes a strong indi- cation that Faulkner expected his readers to find significance in the parallels between his story and the account of the House of David. The total esthetic and moral triumph of the novel, and its thematic significance, may be clarified by examin- ing the four theories in the order named. Sutpen may certainly be understood as a kind of innocent. Not until the middle of the novel, however, does the reader learn of his innocent background, which, on one occasion, Sutpen had told to Quentin's grandfather. Sutpen had been born of poor white stock in the mountains of western Virginia, and had lived his early childhood in that still natural, unsophisticated society. Every- one lived in log cabins, had numerous progeny; no one owned any more property than perhaps a rifle; and there were no Negroes. The land, Quentin says, remembering what he has been told, "belonged to anybody and everybody and so the man who would go to the trouble and work to fence off a piece of it and say 'This is mine' was crazy" (p. 221). In such a society, Quentin con- tinues to explain, imagining the situation through Sutpen's innocent mind, only a crazy man "would go to the trouble to take or even want more than he could eat or swap for powder and whiskey" (p. 221); everybody had those things he was strong enough to take. In his naivete, Sutpen failed to recognize the paradox, apparent even in that unsophisticated society, that strength to seize what one merely wants is sometimes a powerful force which supersedes contentment with what one simply needs. It never occurred to the young Sutpen, in those surroundings, that any man would take advantage of "a blind accident" such as authority, "to look down at others" (p. 222). During Sutpen's youth, however, his father de- cided to move back east, down the mountains, into 24</page><page sequence="2">Ralph Behrens the Tidewater area. As the family descended the mountains, young Sutpen became gradually aware that the land was divided and marked off; for the first time he learned that there were people who had other people to do personal service for them and that some men had the power of life and death over others, even the power to buy and sell them. He learned "the difference not only be- tween white men and black men, but he was learning that there was a difference between white men and white men" (p. 226). The father took a job as a kind of overseer on one of the plantations. When, one day, the boy Sutpen was sent to the rich man's big white house to deliver a message, he went to the front door, in all innocence, where he was met by a Negro in livery who would not even allow him to state his message, but told him to go to the back door. It was this incident, along with others, which set the young Sutpen to thinking that he must do some- thing in order "to live with himself for the rest of his life" (p. 234). His thinking led him to run away from home and ultimately to form his "de- sign" to take, by strength and will, that which he desired. One critic sees Sutpen's descent from the moun- tains as a kind of symbolic descent from an Edenic paradise to a lower kind of life, thus sug- gesting the theme of innocence and the fall from it.2 Cleanth Brooks, however, is the chief pro- ponent of the innocence theory.3 Brooks bases his thesis on Mr. Compson's statement that "Sutpen's trouble was innocence" (p. 220). That particular innocence, says Brooks, lay in Sutpen's concept of the nature of reality, particularly the reality of the Southern society which he later at- tempted to join (Brooks, p. 296). Sutpen was innocent of the mores of the Old South which the people liked to think of as traditional; therefore, Sutpen was suspect by the Southerners because he did not understand their background, in which "the past was important, blood was important" (Brooks, p. 297). Sutpen, Brooks continues, be- lieved that the mere "fetish objects" of Southern aristocracy were enough and that, if necessary, it was all right to gain them by sheer ruthlessness. "For him," Brooks contends, "the tradition is not a way of life 'handed down' or 'transmitted' from the community, past and present, to the individual nurtured by it. It is an assortment of things to be possessed, not a manner of living that embodies certain values and determines men's conduct" (p. 298). An objection to Brooks's theory may be that by the time Sutpen arrived at Jefferson, he had had enough experience in the ways of the plantation system to gain some knowledge of its values and shibboleths. He had, after leaving Virginia, gone to Haiti, where he had become an overseer on a sugar plantation belonging to a Frenchman. After a slave rebellion, in which Sutpen was responsible for repulsing the slaves and saving the life and home of the Frenchman, he was offered the Frenchman's daughter in marriage. A son was born of that marriage, and it had seemed for a time that Sutpen had realized his ambitions and had, for all practical purposes, established his dynasty. But when he discovered that there was some Negro blood in his wife's veins, he left her and the son. He had come to know enough about a dynastic tradition to know that the, wife could never be "adjunctive or incremental to the design" (p. 240). Cleanth Brooks feels, however, that Sutpen's unwillingness to accept his first wife and her son, Charles Bon, may not arise from any par- ticular social feeling but merely from a recognition that others would not accept his son. Brooks backs up this argument with the rather telling fact that Sutpen treats the French architect, whom he has brought to Jefferson to plan his house, essentially as a slave, so that color did not make any differ- ence to him at all. His ruthlessness in carrying out his design was all cerebral and rational, says Brooks; respectability and morality were mere abstractions (Brooks, pp. 298-301). And there is, perhaps, a kind of innocence in presuming that rationality and drive, without regard to emotional and moral considerations, can be relied upon to carry a design through. Brooks's arguments are at least partially tenable and may serve as a fairly acceptable explanation for the failure of Sutpen's dream of dynasty. The second explanation that may be offered for the failure of the completion of the design is Sutpen's hubris, which is comparable to that of the protagonists in Greek tragedy. Here again, the tragedy grows out of a personal shortcoming, one rather closely related to Sutpen's innocence. There are enough references to Greek tragic and mythical figures in Faulkner's novel to lend credence to the feeling that Faulkner himself, or at least other characters in the novel, saw Sutpen 25</page><page sequence="3">The Thematic Center of Absalom, Absalom! as analogous in some ways to the ancient Greek heroes. Sutpen's half-white daughter, for instance, is named Clytemnestra (Clytie); Miss Rosa is re- ferred to twice as a possible Cassandra (pp. 60, 177); Shreve at one point likens Sutpen to Aga- memnon (p. 177); and Mr. Compson, during his narration, says he feels that Sutpen's face must have been something "like the mask in Greek tragedy" (p. 62). There is, furthermore, a strong indication in the novel that fate plays a con- siderable hand in Sutpen's downfall, as it did in the lives of Greek heroes. And again, as in Greek tragedy, much of the action seems predestined, perhaps because the reader knows quite early in the novel many of the disasters that will occur late in the chronology of the story. Sutpen certainly has something of the qualities of a great tragic hero; he is "larger than life," at least in the minds of Miss Rosa, Quentin, and Shreve, who view his career with considerable awe. Furthermore, he has proved himself a com- petent leader in the Civil War, and his heroism there makes him somewhat analogous to the Greek hero. One critic, for instance, has drawn rather tentative comparisons between the Sutpen story and the story of the House of Atreus; Sut- pen's rejection of his eldest son, Charles Bon, is seen as equivalent to Agamemnon's sacrifice of one of his daughters. In both cases, says the critic, the father performed what he apparently thought were justifiable actions for preserving his house, his dynasty.4 Another scholar (allowing the possibility that Faulkner may have used the Oedipus cycle in drafting the plot of his novel) suggests similarities between Oedipus and Sutpen, between Eteocles and Polyneices and Sutpen's sons, and between Antigone and Judith.5 The sins of the fathers, it is true, fall on Sutpen's children as on the children of Agamemnon and of Oedipus. That Sutpen is guilty of hubris is undeniable, even if one is inclined to call that quality, in mod- ern times, mere hardheadedness. He can never admit the possibility of a flaw in his own character, nor in the design he has planned. In speaking to Mr. Compson of the failure of his Haitian attempt at founding a dynasty, Sutpen says merely that he had a design in mind. "Whether it was a good or a bad design," Sutpen continues, "is beside the point; the question is, Where did I make the mis- take in it, what did I do or misdo in it, whom or what injure by it to the extent which this would indicate" (p. 263). There lies in this speech the arrogance of too little consideration of the moral- ity of his design and its possible effect on others. Though he may wonder if he has made a wrong turning here or there, Sutpen never considers the possibility that the design, which became the es- sence of the man himself, might contain the moral flaw that would bring doom to it.6 Miss Rosa sees the hubris in Sutpen. She speaks in one instance of "the accelerating circle's fatal curving course of his ruthless pride" (p. 162). The theory that Sutpen's failure is a result of hubris, a theory that has led critics to find anal- ogies to Greek tragedy, has its shortcomings, noted rather tellingly by Irving Howe. What pre- vents Sutpen from rising to the heights of tragic greatness is "a failure of self-recognition," says Howe, who then remarks that "few tragic heroes fall as low as Sutpen, selling candy sticks in a backwoods store, drinking with Wash Jones, try- ing to perpetuate his line through Wash Jones's daughter [sic]."7 Even so, Sutpen impresses the reader with some of the stature and tragic dignity of the hero of a Greek drama. The third explanation for the fall of Sutpen's proposed dynasty centers in the theory that the design is representative, in a microcosmic way, of those principles upon which the Old South built its social system. This theory implies that Faulkner's account of Sutpen's rise and fall is an allegory of the rise and fall of the South. Such a theory seems, at first glance, to be the easiest of all to accept, since the general twentieth-century view is that slavery was wrong and that the medieval social structure of the Southern plantation system could not help but fall because of what is now considered its morally erroneous foundation. Certainly, most of Sutpen's design includes those things which the Southern plantation owner took for granted: money, land, a great and imposing house, slaves, a respectable wife, and sons to carry on the aristocratic tradition, the dynasty. It does not matter whether the design is inherited or self-created, says Olga Vickery, in equating Sutpen with all Southern plantation owners.8 Vickery is of the opinion that "Sutpen himself is a mirror image of the South, for his career in Jefferson merely repeats in a foreshortened form the rise of 26</page><page sequence="4">Ralph Behrens many families whose longer tenure of the land has given them respectability" (The Novels of William Faulkner, p. 93). Sutpen's establishment of his own dynastic power proceeds in this way: he acquires money (though it is never explained how he got the initial money, the Spanish coins); with this money he buys a hundred square miles of land from the Indians; he sets his twenty slaves (and an in- explicably acquired French architect) to building a great house with bricks fired on the site; when the house is completed, he brings all the appro- priate furnishings for it-mirrors, silver, chan- deliers, mahogany furniture, rugs (though it is suspected by the inhabitants of Jefferson that he stole these things from steamboats); he acquires a respectable, though not an aristocratic, wife, Ellen, through an incompletely explained "deal" with a Mr. Coldfield; by force of will, hard work, and driving his slaves, he makes the plantation produce and become profitable; he has a son, Henry, and a daughter, Judith (though he has also sired a half-white daughter, Clytie, who is a house- servant); he sends his son to the University of Mississippi; he fights valiantly for the Southern cause during the Civil War and becomes a colonel. Do not these actions (if one disregards the paren- thetic comment) sound fairly typical of the way any aristocrat, including the Southerner, achieves his initial status? At any rate, there comes a time when the other inhabitants of Jefferson finally accept him, in spite of his early unrespectable behavior and his still somewhat bourgeois manner. But apparently something went wrong with the South; and things begin to interfere with Sutpen's very nearly completed design, his almost-estab- lished dynasty. The son brings home with him from the university a young man, Charles Bon, with whom the daughter falls in love. Sutpen recognizes Bon as his own son, the one born in Haiti of a woman who is part Negro; for this reason, Sutpen cannot officially acknowledge the son nor allow the marriage of Bon to his daughter. Sutpen tries to convince the son Henry that the marriage must be prevented; but Henry's friend- ship and love for Bon prevent his taking the steps necessary to stop the marriage; Henry renounces his heritage and leaves with Bon to fight in the war. Only at the end of the war, when they both return to the ruined plantation, does Henry see that decisive action must now be taken to prevent Bon and Judith's marriage, and so shoots Bon and flees. (It is never clear whether Henry's de- cision to kill Bon, rather than allow the marriage to take place, is the result of the knowledge that Bon is Judith's half-brother, or that Bon already is married morganatically to an octoroon in New Orleans, or that there is a tinge of Negro blood in Bon, or a combination of all these.) Sutpen is left without a proper male heir to carry on his dynasty. Since his wife Ellen has died during the war, he proposes to her sister Rosa that she try breeding with him, and if their child is a son, they will be married. Miss Rosa of course refuses, since that proposal is the final and un- deniable evidence to her of the absence of all humanistic and moral concern in Sutpen's pursuit of his ambitions. Sutpen, now growing old and realizing that he has not many more chances of begetting a son, finally seduces the granddaughter of Wash Jones, a poor white who lives in a fishing- shack on the land; but the child she bears is a daughter and Sutpen rejects both mother and child. In anger over this indifference, Jones kills Sutpen with a scythe which lies handy near the cabin. Thus the Sutpen dynasty comes to an end with two female heirs (one white and unmarried, the other half-Negro) and a part-Negro idiot grandchild of Charles Bon living in the decaying house. Years later, the house is to be set afire deliberately by the half-Negro daughter, Clytie, in an effort to protect Henry, returned home to die, from arrest for Bon's murder. Such a synopsis may help one decide if Sutpen's story can, in any way, be taken as "a tragic fable of Southern history."9 The theory has proved attractive; it is the one most frequently subscribed to by Faulkner's critics.10 Apparent in Sutpen's career and in the Old South's traditions are greed- iness and the failure to recognize the humanity of Negroes as well as the humanity of the poor whites, coupled with a desire to perpetuate the inhumane caste system. Perhaps these are the flaws which inevitably brought about the ruin of both. That Sutpen is largely representative of the planter of the Old South may be a disagreeable idea to those who choose to "romanticize" Southern tradition. In fact, Faulkner seems in Absalom, Absalom! to imply a distinction between 27</page><page sequence="5">28 The Thematic Center Sutpen and such people as the Compsons. Perhaps one half of Faulkner's self was realistic enough to think of Sutpen as fairly characteristic of most plantation owners; on the other hand, there was another half of Faulkner which wanted to believe that kindness, gentleness, and a sense of re- sponsibility toward other human beings, both slave and poor white, were exemplified in the best examples of traditional Southern aristocrats. Though, as one critic notes, Quentin may represent Sutpen to his Canadian roommate Shreve as representative of the Old South, even Quentin realizes that Sutpen was in many ways outside the tradition, that he defied the traditional com- munity, and that he was ignorant of, or lived out- side of, its codes and customs.1" Cleanth Brooks warns that the novel should not be given an "overshallow sociological interpretation" and that there is a difference between Sutpen and people like the Compsons (Brooks, p. 305). He feels that the breakup of the Compson family does not come from the failure of Sutpen's design, but rather from overrefinement, and that Mr. Comp- son's virtues and vices are diametrically opposed to those of Sutpen (Brooks, p. 307). In spite of the tendency to romanticize Southern aristocracy, as Brooks tends to do and as Faulkner may have done, one must take into account what W. J. Cash has to say about the type of plantation owners to be found in what he calls the "great South" as opposed to the Virginia planters. It was not until 1820, says Cash, that such areas as Mississippi began to develop the plantation sys- tem; until then the country was frontier. The forty-year span from 1820 to the beginning of the Civil War is equivalent to the lifetime of only a single generation. One must, therefore, says Cash, realize that the greater part of the South was not far removed from the frontier stage by the time the Civil War began, and there would hardly have been time for a rich tradition of aristocracy to develop. There is little indication, Cash contends, that many members of the cavalier English aris- tocracy came to this part of the country.12 Indeed, says Cash, "Nine-tenths of the men who would direct the affairs of the Confederate government, like nine-tenths of the men who would officer its armies, would be, not colonial aristocrats, but new people" (Cash, p. 61). If this be true, then it must be granted that the greater number of Mississippi plantation owners were, after all, relative new- of Absalom, Absalom! comers, men who had come from the low and middle classes, and some of whom may, like Sutpen's father, have come from the debtor's prison, Old Bailey.13 Cash's evidence indicates, then, that the theory that Sutpen is representative of the Southern planter holds good in general and that, in explaining the fall of Sutpen's dynasty, Quentin may very well have made the right choice to explain the Old South to Shreve. The fourth method of viewing the founding and fall of dynasties, that is, through biblical analogy, is brought to the reader's attention very early in the novel. Within the first two paragraphs of Absalom, Absalom! Faulkner establishes a biblical tone through the choice of words. Whether these words are Faulkner's or Quentin's or Miss Rosa's is often unclear. Though quotation marks or italics usually indicate Miss Rosa's exact speech, Quentin's recollection of her story is frequently couched in the same phraseology which the reader comes to associate with Rosa. In the second para- graph, for instance, when the reader may be as- suming that he is reading the words of the omni- scient author, the biblically flavored language of Miss Rosa slips in unobtrusively. Someone (the reader is not yet aware that it is Sutpen) will . . . overrun suddenly the hundred square miles of tranquil and astonished earth and drag house and formal gardens violently out of the soundless Noth- ing and clap them down like cards upon a table be- neath the up-palm immobile and pontific, creating Sutpen's Hundred, the Be Sutpen's Hundred like the oldentime Be Light. (pp. 8-9) There is the unmistakable reference to Genesis in the description of Sutpen's "creating" by force of sheer will, out of the void, a plantation, much as God is said to have brought the Creation into being. Again, in italics, indicating that the words are Miss Rosa's, such phrases as "begot a son and a daughter" and "the jewels of his pride and the shield and comfort of his old age" (p. 9) suggest biblical analogy. The tone and flavor of the Old Testament con- tinue to pervade Absalom, Absalom! War and violence, lust and murder, hatred and revenge, sin and retribution, pride and ignominious defeat- all these themes thread their way through Faulk- ner's novel as they do through those books of the Old Testament referred to generally as the his- torical and prophetic books. Just as these books of the Bible are concerned with the early days of</page><page sequence="6">Ralph Behrens the institution of kingship among the people of Israel, so Absalom, Absalom! deals with the at- tempt of Thomas Sutpen to found a dynasty in the Old South. If corroboration of the theory of biblical analogy is needed, Faulkner himself has supplied it. He stated at the University of Virginia that he had taken his title for the novel from the passage in the Bible found in II Samuel; when asked if he wrote the novel first and then thought of the title, or vice versa, Faulkner said that the idea of the novel and the choice of its title were simul- taneous.14 At the Nagano conference in Japan, Faulkner was questioned about his reading; and he named, among other books that he read, the Bible: "I read the Old Testament, oh, once every ten or fifteen years."15 Later at Nagano, when asked to comment further on his reading of the Old Testament, Faulkner answered: . . to me the Old Testament is some of the finest, most robust and most amusing folklore I know. The New Testament is philosophy and ideas, and some- thing of the quality of poetry. I read that too, but I read the Old Testament for the pleasure of watching what these amazing people did, and they behaved so exactly like people in the 19th century behaved. I read that for the fun of watching what people do. (Faulkner at Nagano, pp. 45-46) Despite some lightness of tone in Faulkner's answer, the truth probably is that Faulkner, through his Southern background (whether middle-class or aristocratic), took the Old Testa- ment quite seriously, perhaps sometimes un- consciously so. It is entirely appropriate that he should present much of the speech and the moral- ity of Miss Rosa in the language and actions that reflect the Old Testament. W. J. Cash again serves as verification for the authenticity of such a presentation. The average Southerner, says Cash, was likely to be a Puritan, deriving most of his religious ideas from the Protestant theology of the sixteenth century and from the moral code of the seventeenth-century Dissenters. The South- erner required, Cash continues: A faith to draw men together in hordes, to terrify them with Apocalyptic rhetoric, to cast them into the pit, rescue them, and at last bring them shouting into the fold of Grace. A faith, not of liturgy and prayer book, but of primitive frenzy and the blood sacrifice.... The God demanded was an anthropomorphic God- the Jehovah of the Old Testament: a God who might be seen, a God who had been seen. A passionate, whimsical tyrant, to be trembled before, but whose favor was the sweeter for that. (Cash, pp. 56, 58) Rosa Coldfield's Puritan-Methodism serves as a focal moral point of view through which the reader sees the rise and fall of Sutpen's dynasty. Hers is the first voice recognized distinctly in the novel, and though the moral tone of that voice is modified by other views (Mr. Compson's, par- ticularly), the tone recurs again and again, per- meating the novel. Though Miss Coldfield's nar- rative may be thought of as melodramatic and gothic, it reflects the melodrama and the goth- icism of the Old Testament, particularly the books of the elder prophets. One of Faulkner's critics warns against "unsophisticated Christian read- ings" of the novels,16 but he admits that the Christian moral view is given esthetic embodiment ;r Absalom, Absalom! (Hunt, p. 135) and notes that even Quentin is "a puritan moralist" (Hunt, p. 115). Obvious analogies between circumstances and events in Absalom, Absalom! and those in I Samuel and II Samuel will occur to the reader. David's rise to kingship in many ways parallels Sutpen's rise, and David's unhappy later days suggest many of the horrifying events that bring Sutpen's dynasty to an early end. Lawrance Thompson notes a number of these analogies briefly (pp. 64-65). However, analogies other than Thompson's deserve recognition and com- ment. Sutpen, like David, was sent, during his youth, on an errand which changed his entire career. In the case of David, who was normally engaged in tending sheep for his father, Jesse, the boy was sent to King Saul with gifts of bread, wine, and a kid; Saul was attracted by his good looks and asked that he be allowed to join the court. Sutpen's youth in the Virginia mountains is comparable to David's life as a shepherd, but ironically, his errand to a "royal" house brings about rejection from, rather than acceptance into, that higher social stratum. Even so, the result of the errand for Sutpen was also a new way of life, born of a determination to create a design and establish a dynasty of his own. While still a youth, David slew Goliath, the Philistine enemy of King Saul, whom no others of the warriors dared to engage in conflict. David's 29</page><page sequence="7">The Thematic Center of Absalom, Absalom! success brought him increased favor in Saul's court. Sutpen, comparably, drove away the mu- tinous Negro slaves from the Frenchman's sugar plantation in Haiti, thereby gaining favor for him- self in a "royal" house. As a reward for slaying Goliath, David had been promised Saul's older daughter in marriage, but Saul gave that daughter to someone else and David was married to another of Saul's daughters. Saul's jealousy of David's popularity with the people caused Saul to attempt to murder David; as a result, David left his wife and fled to another country. Sutpen, similarly, was married to the daughter of the French plantation owner, and though there is no question of his having been promised one daughter and given another, Sutpen felt that the wife he had acquired had been married to him under false pretenses, since he had not been told until later that she had some Negro blood. Sutpen, therefore, like David, gave up his first wife, left the "royal" house, and sought a new life elsewhere. Somewhat incongruously from the analogical point of view, but nevertheless important, Saul's son Jonathan and David formed an extremely close friendship, one so deep that Jonathan helped David against Saul, even after being warned by his father that allowing David to live might cause the loss of Jonathan's inherited right to the throne. If David has been equated with Sutpen up to this point, the analogy shifts momentarily to another generation, and the friendship between Henry Sutpen and Charles Bon becomes the equivalent of Jonathan and David's. In each case, there is a question as to who will succeed to power in the dynastic line. The analogy is such an appropriate one that Faulkner must have felt esthetically justified in shifting the biblical story somewhat, in order to suit the functional necessities of his own work about dynastic succession. At Saul's death, David became king, partly because of his prowess in war, which had made him very popular with the people. Sutpen at- tempts, through almost superhuman efforts of physical strength, to tear "violently a plantation" (p. 9) from the wilderness soil of Mississippi. A further analogy may lie in Sutpen's brutal fights in his barn with his Negro slaves; in a sense, the slaves are the enemies of the whites, as various people were enemies of the tribe of Israelites. Other white men come to watch Sutpen's fights with his Negroes; and though David's fights made him popular with the people, Sutpen's serve only as entertainment to the other whites and cause them to wonder at Sutpen's odd behavior. Sut- pen's apparent valor in fighting for the Southern cause during the Civil War is a further, and per- haps more logical, analogy, since it is his bravery in that war that ultimately wins some respect from the Southerners. While Saul was still alive, the enmity between him and David continued. At one point in his career, David went to live among the Philistines, traditional enemies of the Israelites, in the hope that Saul would not pursue him there. A somewhat tenuous parallel with Sutpen's career may lie in Sutpen's desertion of his own kind (the poor white class) and his going to make his way among the plantation owners. David, of course, never ac- tually allied himself with the Philistines and was always distrusted by them, as Sutpen was gen- erally distrusted by the Southern aristocrats. The fact that Israel lost one war with the Philistines, because of Saul's sins, may serve as a parallel to the loss of the Civil War by the South. David's song of grief at the deaths of Saul and Jonathan may very well be parodied in the eulo- gistic verse that Miss Rosa Coldfield is said to write about the dead Southern heroes; one can almost imagine Rosa writing: "The beauty of Mississippi is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!" David had several wives and a number of sons by them. The best known of these wives was, of course, Bathsheba, whom David acquired by the simple expedient of putting her husband in the forefront of a battle and ensuring that the husband would be killed. Sutpen, too, had several "wives" and children by them; the novel hints also that he may have obtained consent from Mr. Coldfield to marry Ellen through some questionable means, of which the reader is never told precisely. Nathan the prophet reproached David for his marriage with Bathsheba, telling him that the Lord was displeased and predicting correctly that their first son would die. However, another son, Solomon, was born to David and Bathsheba. There is some resemblance between these sons of David and those of Sutpen, Bon and Henry, though it is more logical to see resemblances be- tween Henry and Absalom than between Henry and Solomon. 30</page><page sequence="8">Ralph Behrens Among the most striking similarities between the two stories is that of the brother-sister tri- angles, represented on the one hand by Amnon, Absalom, and Tamar, and on the other by Charles Bon, Henry, and Judith. One of David's elder sons, Amnon, fell in love with his half-sister Tamar. He raped her and then refused to marry her. Tamar's brother Absalom hated Amnon for this deed and contrived to kill him. The parallel here is the obvious one of Bon as Amnon, Tamar as Judith, and Absalom as Henry.17 Absalom had asked David to avenge the rape of Tamar, but because of David's rather loose morals where women were concerned, he was irresolute about punishing Amnon; therefore, Absalom was forced to kill Amnon. Here again there is a parallel- Sutpen's almost inexplicable hesitancy to prevent the marriage of Judith and Bon other than sug- gesting that Henry must somehow stop the marriage. Perhaps Sutpen, like David, feels guilt about his sexual vagaries and realizes that he is in no moral position to impose the death penalty on one of his sons. Nevertheless, David was not dis- pleased with Absalom for killing Amnon, though officially he had to disapprove the murder; and Absalom was, therefore, sent into exile. The parallel between Absalom and Henry continues, since Henry voluntarily exiled himself from his father's house and renounced his right as heir to the house of Sutpen. Absalom returned from exile to organize a rebellion against David, and the long war which ensued weakened David's kingdom. David gave specific instructions that Absalom was not to be killed in the fighting, but during a battle Absalom's head was caught in the branches of a tree and he was killed by one of his father's men. David mourned the death of Absalom greatly. The parallel here to the Sutpen story lies in the rebellion of Henry against his father. Though Henry is not killed, as Absalom was, he is, for all practical purposes, dead to his father. The reader can imagine that Sutpen, if he ever mourned for anything, would have mourned the loss of his legitimate heir, because that loss amounts to a terrible blow to Sutpen's hope of establishing a dynasty. The father-son relationship, so impor- tant both to the Hebrews and to the plantation owners of the Old South, is brought to a tragic conclusion in both stories. The many parallels just examined were surely intended by Faulkner to be implicit in his novel, though he may not have intended the analogies to be as explicit as they have been made here. The general moral import of the David story is sum- marized in several passages of exegesis in The Interpreter's Bible; the comments are like those that Miss Rosa or Faulkner himself may have at times heard preachers expound upon passages from the books of Samuel. The Bible interpreter speaks of David's sins, particularly with Bath- sheba, as quite heinous, but grants that David's spiritual superiority is apparent in his acknowledg- ing his errors. David, according to the exegesis, "admits that the divine right of kings does not include the ruthless exploitation of his subjects and the flagrant denial of the will of God."'18 Sutpen never makes this admission. The inter- preter's comment on the story of Absalom is that "its lust, murder, and rebellion stem from David's own sin, both in its initial example and in its frustrating effect upon David's ability to discipline his own sons and to administer justice" (p. 1108). Sutpen is similarly frustrated. Each of the four methods of explaining the rea- son for the collapse of Sutpen's planned dynasty has its values. The theories based on innocence and hubris as the causes of downfall allow a rather narrow view of the tragedy because they concen- trate on the downfall of a single man. The theory that Sutpen's rise and fall constitute a micro- cosm of the social failures and errors of the Old South puts the story on a broader basis than the first two explanations and makes the applica- tion of greater significance, though the myth is still somewhat limited by regional and temporal analogy. To see the mythic import of the story in relation to the Old Testament, however, is to lend universal and timeless significance to Sutpen's story. The problem of the establishment of dynasties, of the moral injustices of kingship, is as old as the earliest civilizations. Strongly influenced by Hebraic-Christian traditions, Faulkner may have felt, at least with one part of his mind, that the collapse of the South (and of Sutpen's dynasty) was brought about by the moral shortcomings of the founders; but with another part of his mind he may have recalled the wry pessimism of the author of Ecclesiastes. The crux of the problem may, therefore, lie not so much in the inhumanity and immorality of dynasties as in the transitory nature of human accomplishments. Many empires 31</page><page sequence="9">The Thematic Center of Absalom, Absalom! have been established on the same principles as those which guided Sutpen, and those empires have fallen to new powers, no less antihumanistic, which survived for a time, but were again over- come by forces of greater strength.19 The succes- sion of dynasties recorded in the prophetic books of the Old Testament constitutes several cases in point: victories are temporary, all human en- deavors of a temporal nature are "vanities." Yet man still clings to the myth, exemplified in the Old Testament, that his accomplishments can trans- cend time, that he can build empires and perpetu- ate dynasties. Faulkner's comment at Nagano to the effect that people in the nineteenth century be- haved exactly like those "amazing people" in the Old Testament is an ironic recognition that men have not yet learned the lessons of the past. They still cling, as Sutpen did, to the myth of an ability to establish personal and permanent superi- ority. Sutpen's attempt and failure to found a dynasty exemplify anew the age-old vanity behind Notes 1 William Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom! (New York: Random, 1951), p. 8.

Walter Sullivan, in "The Tragic Design of Absalom, Absalom!" Soutlh Atlantic Quarterly, 50 (1951), 552-66, sees Faulkner's novel as meeting most of the requirements set up in Aristotle's definition of tragedy, though he draws no specific analogies to particular plays. John Lewis Longley, Jr., in Thle Tragic Mask: A Study of Faulkner's Heroes (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1963), pp. 206-18, notes characteristics not only of Greek tragedy but also of the epic in his discussion of Sutpen's story. 6 William J. Sowder, considering Sutpen in relation to existential philosophy, makes a point that is perhaps relevant to Sutpen's pride. Sowder sees Sutpen as exis- tentialist in making his free choice to break away from his the founding and failures of kingships in Old Testament literature. The American South was not unique in its antihumanism; its fall occurred, perhaps not simply because of its moral errors, but because of changing mores and superior opposing power. Indeed, Shreve, at the end of Absalom, Absalom!, predicts that "in time the Jim Bonds are going to conquer the western hemisphere" (p. 378). Nevertheless, the hubris, the innocence, the vanity, that led the Hebrew kings as well as American Southerners (and men like Sutpen) to believe that they could endure, still lead nations and men so to believe of themselves. William Faulkner is a latter- day historian and prophet using the traditional themes from the Old Testament, but he exemplifies those themes in the nineteenth-century American South.

But his failure, says Sowder, is a result of settling too definitely on that design, thereby losing freedom of choice and exhibiting mauLaise foi. Sutpen's refusal to modify his design, though called mauvaise foi by Sowder, may be the same thing that is more traditionally termed "pride."

Though Bon, like Absalom, is "beautiful," as Malin notes, surely the more logical conclusion is that the better parallel lies in equating Absalom with Henry, who indeed kills his older brother, as did Absalom. 18 The Interpreter's Bible, ed.
