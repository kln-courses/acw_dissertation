<plain_text><page sequence="1">A World for Us: the Case for Phenomenalistic Idealism. By John Foster. (Oxford UP, 2008. Pp. 261. Price £35.00.) One of the scandals of philosophy is the tyranny of fashion. Idealism, once so popular, is now largely ignored. Thank God, then, for those such as Foster who show us that far from being refuted, it can be argued for with at least as much cogency as other metaphysical theses which are taken much more seriously. Here John Foster builds on his 1982 book The Case for Idealism, presenting that case in a more accessible form, and reaching a slightly different conclusion. This new book is still quite hard work but well worth the effort. He clarifies his own position, which he calls canonical idealism, presents three arguments for it, and defends the objectivity of the external world in the context of his idealism. Canonical idealism is a species of phenomenalistic idealism, the thesis that the physical world is constituted by experiential facts. Canonical idealism further de- scribes these experiential facts as facts about the content of sensory experience. In addition, Foster argues that the physical world is objective because God ensures that human experience is suitably organized. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 741 Foster's first argument (ch. 1) is from the difficulty of giving an account of the perception of a supposedly mind-independent world. He examines what he calls the fimdamentalist and decompositional views. These are more familiar as the direct and the representational theories of perception, respectively. But, no doubt so as to avoid historical baggage, he defines these terms without assuming any understand- ing of traditional positions. His case is that neither view is satisfactory. Decomposi- tionalists may provide a single theory of the veridical and non-veridical cases, while fundamentalists seem driven to the disjunctive account. Although, as Foster con- cedes, veridical perception might be treated as quite different from hallucination, there are cases of distortion which are so slight that they cannot reasonably be treated any differently from the veridical case. The problem for the decomposition- alist view, although quite general, may be illustrated by assuming that we are said to perceive objects by being aware of sense-data which represent them. In that case we do not really perceive the objects, we just 'perceive' them; it is hard to understand how anything other than the fundamentalist (direct) theory could account for the phenomenology. The conclusion drawn from this dilemma is that the world we are aware of is not an external world but one made up of the content of experience (sense-data). As Foster would concede, this argument could be met by insisting that the phenomenology is fallible. I, for instance, hold that we perceive relations, not objects, but I acknowledge that fidelity to phenomenology provides a pnma facie case for idealism. The second argument (ch. 2) is based on the inscrutability of the intrinsic content of purely physical things: neither our direct experience nor our theorizing tells us anything about the intrinsic qualities of physical items (objects or the space they occupy). All we ever know are relations between the items. Nor, Foster adds, can we even conceive of what this intrinsic quality would be like. The idea seems to be that if only colours were intrinsic qualities, they would do the job well, with electrons being blue dots, protons pink ones, and so on. I am less impressed by this argument than by the previous one, having four objections: (i) we are aware of the intrinsic quality of regions of space, namely shapes, by moving our hands or other parts of our bodies to outline the region in question; (ii) even if we are not aware of the intrinsic qualities of physical objects, some other being (God maybe) could be; (iii) although I usually consider thisnesses otiose, if all else fails we might say that the only intrinsic non-relational qualities of objects are thisnesses; (iv) following John Anderson, we might hold that the know- able intrinsic properties of objects are structural, defined in terms of relations between their parts. To avoid positing unknowable intrinsic properties of simple objects, Anderson held that objects are infinitely complex. The argument to which Foster attaches most weight is the topic of ch. 3. It is based on the premise that the physical world would have to be empirically immanent: 'to be our world ... it has to be a world to which we have empirical access through our senses' (p. 138). Here Foster is not assuming infallible empirical access, just access which cannot be grossly in error. He then argues that realism about a mind- independent world entails the possibility of such gross errors as that, for instance, Oxford is in Cambridgeshire and Cambridge in Oxfordshire, but no human being © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 The Editors of The Philosophical (Quarterly</page><page sequence="3">742 BOOK REVIEWS could detect this because there are perverse laws of nature that make it seem that Oxford is in Oxfordshire and Cambridge in Cambridgeshire ('the Oxbridge swap'). His case for empirical immanence is that if, per impossible, there was an Oxbridge swap, then we would insist that the physical world was the world as it appears to us, and so there would be no swap. This is based upon a continuity argument: in the actual world the realist may maintain that the physical world is mind-independent, but by small degrees we could pass from the actual to the Oxbridge swap world, and eventually come to the case in which the physical world is a mind-dependent one. Foster assumes that there could be no such continuity, and he is surely right if the phrase 'the physical world' is a rigid designator, and if the supposed mind-independence of the physical world is an essential attribute. Realists may, however, treat the phrase 'the physical world' non-rigidly as applying to whatever is the physical world in the possible situation being considered. At opposite ends of the spectrum there are, according to the realist, how the world appears and how it is independently of the mind. The differ- ence between the ends of the spectrum is in the reference of the phrase 'the physical world', as used of various possible situations by someone in the actual world. At one end it refers to the mind-independent world, at the other to how the world appears. The realist may take this to be a vague phrase, and so the continuity argument collapses into a sorites. In the remainder of the book Foster defends his idealism from the objection that it is incompatible with the objective physical world that pre-existed human beings. Perhaps the most natural position for theists who are idealists is to submit that although the physical world is mind-dependent, one such mind is that of God ('panentheistic idealism'). As Foster notes, though, a corollary of the Oxbridge swap argument is the dependence of the physical world on human and similar minds. Therefore panentheistic idealism requires an anthropomorphic conception of the divine mind. Presumably this is why he rejects it. Foster's rejection of panentheistic idealism has the unfortunate consequence that the physical world cannot predate the first occurrence of human (or similar) minds. He handles this by resort to a distinction between the mundane and transcendental frameworks (p. 186). I interpret this in the light of ch. 16 of The Case for Idealism. We may distinguish the temporally ordered sequence of mental states, some before, some after others, from the t co-ordinate of space-time, and treat the latter as Foster treats space, namely, as dependent on the experience of humans. Then just as space extends beyond the farthest that human beings have gone, this t dimension could extend back into the past beyond human history. There remains the problem of reconciling objectivity with the dependence of the physical world on human minds. Part of Foster's answer is that the physical world does not depend on the human mind alone but on whatever restricts the range of experiences we have. This cannot be the whole of the answer, because human be- ings lost in virtual reality, as in The Matrix, would meet that condition. What extra is required? Foster suggests a normative constraint, namely, that the restrictions are such that we ought to think in terms of a physical world; he then attributes the source of this normative constraint to God. I am not convinced. Instead, I would consider © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 The Editors of The Phibsophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 743 the objectivity to derive from the way space (or space-time) has a necessary geometric structure. God is part of the explanation only if this necessity is divinely ordained, in which case it is nomological rather than metaphysical. Suppose for the sake of argument that the objectivity of the physical world does derive from a normative constraint, as Foster suggests. He leaves it open whether God acts directly to bring about our experiences, or indirectly by means of laws of nature. I do not think he should be so open-minded on the issue. For there are three or four considerations which should make us prefer the hypothesis that God acts indirectly by means of laws which restrict our sensations: (a) even if the objectivity of the physical world derives from a normative constraint, we retain the intuition that pace Hume, the natural order is necessary in some sense; (b) some of our sensations are under our own control, and it is easier to reconcile this with God's power by thinking of God as setting in place restrictions rather than as God's causing us to have various sensations - for in the latter case, something else is required to explain the limits on our capacity to produce (vivid) sensations; (c) related to this is the threat of occasionalism: by bringing about our sensations God becomes the author of all our 'deeds', not we; (d) if the order in our sensations relies upon God's bringing them about, we can construct continuity arguments similar to the Oxbridge swap argument. As part of our education, God might have arranged for us to have slightly mismatching experiences. In addition God might ensure a liberal sprinkling of zombies, so that only the elect have sensations. At some stage we have passed from Berkeley's God to Descartes' demon. If the Oxbridge swap argument threatens real- ism about a mind-independent world, why does not this argument threaten the objectivity of the physical world? I conclude, then, that if the Oxbridge swap argument succeeds, there is a com- pelling case for law-governed canonical idealism, though it does not follow that there is any case for theism in addition to the familiar one that the character of the laws (in this case, the way they favour social interaction as well as the beauty of the physical world) may be explained in terms of divine providence. So I not only commend this fine book to readers but also commend to them a rigorous examina- tion of the Oxbridge swap argument. Does it work?
