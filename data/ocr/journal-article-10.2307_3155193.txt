<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL NOTES A RECENT CHAPTER IN THE MODERNIST CONTROVERSY THE HISTORY OF THE WAHRMUND INCIDENT Professor Dr. Ludwig Wahrmund is a learned German Austrian who for years has filled, to the eminent satisfaction of the Austro-Hungarian university authorities, and of ecclesiastical scholars everywhere, the chair of ecclesiastical law in the juridical faculty of Innsbruck. He has been a loyal and devoted Roman Catholic also, but with enough red German blood in his veins to constrain him to feel that in remaining a churchman he neither was degraded to the position of a slave, nor compelled to abandon that instinct for thought, free-speech, and free action, which is character- istic of the better representatives of the Teuton race. This brought him, somewhere about I902, into conflict with ultramontane Catholicism, at which time he was the head of one of the Roman Catholic associations known as the "Leo Society," of which the aim was the fostering of "Catho- lic" science (sic). Though sorely perturbed in mind his conclusion then was to hold fast to Roman Catholicism: "The great Catholic church," said he, "is really not so bad and reactionary as one might believe from its enunciations" (in connection with the celebration of the five hundredth anniversary of the emission of the bull "Unam Sanctam" in Brixen). "The free-from-Rome movement is actually an act of desperation. There is no necessity yet to despair of the Catholic church." ... In 1900oo it looked in Austria as if the freedom-loving German element would obtain a complete victory in the empire. Two years before the party of Schtnerer and Wolf had unfurled the banner "free-from-Rome." In the elections victory after victory was won. Dazed and divided among themselves the clericals stood crying for aid from the state-the picture of helplessness. Then, like a stroke of lightning from Heaven, came the controversy between Schinerer and Wolf which upset everything. That was the salvation of clericalism in Austria. From Germany the clerical party obtained the organizers of their army; while, goaded by the partisans of Rome, the state hunted and mercilessly oppressed the German evangelical pastors. Rhenish, Westphalian, Bavarian chaplains and monks were in the clerical battalions. Bonifacius-Catholic, and Pius- Catholic university associations, Christian-social party organizations, and a hundred other militant bodies were formed and took commanding posi- tions. That which for nine years had not been possible on account of the 238</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL NOTES 239 freedom-aspirations of the people came to pass on November 18-21, 1905, in Vienna--a general Austrian Catholic Convention. Imposing, noisy, challenging its opponents, it showed that the time of arming was over and that of action had come. "Our patience is exhausted" was the cry. Burgermeister Lueger of Vienna delivered an inflammatory address, as did many others, including Benedictines and lay-Catholics from Germany. "The overthrow of free research" was one of their mot- toes. "The conquest of the university" was another. Lueger said, "The entire instruction in the empire from the foundation to the summit should be in the hands of the modest, indigent members of the orders [the monks] .... and we should recapture the University of Vienna." In answer to these war cries Professor Wahrmund delivered a popular lecture on January 18, 190o8, against the suppression of free scientific research of which some of the more important parts are given below. It created great excitement in the Roman Catholic church. The papal nuncio at Vienna, Prince Granito di Belmonte, appealed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the suppression of this printed lecture, which he characterized as "the most repugnant book that ever was written (das verwerflichste Buch das je geschrieben)." He also demanded the dismissal of Wahr- mund from his office. The Austrian Government suppressed the book, but found it hard to obey the mandate of a foreign ambassador, while retaining the respect of its subjects, and sought to appease the natural wounding of Austrian pride by the semi-official statement that "the nuncio had not made a specific demand for Wahrmund's removal," etc. But alas! the inconsiderate prince declared publicly in several newspapers (Alldeutsches Tageblatt, March 20, 1908): It stands to reason that it is impossible for Wahrmund in the future to lecture on ecclesiastical law since the first condition is that he be a Catholic .... By his blasphemies of God he has shut himself out of church communion .... I have therefore made a demand of the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Baron Aehren- thal), and the Minister of Religion and Instruction that Professor Wahrmund be removed from his chair. The Academic Senate of the University of Vienna declared that by the decrees of April iI, 1872, the lay faculties were absolutely withdrawn from any ecclesiastical or confessional influence; . . . . that "the duty of teach- ing ecclesiastical law in the juridical faculty is in no way connected with the convictions of the teacher, but only with the matter, and not in the treat- ment of the relations of this matter to the church." The Minister of Instruction, Marchet, said in his report on the budget.</page><page sequence="3">240 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY "The Innsbruck professor has only made use of his individual rights of free research, and therefore the subjection of these to rules cannot be admit- ted to discussion." So that in spite of the clerical protests, the German Centrum press, and the Bavarian bishops, the demands of his enemies were denied by state and university; yet influence enough was brought to bear on the faculty of law and the science of government in Innsbruck, April 21, 1908, to cause it to declare that the ecclesiastical-law lectures of Professor Wahrmund in the coming summer semester would be entirely omitted. (On the other hand, in the session of the Professors' College of May 15, it was decided that Professor Wahrmund was free to conduct the one-hour exercises in ecclesiastical law during the summer semester of 1908, which had been announced.) To mitigate the evil consequences of the loss of all instruction in ecclesiastical law at Innsbruck, the govern- ment saw itself compelled to enlarge the prohibitive order so as to include instruction in all the juristic faculties in Innsbruck, and to empower the examining board to pass over the imperfections of the students at this test. But here the freedom-loving part of the student body rose in ever increasing numbers, declaring it a shame and a danger to the university. A general strike was called for May 14 if no satisfactory result had been previously reached. Then the Academic Senate of the University of Vienna issued an appeal to the students, promising them that it and the faculties would stand against the domination of a foreign state. The Catholic students of Innsbruck, in their many corps and clubs, assembled on May 21 in the University before 7:oo00 A. M. Shortly after 8:oo00 his Magnificence, the Rector v. Skala, appeared and commanded all who had not courses to attend to leave the building. In ten minutes he would have the great doors closed. Loud cries of "Oh," and hisses greeted this threat. The "freedom" students were prevented from entering by the Catholics. Then the Rector announced on the blackboard that until further notice all lectures would cease. The rebellious students, after exacting a promise from him that during that day the doors should be closed, departed singing the "Kaiserlied." The university was opened the next day. On May 31 Professor Wahrmund's leave of absence expired. The student body was determined to insist upon the fulfilment of the compromise of May 14, 1908, under all circumstances. The representa- tives of the national student body adopted a resolution at the Craz Hoch- schule Convention to proceed with the sharpest weapons in case Wahrmund should be prevented from lecturing in the summer semester. On June I he called together his class on ecclesiastical law in the seminar for the first time.</page><page sequence="4">CRITICAL NOTES 241 A meeting of Innsbruck professors passed the three following resolutions: I. Professor Wahrmund is assured of our appreciation of the fact that from collegiate reasons he abstained from opposing the suppression of his course on ecclesiastical law. 2. It will be understood that Professor Wahrmund will announce his special course. 3. It is assured that the ecclesiastical-law seminar, and with that the teaching- activity of Professor Wahrmund, has begun without disturbance. In the afternoon, between 3:00 and 4:00, he held a one-hour seminar before about 35 students. On June 2, 190o8, Freiherr v. Spiegelfeld, Statthalter of Tyrol, at the instigation of the President of Ministers (owing to the fact that the Minister of Instruction could not be reached) ordered the University of Innsbruck closed on the ground that, owing to the resumption of his functions by Professor Wahrmund, grave disturbances were to be feared. This "gross violation of the terms of the compromise," as the students called it, was the signal for the general uprising of all students of the Austrian institutes for instruction-universities, technical schools, mining academies, agricul- tural colleges, evangelic-theological faculties, academies for the cultivation of the arts, commercial schools, and veterinary schools, without regard to nationality. Germans, Tschechs, Ruthenians, Poles, Italians, Slavs, etc., it was said to the number of 30,000, joined in the movement. Nearly the entire machinery for instruction in Austria stood still on June 3. The demands of the "freedom" students were the following: First, the government must officially recognize Professor Wahrmund's eccle- siastical-law seminar. Further, it must permit the announcement of the marriage- law lectures by Wahrmund (in the summer semester, 1908). Finally, we demand that the unimpeded teaching-activity of Wahrmund for the winter semester of 1908 shall be guaranteed. The question was how to render the students defenseless. The diplo- mats proposed the closing of the summer semesters in all the high schools without prejudice to the students, and the abandonment of the judicial proceedings which had been instituted against Wahrmund. The Minister of Instruction called the directors of all the Hochschulen to Vienna. They unanimously adopted a resolution that whereas the Minister of Instruction had declared in favor of the absolute freedom of instruction and freedom of research there was no longer any reason for the students to persist in this strike. Coincidently it was published that Professor Wahrmund had been assured by the Minister of Religion that the resumption of his teaching- activity in the following semester was absolutely assured.</page><page sequence="5">242 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY This and numerous other official appeals from the government and from the universities did not satisfy the students, who demonstrated in Vienna against the Ministry and even the Parliament, demanding to be heard. They tore down the announcement of the Rector and trod it under foot, but were finally persuaded to retire, which they did, singing "Gaudea- mus igitur." The "freedom" students of Innsbruck issued another pro- nunciamento in which they declared that "the highest duty of the Academic Senate was to see to it that the unquestioned rights of Professor Wahrmund are not touched from any side," etc. Ministers, academic councils, vitu- perative clerical press organs, and student bodies were keeping up a bedlam throughout the empire without the prospect of peace, when finally Profes- sor Wahrmund, the innocent cause of all the trouble, himself came forward with a personal appeal to the students on June 20. In this he tells them that after his personal audiences with the highest authorities in Vienna he is convinced that his teaching-activity in the coming winter semester will be guaranteed. As to the summer semester it is too late to settle the controversy during the short remaining period of its duration. The reason for the strike is therefore eliminated. The strike has had the effect of warding off all attacks on the freedom of the Hochschulen. He thanks them warmly for espousing his cause and begs them to discontinue the strike. His words effected what the ministries and senates could not accomplish. The strike was called off, and on June 22 the lectures and courses of instruc- tion recommenced.' What the ultimate results of the Wahrmund incident may be, no one now can foresee. The chances are that the present excitement will dissolve gradually, like a cloud of vapor in a water-saturated atmosphere. It is but one of a long series of events constituting symptoms of the state of public opinion, each event producing similar excitement which has been gradually dissipated, but each time more slowly. The fact is, the dewpoint of the atmosphere of public opinion is rising; or in other words its capacity to absorb and forget these events is becoming less and less, and finally the inevitable conflict between the Fictionists and Veritists will be fought out. The Austrian Minister of Public Instruction transferred Professor Wahrmund to Prague, and this partly averted the danger of the situation but may not have ended it entirely. Meantime a new report spread that Pro- fessor Wahrmund would receive a leave of absence for one year which he SThe foregoing account of the events which led to the present crisis are mainly taken from P.

In point of fact Professor Wahrmund has been delivering his usual course of lectures on ecclesiastical law at the German University of Prague without any interruption since its opening in October, I908, and the pro- tests and disturbances threatened by the clerical party have been conspicu- ously absent. This fact is generally regarded by the liberal party as a victory for the cause he represents. A LETTER FROM DR. WAHRMUND Dr. Persifor Frazer, Philadelphia: HIGHLY HONORED SIR: I gather from your kind communications that the battles between the old and new conceptions of the universe which are in great measure moving Europe today find an echo also on the other side of the ocean, and that especially you have not shirked the trouble of informing the American public of the events which in the past year were connected with my name. While tendering you, therefor, my particular thanks, I would not on this occa- sion omit to give expression to the feelings of the warmest sympathy which I, in common with so many other representatives of the intellectual enlightenment in Europe, feel for the United States, which has long ago succeeded in separating Church from State, without on that account having separated Society from Religion; and in which all cultured people give evidence, to a far greater degree than on the European continent, of their living interest in the great spiritual problems which at all times have been the points of support of real progress in culture. Accept, most honored sir, the assurance of the sincere high esteem with which I have the honor to be Your very obedient LUDWIG WAHRMUND EXCERPTS FROM WAHRMUND'S ADDRESS The address is entitled, "Catholic View of the Universe and Free Science (Katholische Weltanschauung and freie Wissenschaft)--A Popular Science Lecture with Consideration of the Syllabus of Pius X and of the Encyclical 'Pascendi Dominici Gregis,'" by Ludwig Wahrmund, Pro- fessor of Ecclesiastical Law at Innsbruck. Professor Wahrmund commences by observing that the assertion not long since formulated that we were in the decisive stage of the battle between two hostile views of the universe is now strictly true, and yet the attention they merit is not bestowed upon the events which are transpiring. From a pamphlet of the Catholic University Association several quotations are made and amongst others this: At the universities we find mostly unbelieving Protestant, Jewish, or reli- giously indifferent professors; at the universities, in the name of science, God,</page><page sequence="7">244 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY eternity, Christ, immortality, etc., are often openly denied; at the universities the students who are to be future professors are suffering shipwrecks of faith; at the universities the hate to the Catholic church, and especially the "free-from-Rome" movement is fostered; at the universities the free-thought efforts to set aside religious instruction, religious exercises, to promote separation of church and state, dissolution of marriage, and cremation of corpses find their fruitful soils; from the universities the most incredible, misleading writings go in quantities to the people, etc. The lecture continues in the following vein: Is the Catholic church threatened by the discoveries of modern science? Why so ? Are religion and science opposites whose strife will only cease with the annihilation of one or the other? The answer has been given in different ways since the earliest times. In the eighteenth century the death of religion was predicted. In the nineteenth the bankruptcy of science was announced with evident joy by the Catholic church .... We are unquestionably ignorant of the essence of force and matter but that we should for that reason believe in gods who personally come from heaven, or men who personally go there, no rational man will maintain. We cannot explain consciousness, but nevertheless it is clear that almighty power and human limita- tion cannot exist in one person. We do not know what gives the last impulse to life in the foetus, but we are sure that virgins do not bear children .... The war between religion and science is to be carefully differentiated from the war between the Catholic religion and the science of today. Religion in itself, as a merely intelligible entity, comes in certain historical forms to view. It is an ideal value, its form a passing mould. The spirit may be assumed as given from the beginning, the form is man's work in all cases, and, as such, subject to the change of the times. Religion flourishes in inmost relation with just and ethical views, with spiritual knowledge and learning, in short with the entire culture of a given period. If it do not possess the power to adapt itself to the culture of late generations it must perish. The Catholic church boasts that it is the only religion, but the science of religion disregards this claim and relegates not only Catholicism but also Christianity, on which it rests, to merely one historical form of the reli- gious idea, one of the many positive forms which mankind has experienced and will in future experience. From this it follows that Catholicism as well as Christianity may be destroyed by modern science without proving anything as to the great question of the relation between the religious and scientific views of the universe .... Catholicism is, as we all know, an historically developed form of Christianity. It borrowed distinct elements from the original Christianity and independently built them up farther; it has passed, in the course of centuries, through a whole series of phases of development to terminate in today's ultramontane Catholicism. Although many Catholics do not support this phase it must be regarded as the</page><page sequence="8">CRITICAL NOTES 245 official form approved by the Pope, and we are compelled to accept it as the type all the more because we are considering practical Catholicism and not theological theories. As in all more highly developed religious systems we must distinguish four principal components, viz.: the God-idea, the universe-picture, the cult, and morality. From these component parts is to be distinguished the external organization or the constitution of those societies which we call churches. It will not be denied that the God-idea of Christianity was borrowed from the Jews to whom it was monotheistic, anthropomorphic, and national. But in the first century of its existence Christianity changed this one God into a triune God. We are not concerned with the theological contests by means of which this was decided, nor with the dogma that three different persons constitute one God which the Roman Catholic catechism declares to be an inconceivable secret. It is important however to note that with the elevation of Jesus (the human being who, according to the evangelical account, lived and moved in the historical epoch) to a second God-personality the way was open to people heaven with a whole Olympus of deities. Besides this, in its march of conquest around the world, Christianity met the temples of many heathen gods dear to the hearts of the various tribes and people. To exterminate them was not possible. He who would win must accommodate himself to circumstances. The heathen god became a Christian saint and the old feast-days were perpetuated under Christian names. Giving God the place of an earthly king the step was easy to surround him with a court which in the oldest religions consisted of demi-gods intermediary between Heaven and Earth. Consequently about the fifth century after Christ we find his mother, Mary, assume the r6le of Queen of Heaven introducing the female element into the Christian God-idea." Further we find the apostles of Christ grouped about God; the prophets of the old and new dispensation, the undefined line of saints, and the legions of angels. I say undefined because according to the Catholic view, as is well known, the head of the church has the right to present at all times new saints for the unrefusable approval of God . In order to give the exact sense of the church doctrine it must be distinctly understood that Mary, the angels, and saints are not to be conceived of as actual gods. The second general Council of Nice (787 A.D.) declared that god-worship belongs only to the triune God, and the picture of Christ, the Virgin, the angels, and the saints are only to be honored by kissing, genuflexion, lighting of candles, and burning of incense. But in every religion theology and religious life must P The growth of the present worship of Mary is well known and often cited. Com- pare for example the following theological view of G. Freund in The Honoring of Mary: "Mary had the free use of the understanding before she saw the light of the world in the womb of her mother Anna. We may assume that while yet unborn she knew much more of God and of the hereafter than the greatest minds after years of thinking, studying, and praying."</page><page sequence="9">246 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY be distinguished, and not the first but the latter gives the practical value. In this sense it may be asserted that Catholicism is only theoretically to be called monotheistic. In its practical workings and in the popular conception it, in a way, reverences polytheism borrowed from the heathenism once so bitterly opposed .... But for another weighty reason Catholicism cannot be called a monotheistic religion, viz: the Devil. Scientifically speaking the Devil is a representative of the old dualistic system of religion, which supposes the government of the world to be in the hands, not of one deity, but of two, representing the principles of good and evil and in perpetual conflict with each other. We meet the Devil in the old Iranian religion of the Persians formulated by Zoroaster. The Jews made the acquaintance of the Devil in Babylon, and from the second century before Christ he makes his appearance in Jewish literature. From the Jews Christianity took him, and especially by the Catholic church has he been tended with such a loving care that in spite of all enmities of unbelief he enjoys today theibest of health. Of course he is not alone. He has an army of demons and evil spirits in command "of whom," says the Roman simple catechism, "the head is Lucifer or Satan." Father Aurelian, of the Wemdinger Capucine cloister, has recently recorded, with the authorization of the Bishop of Augsburg and Eich- stitt, how on July 13 and 14, 1891, he with his own hand drove the Devil out of a boy who was possessed, and added this minute to the archives of the cloister on August 15, I89I. Aurelian declares in his report "whosoever denies in our day 'possession,' acknowledges thereby that he has strayed from the teaching of the Catholic church." How this doctrine of the power of the Devil over men, and, above all, his notorious dominion in the world, can be reconciled with monotheism, and with the almighty power of a good and just God is a question which scholastics but not human reason may explain .... As to the second of the elementary bases of the God-concept, the God of Christianity has always had a human form, for Christ refers in the Evangelist to the old Mosaic saying that God created man in his own image. This gross conception of God is so abused by modern Catholics as to remind one of the Roman author Celsus' (178 A.D.) question, how man can dare to invest God with the character and actions of an irritable man who is always ready with abusive words and threats. This God suspiciously resembles the clerical Philistine who dances blindly to the piping of his priest. "God hates modernists," "God desires Catholic Universities," "God demands an accounting for an anti- Catholic vote," "God is enraged at the tone of the liberal newspapers." In a word, God works in politics like a candidate for the Reichsrath and storms against throwing light on the subject like a rustic hostler; and what is most important, he does all this exactlylin accordance with the views of the ultramontane clergy .... Herewith we come to the third element of the Christian Catholic God-concept. The Jehovah of the Old Testament was a national God who gave priority to his people in return for their exclusive worship of himself. He was a severe, jealous, terrible God, exacting fear. Whereas Christ represented God as a good and just</page><page sequence="10">CRITICAL NOTES 247 Father whose care and mercy extended over the entire human race. Love of God replaced fear of God. The original Christian church taught this, but the later Christian church held to this idea only theoretically. In practice it reverted to the old conditions, but instead of a national God substituted a Christian God who with the mercilessness of the old Jehovah damned through eternity all those who did not enter the church of Christ. It is sufficient to refer to the bull "Unam Sanctam" (1302) to show that Catholicism required complete subjection to the bishop of Rome as an indispensable condition of salvation. It is significant that this bull failed of recognition in France so that the Catholic assumptions of that day were different on the two sides of the French frontier..... As did the old Jewish so also did the Christian-Catholic God make a covenant with his chosen people (which have long been the clergy of the Roman church). The clergy alone through the teaching of the Holy Ghost is called to the church army. The laity is subject to it, as the sheep to its shepherd; and, as sheep are stupid beasts, no part of the direction can fall to their lot, said the Jesuit, Lainez, at the Council of Trent in the sixteenth century. The covenant is between God and the clergy, and includes very different concessions from those granted by the Old Testament Jehovah. The cardinal and prince-archbishop of Salzburg says, February 2, 19o05, "Honor the priest for both of the high powers with which he is invested." One of these is "the power to forgive sins .... God has, as it were, abdicated his omnipotence for this purpose, for the time being, in favor of his representative on earth, the fully empowered priest .... Where in the whole world is a power like this ?" He even denies that such a power exists in Heaven: "When you look around at the army of patriarchs and prophets, martyrs and blood sacrifices, holy virgins, angels, archangels, and the throne and powers- can they pardon you your sins ? No! .... Even Mary, the mother of God, the queen of Heaven, cannot do it ..... Oh! inconceivably high power! Heaven permits itself to be governed by the earth in the form and manner of judging. The vassal is judge on earth and in heaven the judgment which he makes is con- firmed by the Lord." Of course this applies only to Catholic priests. The Protestant pastors do not possess the priestly consecration by which this great power is transmitted in accordance with the dispensation of Christ. But, if pos- sible, the second power of the priest is greater and loftier than this, namely, that of consecrating, i. e., transforming bread and wine into the real body and the real blood of Christ; naturally the Protestant pastor is excluded here also. "Christ, the only begotten son of God the Father, by whom heaven and earth were created, and who bears the whole universe, is hereby at the command of the Catholic priest .... Christ has given authority to the Catholic priest over himself, his body, his flesh and blood, his godhead and his human existence, and obeys the priest."3 3 That the Salzburg archbishop is not alone in the above absolute Catholic views is proven amongst other things by an article entitled "Chi i il prete ?" which appeared in Como (Tipografia della Divina Providenza) in I907. Under the caption "The priest is the man of miracles," it says: "What reverend men have had the power to call God from heaven to earth, and that too at any time they please ? Now the priest</page><page sequence="11">248 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY With Edward von Hartmann4 we must acknowledge that with the knowledge of today this kind of God-concept has become impossible .... As the golden key to the understanding of the history of creation we have, as is known, the books of Moses inspired by a divine revelation. According to these the earth is a flat plain surrounded by the sea over which is the fixed vault of heaven with the illuminating bodies for day and night, and under it purgatory and hell. God made all this in a few days out of nothing about six thousand years ago, of which four thousand elapsed before, and two thousand after, the birth of Christ. All human beings are descended from Adam and Eve, the first having been made by God out of clay, and then furnished a rib to produce his partner. Scientific study showed long ago that this account is merely a somewhat imperfect reproduction of older creation myths, but the Catholic church teaches it literally today; spreads it abroad in thousands of catechisms and insists that it be accepted as part of the religious instruction of all schools, and as a revealed truth. Colum- bus was denounced as a heretic for maintaining that the earth was spherical; Copernicus and Galileo were bitterly persecuted for proving that the earth revolved and not the heavens. Not till the nineteenth century would the Catholic church admit, and then only tacitly, what all the world knew long before. Today she fights with the same fanaticism against the theory of evolution, of which the funda- mental thoughts are rooted in the very being of every educated man. Instead of Copernicus and Galileo she hales to the heretic stocks Lamarck, Darwin, Haeckel, and others . Dr. Joseph Bantz, professor of theology in the Royal Academy of Miinster in 1905, concluded from theological and profane scientific reasons that hell is situated in the interior of our planet, and that the volcanoes are its chimneys. Another savant, Franz Xavier Schouppe, S. J., in his work, The Doctrine of Purgatory, Illustrated by Facts and Private Revelation (1899), actually rises to a calculation of the time which an average Christian must pass in purgatory. He reaches his conclusion thus: "Let us assume ten as an average estimate of the number of daily sins. On the basis of 365 days this gives 3,650 sins committed per year. To facilitate the calculation let us put this at 3,000. In ten years this would amount to 30,000, and in twenty to 60,000ooo sins. Let us assume that during the lifetime of the sinner half of these sins are wiped out by prayer and good works; there remains a debt of 30,000 sins, (for twenty years). Let us proceed with the calculation. When one dies after twenty years of a virtuous life how much time will the expiation require ? Let us assume that every sin demands one hour of purgatory. (This is a very small amount if we judge by the revelations of the saints.) Let us then assume one hour of purgatory for every sin, then the total length of time which does this at mass. He speaks a few mysterious words, and God, obedient to their words, descends regularly to the altar into the hands of the priest and subject to his disposition. So that the priest handles God." 4 The Christianity of the New Testament, 2d ed., p. 303.</page><page sequence="12">CRITICAL NOTES 249 30,000 hours would entail would be three years, three months and fifteen days," etc.s According to the Catholic view, God, who made the laws of Nature, breaks or interrupts their efficiency at any time capriciously, so that a necessary chain of cause and effect is unthinkable. There can be causes without effects and effects without causes .... The superfluous arms, legs, and heads of the most popular saints (all officially certified by the church) are countless. From the unsewn coat at Trier, the super- holy prepuce of Christ, the Grotto of Lourdes, down to Ignatius water or the little images of Mary which (according to a recent curial decision), moistened with water and swallowed, elicit the protection of the mother of God, there seems nothing which pious fraud has not dared, and credulous simplicity has not accepted. But it would not be worth while to spend time on the subject of the gross superstitions of the church were it not for the complete paganizing of the Catholi- cism of the people, and the misuse of religion not only to worldly but to unlawful and immoral purposes. Should one attempt to account for these extravagances on the plea of unavoidable misuse of things good in themselves, it may be answered that the plea of misuse cannot apply to the fact that the present ages, through the guidance of the Order of the Jesuits, has gone far beyond the Middle Ages in paganizing the Catholic worship. At the end of the seventeenth century this order introduced the cult of the heart of Jesus, never till then practiced, and which at first Rome repudiated on the ground that with the same reason the eyes, tongue, or other members of Jesus might be made subjects of adoration.6 . The celebrated bishop Bonomelli, of Cremona, remarked in his pamphlet, called Autumn Leaves, that the people ask of the saints mainly material things and often those forbidden and contrary to religious principles. A German paper replies that this only takes place in Italy: but that in fact it occurs also in Germany is proved by the monthly publication edited by a Catholic priest in Paderhorn with ecclesiastical approbation, and called The Messenger of the Holy Anthony of Padua. In the February number of 190o6 this saint is besought for a "good and agreeable tenant for a lodging," "for the recovery of a debt," and even "for a relation with a certain gentleman right soon." Let us glance at the Christian Catholic morals. The Jewish law was a complex of numerous formal regulations which all inust be fulfilled. They were of religious, moral, and legal nature. A "righteous s According to a contribution from conservative circles published in the Vienna Deutsches Volksblatt, January 4, 1908, a well-known professor of theology and prelate deserves to be ranged with Messrs. Bantz and Schouppe. This gentleman defends the burning of heretics, considers earthquakes the anger of Satan, denies the revolution of the earth around the sun, repudiates the validity of the conclusion drawn from Foucault's pendulum experiments, and maintains the creation of the earth in six days, etc. 6 Bahmer-Romundt, The Jesuits, p. I36.</page><page sequence="13">250 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY man" was according to them a religious, moral, and legally blameless man. Thus according to the Talmud doctrine the motive of righteousness remains something mechanically superficiaPl7 because it did not depend on the ethical motives but on the result of the psychological process, and because the control of the act and of the desire produced the theory of reward. He who over- came the lust he felt for his neighbor's wife was, according to the Talmud, righteous. And the piety of the Pharisees which ruled the lower classes was superficial and formal. Therefore Christ likened them to whitened sepulchers and said, "For I say unto you except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 5:20). Here opens a singular contradiction in Christian morality. Christ brought all law back to love of God and your fellow-man. Is such love an isolated act ? No, it is a permanent condition, which stands in the closest relation with the inner disposition of the man. Is true, genuine love ever produced and directed by hope of reward or fear of punishment ? Love is unselfish. Just in the example of love we recognize with especial clearness the necessity that the disposition which comes into consideration in morality must be inwardly truly developed and out- wardly freely put into execution .... Never can thinking and acting under given conditions of compulsion be called moral. I am moral when I do good because I recognize it as good and for no other reason. If I do it on account of reward or punishment I become a selfish speculator. Selfishness is immoral. So taught the philosophers long before Christ, and also original Christianity. The immortal service of the apostle Paul was the inculcation of the principle of freedom of conscience and his protest against the authority of ritual. "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage" (Gal. 5:1). The morals of the Catholic church are about as follows: God is in principle the highest lord and governor of the world, but in fact the Devil governs on earth, and through him sin, to which mankind has been subjected since the fall of Eve. God has given to man freedom of will but the Devil diverts it to evil. One must therefore regard human nature pessimistically and overcome its tendency to evil by a closed fence of commands and interdictions. But even with this man could not succeed in reaching heaven if God's mercy had not furnished him with helps. These commands and mercies the Catholic church alone offers to man. In order to be a good Christian one must believe in God, know the paternoster, fulfil the commands of God and the church, and receive the sacraments .... Both sin and punishment are carefully systematized. Sins are divided between hereditary sin and personal sins; the latter into deadly and pardonable sins. There are some capital crimes, six sins against the Holy Ghost, four sins that cry to heaven, etc. On the other hand there are seven supernatural virtues, three 7 Hartmann, The Christianity of the New Testament.</page><page sequence="14">CRITICAL NOTES 251 godly virtues, four cardinal virtues, seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, and eight evangelical felicities. The punishment system is likewise comprehensive. There are punishments here and beyond. Here they are divided into medicinal and vindictive. Beyond, they are purgatory and hell. The church determines both classes; and those of the beyond must be carried out because God has given the church the right to bind and loose. By reason of this power to loose, the church gives three methods of avoiding the punishment for sin: First, those means which are contained in the gift of grace of the church. Here belong the pardon of the confessional and absolution. Second, a means of facilitating the forgiveness of sins and atonement. Here belong prayer, fasting, and the giving of alms. Third, means which can be found and used only by a wise estimate of the sinner with the help of Catholic moral theology. Here belong casuistry and the application of probabilities. In other words in practical life there occur many cases where it is not at once clear what is virtue and what is sin, what is allowed and what is forbidden. In such cases the church permits the believer to choose the construction which is most favorable to him, provided he furnish plausible grounds, especially the opinion of some recognized theologian. The principle of probabilities (" the prince of moral theology") has been formulated by St. Alphonso de Liguori, who says among other things: "Let him who will progress in God's path submit himself to a learned confessor and obey him as if God. Whoso does this needs not to account to God for his acts." ... . This doctrine reduces the freedom of will to zero but also disturbs the innate principle of truth which belongs to all morality, by permitting ambiguous speech and mental reservation. Thus the adulteress can swear that she has not broken her marriage vows-adding in thought "since the last time." The Catholic church in the realm of morality places form and surface above substance and content; and faith above love. And perhaps the countless errors which consti- tute her divergence from the first Christianity can be summed up in this principle for "Love blesses and Faith curses" says Luther. However much human imper- fection is shown in the teachings of the evangels, the heart-warming sun of love streams over all shadows. And what has become of this love in Catholicism ? I will not here repeat the oft-told stories of force, compulsion, index and inquisition, heretic and witch persecution, nor the endless list of martyrs which the church has tortured and burned, and sent robbed and dishonored into the grave. I will answer that question by a single example, by the curse which the French Pope Clement VI (1346) hurled, during his political war with the German empire, at Louis the Bavarian: "In order that the said Louis acknowledge that he has fallen into these penalties and into the wrath of God, and into our disfavor, we beseech the might of God to bring to nothingness his fury, to bring low and extinguish his pride, to overthrow him by the strength of its rights, to deliver him into the 8 Theologia moralis, I, I, n.

May a pitfall be laid for him which he does not see and may he fall into it. Cursed be his entering and his departing! God strike him with madness, blindness, and insanity! May heaven hurl its lightnings upon him! May the wrath of God and of the holy apostles, Peter and Paul, whose church he would and does disturb, burn against him in this world and in the next! May the whole world fight against him! May the earth open and engulf him alive! In one generation may his name be wiped out, and his memory disappear from the earth! May all the elements be against him! May his dwelling be desert! May the works of all the departed saints confuse him and show him even in this world the retribution which is over him! May his sons be thrown out of their houses and be delivered before his eyes into the hands of enemies who shall annihilate them."9 Let us again take a retrospective view. A God-concept declared by dogma to be inexplicable and in the eyes of the modern world impossible; a long anti- quated contemptuous denial of all the scientific discoveries of modern times as the world-concept; a largely superstitious, heathen, polytheistic worship; a merely formal and superficial morality culminating in the hope of reward and the fear of punishment. These are the results of our investigations thus far; and all this together is called the Catholic view of the universe . The encyclical of Leo XIII, "Humanum genus," of April 20, 1884, was directed against the Freemasons, which it designated as "creatures who belong to the realm of Satan and the powers of hell .... a god-forsaken sect inspired by insolent spirits of the devil. Partisans of evil . . . . a foul contagion," etc. With this support a mischievous Frenchman, one Gabriel Jogand-Pagds, under the nom-de-plume "Leo Taxil," began to publish in a series of books and pam- phlets the most monstrous "revelations" of the alleged Devil-cult of the Freemasons, and at the same time to ingratiate himself into the confidence of the high and highest church dignitaries. His works were praised and advertised throughout the world by the ultramontane press. Bishops and cardinals sought his acquaint- ance and overwhelmed him with marks of favor. Pope Leo XIII himself received and blessed him, and displayed his library in which was a complete collection of Taxil's books, with the assurance that he had read them all . At last Taxil attended the celebrated anti-Freemason Congress at Trient in I896, at which he played a principal r61e and was hailed by some enthusiasts as a saint. And yet the entire literary activity of Taxil consisted in a collection of the craziest nonsense of a diseased fancy on the subject of hell, the Devil, and Devil-worship. Twelve years this scoffer led the ultramontane church by the nose, and then, himself, in a widely advertized meeting in Paris, April I9, 1897, exposed the entire fraud. Of course the Catholic press and literature strove to hush up this frightful reverse, but the official church learned nothing from it .... The recognition of the fact that the religious view of the universe held by the 9 Raynald, Annales Ecclesiastici, Tome XVI, p. 392.</page><page sequence="16">CRITICAL NOTES 253 Catholic church is no longer tenable begins, strictly speaking, in the time of the Renaissance and the Reformation, but only since the second half of the seventeenth century has it been connectedly and systematically opposed, and this opposition supported by the increase of philosophic, scientific, and historical knowledge. This war was called "Enlightenment," and toward the end of the eighteenth century its watchword was "Reason." We call this epoch that of rationalism. It is very significant that at first the rationalists did not assume a contradiction in principle between their religion of reason and historical Christianity. In the middle of the eighteenth century appeared a Scot of genius named David Hume who put an end to assumptions of compatibility between the two. Like a corro- sive acid his keen skepticism attacked the positive formations of Christendom as well as the rationalistic brain-specters of a religion growing out of rational thinking. Many persons consider him the founder of the modern science of religion ... In Germany it was Immanuel Kant who showed that the veritable roots of religion lay in the human inner life, and emphasized its connection with the moral will. According to Kant one can find the key to the super-sensuous only in him- self, only in his own conscience, and one is therefore, in the solution of the religious problem, free from all external authorities. With this the road was opened to a psychological conception of the nature of religion and many investigators entered. But they were not agreed on that function of the soul-activity which was para- mount, whether willing, thinking, or feeling played the principal part. Kant gave precedence to the will, Schleiermacher to emotion, and Hegel to the under- standing . Christianity was not, as the Catholic books for the young taught, the beginning of a new world; it was the end of an old world, a dream of world-weary oriental imagination .... And the Roman imperial politics would force this dream by persuasion or the sword on the peoples of the West, strong in their youth. But they cannot dream. They are not weary .... Rome lends the organization. Rome sends its agents and commissioners. Rome creates the firm "God's king- dom on earth," and of course pockets the profits of the business .... The Catholic laity goes into rationalism, romanticism, natural-science evolu- tion, and historical criticism just like the non-Catholics. Among the modern educated laity, as is well known, confessional differences are no longer of impor- tance. Indeed this world is rather indifferent to Christianity itself, but not honest enough to confess it .... And how stands it with the clergy? Is it sure of itself? I doubt it. It would be impossible for the Catholic clergy to withdraw itself from the mighty current of the times. Among its members are found men as enlightened and as highly educated as among the laity .... In the first half of the nineteenth century came the recognition of the fact that the existence of the church depended on her rational reconciliation with modern culture .... A leader of the debate in the French congregations said frankly in reference to the question of equal toleration for believers and non-believers:</page><page sequence="17">254 TIHE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY "We demand toleration from you on the ground of your principles, and we refuse it to you on the ground of ours." .... "Professor" means one not only who has a conviction but one who avows it. Savant means not only a tolerator but if need be a warrior. And if it is disgraceful for a soldier to desert his flag, it is a hundred times more disgraceful for an apostle of free science to be derelict in the defense of his spiritual inheritance from his father's time .... If this recognition of facts were accompanied by vigorous action the hoary phantoms of the Catholic view of the universe would be blown away out of the halls of the Alma Mater with a breath. An objection might be made as to the Catholic theological faculties on the ground that they are regular parts of our Hochschulen; they are called to represent the Catholic view of the universe. I grant the first statement but I deny the last .... Pius X has made an end of Catholic theology .... Middle-age scholastics, according to Thomas Aquinas, can be taught, but scholastic theology has no longer the character of a science . We desire now to regard the relation between religion and science only in its relation to the whole, only from the point of view of its value for the culture of mankind. For only that which in some way serves the interests of mankind; that which in some way satisfies their needs, has value. The inner force which works in man for the satisfaction of his requirements we call, as is known, impulse. Unquestionably among these impulses, that of ascertaining the real, the thirst for truth, plays an important part, and only science can satisfy it. But from a much deeper source, and with greater force than the last, is that impulse in the human breast which we may best call self-preservation, or, by the general catch-word, impulse for happiness. That means the longing to satisfy the wish to be happy and contented. Can the knowledge of truth satisfy this craving ? If we are hungry, is our appetite satisfied by the knowledge that we have noth- ing to eat ? And if our heart is tortured by great suffering does the thought console us that it is incurable ? No. Truth often has too bitter a kernel. And therefore it is perfectly correct when one tells us: "The soul of man strives in the first instance to obtain, not truth, but the conditions which it needs in order to live." But furthermore I maintain that men struggle against truth if it interfere with their intended happiness; and when you give them the truth they themselves make a deception of it. Is that not intelligible? I see around me reality. I would like to have it otherwise. What can I do ? I can try by struggle and work to actually change it. Only in the rarest instances and under the most favorable circumstances can I succeed. But I can succeed much more easily by creating another world within myself which corresponds with my desires. And though this inner world is repudiated a hundred times by my fellow-beings, and though it is a hundred times inconsistent with reality, for me it is true and real so soon as my soul has dwelt in it, so soon as I am convinced of its existence. Thus we</page><page sequence="18">CRITICAL NOTES 255 recognize the difference between an objective and a subjective conviction. We recognize that along with the sensible world a great broad world of illusion exists. Not in vain does man long in this world, and one can retire from the storms and thorns of life. This world is open to that ideal force which we call religion .... Ludwig Feuerbach says, "God is the satisfaction in fancy of the longing of mankind for happiness." . . . . We understand why strong heroic natures gen- erally show little taste for religion because they do not need support so much as others, and they prefer fighting to dreaming .... Finally we see why religion is unconquerable because in her roots she is nothing else than the impulse for self-preservation. Religion is not vulnerable by science so long as the first does not leave the realm of illusion. Yet I do not confound religion and illusion. One could call them both sisters but not such as must go hand-in-hand .... Buddhism in its original form is a religion which dispenses with all illusions. .... The Catholic church is not in conflict with science because it makes use of illusions, but because it not only does not confine these illusions to the subjective feeling of the believers, but wishes to substitute them to all mankind for the outer world, and to compel their acceptance by force. In so doing the church has crossed the barrier behind which religion is unconquerable and invaded the realm of the real, in which one must have the courage to hold truth higher than happiness. And as the church conducts herself in a strange house in a tyrannical and unseemly manner, the mistress of that house, vastly superior to her in strength, has incon- tinently put her out. Here she wallows in the wide domain of coarseness, appeals to the instinct of the masses to help her to capture and destroy the house; she covers the defenders of the house with scorn and shame, with reproaches of godlessness, unbelief, crime, etc..... And yet science has her God and her creed-not a god which created man in his own image in order later to allow him to resemble the beast . . . . but a godwhich allows his creatures, by constant becoming and disappearing, to attain continually higher forms of being, .... and who gives us the consolation that by unremitting toil and honest effort we may approach ever nearer to perfection. And in this belief the sword-bearers of science draw: a host, not infallible, not the monopolists of happiness, but yet victorious, and invincible, the leaders of mankind through the milleniums; the head erect whatever may come, and the glance straight out into the dawning future. SUBSEQUENT CONTROVERSY Professor P. Fonck, S. J., is a colleague of Professor Wahrmund, and fills the chair of Bible exegesis in Innsbruck. Shortly after the appearance in print of the lecture, of which the preceding is a summary, Father Fonck issued a pamphlet violently attacking it, and principally on four grounds. These were, (i) that Wahrmund had copied parts of Hoensbroech and Haeckel; (2) that no justification could be found in any works of the "great Catholic theologians" for the morality which he ascribed to the church;</page><page sequence="19">256 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY (3) there was no basis for his account of the exorcising of the Devil in Wem- ding; and (4) his description of the character of Pope Clement VI was baseless. To this Professor Wahrmund replied in four articles which dealt with these points of attack. The first is not of much interest to the foreign reader. It concerns the question whether or not Professor Wahrmund copied from Hoensbroech and Haeckel. The perfectly baseless charge is too trivial to waste space upon it. The second charge was that Professor Wahrmund, in quoting Alfonso de Liguori, had copied a forgery of Count Hoensbroech. "Where is a single Catholic moralist who justifies an adulteress or a murderer as Professor Wahrmund asserts ?" says Father Fonck. Through lack of space Wahr- mund's reply is here cut down to telegraph-like laconism. At the outside he acknowledges that almost all the great Catholic theologians were and are Jesuits. The Jesuit, Sanchez, says, "When the words [used in an oath] are ambiguous or susceptible of two meanings it is no sin to use them in the sense which the speaker extracts from them even if the hearers and the person to whom the oath is made understand the words in another sense..... Even when the words are not ambiguous and do not convey the sense which the speaker expresses, it is no lie if, considering the accompanying circumstances of place, time, person, and manner of the question, the words represent the purpose of the speaker. Thus one may deny in the confessional having committed an offense if he have already confessed it. Asked if he have seen someone, he may deny it if he have not seen the person very recently. The adulteress, questioned by her husband, may deny having broken her marriage, because up to that time the marriage remains unbroken, though faithfulness to her marriage vows may have been broken."'o The same Sanchez" finds moral approval for all imagi- nable cases. The Jesuit, Laymann,'2 is of the opinion that an ambiguous oath if not absolute perjury entails no blame if the cause be a just one: "Whoso should say to a woman 'I will take you to wife' may deny under oath before a court to have used these words, with the mental reservation 'of my own free will.'" The Jesuit, Escobar,'3 from the works of twenty-four authorities of the Jesuits, shows that they and he agree with Sanchez as to ambiguous speech, oaths of two interpretations, and mental reservations. The Jesuit, Tamburini, states the following question: "The question is whether it be permitted for the taker of an oath to use his words in another sense than that which they express. For instance 'I swear by God that during this to Opus Morale in Praecepta Decalogi, Antwerp, I624, Lib. III, cap. vi, p. 353- "z Consilia seu Opuscula Moralia, Lyons, I634. 12 Theologia Moralis, 9th ed., Mainz, 1723.

Answer: it is permitted, and not only where one is compelled to swear, but when he has voluntarily done so. The reason is that in these cases God is only called to witness the truth."'4 The Jesuit, Busenbaum, says: "To swear with ambiguity, if a just ground exist and ambiguity in itself be allowed, is not evil: for where the right exists to conceal the truth and it is concealed without a lie, the oath suffers no disregard. Even if it be done without just ground it is no per- jury if at least in any sense of the words, or with a mental reservation, the truth be sworn to."'s With especial detail Saint Alfonso de Liguori treats this subject in the eight volumes of his Theologia Moralis which have been distributed in countless edi- tions, praised in the entire literature, and have aided the author to the dignity of the title of "church teacher." Amongst other citations these may be mentioned: If, for example, one says" God knows," "God will witness," "I speak by God," "I swear that the affair stands thus as truly as a God exists"-none of these things imply a proper oath. But if one says "I call God to witness," or "by my oath," then an actual oath has been taken .... A witness questioned by a judge in other than legal form may deny a crime, mentally adding-concerning which he can be legally questioned, or which he must avow (IV, 154)..... . . One who has promised marriage but is not forced to fulfil the promise, may deny it altogether, mentally adding, "by which I am bound." Whoso is not forced to pay duty may deny having anything dutiable, adding mentally, "for which I must pay." . . . . In the case of a false oath, when in a low tone a true circumstance is mentioned, Liguori decides that it is permissible in case anyone has heard the sound, even if the sense were not intelligible .... In the case of one who, with the intention of swearing, but without the intention of being bound, has taken an oath, Liguori decides he is not compelled to fulfil the oath .... Whoso ruins a virgin under a promise of marriage not seriously meant, is not compelled to the fulfilment of the promise if he be considerably above the girl in social standing, or considerably richer (IV, 642, 643). Rich adulterers who send their illegitimate children to the foundling hospital are not obliged, according to the probabilismus doctrine, to pay anything for their support (IV, 656). The )esuit, Gury, in two large works'6 takes pains to extend further the moral precepts of Liguori, and to perfect them. '4 Explicatio Decalogi, Venice, 1719.

A further example from the same work: "Anna, asked by her husband if she have broken her marriage vows, .... answers the first time, she has not broken the marriage vows. The second time, after having been absolved from her sin, she replies, 'I am not guilty of such a crime.' The third time. . . . she says, 'I have not committed it,' adding mentally, 'an adultery which I must declare.' Has Anna done wrong ? No. In all three cases she is to be exonerated from the fault of lying."'8 The Jesuit, Lehmkulil, recently published a great work on morals'9 in which these subjects are fully treated in the traditional method above indicated, and though he condemns the lie, he holds ambiguity of speech and mental reservation permissible.20 For the spirit of this book let the following be adduced: "It must be conceded that frequently there may be a fellow of so bad a reputation that it is no great sin to load upon him a new offense; occasionally the false charge of a new crime can hardly have, for him, the significance of increased dishonor, but is merely a simple lie .... Who believes that a serious calumny is committed by him who avows that he considers an atheist capable of committing any crime in secret ?" This might be prolonged indefinitely, says Professor Wahrmund in substance, but enough has been shown to render less acute the pious indig- nation of Professor Fonck, as well as to show him that he is unacquainted with the moralists of his own order, "the great Catholic theologians." In his attack Father Fonck denied that Wahrmund had any authority for his account of the exorcism of the devil by Father Aurelian in Wemding. Wahrmund's reply to this is unanswerable. It is the reprint of the official account published by Father Aurelian"2 with the authorization of the bishop of Eichstatt. It closes with the words "This statement is made by Father Aurelian who exorcized the devil, as a perpetual remembrance for the provincial archives, Altitting, as well as for the cloister archives of Wemding." Shortly after it was printed the edition was recalled and destroyed on account of the excessive merriment which the narration caused in all quarters. The copy which was in Professor Wahrmund's possession when he used it as an illustration, belonged to a large landholder in the vicinity of Wemding, and is a rarity, and perhaps a unique copy.

With the utmost detail and with careful references to the sources of his information Wahrmund shows that Clement VI was a worldly, pomp-loving lord; "of courtly distinction and with noble passions." J. Haller== describes him as an elegant prelate of noble family, a man of the world with the faults of his class, namely, extravagance, love of pleasure, and lax morality, etc. In short, his exactions, under different pretexts, present a picture of the rankest immorality and injustice. The charges and the authorities cited in sup- port of them establish Professor Wahrmund's contention without the possibility of refutation. There are only two methods open to Professor Wahrmund's opponents to lessen or destroy the effect of his powerful indictment. Either they must deny the authoritative character of the works which he cites, or they must challenge his correct translation of the texts. Both courses are beset by the gravest difficulties.
