<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SPIRIT IN THE MATERIAL: A CASE STUDY OF ANIMISM IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST Christine S. VanPool and Elizabeth Newsome People often imbue their surroundings, including tools, with a "life essence" that makes them active objects. A growing number of archaeologists are beginning to study how such "living" beings impact human behavior. These archaeologists use the term "object agency," but employ many different ontological approaches. We explore this variation, and present a framework comparing different ontological models archaeologists use. We adopt an animistic perspective, and evaluate its applicability to the Southwest using ethnographic and archaeological data. We further propose that it is applicable through out the New World. Puebloan potters consider pots living beings with a spiritual essence that is affected by and that impacts humans. Pottery manufacture is a mutual negotiation between the potter and the clay to create a "Made Being" with its own spiritual and material aspects. We conclude that a similar ontology is reflected in effigy pots and globular jars from the Casas Grandes region. Ultimately we conclude that this perspective provides useful insights into the placement, deco ration, and discard of many vessels that have puzzled Southwestern archaeologists for decades. Con frecuencia la gente impregna su medio ambiente, incluyendo sus herramientas, con una "esencia vital " que los convierte en objetos activos. Un número creciente de arqueólogos están comenzando a estudiar cómo tales seres "vivientes" afectan el comportamiento humano. Estos arqueólogos usan el término "objeto agencia." pero usan muchos enfoques ontológicos. Nosotros exploramos esta variación y presentamos un marco comparativo de los diferentes modelos ontológicos que los arqueól ogos usan. Adoptamos una perspectiva animista y evaluamos su aplicabilidad al Suroeste usando datos etnográficos y arque ológicos. Además proponemos que es aplicable a todo el Nuevo Mundo. Alfareros Pueblo consideran sus vasijas como seres vivientes con una esencia espiritual que es afectada por y que impacta a los humanos. Lit fabricación de alfarería es una nego ciación mutua entre el alfarero y la arcilla para crear un "Ser Hecho" el cual tiene sus propios aspectos espirituales y mate riales. Concluimos que una ontología similar es reflejada en vasijas efigie y jarras globulares de la región de Casas Grandes. Finalmente concluimos que este enfoque provee perspectivas útiles sobre la distribución, decoración, y abandono de muchas vasijas que han sido un enigma para los arqueólogos del Suroeste por décadas.

Not all spirits are the same, however. A funda mental difference is the distinction between "Raw" Gifts to and from Mother Earth and "Made" Bcin8s' Raw BeinSs reflect the Pri" mordial "essences" of the cosmos. "Made Be Parsons (1996) and Lamphere (1983) note many ings" are formed from "Raw Beings" (Young linguistic and cultural differences at the various 1988). Humans are Made Beings. So are pots. We Pueblos (Hopi, Zuni, Acoma, and the Rio Grande explore the archaeological significance of pottery Pueblos), but suggest their religious principles as Made Beings here. The easiest way to do this is and ceremonialism are remarkably similar (Figure using a life history perspective, in which the pot is 3). Most significant to this discussion is the ani- formed (born), lives, and dies. Below we discuss mistic worldview shared with most Amerindians Cushing's (1886) concept of Made Beings (which (Bonvillain 2001; Harvey 2006; Parsons 1996: should not to be confused with Ortiz's [1969]</page><page sequence="6">248 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 77, No. 2,2012 "Made People" who are religious leaders with im- ( 1972[ 1929] : 16) quotes a Zuni potter saying, portant ritual roles among the Tewa speakers).

Bunzel (1992[1933]:490) states that, as a passive, beautiful object (Trimble 2004:29) She and others hope that the following experience is typical of those who interact with their pots: the village.

Grandes potters viewed pots as people with af fecting presences is further augmented by a Playas Red jar found under Reservoir 2 at Paquimé (Fig ure 8). At the bottom and center of the reservoir was a shaft that went down to a rock slab cover ing a Playas Red jar with a necklace of shell and turquoise around its neck (Di Peso 1974:2:347). The jar also contained turquoise, shell, slate, and bovid horn core fragments (likely bison, but per haps Mountain Sheep). Regardless of their theo retical perspective, archaeologists view the Playas Red jar as symbolically linked to the reservoir (Di Peso 1974:2:347). Ethnographic analogy with Southwestern peoples suggests the shells, turquoise, and other objects are water offerings (Di Peso 1974; VanPool and VanPool 2007). From a Cartesian perspective the pot is passive; it merely holds objects for water symbolism and rit ual. We propose, however, that the jar itself was an active agent. It wears a necklace like those worn by the Casas Grandes people, indicating an intentional metaphor with people who also wore jewelry. After all, the materials used for the neck lace could have been placed in the jar, if the jar was intended to simply hold offerings. The dec oration of the jar with a necklace similar to those used by humans reflects a conceptual relationship between the two, we suggest. As an agent, we pro pose the jar's placement reflects its active role in the community; this pot served as an intermediary with the watery underworld to help preserve and maintain the water that was central to Paquimé (VanPool and VanPool 2007). The shaft that holds the vessel acts as a sipapu (an axis mundi—a portal between the underworld and the middle world; humans emerged through it from previous worlds) that allows the pot access both to the middle and the lower worlds. Non-human agents acting as intermediaries with the spirit world has previously been documented ethnographically in the Southwest using rock art (Young 1988). We propose this phenomenon is manifested here. Recognizing this will provide greater insight into ritual and religion in the Casas Grandes culture. The focus of the two examples presented above is to establish the plausibility of extending an an imistic framework to the Medio period system.

Using an ex plicitly interpretive framework, we have illus trated the likely presence of an animistic ontology during the Medio period and shown how it can clarify aspects of the archaeological record in useful ways. A pot wearing a necklace, globular jars with faces, hand drums scattered in multiple locations, and "sacrificed" effigy vessels shift from being confusing, idiosyncratic variation, to being expected and readily explainable. More significantly, the animistic perspective allows the recognition of semantic linkages that would oth erwise be obscured. Most (probably) would ac cept that the reservoir pot is a religious offering of some sort, but this does not reveal the semantic categories relating it to other cosmological aspects reflected at Paquimé. It is an incomplete, and un satisfying, explanation rather like having puzzle pieces that you can't fit together. A meaningful explanation requires that the ontological structure creating and organizing the semantic categories is reconstructed. It matters to our interpretation of the archaeological record whether people con sider pots living, because only through under standing this can we determine the significance of killed pots, pots in burials, and offering such as the reservoir pot. Very different interpretations will be warranted based on our determination of the ontological status of pots. Archaeologists have become increasingly so phisticated in their analysis of religion and ritual (Rakita and Buikstra 2008). While we focus on only one Southwestern culture, we believe the an alytic framework we propose will be applicable in other cultures in the Southwest, the New World, and indeed around the world. After all, our theo retical discussion is derived largely from Old World examples (e.g., Gell 1998). Given the ubiq uity of animism throughout the world, the frame work we propose should be generally applicable, but cultures do differ in the importance/structure of animism. In some cases, perspectives toward the bottom of Figure 1 will be appropriate, whereas in other cases, those toward the top will be a better in terpretive structure. Archaeologists should explic itly consider the underlying ontological impor tance of the metaphysical/spiritual role artifacts likely played, if they are seriously going to con tribute to the archaeology of religion, cosmology, and symbolism. It is true that a good cooking pot must have certain characteristics, and that perfor mance analysis can help elucidate what cooking pots were used for and why they were made the way they were. However, this is not ALL there is to pottery. As the quote we used to start this paper indicates, archaeologists can and should recog nize that the social meaning of pots and other ar tifacts go beyond their day-to-day use. We have sought here to present a methodology to do so, and hope that archaeological analysis can expand the study of other personhoods. Acknowledgments.

Notes 1. Southwestern archaeologists rarely find prehistoric kilns. Perhaps because of their sacred nature they were not left intact and hence are not easily found. 2. We explore this theme more completely in VanPool and VanPool (2010*) in which we propose that the pot and its con tents were placed at the bottom of the reservoir during its con struction to help make the reservoir into a Made Being with an active presence. Thus, the pot would reflect part of the human contribution to the Reservoir's spirit in a manner analogous to the way the potter contributes to a pot's spirit.
