The investigation is one of several involving long- term, intensive observations of this species on definite areas in Wisconsin and Iowa. Because of the accu- racy and continuity of winter censuses there and the relative clearness of the ecological picture displayed by some types of "key" data, Prairie du Sac is regarded in many ways as the most informative of the areas. Although the early studies at Prairie du Sac have been well covered in the literature, data acquired over the greater part of a decade remain to be reported. These do more than merely pyramid evidence on phenomena that were adequately understood after the first years of work. It is true, for example, that virtually as much was known about starvation in wintering bobwhites by the mid-thirties as now but a number of concepts of population mechanics have been importantly modified by evidence more recently becoming apparent. The present paper, despite the increasing refer- ence to many species of animals that may be noted as treatment progresses, is essentially restricted in scope to the bobwhite. Even what may appear to be outright digressions are purposely included for the bearing they have upon the main subject matter. Nevertheless, the paper also is prepared in the hope that it may take us closer to principles of popula- tions in higher vertebrates, generally, especially as relates to automatic controls and adjustments in rates of loss and gain. The original Prairie du Sac data, here summarized, accrue from about 1,000 man-days of field work. The 1929-32 studies were conducted throughout the year, chiefly by me but also with the help of Albert J. Gastrow, an experienced outdoorsman, resi- dent in the area. This was done in connection with a program established at the University of Wisconsin by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufac- turers' Institute and the Bureau of Biological Survey, formerly of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Thereafter, the area's investigations with which we are concerned in this paper consisted of winter (Octo- ber or November to April) censuses and observations by Gastrow and were financed through Iowa coopera- tion (Iowa State College and the former Iowa Fish and Game Commission, with the aid of funds con- tributed by J. N. ("Ding") Darling), 1932-34; Wis- consin Alumni Research Foundation and the Iowa cooperators, 1934-35; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, 1935-36; National Association of Audu- bon Societies, 1936-37; Thomas E. Brittingham, 1937-38; Aldo Leopold, 1938-39; Wisconsin Con- servation Commission (Pittman-Robertson funds), 1939-40 and first part of 1940-41; Aldo Leopold, second part of 1940-41; Wisconsin Conservation Commission (Pittman-Robertson funds), 1941-44. In 1933, the year following my change of residence from Wisconsin to Iowa, the 1929-32 findings on wintering of bobwhites on the Prairie du Sac and other Wisconsin areas were published (18). The Prai- rie du Sac studies continued under my supervision until the spring of 1935 and furnished much of the basis for a long report in 1936 (33). During later years, while continuing to examine each season's data as they became available, I made no visits to the area, and the credit for keeping the program alive should be given very largely to the efforts-sometimes per- sonal sacrifice-of Aldo Leopold, Professor of Wild- life Management at the University of Wisconsin. From 1941 to 1943, according to our opportunities, Leopold and I worked over the data with a view to- ward joint publication; by 1944, however, Leopold's schedule permitted no further expenditure of time on the project, and he invited me to go ahead on my own responsibility with the preparation of the manuscript. Not here reported are supplementary studies at Prairie du Sac, begun in 1941 by members of the staff of the Department of Wildlife Management of the University of Wisconsin. Data from these will be written up for separate publication by the persons responsible for them. Numerous individuals and organizations other than those already mentioned have given major help, some of which will later be acknowledged in appropriate places in text or bibliography. Among others de- serving thanks for their cooperation, especially in the early years, are E. D. Ochsner of Prairie du Sac and W. B. Grange, now of Babcock, Wis. THE AREA The 4,500 acre study area (Fig. 1) lies on the east side of the Wisconsin River, at the corner of Columbia and Dane counties, opposite the village of Prairie du Sac. It includes the 3,200 acres referred to in other publications and in addition some border- ing land. It is situated in the "dairy belt" of south- central Wisconsin, and has hills partly covered by hardwoods and valleys in pasture or cultivation. Here, the bobwhite lives on the northern edge of its established range. To the northward are found only frontier populations of this "farm game" bird, usually sparse and discontinuous, though sporadically abundant (50, p. 45).</page><page sequence="4">The Prairie du Sac, Arc-a ,X~~~~~rlo B e~~~~~~Uk a n , , { ~~~~~~~~~~An .

Most woodlots were pastured and some were slashed. Trees and shrubs resistant to grazing by cattle encroached on sandy tracts and steep slopes. Frequent debrushing of roadsides produced its own plant and animal successions. Professor Leopold and Cvril Kabat, a graduate student who has done much work on the area, judge, on the basis of the 1934-35 cover map (33, pp. 394-395) and the recollections of Gastrow, that cover conditions for the bobwhite have long been deteriorating. No artificial feeding, cover improvement, control of hunting or other form of bobwhite management was attempted. Hunting seasons on this species opened during the autumns of 1932 to 1935 and, on the Dane County part of the area, again in 1942 and 1943, but negligible numbers of the local birds were shot. Hunting of rabbits and squirrels and trapping of fur-bearers was similar to that usually carried on throughout the region. There were no "anti-vermin" *0' in4) 1331-32 I 'X' ale ZE' 2Q' le ae AlfIC PAA campaigns; sometimes a hunter or a farmer shot a hawk or an owl. Foxes were hunted on occasion for sport or pelts. On the whole, resident wildlife was neither subject to excessive exploitation (or persecu- tion) nor given more than passive encouragement. For research on a species as relatively sedentary as the bobwhite, the Prairie du Sac area has many advantages. Nearly half of its periphery is bounded by a river sufficiently wide to discourage crossing by these birds at any season. On other sides, extensive tracts of habitat unfavorable for wintering bobwhites (deep woods and bare fields) help to reduce the chances of covey ranges being partly in and partly out of the area-one of the worst sources of confusion in many studies. The variables due to ingress and egress of wintering coveys are also lessened by the area's large size, as the majority of the coveys resi- dent may engage in "normal" movements without crossing the borders. In most winters, tracking snows come often enough and last long enough to facilitate census-taking and "reading of sign."

ERRINGTON Ecological Monographs Vol. 15, NO. 1 Furthermore, the area is one of those on which H. L. Stoddard had spent his early years as a natu- ralist. After completion of the Cooperative Quail Investigation of southeastern United States in 1929 (66), he served as Biological Survey supervisor for a number of newly initiated cooperative studies of wild gallinaceous birds, including this one of Wisconsin bobwhites. The local program at Prairie du Sac was begun upon his advice and under his excellent guid- ance in the field. WEATHER BACKGROUND No precise weather data are available from Prairie du Sac for the period of study, so we must substitute records of the U. S. Weather Bureau for Madison, which is about 20 miles southeast of the area. Figure 2 depicts temperature and snow depths for each winter except 1943-44, with times of simul- taneous cold and snow being hatched for emphasis. Figure 3 is an extension through 1942 of Wade's (67) use of an index of drought intensity proposed by Munger (59), the base of each triangle covering a time in which no rain exceeded a twentieth of an inch per day. Figures 2 and 3 are not claimed to register in- fluence of weather upon the bobwhite. As will later be shown, the winter of 1931-32, which looks mild on the chart, was terminated by a lethal emergency, and the winters of 1932-33 and 1934-35 look more similar when charted than one might expect from a far greater mortality associated with weather in 1934-35. Likewise, the mild-appear- ing winters, 1936-38, brought ice-storms and other ungraphed emergencies. The extremely severe winter of 1935-36 registers very well, but the "Armistice Day Blizzard" of November 11-13, 1940, looks un- impressive, although it killed many animals ordinarily weather-proof. In Figure 3, the intensity of the 1934 drought appears far to surpass that of 1936. The latter summer does not look appreciably drier than most of the other summers, yet Wade (67, p. 560) states that "the damage done in 1936 was at least as great as in 1934." POPULATION STATUS OF WILD HIGHER VERTEBRATES OTHER THAN BOBWHITES It is axiomatic that the ecology of a wild animal cannot be thoroughly studied without reference to the associated biota. There are also practical limits to the scope of an investigation that can be carried on intensively by a few persons. In this, an intensive study of the northern bob- white, the associated species considered especially worthy of attention fell into three categories: (a) predatory species, (b) so-called buffer species, and (e) species possibly competing with the bobwhite as phyletically related forms. PREDATORS Presented in Table 1 are the available figures on winter densities of the principal large raptorial birds, foxes, and certain small and medium-sized fur-bearers. The number of great horned owls (Bubo virgin- ianuts) regularly wintering on the area varied from four to eight and averaged six, or about one per square mile. In most springs, a nest was found for each two owls, but, in 1937, 1940, and 1944, no nests were found, and it is unlikely that any were overlooked. Food habits and prey relations of the species have recently been discussed at some length (34). The number of apparently wintering red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis borealis) varied from four to eight and averaged five. Field evidence indicates that these were mainly permanent residents, and, in springs when nesting data were procured, there were usually nests corresponding to every two wintering individuals listed in the notes. Failure to record nests in 1937 is laid to nonbreeding, but it is possible that late nests may have been missed. The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoarqcnteus) has den- ning and ranging habits that simplify winter census work. In the early years of the study, density cal- culations were checked against numbers of animals known to have been taken in particular neighbor- hoods by hunters and trappers. Maximum winter densities of around five per square mile are suggested by the data both from Prairie du Sac and from an- other area near Blue Mounds, 18 miles to the south- I APR/L -I4Y I LawC I c/'Y 1AU,161/ST 7 EPTERI 13291 41 " 1931&gt; tiA 4 i,1 z. l.X 4 A ;4 1. 1933Idj- i'v1z1 *1 &amp;a4 1o9I3A A A 1A I AA4 'A 1941 ii!i i4iAAAJiAA4 A 44 A14 is38~AA4 i A ~ A AA- FIG. 3.

The recent decline may have had a counter- part many years ago, for, after previous absence, the species was said to have reappeared locally in 1925 (50, p. 221). Population figures for the red foxes (Vulpes sp.), which range beyond the area, should not be regarded as censuses, though Gastrow is an expert "still hunter" of red foxes and his opinion as to numbers should be close to the facts. The figures on striped skunk (Mephitis sp.), mink (Mustela vison), weasels (Mustela spp.), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and opossum (Didelphis virginiana) are usually based upon Gastrow's winter estimates. Not listed in Table 1, dogs (Canis familiaris) and house cats (Felis domestica) were about as abundant as they ordinarily are in midwest farming communi- ties. Stomach contents of the few, feral cats col- lected were similar to those of gray foxes. Gastrow estimated that there were five badgers (Taxidea taxus) resident in the winter of 1941-42; eight alive by the end of the winter of 1942-43; and 15 in 1943-44. Of miscellaneous raptorial birds, barred owls (Strix varia) occurred regularly near the area but not often on it. Screeeh owls (Otus asio) were also to be found in some places, and there were variable populations of long-eared owls (Asio otus wilson- ianuts) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus). Coop- er's hawks (Accipiter cooperii) and marsh hawks (Circus cyaneus hudsonius) were often seen in sum- mer and were irregular winter visitors. Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) wintered along the river; Gastrow has seen as many as seven in one day. Snowy owls (Nyctea scandiaca) and saw-whet owls (Cryptoglaux acadica) appeared infrequently in win- ter. Three goshawks (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus) stayed on the area for about a week in 1935-36 and another was recorded for early winter, 1943-44. "BUFFERS" Before 1941-42, when H. C. Hanson, a graduate student of Professor Leopold, made careful censuses of small mammals and birds (unpublished), no nu- merical data on "buffer" densities were obtained; great changes in populations were noted, however. Cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus) were considered "normal" for the area up to and including the win- ter of 1935-36. For 1936-37, Gastrow judged the cottontail population to be only about one-third "normal," and low densities were reported for other southern Wisconsin counties (53). Recovery at Prairie du Sac was visible by the winter of 1937-38; for the next two winters, numbers were again "normal"; and in 1940-41, Gastrow commented that he never before had known the rabbits to be so numerous. In 1942- 43, they again were abundant; in 1943-44, much less so. The white-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus townsendii campanius) has long been found on a sand prairie west of Prairie du Sac but occurrence on the area itself has been irregular. The principal mice were meadow mice (Microtus spp.) and deer mice (Peromryscus spp.) of which the former showed much more pronounced fluctuations. It was plain that meadow mice were exceedingly abundant in 1929, 1938, and 1942, and there also was evidence (from their representations in the diets of local predators) that they may have reached an- other peak in 1934. The barn rat (Rattus norvegicus) spread into fields from farm yards in the warmer months but seemed unable to winter far away from buildings. Populations of fox and gray squirrels (Sciurus niger rufiventer and S. carolinensis) appeared to be sparse but rather stable. Other resident sciurids in- cluded the woodchuck (Marmota monax), chipmunk (Tamias striatus), flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans),</page><page sequence="8">8 PAUL LS. ERRINGTON Ecological Monographs 8 PAUL L. ERRINGTON ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Vol. 15, No. 1 and the two common ground squirrels, Citellus tri- decemlineaths and C. franklini. WILD GALLIFORMES Semiannual population figures for ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbelluts) and ring-necked pheasants (Pha' sianmts colchicus torquatus) are given farther on in this paper, in Figures 12 and 6, respectively. Neither grouse nor pheasant data are uniformly accurate, being for some seasons no more than estimates based upon miscellaneous "sign." The grouse may be re- garded much more as true residents of the area than may the more mobile pheasants, which drifted irreg- ularly across the land boundaries. Judging from the annual survivors as noted in spring, the ruffed grouse populations wintered with fair security during the first 12 years at or under levels of 18 to 20 birds. In 1941-44, they varied from 30 to 38 (the spring density for 1944 was 32, not given in Fig. 12), or at levels approximately twice those for the earlier years. These grouse were legally protected throughout the study and, like the bobwhites, suffered little shooting. Unlike the bob- whites, they were not very susceptible to winter emergencies. Large-scale pheasant stocking in Wisconsin began in 1928, but at Prairie du Sac, these exotic birds have not as yet shown any strong ascendancy-unless the 1941-42 density be so considered. A local farmer released 30 to 80 artificially propagated pheasants in August of each year since 1939. Of other wild Galliformes, a flock of about 74 prairie chickens (Tympanuchits cupido pinnatus) was seen on the area in January, 1933. SEMIANNUAL CENSUS DATA FOR THE PRAIRIE DU SAC BOBWHITE POPULATIONS The data for the area's spring and fall populations of bobwhites, presented in Figure 4, were obtained by direct enumerations of local birds (for description of techniques, see 18, pp. 1-11; 33, pp. 310-333), which I have endeavored to sum up as for comparable times of each year. Some trends may be detected in the gross fluctua- tions, but others are so obscured by variables as to be meaningless without further exposition. This is notably true with respect to winter losses after 1933- 34, many of the summer gains after 1935, and the similarities the fluctuations may have with those of other species. Readers are therefore advised not to strive over- hard to draw conclusions from Figure 4 but to keep it in mind for reference as the discussion progresses. BOBWHITE WINTER LOSSES AND THRESHOLDS OF BASIC SECURITY DISSOCIATION OF VARIABLES During the winters of my active participation in the field work at Prairie du Sac, emphasis was placed upon detection and analysis of mortality and of intereovey adjustments. Fewer details were ob- tained thereafter, except as related to census figures, until the beginning of the supplementary studies by Professor Leopold's graduate students in 1941-42. Prior to banding started by Kabat in 1942-43, con- clusions arrived at through field observations on win- ter movements of Prairie du Sac bobwhites were checked mainly with the findings from earlier band- ing near Madison (17) and with those from Stoddard's extensive banding program in southeastern United States (66, pp. 167-182). Local movements were commonly followed with satisfaction for coveys liv- ing well inside of the traversable boundaries of the area, but the fortunes of border covevs were not always readily ascertained. Abrupt disappearance of such flocks that had been wintering without much loss was considered reasonably good evidence that they had moved out. Sometimes such coveys soon returned and sometimes the courses of those depart- ing were traced. The area's winter egress tended to exceed its ingress, especially at the northeast corner where the birds could almost be depended upon to leave before a winter was over. When a covey starved, the evidence was character- istic and not likely to be overlooked or misinterpreted by an experienced observer, even when complicated by killing weather and by raiding and scavenging of flesh-eaters (18, 27). Outright losses due to weather were less easily appraised, as were the consequences of burning, close pasturing, fall plowing, and similar human activities that may often leave large tracts of land nearly foodless and coverless for bobwhites. Circumstantial evidence of declines associated with these factors was acceptable only with reservations. Voluminous data on food habits of locally resident predatory birds and mammals-particularly horned owls, which proved to be exceptionally good indi- cators of vulnerability (26)-were obtained in the early years of the investigations. Much "sign" of killing or eating of bobwhites was found then and dur- s0-Hanslel C0^&gt;sv p-RhodS (figure 'r rfly oa of loto two-ch to Apron .fal Adi,,a 0"d as atlof ere 0%o fg 0 vv I I93O J31 I932II9V3 tJ34I/9J35S 96 VJ97 /93O 1939 1940 /94 1942 1943 400 6 I I 3~~~~~~53 30 U ~ ~ 9Q 28 27-3 Id3 t00 976 z 70 70 FIG. 4.

Responses of predators were correlated as much as possible with changes in avail- ability of covey groups at times of hunger crises and of increased intraspecific friction, massing, and wan- dering (24, 33, 34). At its best, this was the most carefully executed part of the work, but the data are by no means of uniform quality. Losses from accident, shooting (especially if il- legal), pathology, and atypical immaturity, though difficult to record on a quantitative basis, clearly were not responsible for any extreme reductions in the bobwhite populations wintering at Prairie du Sac. Discoveries of feathers and picked bones were considered of very limited analytical significance un- less contemporaneous loss trends were otherwise well defined-as by the contents of owl pellets or nests, bunched remains of covey groups at sites of melted snowdrifts, and underweight carcasses or feeble flight powers of members of starv ng coveys. EMERGENCY AND NONEMERGENCY LOSSES Emergency losses for bobwhites are those reflecting weather extremes, drastic though temporary reduction in habitability of environment, and the impacts of many of the special hazards introduced by civilized man. Losses from subhuman predators, collectively, are here considered of emergency types only when suffered by bobwhites made vulnerable primarily as a result of an emergency, i.e., birds weakened by hunger, crippled by shot wounds, evicted by snow or ice storms, floods, fires, etc. Nonemergency wintering losses are broadly those suffered by populations of "normal," mature birds living free from adverse human interference in en- vironment which, favorable or not, retains practically its full winter habitability. In other words, non- emergency losses at Prairie du Sac are of types to be expected in mild, open winters, among bobwhites that have little to contend with except their own selves and their usual kinds of enemies and competitors, hence are about the minimal losses consistent with anything to be called naturalness. In looking over the following wintering histories the reader may avoid the confusion of possible fine- drawn distinctions by keeping a few things strictly in mind. In practice; our chief preliminary task will be to winnow out, by one means or another, the declines occurring: (a) directly through predation; (b) through population adjustments of the birds, themselves; or (c) through predation and adjust- ments in combination. This done, when we have reconstructed a picture of what the histories were or probably would have been in the absence of emergencies, we should be better able to search for basic attributes of north- central bobwhite populations. WINTERING HISTORIES Bobwhites at Prairie du Sac were known to have been greatly reduced during the winter of 1928-29. Snow was said to have accumulated to a depth of four feet. Gastrow, before the program was organ- ized, observed a single covey, which shrank from 30 to about six birds. The surviving population of the area was calculated on a 'pro rata basis to be about 22 (33, p. 422), but this figure is no longer thought to be reliable. Lacking area-wide census data, we are entitled to say of the 1928-29 survival only that it may have been as low as at any time in subsequent winters. Starvation and associated losses were locally severe in southern Wisconsin in 1929-30, the first winter of intensive study (18). However, the Prairie du Sac population happened to have been well fed, and a survival figure of 112 of 121 birds, as of April 1, was arrived at (21, p. 112). The winter of 1930-31 was sufficiently open to afford relief from food crises to the bobwhites of the southern Wisconsin observational areas. At Prairie du Sac, the reported survival of 236 of 257 birds (21, p. 112) indicates a loss rate differing little from that of 1929-30. The winter of 1931-32 was similar in open-ness to that of 1930-31 until March. Then, snows brought about widespread deprivation by burying the food left on the ground. The severest emergency losses observed took place in the Wisconsin River bottom- lands southwest of Prairie du Sac. Here, 15 birds survived of a population that totalled 90 at the time of a January census and between 83 and 87 in early February (18, p. 28). On the study area east of Prairie du Sac, a 400-bird population was reduced to 290, but the losses ascribed on fair to excellent evidence to starvation were only in the vicinity of 39 (21, pp. 112-113). As the majority of the coveys had been living with slight loss from any cause for weeks prior to the lethal snowfall (18, pp. 25-27), they would in all likelihood have successfully win- tered except for the emergency. Adding the 39 to the 290, we get 329, representing probable survival under nonemergency conditions. Contrasted with the moderately light emergency losses at Prairie du Sac at the end of the 1931-32 winter, the earlier reduction from 400 to 329 com- prises a substantial nonemergency loss, which for the first time in the Wisconsin investigations, occurred largely through predation upon physically "normal" bobwhites. (For data on the role of horned owls in this reduction, see 24, pp. 247 and 250, and 34, pp. 834-835, family studies 7 and 9.) Bobwhites wintering at Prairie du Sac in 1932-33 were mainly favorably situated with respect to weather and food. A population of 406 was reduced through nonemergency losses to 339 by spring (21, p. 112), or to a level comparable with that surviving in 1931-32 up to the spring crisis. As in 1931-32, the preponderance of the mortality specifically traced was through predation upon apparently "normal" birds (19). Nor were emergency losses considered important at Prairie du Sac in 1933-34, with the possible ex- ception of those attributed indirectly to the debrush- ing of roadsides by relief labor. The debrushing was indeed drastic, and I estimated at the time and</page><page sequence="10">10 PAUL L. ERRINGTON Ecological Monographs Vol. 15, No. 1 on the ground that 30 to 40 birds (the equivalent of two full coveys) had been evicted without the pos- sibility of their finding suitable quarters elsewhere in the area (33, p. 362). This number added to the survival figure of 288 actually recorded for an initial population of 433 would give a nonemergency sur- vival close to that calculated for 1931-32 and to that realized for 1932-33. I now question that the 1933- 34 evictions were quite as lethal as then thought; but whether they were or not, it is apparent that the total nonemergency decline brought the population down to around 300 birds. The winter of 1934-35 was one of weather-linked food shortages. Much habitat was made untenable, and many birds were forced to invade covey ranges already having populations as high as were usually accommodated. A spectacular acceleration of preda- tion-especially by horned owls-followed this mass- ing, but range units not seriously affected by the food shortage wintered about as many birds as in the past, and the predation on these tended to cease with relief from crowding (23, pp. 563-565; 24, pp. 247- 248; 33, pp. 362-364; 34, pp. 800-801 and p. 849, special phase study 13). A total of about 100 birds either left the area or died from starvation and storm. Despite reduction by spring to 196 birds from an initial 411, some 350 got along fairly well during the first half of the winter before the crisis became acute. Nonemergency losses would therefore appear about as substantial as for similar densities during the preceding three winters. We may see that a survival in excess of 300 birds-possibly 330? -could reasonably have been expected had it not been for the emergency conditions. In 1935-36, there was a period of deep snow and some cold weather between late December and the middle of January, but, of an initial 416 birds, a fairly well-established population of at least 329 re- mained by midwinter. This suggests both a non- emergency decline not differing greatly from those of 1931-35 and the prospect of a comparable-300?- spring survival except in the event of lethal emer- gency. The emergency that did come resulted from several weeks of the severest winter weather shown by Weather Bureau records for the region. Blizzard followed blizzard, with prolonged, intense cold and much snow. One after another of the Prairie du Sac coverts was nearly or quite depopulated of bob- whites. By spring, only 70 of the birds were left alive on the area (52, p. 415). Emergency losses in 1935-36 showed some depar- tures from those observed in earlier years (27, 52). Typically, the bobwhites subsist on concentrated foods such as grains and the more nutritious of weed seeds and are unable to endure much fasting. They starve when heavy snowfalls cut off their food sup- ply for a week or more at a stretch. In cold weather, the hunger-weakened are the likeliest to succumb. On rare occasions, sound birds in unsheltered places fall victim to cold, and others are imprisoned to starve or suffocate in hard-packed snowdrifts. In 1935-36, many birds died that should have been in fit enough condition to have endured any of the weather crises between 1929-30 and 1934-35. Throughout the north- central states as well as at Prairie du Sac, bobwhites not only starved in the deep snow or died from the stress of the blizzards but also seemed to be worn down by the sustained cold. Ice storms sealed much of the food supply of north- central bobwhites in 1936-37. By early January, a state of real emergency was manifest. The winter- ing population at Prairie du Sac was cut to 45 from an initial population of 145, a good part of which reduction may be attributed to easily understandable starvation. But the season's temperatures were mild, and, even before the ice storms, a decline of 25 birds had taken place. For the low population density, this was a very high rate of loss during a non- emergency period covering less than half of the winter. Comparison of this early-season with the all-winter losses of 9 of 121 and 21 of 257 in 1929-30 and 1930-31, respectively, entitles one to ask whether the area would have wintered greatly more birds than it actually did in 1936-37 if the winter had been emer- gency-free-possibly about 100 instead of the 450? If such an estimate comes anywhere near the truth- and I regard it as the most defendable one I can make-then the situation in 1936-37 was quite dif- ferent from that in any of the winters 1929-36. The winter of 1936-37 had the only one of three low to moderate populations so far studied at Prairie du Sac that did not appear to be well accommodated under nonemergency conditions, and all of the five populations beginning winters with 400 birds or more either succeeded in wintering about 300 individuals or showed that they could have done so in the ab- sence of emergencies. The winter of 1937-38 was also mild, but a food shortage aggravated by heavy snows in late January was attended by extreme losses. The area's spring level of 39 bobwhites remaining of an initial 163 was the lowest for which we have accurate measure- ment. In contrast with the early, pre-crisis loss of 25 of 145 birds in 1936-37, the 1937-38 population lost only nine before the emergency period-and eight of those were lost in three ranges abandoned in late December and early January. The good sur- vival in the majority of the coveys up to midwinter recalls 1929-31, and it would be easy to believe that, under nonemergency conditions, a much larger pop- ulation than that actually entering the winter could have gotten through with low losses. A 1938-39 decline of 41 from a fall level of 138 was recorded. Sudden losses of 13 birds in Decem- ber and six birds in late winter took place in two border coveys that otherwise lost only two birds, and these 19 were judged simply to have left the area. Even after making allowance for such departure, a mainly nonemergency loss of 22 is still fairly heavy, compared with that for 1929-31 and 1937-38. The second half of 1939-40 began with a heavy snow 'and a minimum temperature of 200 F. below zero. Snow and cold worked in deadly combination</page><page sequence="11">January, 1945 FIFTEEN-YEAR LOCAL STUDY OF THE NORTHERN BOBWHITE 11 for several weeks. Only 133 of an initial 318 bob- whites were reported alive on the area by spring, but 38 of those listed in the decline wintered off the area after leaving in January. The effects of a con- temporaneous crisis on a 4,200-acre area near Ames, Iowa, were personally studied in detail; 46 birds of a late December population of 231 were definitely known to have died, 37 carcasses having been recov- ered from three starving coveys, alone (30). Up to midwinter at Prairie du Sac, most coveys maintained their numbers with little loss from any cause. At least 245 and possibly almost 290 were judged, on the basis of the covey records, to have stood a good chance of surviving had it not been for the emer- gency. In my opinion, the evidence favors the lower of the two figures given above, so perhaps we may suggest a nonemergency survival of about 255. The decline to 142 from 273 birds in 1940-41 must be said to have been in part associated with unfavor- able food conditions in certain covey ranges, although there wasn't much evidence of starvation except in one covey. Field notes described what could be in- terpreted as a generally marginal habitability of occupied quail land, unrest and local massing of birds. Predation losses were unexpectedly severe, and there was decisive evidence of something more than an ordinary emergency. Even if the starved- out covey had survived, the spring population would have been only 159. It does not seem probable that many more than the 142 actually surviving would have survived a nonemergency winter. Save for a blizzard in early January, 1941-42 was mild. Predation again was heavy, and only 122 of an initial population of 264 bobwhites were present in spring. In this instance, emergency losses ac- companying or following the blizzard had a funda- mentally different significance than those characteriz- ing, let us say, 1931-32, when a population had demonstrated its ability to live under nonemergency conditions until spring, finally to show a sharp loss from what almost might be called a freak accident. The February-March population in 1941-42 suffered so much predation during a period of no perceptible emergency that, January blizzard or not, we have no reason to think that the final survival figure would have been much changed if the winter had been en- tirely mild and snowless. For the density involved, this survival is low, indeed, as was the case in 1940-41. The exact nature of the 1942-43 losses is badly obscured by undissociated variables. Some birds starved, but it was clear that outright starvation was not the primary medium of reduction. Live speci- mens handled by Kabat in the course of his banding study were generally in good flesh (unpublished). Heavy predation was noted by Kabat and Gastrow, and much in our interpretation must hinge upon whether that predation was or was not emergency- conditioned. Judging solely from the "paper evi- dence" made available to me, I would say that the losses look like emergency types, regardless of the lack of a wide-spread hunger crisis. Gastrow's jour- nal refers to eight-foot snowdrifts, and Figure 2 shows a January and February depth of snow sur- passed only by the 1935-36 accumulation for those two months. This could very well affect the habita- bility of many coverts. Kabat (letter, Sept. 30, 1943) emphasizes night flushes of roosting bobwhites by red foxes, with in- dividual birds alighting in exposed places to become sluggish from chilling and thus easily preyed upon by many predators. The consequences of such dis- turbances, nevertheless, would be accentuated dur- ing periods of cold and crusted snow (as were amply recorded at Prairie du Sac for January and Feb- ruary). It may be logically contended that even the losses of fox-flushed birds were emergency losses- at any rate to the extent that this type of loss would not be expected to occur during the 1930-31 sort of winter. Moreover, the numbers of bobwhites main- taining themselves fairly well until the January storms suggest that upwards of 275 might have sur- vived a nonemergency winter. Of singular openness until nearly the middle of February, 1943-44 may be classed as a nonemergency winter; nevertheless, of an initial population of 217 bobwhites, only 124 were alive on the area by spring. Predation losses again were heavy, reminding one of the winters of 1940-42. THE THRESHOLD CONCEPT As early as 1933, published reference was made to overpopulation of bobwhite environment at Prairie du Sac, but, to a considerable extent, my concept of overpopulation later proved to be erroneous-espe- cially regarding the simple effects of apparent food and cover deficiencies (18, pp. 24-27). At the end of the fourth winter, the low loss rates for 1929-31 and the similarity of the 1931-33 survivals after initially heavy populations had been cut down through nonemergency losses, in combination with like data from other areas, suggested the operation of thresholds of security, then called "carrying capacity" (21). Except in the event of emergencies, populations living below threshold values wintered with slight reduction through predation and self- adjustment. If exceeding thresholds, populations betrayed instability and pronounced vulnerability to predation until again reduced to secure levels. Thresholds of security, in terms of numbers accom- modated, tended to vary with different areas but to be maintained with reasonable constancy for specific areas, winter after winter. The effect of emergencies was to suspend the operation of thresholds-some- times to the point of making entire populations in- secure-but, within limits, a great deal in the nature of environmental change was known to occur without appreciably modifying threshold values. Observed differences in kinds and numbers of predators and "buffers" seemingly were not reflected in changed security of wintering bobwhites. Data at hand from all north-central sources by the end of the sixth winter chiefly confirmed the trends that were apparent by the end of the fourth and further amplified the threshold concept (33). The</page><page sequence="12">12 PAUL Lj. ERRINGTON Ecological Monographs 12 PAUL L. ERRINGTON ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!, ~~Vol. 15, No. 1 importance of obtaining population figures from complete covey ranges and sizable land units was partly recognized. Distinctions were made between "key" habitats and combinations of food and cover and those having no unique significance despite more or less regular use by bobwhites. Such interpreta- tions of threshold phenomena as were advanced did not ignore psychological factors but emphasized the possibilities of a given threshold being primarily a property of the environment. In retrospect, I think that for many years I was seriously mislead in my attempts to analyze threshold phenomena by the evidences of year-to-year con- stancy in threshold values shown by the eight terri- torial subdivisions mapped for the Prairie du Sac area on pp. 394-395 of the six-year report (33). This apparent constancy for the designated land units continued for at least one winter-1935-36- after my personal participation in the field work had ceased. From then on, the constancy seems largely to have been lost for units much smaller than the total area. It may be said, in short, that former territorial units have been so thoroughly merged and reparti- tioned since 1936-37 that many of their boundaries, as originally observed, have lost all validity, and the question of whether or not subdivisions of the area display year-to-year constancy in threshold values does not currently appear to be of more than very limited significance. Undoubtedly, the entire Prairie du Sac area shows a greater constancy in threshold values than do its constituent parts. THRESHOLD CHANGES From the early winter densities and the calculated nonemergency survivals that are tabulated in Figure 5, it may be judged that about the same basic thresh- old was operative not only for 1931-35, the last four winters for which data were published, but also very probably for 1935-36, the winter of greatest emer- gency, and for the low-density winters of 1929-31. The calculated nonemergency survival of perhaps 100 and the high rate of nonemergency loss for a low-density population in 1936-37 may be construed as reflecting a lowered if not collapsed threshold of security for the area's bobwhites. The possible con- nection between this and periodic depression of other species in the north-central region will be taken up later. The nonemergency loss rate for 1937-38 is so com- parable with those for 1929-31, when initial popula- tions were likewise below 300, that one might well believe the old threshold to have been again operative. For 1938-39, the nonemergency rate is higher than would ordinarily be expected under the old high-a 300 to 330-bird-threshold, but it is not utterly ex- cessive for a high threshold. Security, as from predation, is rarely absolute, and loss rates up to 6% per 90 days have been considered nothing unusual for recognizably secure wintering populations (33, p. 375). As will be brought out, however, the high rate for 1938-39 fits in with other evidence pointing to a suspended or depressed threshold. The 245 to 290 bobwhites calculated to have had a good chance of surviving under nonemergency con- ditions in 1939-40 could be considered evidence for a threshold restored to about the 1931-36 level. A 290 survival would mean a 9% loss, which would fall on the curve outlined by the 1929-36 and 1937-38 data (lower center, Fig. 5). But, objectively regarded, a rionemergency survival closer to 245 than to 290 seems more in keeping with the field evidence. The selected figure of about 255 gives a loss rate of 20%, which is high for the curve, though still seeming to reflect a substantial basic security. Survivals for 1940-42 offered the first really clear challenge to previously held ideas of year-to-year con- stanev in threshold values. Despite the questions as to the degree that the area's threshold was truly suspended or depressed in 1936-37 and the difficulties of appraising the loss rates for 1938-40, the data certainly show that something was different with re- spect to thresholds in 1940-42. Complicated though they are by unknowns, the 1942-43 data revealed far too many bobwhites alive by midwinter to support any thesis to the effect that the poor actual survival merely reflected a contin- uation of the 1940-42 phenomena. In my judgment, the loss rate under nonemergency conditions would have been only a little above the 1929-36 and 1937-38 curve. Lastly, for 1943-44, the status of the area's thresh- old apparently had reverted to about that for 1940-42. From the nonemergency loss rates for 1938-39, 1940-42, and 1943-44, may we suspect the operation of a second basic threshold not much above 100 birds ? Further discussion of threshold phenomena may well be postponed until more evidence has been presented. BOBWHITE SUMMER GAINS LIMITATIONS OF SUMMER DATA It is not implied that the increase of bobwhites on an area from spring to fall is exclusively or even largely the result of breeding of the birds present in the spring or that an individual bobwhite recorded at the time of the last winter or early spring census will necessarily remain on the area to breed. The months from late spring to early fall include, as well as the annual reproductive span of the bobwhite, periods of extensive readjustment in social groups, involving widely separated coverts and areas often to be reckoned in terms of square miles (11; 17; 33, p. 92; 66, pp. 169-182). The quality of data obtained in warm weather studies of north-central bobwhites must be admitted to be greatly inferior to that for the winter records. Evidences of mortality and other "sign" persisted only briefly; visibility was poor in the dense ground cover; and the birds, old and young, were practically impossible to keep track of on a quantitative scale sufficient to permit bonafide week-to-week population studies.

Rates of loss of wintering bobwhites and ring-necked pheasants in relation to density, Prairie du Sac, Wis., 1929-44. years in southern Wisconsin yielded scarcely passable data on nesting losses of bobwhites (20); feeding trends of, and preying upon bobwhites by, certain predators, notably horned owls (34); and fragmen- tary information on mortality and behavior of juve- nile bobwhites. After termination of the all-year field work at Prairie du Sac in 1932, the rate of population gain by fall (checked by general observa- tions in others parts of the region) constituted nearly the sole criterion of reproductive success. Our summer picture is therefore all but lacking in detail, being represented rather literally by not much except the frame. But the spring and fall census data comprising the frame are of good quality and, whatever else may be said of them, afford us some- thing definite enough to grasp. Considering nothing except the census data as they have come to hand, year after year, we are not obliged to make any assumptions whatever as to what the area's bobwhites did or did not do in the intervening months. The data are legitimately usable for analytical purposes to the extent that they show significant trends. INVERSE RATIOS IN RATES or GAIN Summer gains, as shown by numerical differences between spring and fall populations in Figure 4, look highly variable; but, as plotted in percentages in the upper left of Figure 6, they reveal certain patterns. By the fall of 1932, it had been noted that summer gains tended to be in inverse ratio to spring densities (21, pp. 124-125), and this inverse relationship was better defined by the fall of 1935 (33, p. 422). At the time of this writing (spring, 1944), the percent- ages of gain in relation to spring densities for 13 of 14 summers at Prairie du Sac fall pretty well in two curves. The principal curve, defined by the rates of gain for eight of the 14 summers (1931-35, 1937, 1939, and 1942) is a reverse sigmoid, and, as long as spring to fall rates of gain in bobwhite numbers conform to it, the fall populations should be fairly well pre- dictable from spring densities even before the start of actual breeding. For such years, we may ordinarily expect Prairie du Sac spring densities of about 40 birds to be fol- lowed by fall densities of about 140; spring densities of about 100, by fall densities of about 325; spring densities of about 200, by fall densities of about 400; spring densities approaching 340, by fall densities approaching 440. Stated otherwise, if the fall pop- ulations with which we are here concerned were made up only of evenly paired spring residents and their progeny-which, of course, we know is not true-the average numbers of young raised by fall per pair would be about five from a 20-pair spring level; more than four young from a 50-pair level; about two young from a 100-pair level; and not much more than one-half young from the highest observed level of about 170 pairs.

So far as it goes, it seems to reflect inverse ratios to spring densities somewhat after the manner of the first curve though on a different level of increase. Conformation of 13 of the 14 rates of summer gain at Prairie du Sac to one or the other of two density- determined patterns has not been noticeably influ- enced by emergencies. In southern Iowa, a drought occurred in 1934 that was of such intensity and long duration that it virtually brought about desert con- ditions in local areas, and this was accompanied by summer declines in bobwhite populations (22). In other parts of the north-central bobwhite range ob- served during the summer and fall of that year, in- cluding southern Wisconsin, the drought seemed less severe than in southern Iowa and more within the toleration limits of the species. The drought summer of 1936 was one of decidedly low rates of gain in relation to spring densities at Prairie du Sac as well as elsewhere in the region, but, as will be shown, drought would appear to have figured less importantly than what we, for want of understanding and a better term, must still call periodic depression. THE QUESTION OF PHASE-LINKAGE BETWEEN RATES OF SUMMER GAIN AND NONEMERGENCY WINTER LOSSES Let us again look at the rates of nonemergency winter losses and rates of summer gains of the Prairie du Sac bobwhites in the lower center of Fig- ure 5 and the upper left of Figure 6. First, it may be perceived that, for the density levels involved, the lowest rate of summer gain-that of 1936-was followed by the highest calculated rate of nonemergency winter loss. Then, three summers -1940, 1941, and 1943-of gains depressed below the main eight-summer curve were followed by dis- tinctly high rates of nonemergency winter loss. A similar thing seemed to have occurred in 1938, but the densities concerned were sufficiently low to make departures from the "normal" gain and loss curves hard to judge. The slightly elevated (compared with the curve for 1929-36 and 1937-38) rates of nonemergency loss cal- culated for the winters of 1939-40 and 1942-43 do not follow summers for which rates of gain were de- pressed below the main curve. They do precede summers of depressed gains. Of all of the data points falling outside of the two "normal" curves for rates of nonemergency win- ter loss and summer gain, that representing summer gain for 1930 is the only one standing by itself. More groundwork will have to be laid before treat- ment of the present subject may be advantageously concluded in this paper. Meanwhile, the reader may be left with the thought that rates of summer gain and nonemergency winter loss perhaps do run in some sort of phase. INFLUENCE OF CHANGES IN SO-CALLED LIMITING FACTORS ON THE POPULA- TION STATUS OF THE PRAIRIE DU SAC BOBWHITES The "limiting factors" listed in publications on the natural history, ecology, or management of a wild animal usually include extremes of weather; avail- ability of food, cover, and water; various aspects of predation (or of parasitism) ; and competitive rela- tionships. Much of the treatment of these factors in the literature is extremely hard to appraise, and a reader may have justifiable doubts as to what is desirably standardized or merely stereotyped, whether an au- thor's statements reflect critical thinking or indoc- trination, self-acquired or otherwise. Acknowledgment of some of these deficiencies in my own past writings should not make it less in order for me here to re- view the question of what really did limit bobwhite populations at Prairie du Sac. WEATHER AND ENVIRONMENT There can be no doubt that weather emergencies (notably those manifested by winter starvation) may have influence on population levels of the bobwhite in northern parts of its geographic range. These emergencies, however, show much variability, both in severity and time of onset. Their eff ects upon local bobwhites do not correspond closely to any natural rhythm that I can detect. The possible influence of year-to-year variations in food, cover, and water on the Prairie du Sac bob-</page><page sequence="15">January, 1945 FIFTEEN-YEAR LOCAL STUDY OF THE NORTHERN BOBWHITE 15 whites has received a vast amount of attention with- out yielding much except negative information. Un- questionably, environmental changes have resulted from land-use practices in the course of the 15-year study, and we should not lose sight of the cover deterioration previously mentioned to have been noted by Leopold and Kabat. For all of the local consequences of roadside de- brushing, burning, fall plowing, removal of corn shocks, etc., recorded during investigations of the northern bobwhite, I do not think that the depressed rates of summer gain and the depressed winter thresholds at Prairie du Sac since 1936 may correctly be laid to environmental impoverishment. The drought of 1936 had its effects on food and ground cover, but, from a short visit made in early winter 1936-37, I would say that conditions did not look appreciably worse than they had in 1931, when rates of summer gain and nonemergency winter loss had followed the patterns defined by the curves for the "normal" years. The 1940-44 data might be con- strued as reflecting general deterioration of the phys- ical environment were it not for contrary evidence furnished by the summer gain for 1942 and the win- ter survival up to the beginning of the storm period in January, 1943. And the somewhat depressed rate of summer gain for 1938 and the elevated rate of nonemergency winter loss for 1938-39-coming as they did between the "normal" gains and losses of the summer of 1937, the winter of 1937-38, and the summer of 1939-do not look like early evidence of any permanent change in basic habitability of the Prairie du Sac environment. Before we here strain to reconcile what is not necessarily reconcilable, let us consider some other things. PREDATORS AND "BUFFERS" The reader, checking back on Table 1, will find no figures on predator densities for 1929-30, for the rea- son that predators were not then studied on all of what was later established as the Prairie du Sac ob- servational area. For the central three square miles, on which most of the work was done in 1929-30, the regularly active predators, "as nearly as could be de- termined, were one or two horned owls, at least one barred owl, several screech owls, 3 redtails, and a rather sparse population of grey foxes and weasels" (18, p. 22). This suggests that the whole area had, except for fewer foxes and more small owls, a pred- ator population in that winter not differing greatly from that of 1930-31. Practically any species of raptorial bird and car- nivorous mammal listed in this paper may be ex- pected to do more or less preying upon the bobwhite under conditions favoring predation. Of all of these, the horned owl, Cooper's hawk, house cat, and the two foxes were the species to which by far the greater proportion of the actual killing must be charged- to the horned owl possibly more than to all of the others together (24, p. 245). The striped skunk is well known as an egg-eater, and foxes and cats would be likely predators upon incubating and imma- ture bobwhites. Among the rodents, the ground squirrels, from studies elsewhere (45), may be re- garded with suspicion as enemies of eggs and young. In view of the numerically undetermined, but not noticeably changing, year-to-year status of house cats and ground squirrels, and the irregularity with which Cooper's hawks visited or lived in the area, one prob- lem is to find whether there is a correlation between basic population phenomena of the Prairie du Sac bobwhites and changes in densities of the local horned owls, foxes, and skunks. Another is the possibility of fluctuations in "buf- fer" populations influencing the status of the bob- whites. Cottontails and meadow mice were the most important "buffers" showing pronounced changes in numbers. The lightness of the nonemergency loss rate for the winter of 1929-30 might at first glance look con- sistent with conventional views on bobwhite-predator- "buffer" relationships. The predator population was rather low, the meadow mouse population was high, and the cottontail population was about "average." But the 1930-31 rate for a higher bobwhite pop- ulation was nearly the same as in 1929-30. Though the horned owl and cottontail populations were evi- dently similar in 1930-31 to what they had been in 1929-30, the meadow mouse "peak" had collapsed months before the winter of 1930-31, and the gray fox population had risen to a moderate level by 1930-31. Cooper's hawks in 1930-31 were unusually persistent in their harassment of bobwhite coveys (18, pp. 22-24). In 1931-32 and 1932-33, we see similar rates of nonemergency winter losses from similar bobwhite densities. The populations of horned owls and cot- tontails were also similar, but those of gray foxes and meadow mice were higher in 1932-33 than in 1931-32. A higher initial density of bobwhites suffered a higher rate of nonemergency loss in 1933-34. The winter was one of fewer horned owls and gray foxes than 1932-33, about the same density of cottontails, and a population of meadow mice apparently ap- proaching another peak. Nonemergency losses of bobwhites were evidently nearly as great in the winters of 1934-35 and 1935-36 as in 1933-34, from nearly as high initial densities. The horned owl populations for 1934-36 were the largest thus far recorded, being almost twice as high as in 1933-34. Gray fox densities were somewhat higher than in 1933-34; there was no known pro- nounced change in the cottontails; and meadow mice may have reached a peak in 1934 and fallen off later. A brief visitation by goshawks was not known to have changed any trends in the bobwhite data. Now we come to the sharply increased loss rate for 1936-37, for a low-density bobwhite population. The horned owl population was lower than in 1934- 36, and the adults had no young in nests by late winter and spring. Gray foxes had virtually reached</page><page sequence="16">16 PAUL L. ERRINGTON Ecologicai Monographs Vo.15, No. 1 their highest level for the area. Cottonta Is obviously had declined and meadow mice were probably present in moderate numbers, being on the way to their next abundance peak in 1938. For all of the nonbreeding of the horned owls, it might be argued that the predator population of 1936-37 was still high enough with respect to avail- able "buffers" to be forced more to seek other prey, such as bobwhites; but, in 1937-38, when cottontails were still low (though meadow mice were nearing another peak), another very high gray fox popula- tion and a horned owl population once again "nor- mal" took only about the same relative toll as much smaller numbers of predators having much more available food had taken from the lowver bobwhite population of 1929-30. The winter of 1938-39, when the nonemergency loss rate for bobwhites was rather high for their density level, was one of meadow mouse abundance and "nor- mal" numbers of cottontails and of what might be called an ordinary horned owl population. It was also marked by sharply lowered gray fox densities and by the largest number of red foxes observed on the area in the course of the study up to that time. Despite lack of certainty as to the numerical value of the nonemergeney loss for the winter of 1939-40, my feeling is that it was fairly high for the initial population level of the bobwhites. This, however, is correlated with no differences in numbers of predators or buffers that I can see. It is true that meadow mice had presumably declined following their 1938 peak, but cottontails were again "normal" and about to begin an ascendancy. Horned owls and both spe- cies of foxes were less numerous than they had been the previous winter. The winters of 1940-41 and 1941-42, with their similar, moderate-density populations of bobwhites, showed high rates of nonemergeney losses. Cotton- tails were exceedingly abundant both in 1940-41 and 1941-42, and meadow mice again reached peak num- bers in 1942. The 1940-41 population of horned owls was the heaviest of the entire period of study and, in 1941-42, it was still as high as it had been in the previous winters of abundance, 1934-36. Gray fox densities were about the same in 1940-41 as in 1939-40, but this species had almost disappeared from the area by 1941-42. Red fox densities re- mained about the same in 1940-41 and 1941-42. The predator-prey picture for 1940-41 shows a generally higher level of bobwhite enemies and a lower level of "buffers" than for 1941-42, yet the rate of preda- tion upon similar densities of bobwhites was, if any- thing, higher in 1941-42. Regardless of questions remaining unsettled as to how much the severe wintering losses for 1942-43 were emergency or nonemergeney in type, we know that there was a great deal of predation upon a fairly heavy bobwhite population. The meadow mouse population was high, as was that of cotton- tails, though the latter were not as abundant as they had been in the preceding two winters. Horned owls were present in "average" numbers; gray foxes were barely represented; and red foxes were more abundant than in any previous year of the program. The association of red fox activities emphasized by Kabat might very well represent an intensification of predator pressure of a sort not observed in earlier years. On the other hand, the night flushing by gray foxes described (iS, p. 28) for 1931-32-one of the winters of heavy bobwhite densities and high non- emergency survival-would not appear so dissimilar to that of the reds in 1942-43. The winter of 1943-44 was remarkable for its fox densities. Grays were back about to their 1938-39 level, and the numbers of reds actually killed during the winter surpassed all records for anv area of like size of which I know. It seems within reason that upwards of 40 foxes may have ranged over some part of the 4,500-acre tract during particular nights. Horned owls, too, were abundant, as were miscel- laneous carnivores. Cottontails and meadow mice had decreased, which, with the above, would appear ideally to fulfill the conventionally accepted require- ments for heavy bobwhite losses from predation. Heavy predation in fact took place, and the possi- bility is not disproved that so many active and hun- gry flesh-eaters, by their predacious weight alone, may have forced the wintering population of bob- whites below otherwise operative thresholds of secur- ity. Nevertheless, the resemblance of the 1943-44 losses to those of 1940-42 is too great to make wholly convincing any sweeping explanations in terms of in- creased populations of predators and decreased popu- lations of "buffers." Rates of gain of the Prairie du Sac bobwhites con- formed to the "normal" curve for eight of 14 sum- mers, despite some quite pronounced differences in status of skunks and foxes, as well as of other pred- ators. Of these "conforming" summers, 1937 was one of high skunk densities, and the summers of 1931 to 1935 and that of 1937 evidently had substan- tial to very high densities of gray foxes. Meadow mouse populations were low about 1935 and 1939 and cottontails were still low in 1937. The predator and "buffer" populations were probably as much out of theoretical balance in 1937 as in any summer of "normal" bobwhite recovery at Prairie du Sac. In 1936, the year of most severely depressed sum- mer gains for bobwhites, Prairie du Sac skunks were less abundant than in "normal" 1937; gray foxes were at a high level in 1936 but no higher than in 1937; "buffers" admittedly were present in diminished num- bers in 1936, but their status by 1937 can hardly be thought to have improved so much as to explain the differences between the bobwhite gains of the two summers. There is likewise nothing about the known pred- ator and "buffer" situations for 1940 and 1941 to suggest a connection with the depressed gains of the bobwhites. Skunks were abundant in 1941 (about as in "normal" 1937); gray foxes were low in 1940 and still lower in 1941; red foxes were fairly numer- ous in 1940 and 1941, yet were more abundant in 1942, a year of "normal" bobwhite gain.</page><page sequence="17">January, 1945 FIFTEEN-YEAR LOCAL STUDY OF THE NORTHERN BOBWHITE 17 If we may judge from the fall and early winter densities, the skunks and the gray and red foxes collectively must have reached, in the summer of 1943, their greatest abundance during the Prairie du Sac studies. At the same time, "buffer" densities were at least fairly low. The depressed rate of gain of the bobwhites for this year may be said to coincide with a state of predator-prey unbalance, but the un- balance does not look any worse than it did for "nor- mal" 1937. Even if the predators did depress the bobwhite gain for 1943, the rate does not fall much short of the "normal" curve. More likely, in my estimation, the rate of gain simply conformed to the second curve, that already outlined by the gains for 1930, 1938, and 1940-41. The lack of connection between rates of nonemer- gency winter loss and summer gain and observed differences in populations of predators and "buffers" has seemed to hold pretty well for areas other than Prairie du Sac in the north-central region (29, 33). It denotes much variability in details of mortality, reproduction, and movement of the bobwhites being cancelled out in net effect by the bobwhite's own density factor, in particular. Many of the supposed advantages of favorable breeding seasons or decreased losses from enemies fail to count in the end, as do, in their turn, many of the disadvantages of unfavorable breeding seasons or of increased losses from enemies. Thus are exemplified the intercompensatory trends in population phenomena of higher vertebrates that have been becoming more and more apparent (31, 32). How widely they apply to the higher verte- brates generally or even to bobwhites over the occu- pied range of that species is quite undetermined. Less flexibility in bobwhite-predator-"buffer" rela- tionships may exist in southeastern United States, where fewer alternatives of action seem to be open to predators at times of failure of their main staple food, the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) (35). Known losses of free-living bobwhites from para- sites and diseases at Prairie du Sac and elsewhere in the region have been so negligible, and the refer- ences to them so scattered in the literature, that the subject mav here be dismissed with little additional comment. Let it only be pointed out that ordinary variations in losses through these agencies could be expected to fall into intercompensatory categories and to tend to be counterbalanced, when relatively high, by lowered losses through other agencies, and rice rersa. A sweepingly lethal epizootic, if one oc- curred, would be another thing, logically classifiable as an emergency type of destruction, along with those resulting from hunger crises and storms. COMPETITIVE GALLIFORMES It has long been clear that the density factor had a very important role in governing population phe- nomena of the northern bobwhite. But how broad should be our concept of density factor ?-relating to bobwhites 'alone or to bobwhites plus what else? The Prairie du Sac bobwhites could hardlv have been subject to severely effective interspecific com- petition from wild animals or the basic patterns in their rates of gain and nonemergency loss would not have been so well maintained. This does not prove, however, that the patterns were totally uninfluenced by interspecific competition. Among the faunal groups sharing the bobwhite's geographic range in the north-central region, other wild Galliformes might on general grounds be sus- pected of being the closest competitors. These in- clude the native grouse and certain introduced game birds. Existing information does not tell us much about interspecific competition in native Galliformes. - It seems rather to be expected that such competition might, after a long span of racial adjustment, show less pronounced aspects than competition between native and recently introduced species having over- lapping local ranges or territories. We have in native Galliformes, prairie chickens and sharp-tailed grouse (Pediocetes phasianellus) replacing one an- other in central Wisconsin counties as land is placed under cultivation or reverts, and further possible competitive relations between sharp-tails and ruffed grouse as reversion of former agricultural lands may progress; but the picture is so dominated by plant succession as to make interspecific relations of these grouse seem quite secondary (40). It should not be thought that significant competi- tion, when occurring, must conform to popular ideas of one species eating the other's food, destroying the other's eggs or young, or driving out the other by attack. Ruffed grouse were not regarded as real competi- tors of the bobwhites at Prairie du Sac. During most years, at any rate, the grouse were fairly well segre- gated in types of habitat rarely visited by bobwhites. During the years of unusually high grouse popula- tions, 1941-44 (see lower Figure 12), the grouse appeared in, and disappeared from, places in which they hadn't been seen for many years; and one would think that, if they had depressive influence on the bobwhites, it would have been at that time.; How- ever, the summer of probably the highest actual grouse density, 1942, was one for which the rate of gain of the bobwhite fell very close to the line for the "normal" curve (Figure 6, upper left). Figure 7 presents largely unpublished data on bob- white and prairie chicken populations of an area near Hunt City, Ill., furnished through the courtesy of Dr. R. E. Yeatter of the Illinois State Natural His- tory Survey. Considering the bobwhite data alone, we may see rates of summer gain that are depressed in 1936 and 1937 but otherwise show what looks like typical in- verse ratios. Whatever may be the meaning of the irregularities of the prairie chicken gains, if the prairie chickens and bobwhites were mutual depres- sants, the latter species surely did not find itself at any overwhelming disadvantages as long as its own gains reflected primarily its own densities rather than those of the chickens, even for the-summer of 1939</page><page sequence="18">18 PAUL L.

The two winters of heaviest den- sities of chickens-1938-39 and 1941-42-were win- ters of substantial reduction of bobwhites, but the survivals of 95 and 110 birds of the latter species are sufficiently close to the estimated threshold to argue against very much depression resulting from the presence of the chickens. Preliminary to our consideration of competition between the bobwhite and the introduced ring-necked pheasant at Prairie du Sac, it may be explained that the evidence from eleswhere in the north-central region indicates that wintering bobwhites avoid cov- erts having many pheasants much as they do places overpopulated with their own kind. Thresholds of security tend to retain their numerical uniformity for given areas but the thresholds apply to mixed populations of bobwhites and pheasants rather than to bobwhites, alone (29, pp. 96-97). The end result of this sort of competition may then be, within lim- its, the exotic pheasants wintering at the expense of the native bobwhites, essentially bird for bird. Especially because of the greater mobility and irreg- ularity in habits of the pheasants, the density figures in my possession may often be only approximate or may be accurate only for certain times of the win- ter, thus necessitating careful estimating for other times. Passably satisfactory data on cold weather pheasant densities are at hand for two long-studied areas besides Prairie du Sac that have mixed bob- white and pheasant populations (Figures 8 and 9). Unfortunately, for both areas, there are too many undissociated variables in the winter losses of the bobwhites themselves to justify attempts to plot non- emergency loss rates. The analytical importance of reasonably accurate dissociation is well illustrated by the lower left of Figure 5, in which gross winter loss rates at Prairie du Sac give more of the appearance of a buckshot target than of any meaningful curves. 40 -fl93 8 Weld Goldifor s noot | "~~~~~~~~~~~0 -gs.

The 1500-acre area has been described in the literature as two areas, but, for pur- poses of this paper, these may be regarded as a unit. For Prairie du Sac, the nonemergency losses of bobwhites plus pheasant losses define, in combination, smoother curves than do rates of nonemergency losses of bobwhites, alone (lower right, Figure 5). In the latter, the nonemergency loss rate begin- ning in the fall of 1936 still remains high for the total population of bobwhites and pheasants; but its actual numerical value is sufficiently uncertain so that we cannot be absolutely sure that it does not have affinities with the 1938-1940-1941-1943 group, which seems to define a part near the upper asymptote of a sigmoid curve. The curve defined by the nonemer- gency loss rates beginning in the "normal" falls of 1929-35 and 1937 also would seem to define, for one thing, part of a sigmoid, only in this case a lower asymptote.

Data, furnished by Depart- ment of Wildlife Management, University of Wisconsin. other (compare lower left, Figure 8, with upper left and left center). The loss for 1936 and the strongly depressed rate for 1937 are thought to have periodic connection. These exceptions notwithstanding, the alignment of the percentages of summer gain (or loss) leaves an impression of agreement with the principle of inverse ratios and of a substantial degree of mutual depression. The Faville Grove data (Figure 9) were variously arrived at and those for pheasants are considered the weakest, insofar as censuses of these birds were made in January of each year. Professor Leopold, from data available, worked out a rule of thumb method for calculating spring densities, 1937-41, on the basis of a 15% late winter loss plus a gain of 25% of the birds artificially stocked in midwinter. Fall densities were calculated by adding to the Jan- uary censuses the shooting kills of the preceding f alls. Releases of artificially propagated 8-weeks pheasants in August were disregarded. Several dis- crepancies between the data of Figure 9 and those given by Hawkins (44, pp. 45-49) fbor the area may be laid to errors missed in proofreading the -earlier publication. The known changes in the waning remnant of prai- rie chickens at Faville Grove, spring to f all, were slight in terms of numbers of individuals except in 1938 (tabulated data, right center of Figure 9). Moreover, the population was believed to be virtually without competitive influence on the other resident Galliformes. For these reasons, the curve outlined by the rates of gain or loss of the wild Galliformes, collectively, may be considered more truly informative with the chicken data omitted. From Figure 9, it is apparent that the curve for the bobwhite-partridge-pheasant combination shows clearer conformity to the principle of inverse ratios than do the curves for any one of these species plotted separately. Turning again to Figure 6, we see, lower left, that rates of gain for the Prairie du Sac bobwhites and pheasants, collectively, line up better along the main curve, and seemingly along the other one as well, than do the rates for the bobwhite, alone. It would there- fore seem that even very low densities of pheasants have their competitive significance to the bobwhite. THE DENSITY FACTOR Nearly a quarter-century ago, Pearl and Parker, from experimental data on both vetebrates and inver- tebrates, stated (64, p. 217): "In general there can be no doubt that this whole matter of influence of den- sity of population, in all senses, upon biological phenomena, deserves a great deal more investigation than it has had. The indications are that it is the most significant element in the biological, as distin- guished from the physical, environment of organisms." To me, the conclusion seems inescapable that much may happen in the ecology of the bobwhite without visibly affecting population trends and that much may be superimposed upon basic natural rhythms, or, shall we say, upon biological undercurrents that are neither easily deflected nor changed in pace. The thresholds of security and the inverse ratios re- vealed by the Prairie du Sac data-and similarly though less completely and less clearly by data from other north-central areas-may be considered mani- festations of such undercurrents. The observed interchangeability in density equa- tions of the bobwhites and certain of their exotic relatives, on a bird for bird basis, provides some clues as to how density may work as a limiting factor. If we regard the Prairie du Sac pheasants, in a space-competitive sense, as extra bobwhites, we see accentuated the trends that were already well defined by the bobwhite data, alone. We may not assume that pheasants, alone, would respond wholly in the same way. Indeed, we may be sure that they would not, for, in other parts of the region, they have displayed vastly more tolerance of crowding than have the bobwhites, sometimes mass- ing locally by hundreds or thousands (29, pp. 96- 98). In addition, the pheasants may not be as characteristically sensitive to "undercurrent" influ- ences as the bobwhites. Neither the Ames nor the Faville Grove pheasants (left center, Figure 8, and lower left center, Figure 9) responded during the depressions of 1936 and 1937 in a way comparable to the apparent responses of the bobwhites. It would seem that the rates of gain and loss of the pheasants, while doubtless not divorced from all</page><page sequence="20">20 PAUL . ERRINGTON Ecological Monographs PAUL L. ERRINGTON ~~~~~~~~Vol. 15, No.I rules of order and automatic adjustment, were sub- ject to considerable variation and that the conforma- tion of rates of gain and loss of mixed populations of bobwhites and pheasants to the patterns shown by the Prairie du Sac data (lower right, Figure 5, and lower left, Figure 6) reflected population phe- nomena that were primarily those of the bobwhites. As the fortunes of the pheasants varied, adjustments in rates of gain and loss of the bobwhites tended to take place accordingly, within the framework set by the bobwhite's own limiting mechanisms. It would be very easy to get out of our depth philosophically in attempting to consider the role of psychology in self-limiting mechanisms of the bob- white. In another paper (29, pp. 98-100), I intro- duced the thought that much of the year-to-year con- stancy to be noted in threshold values, etc., might be explainable in terms of toleration "traditions" (no anthropomorphic connotations intended) on the part of dominant individuals. All of the evidence of which I know continues to support the "tradition" concept and no evidence impresses me as being con- trary to it; however, the subject may here be dropped without further comment for the reason that the "traditions," if truly existent and significant, now would seem to affect merely the local distribution and behavior of the birds rather than the status of the species over large areas. Over the larger areas, populations have a way of following basic patterns, irrespective of many differences that are apparent on a more local scale. We may ask how much the manifestations of basic patterns of loss and gain that we have before us only hint of MeAtee's (55, p. 144) thesis that predation collectively tends to be in proportion to population, later restated by him (56, pp. 125-126) to the effect that the proportion rises and falls progressively with increase or decrease in numbers of the available food organisms ? Granted that the losses classed in this paper as nonemergency in type are not due exclusively to predation, how strictly are they in their totality a function of density? Predation and other nonemergency losses suffered by bobwhite populations (or by mixed bobwhites and pheasants) in excess of thresholds at Prairie du Sac are characterized by elimination of birds above threshold levels and by relative safety of unhandi- capped birds living below thresholds. Nicholson's (61, p. 171) comparison of territory-holding birds with water in an overflowing reservoir is descriptive, with overflow birds like overflow water comprising the part of the whole that is lost. The threshold type of predation has been consid- ered a modification of the proportional predation type (21). As populations exceed thresholds, they are preyed upon more and more in proportion to numbers, but the populations wintering securely be- low threshold levels (sometimes with absolutely no loss for months at a time) certainly are not preyed upon proportionally. Theoretically, one might expect, because of dif- ferences in ability of mature birds in regular resi- dence and the not so well established young to take care of themselves, that summer loss rates should be more in proportion to numbers than nonemergency winter loss rates. Of course, we would be in a better position to inquire into the role of density in determining sum- mer loss rates of bobwhites if we knew more about bobwhite and pheasant densities-of young birds and old-during summer and early fall of each year. In view of the scantiness of existing data, the best we can hope to do is to keep within the limits set by the actual figures for spring and late fall (or early winter) densities and to attempt some compu- tation of densities and loss rates for the intervening periods on the most reliable prorata bases that we can find-without, however, losing sight of the essen- tial unreliability of prorata computations treating with population trends that are marked by much automatic adjustment (31). The summer of 1931 not only represented, in terms of bobwhite densities, weather, etc., about an "aver- age" summer at Prairie du Sac, but also was the one of most concerted field studies of bobwhite reproduc- tion carried on during the entire program of work in southern Wisconsin and central Iowa. Data gathered mainly during this summer and mainly from the neighborhood of Prairie du Sac gave the following statistics: bobwhite hens successful in bringing off broods, about 80% (not, to be confused with percentage of nests succeeding); young hatched, 13.6 per successful hen; young alive by midsummer, about 70% of those hatched; adults alive by mid- summer, about 90% of the spring population. A sex tally of mature bobwhites gave 42.3% hens. Using these values, we get a midsummer density 4.1 times as great as the spring density. Let us try the latter as a constant in computing midsummer bobwhite densities for different years at Prairie du Sac. We need not really assume, knowing the extreme unlikeliness thereof, that the breeding population for each summer consisted of the iden- tical birds present in spring or even of substantially the same number. Nor need we really assume any year-to-year constancy in adult sex ratios, percent- ages of hens successful in hatching young, sizes of broods hatched out, mortality rates of adults or young at given seasons, or of other things that we know are actually quite variable. Knowing the great amount of counterbalancing that occurs, we can ex- pect "good" nesting seasons accompanied by little loss of clutches from enemies, weather, accidents, and miscellaneous disturbances to mean early termination of nesting activities and a high "reproductive effi- ciency." Conversely, during a season of unusual dis- turbances, we can expect the total number of eggs laid to become greater because of stimulation of in- creased nesting by abandonment or destruction of clutches, thus resulting in a poorer "reproductive efficiency," though not necessarily in much if any diminution in total numbers of young ultimately hatched during a season (31). And because of the</page><page sequence="21">January, 1945 FIFTEEN-YEAR LOCAL STUDY OF THE NORTHERN BOBWHITE 21 stringing out of the nesting season of southern Wis- consin bobwhites from May to September, we also know that the earlier of a season's young suffer mor- tality months before the later ones hatch. Let us nevertheless see what we would get if we ignored these variables and went ahead with our computations. C.oI-totin of opp-oi-ot.

Computed loss rates of bobwhites in relation to density, Prairie. du Sac, Wis., midsummer to early wninter, 1930-43. Values obtained through computations should be considered with reservations, as indicated in text. In Figure 10 are plotted, with reference to known and computed densities at Prairie du Sac, the com- puted loss rates, midsummer to early winter. The length of the period to which the loss rates apply is intended to be about the same as that used in plotting the winter losses of Figure 5, or approximately four and one half months. Even while keeping in mind all appropriate reser- vations, we may be confident that shortcomings of the prorata computations were not the main cause of loss rates in Figure 10 failing to occur in anything resembling straight -proportions to density. Be it conceded that the rate for 1936 might reflect some- thing close to proportional losses, the rates for at least 1930 and 1940-41 are patently lower in propor- tion to numbers involved; those for at least the 1931-35 span, still lower. All of the computed loss rates between 45% and 69% are for computed mid- summer densities ranging from 287 to 1,390 birds. In looking over the rates of nonemergency winter losses and of summer gains plotted in Figures 5 and 6, we may see that the two major curves defined by the data points in each case, density-linked though they are, assuredly are the product of more than densitv. There are at least two phases of density response, one shifting into the other and out again, to be traced through Figures 5 and 6. The one that we may call the "normal" or "phase I," defined by the win- ters of 1929-36 and 1937-38 and the summers of 1931-35, 1937, 1939, and 1942, if not by the winters of 1939-40 and 1942-43, clearly is not due to the same function of density as is the phase of depressed winter thresholds and summer gains that we may call "phase JJ"-the winters of 1938-39, 1940-42, 1943-44, and the summers of 1930, 1938, 1940-41, and 1943. The summer of 1936 and the following winter, which, at Prairie du Sac, show the lowest rates of summer gain and the highest rates of nonemergency winter loss in relation to density, may conceivably represent a third phase. SYNCHRONY AND PERIODICITY SHOWN BY DEPRESSION PHASES OF HIGHER VER- TEBRATES IN NORTH-CENTRAL UNITED STATES The literature on periodic cycles is tremendous, includes much pioneering and obsolete work and much that, because of deficiencies in my own knowl- edge, I find unappraisable. It relates chiefly to spe- cies other than the bobwhite indeed, the bobwhite is often regarded as noncyclic, doubtfully cyclic, or only slightly cyclic on the basis of the evidence shown by gross fluctuations. Gross fluctuations are probably as important a cause of dissension on this subject as any single thing. Kendeigh's (47, p. 4) bobwhite curve for Ohio, 1908-31, and Leopold's (50, p. 142) curve for the frankly cyclic ruffed grouse in Wisconsin for the same period have broadly synchronous declines and ascendancies. On the other hand, the bobwhite over its range as a whole is referred to as a species w ith a flat population curve (51, p. 70). Further, the gross fluctuations of both grouse and bobwhite may vary, for example, according to geography (51, pp. 59-71). In my opinion, it is all but hopeless to try to gain an accurate idea of possible periodicity solely or even mainly by consideration of gross fluctuations of a species as susceptible to emergency depression as the bobwhite in north-central United States and it, therefore, behooves us to seek other common denominators. No attempt will be made to undertake a general treatment of animal cycles in this paper. And al- though evidence from other species will be freely used, the primary objective of this section will still be to aid in the exploration of population phenom- ena of the bobwhite. In laying the groundwork for this and other writ- ings, I have searched through literature and unpub- lished notes, alike, for numerical data on rates of increase of vertebrates on definite areas of land over periods covering two or more breeding seasons. Small to medium-sized mammals and birds, espe- cially the more prolific, seem to show a quite pro- nounced tendency to increase in numbers, spring to</page><page sequence="22">22 PAUL L.

King. fall, in inverse ratio to their spring densities. They also show "off points" suggesting affinities with the phases noted for the Prairie du Sac bobwhites and possibly other phase effects. The classic examples of periodically cyclic species, the ruffed grouse and snowshoe hare (Lepus ameri- canms), are hardy northern wilderness forms ordi- narily having access to an abundance of staple food in the most habitable parts of their geographic ranges. They are not completely unaffected by emer- gency factors, such as extremes of weather, but their susceptibility certainly is much less than that of the granivorous bobwhite in the north-central states. If gross fluctuations of any species truly reflect cyclic behavior, they should be those of the ruffed grouse and snowshoe hare in characteristic environment. Figure 11 was prepared from King's (49, p. 529) data on ruffed grouse of an area in north-central Minnesota during a period of cyclic ascendancy and decline. It may be seen that during the recorded ascendancy-spring, 1930, through winter, 1933-34- the summer gains (upper right) showed broadly in- verse ratios and the winter losses (left center) showed threshold phenomena. Both curves resembled those of phase I for the Prairie du Sac bobwhites. The summer loss rates for 1930-31 were greater than one might have expected for the moderate densities in- volved, so we may consider the possibility that the grouse were still in a somewhat depressed phase dur- ing the first two years of the census records. This thought is supported by the facts that the 1930-31 rates of gain look a little lower in relation to April densities than do those for 1931-33, and that the rates of winter loss, 1930-32, look a little high-at least, they do not reflect the degree of security that non- emergency losses of northern bobwhites typically do at subthreshold levels. The collapse of the popula- tion seems to have begun in the summer of 1934 and swiftly gained momentum. The lowest densities and the severest rates of loss recorded were reached in 1936, at the depth of the cycle or very close to it. Fisher's published data on ruffed grouse in Mich- igan are presented collectively in Figure 12 for all long-studied areas from which census figures were taken by means of his preferred Method II (37, pp. 11-12). The data points in the upper left show progressively depressed rates of summer gain for the spring densities involved as the cyclic decline approached its culmination, which seemed to have been in 1936. The data from the New York studies on the Con- necticut Hill area reported by Edminster (12, p. 826- corrections made upon that author's advice) are like- wise presented in Figure 12.

The points for 1936- 37 suggest another change of phase, this one prob- ably reflecting part of another cyclic decline. Even the data from Prairie du Sac's low-density grouse population, inferior that many of them are, reveal much the same phenomena (lower left, Fig- ure 12). From 1930 through 1932, phase changes seemed to grow increasingly favorable; then 1933-37 may be said to reflect a depression phase; apart from the loss of 1939, the gains for 1938-40 were increas- ingly strong for the densities; and, finally, the 1941- 43 gains, presumably occurring at the most favorable time of the cycle, show typically inverse ratios for high (for the area) April densities. Considering now the Connecticut Hill data on win- ter loss rates of ruffed grouse (Figure 13), we can see a tendency for the loss rates for comparable fall levels (272 to 295 birds) to rise as the population evidently heads toward a cyclic decline. Despite some variables in these data that I am in no position to evaluate, I would say that phase phenomena at Connecticut Hill show much the same sort of shifting and linkages as they do for the Minnesota grouse. Winter losses for the ruffed grouse of the Mic h- igan State Forests and for Prairie du Sac are not plotted, but, from the data (upper and lower right, Figure 12 and preceding text) some trends are easily perceptible. Fisher's 1933 spring census of 505 birds denotes a favorable phase and one followed by a high spring to fall rate of gain; the survivals for the next three winters suggest depressed phases as do the data for the following breeding seasons. At Prairie du Sac the wintering grouse populations responded pretty well to thresholds of around 18 to 20 (possibly lower in some years when lower den- sities wintered with little or no recorded loss) until the last three-year period; whatever may be said of the high winter survivals and the high rates of sum- mer gain in relation to density, 1940-44, together they seem to reflect a major and a most favorable phase. 80-/. fo d witer 1 33cs of dORffed Gro-,e o- -A304 acres, e t ~~~93 X o n _tr1cot~ H11Ira t/ ?&lt; 60-/. * ah Ed,-n.t, - data co- s' 40% 1933. 0 Wat, d73. de' v t ~~~~~~193&lt; 93?2 l o o e-b7/ 4 20Y*. 1993-3 193 3 1 AS 7*g 1930-31 3.0 J0 7%1 19-31 ~~1931-32 2172 '199 -17*/.

Rates of fall and winter loss of ruff ed grouse in relation to density, Connecticut Hill area, New York, 1930-37. Clarke's conclusion from his studies of the ruffed grouse in Ontario that "In a year of dying off, the number of young surviving is only half of that of a normal year" (8, p. 107) is weakened by his ap- parent neglect of possible density effects. However, his statement that "even though the first year of dying off in an area has reduced numbers to a point where the birds may be regarded as scarce, the suc- ceeding year may show a similar reduction in sum- mer flocks" (8, p. 77) has its parallel in the figures for the low of the cycle obtained from north-central United States. He reported much variation as to time of onset of the decline of the ruffed grouse in different parts of Ontario and that on the whole diminution in the Province occurred in 1933-34. His graphs of abundance for Ontario (8, pp. 21, 23) have no dates later than 1934, but it is rather obvious that the grouse over most of Ontario had not reached their minima by that time. The decline of the other classically cyclic North American species, the snowshoe hare, was pronounced on Green and Evan's Lake Alexander area in north- ern Minnesota from 1935 to 1938 (38). These authors later wrote (39, p. 356) that "of the young born in the summer of 1937 [when the species was approaching minimum numbers] only eight percent lived to February, the lowest rate of survival recorded in the seven years of our investigations." By 1935, the hares of the Hudson's Bay watershed were well along in a cyclic decline (54, p. 17).</page><page sequence="24">24 PAUL L. ERRINGTON Ecological Monographs Vo.15, No. 1 Turning back to Figures 5-9, we may perceive that 1936 had unusual significance in population phenom- ena either of bobwhites alone or of bobwhites in combination with other wild Galliformes at Prairie du Sac, Hunt City, Ames, and Faville Grove. Fig- ures 14-15, dealing with perdicine birds of Des Moines, Iowa (29, p. 86), southern Iowa (65, p. 720), Pine Bluff and Honey Creek Bottomlands of southern Wisconsin (18, pp. 17-21), Blissfield, Mich. (68, p. 77), and Stillwater, Okla. (4, pp. 113-115) show more evidence of a synchronously depressed phase in 1936 than in any other year. t C S[v"Iodo;*of10oo- t~~~~ 0 B~~~~~~~abhitw. orpon ieo gicat L .

At Hunt City and Ames (Figures 7-8), 1937 also was a year of pronounced depression of bobwhites or of combined wild Galliformes. It is hard to judge what other north-central Galli- formes showed in the way of depressions at the time of the cyclic minima for ruffed grouse and snowshoe hares. The percent of gain for the Faville Grove prairie chickens (see data, right center of Figure 9) was higher in 1936 than in any other year listed except one, but the low and waning status of these birds makes such a gain of dubious significance. At Hunt City (left center, Figure 7), rates of summer gain for the chickens were low for the spring den- sities in 1936 and 1937. There were probably some variables here due to the high mobility of the species and the small size of the area, which Yeatter (69. p. 394) is careful to remind us "represents the small- est unit indicated by Davison's study as represent- ative." The study by Davison referred to was one of a different species of prairie chicken (Tympanouchus pallidicinrctus) near Arnett, Okla. April-May cen- suses of cocks from 1932 to 1939 reveals lowest num- bers between 1936 and 1938 (no data for 1937) (10, p. 59); and, for the four-year period, 1932-35, fewer young were found per covey during the years of declining density, 1934-35 (10, p. 58) (Figure 16). o Zoo% _ BYbwhJfe, on obo,,* 3 000 . -1 -i9-40 -cres, Loke Corl BI/k,,ckvei &gt;1 1: F 'roj c t i fll-wote,, 0klo0hoa 2 o0taorre - figures as 0 C 150Y 4 Jq.lot, d jo_ . 1941 Ap / ga 100-4 K ? ~~~~~~~~~~Wi/d brds, Or/ly: 1939 300 j 565 .8% 94 0 70 U 200 I i6 % j_ 1941 1 75 3 95 / C. 0 00 150 ?00 ?50 300 Ap-i/ density Artifci,,olly pi-opaogtec berds i-elcosed (frornm angrnr tabuloted' doto): Sept 13, 1939 437 of 0 _ks Moy Z7, 1940 Z0 odults Jure 15, /94O 10 7 fdults ,JL,-e ZS, i 94 0 100 of 7 wka Oct. 6, 1940 /00 of 9 wks.

Thepphaseasant data from Prairie du Saf, Ames, and Faville Grove (Figures 6, 8, and 9) are insufficiently precise to justify many conclusions as to how much the rates of gain of the pheasants may have been depressed during low years of the cycle for grouse and hares, but, in general, the evidence indicates that the pheasants were not entirely exempt from depres-</page><page sequence="25">January, 1945 FIFTEEN-YEAR LOCAL STUDY OF THE NORTHERN BOBWHITE 25 sive influence at this time. In northwestern Iowa, Bennett and Hendrickson reported a poor recovery for pheasants during the breeding season of 1936 and an actual loss during that of 1937; despite the role ascribed to weather (5, p. 723), there could be much more behind the depressed rates of gain than weather or the factors commonly looked for. Recently Bach's (3, p. 8) figures on fluctuations of pheasants in North Dakota suggest depressed rates of summer gain for low May densities in 1938 (the earliest year for which data are given); gains in inverse ratio to somewhat higher densities in what may be interpreted as a more favorable phase, 1939- 40; and, finally, gains in inverse ratio to still higher densities at what seems to be a very favorable phase, 1941-43. The latter data, so far as they go, depict essentially the type of gains to be expected for ruffed grouse at different levels and different phases. Figure 17 relates to a number of species of western United States. The two years of data gathered by Yokum (70, p. 195) for Hungarian partridges and pheasants at Pullman, Wash., show, in combination, rather typical inverse ratios (right center and lower right). The 1942 depressed gain for a low density of scaled quail (Callipepla squtam~ata) in New Mex- ico (lower left) suggests cyclic influence having no synchrony with any cyclic phase that I recognize in the north-central states; Johnson, in presenting the data, wrote that the 1942 decline was "accompanied by an extraordinary reduction of cottontail rabbits" (46, p. 25). t 1 9 33 o Wren- tit, on /6&amp;7 acres, t i B 7 S X r 93t * Bcryc / o t t Er-ickts:or-). 19.32 Total Total S% Yeaor birds, birds, Percent 6g)L so% ~~~~early end of gain _____ Marc h breecn I j 25- 1932 45 76 69 % t'A l l/933 39 75 '92% t 4 &lt; 25 s50 t c Density, eorly March Z 60- California Quail, on 760acre 193 d 0 Dov;S, Col.

Horn (45, p. 745) refers to a poor hatch coinciding with a materially decreased adult population of California quail on another area in 1937. The two years of data available from California on Erickson's wren tits (Chamaea fasciata) (16, p. 311) and on Evans and Holdenried's Beechey ground squirrels (Citellus beecheyi) (36, p. 247) suggest only typical inverse ratios (upper left and right, Fig- ure 17). Burt's chipmunks (6, p. 46) and Haugen's cotton- tails (43, pp. 108-114) in Michigan showed inverse ratios, the former species in 1936 and 1937 as well as in 1935 (upper left, Figure 18). It may be re- called that 1936 was a poor year for cottontails at Prairie du Sac and elsewhere in southern Wisconsin (see discussion of "buffers" in this paper). Hamilton's meadow mice in New York (41, p. 782) certainly were depressed in 1936, whatever the data for the other years may signify with respect to phases (lower left center, Figure 18). In lower Figure 18, data are given for the long- tailed field mouse (Apodemtus sylvaticius) in England for three years antedating the Prairie du Sac study (14, p. 676).

The only north-central data on rates of gain ob- tained during the low years of the preceding cyclic decline are Kendeigh and Baldwin's (48, p. 100) for the house wren (Troglodytes domesticus) at Gate Mills, Ohio. The numbers of young raised per adult as plotted in Figure 19, upper left, do not conform too clearly to inverse ratios, but the years of lowest adult densities and two of the lowest rates of gain were 1926 and 1927, the low of the cycle for North American grouse and rabbits, generally (51, p. 65). Chapman's (7, pp. 61, 65 and 71) data on numbers of young tree swallows (Iridoprocne bicolor) raised per nesting box or pair at Princeton, Mass., show -what I would interpret as inverse ratios during a -favorable phase, 1934-35, and inverse ratios during :an unfavorable phase, 1936-37 (Figure 19, left cen- .er). The poor success of the lowered population of 1938 was linked with a weather emergency (7, p. 65). McClure's intensive study of the mourning dove (Zenaidura macroura) on comparable areas at Lewis, Iowa, 1938-39, did not coincide with any years of known cyclic depression of Galliformes in this region. Average numbers of young raised per pair conformed to inverse ratios, irrespective of whether the original (57, pp. 65, 67) or the revised (58, p. 384) estimates 992 # HO w en, On IS ocr Got. 9926 I 59 ' _923 9933 oK yod09 .

The 1940 investigations were not conducted on areas comparable to those of 1938-39, but this author estimated a slight decline from the over-all breeding level of 1939, with a considerably lowered rate of productivity (58, pp. 357-358, 362-367). Any eon- nection with the latter and the phase II performances of bobwhites at Prairie du Sac in 1940 is totally unproved, but such a possibility may be worth think- ing about, especially in view of the seeming operation of phase II at Ames in that year (Figure 8). M~rs. Nice's remarkably detailed investigation of the song sparrow (Melospiza melodias) at Columbus, Ohio (GO), lacks data on postnesting populations, but the percentages of song sparrow eggs producing either young song sparrows or, indirectly, young of their nest "parasite," the cowbird (Molothrus ater), may be at least partly indicative of reproductive sue- cess.

Detection of possible phase effects in the points plotted ( center, Figure 20 ) is made most uncertain because of the drastic changes in the habitat result- ing from human debrushing and other activities in the summer of 1932 (w60, p. 10c)s.

Rates of summer gain (or loss) of muskrats in relation to density on Iowa areas. Consult text for information on emergency losses resulting from droughts and floods. The central Iowa stream data (upper left, Figure 21) exemplify rates of gain under emergency and nonemergency conditions. The seasons of 1937 and 1939 were ones of prolonged, extreme droughts in late summer and fall, and the muskrats suffered con- spicuously. Only on one central Iowa stream ob- served-a drainage ditch near Story City-did water conditions remain favorable in 1937 and here the rate of gain of the animals was high (25, pp. 418- 419). Severe floods in 1940 and 1941 after the breed- ing season resulted in considerable losses of the immature, but it is not demonstrated that the de- pressed rates of gain in relation to density were due wholly to this cause. The central Iowa gains for 1938, 1942, and 1943 were probably typical for seasons essentially free from emergency depression; actually, severe mortal- ity of helpless young from floods occurred in May and June, 1942, but those losses were compensated by increased productivity in the latter part of the breeding season. The gains for 1942 and 1943 seem to be typically in inverse ratio to the May or breed- ing densities; that for 1938 is believed to reflect the inefficient mating of low densities. (In contrast with the bobwhite, which may be ob- viously successful in its mating at exceedingly low</page><page sequence="28">28 PAUL L. ERRINGTON Ecological Monographs Vo.15, No. 1 densities, the muskrat in Iowa has not shown good rates of increase at densities averaging less than the equivalent of about one pair per linear mile of small stream habitats or about one pair per 15 acres of marsh lands. This is regarded as one of the out- standing manifestations of underpopulation, of the tvpes studied notably by Allee and co-workers (1, 2).) At Round Lake, the population suffered from drought in 1936, but most of the animals lived in parts of the marsh having deep enough water to afford them protection (28, p. 176), and the poorness of the recovery certainly may be thought to reflect the influence of more than drought (Figure 21, left center). Neither may the gain for 1937 be quite as high as could normally be expected for the May den- sity and favorable breeding and rearing conditions. A more severe and prolonged drought occurred in late summer and fall of 1939 than in 1936 and the rate of gain was depressed to an iniperfectly ascer- tained extent by shallow zone losses (32, p. 855). Other than during emergency seasons or probable depression phases, the rates of gain tended to show typical inverse ratios. The Cheever Lake gains for 1939, 1942, and 1943 on about 200 acres of habitat showing relatively little change from year to year look rather typical despite much dry weather in 1939 (lower left, Figure 21). The depressed rate for 1941 is ascribed mainly to underpopulation phenomena; that for 1940 to a lethal drought (32, pp. 858-865). I do not know whether other factors were important in determining the pop- ulation trends for 1940 and 1941. We may naturally be hesitant about drawing many conclusions from the available data on rates of in- crease from given density levels of higher vertebrates, but it does appear that few north-central species thrived in 1936. The 1936 drought cannot be entirely dismissed from consideration as a depressive agency; nevertheless, the breeding season in this region had features not explainable in conventional terms of weather. Furthermore, the 1937 gains were abnor- mally low for some species in some north-central localities where weather conditions varied a great deal. We then have some justification for concluding that there may be a real linkage between the phase III (summer of 1936, winter of 1936-37) of the Prairie du Sac bobwhites, the low of the cycle for the region's ruffed grouse and snowshoe hares, and the clearly depressed rates of gain of various other mammals and birds in 1936 and to a considerable extent in 1937. If there is any connection between the phase II of the Prairie du Sac birds (summers of 1930, 1938, 1940-41, and 1943, and winters of 1938-39, 1940-42, and 1943-44) and similar depression phenomena to be noted elsewhere, I, at any rate, do not feel sure of it. Just enough scattered evidence exists, espe- cially for 1940 and 1941, to keep the question open. My reconstruction of the cyclic picture for the region (and possibly for other parts of North Amer- ica, as well) takes the following outlines: (a) For the classically cyclic ruffed grouse (and presumably the snowshoe hare) one phase graded off into another, rates of summer gain falling and rates of winter loss rising in relation to density as the depth of the cycle was approached. Then, after a period of extreme depression, rates of summer gain tended to rise and rates of winter loss to fall as the ascendancies got under way. Each distinguishable phase seemed to last from a few months to two or three years, with the extreme depressions showing the most synchrony between local areas. Very likely, the extreme depressions also showed the most perio- dicity-although gross fluctuation remains, up to re- cent years, the main criterion by which periodicity may be judged. (b) For the bobwhite, about the only evidence of periodicity was furnished by what may be called the phase III, representing the extreme depression syn- chronous with the low of the cycle for the region's ruffed grouse and snowshoe hares. This phase seemed to cover one or two years. The less pronounced but more frequent phase II depressions of summer gains and winter thresholds might conceivably be compared with some of the intermediate phases suggested by the grouse data except that they occurred with much greater irregularity and without the ascending and descending sequences with respect to the period of extreme depression. (c) For wild higher vertebrates of small to mod- erate sizes, generally, the years of extreme depression look pretty well synchronized, species with species and area with area. They have at least a semblance of an approximately 10-year periodicity. Other ap- parent phases showed variations with species, some indicating progressive changes and others a possible agreement with the in and out shifts of the Prairie due Sac bobwhites between phases I and II. And still others, let us not forget, experienced depression phenomena or unusually high rates of gain that did not seem to agree with any phase detected in the records for other species or for other areas. THEORY OF DEPRESSION PHASES The reader should not expect this section to answer more than a few of the questions that the preceding discussions may have brought to mind. Little enough concerning depression phases is really clear. Not only are we virtually without information as to causes, but serious deficiencies also exist in our knowl- edge of elementary properties. What, then, can we legitimately conclude at this time, with the least likelihood of contradiction by future researches? Probably certain of the mathe- matical aspects of the phase phenomena are as re- vealing as anything currently at hand. In the latter connection, I wish to express appre- ciation for curve-fitting and related cooperation by Professor F. A. Brandner, Department of Mathemat- ics, Iowa State College. To him should be credited all of the mathematical treatment of the north-central data here following. Sigmoid curves of the types used by many students</page><page sequence="29">January, 1945 FIFTEEN-YEAR LOCAL STUDY OF THE NORTHERN BOBWHITE 29 of populations, notably Pearl (see 62, pp. 558-637; 63, pp. 75-82), were fitted to the phase I and II data for rates of nonemergeney losses and summer gains at Prairie du Sac. It was found, however, on account of phenomena associated with thresholds, that a lower asymptote different from zero was required, at least within the numerical range covered by the data. The general form of equation for the curves is: K Y - yo = ? bN where y = percent of loss or gain, N = density, e = the base of natural logarithms, and K, A, and b are parameters estimated in the process of fitting. The curve in lower right, Figure 5, defined by the clearly phase I nonemergency loss rates (which are shown as beginning in early winter of the years 1929-35 and 1937) of bobwhites and pheasants, col- lectively, does not seem to conform to a single equa- tion. At subthreshold levels (below, let us say, 300 to 330 birds), the rates of loss are very slightly if at all accelerated with increasing density, and no for- mula was found that gave more than a poor fit for the curve as a whole. But for the five data points for densities exceeding threshold levels and hypothet- ical points calculated for 350- and 450-bird levels on the basis of probable threshold behavior, the curve conforms fairly well to the sigmoid: 31 y 1 + e 19.67 - .0486N' where y = percent of loss during approximately 41/2 winter months and N = density at the beginning of the winter. The error of estimate is 22.7% of the standard deviation. Phase II loss rates, beginning early in winter, 1938, 1940-41, and 1943, conform (so far as they go) to another sigmoid: 54 1 + 19.11e -0.0179N' with an error of estimate of 10.9% of the standard deviation. In the absence of definite data on rates of non- emergency winter loss rates for phase II at lower densities, we may get some idea of the possible lower asymptote by extrapolation-in any event, the curve approaches the lower asymptote at low densities. Two points other than the one for phase III, 1936, are left out of the above curves: those for loss rates beginning early in the winters, 1939 and 1942. We have some grounds for believing that the latter rep- resent transition winters (both were followed by phase II summer gains) between phases I and II rather than random departures from phase I. The summer loss rates of bobwhites, as computed for Figure 10, may here be considered much as were the winter rates. For phase I (1931-35, 1937, 1939, and 1942), a reasonably close-fitting curve seems to be: 73 Y = 1 + 8.94e -0.0034N' where y = percent of loss during approximately 41/2 months of late summer and early fall and N = com- puted midsummer density. The error of estimate is 9.7% of the standard deviation. For phase II (1930, 1938, 1940-41, and 1943), the formula: 90 Y = -.0N 1 + 11.8e 0.005N seems appliable, with an error of estimate of 8.0% of the standard deviation. The phase I curve in lower left, Figure 6, for rates of gain of bobwhites and pheasants, April to Novem- ber, 1931-35, 1937, 1939, and 1942, is described by the formula: 251 y-20 = 1 + 0.049e 0.0187Ns the error of estimate being 5.0% of the standard deviation. In this equation, y = percent of gain during summer and early fall from the April density, which latter is represented by N. The rates of gain for phase II (1930, 1938, 1940- 41, and 1943) responded less conveniently to curve- fitting, the formula obtained being: 265 y-15= 1 + 0.15e 0.0206N with an error of estimate of 14.0%o of the standard deviation. Figure 22 represents an attempt to learn something more regarding the lower asymptote of the curve for phase I. To the Prairie du Sac data were added data from Ames, where combined populations of bob- whites and pheasants showed rates of gain compa- rable to those of the Prairie du Sac birds at some comparable densities yet reached higher spring den- sities on two occasions. The data points for Ames, 1933-35 and 1938, are considered in phase I and together with the phase I points for Prairie du Sac, conform to the curve: 241 y - 20 = 1 + 0.052e 0.83N with an error of estimate of 15.4% of the standard deviation. Spring densities (N) were given in birds per 100 acres. Of the other points for Ames, that for 1940 is thought to represent phase II; those for 1936 and 1937, phase III, as does that of 1936 for Prairie du Sac. The significance of the high point (in relation to density) of 1939 is obscure. Could this possibly be a manifestation of an infrequently occurring fourth phase, an exceptionally favorable one? Or are we heading for error in attempting overmuch to place rates of gain into phase groupings?</page><page sequence="30">30 PAUL L.

Rates of summer gain (or loss) of mixed populations of bobwhites and ring-necked pheasants in rela- tion to density on areas at Ames, Iowa, and Prairie du Sac, Wis. Data points from the two areas were plotted together chiefly in an effort to learn more about responses at high densities. Phases I and II at Prairie du Sac seem almost as definite as the gear shift of an automobile. Ordina- rily, the population was in one phase or the other or in what could be interpreted as in transition (i.e., in the winters of 1939-40 and 1942-43). Summing up the evidence, I would say that the phase chronology of the area's bobwhites could de- fendably be outlined as follows: phase I, winter of 1929-30; phase II, summer of 1930; phase I, for the winters of 1930-36 and for all of the intervening summers, a strong 51/2 years; phase III, summer of 1936 and at least the early part of the winter of 1936-37; phase I, summer of 1937 and winter of 1937-38; phase II, summer of 1938 and winter of 1938-39; phase I, summer of 1939 and part of the winter of 1939-40; then, about two years or perhaps a little longer of phase II, beginning some time in the winter of 1939-40 and continuing through the winter of 1941-42; phase I, summer of 1942 and part of the winter of 1942-43; finally, phase II, for an undetermined period. In reviewing discrepancies between my versions of spring and fall data of Figures 5 and 6 and the val- ues that Kabat obtained independently from Gas- trow's journals, I recognized only one as having possibilities of changing the above phase assignments; it might be that the summer of 1938 was in phase I instead of in phase II. The gear-shift definiteness of the two principal phases at Prairie du Sac may not logically be ascribed to chance or to any of the usual biotic or climatic variations. Then, too, now that the pattern has been defined by the Prairie du Sac quail data, we can detect many signs of the same or similar phase effects in data for other areas and for other species. Despite much lack of synchrony in incidence of phases I and II for areas and species, there is surely more definite- ness in the parts of curves indicated by data points of Figures 7-9 and 11-21, generally, than merely "happened"; with Prairie du Sac in mind, the reader may easily see even in single "off" points possible manifestations of phases that might be quite well de- fined by more complete data. At any rate, deficiencies notwithstanding, the existing data would seem to attest very well to the reality of the phases here described. We admittedly have gone nearly as far into an inquiry of phase phenomena as the limitations of our knowledge permit. It becomes increasingly a temptation to postulate the operation of a master mechanism. Examples of local differences in mortality or fecun-</page><page sequence="31">January, 1945 FIFTEEN-YEAR LOCAL STUDY OF THE NORTHERN BOBWHITE 31 dity from one cause or another multiply with each careful study that is made, but the net effects of so many of these differences are so often partially if not wholly cancelled out by intercompensatory trends that their roles as truly limiting factors become dubi- ous, indeed. The over-all dominance of the phases remains- density depression modified by what else? As Elton wrote in his book on fluctuations of mouse-like rodents (13, p. 230), "So we are left . . . with a good many hints of some great cosmic oscil- lation, expressing itself in periodic upheavals in the biotic community, but we still lack the full key to the problem . . . ," thus we also are left. And we like- wise have grounds for concurring with Elton's thought that in time ". . . we may begin to understand this extraordinary oscillation, which I cannot help be- lieving, will lead us back to very curious meteorolog- ical and perhaps astronomical processes. The possible connection between sunspot cycles and animal fluctuations has been a subject of much at- tention (for a recent review, see 9, pp. 177-199), finally receiving from MacLulich's work on the snow- shoe hare in Canada what looks like conclusive dis- proof (54, pp. 104-113). But might there not be relationships with things other than sunspots, which our current ignorance prevents us from recognizing? The great majority of species of which I know that would seem to suffer predation or nonemergency losses most nearly in proportion to total numbers are invertebrates and lower vertebrates. Higher verte- brates, of kinds treated within this paper, suffer relatively more in proportion to numbers during their immature stages, but it can be readily seen, for ex- ample, that the Prairie du Sac bobwhites in phase I did not suffer even at immature stages at rates com- parable to those for phase II and that phase III was accompanied by rates of nonemergency losses more in proportion to numbers than at any other time. In Figure 23 are plotted, with reference to densities per 100 acres, all of the percentages of actual or computed nonemergency losses of low-mobility native Galliformes during phase III, or its judged equiva- lent, that I have been able to get together. Rates of summer loss of bobwhites on different areas were computed on the same basis as the rate for Prairie du Sac (see Figure 10 and associated discussion). I make no claims for my figure of a 55% summer loss for the Connecticut Hill grouse ex- cept that it is the best that I could arrive at from the data published by Edminster (12, pp. 826, 831, and errata slips); it is probably too conservative. The points of Figure 23 do not line up well enough to encourage curve-fitting, but, assuming that the summer loss rate at Connecticut Hill was materially higher than I computed, we have only one point (for southern Iowa) that departs radically from the trend shown by the others. We see, then, what seems to be a general tendency of nonemergency loss rates during the low of the cycle to be a function of density, per se, young birds or old, summer or winter. What the cyclic depression may do, in effect, is to nullify the advantages higher vertebrates at low to moderate densities usually enjoy by virtue of their superior ability to take care of themselves, individ- ually. Protection normally afforded by thresholds seems to be greatly lessened at such times. In other words, during phases of maximum de- pression, we may see, with respect to relatively scarce higher vertebrates, the most literal realization of the thesis of proportional predation of McAtee and others (55). The mere fact that losses may not be due even largely to predation does not alter the fact of vul- nerability; and the frequently observed interplay and superimposition of disease, weather emergencies, hu- man interference, etc., should not outweigh evidences of lowered, collapsed, or suspended thresholds. I am not sure that the phase phenomena of ruffed grouse and bobwhites are so very closely linked. The grouse data seemed to reflect a gradual tightening, a climax, then a relaxation of some adverse factor, but, within what may be judged to be particular phases, the species showed considerable uniformity in re- sponding to density. The bobwhite, on the other hand, switched from phase to phase according to no rhythm that I can see, except in its lowest depression phase, which coincided with those of its own and other species over wide areas. The many weather, environmental, nutritional, and disease hypotheses that have been put forward in explanation of animal cycles have, in my opinion, one common disqualification if applied to the phase phenomena that may be a primary attribute of such eyeles. I do not see how they can account in any way whatever for the definiteness of responses in relation to density that are to be expected for given phases.

ERRINGTON Ecological Monographs PAUL L. ERRINGTON ~~~~~~~~~~Vol. 1-5, No. ' The only alternative hypothesis that has so far appealed to me is one of a dominant agency bringing on depression phases through modification of ordinary limits of intraspecific toleration in the species affected. This, let it be confessed, is inspired more by largely unpublished data on the influence of changed intra- specific tolerance in muskrat populations than by any observations on Galliformes, but I have been unable to think of contrary facts that would rule out the broader application. The validity of such a hypothesis is nevertheless conditioned by too many unknowns to warrant de- tailed exposition at this time. Quite possibly, it may not be the answer at all. Thus, this paper closes on an unfinished job, on what can be but a preliminary treatment of the den- sity factor that may so mightily dominate the course of populations. And it also closes in a way reminis- cent of Pearl &amp; Parker's (64, pp. 215-216) reference to "apparently another element . . . besides mere physical density, which element in our ignorance we may perhaps tentatively call psychological." SUMMARY A 15-year ecological study on an area of 4,500 acres near Prairie du Sac, Wis., was centered upon the bobwhite quail but also dealt with a number of associated species, especially other wild Galliformes, predators, and "buffers." It was found that year-to-year differences in many of the conventionally regarded "limiting factors" had no perceptible influence on basic population trends. Although severe mortality frequently resulted from starvation and weather emergencies, and through the medium of predation, the outstandingly influential factor in the population mechanics of north-central states bobwhites was seen to be their own density relations as modified by what may be termed depres- sion phases. The data available from Prairie du Sac, other north-central areas, and the literature showed a very strong tendency for bobwhite population gains in a specific locality, spring to fall, to be in inverse ratio to spring densities. These rates of gain plotted against densities on coordinate paper tended to define reverse sigmoid curves, seemingly irrespective of most variations in temperature, rainfall, farming practices, and kinds and numbers of associated wild species, including predators. Rates of summer gain of bobwhites in relation to density were subject to depression through the pres- ence of introduced wild Galliformes (such as ring- necked pheasants, which, as bobwhite competitors, may be thought of somewhat in the sense of extra bobwhites); but the most pronounced depressions of summer gains occurred through the evident operation of the phases. Similarly, the data showed a strong tendency for rates of nonemergency winter loss (including most loss from simple predation and from inter- and intra- specific adjustment) to follow mathematical patterns determined by density and phase effects. Wintering populations experienced low rates of nonemergency loss and little if any acceleration of loss rates with rising densities as long as the populations remained below thresholds of security; but such loss rates for populations in excess of secure levels tended, when plotted against densities, to define characteristic sig- moid curves. Inverse ratios in summer gains and operational levels of winter thresholds showed what looked like phase linkages. Except for the summer of 1936 and the winter of 1936-37, Prairie du Sac bobwhite populations were responsive to two recognized phases, one of "normal" and the other of depressed rates of summer gain and correspondingly increased rates of nonemergency win- ter loss. Within the time-span of influence imposed by each phase, the above rates of gain or loss con- formed to mathematical formulas with a high degree of predictability; but the time of changing of one phase to the other was not predictable according to any known criteria. It would be premature to try to say just how closely the two main phases of the Prairie du Sac bobwhites may be identified with the general "game cycle" in the north-central region, but a third extreme phase appeared to be linked with extreme depressions (in 1936 and 1937) of nearly all of the region's mammals and birds about which information is available. In the case of the classically cyclic ruffed grouse, the lesser phase changes seemed to follow a more pre- dictable course, one of progressive sequences as the low of the cycle was approached or passed. Despite an apparent lack of synchrony and perio- dicity in the two main phases of the Prairie du Sac bobwhites and what would seem to be similar phases of this and other species elsewhere, the suggestion is made that depressed rates of summer gain and in- creased rates of winter loss in relation to density, if not clearly due to emergencies, may be more reliable indications of cyclic behavior than the often over- stressed gross fluctuations in numbers of animals. This applies particularly to species that are highly susceptible to confusing emergency losses-as the bobwhite wintering in the northern parts of its geo- graphic range. Of the properties shown by the bobwhite and at least some other higher vertebrates during cyclic de- pressions, one may be judged significant: a tendency to suffer nonemergency losses more nearly in straight proportion to numbers than at other times. No really satisfactory explanation for phase phe- nomena, periodic or otherwise, yet seems to be in sight. Current preference is expressed for some sort of cosmic influence possibly modifying the psychology (notably as concerns limits of intraspecific toleration) of the species affected.
