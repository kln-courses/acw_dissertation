<plain_text><page sequence="1">PALLADAS ON TYCHE PALLADAS can hardly be credited with either a religious creed or a philosophical system, but he held some powerful convictions which were not necessarily consistent but certainly reflected his emotional responses to a life embittered by poverty (A.P. 9. 169, 175; II. 302, 303), a nagging wife (9. 168; I I. 378), and a profession which he detested (9. 171, 173, 174). In so far as he believed that a single power controls circumstances, it was Tyche, to whom he refers with frequent comments, usually hostile. By the latter part of the fourth century A.D. the ancient belief in Tyche had become intellectually respectable in certain Pagan circles. There were of course those who followed the Cynics in denying any importance to her (Stob. 2. 7. 21), and their rejection of her can be seen, in different forms and at different levels, in a Hermetic text which regards her as opd d'-'TKTOg, EVEpYEtaL E'WuAOV, 8da bEvS's- (Stob. I. 41. i), in an anonymous couplet,' which looks as if it came from the last years of Paganism: dIpEKES 1LcAa r it -rAdcvrq Tr7 ? r'fl poro-Uv ECMr yp c pcvE?7, ry aaE7rr 0 rAEov otV8E rrEAovaa, (A.P. 9. 135) and in the Platonist Proclus, who said 7rv coaoviatov ov8&amp; . .. 8.ErOcu 7' rd'x (in Plat. Tim. 61 b). But despite this current of doubt and dissent, and despite, or perhaps because of, the rivalry of Christianity, there is no doubt of the high position of Tyche in the years from Julian to Theodosius. She had temples at Caesarea (Sozomen. 5. 4. 2), Antioch (Julian, Apophthegm. 176, p. 223 Bidez- Cumont), Alexandria (Liban. Progymn. 12. 25. 6), and Constantinople (id. Or. 30. 51). The last champions of Paganism held her in great regard. Julian, writing in 361 to his maternal uncle and namesake about the prospects of battle with Constantius, speaks of his intention -r TvgXI 7&amp; wdva Kat o70LS OEOLS E'77tpE'ag TEpL/LdVELw (Ep. 28, p. 34. 18 Bidez-Cumont). His friend Sallustius, who shared and clarified some of his ideas, assigns her an unusually reputable place in the scheme of things: 7roLvvv 7Ta 8&amp;dopa Kal 7a -rap' EA7T8cSa LvdtpEva 7Trrpdo yaOv 1-crovaaU 8VvaLs- Trv OEWV TvX7, voLu'EEra, Kal &amp;iL i-ro1^o tdAACra KOraKlO T TOdAELS 07V OE poV 7O7)pKEL (9, p. 20. 2 Nock). Libanius tells at length of the many occasions in which Tyche has helped him and at one point (Or. I. 266) speaks of 9E63 Te Ep7YOV Ka, 5q' i a T ircvra, TtiXrlg. In the latter part of the fourth century this view was common in Pagan circles, and it survived in them even later, when Eunapius speaks of -r7- EC e &amp;rav7ra VEWrEpoLv'SOr T;Xrs- (Vit. Soph., p. 21 Boiss.). We might expect Palladas, who was an educated man, to share these views, but he goes his own way and develops his own view of Tyche, which has its roots in a different intellectual and social world and reveals striking idiosyncrasies. An examination of what he says about her throws light not only on his unusual personality but on his response to some events which he witnessed and perhaps on his personal history. Palladas' conception of Tyche is founded on views which had long been held The third line given by the manuscripts is clearly a marginal note. Cf. P.

In one place he shows an unusual detachment and speaks of her in traditional language: 7TAov1L uracAepo &amp;g -ro'v* XEtIua~oI?LEO v Yap ECL av7 7roAAaKL vav-q'ywV 7T7atoLEV OK7pdoEpc' rqv 8E Tv' yv /dOLOTOCO KVUEpVTEtpcLV 'OVTES w9 Et -7roTEACYVS, ov t~abfloAot ITAE'0Ev, ot p!V T E,2TAOUvV, 0OL ' E'/.kI7Tav? aL,' Jpa rrmVLc ELgS Eva VKa 70 K C yC g plov arEPX10Ea. (Io. 65) The conception of Tyche as the KvgEpvYr7pEa who guides human beings across the sea of life goes back through Philostratus, Vit. Soph., p. 56. 22 Kays. 59. 11 v-;x~ . . . KVflEpvCo-qs- Jrav7a, to Menander fr. 483. 9 K. 'dX7 KUvEpVX TV7ra. Though Palladas does not deny or abandon what he says in this poem, it is in fact the kindest tribute which he pays to Tyche, since in it he says neither that she gives more ill fortune than fair nor that she favours bad men at the expense of good. He certainly does not see her as a transcendental automaton, and his anthropomorphic language reflects his belief in her as an active, personal power. His special view of her comes from the insistence with which he stresses certain aspects of her behaviour and the conclusions which he draws from them. Precedents for Palladas' view of Tyche may perhaps be found in one or two moments of Attic Tragedy, when some inexplicable disaster provokes the suggestion that there is no reason or justice in the ordering of human affairs and that Tyche works in them at random. Something of the kind comes to Iocasta's mind in her agony about the fate of Oedipus (Soph. 0. T. 977 ff.) and is more clearly expressed by Talthybius when he sees Hecuba in the full humiliation of her grief (Eur. Hec. 488 ff.). But Palladas may equally have been influenced by a humbler art, by the occasional denunciations of Tyche which are found on epitaphs; notably in such sentiments as OA[[EYev 'q ]OovEpd -r[oi cd]yaOo' t T;X-q (Kaibel no. 489. 4), a vaovEpd ' i4 is rdvr' 86&amp;ooOaa TvX (I.G. xiv. 2437. 5), -r7Pov 8' oicK acE T'XiT qatlpwv 7aL daoyturosr o avv'TaL LEUdawov (Peek no. 1350. io-Ii). Yet such outbursts are after all natural expressions of grief in moments of loss, and none of them is nearly so compre- hensive as Palladas' embracing view of Tyche. He seems to expand what the stricken or bereaved may feel in a tragic crisis to the whole of life, and to adapt conventional views of her to suit it. How he does this may be illustrated by a poem which goes much further than Io. 65 in its characterization of Tyche: o0) Adoov, o0 vdlov oLsE T"X' X, (LEpdoIV 'r vpawVE, 'otg LtoS JAocyw poEvacl ,U vpo0J-EIw. pdAhov TOLs ~ a&amp;KOt L PE7TEL, LTEUEL 'E 8tKaL'OVS!, WS ,E7TrL8EtKVVLLEV17 T7-V AOyOV 8Vvat~Lv. (io. 62) In his notion of her as a tyrant he advances upon such a popular idea as GEacrotTvVw Ti5XrJs (Kaibel no. 526. 2) or iravsaytdrELpa (LG. xii. 5. 303),and gives it a sharper edge. When he says that Tyche has no Adyos, he is not far from Euna- plus' belief in her as -'iv ~Aoyov TSX7v (Vit. Soph., p. 25 Boiss.), but this is only a part of his whole conception, and the complete picture is built up by a series of strokes, of which each may in itself be familiar but the combined effect is</page><page sequence="3">120 C. M. BOWRA strikingly unfavourable to her. So when Palladas speaks of her CA'ta4Lra, or caprices, he may have found the idea in Menander, who uses it to explain rapid changes of fortune: TO 7ijq T a5q' yap pppa LEteL7fr7TTet raXv. (fr. 84- 5 K.) What Menander regards as a self-evident fact to be accepted with patience Palladas denounces with indignation. In his eyes the caprices of Tyche are more likely to favour the unjust than the just. Whereas Menander is concerned with the instability of existence, Palladas is obsessed by its fundamental in- justice. The way in which Palladas shifts from the consideration of fair and foul fortune to the question of whether they come to those who deserve them can be seen from comparing two poems which are clearly related. In I0. 96 he is occupied by the unpredictable changes in human life and especially with the way in which Tyche makes the poor rich and the rich poor. He says nothing about the rights and wrongs of it: his complaint is that he cannot understand it and for this reason does not know how to face Tyche, but at the end he breaks out into virulent abuse: 7rotw Tpo7rw yap 7rEpLyEvozLaL r-gs, TiXns 9s E, J5rAov Ea aLVQqLEVS VU PC tU, iropvrs yvvaLKog 70tVS 7porovS KEK7T'tEVrq S; (Io. 96. 8-io) To call Tyche a strumpet may be to anticipate Hamlet, but it is extremely violent for a Greek, and the occasion for it is simply that she is responsible for the ups and downs of human fortune. In confining her activities to this Palladas is still restricted by conventional notions of her, but in another poem he advances from them and sees her activities as a problem for ethics: Sv t qj yEAw/LEUv TOV f lov rv SpaTrEqvY TiX-q TE TrrOpV7)1g pE(LacOV KLVOVtLEVr7V, ovvrqv E avTOLS t7rpoEVOvLpEv 7avroVTE dva~lovs dpWvrTES EVTVXEorTEPOVS. (io. 87) In this poem Tyche is called a harlot because the unworthy prosper. The pEvta-ra of Tyche are in their favour, and she deserves the name of rdpvYw be- cause of the inconstancy with which she bestows her graces and her preference for rich suitors. How outrageous the word would seem to a Greek public may be deduced from the fact that when the poem appears on the wall of a latrine at Ephesus, the second line has been changed to IrTLVOVTE&amp; ' 1-g1X;VTCES , qE Aovt'VOL.' If even in this humble setting Palladas' words were thought to be excessive, we can gauge how strong they were, and how little respect he had for conventions when he wrote them. Libanius, who himself held Tyche in high honour, admits that it is common form to revile her: o) P44&amp;ov EvVrXE, rg,W iv3pes, cdvOpCarr C7L Ao03opoivrr rTv TvgrlYV Ka, 7 L EV d6LKOv, a rg7dV 8E cvUX KaAoOv7L (Or. 6.

Such abuse was not to be found among philosophers, and with them Palladas has little in common. His notion of an irrational, immoral Tyche, who treats mankind as her plaything, recalls the Greek romances. Achilles Tatius regards the world as 7-r Tdxqjg~ yvbwlvEov (5. 2. 3), and when things go wrong for his heroes and heroines uses such phrases as rad&amp;v' co rdAw t4 TiXq (4- 9- 7), dl 7q 7-q TirXS. irauS (5I. I), EKECVOQvS liV 7TrvTas (70os gavd-rovs) j TdXr 7 raLE Ka7-' ' O0o (7. 5. 2). In a similar spirit Charito calls Tyche fldaKavos (I. 14. 7; 4. I. 12; 5- 1. 4) and AOdVELKKoQ (2. 8. 3), and Nonnus, writing romance in verse instead of in prose, moves on similar assumptions in av8poudvY, rroA1dopq~E TXr, 7ratovara y EvlOqv (Dionys. 16. 220). Against this popular and unphilosophical background we may set a poem of Palladas: The belief in a frivolous Tyche who treats mankind as her plaything is trans- ferred from romance, where it helps the improbable developments of the plot, to events of every day and becomes more sinister and more alarming. If mankind is the calyvwov of Tyche, the game is played on a world-stage, on which she is dramatist, producer, and sometimes judge.' The notion is of some antiquity, and the germ of it can be seen in Diogenes' words i tvx oEep 7oo7Tpla I oEKa (Stob. 2. 7. 2), and there are several traces of it in Polybius, who speaks of her in such phrases as ida her plaything S (2. 35. 5), 74, m EITx . r7V Ecfapav civaf3Lf a0odal7s 7srvv vIETipaY 4yvocav (II. 5. 8), and calls her a judge, o pa3erej (i. 58.

The notion was taken up by other writers and developed in different directions. morucian speaks of orp Kalarming K - If mpo ankind is the (igrin. 20), but it is the novelists who make the most of it.

Palladas was familiar with this notion and saw its implications and its possibilities. While for Polybius it was a means to unfold the dramatic story of Rome's rise to power, and for the novelists a suitable way of creating suspense and excitement, both used it both for good and for bad fortune. But Palladas assumed that the dramatic character of human life, devised and played by a supernatural (io. 72) Palladas has no illusions about the painful character of what happens, and he 1 0!-- (IO. 7? ) ' G.

The first is that we must not treat it seriously but make fun of it as it makes fun of us, and the second is that we must learn to endure its griefs. The couplet sums up his own dilemma and explains much in him that might otherwise seem paradoxical. Palladas certainly had a grudge against life and especially against his own lot in it. In trying to come to terms with experience he tried both of the methods which he mentions above. Mockery was his strongest suit, and, as he himself says, he delighted in it: dVL'tEL LV LEVapLU(TOV, 0 S ZEbOY3 oEXGEOS g pX" ,AAd KaKCW5 ELTTELV ."rt"LKO) cr-r, p'AtL. (II. 341) The violence of some of his attacks on both public and private characters, whom he regards as receiving rewards beyond their merits or not living up to their principles or holding public office for their own advantage, are of a remarkable sharpness and even scurrility. He does not spare such persons as Themistius (I I. 292) or Gessius (7. 681-8) or Maurus (1I. 204) or Gennadius (1 I. 280), all of whom were prominent figures of his time, and his candour and courage in dealing with them are proof of his sincerity. In all he finds some conflict between what they get and what they really deserve, and his judgement comes down firmly against them and the system which allows such injustice. On the other hand, he knew that this was not the way to win happi- ness or prosperity, and of course it may well have been dangerous. That no doubt is why, as he says at i i. 340, he has sworn countless times not to write any more epigrams. The alternative was to do nothing, and this is what he urges in different forms at 10. 46, 51, 77, 78, 86. His savagery in attack arose from his strong sense of justice. What others might take more lightly aroused him to fury, and when the fury was on him, he could not but speak out in violence. And this sense of unrighteous anomalies in the world was strengthened by his belief that Tyche was responsible for them. In so far as he had a central principle in things, it was Tyche, and in her he saw a power for evil. What carries his poems about Tyche beyond all other Greek poems about her is precisely his outraged sense of justice, his injured conscience, his conviction that such things happen only because the scheme of things is irrational and wrong. He knew that he would be happier if he abandoned his furies and his denunciations, but it was extremely difficult for him to do so; for when he felt in this way, his poetry at least gave him some kind of relief from it in the con- sciousness that he was speaking the truth. Palladas' view of Tyche was submitted to a peculiar test when her cult and popularity received an almost mortal blow in the intestine conflicts between Christians and Pagans in Alexandria. Four poems of Palladas are concerned with this from a special angle, and we may fix their date and circumstances from the simplest and shortest of them: aVEa-rpaq7rlaav, W pco, "ral rpLyla"a Ka%% 'n v TMf, virvy 8UcU"xovcav EL'OLEV. (9. I81) This is certainly to be connected with another poem which ends avecYmpaqST yap rcdv'ra v~v i(. rrp,,.'a7ra (Io. 9o. 7)</page><page sequence="6">PALLADAS ON TYCHE 123 and is concerned with the troubles of the "EAAXrvES or Pagans in the riots of 39 I, when the edicts of Theodosius proscribing the performance of Pagan rites (Cod. Theod. i6. Io. Io and II) were voluntarily enforced, probably beyond what the Emperor intended, by the Bishop Theophilus and his fanatical monks, who destroyed the temples of Sarapis, Mithras, and Dionysus (Socr. 5. I6. I ; Sozom. 7. 15. 2-3; Zosim. 5. 2. 3). The temple of Tyche was not destroyed, and its doors were still standing in the seventh century (Theophyl. Simocatt. 8. 13), no doubt because the laws of the city were inscribed upon them, but like an- other temple, at Constantinople (Ioh. Lyd. de Mens. 4. 132), it was turned into a Ka7rhlqAEov or tavern. Before its transformation we know something of it from Libanius, who says that it had a TE'EVOS in the middle of the town and contained statues of all the gods, but in the middle of them TV'is E"rTKEV Xyahpa urT~Cdvw &amp;7Ao~v vAA4%diV8pou a'S VMKas-.

The transformation of this majestic edifice, with all its proud associations, into a tavern struck Palladas' imagination very forcibly, and he responded with a characteristic irony and a special kind of wit, at once metaphysical and verbal, which he found appropriate when he had to deal with some surprising or para- doxical situation like this. The way in which the degradation of Tyche affects Palladas may first be examined in a highly concentrated poem: TUX-q Ka-)r)AEvovaa rrdvra vTv /l3ov, auuryKEpacrTov r-)v q%'uLv KEKTJLEV?7 Kal oUUvKUK'wca Kat /,ETavrTAovo ai rrvL v, KaYt7 Kar-I)rAoS' EUTL VVV TL3S, o0 OcEa, Tcrcxv-qv AaXoi(craiv 7Tpo~rwv &amp;raeav. (9. I8o) Here a single image dominates the plan and is put to special purposes. Tyche has always been a KicrrAos trafficking in human fortunes, but now she has been reduced to working in a tavern and selling wine, and her punishment fits her crimes. The wider implications of this image are exploited in lines 2-3, where each phrase makes a new point. When Palladas says that Tyche has an davy- KEpaUrov nature, he uses the word in the sense of 'unmixed' (Hesych. iKpaTros duysyS, davyKEpaaros-), which is admirably appropriate to wine in its raw state and suggests that her nature has all the dangerous potency of wine not mixed with water. The metaphor has distant precedents in Aesch. P. V. 678 aJKpaTros dpy-rv and in Plat. Legg. 4- 722 c, on the application of force without persuasion, dKPa7r CdVO1 v 4 g1'. It gives a vivid hint of Tyche's violent character. In the next line the image passes from what she is to what she does, and both par- ticiples carry a full meaning. UvyKUK~Uaa refers to the confusion, in every sense of the word, which Tyche brings into everything and it awakes echoes of the classical use of KVKaV for stirring up trouble (Archiloch. fr. 67. 1 D.; Sol. fr. 1. 61 D.; Sapph. fr. 137- 4 L.-P.; Ach. 531 oavyKVK.); L-rE7avrTAOVGa refers to her interferences with the proper functions and character of things. Palladas presents Tyche as a mischievous busybody who spoils everything that she touches. The skill of the poem lies in the translation of something powerfully felt into a neat and inclusive image which reveals the true character of Tyche's " R. Keydell, Byz. Zeitschr. 1 (1957), 1-3.</page><page sequence="7">124 C. M. BOWRA activities before she was discredited by defeat. It is a good example of Palladas' poetical wit, which gives definiteness and precision to a situation which might otherwise be lost in general considerations, and it shows exactly what he feels. In a third poem on the same situation Palladas derides Tyche for having become drvxgjs and insists that she must draw the right conclusions from it: Kac avr, TvX'- q rrotoLa, TX-qv d VX? ro60EV ExEg; 7TrrapExovora TvXas 75 TgarvX7JS3 yq/ovag; (LuavavOCVE Kal (t) EpEL v Ta( oTa p'ctC'lara, KaiU (ti) &amp;LacKOV TagS c7vxLEV rLTV( oELS arS aPEXELS ETEpOLg. (9. I82) In addressing her as Sarowa Palladas ironically gives her the title which she held before her fall, and thereby contrasts her present state with her former 8EooEro(tv'7q, which was manifest not only in her magnificent temple but in her control of human affairs. Having lost this position, she must now suffer what she used to inflict upon others, especially the EV'lpe-ra, which were her speciality (10o. 87, 96), and the 7TTWrcELS, or falls, which she used to distribute (Io. 80). The point of the poem is that Tyche has now to endure her own attacks, and though this is expressed with wit and fancy in the notion that she has become d-rvxys, it contains a serious idea, which is that such a power as Tyche, being essentially irrational and irresponsible, embodies in herself contradictions which work her ruin. Palladas' approach to the subject may be viewed from two angles. In the first place his attack could hardly fail to make an impression on those who still held Tyche in honour. In their world of mythological belief her collapse should indicate a real disaster. They might still believe in her existence, but they could hardly continue to believe in her omnipotence. Secondly, Palladas puts into a special, poetical form his own feelings about her. She, in whom he has un- doubtedly believed even if he has hated her, is now manifestly humbled. The transformation of her temple is patent evidence that she cannot look after herself, and to this degree her old claims are discredited. This poetical approach masks another which may be called philosophical. What Palladas discerns in the fall of Tyche is that the irrational principle in control of things, to which he has hitherto adhered, cannot bear the test ofevents. There is something wrong in it, and he can no longer treat it seriously. His derisive triumph over Tyche reflects a triumph over something in himself. The fourth poem picks up themes from the preceding three and looks as if it were intended to be the climax of the series: Kal av', T yXc7, Aotrrov LEwlgasLAAoC(zEV7 KaTanraOVa o fffI7E 7VX1 7 Tj7S U7S U7VUTaTa ELL(OcLrE`V 7 -rrpCv vrqov 'Xovua Kar~7AEV`Et -rcLa y 717pag, OEptLzOYTL tpO'voWV Vvv aVakaLvotzE'v-q. must now accept the fact that she has become such herself, and the word advancing beyond the transformation of her temple into a tavern to her own degradation in becoming a OBEpLodLr?. Stadtmueller follows the marginal</page><page sequence="8">PALLADAS ON TYCHE 125 scholium, which says &amp;OpPtovs 7rCAoi3cra -roI irwvq~uvw, and suggests that now Tyche sells the poorest kind of food, cakes made of lupines, to low-class customers. 0&amp;'p/ot were indeed the food of the poor (Alex. frs. 162. I I ; 266.2 K.; Timocl. fr. 18. 4 K.; Ammian. A.P. I I. 413. 6), but this interpretation does not suit the text very well, since the termination -387t, surely excludes the notion of selling. It is easier to assume that OEPto8d-r7LS is the feminine form of &amp;Epjo- Sd rT/, the slave who brings hot water at baths, and whose task is ,Epo8Looia (Herod. Med. ap. Orib. 5. 30. I9). The task of Tyche is not merely mean but slavish, and, as avabatvodvrv- proclaims, manifest to everyone. Her humiliation should be a lesson to Tyche, whom Palladas now calls a-rara- SaFtov, and in these last words he sums up what he feels about her. The application of xcrraros to Tyche is as old as Epicurus (Ep. 3, p. 65 U.), and Palladas no doubt uses it to dismiss not only his own belief in Tyche but a whole history of such belief which has lasted for centuries. So too the application to her of the word 3a-Idov, which does not occur in the preceding poems, takes account of the high regard in which she has been held. She who has been the mistress of every- thing must now lament her lot dotws, and with this Palladas completes his lesson for her. These poems indicate what kind of belief Palladas had in Tyche, and what degree of reality he ascribed to her. It is clear that she is much more real to him than are the Olympian gods, whose misfortunes in the riots of 391 raise no fundamental questions or regrets for him (9. 441, 528, 773), and evoke no more than a smile. To them elsewhere he pays almost no attention, and his only tribute is to say that Zeus would have been a parricide if his father had been mortal (Io. 53). But just as he abounds in references to Tyche on other oc- casions, so in her hour of catastrophe he devotes special care to her because she has an unusual significance for him. She is a real figure in his depleted cosmology because she symbolizes the irrational and unjust scheme of things in which men live. Yet she is also more than a symbol; for she is an active living force who embodies all that Palladas hates and condemns in his own circumstances and whom he regards as responsible for it. His quarrel, which cannot be denied or dismissed, with the scheme of things he dramatizes as a quarrel with Tyche. Such a point of view is easily intelligible in the latter years of the fourth century A.D., when in Pagan circles a growing scepticism and sense of futility was matched by various efforts to treat mythical figures as manifesta- tions of abstract, cosmic powers. Palladas shows both tendencies. In his rejec- tion of the Olympian system and of any coherent philosophy he believes in an irrational universe, and for this he finds his symbol in Tyche. When he sees her temple turned into a tavern, he feels that somehow he has scored off her, and though these poems are built on ingenious tropes and have their full measure of verbal ambiguities, they reflect something entirely human and real in Pal- ladas. He treated the crisis seriously and saw in it more than an imaginary humiliation of Tyche. Her fall delivered him from something that he had hitherto believed, and we must ask to what new conclusions this brought him and what gain, if any, he got from it. At the start it is remarkable that Palladas should tell Tyche to lament her lot ietws. In the ironical and satirical context the word stands out as more patently serious than anything else, and there is no reason to think that it has lost any of its pristine gravity or is not intended to strike home. Palladas tells Tyche that she must order herself reverently in her change of situation, and</page><page sequence="9">126 C. M. BOWRA such reverence implies some power to whom it must be paid. The obvious candidate for this is Christianity, which has visibly triumphed by depriving Tyche of her temple and her glory. This does not prove that Palladas accepts the Christian system. His very omission of any reference to it is significant. But it does show that he recognizes the existence of some power more worthy of reverence than Tyche, and when he tells her to accept her lot daws, he means, in plain language, that the old scheme of an irrational universe which called for abuse must give place to another scheme which calls for respect. We do not know what this is, but it is certainly implied, and we must conclude that in abandoning his belief in Tyche Palladas replaced it with something which he found more satisfying and more worthy of reverence. Tyche indeed, whose power and activity he has acknowledged, he has never reverenced, and now that he has seen through her claims he finds something else more deserving of his devotion. A little light is thrown on this problem by some other lines of Palladas, which evidently come from a time when he said good-bye to Tyche, and may there- fore be connected with his rejection of her after her humiliation. The manu- scripts present them as a quatrain: 'EArdSos oi3 Tvxr-v ErL (OL t LEAt, ot03' AEYIO AoLtrrv - ' " d iv-s 'ijAvOov E4s AL'Jva. EtCL 7rITVTS avOpw'Os, 'EAEVOEpl' S ovvoLKW" 6flpLtrov 7TcEVI-qSg TAov7lro dv oToPEIo1LOaL; (9. 172) but it is probably right to treat this as two separate poems.' First, a parallel poem, almost certainly by Palladas, suggests that the main point is made in the first couplet: 'EAMrs Kat av', T?X-7, E'ya XatpETrE r7, AXtjV' V"pOv. o38Ev EpLt XV tF-' 'It'UETE ,ovs 'LET ' Epe. (9- 49) What works so successfully in one case would work equally successfully in another. Secondly, the second couplet is not tied to the first by any connecting particle, and though Palladas often dispenses with such links, here we might expect ycp, and without it the transition is a little abrupt. Thirdly, the first couplet is not only complete in sense but ends dramatically with the word Aqldva, and any addition rather spoils a climax which is very much in Palladas' manner. There is clearly a case for dividing the poem into two, and then what concerns us is the first half. What is the haven that Palladas has found, and how does it relieve him of any care for Hope or Luck? The two couplets in which Palladas bids farewell to 'EA-hl and T'dxq are curiously reminiscent of a theme which appears on Latin epitaphs: euasi, effugi. Spes et Fortuna, ualete, nil mihi uobiscum est, ludificate alios. (C..L. vi. 11743) actumst, excessi. Spes et Fortuna, ualete, nil iam plus in me uobis per saecla licebit. (ibid. ix. 4756) ' So Jacobs, followed by Stadtmueller and Beckby, but not by Diibner, Waltz, Paton, or Luck.</page><page sequence="10">PALLADAS ON TYCHE 127 effugi tumidam uitam. Spes, Forma, ualete, nil mihi uobiscum est. alios deludite, quaeso. (ibid. xi. 6435)' In looking at these we are tempted to think that Palladas, in taking leave of 'EArt'r and TvX-q, is writing his own epitaph. Like his two couplets, the Latin epitaphs leave the world of hope and chance to other men and regard the deliverance from it as a wonderful escape. Yet we may doubt whether this is quite what Palladas means. The image of the harbour could indeed be applied to death, as it is by him in io. 65 in the form 7rv Ka7- o 6pptov, but it can easily be applied to other forms of refuge, and there is no reason to think that it is not so applied here. That Palladas has some other idea than death in his mind receives support from an anonymous poem, which looks as if it came from his own time or a little later and develops in its rather incompetent way a variation on his theme of deliverance: 'EAi's, ,Kal a' Tt;X-q, Lya X apEEc fl?V 0`80V EvpOV" OvKETC yap rdTEcpOLS ELTrpI0opaL' E"pETE aocrW, OVVEKEV EV EIpo67mcTatL 7roAlf',avEs 4iu.,a E'crrE'. oraaa ydp arpEKEWS OVK IC EUraL, VbLES EV EjbLW OaO'para Wes- V'rfrvq  flaE E OLa -r EJOv-a.

'34) Even if this poem is not actually derived from Palladas, and it certainly looks as if it were, it makes a point so like his that we may safely regard it as evidence for what he means. Such an idea may have been current in his time, and its use by more than one poet suggests that it had some vogue. The only difference between this poem and the two distichs of Palladas is that it speaks of a 6080 while they speak of a ALrtvy. What the anonymous writer regards as a way of life, Palladas regards as a haven, and the distinction between the two is not great or very important. Both poets announce that they have escaped from the illusions and deceptions of Fortune and Hope, and while the anonymous poet stresses the positive side of this with an eye on the future, Palladas stresses the negative with an eye on the past. We may then conclude that when he speaks of having found a haven, Palladas means something psychological, a change in himself, in his outlook or his attitude or his assumptions. In comparing this deliverance implicitly with death, as Palladas seems to do, he may perhaps be exploiting an idea which he uses elsewhere. For him cer- tain conditions of life are no better than death and may justly be identified with it. Just as in the troubles of 391 he speaks of the defeated Pagans as vEKPOJV eXOvrES A8aa) rl -Oa0ppE'vas- (Io. 90. 6), so more generally he considers that the life of a poor man is itself a form of death: KaL ~'i~v ydp 8oKE'wv a; vvpS pv d 'rAas. (Io. 63. I-2) When he says good-bye to Tyche, he uses a similar language because his out- ward circumstances have not changed and may still be compared with death, ' G. Wissowa, in Roscher, Lex. Myth. iv. 1295; F. Cumont, Recherches sur le symbolisme fundraire des Romains, p. 178 n. 2; Lux Per- petua, p. 123 n. I.</page><page sequence="11">128 C. M. BOWRA but he sees the whole situation quite differently and now accepts it for the peace which he has found. We can surmise what his solution was. He often speaks of his desire for a quiet life, and though his outbursts of fury and derision were not calculated to secure it, he is obviously sincere when he speaks of it. One of his main obstacles was in himself and especially in his conviction, enforced by the conditions of his own life, that human beings are the play- things of Tyche's brutal and irrational tyranny. This he could not refrain from denouncing, if only to relieve his outraged feelings. The triumph of Christianity certainly shocked and shook him at first, but he seems to have accommodated himself to it and to have derived unexpected benefits. The first was that he ceased to be a schoolmaster, and he welcomed the liberation from a tedious and humiliating profession (9. 171). Though we do not know what source of liveli- hood he found afterwards, it may have been more congenial. Secondly, the religious strife of 391 discredited in his eyes the formidable figure of Tyche, in whose merciless omnipotence he had, despite all his scepticism, believed. The visible evidence of her ruin made him realize how foolish his belief in her had been. Once he was freed from this, he seems to have settled into a quiet mood and sought the lcpptaKov rXavx~~s- which he had always to some degree admired (Io. 46). We cannot doubt that in his own twisted way he passed through a crisis of the spirit and at the end of it found himself rid both of troubling elements in himself and of the supernatural power which had challenged and provoked them.
