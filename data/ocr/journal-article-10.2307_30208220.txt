<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Computer in Archaeology: A Critical Survey Robert Whallon, Jr. Four years ago the last general review of computer applications in archaeology was published in this journal (Chenhall, 1968). At that time, it was adequate for the author to outline three studies and mention a fourth to give a representative picture of current work in this field. Since then the situation has changed dramatically. The number and variety of computer applications in archaeology today are so great that it is virtually impossible to select any small number of individual projects as representative. Instead, entire areas of research must be covered in a general discussion, and a simple listing of current projects would probably be longer than this entire article. Archaeology is now fully in a period of experimenting with the computer and gradually adopting it as one of its major tools for research. Characteristic of this period is a healthy concern with the data and the manipulative, analytical, and statistical methods which the computer makes it possible to apply in archaeological research. Healthy, because most archaeologists have grasped the point, recently made by Chenhall (1971a:4-5), that the computer is simply a fast and powerful machine. Although it permits many previously impossible things, it cannot perform miracles on its own. A full and conscious awareness of precisely what is being done in the computer in any analysis is therefore absolutely essential for archaeologically sensible and meaningful use. The growing concern in archaeology with the new methods made possible by computers is reflected in the increasing size, frequency, and importance of sessions on analytical and statistical methods at professional meetings. Indeed, in each of the three years that have passed since Chenhall's review article in this journal, a special meeting has been held, devoted only to such problems: 1969-Marseille: International Symposium on the Application of Computers in Archaeology (Gardin, 1970). 1970-Mamaia: Anglo-Romanian Conference on Mathematics in the Archaeological and Historical Sciences (Hodson, Kendall, and Tiutu, 1971). 1971-Marseille: Seminar on the Mathematical Methods of Archaeology (In press). A shift away from concern with the computer per se towards greater interest in methods of analysis can be seen in the changing titles of these conferences. Robert Whallon, Jr., is an associate professor and Curator of the Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan. He has been a fellow of the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Research during 1971-72. 29</page><page sequence="2">30 Computers and the Humanities/Vol. 7, No. 1/September 1972 Research on or involving computers in archaeology obviously has an international character. This has developed recently. Chenhall mentioned only research by American archaeologists in his review four years ago, although by then significant work had already been going on for some time in Europe. All three conferences since 1968, however, have been held in Europe and have had international participation. Books on the subject have appeared in Russian (Kolchin and Sher, 1970) and largely in French (Gardin, 1970). International contact and communication are now virtually essential for anyone working in this field. A sharp distinction must be made here between prehistoric archaeology and classical archaeology, for computer analyses are at present being used essentially only in prehistoric archaeological research, and where the term "archaeology" is used, it will be intended to refer only to that area of research. Classical archaeology is reluctant to adopt computers or computer analysis, preferring still to rely on intuition, "feel," etc., in analysis (Burton, Bonin, Lourie, and Spiselman, 1970). The computer finds its place in this field primarily as a large data storage, sorting, and retrieval device. The problems in computer application with which classical archaeologists are usually concerned are those of uniform coding and recording for this purpose. The Computer and Archaeological Thinking Gardin, in his recent discussion of the use of computers in archaeology, says that "the use of statistical tools is not basically or even historically linked to the computerization of archaeology" (Gardin, 1971:190). Strictly speaking, this statement may be true, but it overlooks or detracts attention from a very important effect of the adoption of computers as a tool for archaeological analysis. Ideas and approaches derived from the world of computers have had a significant impact on archaeological thought and method. In the first place, the introduction of computer processing has largely influenced analysis of archaeological data by permitting more complex manipulations and statistical calculations than could ever be achieved in any other way. The applications of such multivariate statistical methods as factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis on a large scale, simulation, etc., have become possible recently only through the use of the computer. Added to the possibilities offered for handling vast amounts of data or repeating certain statistical calculations innumerably in a short time, these techniques have served to open the archaeologist's mind to whole new avenues of research. Equally or more important, moreover, is the need created for clarity and logical precision: definitions must be complete and consistent, operations to be carried out on the data must be objectively and precisely specified, and the logic of the algorithm guiding the course of analysis must be explicit and unambiguous. Such requirements lead or force archaeologists into new manners of thinking, often in symbolic terms. This, in turn, frequently leads to newer ideas for analysis or even to reconsideration of theory. The process is thus to a certain extent cumulative, and the use of a computer and of statistics almost inevitably breeds further use. Computer applications and quantitative data analysis, therefore, through their rigorous but virtually unlimited nature and their engendering of new modes of thought, are leaving their undeniable and distinctive mark on archaeology. This should not be a completely unexpected development. There is, in any field, a great deal of feedback from technique to theory and method. It is, in fact, impossible to separate them at many points. On the other hand, theory and method in archaeology are also often explicitly derived from an anthropological frame of reference. The new modes of thought generated by precise, quantitative, computer analysis in archaeology therefore have to be coordinated with those derived from anthropology. In most cases there is an active</page><page sequence="3">Whallon/Arcbaeology 31 interplay between the thinking and the directions of research coming from each of these sources. This eclecticism and the interplay among theories, ideas, and methods pulled together from diverse origins, in fact, make archaeology intellectually an exciting field at the moment. But the danger of overemphasis on one or another of these approaches does exist. It is particularly strong in the case of computer applications and statistics, and examples can be found of inadequate consideration for anthropological principles in the application of these methods. At their best, however, computers and statistics are invaluable assets in the archaeologist's set of tools for research. Descriptive Statistics and Data Organization One of the simplest yet most important uses of the computer in archaeology is the generation of descriptive statistics and the manipulation of quantities of data too large to be easily managed by hand. That there are as yet relatively few examples of extensive computer applications of this sort in the literature is probably more a weakness of general analytic approach and method in archaeological research than an indication of the usefulness of the computer in this area. The computer has now made many varieties of data organization and the generation of histograms, cross-plots, and descriptive statistics tremendously easy and fast. The production of summary tables, histograms, cross-plots, and the calculation of various parameters of frequency distributions, measures of association and correlation are all potentially informative and useful preliminary steps in data analysis and interpreta- tion. Little theoretical or empirical work has been done on the application of these procedures in archaeology, although a start has been made in this direction (Cowgill, 1970). More will undoubtedly be done in the future. Although unfortunately not yet routine or universal, the preliminary study of basic descriptive statistics, histograms, and plots is potentially one of the most informative phases of archaeological data analysis, and should be customary as a preliminary to any further and more complex analysis. Most projects which involve analysis by correlation or classification proceed directly from the raw data, skipping the preliminary step of data organization and inspection. Such a procedure may be in several ways extremely misleading in analysis, making all of these studies potentially suspect. Seriation Seriation is one of the extremely few quantitative analytical methods used in archaeology which can be said to have been developed by archaeologists within their own field for strictly archaeological application. The theory and practice of seriation go back into the late nineteenth century, and quantitative approaches are over ten years old (Robinson, 1951; Brainerd, 1951). Up to and including the year in which Chenhall published his review (1968), no fewer than four computer algorithms for seriation of archaeological and anthropological data had appeared in print (Ascher and Ascher, 1963; Kuzara, Mead, and Dixon, 1966; Hole and Shaw, 1967; Craytor and Johnson, 1968). Suddenly, however, in the last two to three years, there has been a veritable explosion in the number of articles and papers on seriation. Only a few of these contributions now come from archaeologists (e.g., Renfrew and Sterud, 1969; Dunnell, 1970; Cowgill, n.d.a; Irwin, 1971; Goldmann, 1971). The rest have been made by statisticians and mathematicians who have found in seriation a new, for them somewhat unusual, and intriguing problem amenable to precise mathematical or statistical formulation and solution. Their interest in seriation was presaged almost ten years ago in a little-known article by D.G. Kendall (1963). An interval of six years passed, however, with no more apparent interest on the part of the statisticians during which the</page><page sequence="4">32 Computers and the Humanities/Vol. 7, No. 1/September 1972 archaeologists continued with their slow pursuit of more precise and objective methods. Then the flood of articles began (Kendall, 1969a; 1969b; 1971a; 1971b; Gelfand, 1971a). At the conference in Mamaia there were no fewer than eight major papers on archaeological seriation, of which six were by statisticians (Kendall, 1971c; Gelfand, 1971b; Wilkinson, 1971; Sibson, 1971a; Landau and de la Vega, 1971; Kivu-Sculy, 1971). The trend has continued with papers at recent meetings at Marseille and Sheffield (de la Vega, 1972a; 1972b; n.d.; R6gnier, 1972; Lerman, 1972a). Most of these papers attack the subject theoretically. A number of them, however, present practical algorithms for archaeological seriation, and some are devoted specifically to the development of methods, most of which have been tested and had their use demonstrated on archaeological data. As a result the archaeologist is now faced with a significant series of highly technical mathematical and statistical papers on a method which is of central importance to his field. On the other hand, he is simultaneously presented with a new series of algorithms and computer programs with which to seriate his data. Not readily mastering the first series of contributions, or even being totally awed and overwhelmed by them, he seldom knows on what criteria to base his selection of one program over another. The final choice is often a product of chance, convenience, availability, or the like, but not intrinsically related to the selected algorithm itself. This situation, brought on by very rapid recent change, will undoubtedly soon straighten out. Computers running various programs all over the world are now probably turning out hundreds of seriations a year. Some archaeologists have made a start in comprehending, if not mastering, the mathematical and statistical arguments upon which the various algorithms have been built. Finally, the subject of seriation itself is of comparatively little mathematical complexity and is likely to be more or less exhausted by mathematicians and statisticians within a short time. We will soon be in a position to quickly and consciously select the proper program to seriate either presence/absence, relative frequency, or Brainerd-Robinson type matrices so as to achieve an optimal ordering given one or two specific criteria. The theory and method of seriation probably have, in a sense, already been brought to a level of precision and refinement significantly superior to that inherent in the data which most archaeologists have to seriate. This has happened in a couple of years, thanks to the sudden interest among statisticians and mathematicians. In the near future, then, one can expect a decline in theoretical and methodological activity in this field. There will be a gradual distribution to archaeologists of a number of computer programs which will be more than adequate for the archaeological tasks at hand. Interest in this area will dissipate in two directions: first, in the direction of multidimensional scaling and classification, to which seriation is related as a sort of ultimately simplified version; second, in the archaeological direction of a better understanding of the nature of our data. Accurate and knowledgeable selection of attributes or characteristics will more specifically reflect single factors (time, in the case of seriation) which have formed the data as we find it. Classification and Scaling Classification is easily the most important, most worked-on subject in archaeology. This emphasis carries over naturally into computer applications in the field. Both archaeologists and mathematicians/statisticians are active in this area. The former borrow and the latter bring with them a myriad of methods largely developed in and for other areas of research, largely the biological sciences. "Classificatory methods," an open-ended area of research, grades on all sides into areas which are often designated as independent research domains in themselves, such as</page><page sequence="5">Whallon/Arcbaeology 33 seriation, factor analysis, and multidimensional scaling. There is a core of cluster analytic procedures which one might call the central or "real" area of work on methods of classification, but it is really almost impossible to find a sharp line which isolates cluster analysis from a whole series of other approaches to the same problem. Therefore it is possible to give only a brief overview of this extensive area of computer applications in archaeology, given the emphasis on this field, the multiplicity of methods applied in it, and the amount of work currently being done there. In addition, much of the work reported in newsletters, at meetings, or in correspondence either is slow to appear in print or is not published at all, making the representation in the literature of computer analyses in this area disproportionately low with respect to the actual activity going on. A possible explanation for this phenomenon may be the relative lack of practical success of statistical classification in archaeological applications, partially related, perhaps, to the lack of concern with the basic questions about the nature of archaeological classifications and the single-mindedness of approach which have generally been characteristic of this area of work until now. These problems are briefly discussed below. The most specifically classificatory algorithms now being extensively tested and applied in archaeology are those for various kinds of cluster analysis, largely following the procedures assembled and described by Sokol and Sneath (1963). All of these methods are basically polythetic and agglomerative, as discussed by Williams and Dale (1965). All require the use of a computer for more than insignificantly small sets of data. Explorations of the applicability and usefulness of these methods in archaeology began a half-dozen years ago (Hodson, Sneath, and Doran, 1966), and rapidly increasing numbers of such studies and applications have appeared recently in the literature (Hodson, 1969; 1970; 1971; Bordaz and Bordaz, 1970; True and Matson, 1970; Thomas, 1972). In terms of current research, work with cluster analytic methods is one of the most active areas. For example, it is by far the most commonly mentioned analysis in the list of computer applications at the University of Arizona tabulated below. In almost every case archaeologists are borrowing from and experimenting with the almost limitless range of methods and computer algorithms produced in other fields. One slight exception is Groube's (n.d.) work in which the archaeologist tries specifically to create a coefficient with archaeologically desirable characteristics. Cluster analysis and classification is another area of statistical work in archaeology where mathematicians and statisticians have recently taken a large interest. A significant number of papers is thus rapidly accumulating in the archaeological literature on the theory and mathematical bases of classification (e.g. Lerman, 1970; 1971; 1972b; de la Vega, 1970; Rdgnier, 1970; Ihm, 1970; Jaulin, 1970; Sibson, 1971b; Solomon, 1971; Achard, 1972). Research in this area has quickly branched out in many directions, investigating a wide range of techniques, not only for classification, but quite frequently for ordering or scaling of items in two or more dimensions in the search for structure in archaeological data. The most common direction taken has been to experiment with multidimensional scaling. Indeed, a section of the Mamaia conference was explicitly devoted to "Multidimensional Scaling and Related Procedures" (Hodson, Kendall, and Thutu, 1971). Basically the same data, the same starting point, is used as in cluster analysis, namely a matrix of similarity or distance coefficients between all pairs of items in the data set. One then attempts to order the items in a 2-, 3-, or (rarely) more-dimensional space so as best to preserve all the distances between all pairs of items as specified in the original matrix. The process is an iterative one and is normally dependent on computer processing. Applications of multidimensional scaling procedures also began to appear in the literature a half-dozen years ago (Hodson, Sneath, and Doran, 1966; Doran and Hodson, 1966), but interest has surged only in the last couple of years (e.g., Hodson,</page><page sequence="6">34 Computers and the Humanities/Vol. 7, No. 1/September 1972 1970; True and Matson, 1970; Ammerman, 1971). In some ways, multidimensional scaling is closely related to seriation. Seriation is in a sense a scaling procedure reduced to the minimum number of dimensions. It is therefore not unusual to see some moderate-to-strong linearity in the configurations produced by multidimensional scaling of archaeological data and to find that Kendall (1971b; 1971c) and Cowgill (n.d.a) advocate a combined application of multidimensional scaling and seriation techniques to achieve optimum chronological ordering of one's data. Seriation techniques have also occasionally simply been used to order a matrix of coefficients which are then shaded according to their strength in an effort to discern clusters of items (Johnson, 1968). Since the attributes by which archaeological materials are described almost never have a single, simple meaning, Kruskal (1971) warns that "time is not the only dimension." Multidimensional scaling, in contrast to seriation as a technique for data ordering and display for archaeological interpretation, would seem to have many useful future applications. An apparently related or similar statistical technique is the Guttman-Lingoes smallest space analysis (Lingoes, 1970). Extensive statistical work has been done in the creation of a series of programs for this sort of analysis which may be potentially useful in archaeology but which has only just begun to be proposed and applied. Ordination, or plotting of items against principal components extracted from the matrix of correlations among attributes, is another technique for displaying the relationships among a series of items under study. Analytically quite different from any sort of scaling program and complex so as to require the use of a computer, it has recently occasionally been applied in archaeology (Hodson, 1970). A closely related method has been developed by Borillo and Ihm specifically for display, and ultimately for classification, of archaeological data in which missing elements are a significant problem (Borillo and Ihm, 1971). Surprisingly, these approaches have not been widely applied in archaeology. Their greater conceptual and mathematical complexity, in contrast to scaling methods, makes them less accessible to the average archaeologist, but their decided analytical advantages in certain situations will probably increase their future use. Recently there have also been a few isolated examples of other methods of classification utilizing the computer for complex and voluminous calculations. A straightforward Q-mode factor analysis has been used by Rowlett and Pollnac (1971) to classify archaeological sites. Graham (1970) has plotted groups of handaxes against canonical variates. A few more examples of relatively unusual classification methods could be culled from the literature, but they are not likely to become of very general importance in the field. Interest will, for the next few years at least, probably remain concentrated on methods of cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling, with applications of factor or principal components analysis perhaps slightly increasing in frequency. Almost all of the recent and extensive work in this field of statistical or computer classification in archaeology has consisted simply of borrowing methods, applying them to some body of data, and considering the results. The statisticians have been largely concerned with the mathematical properties of the methods themselves. There has been, with certain rare exceptions (e.g., Borillo, 1970; n.d.; Whallon, 1972), virtually no consideration of the essential nature, or natures, of archaeological classification itself with the intention of elaborating quantitative methods and models which would conform explicitly to archaeological principles of classification. In other words, there has been insufficient or inadequate attention to Gardin's (1971:190) first question of sampling, "do the nature and extent of the 'populations' studied . . . justify the use of a particular statistical tool?" In one instance where an attempt in this direction was made (Whallon, 1971; 1972), it was concluded that a completely different kind of classificatory approach, a monothetic and subdivisive one, was probably more appropriate than the</page><page sequence="7">Whallon/Arcbaeology 35 standard polythetic agglomerative or scaling approaches. The specific purpose was to create a stylistic typology of ceramics, based on discrete attributes of morphology and design, which would reflect chronology. Monothetic divisive methods of classification have very seldom been considered in archaeology. A recent treatment of the problem (Thomas, 1972) argues that archae- ological classifications must be polythetic but that monothetic keys are necessary for identification and assignment of specimens to groups. The argument is illustrated with a classification of projectile points, based largely on measurements, but again reflecting chronology. Much could be said about this argument, which appears to contain some obvious logical and methodological inconsistencies. What is interesting and important in this context, however, is that it illustrates the degree to which the matching of appropriate classificatory algorithms to particular archaeological requirements or materials is hindered by a still prevalent single-mindedness of approach to problems of classification in the field. The author maintains, even though the results of his research lead him to create a monothetic subdivisive key for typing his material, that archaeological classifications are polythetic. Without actually testing any classification to confirm or reject this position, he accepts a number of statements from the literature as indicative of the essential polythetic character of traditional typology. As a result, there is a clear conflict between Thomas' theoretical position and the activities required to achieve meaningful results with his material. Nowhere does he admit the possibility that there might be more than one kind of "archaeological classification" and that some classifications might necessarily be monothetic while others are indeed basically polythetic. Both archaeologists and statisticians are, as a general rule, developing classificatory methods as though they were facing a single problem. In reality, they probably face numerous different kinds of classificatory problems, and some explicit attention is urgently needed for the identification and definition of these different problems so that individual and undoubtedly different solutions can be found for them. It is risky to continue to argue about the relative merits of even such grossly different approaches as polythetic vs. monothetic classification without making clear 1) the nature of the data, 2) the nature of the attributes used to describe or characterize the data, and 3) the nature and supposed meaning of the desired classification. Any classificatory procedure applied to the data ought, then, to be related in some explicit manner to each of these points. In most current work, all this is glossed over or ignored. The task of establishing classificatory systems is essentially one for the archae- ologist. Statisticians and mathematicians can be of little or no help here, and the archaeologist must often take some care to avoid undue influence of statistical considerations in what are usually exclusively archaeological and anthropological questions. The problem begins with the archaeologist's selection of data and definition of attributes. One of the weakest points in archaeology as a "science" is that we are unable to define precisely what the important data are in many important areas of research and we are frequently unable to state clearly on theoretical (and often even on empirical) grounds why the particular attributes or items of data that we record are significant or exactly what they mean, relate to, or signify. Recent work on such fundamental questions relating to flaked stone tools (Speth, 1972), for example, has shown that there is sometimes a striking amount of redundancy in much of our measuring and recording. One can generally predict, then, that the present emphasis and degree of activity in the area of computer classification in archaeology will continue or increase. To the extent that such methods become more refined and widely applied, however, the above problems of discrimination between different kinds of data, attributes, and classification will become more pressing. More and more, they will have to be faced squarely by the anthropologically oriented archaeologist. They are among the fundamental problems in the field.</page><page sequence="8">36 Computers and the Humanities/Vol. 7, No. 1/September 1972 Data Banks Archaeology, more than many other sciences, has accumulated vast quantities of data over the years and continues to do so at an ever-increasing rate. A number of archaeologists have become concerned with the growing problems of access to, and control over, such large amounts of information. Following hard on the heels of workers in related areas such as museum organization and cataloging, they have begun to consider the problems of organization of archaeological data banks and to create some large, permanent files of archaeological data. Leading the activity in this area is Robert G. Chenhall of the Arkansas Archeological Survey (Chenhall, 1971a; 1971b; n.d.). In May 1971 an Archaeological Data Bank Conference was held at the University of Arkansas, attended by 45 persons including archaeologists from six countries (Chenhall, 1971c). Recent developments outside archaeology have produced a variety of computer softwear (programs) for data banking, at least two of which are appropriate or adaptable for use with archaeological data. Archaeologists interested in this area of work can now concentrate on the crucial problems, determining categories of information to be recorded in such a data bank and developing a standard system and terminology for expressing the information to be coded. These two questions, what to record and how to express it, are of the utmost importance in the creation of any large file of archaeological information. Chenhall (1971b: 163) has made the point clearly "... we have to store the data now so that sometime in the future [the archaeologist] will be able to find what he thinks he needs. Unless this is achieved, the system will not be used." A seven-man committee including representatives from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Denmark was formed at the Archaeological Data Bank Conference to work on these points (Chenhall, 1971). To show the way, the Arkansas Archeological Survey has already largely worked out its own format (system of "annotation classes") and "thesauri" for the recording of all archaeological data from that state (Chenhall, 1971a: 10-18, 33-45; 1971b: 163-68). Data banks such as that of the Arkansas Archeological Survey and those envisaged by the Archaeological Data Bank Conference may be called "general-purpose" data files or perhaps most accurately "data catalogs." They can be contrasted to the more usual, smaller, and more specific files of data which are constantly being created by archaeologists for particular studies or analyses, and which normally contain much more detailed information on a relatively limited set of variables than do "general-purpose" data banks. This information is also usually more rigorously defined and coded in special ways, dependent upon the particular exigencies of the intended analysis. The largest and most intricate of such specific-purpose data files is probably that compiled by George L. Cowgill containing the data from the huge Teotihuacan Mapping Project (Cowgill, 1967; 1968; n.d.b). Here a data file, comprising upwards of 5,000 observation units and one million objects, has not only allowed valuable and informative analyses of the data itself but has also provided appropriate data for testing the application of certain statistical methods in general (e.g., Cowgill, 1970). The creation of special-purpose data files and concern with how they should be structured are not new or uniquely a result of computer use or the use of statistical analysis in the field. Adoption both of the computer and of statistical methods of analysis, however, has tremendously increased the number of such data files. There has been a slight concomitant increase in the attention given by archaeologists to the structuring of the coding systems for such files. The kind of data encoded in these files is often simple enough that relatively little concern with coding as such is necessary. Frequently, however, it is useful or even necessary to consider problems of coding explicitly. Leading in this field is probably the Centre d'Analyse Documentaire pour l'Archdologie (C.A.D.A.) in Marseille (and now also Paris), which has a tradition of research in problems of description and coding going back at least to 1955 (Gardin, 1955; 1967; cf. review in Gardin, 1971; Borillo, 1971;</page><page sequence="9">Whallon/Arcbaeology 37 Chouraqui, 1972; Virbel n.d.). Although earlier work by this group was oriented toward methods of data recording and processing other than with the computer, it turned to computer processing as soon as the new technology was available. The emphasis has always been the same, on the formal, logical principles according to which rigorous, scientifically and analytically adequate systems of description and coding must be constructed. Others have been in contact with this group on the same subject (e.g., Rogers, 1970). In addition to theoretical work, the C.A.D.A. has also produced a number of codes and data files for practical use in analysis. Gardin (1967:18) lists two for archaeological materials and several more for iconography and architecture. Borillo (1971:26-27) lists about six codes for archaeological data and several others for literary, iconographical, and architectural applications. In the work of the group from the C.A.D.A., questions of description and coding of data for filing are intimately related to analytical considerations. As seems to be true for all "specific-purpose" data banks, this link serves to distinguish these data files from "general-purpose" ones, whose main body of information consists of those "many categories of data [which] are regularly recorded as a part of almost every archaeological survey or excavation" (Chenhall, n.d.). In the attempt to plan or assess the future of data banking in archaeology, the distinction is critical. In spite of their conviction that computerized archaeological data banks are essential because of the volume of data to be processed (Chenhall, 1971b; n.d.) and their condemnation of the current state of the discipline which hinders the development of data banks and thus the progress of archaeology to a true science (Gardin, 1971; 197-98; Chenhall, n.d.), proponents of archaeological data banks must still admit both that it is hard to achieve any uniformity of opinion on what information should be included or to know to what future use the data will be put (Chenhall, 1971a: 40,52) and that any artificial descriptive code cannot be universal or unique (Gardin, 1967:27). "General- purpose" data banks and "specific-purpose" data banks will therefore not normally be very compatible. The currently suggested solution to this problem is to incorporate all specific-purpose codings in the general-purpose bank, letting the number of descriptor classes go up to the maximum acceptable one million, if necessary (Chenhall, n.d.). This ad hoc solution probably will not prove suitable in the long run. If archaeology continues to progress as a science, it will inevitably lead to the analysis and re-analysis of data in new ways, often requiring the measurement or observation of different variables or attributes of the same data. Quite frequently the same "variable" may be measured in different ways. In a recent study, for example, "two different length measurements were made on each flake (maximum length and 'percussion axis' length) and more than a half-dozen different thicknessess were determined" (Speth, 1972:48). The result of combining lists of variables like this, one after another in a single data bank will be an increasingly lengthy, massive, and complex catalog of "annotation classes" and descriptors for the data bank, many of whose classes or descriptors will partially overlap or will be contradictory. The entire catalog and the "thesauri" of descriptors will thus have to be reorganized virtually every time a significant addition of "specific-purpose" data is made to the file. It is easy to foresee that the neat and logical structure of catalogs now in use for data banking (e.g., Chenhall, 1971a:11-16) will eventually break down. Catalogs and thesauri will become too large, unwieldy, complex, and internally inconsistent for effective and efficient use in analysis long before they will have reached their theoretical maximum of one million categories. There is another point of caution concerning the future of data banking in archaeology. Proponents of data banking often stress its scientific desirability or necessity and point out that one of the great hindrances to the expansion of data banking is the unscientific lack of "agreement among specialists as to the nature of the data: the choice of corpus.., . and the choice of descriptive language... " (Gardin, 1971:198). This is of</page><page sequence="10">38 Computers and the Humanities/Vol. 7, No. 1/September 1972 course true, but it is also true that archaeology as a scientific discipline is an infant, and precisely one of the most critical areas of growth must now be that of questioning, experimenting with, defining, and redefining what "the nature of the data" is in our field. While the problem has been touched on above in discussing studies of classification in archaeology, it is important to note again here that some of the most innovative, stimulating, and "scientific" research recently and currently being done concerns the nature of our da-a (Borillo, 1970; n.d.; Whallon, 1972) and even of the variables we measure (Speth, 1972). Archaeology is not yet sufficiently scientific to establish any immutable variables, attributes, or classes in our data other than perhaps some very simple ones, useful more for cataloging than for analysis. A possible danger of data banking done too soon and on too all-encompassing a scale is that it is not likely to prove particularly useful to innovative, experimentative, and exploratory researches and may actually tend to stifle active questioning and thought about the basic nature and meaning of the units of data, variables, and attributes which we use in our work. Every effort should be made to guard against such a tendency if we want our infant discipline to continue to grow towards a mature scientific field. The present view suggests that computerized data banks should slowly grow in size, number, and importance in archaeology in the next few years. One might venture to predict that they will find their primary and most useful application as cataloging systems with a minimum of detailed descriptive information. As such they will be more and more extensively used by archaeologists to find the data they want for particular researches. The actual analysis of data will probably continue, on the whole, to be carried out with smaller, specialized data files containing information on certain variables and attributes measured and coded in certain ways, all specific to the problem at hand. The distinction between general-purpose and special-purpose data banks will almost certainly be maintained at least in the near future. Simulation The application of computer simulation techniques to the modeling of archaeolog- ical situations is one of the newest developments in computer use in archaeology. Only four years ago the word simulation did not even appear in the index to Clarke's (1968) major book Analytical Archaeology. Recent articles (Doran, 1970; 1972; Bourrelly, 1972) and communications at meetings (Doran, n.d.) have discussed and propounded the potential usefulness of this technique; although apparently no actual simulation study has yet appeared in the archaeological literature, one is currently in press (Wobst, n.d.). This technique offers an attractive approach to model building and testing as archaeologists begin to think more in terms of systems and systems theory (Binford, 1962; 1965; 1968; Flannery, 1968). As archaeological explanation becomes more a matter of defining the relevant variables involved in any given phenomenon or process and of specifying the systemic interrelationships among those variables, simulation provides a new and unique means to experimentally recreate the proposed explanatory system and to test its behavior under an entire range of possible situations. The techniques and procedures of computer simulation so closely parallel the current thinking and processes of model- building of many archaeologists that the lateness and limits of their application are surprising. The major obstacle to the application of simulation methods to archaeological problems has probably been the great difficulty with which parameters and variables in any hypothesized prehistoric system can be measured or estimated from archaeological data. Certain archaeologists now working in this direction are producing as quantitative models the first steps of a real simulation model (e.g., Zubrowv, 1971). Such quantified</page><page sequence="11">Whallon/Arcbaeology 39 models may, and very likely will, be activated and transformed into simulations of model behavior simply by specifying ranges of variability and probabilities for various parameter states and letting the system then work itself out under different conditions and constraints. In the one example of real simulation modeling which is in press (Wobst, n.d.), Monte Carlo methods of simulation were applied to a population model for Paleolithic human populations. The results of statistical geography were utilized in building a model of the spatial distributions of units of a population. With available data from physical anthropology, initial estimates were obtained of mortality rates in hunting-gathering populations. Ethnographic data were extensively relied on for a preliminary model of the social and ecological systems to be simulated. These data were built into a generalized model of a dynamic population, which was distributed within a defined territory in which members were born, moved, married, and died, all according to precisely defined probabilities and possibilities. Simulations were run of the behavior of this model population over periods of from 100 to 500 years. In most cases, the system fluctuated randomly as it slowly settled into a relative equilibrium representing the outcome of the mutual interplay of all the parameter specifications and constraints imposed in that particular case. In this way the necessary minimal equilibrium size and the minimal band size of such populations could be studied, specified, and in a sense explained. The effects of such cultural rules as band exogamy and incest were displayed through simulation. Interesting patterns of differential population distribution were generated simply as a result of the working out of births, deaths, aging, and movement for marriage. Almost none of the above phenomena could have been studied from archaeological data with standard archaeological methods, yet a great deal of the simulation bears directly on the interpretation of many of the findings of archaeology as to group sizes and population distribution. The result has been to suggest interesting and potentially informative approaches for future fieldwork. Interest and activity in archaeological computer simulation are at the moment concentrated primarily in the United States but are starting to spread to Europe. Although research has only just begun on computer simulation, it can probably be safely predicted that, because of its real suitability to many of the current problems of archaeology and for working within a systemic frame of reference, it will be one of the burgeoning fields of activity in archaeological analysis in the next few years. Miscellaneous This is in some ways the largest category of computer applications in archaeology. A measure of the degree to which the computer has been adopted as a research tool is that we cannot even begin to present here a complete list of its manifold uses outside those general areas already discussed above. Here, particularly in these special, unusual, and sometimes uniquely archaeological applications, standard, "canned" programs are not available, and more and more archaeologists are learning to write and run their own computer programs in the course of their research. One of the most characteristically archaeological of these uses is the generation and printing of stratigraphic backplots of artifacts and other items in a site. Special programs which have been written for this (Bourrelly, n.d.; also at the University of Michigan, cf. Science 171:1120) can select any width of section within which to backplot, from any specific position on the site, and oriented at any angle. Archaeological materials which have been recorded in three dimensions may then be plotted with distinguishing symbols for different kinds of items. Horizontal plotting and mapping, also being performed more frequently by computer now, are often simple enough to be programmed by the archaeologist himself. Sometimes, however, more complex programs are used for data sorting and final mapping by CALCOMP plotter (McNett, Kraly, and Gardner, n.d.), and even more complex contour and density maps have been produced with such programs as</page><page sequence="12">40 Computers and the Humanities/Vol. 7, No. 1/September 1972 SYMAP (Redman and Watson, 1970). The statistical analysis of pattern in such horizontal distributions is another area to which some attention is now being given, with nearest-neighbor analysis the most frequently adopted method (e.g., at the University of Michigan, Whallon, Wright, personal communication; Arizona State University, G.A. Clark, personal communication). Programs for the basic nearest-neighbor statistics to detect randomness/non-randomness of distribution are fairly easy to construct, and several are now running; the further procedures of areal cluster definition and comparisons among distributions, though a preliminary program has been developed at Michigan, are more difficult. In addition to nearest-neighbor analysis, which requires coordinate data, another method is now also programmed and available for the analysis of spatial pattern in materials collected within grid squares (Whallon, n.d.). Also dealing with spatial patterns, but of a very different sort, has been the work done on the analysis and presentation by computer of the results of geomagnetic surveys in archaeology (e.g., Linington, 1970; Scollar, 1969; 1970). Here the data are "filtered" and plotted, Fourier transforms are used, and isometric views are constructed by computer. In a number of places, pollen analysis is now being aided by the computer, either to compile and print the pollen profiles (e.g., at the University of Amsterdam, A. Voorrips, personal communication) or to perform statistical analysis of pollen data in the search for significant homogeneities or correlations among pollen spectra (e.g., at Arizona State University, J. Schoenwetter, personal communication). Rather special uses of the computer in archaeology include Speth's (1972:Fig. 9) generating from complex formulas the curves relating critical factors which condition flint flaking, and his development of a program for dissecting bimodal frequency distributions, also useful in his study of the mechanics of flaking stone tools (personal communication). The list above could be expanded, but it seems adequate to give at least an idea of the range of diversity of computer applications in archaeology and the degree to which current archaeological research, above and beyond the main areas of activity previously discussed, is becoming dependent upon the computer. It remains to be mentioned that, while most archaeologists come to the computer, the computer has at least once come to the archaeologists. In the summer of 1971, the Arizona State University Summer Field School in Archaeology used a remote terminal to record and perform preliminary day-by-day analysis of archaeological data while excavating. Although the results were apparently encouraging, it was noted that such intrusion of the computer in the field would eventually require modifications in standard archaeological field practice (Newsletter of Computer Archaeology, September 1971). This influence of the computer in basic archaeological procedure may ultimately prove beneficial in some situations. Condusion This review, brief and incomplete as it is, should nonetheless give some indication of the tremendous expansion of computer use in archaeology since the last review of the subject four years ago in this journal. Impressionistically, the most frequent and important uses of the computer in the day-to-day archaeological research at the University of Michigan are in the area of data manipulation and simple descriptive statistics, sorting, counting, frequency distributions, cross-plots, parameters of distribu- tions, associations and correlations, and so on. Problems of classification run a close second. In the literature the balance seems, again impressionistically, to be towards a majority of applications in problems of classification, followed by seriation and multidimensional scaling. A quantitative estimate of the frequencies of different types of archaeological computer use at the University of Arizona can be obtained by counting the number of times they are mentioned in the latest list of archaeological projects completed and under way (Use of the University of Arizona CDc 6400 in Anthropology, March</page><page sequence="13">Whallon/A rcbaeology 41 1972, listing from the University of Arizona Department of Anthropology): Cluster analysis 13 Factor analysis 7 Tabulation 5 Horizontal and vertical artifact plots 2 Simulation 2 Seriation 1 Regression 1 Discriminant analysis 1 Sampling 1 Pollen analysis 1 The creation of a large data bank is to begin soon. Although certain areas tend to emerge as important, classification for example, there is no obvious uniformity among institutions or archaeologists as to the emphases in computer applications in their field. Archaeology seems to be in the full throes of experimentation, or what Chenhall (1968:23) has called letting "our imaginations go to work in the creation of new research designs." For the future, then, the area in which archaeology must make the most progress is that of defining precisely what statistical and other analytic methods are appropriate for particular archaeological problems and data. Although many methods will be shared with other fields of research, such progress will also involve the development of methods which are specifically designed for archaeological application. This latter development is bound to come in archaeology just as it has in all other fields which have developed a quantitative and analytic approach. In such fields as sociology, psychology, biology, ecology, and geography, specialists have gradually emerged whose particular concern was analytic methodology within the field and who progressed from the stage of borrowing and adapting methods from other fields to the creation of truly new methods for their discipline. To these specialists we owe such methods as factor analysis, cluster analysis, and the analysis of spatial patterns. Archaeology is now fully in the stage of borrowing, experimenting, and adapting. Even the "newest" methods, just appearing in the literature or in press, for classification, simulation, spatial analysis, etc. are all basically taken over from other fields within which they were developed. The one method which may be said to be an archaeological creation is that of seriation. As mentioned above, this important, if not vital, analytical tool has been developed to a high level of theoretical and practical perfection. The process was begun by archaeologists but continued by statisticians and mathematicians. Archaeology cannot, however, in the long run continue to depend on statisticians and mathematicians from outside the field for the proper definition and development of methods specifically appropriate and applicable to archaeological analysis. Archaeology as a discipline has not yet brought forth its group of adequately trained specialists in the analysis of its quantiative data. The emergence of such a group of archaeologists who are competent in this area of research, however, is a development to be expected in the relatively near future. The computer has virtually come of age in archaeology. Archaeology must now come of age in the area of computerized data analysis.
