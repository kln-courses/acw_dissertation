<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVOLUTION OF THE NARASIMHA LEGEND AND ITS POSSIBLE SOURCES Suvira Jaiswal {New Delhi) Although it is well known that the Puranas contain divergent accounts of myths and traditions, hardly any effort has been made so far to study these variations with a view to trace their possible origin and significance in the context of the general development of Indian religion and history. However, if one gets over the common bias of regarding Puranic legends as mean- ingless accretions of a thought pattern totally unrelated to realities, it is possible to find in them interesting clues to a proper understanding of the processes of social and cultural change in India. The present paper is an attempt to demonstrate through a comparative and analytical study of the legends of the Man-Lion (Narasimha) incarnation of Visnu how realities of the past have given rise to new myths, which have become stereotyped and conventional in course of time. Vedic literature contains no reference to a deity having the form of lion or half-man and half-lion. The solitary exception, the last book of the Taittrriya Aranyaka , is evidently a later composition written some time in the early centuries of the Christian era long after the close of the Vedic period.1 The passage does not show clearly if the god is considered identi- cal with Visnu but the juxtaposition of the invocation addressed to Narasimha with that of Vasudeva- Visnu is certainly suggestive of an intimate alliance if not complete identification of the two cults. The Mahabharata speaks of him as an incarnation of Visnu at several plaćes2 but an exposition of the exploits of this incarnation is given for the first time in the Harivamsa Purana which is a supplement to the Mahabharata and is generally placed around A.D. 400. The accounts given iń the Harivamsa ? the Matsya 4 and the Padma 5 Puranas are almost identical in language and content, and evidently derived from the same source. It is narrated that the demon king Hiranyakasipu practised severe austerities for 1 1 ,000 years and obtained a boon from Brahma that he would be invulnerable from men or beasts, would not be killed by any weapon nor would he die during the day or night. Armed with this boon he began to harass the Devas and deprived them of their 140</page><page sequence="2">141 share in the sacrificial offerings. The Devas prayed to Narayana-Visnu who promised them to kill the demon. Accordingly he assumed the half-man and half-lion form of Narasimha and took the personified Omkara as his assistant. With his assistance Visnu went to the beautiful assembly hall ( sabba ) of Hiranyakasipu. He saw the demon-king being waited upon by thousands of celestial nymphs and the Daityas such as Bali, Narakasura and Prahlada. When Prahlada saw the deity, owing to his supernatural vision, he immediately realised that it was not a lion but the supreme deity who had the entire universe within him, and he had come to annihilate the Daityas. Prahlada expressed this opinion^to his father. But Hiranyakasipu on hearing the words of Prahlada ordered the Danavas to capture the lion and in case of there being any difficulty kill it outright. Thereupon a terrible fight between the demons and Narasimha ensued. Finally, Narasimha supported by Omkara killed the demon Hiranyakasipu with his nails. The devas and sages praised him for the feat and Brahma recited a eulogy in his honour. Afterwards, Visnu went to the northern coast of the Ksirabdi ocean, established his Narasimha form there, and returned to his residing place in his old form. It is significant to note that in this narrative there is no mention of Narasimha's coming out of a pillar, he enters the assembly hall assisted by Omkara in full view of all the demons including Prahlada and Hiranya- kasipu, and although Prahlada recognises Visnu 'hidden within Narasimha' and as one who has the whole of the three worlds within him, there is no specific mention of his devotion to the deity ; like other demons of Hiran- yakasipu's court he is also surprised and expresses the foreboding to his father that this strange form has came to destroy the Daityas. But there is no suggestion of his having been threatened by Hiranyakasipu and Narasimha's coming to his rescue. The Kurma Purana version® of the account differs in substantial details from the above mentioned one, but the Kurma also does not speak of Narasimha's appearance from a pillar. According to this Purana Visuu at first created a Purusa and sent him to kill Hiranyakasipu, but Prahlada along with Hiranyakasipu fought against this purusa, who was defeated and went back to Visnu. Visnu assumed the Narasimha form and appea- red suddenly in the city of Hiranyakasipu.7 At first Prahlada fought him in obedience to his father's command, but he was defeated and he accepted the eternity and universality of Vasudeva (Visnu), Prahlada began to eulogise him and tried to dissuade Hiranyakasipu, his brother Hiranyaksa and other demons from fighting against Visnu. But Hiranyakasipu did ņot listen to him and hence was killed by Narasimha. Anuhlada and other</page><page sequence="3">142 sons of Hiranyakasipu were killed by the lions born of the body of Narasimha8. It is interesting that this Purana places the Varaha incarna- tion of Visnu, taken for the purpose of killing Hiranyaksa, later than Narasimha although Puranic tradition in general gives priority to it. It is possible that the Kurma Purana account reflects a stage prior to the schématisation of Visnu's incarnations. It seems that Prahlada's devotion to Visnu, and the consequent incar- nation of Narasimha for saving him from the anger of his father is a theme developed much later in the saga of Narasimha. It finds its full exposition in the Bhagavata Purana 9 which is the exponent par excellence of the doctrine of bhakti (devotion). This Purana tells us that while Hiranya- kasipu was engaged in practising severe penance the Devas invaded his palace and captured his queen who had Prahlada in her womb. Narada intervened and secured her release. He took her to his hermitage where she stayed till the return of Hiranyakasipu and listened to the preachings of Narada on Bhagavata Dharm. Being merely a women she forgot all about it but Prahlada imbibed it and retained it for ever in his memory10. From the very childhood he turned out to be a great devotee of Visnu, and although Hiranyakasipu tried various methods for disposing him off, he could do no injury to him. Ultimately he was so exasperated with his son that he decided to kill him with his own hands and shouted at him that if his god was everywhere why does he not show in the pillar of his hall. Saying so he hit hard against the pillar with his fist. Immediately the piller burst asunder with a loud noise and Visnu issued forth in the Narasimha form. He tore open the heart of the demon and was so angry that no one not even the gods and goddess Laksmi dared to approach him. Only Prahlada could do so, and he pacified the deity with a long eulogy. Later Brahma also worshipped him. The Visnu Purana makes only a brief reference11 to the story of Prahlada. It states that owing to his devotion to Visnu Prahlada was was thrown into the sea on his father's orders. But later Hiranyakasipu relented and a reconciliation took place between the father and the son. The son began to serve his father with diligence. At this point the account relates rather abruptly that after Hiranyakasipu was put to death by Narasimha Prahlada became the sovereign of the Daityas. It would seem that although the story of Prahlada's devotion to Visnu is well developed in the Visnu Purana , it is also aware of some popular version of the myth in which Hiranyakasipu and Prahlada were not always opposed to each other as is depicted in the Bhagavata Purana. The Mahabharata refers to the enmity between Prahlada and Indra. At one place12 Indra claims to have slain in battle Prahlada and other famous sons of Diti and in this way</page><page sequence="4">143 secured the lordship of the celestials. At another place13 it is narrated that Prahlada became the ruler of the three worlds owing to the merit accruing out of his virtuous behaviour. Indra having lost his sovereignty went to Prahlada in the guise of a brahmana and begged to be given instructions in true knowledge and righteous behaviour. Prahlada did so at length and even gifted away his "meritorious behaviour" to Indra. Consequently he became deprived of Righteousness, Truth, Might and Prosperity. It is curious that in the lengthy discourse14 given by Prahlada there is no mention of devotion to Vishu. T.A. Gopinatha Rao on the basis of some iconographie texts informs15 that there are two varities of Narasimha images, Girija-Narasimha and Sthauna-Narasimha. The conception underlying the first one is that the deity comes out of a mountain cave, in the second case the deity is supposed to have come out of a pillar. The two iconographie concepts clearly point to the prevalence of two divergent traditions regarding Narasimha ; of these although the latter had a greater hold on popular imagination and almost ousted the former, the first one seems to have been earlier in point of time. It seems that Narasimha was originally a lion- deity16. This is also indicated by such Puranic statements which tell us that in the battle against Hiranyakasipu lions born out of the body of Narasimha devoured the Danavas. This view is further confirmed by the evidence of a sculptured panel discovered at a site called Kondamotu on the oatskirts of Piduguralla village in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh17. The panel shows in bas- relief six standing figures, who have been identified with a good deal of justification as Pradyumna, Visnu Narasimha, Krsna, Samkarsana and Aniruddha. It is suggested18 that the seventh figure which is almost totally missing might have been that of Samba. Narasimha is depicted as a couchant lion with the only difference that two hands are added to his figure at the neck level and with these he holds gada and cakra, the two typically V aisnavite attributes. He also has the Srivatsa mark on his chest. On stylistic grounds the sculpture is placed in the late third or early fourth century A D. and is the earliest iconographie representation of Narasimha. Considering the unusual theriomorphic portrayal of Narasimha not men- tioned in any iconographie text, Md. Abdul Wahid Khan remarks that it is very likely that in the early fourth century A.D. the anthropomorphic representation is an exception rather than the rule. The codification of the rules of iconography from the fourth century onwards accentuated the ten- dency to represent deities in human forms. We may point out that the addition of extra hands is merely an indication of the figure's divinity in Indian iconography and it need not be assumed to reflect the composite •nature of the deity as is required in the story of Hiranyakasipu. This is</page><page sequence="5">144 proved by the convention of giving extra hands to such purely animal deities as Garuda, Matsya and Kurma. It is only in the later Gupta sculptures of the north and at Badami and Ellora in the Deccan that the deity is shown with the lion's head and a human body. According to a recent iconographical study19 the demon Hiranyakasipu is remarkably absent in early Narasimha sculptures, although in the post- Gupta period Narasimha is almost invariably represented as killing the demon. The Kondamotu sclupture is of great significance for the history of Vaisnavism. It represents a stage when the cults of Visnu, Narasimha and the Pancaviras of the Visnis were coalescing together. Visnu is shown simply as a two-armed god with the right hand in the abhaya pose and the left holding a conch shell, and he stands second from the left. There is no indication in the sculptured panel that Visnu enjoyed the central position in this synthesised worship. However, its discovery in the coastal Andhra may suggest that this area was the crucial scene of the evolution of Puranic Hindusim in the post-Iksvaku times when a number of bramanical dynasties such as the Brhatphalayanas, Anandas, Salankayanas and Visnukundins20 were exercising their political dominance. Nevertheless, the concept of a deity with a lion's face and human body is fully developed in Gupta iconography21 and references to the killing of Hiranyakasipu in the Santi Parva of the Mahabharata evince that this exploit of Narasimha must have been well known in the Gupta period. But, as has been shown earlier, the same cannot be said about the motif of Prahalada's devotion to Visnu and Visnu's appearance from a pillar to save his devotee. The question arises : when was the pillar motif added to the Narasimha legend and what was its original significance ? In a recent study22 it has been shown that the entire region extending from Sabarinarayana in Daksina Kosala to Mahendragiri in Kalinga was inhabited by the Sabara tribes in the early centuries of the christian era, and they worshiped deities in the form of wooden pillars. With the rise of brahmanical dynasties in this region, tribal deities became aryanised, nevertheless the famous Puri triad consisting of three small pillar-like wooden images of Jagannatha, Subhadra and Balabhadra show unmistakable traces of Sabara origins23. The aboriginal hill tribes of coastal Andhra and Kalinga still worship their gods in the form of wooden pillars24 and the practice can be traced back to earlier times. In the fifth-sixth centuries in the eastern Deccan there were rulers who described themselves as worshippers of the goddess Stambhesvari, ix ., Pillar-goddess.25 Later the Sulkis who claimed to be ruling over the whole of Gondrama, regarded goddess Stam- bhesvari as their family deity. Since inscriptions contain reference to eighteen Gondramas, the term has been interpreted in the sense of Gond tribeáj</page><page sequence="6">145 although some scolars are of the opinion that it denotes territory.26 According to one view27 the entire tract extending from Bansi and Barma in the north to Jay pore in the Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh was included in the Gondrama region. At any rate available evidence provides sufficient ground to believe that in the first millennium A.D. brahmanical influence gradually extended in the tribal regions of eastern Madhya Pradesh Andhra Pradesh and Orissa and Brahmanism assimilated, transformed and even supplanted many tribal cults. In our opinion the story of Narasimha's emergence from a pillar reflects the supersession of an aboriginal worship of some pillar deity by Visnavism through the cult of Narasimha. This hypothesis dérives some support from the history of the Narasimha temple at Simhachalam. The Simhachalam temple is situated on a hill 800 feet above the sea level at a distance of 10 miles to the north of Visakhapatnam. The small hill range on which the temple is located forms a part of the Eastern Ghats and is known as Kailasa. It has a number of perennial springs. Of these the most important one is known as Gangadhara and pilgrims flock to it for its famous medicinal properties. It also fertilises the pine-apple fields and numerous flowers and fruit gardens belonging to the temple, which happens to be one of the richest in the Andhra Pradesh. However, our chief interest lies in the strange nature of its principal icon. It is install- ed in the manner of a Siva-linga in the centre of the garbha-grha on a pedastai with a water-chute, and with exception of one day in a year it remains covered all the time with the unguent of sandalwood paste applied in such large quantities that it acquires the shape of a big sandalwood linga28. The real form of the deity, the nijasvarupa is open to view on the Aksaya Tritiya day only, that is, on the third day of the month of Vaisakha when the candanayatra festival is celebrated. The sandalwood paste is removed in the early hours of the morning and is applied again at the dusk leaving the nijasvarupa exposed to devotees for twelve hours. Of the total twelve mounds of sandalwood paste covering the image of the deity, four mounds are applied on this day, and the rest is applied in three ins- talments on the fourteenth of the bright half of month Vaisakha, the full moon day in the month of Jyestha and the full-moon day in the month of Asadha. The paste is applied on the layer of silk-cloth, and when it is removed, the cloth comes out in the shreds. It is curious that no offering is made to the nijasvarupa of the diety, even the daily offering is post- poned temporarily till the god gains back the shape of a linga by the night fall. According to a local tradition29 Simachalam was at first a centre of Saivism, but Ramanuja, who came to the place in the course of his travels,</page><page sequence="7">146 defeated the priests of the temple in a religious disputation and won them over to Visnavism. He then or der d the masons of the temple to convert the linga into an image of Varaha-Narsimha, but the icon began to bleed before the work was complete. Thinking that the deity is annoyed at this transformation, the head priest began to apply the sandalwood paste to give it its former shape. This stopped the flow of the blood. Since then the idol remains in the form of a linga coated with sandalwood paste, appearing in its form only on the Aksaya Tritiya day when the paste is to be applied afresh. The legend is generally dismissed as a product of sectarian rancour and it is pointed out30 that the inscriptional evidence at Simhachalam clearly attests to the fact that the temple was already a Vaisnavite centre in the last quarter of the 11th century A.D. the generally accepted date of Ramanuja. Similar tales regarding the conversion of Saiva shrines into Vaisnava ones by Ramanuja are also current about the Srikurmesvara temple at Sri kurmam and the Sri Venkatesvara temple at Tirupati. Nevertheless, there are strong grounds to believe that at one stage 1 Simhachalam was a centre of Saiva worship. Not only, the principal deity receives worship in the form of a linga only the hill range on which the temple is situated is known as Kailasa and its largest spring is known as Gangadhara. The two gates at the foot of the hill are known as Bhairava- dvara and Madhavadvará. All these terms indicate Shiva influence, Further the temple also celebrates the festival of Kamadakana , which is quite incongruous in a Vaisnava shrine, for is Vaisnavism god Kama, being identical with Pradyumna, is one of the vyuha forms of Visnu, on the other hand, the burning of Kama is an important deed of Siva. The festival is obviously of Saiva origin. Finally, the deity is given by the devotees vibhuti , cows, pulses and rice and all those objects are generally offered to Siva and not Visnu. The Visnudharmottra Pur ana 31 gives a curious account of Visnu's bursting forth from a linga . It narrates that there was a brahmana named Visvaksena belonging to the family of Gautama. He was a Satvata, completely devoted to Visnu only (&lt; ekaniabhavopagatah ) and an adopt in the pancakala worship in accordance with the rules of the Pancaratra. He wandered all over the earth in order to worship Krsna. Once he arived at a big mountain where all the people were devotees of Siva ( Mahesvarah ). He took his bath in nearby spring and worshiped Kesava. In the vedi constructed for the purpose he offered whatever bhoga was available in the locality. By chance, a man accompanied by a number of person holding swords and bows in their hands arrived there. This man was the son of the local chieftain (gramasvamikumarakah) and he saw Visvaksena worshipp - ing Janardaną. He approached the brahmana and told him that he was</page><page sequence="8">147 having excessive pain in his head and so was unable to take his bath and perform worship. Hence, the brahman should go to the temple and offer worship on his behalf to god Sankara established there in the form of a linga . The brahmana replied to the prince "we are well known for wor- shipping Visnu in his four manifestations or in one of his incarnations. I do not worship any other god. Therefore please go away." Immediately the Kumara drew out his sword and told the brahman, "I shall kill you without doubt if you do not go to the temple and worship linga . Wicked man, is.there god higher than Sankara?". Having been spoken thus the brahmana in order to save his life went with the Kumara to the temple. Seeing the linga there he thought to himself, "Visnu is immanent every- where and Mahadeva is endowed with Visnu's anger. Lord Narsimha also is the personification of the same anger. Therefore I shall worship in this linga the god having the form of Narsimha. In this way I shall per- form the daily worship to the god and save my life". Thus in his mind he meditated upon Visnu having the form of Narasimha in the linga and performed the worship by saying "I bow unto Narasimha" with folded hands. Hearing these words the Kumara immediately pulled out his sword to attack the brahmana. At once the god in the form of Narasimha appeared breaking open the linga and he burnt the son of the local chief- tain and his followers with the fire of his eyes. He also blessed the brahmana, the chief among the Satvatas, with divine vision and the brahmana praised the deity with a stotra. Although the above account does not give the name of the place where the incident is supposed to have taken place, there is no doubt that the Purana writer had Simhachalam in mind. It is noteworthy that the brahmana Visvaksena is said to have taken his bath not in a river but in a spring, and Simhachalam is famous for its springs. At the present stage of our knowledge it is not possible to assert with any amount of certainty that in the brahmana Visvaksena we have a reference to Ramanujacarya, the great teacher of Pancaratra Vaisnavism, but there need not be any hesitation in concluding that the Vaisnavisation of the Simhachalam temple was accomplished rather arbitrarily through some trick in collusion with the priests of the temple at a time when Saiva- Vaisnava rivalry was at its height. According to R.G. Hazra the Visnudharmottara Purana was either compiled in southern Kashmir or in northern parts of Punjab.32 Earlier Buhler33 and Winternitz34 also had expressed the same view. If this is accepted, it would appear that the events at Simhachalam must have been sensational enough to reach the ears of the compiler of the Purana in Kashmir. R.G. Hazra thinks that the Vishnuiharrnottara Parana cannot be later than A.D. 600,36</page><page sequence="9">148 However, we may point out that the episode of the bursting asunder of the linga ( linga-sphota-Narasimha-darsana ) is narrated in the last two chapters of the Purana, so it is possible that it is a later addition to the main body of the text. We have been able to trace some more literary reference to Simhachalam, but none of these help us in dating the temple earlier than the eleventh century. The Brhaspati Sutra mentions36 Simhachalam amóng the eight important sacred places of the Vaisnavas, but as F.W. Thomas points out37, the text cannot be earlier than the 12th century A.D. as it apparently refers to the Yadavas of Nevagiri. The Matsya Purana mentions38 Srisaila, Narasimha, Mahendra and Srirangam as fit places for the performance of Sraddha. The sequence of narration suggests that Narasimha is to be identified with Simhachalam ; it is also mentioned in the Skauda Parana ,39 All these references show that Simhachalam was a famous centre of Vaisnavism in medival times and corroborate epigraphic evidence from the temple, but they do not throw any light on the origin of the shrine. K. Sundaram is of the opinion40, that the Simhachalam temple must have begun as a forest shrine several hundred years before the 11th century, but its real history starts from the time oi Kulottunga Cola. According to him Simhachalam assumed strategic importance in the time of Calukya- Colas, and the officers of Kulottunga who renamed Visakha-pattana as Kulottunga Cola pattana "must have actlvised the life of the temple". He points out that although Kulottunga was a Saiva some of his officers were Vaisnavas. Early inscriptions of Simhachalam clearly show Tamil influence at the temple. The conduct of the ritual at the temple also is governed by the Pravida tradition of the Srivaisnava priests. Notwithstanding late references to the Simhachalam temple, Sundaram is quite right in postulating an early origin of the shrine. According to some scholars Simhachalam was at first a Buddhist centre similar to the Buddhist sanctuaries at Sankaram (Sangharamam) and Ramatirtham situated respectively 30 miles south and 40 miles north of Simhachalam. But the evidence is not conclusive.41 It is curious that most of the temples dedicated to Narasimha in the Deccan are situated on the hill top and the aboriginal tribes of these areas are known to worship mountain deities. The hill tribe of the Chenchus worship the god Narasimhasvami enshrined at Ahobilam in the Nandiyal Taluk of Kurnool district and they call him 'Obalesudu'. They believe that this god had married a Chenchu girl and given them the bamboo-forest as the bride- . price. For this reason they claim to have exclusive rights to cut and sell the bamboos from the forest.43 They also put the vertical caste mark on their</page><page sequence="10">149 forehead like the Vaisnavites. The Chenchus of the Nallamalai hills look upon the god Mallikarjuna (siva) of Srisailam (Nandikotkur taluk of the Kurnool district, Andhra Pradesh) as their relative and call him 'Chenchu-Mallaya'. The linga of Mallikarjuna, worshipped on the hill is considered as one of the svyambhu or self emanated lingas. It appears that the Chenchus, Yanadis and Sabaras are descended from the same original stock. Thurston informs45 us that Bonthuk Sabaras, who unlike the Telugu speaking Chenchus speak corrupt Oriya, are called 'Chenchu vandhu5 and like the Telugu Chenchus claim relationship with the god Narasimha of Ahobilam. It seems that most of these hill shrines began as aboriginal cult spots and were later appropriated by Buddhism, Saivism or Vaisnavism as their respective influences advanced in the region. At Simhachalam the transition to Vaisnavism has been evidently through Saivism, but the local aboriginal belief in the efficacy of the pilar deities survives in the worship of one the pillars of the mukha-mandapa of the Simhachalam temple known as 'Kappas Stambham5, which according to the popular belief, has the power of curing cattle disease and barrenness in women.46 The choice of Narasimha incarnation of Visnu for identification with the aboriginal cult-objects may indicate either the popularity of a lion-deity in this region or, as is more likely, the fact that Narasimha symbolished the wrathful aspect of Visnu famous for killing those who opposed him and as such was more suited for sectarian purposes. It is note- worthy that the Saivite sectarian response to the challenge of Narasimha created the concept of the Sarabhesa or Simhaghna-murti in which Siva is shown as trampling upon Narasimha. In later tradition Hiranyakasipu is sometimes represented as a devotee of Siva. However, the late develop- ment of the pillar motif in the Narasimha legend and its first occurrence in the Bhagavata Parana suggests that Narasinha appropriated the cult of some aboriginal pillar deity, of which an historical example is provided by the temple of Simhachalam. It is interesting to note that Narasimha is the presiding deity of the Jagannatha temple of Puri and in all the ceremonies "beginning from puja to cooking" offerings are first made to Narasimha.47 The wooden pillar deities of Puri, although claimed48 by Buddhism, Saivism and Vaisnavism at different stages of their history are undoubtedly of Sabara origin.
