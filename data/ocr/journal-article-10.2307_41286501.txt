<plain_text><page sequence="1">BETWEEN JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY: THE UNUSUAL ENGRAVED BORDER OF A KETUBBAH FROM MANTUA, 1689 IN THE LIBRARY OF THE JEWISH THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY* Shalom Sabar The Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York (JTS) houses one of the world's largest collections of Hebrew manuscripts and rare printed books. In addition to about 11,000 manuscripts and 30,000 Genizah fragments, the JTS Library owns some 600 marriage contracts (Ketubbot), many of which attractively illustrated. This superb collection of Ketubbot is, in fact, second in its size only to the extensive Ketubbah collection of the Jewish National and University Library, Jerusalem. However, beyond its wide scope, the JTS collection is outstanding for its wide range of specimens from numerous and little known Jewish communities in Europe and Islamic lands, some of which are the earliest known (for example, the earliest extant Ketubbot from Greece and Kurdistan). In addition, it includes many Ketubbah fragments from the Cairo Genizah, though they generally lack any form of decoration. Many of the contracts represent some the best known examples of the joyous art of Ketubbah decoration, be it the colorful folk art from San'a (Yemen) and Isfahan (Iran), or the more sophisticated examples from Venice and Amsterdam. The Italian Ketubbot in the Seminary's collection deserve special attention, both for their diversity and artistic level. There are 145 examples, which date from 1559 to 1891, and represent all the major Jewish communities in central and north Italy. Also included are Ketubbot from the smaller and less known communities and localities. For example, one Ketubbah is from the village Varlungo near Florence (located on the south side of the Arno river, and described in the * Fondly dedicated to Prof. Luisella Mortara-Ottolenghi, my first guide to Hebrew manuscripts and Ketubbot in public and private collections in Italy.</page><page sequence="2">2 LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL Ketubbah: "Here in Florence, one mile and a third outside the city, a place called Varlungo, which is situated on the rivers Arno and Mugnone"). Another example is from Nizenta near Verona, and a third comes from Saliceto di Panaro in Emilia. Many are signed by leading rabbinical authorities in such towns as Ancona, Venice, Verona and Mantua. Some are the actual contracts of known figures in Italian- Jewish history (for example, one Ketubbah, from Gorizia, 1835, commemorates the wedding of the noted scholar and teacher in the Rabbinical College of Padua, Rabbi Hillel [Lelio] Delia Torre [1805- 1871]). A complete regional and chronological list of the Seminary's Italian Ketubbot is appended herewith. The full analysis of these contracts constitutes the first of a two-volume catalogue raisonne of the Seminary's Ketubbah collection, prepared by this writer (to be published in a year or two). The following is a sample of an entry, dedicated to one of the most curious and unusual Ketubbah borders created in seventeenth century Italy. This remarkable border is printed from a copperplate engraving, and is known from five Ketubbot, two of which were unfortunately lost in the Second World War (see below and note 3). Of the three extant, two are in the collection of the Seminary, including the earliest of the five, from Mantua, 1689 (JTS Ket. 126; No. 11 in the book), which is the subject of the discussion below.

Description and Analysis Decorating a Ketubbah with a border prepared from a copper engraving was generally not common in Italy. While this practice enjoyed great popularity among the Sephardim in Holland and the communities associated with them,1 Italian Jews generally preferred the hand-made, personally illustrated Ketubbah. Only a few exceptions to this rule are known: one is a simple engraving of a floral frame, preserved on a single Ketubbah from Verona, 1681 (Los Angeles, Hebrew Union College Skirball Museum; Fig. 2); another is the rich "cosmological" border, presented on a number of Ketubbot from the Veneto - which in the early examples was printed from a copper etching as well2. The most curious Ketubbah in this group is the present, much richer, attractive and highly unusual border, known from five Ketubbot: two are in the JTS collection (Figs. 1 and 3), one is in the Beinecke Library at Yale University (New Haven), while two others were apparently destroyed in the Second World 1. Cf. S. Sabar, Ketubbah: Jewish Marriage Contracts of the Hebrew Union College Skirball Museum and Klau Library (Philadelphia and New York, 1990), pp. 243-245, 248-250, 265-271 (besides Amsterdam, examples are known from other towns in Holland, and from the Sephardi communities of London, Hamburg, and even New York).

It is important to note that of the five known, the present example is not only the earliest, but also the only one extant without the addition of paint over the engraving. The exquisite engraved border of this Ketubbah incorporates no fewer than twenty-seven biblical episodes, one large scene at the top of the contract, and twenty-six in the miniature cartousches which surround the text below (see Diagram of the Ketubbah - Fig. 4). The lower section is composed primarily of two rectangular illustrated frames separated by three narrow frames filled with foliage. The center of the top and bottom borders is dominated by an ornate, crowned cartouche supported on each side by a nude putto. Both cartouches here remain empty4. While the large cartouche of the upper border spans all of the frames, that of the lower is smaller, leaving room for a double-headed eagle in the center of the outer illustrated frame (see the detail in Fig. 7). The upper section of the decoration is filled with an exquisite illustration of a nude Adam and Eve reclining beneath the Tree of Knowledge. Eve is shown facing the viewer, in a manner that is reminiscent of Venus paintings of the Renaissance (e.g., Titian's Venus of Urbino), while Adam, his head in profile, is portrayed from behind. The two figures additionally recall Michelangelo's well-known series of sculptures for the Medici Chapel in Florence (151 9-34), with the female figures (Dawn and Night) and male (Day and Twilight) presented in a nearly identical composition. A bird-headed serpent carrying a piece of fruit is coiled around the tree trunk. Six putti hover above the couple, carrying over them a long garland canopy laden with fruit. The two putti on the ends each support an oval, foliate cartouche. In these cartouches are the first two illustrations of the extensive biblical cycle that 3. The other Ketubbah in the Seminary's collection is from Chieri, 1706 (Ket. 2 [JTS Ket. 260] - see detail in Fig. 3). The two lost examples are both from Cittadella, 1693: the earlier of the two was previously in the Jewish Museum in Berlin - reproduced in K. Schwarz, Die Juden in der Kunst (Berlin, 1928), pl. between pp. 92-93; the later, slightly damaged at the lower border, was housed in the Frankfurt a/M Jewish Museum; its reproduction appears in Menorah: Jiidisches Familienblatt fur Wissenschaft, Kunst und Literatur (Vienna / Frankfurt a/M), vol. 5, Feb. 1927, p. 103 (mistakenly dated 1694). The fifth example, curiously, commemorates a wedding in Nice in Provence, 1690, and is part of the Sholem Asch collection in the Beinecke Library, Yale University, New Haven (reproduced in L. Nemoy, Catalogue of Hebrew and Yiddish Manuscripts from the Library of Sholem Asch [New Haven, 1945], facing the title page, and see there p. 21, item 1 19). 4. The emblems in the two Cittadella Ketubbot of 1693 are blank as well, while the Chieri and Nice Ketubbot do bear family insignia (see Fig. 3).</page><page sequence="5">BETWEEN JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY: 5 continues in the frames of the lower section. Surprisingly enough, the putto on the right holds an anthropomorphic, winged depiction of God the Creator bringing into existence the sun and the moon (No. 1 in the Diagram). Stars flank the deity, whose drapery covers only one shoulder, on either side. The opposite illustration (No. 2 in the Diagram - Fig. 5) shows God breathing life into the limp, reclining Adam, whose hand he holds. The Creation narrative resumes in the outer illustrated border of the lower section, the corners of which contain bare-breasted mermaids. In this border, wreath-like square frames, supported by putti and eagles, hold depictions of biblical episodes. The "first" illustration, the Creation of Eve ( Genesis 2: 21-22), is shown on the top right (No. 3 - Fig. 6): the winged, bearded Creator lifts Eve by the wrists from the side of the sleeping Adam. The Fall of Adam and Eve ( Genesis 3: 6) is shown on the top left (No. 4), where Eve receives fruit from the coiled serpent. Adam, seated to the right of Eve, is already eating a piece of fruit. The next eight scenes alternate back and forth from the right to left border. Beginning on the upper right is God's admonition of a shameful Adam and Eve (No. 5; Genesis 3: 16-19). This is followed by the Expulsion from Paradise (No. 6; Genesis 3: 23-24), carried out by a sword-bearing, unbearded angel. The Punishment of Adam and Eve (cf. Genesis 3: 16-19), represented by a toiling Adam and a reclining Eve, is illustrated in the next frame (No. 7). This scene is followed by that of a nude Cain killing a nude Abel with a club (No. 8; Genesis 4: 8). The Admonition of Cain (No. 9; Genesis 4:1 Off) is shown next, followed by a scene (No. 10) from the Flood: Noah's ark at sea, with animals drowning in the surrounding waters ( Genesis 7: 21-23). The next episode (No. 11), an angel commanding a praying Noah ( Genesis 7: 1-5), disturbs the narrative sequence, for this episode precedes in time the previous scene of the flood itself. The next illustration (No. 12) depicts Noah's thankful sacrifice after having survived the Flood ( Genesis 8: 20). The episodes of the lower border do not continue the chronological order maintained in the frame. From right to left are shown: • The Binding of Isaac (No. 13; Genesis 22: 9-13) • The apocryphal story of Susannah and the Elders (No. 14 - Fig. 7, right cartouche) • King David spying on a nude Bathsheba (II Samuel 11: 2; No. 15 - Fig. 7, left cartouche) • Lot and his daughters ( Genesis 19: 32-35; No. 16 - Fig. 8).</page><page sequence="6">6 LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL The inner illustrated border presents several scenes that are somewhat difficult to identify. The main hero of this section is, curiously, Samson, who appears in at least three scenes. The top border shows him (right) pulling down the Philistine Temple in Gaza (Judges 16: 29-30; No. 17) and on the left, Delilah cutting his hair (Judges 16: 19; No. 18 - Fig. 9). An earlier event in Samson's life, the rending of the lion (Judges 14: 5-6; No. 19 - Fig. 10), tops the right border, while the opposite scene at left depicts the meeting of Jacob and Esau: Jacob standing with his staff at right embracing his brother (Genesis 33: 4; No. 20). The central two episodes are extremely difficult to decipher. At the center of the left border (No. 21 - Fig. 11), a man is shown seated behind a table writing in an open book, while another man stands in front of him with his arms spread forth; a third man stands behind the writing figure (dictating to him?). Could this be David writing a letter to Joab concerning Uriah (II Samuel 11:14)? Or Mordechai "writing books" to be dispatched to all the Jews throughout Ahasuerus' kingdom (Esther 9: 20)? Or Baruch the scribe writing the words of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 36: 4)? Puzzling likewise is the scene to its left (No. 22 - Fig. 12): a woman (?) washing the feet of two seated men. Assuming this is a biblical scene (i.e., not the popular Washing of the Feet episode in the New Testament), we may assume that this is Rebecca washing the feet of Eliezer and "the feet of the men with him" (Genesis 24: 32) 5. The scene at bottom right (No. 23 - Fig. 13) is questionable as well. It certainly depicts a marriage scene as celebrated at the time: a man at center uniting the hands of a couple6. However, this could be the marriage of any biblical couple, especially of one of the heroes presented in the other miniatures (e.g., David and Bathsheba, Samson and Delilah, or Isaac and Rebecca). The opposite scene at left shows Moses on Mt. Sinai during the Giving of the Law (Exodus 19:18ff.; No. 24 - Fig. 14). The lower border goes back to the book of Genesis, displaying at 5. Another possibility is Abigail, whg tells David: "Your handmaid is ready to be your maidservant, to wash the feet of my lord's servants" (/ Samuel 25: 41); however, there is no mention that she actually did this. 6. The ceremony usually consisted of the uniting of the couple's right hands (dextrarum iunctio), while here it is his right and her left. Exceptions are known, however - the most famous of which is Jan van Eyck, Giovanni Arnolfini and his Bride ; see E. Panofsky, Jan van Eyck's 'Arnolfini' Portrait, «Burlington Magazine», 54, 1934, pp. 1 17-127. For this ceremony in the life of Italian Jews, cf. J. Gutmann, The Jewish Life Cycle, Leiden, 1987, p. 15.</page><page sequence="7">BETWEEN JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY: 7 right Joseph fleeing from Potiphar's wife (Genesis 39:12; No. 25 - Fig. 15). At left is the last scene (No. 26 - Fig. 16), showing a woman during childbirth assisted by four figures (midwives?). Two babies are visible, which allows for two possible episodes: Rebecca giving birth to Jacob and Esau ( Genesis 25: 24-26), or Tamar giving birth to her twins ( Genesis 38: 27) 1 . The narrative frames are supported by putti in various positions, eagles, and the aforementioned nude mermaids with double tails. Was the anonymous artist who created this unusual engraved border a Jew or a Christian? Was the border created to frame a Jewish marriage contract, or perhaps another document? In trying to answer these questions, one should take into consideration the fact that the general layout of the page and the selection of episodes and motifs largely deviates from the norms accepted among Ketubbah artists of seventeenth-century Italy. These features point to an artist who was not accustomed to creating, or familiar with, Ketubbot of the time. On the other hand, it is clear he was well versed and closely familiar with the graphic and book arts of his times. Though the exact source for his work is yet to be discovered, parallel graphic cycles pertaining to various sections of the stories in the Ketubbah are known. For example, the Creation episodes with the image of God appear in several illustrated sixteenth-century Bibles (Fig. 17)8. Given the unusual depiction of God's image, one must conclude that the artist was Christian9. This would also explain the inclusion of the apocryphal story of Susannah, which is foreign to Judaism but extremely popular in Christian art. Similarly, the erotic story of Lot and his daughters, though 7. The former possibility seems more likely, since the second baby seems to be holding his brother's heel (cf. Genesis 25:26). 8. Our example is from a Bible printed in Venice, 1535. For this example see also I. Fishof, Le origini iconografiche della ketubba veneziana , in Ketubbot italiane: Antichi contratti nuziali ebraici miniati , Milano 1984, p. 192, fig. 8. The illustrations in this Bible are closely related and apparently based on an earlier edition, printed in Venice, 1517 by Giorgio Rusconi. (See: E. Barbieri, Le Bibbie italiane del Quattrocento e del Cinquecento, Milano, 1991, vol. 2 tav. Dl). For a general introduction to the illustrations in printed books of the time, see E. P. Goldschmidt, The Printed book of the Renaissance: Three Lectures on Type , Illustration , Ornament, Amsterdam, 1966. 9. On this issue, see C. Roth, Representations of God in Jewish Art , Fourth World Congress of Jewish Studies: Papers , Vol. II (Jerusalem, 1967), pp. 139-140 and E. Saltman, The ' Forbidden Image ' in Jewish Art , «Journal of Jewish Art», 8, 1981, pp. 42- 53. Roth and Saltman discuss and reproduce this very Ketubbah.</page><page sequence="8">8 LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL biblical, is not generally known in Jewish art. It seems that our artist had a strong interest in what is known as Weibermacht representations (i.e., the power of women over men), as well as illicit relationships in the Bible and their results. Thus, in addition to the story of Lot and his daughters and Susanna and the elders, there are the erotic episodes of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, David and Bathsheba, and the curious relationship of Samson and Delilah. (The story of Judah and Tamar is possibly implied as well.) In contemporary Christian tradition, both in Catholic Italy and even more in Protestant Holland, these stories were very popular and were often given moralistic overtones (e.g., Joseph's modesty is emphasized in the story of Potiphar's wife), and accordingly appeared often in seventeenth century "high" and folk art 10. The order of the episodes on the page, however, does not conform with any Christian (or Jewish) tradition. The engraving was apparently created for a Ketubbah. This can be deduced first and foremost from the two empty shields designated for two families' insignia. In addition, the fact that it was reproduced on at least five contracts shows that its appearance on the Mantuan example is not accidental, or serving the whims of an exceptional patron. Furthermore, placing the first wedded couple at top, although clearly modeled after Christological scenes of the "Original Sin," shows that the artist understood the purpose of the border. It should also be noted that some other biblical heroes, including Samson, Joseph and David, appear in some rare Ketubbot, generally with somewhat different iconography 1 '. Another crucial question is when and where was this engraving 10. For examples of art-historical studies in which the moral issues of these biblical stories are examined against the theological and ideological views of the time, see: A.W. Lowenthal, Lot and his Daughters as Moral Dilemma , in The Age of Rembrandt: Studies in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Painting, Papers in Art History from Pennsylvania State University, v. 3, Michigan, 1988, pp. 12-27; and M. K. Kahr, Delilah , in Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany , eds. N. Braude and M. D. Garrard, New York, 1982, pp. 199-245. 11. For some reproduced examples, see the following scenes: Delilah cutting Samson's hair (in a Ketubbah from Busseto, 1677, in Sabar, Ketubbah , pp. 62, 64); King David watching the bathing Bathsheba (Fiorenzuola, 1832, /v/, pp. 99-100); Joseph as the Prince of Egypt and David with the head of Goliath, welcomed by the daughters of Israel (Turin, 1755, in J. Weinstein, A Collector's Guide to Judaica [New York, 1985], pl. xxviii); Samson rending the lion and scenes from the lives of Isaac, Joseph, Moses, David and Solomon (Rome, 1734, in C. Benjamin, The Stieglitz Collection: Masterpieces of Jewish Art , The Israel Museum [Jerusalem, 1987], no. 215, pp. 320-321 ).</page><page sequence="9">BETWEEN JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY: 9 created? The noted Jewish art historian Franz Landsberger, writing about this Ketubbah in 1955, suggested that "the style warrants attributing the cut to the sixteenth century," while the engravings were made at "a time nearer the end of the seventeenth century" 12 . While the style indeed points to an early date, folk artists commonly adopt a "modern" style only after it is well-established, and hold on to it for a much longer period13. Thus, we are more inclined to accept Cecil Roth's suggestion and to date the engraving to the mid-seventeenth century, or more likely the 1660's to 1680's14 - a period in which Ketubbah illustration in Italy reached its height (which also strengthens the hypothesis that the engraving was created for a Ketubbah). As for the place of origin, Landsberger simply offers "upper Italy," since the only other example he knew of at the time, namely the Berlin Ketubbah of Cittadella, 1693, also came from this region. Another reason for this provenance is that the two contracts he knew of "display.. .Austria's two-headed eagle" 15. In fact, in both cases Landsberger is not entirely correct, for another example now known is from Nice, 16 and double- headed eagles also appear in Ketubbot from other regions not related to Austria, 17 as well as in general Italian coats of arms 18. At the same time, the frame - despite all its idiosyncrasies - is more in the spirit of North Italian Ketubbot than of those of Central Italy (e.g., Rome or Ancona). Cecil Roth suggests placing it in Mantua itself, and cites in this context the title page of the book Minhat Shai, printed in Mantua in 1742 (Fig. 12. Landsberger, Illuminated Marriage Contracts , pp. 519-20. 13. See the discussion of this issue, as far as it concerns Jewish artists of the period, by M. Metzger, Style in Jewish Art of the 17th and 18th Centuries in Relation to the Baroque and the Rococo , «Gazette des beaux-arts» 88, 1976, pp. 181-193. 14. Roth, Representations of God , p. 140. 15. Landsberger, Illuminated Marriage Contracts , p. 520. 16. This is the Nice Ketubbah at the Beinecke Library, mentioned in note 3, above. 17. For example, in a Ketubbah from Lugo, 1740 (Forli, Biblioteca Comunale; see S. Sabar, Ebrei a Lugo: I contratti matrimoniali , Exhibition Catalog, Biblioteca Comunale Fabrizio Trisi [Lugo, 1994], pp. 34-35, 115-116). The double-headed eagle appears here twice - once as the emblem of the bride's family, and again in an almost identical manner with our Ketubbah at bottom center. 18. For example, in a coat of arms from Bologna designed by the engraver Giovanni Luigi Valesio; see V. Birke, The Illustrated Bartsch : Italian Masters of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries , 40, Commentary pt. 1 (New York, 1987), no. 157 p. 136. It should also be noted that at the time our Ketubbah was produced, the duchy of Mantua was not under Austria (this happened ofily in 1708 - see S. Simonsohn, History of the Jews in the Duchy of Mantua Jerusalem, 1977, pp. 66 ff., 72 ff.).</page><page sequence="10">1 o LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL 18). The eight biblical episodes on this page indeed relate stylistically to our Ketubbah, and even a related image of God appears in Ezekiel's Vision at lower left. Naturally, this page could not have been the source for our Ketubbah, but it points to the lenient attitude of the Mantuan community towards this type of images. It would be very tempting, therefore, to hypothesize that this engraving was commissioned in Mantua for this very Ketubbah and later used elsewhere. Indeed, the bridegroom, Abraham Trabotto, is a member of a very important rabbinical family19. His father is most likely identical with the well-known Mantuan banker Raphael Trabotto, who in 1711 filed a petition with the Austrian authorities in Vienna to deal in money-lending in Mantua. (His petition was approved)20. Had the Trabotto family commissioned this Ketubbah personally, however, the shields for the insignia would probably either have been filled in or else not included at all (and certainly not left blank). Therefore it is possible that the engraving was produced in Mantua but some years before the present wedding21. The text of the Ketubbah itself does not contain any significant variations (except, perhaps, the usage of actual amounts and Venetian coinage in the dowry clause). In comparison with the accomplished border, the scribal work is much simpler. The careless scribe did not pay attention to creating an even left margin, and the size of the letters is not consistent. Note, finally, that the two witnesses are known Mantuan rabbis. Rabbi Hayyim Norzi (or Norsa) was a member of the local rabbinical court from 1665, and later served as scribe and rabbi of the community (d. ca. 1698)22. Rabbi Judah Briel (1643-1722), the second witness, was an extremely respected member of his community, and some of his students are among the best-known rabbinical authorities of Italian 19. Cf. Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1972), V. 15 col. 1292. 20. Ibid., and see Simonsohn, Mantua , p. 241. 21. Another possibility that should be considered concerns the land in which the artist was trained. As engraved Ketubbot enjoyed great popularity in Holland, the association of the artist with that country is more than plausible. This would explain the large number of biblical scenes which were extremely popular in Protestant Holland due to their moral implications. Other details of the composition, such as the putti and the floral frames, are modeled on designs in Italian popular crafts (e.g., printed book illustrations, majolica plates, furniture, etc.). 22. For Rabbi Norzi's career, see Simonsohn, Mantua , p. 723 (and s.v. index under Haim Norsa).</page><page sequence="11">BETWEEN JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY: 1 1 Jewry23. Rabbi Briel was ordained in Venice in 1677, and his elaborate ordination certificate is preserved at the JTS Library as well (Fig. 19)24. It should be noted, finally, that whoever the artist of this engraving was, the design he created was not only used on at least four other extant Ketubbot, but was also imitated by other artists. In 1746, a Ketubbah commemorating a marriage in Livorno - definitely illustrated by a Jewish craftsman - is clearly based on our engraving (Fig. 20) 25 . Accordingly, it depicts the large figures of Adam and Eve flanking the Tree of Knowledge - except that Adam is now on the right and Eve on the left. In the horizontal panel below appear four cartouches with biblical scenes - also clearly inspired by the engraved border. In copying the engraving, the Livorno artist introduced a few significant changes that reveal his Jewish background. First, Eve is not shown totally nude: the artist "clad" her with a floral wreath. Second, in the Creation of Eve scene (first on the right), the image of the Creator has been eliminated. Thus, an engraving created by a Christian artist in the second half of the seventeenth century was fully Judaized, becoming a typical and favored Ketubbah design about 60 or 70 years later.
