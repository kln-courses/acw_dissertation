In fact, in Venetia, Disraeli's Byronism becomes not simply a matter of "conception and style," but of substance. When Venetia was published in May of 1837, ^ts title-page included two epigraphs from George Gor don, Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto the Third: "Is thy face like thy mother's, my fair child?" (1.1) and "The child of love, though born in bitterness | And nurtured in convulsion" (118.1094-5). Focusing on the nature and experience of the child, the quotations seem to direct attention to the title character of the novel, Venetia, the daughter of a famous poet, Marmion Herbert, who has been in exile for his political and social beliefs.4 But in fact the epigraphs more successfully point to the novel's complicated relationship with the web of rumor and anec dote surrounding the life and legend of Lord Byron. In Venetia, Disraeli 3. Dep. Hughenden 7/3, fol. 4. To my knowledge, this quotation has not been reproduced elsewhere. 4. The following plot summary will help clarify Disraeli's Byronic negotiations. A devout Tory and Anglican, Lady Annabel Herbert has separated from her hus band and retreated into the seclusion of her husband's ancestral estate to rear their daughter. Her husband, Marmion, has argued in his poetry for the rights of men and the abolition of religion, and, after Annabel's departure, Marmion leaves England to fight in the American colonies, a traitor to his King and a reprobate to his country's church. When Plantagenet Cadurcis inherits the neighboring estate, he becomes Vene tia's playfellow, and the two are educated together until Plantagenet's mother dies and he is sent to live with his guardian. Eventually, Venetia discovers the well kept secret of her paternity in a locked room that holds a replica of her mother's bridal chamber, poetry written by her father, and a portrait of Marmion that she gazes on in rapture. From this point, the novel moves toward reuniting Venetia with Plantagenet (now a Whig and a poet therefore doubly inappropriate as a suitor in the eyes of Lady Annabel), and with her father. After several awkward reunions, the Herbert family, Plantagenet and his cousin George share some hap py months abroad. When Plantagenet, and Marmion Herbert are drowned at sea, Lady Annabel and Venetia return to England, where Venetia and George eventu ally marry.</page><page sequence="3">Byron and Benjamin Disraeli's Venetia 451 refashions that legend into a romance, a story both "pathetic and seri ous," as the novel's publisher Henry Colburn had requested when he commissioned it in 1836. For Venetia offers readers a fictionalized retell ing of Byron's life and his friendship with Percy Shelley. Byron — or an ideal of Byron — becomes a method for examining ideas of political and domestic duty and the choices one must make when those two re quirements clash. At the same time, Disraeli's text offers a revised view of Byron's character — one more in keeping with the Byron Disraeli has grown to know through his reading of Byron's biographers, such as Thomas Medwin and Thomas Moore, as well as through conversations with those who had known Byron: John Murray II, Byron's publisher; Tita Falcieri, Byron's manservant who now worked for Isaac Disraeli; Marguerite Gardiner the Countess of Blessington, famous for her Jour nal of Conversations with Lord Byron; John Edward Trelawny, a member of the Byron-Shelley Pisan circle; and Benjamin's own father, Isaac. Venetia'% publisher, Colburn, actively used Disraeli's Byronism to mar ket the novel. For the preliminary advertisement Colburn included the well-known Byronic epigraphs that appear on Venetian title-page. Then, once reviews appeared, Colburn excerpted laudatory blurbs that direct potential purchasers to the extent of the novel's Byronism: "The story is shaped upon the character of Lord Byron, and some of the events of his life. He figures here, as in his own poems, as the hero of the piece, and is introduced as Lord Cadurcis, at the age of eleven years. His fond, pas sionate, and inconsistent mother, is also prominent; whilst Miss Cha worth, somewhat metamorphosed, appears as Venetia Herbert. There is much of poetical beauty and vivid description throughout the volumes."5 In fact, the Byronic context of the work was the only point of contro versy among the contemporary reviewers. Some found Disraeli's con ception a fusion of "romance" and "reality" whereby "no two events scarcely, in the life of either [Byron or Shelley], are connected, or repre sented as they occurred"; others deemed it an "inexcusable" "violation of private and personal feelings": "it is still a little too soon to think of weaving three volumes out of the misfortunes of Byron, or the morbid 5.

The Court Magazine labeled it "the best of Mr. Disraeli's fictions" so far.7 The Literary Gazette found Venetia "redolent of the ge nius of the writer," filled with "finely wrought" and "striking" scenes of "deep feeling" "touchingly told," and literary discussions full of "origi nality and power."8 According to the New Monthly Magazine, Venetia offered its readers "a view of human nature under striking circumstanc es; an intelligent chart of that half-traversed country, the human mind."9 Likewise, the Court Journal found that the "surprises and con tinual excitement, in the progress of the story" would cause the "excited reader [to] feel with Marmion Herbert, and Lord Cadurcis a stronger and more lasting sympathy than ever yet was awakened by the mere heroes of a romance."10 Disraeli's "Byronic conception" found more ad mirers than dissenters, and in fact, the Court Journal speculated — or perhaps hoped — that Disraeli "ha[d] perhaps related more than histo ry has yet told."11 But while Disraeli's Byronism sold books to a nineteenth-century audience still fascinated with the myth of Byron, more recent critics have typically preferred Disraeli's novels that give insight to psychologi cal perspectives or political ideals. In fact,Thom Braun states explicitly that his book is "an attempt to approach a better understanding of Dis raeli the man through his life as a novelist," and "With a few exceptions Disraeli's novels are more important for what they tell us about their author than they are as works of art in their own right."12 Likewise, Daniel Schwartz approaches the novels as Disraeli's working through of 6.

Jane Ridley complains that the novel is "out of character for Disraeli: a novel with no autobiography, no politics, no agenda."14 Oth ers concur: "there is not much to be said in [ Venetias] favor"; the novel is characterized as "hasty and slipshod," a "quick pot-boiler" "written in the shade of the sponging house" whose "scenic descriptions would have been more appropriate in a guide-book" and whose characters "never com[e] to life."15 Like Byron, then, Disraeli's life interferes with the consideration of his texts; and Venetian failure is tied explicitly to its impersonal subject-matter — its interest in imagining a psychology of Byron or Shelley, rather than of Disraeli: It [ Venetia] is an awkward and artificial work, fatally marred by its whole con cept — a fictionalized account of Byron and Shelley put back in the period of the American War of Independence. This involved such liberties with history that contemporary readers simply could not accept it. ... Professor Jerman may be right in seeing in it Disraeli's last tribute to the Byronic myth which had enthralled him since his boyhood, a final protest against the respectable world with which he now had to come to terms. Whatever the motive, the novel, apart from the opening chapters with their charming picture of Vene tia's childhood, is not a success. Lord Cadurcis (Byron) never comes to life, and though it is reasonable to find Marmion Herbert (Shelley) on the side of the American rebels, it is too much to swallow when we read of him as a successful general.16 As a result, the presence of Byronic elements and allusions becomes ample justification for dismissing Venetia, often with little more than a sentence of comment. While Disraeli's use of the Byron legend in Vene tia has been often mentioned, the extent of Disraeli's negotiation of that 13.

Understanding Dis raeli's relation to Byronism, however, requires examining and resolving a number of bibliographic issues, including the extent of Disraeli's re puted bowdlerization of the novel and the ambiguities resulting from a complicated and apparently contradictory composition history. This article proposes first to address these issues, clarifying the nov el's composition history and establishing the authority of the many and varied nineteenth-century editions of the novel. I will then examine Disraeli's relation to Byronism through a survey of revisions to the printed lifetime editions, thus outlining Disraeli's depiction of Byron and By ronism in Venetia. Ultimately, I examine the nature of Disraeli's By ronism by analyzing authorial changes to the MS and comparing the MS with the first edition of Venetia. These changes draw Disraeli's fash ioning of his own text's Byronism into relief. Composing "Venetia" There is little consensus on the composition period of Venetia, with estimates ranging from two to six months — a confusion resulting from apparently contradictory primary evidence.17 A number of critics date the composition of the novel according to Disraeli's recollection in a document commonly known as the Mutilated Diary. In that text under the heading "Autumn of 1836," Disraeli recounts that Venetia was "com menced" during a residence at Kensington Gore in January and early February 1837 during which he "saw of course much of the C[ounte]ss B[lessington]"; "finished" during a convalescence at Bradenham follow ing Disraeli's collapse after canvassing for Harcourt; and published in early May.18 Since Disraeli's letters record that he arrived at Kensington Gore on 17 January and his contract with Colburn stipulated a 1 May deadline, this timeline based on the Mutilated Diary suggests that the composition of Venetia took no more than three and a half months, if Disraeli "commenced" the novel as soon as he arrived at Kensington Gore. Relying on the Mutilated Diary encourages a perception of Dis raeli's work on Venetia as "hasty," and that speed combined with its im Y], Braun posits two months; Bradford, three; Blake, roughly four; and Ridley, a little more than five. 18.

While appealing for its clear-cut statement of times, dates, and plac es, Disraeli's account in the "Mutilated Diary" is problematic. First, it is not a diary in the sense that one would expect, but more of a memoir: entries for this period tend to appear once or twice a year and offer a retrospective summary of events since Disraeli's last entry. For example, the entry for 1834 begins, "And now nearly a year has elapsed. And what an eventful one! Let me sketch it."19 The section concerning Venetia is clearly written at some distance from the original events, for the "Au tumn of 1836" entry catalogues events from August 1836 through "the end of August" 1837. Certainly, the "Autumn" entry could have been written periodically, but the sentence structures suggest its most likely composition to have been sometime bewteen September and early No vember, 1837, but before 12 November, the date of the next "diary" entry. In contrast to the Mutilated Diary, Disraeli's daily correspondence records an earlier beginning for Venetia, one tied closely to the composi tion of Henrietta Temple. Disraeli had originally planned to complete three novels between the fall of 1836 and May of 1837: "If the results are what my publisher anticipates, and I am able to complete this engage ment,! think bet[wee]n £3000 and 4000 might be poured into my coffers by May, but the ships, though built and building, are not yet launched."20 Recognizing that such "almost superhuman labors" would require "a se rene mind and unbroken time," Disraeli retreated to Bradenham from 21 September to mid-October (no. 537). There he described himself as "working unceasingly" to "finish, or nearly so, a second novel for Jan[uar]y, getting the forthcoming one [Henrietta Temple\ out in the very early part of Nov[embe]r" (no. 527). He also expressed hopes that this "serene interval" would allow him to "reap a great harvest" — the monetary im plications of this metaphor being clear (no. 527). In late November, Dis raeli assessed his productivity: "I have not quitted my room for the last ten weeks. I have now written five octavo volumes; i.e. the novel about to be published [Henrietta Temple\, and two more of another [Venetia], which I calculate finishing by the end of the year" (no. 537). Disraeli's attempt to write more than one novel simultaneously ap pears to have delayed Henrietta Temple's debut. Though advertised in 19. Mutilated Diary, Dep. Hughenden 11/1/5, i5r. 20.

That Disraeli had completed two volumes of Venetia prior to his agreement with Col burn isn't unusual, for prior to his agreement for Henrietta Temple, he had confided in Sarah, "I have a vol. by me finished but I did not tell him this" (no. 511). Colburn's "excellent spirits" on the possible sales of such a novel encouraged Disraeli: "[Colburn] says if I can only manage to get out another book this season, of a deep and high interest, he thinks I shall have regained at a bound all the lost ground of the last three years in this sort of work. He has offered me 6oo£ for a novel by the 1 of May, and wishes it to be serious and pathetic" (no. 543). By December 23, within four days of his agreement with Colburn, Disraeli retreated to Bradenham to avoid his creditors and to write, confiding to Pyne on 2 January, "The Muse is, after all, the best of mis tresses, and brings you money as well as pleasure" (no. 548). Venetia owes much of its composition to the influenza "epidemic," which sent Disrae li to his bed at Bradenham from January 4 to 12, giving him "a sort of low, gentleman-like fever that has had hold of me ever since I came down here, and which is not very inconvenient. I have in consequence never left the house, scarcely my room, and it has not incapacitated me from a little gentle scribbling" (no. 555). "Savagely gay" in his seclusion, Disraeli records tremendous productivity: "The quantity I have written, and am pouring forth, is something monstrous. I find it a relief, and now that I have nothing else to distract my thoughts, I am resolved to ruin Colburn" (no. 551). To "ruin Colburn" by forcing him to pay huge royal ties might indicate Disraeli's continuing frustration with Colburn's "con stant fault" — his dilatory payment of Disraeli's agreed-upon royalties, which had required Disraeli to put off paying a number of creditors (no. 546). But by the end of his 8 January letter to Pyne, Disraeli moved from finances to ambition as he discussed his intentions to take rooms first let by Byron, then Edward Bulwer. The thought of moving into the old rooms of great writers leads Disraeli to thoughts of filling their literary 21. BDL 2, no. 528 n2; According to no. 511 (Disraeli to Sarah Disraeli, Carlton Club, 1 July 1836), Henrietta Temple "was to have been published by 1 October.</page><page sequence="9">Byron and Benjamin Disraelis Venetia 457 shoes as well, comparing his "inspiration" to theirs and concluding, "I may flare up yet and surprise you all" (no. 551). This period of intense composition at Bradenham lasted until lyjan uary when Disraeli returned to London to finalize his arrangements with his publisher. At Colburn's he discovers that "nearly 1100" copies of Henrietta Temple "have been sold and it moves yet briskly," an important fact, for the 1,250th copy sold would trigger stipulations in the contract for a second edition and more royalties.22 Despite this fact, or perhaps be cause of it, Colburn who had initially offered £600 for Venetia wrote Dis raeli's contract for only £500, contingent on edition sizes and sales figures.23 From this point, the most significant influence on the shape of Dis raeli's novel and its Byronism comes during this stay in London. Only ten days before, on 27 December, Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington, had written a chiding letter to Disraeli, complaining of the lack of quality in Henrietta Temple-. we [D'Orsay and Blessington] were disappointed with your last book — But why! We expected something very great from you, as that which delights the general class of readers who do not know you, disappointed us who did, be cause we know what you are capable of writing. There are charming passages in the book but you can, and will write something more worthy of you — If I thought less highly of your Genius, I dare not risk telling you this.24 Disraeli responded to Blessington's "lecture"with assurances of his dedica tion to his work on 12 January, five days before he returned to London (no. 22. Disraeli to Sarah Disraeli, London, 17 January 1837, BDL 2, no. 557. The contract for Henrietta Temple is no longer extant in the Hughenden papers, but its terms appear to have been similar to those of Venetia. See note 36. 23. Disraeli to William Pyne, Bradenham, 11 January 1837?, BDL 2, no. 552, re ports that Colburn "has written and made me tempting offers. £800 for the next the 5oo£ place to account, and will make up 800 for H. T. i.e. the copyright of it." Previously, on 19 December 1836, Disraeli had told Sarah that he would receive £600 (BDL 2, no. 543). Disraeli's contract with Colburn, dated 20 December 1836, provided £500 in a promissory note, with the stipulation that the novel must reach a second edition: "£300 to be payable on the first edition if it only consist of 1000 copies, and in this case, 200 on the publication of the second edition. Or £400 to be payable on the first edition should Mr Colburn print 1250 copies and £100 only to be then payable on the publication of the second edition" (Dep. Hughenden 235/3&gt; fol. 155). 24.

Hughenden 119/2, fols. 83-8 (referred to as 26 Dec. in notes to BDL 2).</page><page sequence="10">458 Bibliographical Society of America 555). On his return Disraeli began an extended stay at Kensington Gore, at the Comte D'Orsay's residence adjoining Blessington's Gore House.25 Disraeli's retreat to the rural outskirts of London was largely prompted by the "gloom, the disease, and impending death" the influenza had brought to London: to his sister Sarah he reported that "people die here by doz ens," "pray write me and give me a full report of your population" — and though on 27 January, he indicated showing "some terrible symptoms of the epidemic," he appears to have thrown off the disease quickly.26 Kensington Gore provided a productive retreat, well suited to Dis raeli's needs as a writer: "my own room...has every luxury of writing materials" and "the second breakfast bell sounds just at the time the lion wishes to feed" (no. 559). D'Orsay's establishment allowed him to "write well," and in just one day, Disraeli had added ten more pages to his new novel.27 Most significantly, Disraeli used his residence to draw on Bless ington's knowledge of Byron and his circle to inform Venetia. As the author of the best-selling Journal of Conversations with Lord Byron, Blessington had the reputation for an unusually intimate knowledge of Byron's life and personality.28 The evidence for the value of Blessington's influence on Venetia comes in two letters. First, Disraeli's letter on 13 March indicates Blessington's continuing interest in his work, for he noted that he needed to write Blessington to "tell her how I proceed in literary affairs" (no. 588). The second, written to Blessington "a little more than a fortnight" after his departure from Kensington Gore, de scribed his work on Venetia since his absence (no. 590). Disraeli de scribed Blessington as Venetia's "godmother" to whom he "hope[s] she will prove a source of consolation" (no. 590). 25.

Teresa Guiccioli, Byron's Italian mistress, said Blessington's reminiscences best captured the sound of Byron's voice. Though the amount of time that Bless ington spent with Byron was largely exaggerated, speculation has suggested that Blessington had copied Byron's memoirs during their acquaintance and that his text — burned after his death as a result of Lady Byron's influence — undergirds her work. See Ernest Lovell's edition of Lady Blessington's Conversations of Lord Byron (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1969), and Doris Langley Moore's Late Lord Byron: Posthumous Dramas (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1961).</page><page sequence="11">Byron and Benjamin Disraeli's Venetia 459 Disraeli's "devotion" to his new novel was spurred in part by Blessing ton's own "severe labor," for Disraeli recorded that she "writes ten hours a day," as well as by her income from writing of"2000£ pr. ann." (no. 568). Disraeli also made clear his indebtedness to Blessington, not sim ply for the amenities of his accommodations or the lively conversation in her salon, but for her advice on Byron and Venetia'. " I do not think that you will find any golden hint of our musing strolls has been thrown away upon me, and I shd. not be surprised, if in six weeks, she may ring the bell at your hall door, a request admittance, where I know she will find at least one sympathizing friend."29 This letter also reveals an atypical practice that indicates Disraeli's unusual attachment to his characters in Venetia-. in February, he began to refer to his characters by name, as if they were real persons. On 7 Febru ary, Disraeli reported his work on Venetia has progressed well at Ken sington Gore: "Cad[urcis] has gone to Eton; I am in the middle of the second and the most difficult book, but it is very good indeed, and I think I have overcome all difficulties" (no. 573). On 21 March, he referred to the "fair Venetia" as a "child who has grown under my paternal care as much in grace I hope as in stature, or rather dimensions" (no. 590). As the novel drew close to publication and afterward, Disraeli's rhetoric about Venetia grew consciously anthropomorphic: the novel becomes a "she" who "will make her way," and Disraeli calls her publication, "her birth" (no. 613). Venetia the character and Venetia the novel become one, at least in his correspondence. Between 9 and 15 February, however, Disraeli's "serene interval" at Kensington Gore was increasingly interrupted by his political interests and pecuniary problems in London, and his letters are posted alternately from Kensington Gore and the Carlton Club. A "fierce and unexpected 29. Lady Blessington to Disraeli, Gore House, 27 March 1837, Dep. Hughenden Box 119/2, fol. 91; Lady Blessington to Disraeli, Gore House, 19 March 1837, Dep. Hughenden Box 119/2, fol. 95. Blessington's response to Disraeli's letter is charac teristically encouraging: "It gave me great pleasure to hear from you and to find that the fair Venetia is not thrown aside — I prophesy great things of her, and entreat you to devote yourself heart, and mind, to the completion of so charming a creation" (fol. 91). Within seven days of Venetia s publication, Blessington praises the novel strongly: "It gives me unfeigned pleasure, to tell you, that I have been delighted with Venetia — The interest never flags for a moment, the story is most exciting and the language passionate and eloquent — This book is worthy of you, and must have a brilliant success. No one will more enjoy your triumph than your sincere friend M Blessington" (fol. 95).</page><page sequence="12">460 Bibliographical Society of America contest" in the Aylesbury election and two days of heavy canvassing caused a collapse on 16 February severe enough that he was taken to Bradenham to recover (no. 578). Ten days later on 27 February, claiming he did "not feel at all like an invalid," Disraeli returned to London to deal with the crisis in his finances: apparently his "fit" — and general knowledge of the success of Henrietta Temple — encouraged a number of creditors to call in outstanding debts.30 Out of options, Disraeli re turned to Bradenham on 4 March to arrange "a considerable advance" from his father but remained until 30 March "merely to write."31 Thus much of the "calm" Disraeli had "reckoned on" for finishing Venetia evaporated into weeks of financial negotiations in London and Bradenham (no. 589). In fact, between 7 February and 13 March, Disrae li's letters make no mention of Venetia. To William Pyne, Disraeli ex pressed frustration with not finding "the quiet which composition de mands," leading to fears that he would "not be able to come up to the scratch with Colburn" and a conviction that his "health" was "sink[ing] under" the pressure (no. 589). But to Blessington, Disraeli offered assur ances that his novel was still advancing: "in spite of every obstacle in the shape of harassed feelings and other disagreeable accidents of life, I have not forgotten the fair Venetia, who has grown under my paternal care, and as much in grace I hope as in stature, or rather dimensions" (no. 590). In that letter, Disraeli quoted the text from Childe Harold that would become one of the novel's epigraphs: "the child of love though born in bitterness and nurtured in convulsion." In asserting that Venetia is "truly like her prototype," Disraeli reframed the quotation to refer not to Byron's daughter, but to Disraeli's "child," Venetia, and not to Byron's domestic circumstances, but to Disraeli's own physical and financial woes of the previous months (no. 590). This conflation of Disraeli's literary paternity with Byron's actual paternity, and his woes with Byron's, re veals that Disraeli does not simply use a Byronic context in the novel itself, but he fashions a role for himself (that of Byron) as well. Though making frequent "day trips from Bradenham to London" from 30 March through 5 April, Disraeli felt his contract deadline loom ing near: "I have only one month left to deliver my second novel to 30.

Finishing by 1 May was essential: Disraeli's 20 December 1836 agreement with Colburn — which had gained him a £500 promissory note — stipulated a publication date on or before 1 May, or Disraeli would be required to repay the funds.32 But despite the traumas associ ated with the period of Venetian composition, Disraeli found "undis turbed" "labor" on his novel "pleasant": "I can come to time if I am not disturbed, but that is all: for writing, and writing so much as I am obliged to do requires a composed mind, tho' with that the labor tho' great is pleasant eno'" (no. 591). Disraeli clearly worked on the novel until the last minute, writing on 16 April that he had "only 150 pages or less of my book to finish, which I ought to canter through in the re mainder of the month with ease but I find it difficult to command the Muse amid all these vexations" (no. 601). By this point, with financial pressures rising and his contract deadline approaching, Disraeli's let ters combine confidence and "nervous[ness]": he complains that the "visage[s]" of his creditors "mix themselves up ... with the radiant coun tenance of my heroine": "tho' visions of spunging houses and K[ing's] B[ench] might have been in keeping with the last vol. of Henrietta Temple, they do not accord quite so well with the more ethereal scenes of the fair Venetia" (no. 601). Clearly, any difficulties that Disraeli en countered in the composition of Venetia were related solely to his press ing domestic circumstances; the "fair" Venetia herself appeared to have been a source of pleasure and of pride. This evidence falls in line with Disraeli's recollection years later — in the introduction to the Long mans edition of his Collected Works (1870) — that Venetia was written "with care and some light." The novel arrived at Colburn's on or shortly before 29 April, and apparently Disraeli demanded and won a publication date of 11 May over Colburn's objections.33 But 11 May left Colburn little time for his 32.

With Henrietta Temple, Colburn had offered Disraeli "2 or 3" days to revise the first volume according to the reviewer's suggestions, saying "I can print the book in 2 or 3 weeks, therefore there is no necessity for its going immediately to press" (Col burn to Disraeli, 17 September 1836, Dep. Hughenden 235/3, f°l-160). With Vene tia, Colburn compromised on the publication date — after Disraeli "call[ed] in question" Colburn's "liberality" and "zeal" — but provided little time to revise: "I cannot rush the MS of Vol 2 &amp;3 from the printers" (Colburn to Disraeli, 29 April</page><page sequence="14">462 Bibliographical Society of America typical advertisement and puffing campaign. Advertisements in the Morning Post of 1 May announced that the novel would be available on 11 May.34 In the Literary Gazette, advertisements on 6 May claimed the novel "w[ould] appear immediately"; announcements of the book's avail ability appeared on 12 May, and reminders to purchase, on 20 May. Ve netia may have been rushed through publication in order to coincide with the appearance of Murray's complete-in-one-volume edition of Byron's works: as I have mentioned already, the advertisements play strongly on the Byron connection during the first weeks after publica tion. Though Disraeli's original contract with Colburn titled the novel, "Venetia, or the Poet's Daughter," when the novel appeared, it carried only the name of its heroine on the title-page. Disraeli's composition time, then, extended between six and eight months, and his letters about the novel reveal a strong intellectual en gagement with — even fondness for — his material. Unlike his com ments on Henrietta Temple that concern almost solely its sales, Disraeli appears more proud of Venetia as a novel in its own right. The Problem of an Edition Perhaps another reason that Venetian Byronism has not received more attention is an impression that the novel is not commonly available. For example,Thom Braun, in one of the few book-length studies of Disraeli as a novelist, justifies his decision not to include Venetia on such biblio graphic grounds: "[This] book is about Disraeli as a novelist, rather than about his novels. Many of those works are out of print and have been for some time, and it has not been my aim to write a purely literary study ol novels which are not easily available and which, in any case, are seldom read."35 Braun's justification is a bit disingenuous, however: the idea that 1837, Dep. Hughenden 235/3, f°l- 29~~3°)- Sarah Disraeli had expected to read proofs: "I am glad to hear that the book is really pushing for the eleventh, &amp; am willing to change the pleasure of a solitary proof for the gratification of so soon seeing it altogether" (Dep. Hughenden 7/3, fols. 53-77). By May 3, Disraeli had received proofs up to page 240 (page 109 of the manuscript) and was pleased with where he anticipated volume one would divide (Disraeli to Sarah Disraeli, Lon don, 3 May 1837, BDL 2, no. 606). 34.

For, certainly, Venetia was in print and selling consistently from its original 1837 publication through at least the end of the nineteenth century,36 and Longmans — Disraeli's last publisher — was issuing "new impressions" from its stereotype plates as late as 1919. Though the first edition is difficult to access, a quick survey shows that most university libraries own one of the spate of editions of Disraeli's collected novels.37 If one wished, one could find a copy of Venetia to read or to study. But one will be faced by a bewilder ing number of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century editions by different publishers and find little indication of their relative values, particularly whether a particular edition was authorized by Disraeli or pirated, whether it is a reprint or a new edition. In part Disraeli himself is to blame. Though the history of Disraeli's relations with his publishers has yet to be written, I offer this short over view of his publishing agreements as they relate to Venetia and the other early novels. After Venetian initial Colburn edition in 1837, Disraeli's savvy manipulation of the publishing system kept it and his other novels in print for much of the nineteenth century. In 1845 — eight years after Venetian original publication in 1837 — Disraeli contracted with Col burn to publish a collection of his novels; however, when Colburn had not produced the collection by early 1853, Disraeli "cancelled" the agree ment, and regained the copyrights of those works that Colburn held, mentioning in particular the copyrights of Vivian Grey and Venetia.3S Disraeli then began a series of limited publishing agreements with sev eral publishers in succession, agreements that typically lasted five years. As a result, the number of nineteenth-century editions is bewildering, and given the oft-repeated claim that many of the early novels — if not 36. Figures are not available for all the years of Venetian sales. Between June 1871 and June 1874, Longmans sold 1,120 copies; in 1876 another 200 copies; and a re ceipt dated 8 August 1878 indicates the Modern Novels edition of Venetia sold 1,130 "since mid 1878" (Dep. Hughenden 235/2, fols. 114-55). 37. Most readily available is the 1926 Philip Guedalla edition, which made many silent emendations throughout Venetia s text. 38.

The first publisher with whom Disraeli entered into a limited agree ment was David Bryce, who republished Disraeli's novels from 1853 to 1858. Disraeli's correspondence with Bryce reveals that he revised several of the early novels for this "new" edition. On 25 September 1853, Disraeli reported that he had "reduced" the number of pages in The Young Duke from 830 to 750; and largely as a result of Lucien Wolf's early twentieth century editions of the YoungDuke and Vivian Grey, it became common knowledge that these two novels were, in Blake's words, "drastically re vised" and that other early novels were "similarly 'bowdlerized.'"39 But to what extent the other novels were altered was a question thus far left unexamined and unanswered. Bryce's new edition of Venetia garnered strong public interest. By March 1853, Bryce's sales orders for Venetia exceeded 12,000 copies; an other record indicates that Venetia sold 17,000 copies in only two months.40 By November 1853 Venetia and Henrietta Temple were the top sellers of the group.41 Apparently Disraeli's novels were consistent sell ers, for as his agreement with Disraeli drew to a close, Bryce "beg[ged]" Disraeli to allow him to retain the publishing rights: "Any course that is desirable I am ready to adopt, but I must earnestly entreat that publish ing of the books be not removed from me, else I shall certainly sustain very great injury in the eyes of the trade and of many others ... I again must urgently request that the publication of the book may be left with me a little longer, even though it were only until the end of June."42 Disraeli apparently was unmoved by Bryce's plea, and according to R. W. Stewart, Routledge became Disraeli's next publisher, producing copies of the novels from 1858 to 1863.43 39- Disraeli to David Bryce, Hughenden, 25 September 1853, BDL 6, no. 2557.

In an 18 July 1870 letter, Warne asserted his contractual rights: "if M. Disraeli wishes to prepare with any other house a new edition of the novels — (the present stereos being nearly useless now) we do not desire to stand in his way in the least, but as it is distinctly [understood] in the Trade,... that our tenancy of the Royalty lasts until Xmas, we do not consider it would be advantageous, or conducive to our interest to close it before Deer 30."45 Apparently Warne had received Bryce's stereotype plates when he began his agreement with Disraeli but had reset Venetia in a smaller format for his 1866 edition.46 Warne's last printing of Venetia in 1870, however, offered a re-impression from Bryce's repaired stereotype plates, suggesting that Warne's earlier issues were set from those plates and did not offer revised versions of the novels.47 Disraeli's final lifetime publisher, Longmans, began publishing Dis raeli's works in a Collected Edition in 1870; here, the novels appear to have received further revision, for a T.

Shortly before the end of his contract, Warne apparently purchased a num ber of Longmans editions of Lothair (1870) and published his remaining volumes uniform with the new Longmans edition and placing Longmans's Lothair at the front. This appears to be the act of "chicanery" that causes Philip Rose, Disraeli's agent, to write on 20 January 1871 that Warne "has proved such a weasel" to have "played us the lowest class of trade trick" (Dep. Hughenden 235/2, fol. 149).</page><page sequence="18">466 Bibliographical Society of America that "Mr. Disraeli will send corrected copies of the novels from time to time as suit his convenience."48 Longmans reused its stereotypes of Ve necia until at least 1919, when it issued a "New Impression" from repaired plates.49 Thus, though Venetia appeared with several different publishers over the course of Disraeli's lifetime, the text only appeared in revised edi tions in the 1853 Bryce and the 1870 Longmans — the other printings either setting type from the stereotype plates or repairing and reusing the plates themselves. In fact, once Venetia appeared in print, the revi sions across Disraeli's lifetime remained minor, and they appeared only in the 1853 and 1870 editions.50 None of those revisions focus on the depiction of Byron or Shelley. Given these minor revisions, it seems untenable to claim that the novel was bowdlerized. These two problems together — a confusing publication history and a reputation as a bowdlerized text — seem to have dissuaded any but the most cursory critical comment. Many modern scholars without knowing Disraeli's publishing practice, and without tracing the extent of revisions in his lifetime editions, have relied for their information about the novel largely from the contemporary reviews (several of which are reprinted in Stewart's 1973 Disraeli Reviewed) or the descriptions in Monypenny and Buckle. Given its interrogation of Byron's legend, one would expect the novel to be interesting to scholars even after Disraeli's own reputation as a novelist had faded; but in fact, even Disraeli schol ars have given it little attention.51 When the novel does receive more than a line of commentary, it is typically to notice — usually with deri 48.

Many critics follow William Flavell Monypenny, Life of Benjamin Disraeli (New York: Macmillan, 1910), 360, in giving the wrong title for the book: Disrae li's contract anticipates the title as "Venetia, or the Poet's Daughter," but all of the editions published in Disraeli's lifetime identify the novel simply as Venetia.</page><page sequence="19">Byron and Benjamin Disraelis Venetia 467 sion — the presence of Byron and Shelley in the text.52 Yet such criti cism neither identifies what is particularly Byronic or Shelleyan about the novel, nor examines the significance of Disraeli's refashioning of those characters for Venetia in particular, or for Disraeli's reputation overall.S3 In fact, while most agree that Byron's and Shelley's lives are figured in the text, no one seems quite sure who is who, or how much of one author's life to attribute to a single character.54 Byronism in Published Editions of "Venetia" Part of the problem of examining Disraeli's Byronism seems to be that Byron's life is split over the two male characters. Plantagenet Cadurcis presents Byron's life from childhood through the early years of his exile, while the Italian and Grecian years of the older Byron are all made part 52. Of the Disraelians, Daniel Schwartz has always given the most consider ation to Venetia. His recent "Disraeli's Romanticism: Self-fashioning in the Nov els," in The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli: 1818-1851, ed. Charles Richmond and Paul Smith (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1998), 42-65, argues in a three-page consideration of Venetia that the depictions of Byron "represent" versions of Dis raeli's "self," and Cadurcis and Herbert act as "Disraeli's two surrogates" in a "dia logue between two aspects of himself (53). 53. Recently Venetia has received some consideration from scholars interested in Byron rather than Disraeli. Andrew Elfenbein, "Silver-Fork Byron and the Image of Regency England," in Byromania: Portraits of the Artist in Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Culture, ed. Frances Wilson (London: Macmillan, 1999), 77 92, examines "Byron's reception in early Victorian culture" (78), but his three-page discussion of Venetia is more a directed plot summary than an interrogation of Byron's depiction in the text; Frances Wilson, '"An Exaggerated Woman': The Melodramas of Lady Caroline Lamb," in Byromania, 195-220, offers a provocative three-page reading of performative sexual identity in Venetia based on Disraeli's depiction of Lamb and her relationship with Byron. 54. Teasing out the similarities has been the substance of much speculation. Still useful is Herbert Bruce Hamilton's Ph.D. thesis, On the Portrayal of the Life and Character of Lord Byron in the Novel by Benjamin Disraeli entitled Venetia (Univ. of Leipzig, 1884) which offers correspondences between Disraeli's characters and By ron's life. Monypenny, Life, follows the contemporary reviews and Hamilton in his list of characteristics from the two poet's lives, and most twentieth-century commentary has adopted his list. Ridley offers the extreme position, either replac ing or attaching the character's names with those of their "real-life" counterparts as in "Cadurcis/Byron" (196). Bradford mixes up the attributions altogether, find ing Cadurcis wholly Shelley and vice versa.</page><page sequence="20">468 Bibliographical Society of America of the life of the older Marmion Herbert. Particular alliances between the life of Byron and the childhood of Plantagenet include a variety of telling details. Like Byron, Plantagenet ascends to the lordship as a child; moves to an ancestral ruin of an estate which he adores from a hated small town; and has a tempestuous relationship with his mother. Byron shared his antipathy for that childhood with Elizabeth Pigot, to whose house he frequently escaped, just as Cadurcis escapes to Vene tia's. Both Byron and Plantagenet are lionized (then demonized) for their poetry; both have a mistress who enters their rooms in boy's cloth ing; both reputedly fight duels; and both respond to public acrimony by leaving England. Once in Europe, both men are noted for keeping a menagerie, and both live for a time at an Armenian monastery. Shelley's life appears most in the youthful idealism of Marmion Her bert where he hopes to free men of their political shackles; in fact, a number of Herbert's youthful attitudes place him in the context of the Wollstonecraft-Godwin circle, such as his belief that marriage offers only institutionalized slavery for women. Further, the idealized worlds of Herbert's poetry are reminiscent of Shelley's, just as Herbert's role in the philosophical discussions in volume three, book 6, chapter eight draws on Shelley's Discourse on the Manner of the Ancients. Finally, Her bert's death, by drowning, near Leghorn, evokes Shelley's own. Yet Herbert's mysterious separation from his wife is more Byron than Shelley, and the characterization of Marmion Herbert's mature years owes more to Byron's years in Italy and Greece. Both Herbert and Byron take beautiful Italian mistresses, live in houses associated with a famous writer, act in a war of independence, support a regiment from their own funds, and become military leaders. Given this evocation of Byron's and Shelley's lives, readers have tried to provide a key to the identities of other characters: Lady Annabel is either the deserted wife of Shelley or Byron's widow, Lady Anne Isabel la Noel Byron (called Annabella). Venetia herself is identified with a number of young women: Mary Chaworth, a cousin with whom Byron was infatuated in his youth; Elizabeth Pigot; Ada Byron, Byron's legiti mate daughter by Annabella; or, most oddly, Allegra Byron, Byron's ille gitimate daughter by Clare Claremont.55 Lady Monteagle was "appar 55- Paul Bloomfield, Disraeli (London: British Council, 1961), reprinted in Brit ish Writers and Their Work, no. 9 (Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1965), 21.

However, the manuscript offers tell ing indications both of Disraeli's compositional practice and of his rela tion to Byronism. I will consider first two relatively minor changes in that manuscript — Disraeli's revision of character names — then ex amine how revisions to the characters of Plantagenet Cadurcis and Mar mion Herbert amplify or mute Disraeli's evocation of Byron. From MS to Press: Negotiating Byronism The manuscript of Venetia is part of the Hughenden Manor papers owned by the National Trust and housed at the Bodleian Library. The Hughenden manuscript is incomplete, comprised of roughly 230 leaves measuring 38.5 cm. x 18 cm. and 6 leaves of smaller size, measuring 24 cm. x 14.5 cm. Though numbered according to different systems by three different hands, the extant manuscript leaves correspond to the following sections of the printed book: four leaves from volume 1, book 2; 103 leaves for volume two, book four; 49% leaves for volume three, book five; 77V5 leaves for volume three, book six; and four leaves for volume three, book seven.S7 The large leaves are of the same dimensions and stock as the manuscript pages of Henrietta Temple, published in December 1836, but are used as single leaves instead of folded into folios. Disraeli's practice in Venetia was to use the full length of the recto, but leave the top half of the verso blank for revisions and changes. In fact, this particular manuscript was clearly part of one provided to the print er: the location of each signature is written in as are the names of the various compositors responsible for each section. However, the manu script is not simply a fair copy, as it also reveals revision taking place in the course of its transcription. The first evidences of Disraeli's shaping of Byron's myth in Venetia come in two notable name changes between the manuscript and first edition. In the first, a character named Caroline in the manuscript and based on Lady Caroline Lamb (later Lady Melbourne), an early mis 56. Literary Gazette 1837,3X3&gt; Wilson, "Exaggerated," 211. 57. Dep.

No nineteenth-century reader could mis take the allusion. Disraeli's shift of name allows him to allude clearly to the vagaries of Lady Caroline Lamb while giving him the political dis tance perhaps necessary when characterizing the deceased former wife of the current Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne. Disraeli's move was perhaps doubly politic when one considers that only the year before Melbourne had faced his own scandal when George Norton accused the Prime Minister of an afFair with his wife, writer Caroline Norton, and sued unsuccessfully for damages. But Disraeli's name change also allows the text to characterize Lady Monteagle as politically sawy and power ful, an allusion more to Lady Melbourne (Lamb's mother-in-law) than to Lamb herself, and an acknowledgement of the very real power that women like Melbourne or the Duchess of Devonshire wielded at the turn of the century and that women like Lady Blessington or Lady Hol land continued to wield in the 1830s. Thus the first change offers a greater range of allusiveness to the character. The second, however, points to a specific, but less-well known figure in Byron's life. Disraeli converted the name of a minor friend who accompanies Cadurcis on a duel, from Percy to Scrope. Certainly, the name Percy might appear a too obvious reference to Percy Shelley (just as Disraeli may have changed Caroline to Gertrude solely for discre tion's sake). But it also allows Disraeli to make a direct reference to Scrope Davies, a noted Regency dandy and friend of Byron's. Disraeli seems to have been capitalizing on rumors of a duel that had circulated through Byron's life. By incorporating the incident as well as the name of the friend who supposedly accompanied Byron, Disraeli either gives truth to the rumor or uses that reputed incident to craft his own charac ter's emotional and intellectual background. Disraeli also sharpens the focus of his set of allusions: while Percy might have acted as a pointer to Percy Shelley, Scrope can only point to Byron and to the circle of fa mous men that surrounded him. But Disraeli's many allusions are not limited simply to pointing to characters important to Byron's life. Part of Disraeli's compositional practice also involved reshaping the still current stories of Byron's be</page><page sequence="23">Byron and Benjamin Disraelis Venetia 471 havior in and about town such as those found in volume 2, book 4, chap ter 4. Often, Disraeli takes an initial draft presentation of Plantagenet as difficult to talk to or moody without cause, and revises to emphasize instead Plantagenet's humanity and reserve. At Lady Monteagle's party, for example, the description of Cadurcis at fol. 77" originally read "stand ing apart leaning against a pillar in one of his most studied attitudes, and looking most sublimely melancholy." In revision, Disraeli reduces the emphasis on Cadurcis's performance to mark the necessity of his behavior: "standing apart, apparently wrapt in his own thoughts, but the truth is, in spite of all the excitement in which he lived, he had difficulty in overcoming the natural reserve of his disposition." The narrator then gives the "truth" that Cadurcis is "reserved," not "studied," making his behavior more sympathetic. Likewise, lest Cadurcis' behavior in Lon don society appear overly affected, Disraeli adds that with his old com panions, the "simplicity of old days," "instantly returned on him" (sec ond phrase added at fol. 79v). But at the same time, Byron's aloof or difficult manner gained him great fame, and while Disraeli can soften or humanize, he can't eliminate those characteristics in the stories without losing the focus of his narra tive. Repeatedly Disraeli fine-tunes his depiction of Cadurcis behavior: at fol. 82v, "moody conduct and melancholy strange manners" is replaced simply by "haughty," but "haughty" by itself is apparently not enough, for Disraeli adds "reserved, and melancholy demeanor" as well. When the group approaches Cadurcis to go to a pleasure ground, Disraeli's de scription of his manner at fol. 86r is originally "morose and sarcastic"; in the first revision this becomes "sullen and sarcastic," but apparently that isn't sufficient so Disraeli adds, "and even morose" at the end of the phrase. Likewise, at fol. 78", Mr. Pole's sarcastic description of Cadurcis' behavior in town gains the sentence: "Watch him today, and you will observe that he will not condescend to perform the slighest act like an ordinary mortal." With Marmion Herbert, the revisions take place most frequently in conversations with Venetia or Lady Annabel, typically over his desire to establish a relationship with his daughter. When, for example, Venetia swoons upon first seeing her father, manuscript additions increase Her bert's attentiveness: "her father relaxed his grasp with infinite tenderness, and watching her with the delicate solicitude, rested her on his knee" (ms. addition in italics).58 Disraeli emphasizes the connection Herbert feels 58. Volume 3, book 5, ch. 4, 20v; Disraeli eliminated this MS addition in 1853.</page><page sequence="24">472 Bibliographical Society of America with his daughter by repeatedly adding phrases that signal strong emo tion, such as "with anguish" or "in a tone of infinite anguish," or "in an impassioned voice."59 In fact, in volume three, book five, chapter 5, when Annabel confronts Marmion over Venetia, manuscript additions increase Marmion's distress — his voice "trembled, though the speaker strug gled to appear calm" — and Annabel's cruelty, as she speaks "in a tone of bitter scorn" and stands "rigidly." Further, manuscript revisions shift the attention from "the course of her [Venetia's] natural love" to the ill effects of Lady Annabel's efforts "to curb and control the natural course and rising sympathies of filial love."60 Disraeli's revisions in the printer's copy manuscript then focus on depicting Marmion Herbert as an appropriate and devoted father and by extension offer a vision of what Byron might have been like as a parent to Ada, the issues raised in the epigraphs from Childe Harold. For example, at the beginning of book 6, Marmion Herbert reads aloud to his wife and daughter an extended passage from Don Quixote on the nature of the golden age. This passage is a revision of and addition to the manuscript, written on its own leaf in a different hand, but on the same paper stock as the rest of the manuscript; the speech is edited and al tered in Disraeli's hand. This leaf, labeled Rider X. B., is indicated for insertion on the bottom half of leaf 57 after Disraeli has quoted the first line of Quixote's speech; the top half of fol. 57 has been torn off, suggest ing that Disraeli decided near the bottom of 5 f to add more of Quixote's speech, turned the leaf over to fol. 5 f to do so, but rejected his addition (perhaps due to lack of space). Rider X. B. repeats the part of the quota tion Disraeli has already provided on fol. 57, suggesting that Disraeli asked someone, likely a member of his family circle, to copy out the speech for him without reference to the rest of his draft. In editing and revising Cervantes' speech, Disraeli alters two passag es, one on women's clothing and modesty. Where Cervantes says "clad in no other vestment but what was necessary to cover decently what modesty would always have concealed," Disraeli offers "clad in no other vestment but what the modesty of nature might require." A small change, certainly, but one removing references to "decent" covering and bodily concealment. Disraeli also eliminates almost all of a sentence alluding to 59- Volume 3, book 5, ch. 4, 2ir; volume 3, book 5, ch. 5, if-, volume 3, book 5, ch. 4, 20V. 60.

Patricia Howell Michaelson, in S'peaking Volumes, details how habits of oral family reading placed the father or male family members in positions to read and to comment on the text, to limit the identification women might feel were they to read a part for themselves, and to reinforce hegemonic values.61 The kinds of alter ations Disraeli enacts on behalf of Marmion Herbert are typical of the kinds of omissions Michaelson describes as expected of a father in read ing aloud to his daughter. Disraeli eliminates from Cervantes' text — just as Herbert would have edited from his reading — passages on sexuality. Revising Religious and Political Rebellion Most significant of Disraeli's alterations to the legend of Byron appears in the substantive manuscript revisions of Plantagenet's and Marmion's religious and political tenets occurring in volume 3, book 6, chapter 7, fol. 92. This manuscript section is especially interesting, for it offers lay ers of text. The first layer, a paragraph I will call revision A, is indicated as an addition to the manuscript and is written in Disraeli's hand at the top part of fol. 92v. In my quotation, I have indicated deletions in [], superscript additions in superscript. Revision A reads as follows: the [subject] opinions of Cadurcis respecting religion occasioned her indeed great anxiety. But he was very young and very susceptible and Lady Annabel had lntelllgence sufficient to detected the difference] and appreciate [the difference betw] the distinction between the early skepticism of her husband, based how fatally erroneous on vast learning and deep meditation and the light disbelief of [he] Plantagenet which was rather the result of carelessness than correction and originated [rather] more in the audacity of youthful and arrogant genius than in any fixed ideas. She was sanguine that this sheep would return to the fold where once he had been tended with so much solicitude. And indeed Cadurcis had not entirely emancipated himself from the influence of his early religious education. His mind on this took the color of those with whom he lived and only at the worst was vacillating between doubt and conviction. The second layer of text — which I will call revision B — is a para graph written on a half sheet of the same paper stock as the rest of the manuscript. At its top and bottom edges, revision B is pasted on top of 6i. Patricia Michaelson, Speaking Volumes: Women, Reading and Speech in the Age of Austen (Palo Alto: Stanford Univ. Press, 2002).</page><page sequence="26">474 Bibliographical Society of America Disraeli's revision A. Though revision B is written in a hand other than Disraeli's, revision B is the version included in the first (and every sub sequent) edition of the novel, so regardless of who wrote revision B, Disraeli authorized and repeatedly confirmed its inclusion. In content, revision B strongly alters the depiction of first of Plantagenet's, then Herbert's character: and although [many] some of his rePuted opinions occasioned her doubtless con siderable anxiety, he was nevertheless very young, [unreadable word] and far from emancipated from the beneficial influence of his early education. She was sanguine that this sheep would yet return to the fold where once he had been tended with so much solicitude. When too she [observed]calledtommd the chas tened spirit of her husband, and could not refrain from feeling that had she not quitted him, he might at a much earlier period have attained a mood [of mind] so full of promise and to her so cheering, she could not resist the per suasion that under the influence of Venetia [Most of] Cadurcis might speedily free himself from the dominion of that arrogant genius to which rather than to any serious conviction, the result ofa [a proud and] studious philosophy, she attributed his indifference on the most important of subjects. In both revisions A and B, the paragraph is focalized through the perspective of Lady Annabel who is both religiously and politically con servative. In both her meditations cause her "anxiety," but revision A's "great" is modulated to only "considerable" in revision B — with the shift from "indeed" to "doubtless" in revision B to evoke doubt. In revision A, she meditates on the "light disbelief" of Plantagenet Cadurcis compared with the "early skepticism" education of Marmion Herbert. In both revision A and revision B, Cadurcis's opinions are less studied than Herbert's, resulting not from "serious conviction" and "stu dious philosophy" but rather from a "dominion of arrogant genius," which — in revision B — Lady Annabel believes Venetia may "speedi ly" "influence" to a more "promising" "mood." Cadurcis's opinion then in both are not convictions, but result from ego. In both Cadurcis has not yet returned to Lady Annabel's Anglican fold, but in revision B his opinions are merely "reputed," instead of being "known" as in revision A, suggesting that Cadurcis may in fact not hold such problematic ideas. In revision A, Herbert's "early skepticism" is a "fatally erroneous" sys tem, "based ... on vast learning and deep meditation"; thus revision A presents Herbert's opinions on religion and politics as much more radi cal and problematic than revision B, which eliminates all mention of Herbert's philosophy in favor of his "chastened spirit." In fact, the em</page><page sequence="27">Byron and Benjamin Disraeli's Venetia 475 phasis shifts from describing Herbert's ideals and the strength of his convictions to focus on Lady Annabel and the efficacy of her influence. Lady Annabel even meditates on Herbert's possible conversion as a re sult of his "mood" — a possibility not entertained in revision A: Lady Annabel "could not refrain from feeling that had she not quitted him, he [Herbert] might at a much earlier period have attained a mood so full of promise and to her so cheering." If Cadurcis represents, in part, the moody, difficult youth of Byron, and Marmion Herbert, in part, the revolutionary spirit, revision B offers a softening of both legends, allowing Byron to set aside his youthful ego and become a dedicated father. While Disraeli is modulating the excesses of his Byronic characters in his manuscript revisions, he also adds a chapter that reiterates the identification. Since volume three, book six, chapter eight has appeared in all published editions, I will only mention it as a manuscript addition here. Here Plantagenet and Marmion appear in conversation on a series of philosophical and literary topics. The chapter reinforces its Byronic contexts by evoking popular versions of Byron and Shelley's philosophi cal conversations — as in Shelley's Julian and Maddalo, where Byron plays Maddalo to Shelley's Julian — and their literary conversations, as in the unsigned dialogue "Byron and Shelley on the Character of Ham let," published in the New Monthly Magazine in 1830. Disraeli's contri bution to these conversations diverts attention away from the novel's emphasis on family but emphasizes both Byron's youthful iconoclasm and his relationships with other writers, particularly his admiration for Pope, which both Marmion and Plantagenet share. Modulating Byronism I have outlined above several episodes where Disraeli's manuscript re veals his careful negotiations with the myth of Byron. As I have shown, that manuscript offers greater indications of Disraeli's Byronic fashion ing than do the first or subsequent editions, for the manuscript shows Disraeli in the process of decision-making, considering different ap proaches to and departures from the Byronic myth as he effectively re makes that myth into romance. That romance carefully fashions an imag inary portrait that as the Court Journal hoped, "perhaps tells more truth than has yet been told," suggesting that Disraeli captured something of Byron's personality that biographers in telling the truth had missed.</page><page sequence="28">476 Bibliographical Society of America Venetia is a kind of case study, then, for the kinds of benefits that can be gained by taking a more careful look at Disraeli's manuscripts, which have been historically under-utilized in the interpretation of his novels. In part, that has been the case because his biographers and critics have been more interested in finished products that allow insight into Dis raeli's psychological or political development, rather than in works-in progress that reveal his novelistic practice.</page></plain_text>
