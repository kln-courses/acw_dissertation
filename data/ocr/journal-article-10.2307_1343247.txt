<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chicago Architecture after Mies Ross Miller Ten years after his death Mies van der Rohe is still one of the most imitated architects since Palladio. His own workable architecture and the buildings which he inspired dominate the Chicago cityscape to the point where other solutions to urban architectural problems seem impossible. Chicago, more than any other major American city, developed and applied a consistently well-worked style to such an extent that it has become identified with the prosperous look of the modern metropolis. Mies' prominence in Chicago, however, tends to obscure the work of other important architects. While no single figure has achieved his status, there have been, since 1950, significant challenges to the domi- nant Miesian aesthetic. Bertrand Goldberg, Walter Netsch, Harry Weese, and other second-generation post-Miesians give the city a rich infusion of styles and continue its reputation as a center for innovative architectural ideas. Beginning with the building boom that followed the Fire of 1871, Chicago provided unique architectural opportunities and welcomed wide-range experimentation. From the pioneer work of William Le Baron Jenney's steel frame construction to Frank Lloyd Wright's ma- nipulation of free interior space, the city, at the turn of the century, attracted international attention. Jenney's Home Insurance Building (1884-85), H. H. Richardson's Marshall Field Wholesale Store (1885- 87), John Wellborn Root's Monadnock Building (1891), Charles At- wood's Reliance Building (1885), and Louis Sullivan's Carson Pirie Scott I want to thank the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts for its support. ? 1979 by The University of Chicago. 0093-1896/79/0602-0006$01.58 271</page><page sequence="2">272 Ross Miller Chicago Architecture after Mies Store (1899) were a few of the distinguished applications of new building technology. The steel frame, the electric elevator, and the development of reinforced concrete foundations gave the early modern architects the freedom to build ever larger structures. The skyscraper, developed in Chicago to accommodate an increasing urban population within the economic restrictions imposed by declining land reserves, was both an aesthetic success and a commercial necessity. The city's second great period of architectural expansion occurred after World War II. Chicago's urban renewal programs alone (1951-71) used one and a half billion dollars in federal, local, and speculative funds. Capital was available for large-scale building. Commercial firms like Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, C. F. Murphy, and Perkins and Will worked at an increasingly ambitious pace. The John Hancock Center (1968), the Standard Oil Building (1973), and the Sears Tower (1974) gave Chicago a monumentality that at one time was exclusively as- sociated with New York. Miesian building with its characteristic steel cage, curtain wall, ex- pensive appointments, and meticulous attention to detail is now the standard solution to the problems of public architecture. The concentra- tion of buildings in the Loop and the expansion up Michigan Avenue by Mies and his imitators have given a unity to the city that complements the early skyscraper designs of Jenney, Root, and Sullivan. It is an architecture with an undeniable majesty. The interplay of various building materials (steel, aluminum, glass, and marble) seems to give life to the inanimate. Mies' Illinois Institute of Technology campus (1942-58), the 860-80 Lake Shore Drive apartments (1952), and the Federal Center (1964) seem static in their strict geometry of right angles but manage a dance of shadows that gives each work a dynamic quality. The glass is at first transparent and then opaque-wholly dependent on the angle of the sun or the viewer's perspective. At night these same buildings have a completely different reality when they are purposely lighted and reflected (Mies often used a reflective material on the win- dow rooms) from the inside out. When Mies came to Chicago in 1938 to become director of the Armour Institute (IIT), he had two decades of experience with what has come to be known as international style architecture. In Berlin Mies was a member of the Novembergruppe (1918), the first vice-president of the Ross Miller teaches English and American studies at the University of Connecticut. He is currently writing a book on the roots of contem- porary architecture in Chicago.</page><page sequence="3">Critical Inquiry Winter 1979 273 Deutscher Werkbund (1926-32), and, in Dessau, the director of the Bauhaus (1930-33). His arrival in Chicago coincided with a particularly chaotic period in the city's architectural development. No clear style had emerged to compete with that of the 1890s. A return to neoclassicism inspired by the Columbian Exposition that initially stifled the develop- ment of new design became by the 1920s neglected itself. Prairie school architecture, patterned after Frank Lloyd Wright, was more suitable to a domestic scale and not readily applicable to commercial building. Yet in the ten years before Mies arrived there was a flowering of experimenta- tion. Examples from this period include Howard T. Fisher's interesting work on prefabricated housing, George Fred Keck's glass and steel Crys- tal House for the Chicago Century of Progress Exhibition (1934), which explored the possibilities of machine-crafted design, and Andrew Re- bori's eccentric use of building forms in the Frank Fisher Apartments (1936). None of these architects, however, designed works that com- municated a particular look or imparted a special tone to a city. After the best work of Sullivan, Root, and Wright was completed and until the arrival of Mies Chicago lacked an immediately identifiable style. Mies found an ideal home in Chicago. By 1938, the city's hard- edged engineering tradition, made into architecture during the last two decades of the nineteenth century, had lost its coherence and direction. To this confusion Mies brought a polish and daring that worked within an easily applied system of industrial production. His method, which combined classical balance and proportions with the modern preference for volume over mass, is best illustrated in his German Pavilion for the Barcelona International Exposition (1929). The Pavilion was a synthetic reduction of neoclassical ideas of the early-nineteenth-century German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the volumetric interiors of Frank Lloyd Wright. Together with Mies' earlier work at the Stuttgart Werkbund Exposition (1927), it established him as a major theoretician. Unlike the European Beaux Arts tradition which was rooted historically and culturally, the method Mies was perfecting was as close as one could get in built architecture to pure abstraction. His buildings appear to be perfect solutions, combining a sensitive choice of materials with the simplest use of form, and can be copied in New York, Berlin, and To- kyo; free of historical imaging they have no specific locale. His ideas were attractive to a city like Chicago which once before, after the Great Fire, had been recreated in a completely new way. The director of IIT was admired for his tendency to search out universally applicable solutions to problems. By 1938, Mies' own designs had not undergone the compromises of the work of some of his contemporaries. For example the German Pavilion in Barcelona, a glass temple placed on a classical pedestal of travertine, was an academic exercise; a model dis- assembled, crated, and shipped back to Germany after the Exposition</page><page sequence="4">274 Ross Miller Chicago Architecture after Mies closed. Its short life only heightened Mies' mystique by making his style even less grounded in the capricious day-to-day moods of fashion. There was no permanent structure left to compete with the pure abstraction of the recollected design. By the time the principles represented by the Pavilion were applied to actual commissions (first in the Tugendhat house [1930] and later in the Farnsworth house [1950]), his reputation assured him free rein. Postwar Chicago, which required a ready and accessible style to meet the expansion of its growing commercial center, offered Mies a similarly congenial environment for his architectural ideas. Mies pro- vided Chicago of the 1950s and 1960s with an immediately respectable order-a building form that accommodated any number of business demands. In effect, Mies provided profitable high-rise lofts that could be subdivided to meet the special needs of the client. His work grew because it encouraged the anonymous commercial expansion of the time. In practical terms he was able to turn such complete acceptance into a laboratory for his architectural concepts. While most architects are forced to work inductively from the nature of the site through the com- promises imposed by shrinking budgets and the shape of the existing man-made environment, Mies had the freedom to work deductively. Large budgets and public receptivity allowed him to impose directly architectural ideas that he had been developing for three decades. With very few alterations the Miesian abstractions of the 1920s became the everyday reality of the city of Chicago. For Mies it was a complete con- firmation of long-held beliefs, but for the first generation of postwar architects (Goldberg, Netsch, and Weese), such a dominant aesthetic became a challenge. Goldberg, Netsch, and Weese questioned the universal applicability of rigid I beams, glass curtain walls, and orthogonal design. Bertrand Goldberg, in particular, has made the strongest, most sustained anti- Miesian statement. A former German Bauhaus student of Mies, Goldberg went on to design Marina City Towers (1960; fig. 1). Two large corncob-shaped skyscrapers with distinctive cantilevered petals of poured concrete that form the balconies of individual apartments suggest the curve of the Chicago River below. These great cylinders are in dramatic contrast to the steel cages of postwar Chicago. Marina City is as significant historically as it is architecturally. It marks the first major non-Miesian building in the commercial core of Chicago. Rather than impose a predetermined system, Goldberg's plans evolved from the immediate need for enlarged floor space in an inner- city residential structure. The post and beam steel-frame technology refined by Mies in his Promontory Apartments and 860-80 Lake Shore Drive Apartments during the early 1950s no longer proved economical. Goldberg's curvilinear design-supported not at the periphery but</page><page sequence="5">;i: :::i !iiii i :iii'i 4! -IN  - !k FIG. 1.-Marina City Towers. Bill Engdahl, Hedrich-Blessing.</page><page sequence="6">276 Ross Miller Chicago Architecture after Mies braced by a central steel core-multiplied the actual usable space without inflating the project's cost beyond the middle-income range. In 1963 Goldberg applied and refined a similar method to a housing project for elderly and low-income tenants. "Environment," Goldberg explained, "is a primary part of the architectural design and eventuates its own structure. In the Marina City Towers, the environment is optimal for the family without children. I did not replicate it in the Hilliard Center apartments where it was much more important to establish the individual identity of each family with children. In other words, I defi- nitely have tried not to reduce all solutions for family life down to one fundamental spatial method."' The plan appears to have worked. The Hilliard Center has not suffered the trashing and vandalism or racial imbalance of other contemporaneous projects, most notably the city's massive Robert Taylor Housing built on an uninspired rectilinear grid. At the Hilliard, structural slipform petals bear the building's complete load and eliminate the central steel core of the earlier Marina Towers. By applying the right technology to specific client needs, Goldberg was able to create more space at a competitive cost while still attending to the building's required social function. The elegant but anonymous loft space provided by the Miesian model had proved inadequate for mass housing and increasingly dull for commercial architecture. Where Mies had the architect assume a priestly function, handing down the law, Goldberg questioned the architect's role.2 Goldberg thought of the modern architect, in the manner of Burnham, Root, and Sullivan, as a mediator between a sensitive client and a difficult but always inventive technology. In this way the design is shaped, ideally, by the project, and the architect's role as innovator and experimenter is necessarily affirmed. Goldberg was as obstinate in his quest of the curve as Mies was in his refinement of the right angle; Goldberg's peculiar curved forms are part of the standing record of the early postwar debate over the shape and function of design and implicitly criticize not Mies but the institutionalization of Mies' style. This search for new forms in reaction to Mies and his followers can be found in the work of Walter Netsch as well. Like Goldberg, he did architecture outside the rules of a preordained orthodoxy, and, also like Goldberg, his recent adoption of an orthodoxy of his own should not obscure the freshness and influence of his early work. 1. Quoted in John W. Cook and Heinrich Klotz's Conversations with Architects (New York, 1973), p. 124. 2. Goldberg, of the three early Miesian critics, has the most comprehensive social program. His River City plan, a proposed development for 230 acres of old Chicago freight yards between Harrison and 16th Street on the banks of the Chicago River, is an attempt to combine architecture with large-scale social planning. The plan extends the technology of Marina City Towers to a complex of multiuse facilities which are self- sufficient but still linked organically to the city around it.</page><page sequence="7">Critical Inquiry Winter 1979 277 Netsch, a longtime partner in the Chicago office of Skidmore, Ow- ings and Merrill, was primarily concerned with the way in which ar- chitecture is experienced. More academic than either Goldberg or Weese, he worked to provide a constantly changing field of visual rich- ness. Netsch found the simple and direct linearity of Miesian architec- ture monotonous when repeated ad infinitum upon the grid of Chicago and chose to replace it with a more demanding geometric system, a method that he began to develop during his work with the Air Force Academy Chapel in Colorado Springs (fig. 2), which was designed during the 1950s. Netsch intended the chapel to break up the sameness of the "orthogonal environment."3 By experimenting with the chapel, which remains his single most successful building, and with the Grinnell Stu- dent Center in Iowa, Netsch applied "multiple geometric orders" to vary the effect of the dominant straight-line approach of most of his con- temporaries, including those from Skidmore, Owings and Merrill who worked with him on the extensive Colorado Springs campus. The effect at the U.S. Air Force Academy is dramatic; the chapel is the one building amidst a sterile complex of faceless, depersonalized forms to have any real vitality. A series of three types of aluminum clad tetrahedrons rises from a formal base. The spaces between the supporting members are glazed with stained glass. Where at Ronchamp Le Corbusier used a streamlined metaphor of hands in prayer, Netsch made the same devotional pose of hands metallic and dynamically flexed. Seventeen separate points of equal height, identically spaced, turn the anthropomorphic form into pure geometry. By asking the question "What kind of space does an odd-shaped room give you?" Netsch went on to bolder experiments. His work evolved into what he calls "field theory," a manipulation of forms which involves the overlaying and rotation of squares of identical or different sizes to generate a new grid of mathematically related diagonals. Whereas Mies exploited the possibilities of the right angle and Goldberg exploited those of the circle, Netsch was dedicated to searching out the properties of the forty-five-degree angle. Although Netsch's use of inter- locking diagonals provides wider possibilities than the repetition of ninety-degree corners or the exclusive use of the curve, it does not, unfortunately, provide the necessary regularity essential to successful design. Netsch counters by explaining, "I'm sometimes criticized for developing a style which is a little too fussy or complex. But I suppose in the long run I have Wright behind me in the sense of complexity as an acceptable mode in American architecture." 3. Unless otherwise noted, all quotes refer to interviews I had with the principal architects during the week of 16 October 1978.</page><page sequence="8">278 Ross Miller Chicago Architecture after Mies FIG. 2.-Air Force Academy Chapel, Colorado Springs, Colorado. But Wright never created the kind of "optical shock" that has been associated with some of Netsch's work.4 Netsch has not been able to duplicate the effective combination of both complexity and clarity that he achieved in his earlier and less radical Air Force Academy Chapel. When applied in Chicago to the Circle Campus of the University of Illinois (fig. 3), which was opened in 1965, Netsch's field theory gets out 4.

In effect, Netsch's response to Mies was to replace the universal simplicity of an easily replicated method with one of his own that is almost im- possible to duplicate. The well-intentioned geometry at Circle Campus is overwhelming in scale and form but lacks any of the relief Netsch was able to provide the austere Academy campus. Instead of the microcity Netsch envisioned, Circle Campus is a com- pression, an apparent collapse of forms upon themselves. Seen from the air it has the forbidding look of a desert fortress-granite and hard-cut concrete extend into the grayness of the surrounding area. One is not freed from the "orthogonal determinism" of Mies but is more often thrown into a funhouse of forty-five-degree angles which are almost impossible to assimilate. Part of the problem is that Netsch, now allowed to build completely within his own system, no longer provides the more conservative, straight-lined, visual orientation seen, for instance, in the conventional parts of the Air Force Academy campus. "A stabilizing frame comparable to that found in Muslim pattern design is omitted, and the result is disorientation as a normative condition."6 Netsch's theories work better in plan than in execution. His recent additions to the Chicago Art Institute show the same compulsion to make the simple complex. In freeing himself from one system, Netsch has locked himself into another. Of the three first-generation Miesian critics in Chicago, only Harry Weese achieved a true freedom from system. Weese's work is historically important because he succeeded in consciously avoiding Mies entirely, an act that was nearly impossible in Chicago of the 1950s: "Mies worked on us all. But it became quite clear to me that Mies himself didn't believe what he said about functional and machine architecture when he started hanging decorative I beams all over everything." Weese began his career by building houses for his banker father and found increasing acceptance outside the city. His subsequent work in Columbus, Indiana gives an idea of the range of his experiments. Be- tween 1957 and 1968 he was responsible for eleven buildings. This pro- gressive city gave Weese a chance to build away from the hothouse competition of Chicago. Taken as a group, the work in Columbus re- flects Weese's sensitive and restrained use of glass and his reintroduction of brick as an appropriately modern building material. He self- consciously avoids the kind of compulsive detailing that we associate with Mies' work. In this way Weese is more like Alvar Aalto in his preference 5. C. Ray Smith, in Supermannerism: New Attitudes in Post-Modern Architecture (New York, 1977) and Nory Miller, in "Evaluation: The University of Illinois' Campus as Urban Design," American Institute of Architects Journal 66, no. 1 (January 1977): 24-31, discuss some of the problems from both a design and functional point of view. 6. Drexler, p. 28.</page><page sequence="11">Critical Inquiry Winter 1979 281 for large broad-faced facades, high-pitched Scandinavian roof lines, and strongly massed forms that appear to emerge from below grade. Weese learned a lesson out in Columbus that few of his contemporaries in Chicago fully understood. Even in the shadow of Mies van der Rohe, an architect with the right client could build as he pleased. Back in Chicago Weese's work took on a more deliberate, de- termined quality. Seen in the light of the larger tradition of Chicago architecture, Weese's building had a polemical edge. Initially less con- cerned with structural or formal innovation than either Goldberg or Netsch,7 Weese's work had a much stronger link with the classic Chicago tradition (1880-1900). His architecture looked back as well as forward. He revived interest in Chicago's usable past, not as an antiquarian or preservationist, but as an architect dedicated to searching out workable solutions to urban design problems wherever he found them. Weese was initially impressed with the classic period's light-seeking quality, the way Chicago buildings of the 1880s and 1890s had open bays and long "Chicago windows" to increase the use of available sunlight. While it is true that Mies solved this problem of poor sunlight by hanging a sheer curtain wall of glass, he also obscured a valid design tradition in the city. Weese's apartments at 227 East Walton (1956; fig. 4), dra- matically situated near Mies' 860-80 Lake Shore Drive Apartments (fig. 5), reestablished the heliotropic bays of Atwood's Reliance Building. The larger oriel windows break up the monotonous flat facades associated with residential buildings of the same period, and Weese used them again in the Chicago Teachers' Union (1960-66) and the University of Chicago's Stanley R. Pierce Hall (1959-61).8 Weese continued to quote Chicago's architectural past in the struc- ture of his buildings as well. He preferred the street level scale of load- bearing walls to the contemporary screen of steel and glass. Weese, by using brick and concrete to take the weight of the structure, gave the impression of an older, more personal, and less intimidating scale in his residential architecture. This was especially apparent when he con- structed smaller, intimate projects like the Old Town apartments (1960-61). Through all his architecture he has shown a willingness to 7. Some of Weese's buildings during the '50s and '60s, like the First Baptist Church in Columbus, Indiana (1962-65) and the United States Embassy in Ghana (1957-58), showed a stronger spirit of experimentation than those he built in Chicago. This has now changed with Chicago's U.S. Courthouse Annex (1971-75), a bold, triangular building which trans- forms a dismal urban site. 8. It is interesting to note that as Weese increased the scale of these projects, the effectiveness of the principles decreased. On a small scale the historical quoting works both as a reminder of the past and as good contemporary design; but as the scale gets larger, as in the Chicago Teachers' Union, the style seems less appropriate, a little awkward and monolithic. In this way the use of a high-tech version of the "Chicago window" in Weese's Time-Life Building (1968) is too self-conscious a gesture to be totally convincing.</page><page sequence="12">..... ..... .. .. .. . 10 23?

Photo by Hedrich-Blessing. question the fashionable assumptions of his contemporaries; of the three important first-generation Miesian critics, Weese has had the strongest influence on the current group of Chicago architects. This second generation of post-Miesians has applied Weese's eclec- ticism to contemporary problems of their own. Due to the work of Goldberg, Netsch, and Weese, Chicago of the 1970s is a much freer architectural environment than it was twenty years ago. The city is now witnessing a new level of experimentation and a renewed interest in the process of architecture that as a community it has not seen since the 1890s. Stanley Tigerman, a Chicago-born architect, is an important part of this second generation of post-Miesians. He understands the nature of</page><page sequence="14">284 Ross Miller Chicago Architecture after Mies Mies' influence on his contemporaries-those young architects born in the 1930s and educated in the 1950s. In fact his Boardwalk Apartments (1974) is designed with a Miesian discipline (a relatively low $15.96 per gross square foot) and with the same sensitive attention to detail that is so apparent in Mies' own Lafayette Park in Detroit (1960). By brazenly copy- ing, Tigerman allows us to see both the advantages and disadvantages of replicated design in the same way the pop artist, by recreating it exactly, reveals to us a familiar object. Such overt imitation draws less attention to the product than it does to the process of replication itself, and thus Tigerman makes us think about how we think about architecture.9 Heretofore, American architecture has always been a given-an aesthetic solution to shelter, space, and economics-that has been im- posed by the architect and agreed to by the client. Yet the man-made environment where people live their lives has been neither understood nor appreciated. The processes of architecture and design decisions are apparent only within the arcane proceedings of city planning commis- sions and boards of estimate. Tigerman understands this situation, and, through the presentation of his own work and that of a group of young architects, he has tried to amend it.10 Tigerman's model, plans, and isometric sections for a "Little House in the Clouds" at the Seven Chicago Architects show present the ar- chitect's own thinking in process. The house is split down the center into two symmetrical halves. Only one half is a conventional shelter of man- made materials; it is mirrored by a topiary, cut and pruned, to echo the house's exact form. Both structures-natural and man-made halves of a jigsawed whole-seem poised for movement. By shaping trees to reflect a man-made form, Tigerman reverses the romantic habit of architec- ture's self-conscious imitation of nature and affirms the contemporary prominence of technology as an inescapable fact of modern life. Through this dramatic inversion of influence (nature/culture), Tiger- man has forced his viewer into an active participation not merely with 9. He has accomplished this both in his own architecture-most notably in the sensi- tive application of curvilinear design in the Illinois Regional Library for the Blind and Handicapped (1977)-and in his support of extra-architectural events. In 1976, he orga- nized an architectural show, "Chicago Architects," to compete with "One Hundred Years of Architecture in Chicago," a presentation at the city's Musuem of Contemporary Art. Tiger- man, objecting to the Museum exhibit's thesis that there was a linear development of one main style from Sullivan to Mies, argued in his own show that Chicago's past was richer and more eclectic. See Stuart Cohen's Chicago Architects (Chicago, 1976); and Oswald Grube, Peter Pran, and Franz Schulze's 100 Years of Architecture: Continuity of Structure and Form (Chicago, 1976). 10. Under the name "Chicago Seven" he has increased public awareness of the way architects work. First in a show, "Seven Chicago Architects," at the Richard Gray Gallery (December, 1976), and recently in "Town Houses," at the Graham Foundation (18 May through 16 June 1978), Tigerman and his coexhibitors have demonstrated the variety of solutions to the same architectural commission.</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry Winter 1979 285 the model at hand but with the whole modern movement exemplified in Chicago by Mies van der Rohe. Mies' disciplined retreat from romantic or individual influence created the illusion of an objective architectural order. Miesian architec- ture seemed fated, and the public was asked to accept it as afait accompli. In contrast, Tigerman's "Little House" and the designs of Laurence Booth, Thomas Hall Beeby, Stuart Cohen, James Freed, James Nagle, and Ben Weese are not dependent on their ever being produced. They need not exist in actuality but only in process because their self-conscious styles serve a heuristic purpose. The Chicago Seven exhibitors present an architecture that cannot be understood apart from the ideas which underlie it. The audience is directly involved in architectural creation and leaves such an exhibit better prepared to evaluate the man-made envi- ronment. The work is revealed to the audience at its earliest moment of creation and serves as a modest but important first step at demystifying architecture and the entire design process. Conceptual architecture-distinguished from work rendered for particular clients-reveals the fundamentally dialectical nature of con- temporary architecture. The linking of method, the way an architectural idea evolves (sketches and notes), to product (model and working prints) accentuates the art's dynamic quality. Design in this way is seen not merely as a supraorganizational framework capable of defining large areas of urban or exurban space but as a problem-solving tool that can be sensitively applied to meet the specific needs of an individual or commu- nity. Modern design in Chicago can no longer be viewed as the Miesian a priori application of principle. The rigidities of one proper style have given way to a variety of architectural styles and strategies. Each one of Tigerman's coexhibitors has a different approach to design. Laurence Booth and James Nagle, in practice together, have built interesting in- town and suburban structures influenced by East Coast architects Richard Meier, Michael Graves, and Robert Venturi. Booth's work espe- cially is evolving into a modernist synthesis of contemporary modular grid planning and formal classical organization. Ben Weese, formerly in practice with his brother Harry, has been working on small-scale projects with a particular sensitivity to rehabilitating anonymous structures which have come into disuse. His reconstruction of the Bradford Exchange in Niles, Illinois, in which a 20 by 108 foot skylight was built with a garden placed beneath it, is a particularly good example of a discarded strip discount store transformed into an office and display space. Thomas Beeby's work has taken a different direction. Although his conceptual designs-a free form "House of Virgil" complex on a rural Midwest site-are more organic than his built architecture, his recent work has been gradually moving away from rigid orthogonal architec- ture. The recently completed corporate offices for Hewitt Associates in</page><page sequence="16">286 Ross Miller Chicago Architecture after Mies Lincolnshire, Illinois reveals this development in process. Here Beeby has managed an effective undulating facade by alternating natural wood and industrial facings. In plan, the building has a disjointed cruciform design with two rectilinear wings at right angles to each other which are balanced by two curvilinear wings of different size and shape. The struc- ture, on an attractive wooded site, exploits the tension between curved and straight-line forms in a compelling way. While Chicago architecture of the 1970s has been going through an eclectic period not unlike the one it experienced in the 1920s and 1930s, it is possible to see within it some direction. While Chicago will never again experience the single-mindedness of purpose associated with Mies van der Rohe, there are very strong elements of design developing. The work of Helmut Jahn, which bridges that of the Miesians and the second-generation critics, is instructive in this regard. Jahn is a design partner at C. F. Murphy-one of the oldest and consistently Miesian firms-and has exhibited with the Chicago Seven group. His own career reflects some of the shifting values apparent in Chicago's current ar- chitectural environment. Born in Germany in 1940, Jahn came to Chicago in 1966 to do graduate work at IIT after graduating from Technische Hochschule in Munich. His first Chicago commission was as Gene Summers' assistant on the McCormick Place exhibition hall (1970), which is one of the most beautiful applications of Miesian principles to the problem of loft space. A roof of 1350 by 750 feet, cantilevered a distance of 75 feet, indicates the immense size of the project. The decision to reveal the structure of the entire building-the inside and outside are identical-provided this gargantuan form with an unusual lightness. From his experience with McCormick Place, Jahn learned the limits of Miesian design. When he went on to assist Jacques Brownson on the Auraria Higher Education Center in Denver (1973-76), he took a ba- sically set plan and augmented it in critical ways. He put an aluminum and glass skin around the library, adding brise-soleil to protect against glare and to give the building a greater visual energy, and still respected the ordered use of concrete columns which are a part of the larger complex." Both Summers and Brownson were ideal teachers of the Miesian system for they, more than Dirk Lohan or others in the Office of Mies van der Rohe, had internalized the principles without repeating the entire liturgy. When Jahn followed Summers and Brownson as principal designer at C. F. Murphy he was relatively free to pursue his own course. 11. Werner Blaser, in After Mies: Mies van der Rohe, Teaching and Principles (New York, 1977), sees Jahn's library as a "foil" to the "dark earth-colored brick buildings" on the rest of the Miesian grid (p. 274). In a sense, Jahn's subsequent designs, always Miesian in detail, are foils to the more austere Miesian buildings of a generation ago.</page><page sequence="17">Critical Inquiry Winter 1979 287 Both the Kemper Arena in Kansas City (1976) and the St. Mary's Athletic Facility in South Bend Indiana (1977) reveal an exuberance that we associate with the best of Chicago architecture. The Kemper Arena takes the long-span problem Jahn faced at McCormick Place and solves it in an entirely new way. Here the structure is revealed in the form of three extruding tubular truss systems that brace the roof and give a muscular unity to a potentially passive design. The St. Mary's Athletic Facility was a similar commission to which Jahn brought a different solution. He introduced bright red colors to code the structural part of the building.12 Steel trusses span 120 feet at 20 foot spacings. They cantilever at each end 7? feet to support curved acrylic glazing and insulated translucent fiberglass panels. The controlled curve at the end and the use of bright colors as design elements are part of Jahn's emen- dation of the Miesian canon. This synthesis of Miesian and contemporary Chicago design can be seen most clearly in the Monroe-Dearborn Office Building (Xerox Centre) now under construction (fig. 6). Faced with the problem of a tall, high density skyscraper on a busy site, Jahn solves it in a way that is as historically sensitive as it is futuristic. What strikes one immediately is the fashionable, high-tech glow of the aluminum and glass skin-Star Wars on the Loop. But the alternation of metal and glass is not simply done for effect; it reinforces the distinct curvilinear shape and highlights the building's horizontal axis, which is unusual in high-rise structures. For energy considerations the east, south, and west sides have fifty percent glass while the north and the curve have seventy-five percent.'3 The Miesian influence is apparent in the choice of high technology industrial materials and the care in detailing, while the use of the curve is more reminiscent of Mendelsohn and Oud than it is of Goldberg or the early cylindrical skyscraper design of Mies. The arrangement of these mate- rials, however, is Jahn's own. Not immediately apparent are the more subtle historical influences; it is here that Jahn links up with an older Chicago architectural tradition. His use of a congested urban site, the way the building turns the corner at Monroe, suggests the sweep of Louis Sullivan's Carson Pirie Scott 12. Experimentation with color is one the most important innovations of the second- generation post-Miesians. Tigerman's use of color in the Regional Library, Beeby's use of earth tones in the Hewitt Building, and Booth's application of Renaissance (Palladian) colors in his Adamson House in Lake Forest, Illinois dramatically contrast with the mono- chromism of early modern design. 13. Energy considerations such as these have completely dominated Jahn's planning for the Argonne Program Support Facility, Chicago Branch. Done in cooperation with the Department of Energy-using solar energy and "passive" (architectural) strategies-this building should be the most energy efficient structure ever designed in this country. The commission reveals Jahn's flexibility as an architect and shows him as much more than a stylist.</page><page sequence="18">=Now=l . . . ......... . . eggs ::Xn :XmX .!ii  :x,: L' dl e m I- -- 07 .. ........ .. ..... ....... .

Xerox Centre also reminds us of Sullivan in Jahn's close atten- tion to the way the building works at street level. Too many tall buildings are designed from the sky down with little concern for the way such giant forms meet the street. In contrast, Xerox Centre, like Carson Pirie Scott, creates a natural pedestrian area and avoids the forced plazas of most skyscrapers. Jahn is part of a diverse group of second-generation modern Chicago architects who have applied to their own work the example of design autonomy provided by Goldberg, Netsch, and Weese. Chicago to the modern architect had for too long been considered an architectural holy land, an Angkor Vat on Lake Michigan. The enormous presence of Mies-once a stimulus to creative architectural thinking-had become a hindrance. But as we have seen, there is a new spirit of introspection and innovation in the city. It is more than fitting that Chicago, a city im- placably linked with the American architectural past and a key to its future, should welcome this renewal.</page></plain_text>
