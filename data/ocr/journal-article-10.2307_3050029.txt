<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Abstract Vision of Marius de Zayas Willard Bohn "There were dadaists before the name Dada existed for Dada, before the dadaists were Dada," Jean Arp once declared with a paradoxical flourish. The critic and Sur- realist writer Jose Pierre is more specific: "If the term was invented in Zurich, the Dada spirit first became evident in New York... Baptized in Switzerland in 1916, the infant (conceived in Paris) was actually born in New York in 1915."' While Francis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp were the catalysts in New York, frequenting the Stieglitz and Arensberg circles, numerous Americans made important contributions as early as 1912. One of these was Marius de Zayas (1880-1961) who, as Alfred Stieglitz's closest associate, was responsible for many of the achievements usually credited to his chief. De Zayas's background was as varied as his interests. Born into a cultured and artistic family in Veracruz, Mex- ico, he became an illustrator and caricaturist for El Diario in Mexico City. When in 1907 the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz forced his family to flee to the United States, he found a similar position on the New York Evening World.2 Depicting personalities of the day with great verve and humor (Figs. I and 2), de Zayas seems to have become something of a celebrity almost immediately.3 Shortly af- ter his arrival in New York, he made the acquaintance of Alfred Stieglitz, who greatly esteemed his caricatures. His first one-man show at "291" was in January, 1909, followed by two others in 1910 and 1913. In the ensuing years de Zayas wrote a number of articles for Camera Work and other magazines, acted as European agent for Stieglitz, edited the review 291, and opened two galleries of his own: the Modern Gallery (1915-18) and the de Zayas Gallery (1919-1921). His book, A Study of the Modern Evolution of Plastic Form (co-authored with Paul B. Haviland in 1913), is one of the earliest American at- tempts to understand modern art. His African Negro Art, Its Influence on Modern Art (1916) ranks as one of the first studies anywhere of primitive aesthetics. Catherine Turrill expresses the critical consensus when she remarks that "Marius de Zayas' chief importance for the avant- garde art movement in America lay not in his work as a caricaturist but in his activities as an art dealer and in his association with several art-related publications."a In fact, as the present study is intended to show, his caricatures were every bit as important as his other accomplishments. The history of de Zayas's artistic contributions cannot be separated from his close friendship with Picabia. Each artist was greatly stimulated by the other's conversation and example. Moreover, as William Agee observes, the ex- change between them was "crucial to the embryonic stage of New York Dada" (and thus to Dada in general).5 The immediate occasion of their meeting was the Armory Show of 1913, for which Picabia traveled to America. This revolutionary exposition included four of his paintings, and together with Duchamp - whose contributions were equally scandalous - he soon became the star of the show. During his lengthy stay in New York, Picabia developed close ties to Stieglitz and de Zayas (who spoke fluent French). The day after Picabia's departure, in April, Stieglitz wrote to a friend: Picabia left yesterday. All at "291" will miss him. He and his wife were about the cleanest propositions I ever met in my whole career. They were one hundred percent purity ... Picabia came to "291" virtually daily, and I know he will miss the little place quite as much as we miss him ... I don't know whether you know that an at- tempt is going to be made by him and Mabel Dodge to 1 Jose Pierre, Le Futurisme et la dadaisme, Lausanne, 1967, 69. 2 See William Innes Homer, Alfred Stieglitz and the American Avant- Garde, Boston, 1977, 52. 3 See, e.g., "Marius de Zayas: A Master of Ironical Caricature" (Current Literature, March, 1908, 281-83) which includes quotations from other articles about him and some sample caricatures. 4Catherine Turrill, "Marius de Zayas," Avant-Garde Painting and Sculpture in America 1910-25, ed.

Even Picabia was astonished at de Zayas' ability ...6 Writing in the American Art News two weeks later, an anonymous reviewer confirmed Stieglitz's words and noted: "Picabia says that [de Zayas] is greater than any of the French producers of 'graphical and plastic synthesis of the analysis of individuals,' and Picabia ought to know."'7 This testimony is astonishing. Against all expectations, it reveals the considerable impact of a provincial artist on a cosmopolitan colleague. Picabia's obvious delight with his American friends testifies to the high quality of their ac- complishments. His insistent praise of de Zayas raises the possibility of the latter's influence on his subsequent paintings, although in theory reverse influence is also possible. Indeed, stressing their mutual use of certain geometrical shapes, William A. Camfield concludes that de Zayas was indebted to Picabia.8 What is certain in any case is that each was closely associated with the other, each was working with abstract form, and each was seeking visual equivalents for moods and ideas. Here we note the first of many parallels between de Zayas and Picabia. As if to stress their similarities, Stieglitz decided to pair them on the "291" exhibition calendar: Picabia's show ran from March 17 to April 5, de Zayas's from April 8 to May 20, 1913. In Mexico and during his early years in New York, de Zayas had worked in a realistic, representational style. However much he might distort an individual's features, the final portrait had to be recognizable to be effective. Struggling against the inherent limitations of caricature, de Zayas finally made a significant breakthrough in the period immediately preceding the Armory Show. Adopting invented forms punctuated by mathematical symbols, he developed a totally abstract portraiture that no longer exploited physical appearance. As Agee ob- serves, this "new symbolic-associative language ... was a forerunner both of the Dadaists' formulae and numbers and of Picabia's object-portraits of 1915-1917."9 Until recently nothing was known about the origins of this abstract caricature, nor was it possible to decipher the her metic drawings themselves. Although the scarcity of documentation continues to hamper investigations, a recently published memoir finally provides the key. 1 De Zayas, Al Jolson, ill. in Caroline Caffin, Vaudeville, 1914 2 De Zayas, Ruth St. Denis, ill. in Vaudeville Recalling the genesis of his portrait of Stieglitz (Fig. 3) some years later, de Zayas wrote: ... studying the ethnographical collection at the British Museum, I was impressed by an object invented by an artist from Pukapuka or Danger Island in the Pacific [Fig. 4]. It consisted of a wooden stick to which a few circles made of some vegetal material were fixed by pairs right and left of the stick. It impressed me par- ticularly because it reminded me of the physical ap- pearance of Stieglitz [Fig. 5]. I say "physical" because the resemblance was also spiritual. The object, said the catalogue, was built as a trap for catching souls. The portrait was complete, and it caught my soul, because from it I derived a theory of abstract caricature ... which I exposed together with a few caricatures called "abstract," together with a few others which were of the "concrete" style. ... I had previously made a caricature of Stieglitz with the caption "L'Accoucheur d'id6es." These two caricatures expressed my understanding of Stieglitz' mission: to catch souls and to be the midwife who brings out new ideas to the world.1o 6 Letter from Alfred Stieglitz to Arthur B.

New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art Among other things, this fascinating account of the birth of abstract caricature gives us insight into de Zayas's method and inspiration. Its implications are as exciting as they are far-reaching. It also explains what the artist meant when, in the preface to the exhibition of 1913, he stated: "... my new procedure in caricature is inspired by the psychological reason of the existence of the art of the primitive races, which tried to represent what they thought to be supernatural elements, existing outside of the individual, elements however which science has proved to be natural and which exist within the individual."' 11 Before we proceed to examine the caricatures, however, it is important to establish a chronology for de Zayas's in- vention. If his description stresses the role of immediate inspiration, we will see that the actual outcome stemmed from his familiarity with modern art. If his immediate source was anthropological, the principle itself was un- mistakably artistic. Unfortunately, the reference to L'Accoucheur d'idkes (repro. in Camera Work, July, 1912) is not as helpful as it seems, for although the caricature es- tablishes a sequence, we do not know its date of composi- tion. If anything, its murky symbolism and chiaroscuro effects link it to the caricatures of 1910. Fortunately, we 5 Alfred Stieglitz, Self-Portrait, silver print, 1910. New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 4 Soul-Catcher, Pukapuka (Danger Island). London, British Museum can reconstruct the gestation of the abstract drawings from correspondence preserved in the Alfred Stieglitz Archive at Yale University. This period corresponds to the twelve months that de Zayas spent in Paris between 1910 and 1911. Arriving on October 13, 1910, he immediately plunged into Parisian cultural life, attending the Salon d'Automne repeatedly and mixing with the avant-garde crowd at the Cafe du D6me. At this time de Zayas does not appear to have known much about modern art. In a letter to Stieglitz dated October 29, 1910, he demonstrates a familiarity with Matisse but is baffled by the Cubists, reporting with some astonishment that Metzinger "sees everything geometrically." According to his sources, he adds, Metzinger is only an imitator: "the real article is a Spaniard whose name I don't recall." In a review of the Salon written at this time, de Zayas freely admits his helplessness to understand the Parisian movements and wonders whether Cubism will ever amount to anything.12 By January 25, 1911, however, the situation had changed radically. In the interim de Zayas had met "the real article" (through Frank Burty Haviland, whose brother was one of the directors of "291"), had arranged to show eighty-three of his works at "291," and had ob- tained an interview to be included in the catalogue.

The interview was incor- porated into a preface by de Zayas which was reprinted in Camera Work.13 As this rapid series of events implies, de Zayas was very impressed by Picasso, and the two men quickly became close friends. Under Picasso's tutelage, he gained an excellent knowledge of Cubism and became an ardent convert. De Zayas's interest in African sculpture probably dates from this encounter (in April he suggested an African show to Stieglitz), but it was the exposure to Cubism that had a lasting influence on his own art. Among other things, many of the subsequent caricatures employ geometric forms. More important, however, Cubism introduced him to a new concept of art and paved the way for his experiments with abstraction. If de Zayas devotes part of his preface to specific problems, such as the abolition of perspective and the absence of color, the bulk of the essay is concerned with Cubist theory in general. At the heart of the essay lies the concept of what he calls "the psychology of form," that is, the translation of intellectual and emotional responses into formal pat- terns on the canvas. "Instead of the physical manifesta- tion" of an object or scene, Picasso seeks "the psychic one" in order to represent its "essence." Thus the artist is no longer content to depict mere physical appearance. Ac- cording to de Zayas, "[Picasso] receives a direct impres- sion from external nature, he analyzes, develops, and trans- lates it ... with the intention that the picture should be the pictorial equivalent of the emotion produced by nature. In representing his work he wants the spectator to look for the emotion or idea generated from the spectacle and not the spectacle itself" (emphasis added). As we will see, the concept of essence versus appearance underlies the inven- tion of abstract caricature. Equally important is Picasso's theory of pictorial equivalence - from which de Zayas derived his own abstract method. Notwithstanding their obvious stylistic differences, the two men shared a com- mon psychology of form. Nowhere is de Zayas's debt to the Spanish artist more evident than in the preface to his 1913 exhibition where he defines abstract caricature as: "the representation of feelings and ideas through material equivalents."'14 Written earlier, de Zayas's article on Picasso was not ac- tually forwarded to Stieglitz until March 7, 1911. In the accompanying letter, de Zayas remarks: "I have started on a new idea and made some caricatures and drawings for the philosophical collection." In light of the preface on Picasso, the announcement of a new style is intriguing. From what we have just seen, it undoubtedly reflected the influence of Cubism, but to what extent and toward what end is impossible to say. To be sure, the term "philosophical" implies a superior, more abstruse form of art. This probably does not mark the birth of abstract caricature, however, for there is no evidence of the crucial trip to England described by de Zayas in his recently published memoir. Still, he appears to have developed considerably since meeting Picasso, and he was undoubt- edly headed toward abstraction. Following a visit by Stieglitz in September, lasting some three weeks, de Zayas prepared to return to the United States. The correspon- dence breaks off after August 26, with one important ex- ception - a telegram. Containing an urgent request for $150, which de Zayas says he will repay when he arrives in New York, it bears the dateline "London, October 18, 1911." Not only does this allow us to fix the date of his return, in early November, it provides the only evidence we have of a trip to London. It was doubtless at this time, pursuing the interest in primitive art he had developed in Paris, that de Zayas encountered the catalytic "soul- catcher" in the British Museum. This impression is strengthened by two separate bits of information. For one thing, Stieglitz wrote to Sadakichi Hartmann on Decem- ber 22, 1911: "De Zayas has developed most remarkably and is a big fellow."15 Coming from the leader of "291," this is high praise and suggests a recent breakthrough. For another, external evidence alone seems to limit the British Museum episode to October, 1911. After this date, de Zayas did not venture abroad again until 1914. Before this date, as far as can be determined, his caricatures are all realistic. Admittedly, we have only a portion of his works, but the surviving photographs and descriptions reveal a general pattern. According to the catalogue of de Zayas's 1913 show, en- titled "Caricature: Abstract and Relative," the following works were on exhibition: 1. Alfred Stieglitz 2. Gaby Deslys 3. Arthur Hoeber 4. Agnes Ernst Meyer 5. Picabia 6. Two Friends 7. Paul Haviland 8. A New York Society Leader 9. Theodore Roosevelt 10. Regina Badet 11. Regina Badet 12. Rodin and Steichen 13. Marin and Stieglitz 14.

The abstract portraits depict Stieglitz, Meyer, Two Friends, Roosevelt, Paul Haviland, and Picabia. An additional realistic caricature of Dr. A. A. Berg, whom de Zayas met in 1912 when he was hospitalized for an un- known illness (date of release: September 14), may or may not have been included in the exhibition.17 From a review by William B. McCormick, writing in the New York Press, we know that the portraits of Regina Badet and of Picasso and Frank Haviland were realistic, while those of Arthur Hoeber (art critic for the New York Globe), A New York Society Leader, and Gaby Deslys were abstract.18 Among other things, this means that the exhibition was evenly divided between de Zayas's new (Nos. 1-9) and old (Nos. 10-18) styles. Wishing to give a faithful impression of his activities since his last show, in 1910, de Zayas included seven works from his Paris period. Besides the Rodin/Steichen and the Picasso/Haviland portraits, which could only have been done in France, there are five caricatures of Parisian actors and entertainers. In 1911, for example, Regina Badet was featured in La Femme et le pantin, directed by Firmin G~mier, which de Zayas would have seen at the Thbitre Antoine. Similarly, Blanche Albane starred in L'Homme mystkrieux at the Thbitre Sarah-Bernhardt during the 1910-11 season. Polaire, of course, was a famous cabaret singer in Montmartre, and Jean Mounet-Sully was the chief attraction at the Com~die Fran;aise. Celebrated for his passionate portrayal of Vic- tor Hugo's Hernani, in the play by the same name, Mounet-Sully played this role for the last time in 1911, when he gave ten performances.19 From this brief survey, it appears that the Paris caricatures were all realistic. Matching titles with photographs and descriptions, we note that de Zayas con- tinued to work in this mode when he returned to America, even as he was experimenting with abstract caricature. Thus the realistic drawings of Charles Darnton and of Marin and Stieglitz were both done after his return, as a detailed chronology would show. To th'ese must be added countless works that appeared in commercial publications between 1912 and 1915. In 1912, at the request of the prominent New York producer George C. Tyler, de Zayas created a successful pantomime which he described as "theater of caricature."20 In 1914 he collaborated on a book about vaudeville, contributing some thirty sketches of famous performers (Figs. 1, 2).21 From this, we may conclude that there was no sudden shift between de Zayas's old and new styles, as critics have assumed, for the two continued to exist side by side. Nor is there any evidence that the second style was born in 1913, another frequent assumption. The most that can be said is that it was first made public in 1913. Of the nine abstract por- traits in the "291" exhibition, only two can be dated with any degree of certainty: Francis Picabia and Gaby Deslys. The first dates from Picabia's visit to New York (January 20-April 10, 1913), and the second seems to have been ex- ecuted about the same time. In theory, the abstract portrait of Gaby Deslys, a French vaudeville artist, could have been done in Paris, but she was also a well-known figure on the American stage. According to the New York Times Index, for example, she starred in the Review of Re- views at the Winter Garden from September 17, 1911, to January 29, 1912, returning for another engagement on November 11, 1912.22 Furthermore, we know that de Zayas attended at least one performance during her second tour, for a (realistic) caricature of her as Yvonne in The Honeymoon Express appeared in the New York Evening World on February 7, 1913. Two months later he published five more caricatures of her in the same paper (April 12, 1913). If these two portraits were executed with the upcoming exhibition in mind, the dates of the others are open to conjecture. Theodore Roosevelt, for example, may have been done in response to the ex-President's con- descending review of the Armory Show in March, 1913.23 But since de Zayas had been lampooning him for years in the Evening World, an earlier date is equally possible. In any event, while European influence is easily discernible in the abstract portraits, the drawings themselves were done in the United States. Depicting New Yorkers or visitors to New York, they form a distinct group whose American setting contrasts with the French locale of the earlier works. Stylistically and thematically, each group balances the other. Following his exhibition at "291," de Zayas returned to 16 Camera Work, XLVI, April, 1914, pls. I-III and v-x.

A dancer, singer, and actress, Gaby Deslys specialized in musical satires. 23 Theodore Roosevelt, "A Layman's Views of an Art Exhibition," The Outlook, March 29, 1913, 718-20, repr. in 1913 Armory Show 50th An- niversary Exhibition, exh. cat., Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute and Henry Street Settlement, Utica, 1963, 160-62.</page><page sequence="6">THE ABSTRACT VISION OF MARIUS DE ZAYAS 439 France in 1914 where he spent the summer on assignment for Stieglitz. Arriving on May 13, he did not return to the United States until September 12.24 In Paris de Zayas quickly renewed his friendship with Picabia, who in- troduced him to Guillaume Apollinaire and the group cen- tered around Les Soirees de Paris. Before long he and Apollinaire had become good friends and were even collaborating on a Dadaist play, together with Picabia and Alberto Savinio.25 Interestingly, Apollinaire's reaction to the abstract caricatures was the same as Picabia's the year before. Writing in Paris-Journal on July 8, he noted with enthusiasm: ... Until now, today's art, which is so expressive, had produced only one real caricaturist: Jossot, an unjustly forgotten artist. Now, however, we have another caricaturist. His name is Marius de Zayas, and his caricatures, employ- ing some very new techniques, are in accord with the art of the most audacious contemporary painters. I recently had a chance to see some of these new caricatures. They are incredibly powerful, especially those of Ambroise Vollard, Bergson, and Henri Matisse. The next Salon of Humorists should set aside a room for the works of Marius de Zayas. They are well worth the trouble.26 One week later Apollinaire published four caricatures in the July-August issue of Les Soirees de Paris. Besides the portraits of Stieglitz and Picabia exhibited at "291," de Zayas contributed drawings of Vollard and Apollinaire.27 Although he was to experiment with visual poetry the following year, de Zayas seems to have published only two more caricatures before abandoning this form. Ap- pearing in the December, 1915, issue of 291, the last exam- ple was devoted to Picasso - who resembles Ferdinand the Bull (Fig. 6). In this drawing, black represents mass and white represents space. At the center, seen in profile fac- ing right, a triangular, horned figure gazes into the dis- tance with beady eyes. The upper half of the drawing is dominated by a heavy structure resembling a canopy, which is balanced by the horned figure and by a rec- tangular form at the lower right. Judging from the con- junction of the various forms, the figure (Picasso) seems to be seated before a desk or a table. To the left, behind this squat but powerful character, a rose pushes forth into the surrounding space - itself shaped like an arrowhead to in- dicate motion and direction. This strong diagonal, con- tinued by other structures, adds a dynamic note to the otherwise static drawing. De Zayas has clearly created a 6 De Zayas, Pablo Picasso, from 291, December, 1915-January, 1916 dialogue between beauty and power here, a dialogue which he sees as central to Picasso's art. At one level, the horned figure and the rose refer to Picasso's Spanish origins, symbolized by the bullfight. At another level, they juxtapose the delicate sensibility of his Rose Period with the brutality of his Cubist phase. To understand de Zayas's drawings fully, however, we must go back to 1913 and the preface to his exhibition catalogue (see footnotes 11 and 14), in which he discusses his theory of abstract caricature. In spite of a certain awkwardness of expression (de Zayas was more at ease in Spanish or French than in English), the main points of his aesthetic are clear. Instead of depicting the physical appearance of an individual - a superficial process at best - de Zayas proposes to provide an "analysis." Art is no longer to be rendered as extrinsic impression but as "in- trinsic expression." In this context, he outlines his method as follows: 24 Letters from Marius de Zayas to Alfred Stieglitz, May 22, 1914, and from Marie Rapp to Alfred Stieglitz, September 14, 1914.

LeRoy C. Breunig, New York, 1972, 419. 27 Writing to the poetess Jeanne-Yves Blanc from the front on October 18, 1915, Apollinaire offered the following commentary: "As for the drawing by de Zayas intitled Guillaume Apollinaire, the review's cover explains that it is a caricature. The word 'table' does not resemble a table in any fashion, and yet it manages to suggest the idea of a table. Are you beginning to grasp the essence of this caricature ...?"

Michel DCcaudin, Paris, 1966-67, Iv, 675).</page><page sequence="7">440 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1980 VOLUME LXII NUMBER 3 (1) the spirit of the individual is to be represented by algebraic formulas, (2) his material self by "geometrical equivalents," and (3) his initial force by "trajectories within the rectangle that encloses the plastic expression and represents life." According to de Zayas, the spirit is composed of (a) "Memory (acquired knowledge), (b) Understanding (capability of learning, intelligence), and (c) Volition (the regulator of physical desires, vices, and virtues)." By "material self" he means the human body. Finally, he defines "initial force," which recalls Bergson's concept of alan vital, as that which "binds spirit and matter together." In the caricatures it is represented by a line or "trajectory" symbolizing the individual's passage through life, the quality of which is the product of his spiritual and material capabilities. Though de Zayas does not say so, this device is taken from analytical geometry. If X = spirit and Y = material self, then the equation X+Y = a numerical quantity may be represented on a graph as a curve described by the variables X and Y. This is why he calls his art a "graphical and plastic synthesis." From this it would seem that a rising curve indicates prosperity and success, a falling curve the opposite. A typical life might thus be diagrammed as a bell-shaped curve starting from zero. Although one's spiritual capabilities steadily increase from birth, one's physical capabilities decline after a cer- tain age. The point at which the descending curve inter- sects the X axis would correspond to the individual's death (Y = 0). De Zayas distinguishes five classes of trajectories based on the Positivistic sequence: knowledge-*progress--con- clusion. Although these categories are meant to relate a person's life to the general "evolution of humanity," they are not judgmental so much as descriptive. De Zayas provides the following summary: (1) No beginning or end - individuals who have tacit knowledge, who contribute to progress in general, but who do not arrive at a conclusion. (2) An end but no beginning - same as above but with a definite conclusion. (3) A beginning but no end - acquisition of knowledge and contribution to progress without a conclusion. (4) A beginning and an end - acquisition of knowledge, contribution to progress, and a conclusion. (5) Inert or static individuals who do not move with the general progress. These have no trajectories whatsoever. From this outline it is easy to see why Stieglitz, Picabia, and Apollinaire were so impressed with the abstract caricatures. Aside from de Zayas's technical mastery, his system is both sensitive and complex. In spite of its ob- vious scientific bias, it offers considerable leeway for ar- tistic interpretation and expression. In trying to express his "feelings and ideas through material equivalents," de Zayas was aiming primarily at a "psychological represen- tation" of his subject. Paul B. Haviland, who preferred the spelling characature, defined this goal as the "representa- tion of character through form."28 In actuality, de Zayas's ambition extended even further. Elsewhere in his article- preface he defines caricature as "the representation of the individual self and his relation to the whole"- a rather large order. In this light, the best assessment of his draw- ings was offered by Picabia who described them as "the psychological expression of man's plurality."29 Despite the startling originality of this system, de Zayas is heavily indebted to two schools of thought: Positivism and Cubism. His interest in the latter dates from 1910/11, as we have seen, whereas the former seems to have cap- tivated him at an early age. From 1911 (the date of his first article) to 1913 and beyond, these constitute the twin themes of his writings, which seek to apply the scientific method to modern aesthetics. Totally committed to the Positivist philosophy, de Zayas remarks in one place: "I believe in progress as a constant and ineludible law." Elsewhere he describes himself as a "cause-and-effect speculator ... for whom ... all things ... must be computed and accounted for."30 An ardent admirer of Claude Ber- nard's Introduction s l'btude de la mbdecine expirimentale (1865), a cornerstone of scientific methodology, de Zayas adopts a similar approach in his 1913 preface. Envisaging a new mathematical humanism in the second paragraph, he claims to be able to "represent psychological and metaphysical entities by algebraic signs and solve their problems through mathematics." As noted, de Zayas's search for pictorial equivalents of ideas and emotions derives directly from Picasso. While there are numerous differences in their two styles, not to mention the treatment of objects, they share similar theories of abstraction. Great as his admiration was for Picasso, however, de Zayas was troubled by one aspect of his work, which he interpreted as a shortcoming. Moreover, since Picasso personified modern art in general for him, until 1913, this defect had broad repercussions. As late as January, 1913, de Zayas noted: "Picasso is perhaps the only artist who in our time works in search of a new form. But Picasso is only an analyst; up to the pres- ent his productions reveal solely the plastic analysis of ar- 28 Paul B.

This is why he speaks of "a graphical and plastic synthesis" in the preface. More than anything, the drawings are charac- terized by a synthetic approach to their subjects. If the ar- tist divides his subject into three separate components, his ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive picture of the total person. Viewing his subject from every possible perspective - subjective, objective, and societal- he in ef- fect achieves synthesis through multiple analysis. Although de Zayas appears to have been unaware of re- cent developments in Paris, this process parallels the achievements of Synthetic Cubism since his last visit. In both, for various parts are subordinated to the whole to produce an essential unity of vision. Turning to the caricatures themselves (Figs. 3-15), we note a certain amount of technical variation over the years. According to Camera Work, the drawings in the show of 1913 were done in charcoal, but the rest are in pen and ink - except Picasso where the artist reverted to charcoal. Curiously, when de Zayas reprinted his caricatures of Stieglitz and Picabia in Les Soirees de Paris, he made new pen and ink copies. These are remarkably faithful to the originals but contain several (minor) variations. In a second portrait of Stieglitz (Fig. 15), published in 1915, the main lines are accented with red watercolor, lending an unexpected dynamism to the composition. Although the dimensions of the later drawings are unknown, they ap- pear to approximate the 25 X 20" format of the works ex- hibited in 1913.32 In composition round forms predominate, but angular shapes are numerous and strong. The compositions are often arranged sym- metrically around a vertical axis, and several include prominent diagonals. Black (mass) and white (space) occur in equal amounts, reflecting de Zayas's dichotomy be- tween the spirit and the material self. In general, the caricatures' two-dimensionality emphasizes their schematic function, and the lack of perspective, like the absence of color and the geometric forms, is clearly Cubist-inspired. The only evidence of volume is in Francis Picabia (Fig. 7) where it is not immediately recognizable. Here, just below the lowest "eye," the vertical edge inter- sects three parallel contours, suggesting a cylindrical ob- ject seen in cross-section. De Zayas's algebraic depiction of the spirit is both in- triguing and frustrating. Although alegbra permits a com- pletely abstract symbolism, there is no evidence that he knew enough about mathematics to take advantage of it. Nevertheless, given his systematic, highly theoretical mind, we can scarcely doubt the existence of a complex system here. Unfortunately, in the absence of any ex- planation by the artist, it remains resolutely personal and hermetic. The absence of algebraic devices in three of the later drawings seems to indicate that the system was even- tually discontinued. For the present it suffices to note that only one of the drawings (Theodore Roosevelt, Fig. 8) contains a true equation. In all the others the equals sign must be inferred, e.g., Figure 3. Stieglitz = a--b3 c2+-d2 + f- e2 h2 With two exceptions (Haviland and Picabia), every equa- tion contains at least four variables. Three drawings have six or more. This means that the formulae cannot describe any of the graphic curves, since the X/Y grid can only ac- commodate two variables. It also leaves us wondering how to reconcile the equations with de Zayas's description of the human spirit. If we assign a letter to each spiritual category (Memory, Understanding, and Volition), there are not enough. If we include the six subcategories, there are too many. The spiritual significance of the square root sign is also puzzling: probably it serves to separate one group of letters from the other. This does not alter the probability that the artist assigned a different personal value to each letter. Those preceding the square root sign (never more than three) may represent general categories, whereas the sign itself may denote a more detailed analysis. Or again the capital letters may designate major categories and the lower-case letters lesser ones. In any event, a minus sign probably indicates a lack of that par- ticular quality, just as a "-" signifies the instability of a given trait. It is also reasonable to assume that the dif- ferent powers correspond to different degrees of intensity, extending from average to above average to exceptional. Thus, despite the impression of mathematical chaos, there is a certain correlation between the complexity of an in- dividual and his algebraic expression. With eight variables, four of which are cubed, the equation for Stieglitz (Fig. 3) is the most complex, followed by those for Agnes Ernst Meyer and Haviland (both collaborators at "291"). This corresponds to what we know of Steiglitz at least, who was quite a complicated person. At the other end of the scale are Picabia and Teddy Roosevelt (Figs. 7 and 8), a rather unlikely pair. In Picabia's case, the bare notation "a+b+c / a+b / B" does not denote a mediocre spirit, but rather an inherent simplicity of spirit. One of Picabia's most invigorating qualities was the childlike sim- plicity of his art and life. Both domains were governed by the principle of instant gratification (whim, fantasy, etc.), 31 "Photography," 17. 32 Camera Work, XLVI, April, 1914, 51.

The capital B may emphasize his remarkable in- telligence (Understanding) - also one of his more salient characteristics. In Roosevelt's case, the lack of complexity is clearly derogatory. Described by a contemporary critic as "a sort of electric wired beartrap" with "shark teeth," this draw- ing is summarized by the equation" = O." As the same critic notes, what de Zayas meant to write was " = 0" ( = co, not 0). In either case, his meaning is un- mistakable: juxtaposed with the immensity of the uni- verse, the self-important Roosevelt is totally insignificant. From a spiritual perspective, he is a nonentity, a big fat zero. As noted, the immediate source of de Zayas's outrage was possibly Roosevelt's article on the Armory Show, which combined philistinism with smugness. It is in- teresting that this is the only caricature lacking a trajectory line. Roosevelt is clearly an "inert" or "static" individual who has not contributed to real human progress. This im- pression is reinforced by his physical appearance, for he is mainly a mouth. A bulbous nose surmounts a wide-open mouth seen through a screen of zigzag lines. Anchored to the equation and extending in two directions, these lines represent his prominent moustache. The pattern at the top of the drawing repeats the vertical zigzag motif, resem- bling "a backgammon board or a row of dunce's caps" ac- cording to one critic.35 Although the last suggestion has interesting possibilities, the white triangles probably represent Roosevelt's teeth. Displaced, flattened, and jux- taposed according to Cubist practice, they are partially screened by the black triangles of his moustache which parts to reveal a flashing smile (a Roosevelt trademark). All in all, the portrait is quite humorous. With the exception of Theodore Roosevelt, de Zayas's published abstract caricatures depict people he knew and admired. And since they were all successful avant-garde artists or critics, their portraits resemble each other in some respects. This is noticeable in the trajectories chosen SCf.

Although these are occasionally difficult to identify (e.g., Paul B. Haviland, Fig. 12), their meanings are mostly self-evident. They should not be confused with the vertical axis in many of the drawings which serves another function. Es- pecially prominent in the Stieglitz, Meyer, and Haviland portraits, this device contributes to their general symmetry and introduces a note of stability. If these persons are more complex than their companions, as we have seen, they are also much more organized. In most instances, the trajectory itself sweeps through the portrait in a graceful curve, intersecting the frame (symbolizing life) initially and terminally. Since even the exceptions observe the rule of double intersection, these are all drawings of the fourth class of trajectory (having a beginning, middle, and end). Their subjects are all clearly achievers who have used their knowledge and skills to contribute to progress. Stieglitz (Fig. 3) seems to have done this in two stages, for his tra- jectory contains the subtypes 3 and 2. De Zayas may be thinking here of his contribution via photography and "291". A similar pattern exists for the anonymous Two Friends (Fig. 9) who have achieved more together than either has separately. Finally, with one exception, the tra- jectories all follow rising curves, indicating prosperity and success. Either they arch toward the upper right corner like a bell curve, or they reverse this process, rising from right to left. Although we know that each trajectory has its CI~ ??'I \' J)L CL I /L 10 De Zayas, Ambroise Vollard, from Les Soiries de Paris, July- August, 1914 own directional symbolism, the difference between a left- and a right-hand curve is not clear. The situation is com- plicated, moreover, by the evidence of the first Stieglitz portrait and Two Friends which combine these forms in two different fashions. This leaves the drawing of Am- broise Vollard (Fig. 10) whose falling curve indicates that de Zayas thought he was on the decline. In fact, although Vollard had been the dealer for Cezanne and his contem- poraries, his prestige was being usurped by Daniel Kahnweiler who represented the Cubists. Interesting as these details are, they are largely overshadowed by de Zayas's theory of geometric equivalents. Although most of the drawings are highly resistant to interpretation, his experience with the Polyne- sian soul-catcher, described earlier, indicates the nature of their underlying inspiration. It also explains why de Zayas's visual symbolism is difficult to decipher. Ac- cording to the method revealed to him at the British Museum, each of his subjects undergoes a process of double abstraction. In practice this involves two steps: ob- jectification and simplification. Once an object is chosen to represent a given person, its basic form is abstracted to produce a portrait twice removed from reality. In addition, the choice of the object depends on a double correspon- dence between subject and object. The resemblance must be physical as well as "spiritual" (symbolic). The latter concept involves a search for functional equivalents in</page><page sequence="11">444 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1980 VOLUME LXII NUMBER 3 which the role of the object serves as a metaphor for the role of the subject (Stieglitz the soul-catcher). Although these intermediate objects are often impossible to identify, de Zayas makes it perfectly clear that objectification is at work in every instance. Theodore Roosevelt, for example, seems to have been constructed around the image of a common scrub brush - his moustache - perhaps sym- bolizing the ex-President's abrasiveness, his tendency to rub people the wrong way. Thus in any caricature we can expect to find (1) visual reference to physical appearance, (2) visual symbolism, and (3) a certain amount of aesthetic adjustment (simplification, displacement, repetition, etc.). Interestingly, de Zayas made no attempt to standardize these ingredients, which vary in degree and proportion. Except for a pair of eyes, Two Friends (Fig. 9) contains no overt reference at all to subject or object. On the other hand, the portraits of Vollard and Apollinaire (Figs. 10 and 13) are fairly representational, and aesthetic distortion is kept to a minimum. Returning to the very first abstract caricature (Alfred Stieglitz, Fig. 3), the source of all the others, we note that it represents a significant advance over previous efforts. The earlier drawing L'Accoucheur d'id es, which juxtaposes a frontal, full-length view of Stieglitz with the halo of a full moon, is entirely realistic. Despite the symbolism of the ti- tle (and the moon), the drawing is essentially allegorical and thus belongs to an established genre. If de Zayas com- bines an objective portrait and a metaphoric title in this work, he reverses the process in the abstract version. Here we find a metaphoric portrait (the soul-catcher) coupled with an objective title: Alfred Stieglitz. In transferring his symbolism from the verbal to the visual plane, the artist gave it a central position in his aesthetic. Formerly relegated to the status of an afterthought, tacked on at the last minute, the symbol became the raison d'etre of the en- tire work. In this particular instance, the image is un- usually apt. Not only does the soul-catcher symbolize Stieglitz's role as chief proselytizer for modernism in America, it also symbolizes his efforts as a photographer, whose task is to capture human images on film. De Zayas was undoubtedly thinking of the common primitive belief that a camera imprisons a person's soul. Because the original soul-catcher (Fig. 4) was geometrical, artistic alterations of it were minimal in the caricature. De Zayas eliminated one pair of loops in the interest of symmetry, blackened the central pair for the same reason, and con- fined the configuration to a single plane. He then added the small, textured triangle at the lower left to evoke Stieglitz's physical appearance, which was dominated by his glasses and triangular moustache (Fig. 5). The eyeglass motif is repeated above and below, to the right and to the left of the central pair of circles, stressing Stieglitz's all- encompassing vision. Alone of all the caricatures, this has forms that extend past the frame, which symbolizes life, and into the great Beyond. In this context, as Craig R. Bailey notes, the eyeglasses may be seen as infinity signs. A higher tribute to the leader of "291" would be hard to imagine.36 Although traces of physical characteristics may be seen in most, if not all, of the other caricatures, their symbolic objects are often obscured. Thus Agnes Ernst Meyer's beauty is suggested by the long, flowing lines of her hair, a breast or two, and her eyes (Fig. 11), but her objective symbolism escapes us. If the object in the portrait looks suspiciously like an airplane soaring through the air, its upward course indicated by the same curves that represent her hair, this identification is far from certain. The portrait of Paul B. Haviland (Fig. 12) is even more hermetic. The twin forms at the bottom, which recall Duchamp's malic molds, are totally unfamiliar but may depict the halves of a teacup. We know that Haviland was the American representative for Haviland china, manufactured in Limoges, France. From the standpoint of physical ap- pearance, there is little doubt that the cup handles are meant to be his ears - easily his most prominent feature - which stood out at right angles from his head.37 Similarly the two halves of the cup, squeezing a fleshy object be- tween them, probably represent the high, stiff collar that Haviland liked to wear. The key to interpreting the image in the middle lies in the series of parallel, M-shaped curves that give it the appearance of a fountain. Although they could represent Haviland's eyes, wrinkled forehead, or hairline (or a combination of these), they almost certainly refer to his favorite hairstyle. Certainly his second-most prominent feature was his hair, which he parted in the middle like H. L. Mencken. In keeping with the Cubist strategy of displacement (e.g., the ears) and repetition, de Zayas abstracts and repeats this characteristic frontal silhouette. In like manner, the fun-loving Picabia is represented by three smiling eyes and the rounded contours of his head (Fig. 7). Otherwise the portrait is impenetrable. The sharp corners and clean edges suggest a machine part of some sort, possibly connected with his passion for automobiles. Vaguely resembling a traffic light, the object has some of the characteristics of a (bisected) piston, seen from above. We can increase the resemblance by generating the other half according to the rules of symmetry, completing the circles (rings), and combining the black cut-outs to form a single semicircle in the center (the shaft). Unfortunately, 36 De Zayas gave the original drawing to Stieglitz, who later gave it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A slightly smaller pencil and gouache ver- sion (18 X 14") is owned by the Mus&amp;e de Peinture et de Sculpture in Grenoble, where it is incorrectly attributed to Picabia. Except for an in- scription in the lower left corner reading "PICABIA" - probably a dedication - the portrait is identical to the version in the Metropolitan Museum. It is reproduced in the Gazette des beaux-arts, Suppl., CLXIII, February, 1973. 37 See, e.g., Homer, 51.</page><page sequence="12">THE ABSTRACT VISION OF MARIUS DE ZAYAS 445 ?" ,, ?..??~~: i?. rc~h ..??

Haviland, from Camera Work, April, 1914 we have no way of knowing if this is the correct inter- pretation. The intermediate object in Ambroise Vollard's portrait (Fig. 10) is even more elusive. In terms of physical appearance the dealer is reduced to a pair of glasses and a pointed beard, but the role of objectification here is un- clear. Fortunately, the drawing of Apollinaire (Fig. 13) is more accessible. Physically, the poet's bulk, his prominent eyes and eyebrows, and the smooth contour of his head are emphasized (cf. Fig. 14). Literally and figuratively, he looms large over the picture, his immense body crammed into the available space and overflowing the frame. If Apollinaire's physical presence is translated into heavy volumes, it is likewise evident in the bold strokes that slash through the work. Thus despite his great size, his liveliness and love of adventure can be sensed. As in the portrait of Picabia, the sharp corners and clean edges suggest a mechanical object. While the caricature of Agnes Ernst Meyer is fraught with am- biguity, no such problem exists here: there is little doubt that Apollinaire is represented as an airplane. For one thing, we can easily make out both wings of a biplane, ex- tending from lower left to upper right, and connected by seven lines representing guy-wires. For another, Apollinaire's head is shaped exactly like the motor (without propeller). Moreover, the two quotation-mark curves in the center probably delineate the cowl, just as the gigantic curve above his head indicates his flight path. In any case, the analogy between the soaring flight of the machine and that of the poet is unmistakable. Both sym- bolize the victory of mind over matter and glorify inven- tion. The airplane is also the central image of Apollinaire's best-known poem, "Zone" (1912), which de Zayas is un- doubtedly alluding to here. If Apollinaire's portrait is easily the most dynamic of the series, it is rivaled by the 1915 caricature of Stieglitz as "291" (Fig. 15). Appearing on the cover of the first issue of 291 (March, 1915) with the legend "291 throws back its forelock," the drawing illustrates this gesture with broad diagonal strokes. As such it announces the ambitious ex- perimentalism of this avant-garde publication and places Stieglitz at its head. The idea itself was suggested by a previous anthropomorphic description of "291" by Picabia, beginning "291 arranges the locks on its forehead - but the flames cannot scorch it, and its soul is full of life ..."38 Like the earlier version, the Stieglitz portrait features the well-known glasses and moustache. It is less abstract, however, than its counterpart (Fig. 5), and the algebraic equation has been replaced by a printed phrase. This time the key lies in the vigorous upward motion of the lines. The strong diagonals indicate that the small mass 38 "Que fais-tu 2917," Camera Work, XLVII, July, 1914, 72.</page><page sequence="13">446 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1980 VOLUME LXII NUMBER 3 13 De Zayas, Guillaume Apollinaire, from Les Soirees de Paris, July-August, 1914 i i : 9 ,, t t? r r b 14 Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913. Paris, private collection at the top (Stieglitz's head) has just popped out of the heavy, rectangular mass at the bottom. Since a jack-in- the-box is probably too irreverent an image for de Zayas's mentor, the inevitable conclusion is that a camera with extended bellows represents Stieglitz. Either object would be an apt choice. In portraying Stieglitz as a master of sur- prise, the artist would be stressing the avant-garde role of "291." In objectifying him as a camera, de Zayas would be focusing on his reputation as a photographer. "Stieglitz comprises the history of photography in the United States," he wrote a few months later, and in 1915 this was true.39 The former interpretation emphasizes Stieglitz's function as an innovator, the latter stresses his function as the eye of the avant-garde. From midwife to soul-catcher to camera or jack-in-the-box, there is a constant emphasis on revelation and personal vision. The subsequent influence of de Zayas's abstract caricature is as interesting as its creation. Listed for years as an "antecedent" of Picabia's mechanomorphic style, it occupied an ambiguous position with respect to the latter's development. With the discovery of the Polynesian soul- catcher, however, we can no longer ignore the importance of de Zayas's contribution to modern art. It is now clear that Picabia's machine drawings derive in large part from the abstract caricatures. Not only are they deliberately modeled on the caricatures, they embody the same theory of the object. Although the long list of European precur- sors cited by Camfield, a leading authority, establishes a historical context for this development, most of their in- fluence seems to have been peripheral.40 The date and place of Picabia's discovery make this conclusion in- escapable, for as Camfield has also demonstrated, his mechanomorphic style began in New York in the summer of 1915.4' Although the content and aesthetic preoccupa- tions of his paintings remained much the same, the shift in style was radical. There is very little in Picabia's background to prepare us for this development. Arriving in New York in June, he threw himself into "291" ac- tivities with renewed vigor.42 Immediately contributing a drawing to 291, edited by de Zayas, Picabia collaborated on four of the remaining five issues. The mechanomorphic style itself does not appear until July, with the publication of five object-portraits in 291 (Figs. 16-20).43 The sensa- tion of d jz vu is overwhelming.

For all practical purposes, the subjects of Picabia's 291 series are the same as those of de Zayas's Camera Work caricatures. In both cases, the drawings depict editors and collaborators on the two magazines headed by Stieglitz, whose portrait naturally comes first. Moreover, Picabia's drawing of Stieglitz (Fig. 16) seems to be modeled on de Zayas's 1915 portrait of Stieglitz. Both works appear on the cover of 291, both make Stieglitz the personification of "291," and both portray him as a camera. They even use the same pose: a side view of the camera lying flat on its back with its bellows extended upward. Already familiar with his abstract caricature from con- versations with de Zayas in 1913 and 1914, Picabia was finally stimulated to experiment with it by developments in his own art. Whereas previously he had been preoc- cupied by his experiments with total abstraction, which reached their zenith during 1913-14, by 1915 he had tired of this form and was looking for new inspiration. Doubt- less the war played a role too, upsetting his life and creating a need for a stronger mode of expression. Picabia specifically acknowledged his search for a new art form in an interview published in October, 1915. Speaking of his mechanomorphic drawings, he declared: "In seeking forms through which to interpret ideas or by which to ex- pose human characteristics, I have come at length upon the form which appears most brilliantly plastic and fraught with symbolism. I have enlisted the machinery of the modern world and introduced it into my studio."44 Although there is no mention of de Zayas here, Picabia's interest in "ideas" and "human characteristics" is identical to his friend's "representation of feelings and ideas through material equivalents." For each, portraiture is a psychological genre, focusing not so much on the artist's subject as on his reaction to his subject. Paradoxically, this response is expressed objectively. Both men create subjec- tive portraits utilizing objective means - a reversal of the traditional artistic process. Whereas Duchamp's Readymades begin with the object (and often go no further), Picabia and de Zayas take the individual as their starting point. Whereas the Futurists seek to glorify the machine, Picabia and de Zayas are interested only in its symbolism. Machines are merely the means to an end, not the end itself. At the heart of their joint aesthetic lies the theory of correspondance. Psychological representation depends on a system of abstract pictorial equivalents. The fact that various objects may be identified in the drawings does not make them any less abstract. Although Picabia's "', 191 JI ! rC 2*1 ..... j- 15 De Zayas, 291 Throws Back Its Forelock, from 291, March, 1915 forms are easily recognizable, his works are not much easier to decipher than de Zayas's caricatures. Both artists use a highly personal symbolism in which humor plays an important part. The most obvious example of Picabia's humor lies in his use of functional analogy - which powers the object- portraits just as it does the abstract caricatures. Here, as throughout his oeuvre, his comments are inclined to be mischievous, even mocking. If all five portraits present their subjects in a humorous light, some are more acerbic than others. This is the case with the depictions of Stieglitz and Haviland, whose portraits have been analyzed by Camfield and Homer. Stieglitz is portrayed as a broken camera, a gearshift in neutral, and a handbrake that is still set (Fig. 16). As a lamp Haviland may be a source of light, but someone has cut off his plug (Fig. 18).45 Picabia gets "' Anon., "French Artists Spur On American Art," New York Tribune, October 24, 1915, t. Iv, 2. Cited in Camfield, 77. 45 Given the satirical bent of the other portraits, this is surely not acciden- tal. The precise reference is hard to pinpoint, but Haviland is clearly cut off from an important source of energy. Although the absence of love, motivation, or even money are all possibilities, Picabia is probably alluding to his imminent departure for Europe (he sailed soon after). Without the stimulus of "291," which we know he treasured, Haviland would be deprived of his greatest source of vitality. The fact that the lainp is portable reinforces this interpretation. The inscription "La po~sie est comme lui" ("Poetry is like him") may be interpreted to mean that neither poetry nor Haviland can flourish without vital energy. Ultimately the portrait is flattering since it stresses Haviland's poetic soul.</page><page sequence="15">448 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1980 VOLUME LXII NUMBER 3 ?E21? ICI.

The portrait of de Zayas (Fig. 20) is actually quite funny. Modifying a schematic diagram of an automobile's electrical system, Picabia depicts de Zayas as an automatic seducing machine. In- serting a coin in the slot at the top will start his engine which, in turn, will energize his headlights (at the bottom) and the sexual parts of the woman at the upper left (sym- bolized by a corset). The line connecting the tire valve (valve de pneu in French) at the upper right to the woman's nipple emphasizes the pneumatic bliss that awaits him. The comment "J'ai vu et c'est de toi qu'il s'agit" might best be translated as "I've seen you in action, and this is certainly you!" Picabia is obviously satirizing de Zayas's reputation as a lady-killer. Below, the exclama- tion "De Zayas! De Zayas!" is followed by the phrase "Je suis venu sur les rivages du Pont-Euxin" ("I have come to the shores of the Black Sea").

The allusion is not to Ovid, as William Homer suggests, but to Xenophon's Anabasis (Iv.8.24).46 Glimps- ing the shores of the Black Sea after their long, arduous retreat from Persia, Xenophon's soldiers burst into cries of "Thalassa! Thalassa!" ("The Sea! The Sea!"). For them the sea represents a highway to their homes. Picabia's ex- uberant greeting "De Zayas! De Zayas!," which echoes the Greek outburst, exhibits the same joy. For both salva- tion is at hand. Following a tortuous journey through war- torn France and across the ocean, Picabia had finally found refuge in New York with his old friends.'7 Although the third portrait - a spark-plug (Fig. 19) - is nameless, Homer argues convincingly that it depicts Agnes Ernst Meyer.48 Indeed, since the series is devoted to the 291 editorial board, to which she belonged, mere process of elimination is enough to make the portrait hers. On one level, the spark-plug may symbolize her fondness for automobiles and motoring (one of her favorite pastimes was driving her limousine up and down Fifth Avenue). On another level, it may symbolize her personal qualities. Agnes Ernst Meyer, as Homer notes, was a dynamic, attractive woman whose marriage to a promi- nent banker made her financially independent. Stressing her role as patron of the arts, he concludes that Picabia portrayed her as "the spark that ignited the new energies within the Stieglitz group" in 1915. In other words, it is a flattering portrait. This interpretation is, however, incon- sistent with the mischievous tone of the other object- portraits. Here, as elsewhere in the series, Picabia clearly meant to be humorous. A visual poem published in 291 46 Homer ("Picabia's Jeune fille am&amp;ricaine," 111) claims that "Je suis venu sur les rivages du Pont-Euxin" is taken from Ovid's Tristia (v.4.1). In fact, Ovid says precisely the opposite: "I have come from the shores of the Black Sea" (litore ab Euxino Nasonis epistula veni); a letter he has sent to Rome is speaking. Whereas Ovid is miserable in exile, hence the ti- tle Tristia, Picabia is frankly exuberant at having escaped the war to find refuge in America. SWriting in July, de Zayas declared: "Of all those who have come to conquer America, Picabia is the only one who has done as did Cortez. He has burned his ship behind him... He has married America like a man who is not afraid of consequences" ("New York did not see at first," 291, v-vi, July-August, 1915, 6). 48 Homer, "Picabia's Jeune fille ambricaine," 111-15.</page><page sequence="17">450 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1980 VOLUME LXII NUMBER 3 FEMME!

Entitled "Mental Reactions" (Fig. 21), with drawings by de Zayas and text by Meyer, it records her reactions to an attractive man at a gathering. At the top, in the center of her caricature, de Zayas summarizes her behavior with the notation FLIRT. It appears from this that flirtation was Meyer's secret vice and that Picabia thought of her as an allumeuse - an erotic tease who promised more than she was prepared to deliver.49 Picabia's personal frustration is revealed by his title: An American Girl in a State of Nudity. If this refers to "the inner personal characteristics of Mrs. Meyer, laid bare, as it were," (as Homer writes), it also betrays the artist's desire to behold her in that very ELLE VoL~ ELLE 24 Picabia, Voili elle, from 291, November, 1915 state. In her capacity as a spark-plug perpetually sparking men's passions, she prefigures a Readymade Picabia published two years later in 391 (July, 1917). Consisting of a lightbulb with the inscriptions "Flirt" and "Divorce," it bears the title Ambricaine. For Picabia, then, Agnes Ernst Meyer personified American womanhood. From these two examples, it is apparent that Picabia's humor differs radically from de Zayas's. It is much bolder, much bawdier, and thoroughly French. Not unexpectedly, the mechanomorphic drawings differ from the caricatures in several other respects. Instead of algebraic equivalents, for example, Picabia uses titles and inscriptions. These are more accessible to the viewer and more expressive. (Once 9 Picabia never did learn to like the game. In a recently discovered novel, he comments: "You see, I have arrived at a point where a woman's face no longer matters! But the magnificent body of the American woman, who plays golf, dances, swims, drives a car, but doesn't know how to make love - that's why they invented flirtation. The Latin lover, however, has so much experience that he is almost a professional" (Caravansbrail, Paris, 1974, 71).

The same substitution occurs in his Stieglitz portrait published in 291 in March, 1915, in which he introduces the phrase "291 throws back its forelock.") More important, Picabia does not carry the general process of abstraction as far as de Zayas. He prefers to stop after the first step, focusing on the machine itself instead of its abstract reduction. What interests him is the concept of an illusionistic realism functioning within a symbolic framework. He delights in toying with the viewer's expectations. The simple, clean lines of his machines imply that the drawings will be easily un- derstandable. The illusion of physical realism implies that the correct interpretation lies at the same level. Already, however, there is a hint of Picabia's future development. By the end of the year, the tendency toward further abstraction evident in the self-portrait and in De Zayas! De Zayas! leads him to reject realism altogether. One of the first examples of his new style appears in the Decem- ber issue of 291. As Camfield has shown, Fantaisie (Fig. 22) is actually an extreme reduction of a nineteenth- century horizontal-beam steam engine.50 Although Picabia is no longer interested in portraiture per se, in this and other works he returns to de Zayas's principle of double abstraction. This schematic mode permits him to comment on philosophical problems, personal relationships, and life in general. Additional examples of artistic interaction between de Zayas and Picabia are plentiful. The years 1915-16 mark the period of their closest collaboration, which is most ob- vious in two works dating from November, 1915. Published side by side in 291, de Zayas's visual poem "Elle" (Fig. 23) and Picabia's mechanomorphic drawing Voilii elle (Fig. 24) are practically identical. One critic reported that "according to the artists' sworn word these works were portraits of the same woman made at different times and in different places 'without collusion.' "sl This is hard to believe. Situated at the intersection of caricature and machinism, both works portray the same woman in an identical manner. The titles are virtually the same (in both cases "elle" is in capitals), as is their placement. The chosen language is French. Compositionally, both works feature a single vertical upright surmounted by a larger mass; both have a marked diagonal component extending from the lower left to the upper right corner; and both use a curved element (at the left) to connect the vertical with the diagonal. Camfield has shown that Picabia's drawing represents a pistol aimed at a target and connected to it by mechanical linkage so that, once the trigger is pulled, it will continue to fire indefinitely. We are dealing with sex- ual symbols here, and the portrait depicts a woman with nymphomaniacal tendencies.52 This interpretation is rein- forced, moreover, by a cable running from the target to a furnace in the background. As each bullet strikes the target it stokes the "furnace" higher and higher. De Zayas's poem is an equally scathing denunciation of the unknown woman, who is wholly devoted to carnal gratification and suffering from "cerebral atrophy." In addition, the phrase "une ligne droite trac~e par une main mrcanique" ("a straight line traced by a mechanical hand") refers to the hand holding the gun in Picabia's drawing and to its mechanical linkage. All in all, the resemblance between these two works is so striking that it cannot possibly be coincidental. In January, 1917, one year after the demise of 291, Picabia founded the review 391 with the intention of furthering the experiments of its predecessor. Not sur- prisingly 391 continued the pattern of reference and 50 Camfield (as cited in n. 8), 81-82. 5' Anon., Arts and Decoration, November, 1915, 35ff. Acknowledging that his visual poems were based on experiments by Apollinaire and the Futurists, de Zayas used the term "psychotype" to describe them ("291 - A New Publication," Camera Work, XLVIII, October, 1916, 62). His definition, like the term itself, was taken from an article by Ambd~e Ozenfant ("Psychotypie &amp; typombtrique," L'Elan, Ix, February, 1916, in- side front cover): "Psychotype, an art which consists in making the typographical characters participate in the expression of the thoughts and in the painting of the states of soul, no more as conventional symbols but as signs having a significance in themselves." 52 See Camfield, 85.</page><page sequence="19">452 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1980 VOLUME LXII NUMBER 3 rpr ~*t~ ,t c. . ..: 4"Cc .'?t~"?? ..Y;O ~ LI- ?r. 9 I `'Y ~ L~i''?~Ci~s~ipn"~:~c"'~:~fr~!~d~!~~ c'rcrtr I Ct~ : F C ?' ~? ?r: t. ~.~.. ?? ~~?r r. i. . i ~~T- -?? .r. ..?. j' ~..:. ? iD1. r, ~ $I?? ~?. ~a, ro~J 26 John Covert, Time, 1919.

In connection with a fictitious lecture at- tributed to de Zayas, Picabia published a sketch of him in March (Fig. 25). De Zayas immediately retaliated with a caricature of Picabia, appearing in 391 in June.53 Their relationship had revolved around this art form for so long that each instinctively resorted to it to communicate with the other. Although Picabia's mechanomorphic style was destined to play a major role in modern art, de Zayas's caricatures gradually faded into the background. Becoming in- creasingly preoccupied with the business side of the art world, de Zayas failed to exploit his discoveries and even- tually abandoned caricature altogether. In spite of this, his drawings and theories enjoyed considerable success. Their influence is evident in caricatures by Edward Steichen and Katharine Rhoades published in 291 and, to some extent, in works by John Covert and Jean Crotti. Using up- holstery tacks and mathematical expressions, Covert's Time (Fig. 26) combines algebraic and geometric equivalents in a manner resembling abstract caricature. Dating from 1916, Crotti's construction Clown (Fig. 27) is strangely reminiscent of de Zayas's earlier Stieglitz por- trait. Like the latter, it expresses a personal vision of the artist as soul-catcher, though its focus is popular rather than elitist. Crotti adds color, a triangular hat, and a springy backbone to portray a clown juggling four balls before the fascinated gaze of his audience. Of course de Zayas's indirect influence - via Picabia - was much greater. The repercussions of the mechanomorphic style, chronicled by Camfield and Agee, are still being felt today. Ultimately Picabia's style was his own, but its success was due in no small part to the vitality of de Zayas's original inspiration.
