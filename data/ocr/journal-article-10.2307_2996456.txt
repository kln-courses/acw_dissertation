<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Coastal Wilderness to Fruited Plain: A History of Environmental Change in Temper- ate North America from 1500 to the Present. By Gordon G. Whitney. xxxiv + 451 p., in- cluding 15 black and white photographs, 34 tables and 36 figures. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K. 1994. $69.95 cloth. ISBN 0-521-39452-X. The grandeur of the disturbed vista illustrated in Thomas Cole's painting, "The Oxbox" that graces the dustcover conveys a powerful image maintained throughout this book by well-known ecologist, Gordon Whitney. This is a history book written by an ecologist, making it imminently readable for me. The author frequently quotes from, brings alive, and puts into context, many letters, old documents, reports and manuscripts. This material is put into the framework of cur- rent thinking through reference to the ecological literature. Perhaps the best of many quotations taken from historical and classic works is one by Aldo Leopold (1945) that sums up the message of the book, "Wildlife is never destroyed ... it is simply converted from one form to another." As Whitney points out, this is not to say that the massive changes in the natural ecosystems of temperate North America are unimportant or of little consequence. As with the Europeans who have been living in a synanthropomorphic re- lationship with their landscape for more than a thousand years, North America is "neither a lost paradise nor a land of endless resources." North America is a palimpsest erased by glaciation, and now by Man. It is the rapidity and scale of the current changes that are of concern. The book reminds me of Rackham's (1986) masterful treatment of the British landscape 156</page><page sequence="2">1995] BOOK REVIEWS 157 (Rackham, 0. 1986. The History of the Coun- tryside. J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., London. 445 p.) Whitney approaches the subject in a similar way. He first describes the advantages and lim- itations of the various types of source material available for documenting historical ecology, e.g., the written materials (travelers' accounts, etc.), graphical materials (maps and photographs), land survey records, farm account books, and more standard ecological evidence (e.g., stand struc- ture, tree form, pollen analysis). Three chapters ("Nature imposes . . . " "The forest primeval," and "Preservers of the ecological balance wheel") then follow describing the state of the landscape before European settlement. With so little left of the presettlement ecosystems, imagining what it must have really looked like is difficult. Can we really imagine the corn fields of central Illinois as the low lying, wet, impassable Grand Prairie? Was North America really once "one immense uninterrupted forest" as noted by Baird in 1832? Nevertheless, by drawing upon historical re- cords, Whitney paints a vivid picture. The main bulk of the book is then devoted to describing the anthropomorphic effects on the northeastern North American landscape. Deforestation, ploughing up the prairies, soil erosion, wetland drainage, invasions of exotic species, loss of in- digenous flora and fauna, and the rise of the con- servation movement are all covered in the next 10 chapters. Throughout, the author attempts to "provide a detailed exploration of the reciprocal relationship of society and the New World's re- sources...." In other words, the manner in which human activities shaped and changed the land- scape to suit their needs is described. However, the environment in turn constrained or limited the use to which the land was put. For example, Whitney argues that the apparent "slovenly" American farming (e.g., shifting cultivation, long fallow periods, lack of fertilizer application) was, in fact, the most sensible approach to farming given the social, cultural, and economic circum- stances at the time. This is in contrast to the "correct" and traditional European system of husbandry where acreage was limited and labor cheap. Whitney addresses many of these histor- ical misconceptions and backs up his arguments with many citations to source material. One of the more contentious issues addressed is that of the frequency and extent of the use of fire by Native Americans. In my mind, he clearly shows that they were much more than interested ob- servers merely augmenting natural fires. The Na- tive Americans clearly set and used fire sufficient to alter the landscape. This book is not a history of North American agriculture or forestry. It documents how chang- ing land use practices altered the landscape. The emphasis is on the ecological effects, and as such held my interest throughout. Perhaps the most dramatic, and sombre part is the photographic essay placed before the Introduction. In most books, the photographs are placed in the middle somewhere and the reader will, eventually, look through them. But, placing the photographs at the start drives home the message before hardly a page has been turned; i.e., the demise of pre- settlement vegetation. For me, it was not so much the loss of habitat that the old black and white photographs illustrated, it was the magnificence of the large trees. How many of us have seen a 15-foot diameter sycamore, or a 2-foot diameter, mature American chestnut? It is a powerful mes- sage that makes me wonder whether the second- or third-growth forests that make up the vast majority of the eastern deciduous forest can ever look the same. Incidentally, the empirical system of measurements is used throughout most of the book, although a conversion table to metric units is provided in the frontispiece, along with a list of the common and scientific names used in the text. Strangely, a main goal of the book, to "high- light the response of the two societies [that of England and New England] to their respective environments" is not mentioned until p. 121. Nevertheless, the chapter dealing with this topic (Ch 6 "European precedents"), and the frequent references to this comparison throughout the rest of the book, makes fascinating reading. Of course, North America and New England in particular were settled by more than just the English. Much of the ecological history presented in the book is founded upon the European traditions, modified, sometimes substantially, as the European settlers encountered a resource-rich and seemingly end- less environment (the "fruited plain"). The writing style is fluid and easy going. I not- ed only two typographic errors in the entire text and the quality of the tables and figures is high. The 106 pages of references provide a wealth of sources, although some of those from the nine- teenth century may be difficult to obtain. This book is well worth reading, and probably buying too, by any ecologist or botanist working in northeastern North America. The actual geo- graphic boundaries of Whitney's study area are</page><page sequence="3">158 BULLETIN OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB [VOL. 122 not always entirely clear as sometimes the ma- terial on a topic seems limited to one area, prob- ably reflecting the availability of historical sources. It is stated that the book covers the Northeast and the Midwest, and coverage west of Illinois and Wisconsin is limited. To the south the book covers territory from Kentucky and Virginia north. Unfortunately, the coverage stops at the United States northern boundary and does not cross into Canada. The organization and depth of coverage would make this an appro- priate text for a senior or graduate level ecology or landscape ecology course. The book should be on reading lists for courses dealing with the landscape history of the northeast. The chapter on exotic and invasive plants (Ch 13, "A trans- ported flora") is also of value for population ecol- ogists and conservationists that deal with this issue.-DAVID J.

ANNOUNCEMENT List of Invasive Exotic/Alien/Nonindigenous Plant Species. Faith T. Campbell has taken a new position as Governmental Liaison for a co- alition of Exotic Pest Plant councils (EPPCs). Initially, she will be representing the EPPCs of Florida, Tennessee, and the Pacific Northwest. The EPPCs expect to form a national association in the coming months. Ms. Campbell will help the EPPCs offer their expertise to federal agencies responsible for identification and control of alien invasive plant species (including the land-man- aging agencies, APHIS, and the National Bio- logical Survey); persuade Congress to amend the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974 to eliminate glaring weaknesses that undermine its effective- ness; and build public understanding by coor- dinating production of fact sheets on the threat to biodiversity posed by invasive alien plant spe- cies. An early priority is to develop a list of plant species which threaten to become invaders of natural areas. Working from lists prepared by the EPPCs of Florida and California, several state native plant societies, The Nature Conservancy, and a compilation state noxious weed lists pre- pared by Bonnie Harper-Lore of the U.S. De- partment of Transportation, she has prepared an initial list for the continental United States. A review of the information available so far indi- cates that some 8 grasses, 28 herbs, 8 vines, 12 shrubs, 5 trees, and only 1 aquatic plant (hydrilla) are problems in 5 or more continental states. She is now asking whether you would like to assist the EPPCs by reviewing this list and suggesting</page><page sequence="4">1995] ANNOUNCEMENTS 159 additions, deletions, or other changes. She is par- ticularly interested in learning additional states in which species already on the list have proved troublesome. She also seeks assistance in ensur- ing that plants are properly divided into the cat- egories of grasses, herbaceous plants, vines, shrubs, trees, and aquatic plants. People in Ha- waii have been asked to compile a list of the most damaging invasive plant species on those islands to supplement the continental list. If you would like to help, please contact Ms. Campbell at 8208 Dabney Avenue, Springfield, VA 22152. You may express interest in any or all of the following: review the continental list; contribute to the Hawaiian list; assist in lobbying Congress; assist in lobbying APHIS, land-man- aging agencies, etc.; otherwise wish to be kept informed about the issue and the work being done; or wish to join the California, Florida, Pa- cific Northwest, or Tennessee EPPCs.
