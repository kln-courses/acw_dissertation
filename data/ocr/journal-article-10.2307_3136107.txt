<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELIGIOUS AWAKENING OF FRANCE ALBERT SCHINZ, PH.D. Professor in Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts In these days all the world is thinking of France. For years we were told that it was losing its spiritual vigor. How far from true were these opinions events have shown. But how can we account for this spiritual power of the land ? How far is it of religious origin? How far is it sympathetic with religion? Such questions as these we need to have answered, and PROFESSOR Scmwz answers them. To understand well what has taken place in France in recent years, we will first summarize what the attitude toward religious problems was during the last generations. This will bring out the contrast with present conditions. But then we will try, too, to record as briefly as possible the various events which gradually and quietly prepared the rather sudden outburst of idealism about one or two years before the war; this may answer the argument of those who, having failed to notice, or having for- gotten, foreboding signs, pronounce the whole movement artificial. I To be complete we ought to describe the tremendous impulse given to areli- gious thought by the scientific discov- eries of the first half of the nineteenth century. But we may take it for granted that our readers are familiar with that subject. We need only recall that A. Comte's six volumes of Cours de phi- losophie positive came out from 1830-4o; and that this bulky work provided agnos- tic philosophy with its leading thoughts for many years to come. Two theories were particularly sig- nificant. The first, that of the evolution of the human mind, concerned the prob- lem of truth: in its earliest days men explained the world as the expression of the personal will of God; then they gave up anthropomorphic gods for impersonal, metaphysical causes; and finally, dis- missing even these metaphysical expla- nations, they limited themselves to the study of such causes as would come directly under the observation of the human mind; the two first ages, theo- logical and metaphysical, have come to a close, the positive age is just really be- ginning. The second theory, which is, of course, intimately connected with the first, is that psychic-thus moral, social, and religious-phenomena are as much amenable to scientific investigation as merely so-called physical phenomena; it is simply because they are more complex that they have so long escaped scientific investigation. It was natural that the comparatively simpler sciences should reach first the positive stage: on this logico-chronological development of hu- man knowledge rests the famous classifi- cation of science of Comte; mathematics comes first, being independent of any concrete phenomena; then comes as- tronomy, which deals only with bodies moving freely in space; upon astronomy 67</page><page sequence="2">68 THE BIBLICAL WORLD follows physics, dealing still with laws of motion, not merely in open space, how- ever, and of a more complex nature-- light waves, sound vibrations, molecular motions of various kinds; this analysis of natural bodies was preparing for a more scientific conception of chemical action, and alchemy became chemistry; again, a better knowledge of chemistry would allow biology to reach a scientific stage; biology would form a good basis for psychology; and psychology for sociology, or the science of humanity. Former speculations had naively inferred, from the fact that natural causes are less easy to see and define as one goes from astronomy to psychology and sociology, that the latter are less "determined" by natural causes; while, as a matter of fact, if anything there is more determin- ism as one gets to the more complex phe- nomena of life. As can easily be seen, positivism meant a sort of continuous and gradual squeez- ing out of all contingencies and all ideal- ism in life. Why care about our past, why aspire to higher things, why indulge in religious hopes, if all is dependent on a rigid system of naturalcauses and effects ? The second generation of positivists or agnostics in France had more influence than the first. The public mind was no longer startled by their theories, which no longer bore the stamp of novelty; moreover, scholars were better equipped with facts, often discoveries useful to industry, which went to supporting also the claims of science. Hippolyte Taine was the powerful writer who imperson- ated that second phase of victory for agnosticism. In 1856 he had swept away prevailing ecclecticism in his book of terrific sarcasm, Les Philosophes clas- siques en France au XIX? sitcle. And in 1870 he struck the great blow by Intelli- gence; this is a formidable array of scien- tifically established facts all in line with Comte's idea: there is no social progress which cannot be accounted for by a men- tal or psychological process, which is itself closely connected with some physi- ological process, and, finally, "sensation is reduced to a group of molecular move- ments, a stream and a complex of sensa- tions and impulses, which, seen from another standpoint, are also a stream and a complex of nervous vibrations: voild r'esprit!"'' Then comes a new phase. Not satis- fied with banishing metaphysical or religious interpretation of mental phe- nomena, modern agnostics in France suggested boldly that science might re- place religion and give to humanity what the church had promised and more, namely, happiness. Of course, over a century and a half ago "philosophers" had promised as much; but the progress of science and of thought changed cir- cumstances so that it looked now like a new dogma. Determinism, it was ar- gued, is not fatalism; the knowledge of the strict and complete system of causes and effects in nature gives us the means of acting according to our wishes; we are no longer dependent on a metaphysical conscience and on an absolute willing power. Littr6, the disciple of Comte and the contemporary of Taine, was preaching that dogma with a conviction and even a loftiness that were impressive. In a momentous speech before the stu- dents of the Ecole Polytechnique in Bordeaux in February, 1871, he said: x Introduction.</page><page sequence="3">THE RELIGIOUS AWAKENING OF FRANCE 69 History is a natural phenomenon; and if as such it is not ruled by chance, it is not on the other hand ruled by our whims (arbi- traire). ..... The course of history can be modified through our intervention, which has become wise by learning and experience, judicious and foreseeing; and it is because the course of history can be altered that we have a part in the destinies of mankind.' Such views gained ground. One of the best-known philosophers in the fol- lowing years was Alfred Guyau, and his two most widely known books are L'irriligion de l'avenir (1887) and Es- quisse d'une morale sans obligation ni sanction (1890o). He rises against the tendency to try and save the various creeds from waning altogether by blend- ing them into a colorless and tasteless product. "In most books of today, the Religion of the Future is a kind of com- promise, somewhat hypocritical, with dogmatic religion."'2 He wants to go to the end of the "jugement individuel"; and: "One can count on that force in order to bring about, with the gradual decomposition of dogmatic creeds, the ultimate absence of religion."3 In 1890o, too, one of the most influen- tial thinkers of the nineteenth century, Renan, published his book, L'Avenir de la science (which had already been writ- ten in 1848, but the public mind was not prepared for it then): "to organize scien- tifically humanity [he underlines], such, then, is the last word of modern science, such its bold but legitimate pretense" (p. 37). And five years later the great chemist Berthelot (a friend of Renan) added the weight of his authority to similar views: We see every day how the application of scientific doctrines to industry increases the prosperity and wealth of nations..... The application of the same doctrines diminishes constantly suffering. The his- tory of this century also proves to what ex- tent the fate of all has been improved by the new ideas ..... Such are the results of the scientific method. Thus the universal tri- umph of science will finally assure to man the maximum of happiness and morality.4 The words which best characterize that whole trend of thought are the fol- lowing, from the pen of a much less illus- trious scholar, but for this reason perhaps reflecting more naively the prevailing tendencies in these years: "Religions are purified remainings (risidus &amp;puris) of superstitions..... The value of a civilization is in inverse ratio to religious fervor .... Every intellectual advance corresponds to an equal diminution of the supernatural in the world..... Future belongs to science."s This was in 1892. We shall see pres- ently that a counter-movement had been started some years before. This does not mean, however, that areligious views were no longer advocated; indeed, the truth is, that they reach their most consistent form of expression (with Littr6 excepted, however) long after the reaction had already set in. One needs only to recall such extremists as R~my de Gourmont in his Promenades philoso- phiques; and, besides Berthelot, who died only in 190o7 and who is responsible for the unfortunate words "le monde est aujourd'hui sans mystbre,"6 the phi- losopher Thdodule Ribot, who may well be considered the continuator in France La Science, p. 423. 2 Introduction. 3 Ibid. 4 Revue de Paris, February I, I1895. s Andre Lefivre, La Religion, pp. 572-73. 6 Origines de la chimie (1885), Preface.</page><page sequence="4">70 THE BIBLICAL WORLD of Comte and Taine. Comte had added a very surprising Religion de l'humanitk to his system of positive philosophy; Taine made some rather striking con- cessions later in life to religion (to Protestantism, as Balzac had made to Catholicism); but Ribot never one day waived from the straight line of agnosti- cism which he had adopted from the be- ginning of his career as a psychologist. He died during the war in the last days of 1916. Literature served as a medium be- tween the philosophers and the general public. Sainte-Beuve, and then, espe- cially again, Taine, introduced the "scientific" method at first in literary criticism. The latter, in his famous Introduction to the History of English Literature (I864), aroused storms of pro- test by his sentence: "Vice and virtue are natural products just as vitriol and sugar." Creative literature was not slow to follow: Flaubert's Madame Bovary is of 1857, Feydeau's Fanny of 1858, Goncourt's Germaine Lacerteux of 1865, etc. And after the Franco- Prussian War, which was very short, things went right on: Zola's "Rougon- Macquart" (18 vols.) series was pub- lished between 1871 and 1892. The priests were not infrequently taken as chief characters, either to show that they were as much the victims of human pas- sions as others, or for actual and direct attack. Zola's Faute de l'Abbi Mouret is of 1875, Prdvost's Scorpion of 1887, A. France's Abbe Coignard of 1893. Estaunid's Empreinte (1896) was a gloomy picture of the nefarious influ- ence of the church and especially of the Jesuits on the youth of France. Es- taunid did for Catholicism what Daudet had done as early as 1883 for Protestant- ism in l'Evangfliste. Finally, Zola's Three Cities (1898) opposed the religion of science to the religion of metaphysical dogmas and of charity. This is not the place to try to deter- mine just how far those ideas-which, it must be borne in mind, were per- haps more anti-ecclesiastical than anti- religious-penetrated the masses through the channel of literature; nor how much was due to new socialistic ideas which not only had not been initiated by the church, but had been actually opposed by the church; nor how much was due to other factors still. The fact remains that about twenty-five years ago Brenier de Montmorand could make a sad pic- ture of religion in France in his series of essays, La Socidt franpaise contemporaine (1899). The author tells us that the re- cruiting of the army of about forty thou- sand priests needed in France-an army recruited almost entirely from the labor- ing class and from the peasantry-was becoming harder and harder as the end of the nineteenth century was drawing nearer. Moreover, out of about forty million people in France, not over ten million altogether were baptized. And out of this forty million about one mil- lion were pratiquants, that is, active members of the church. In a rural com- munity near Paris he found that three men out of one hundred and sixty went to mass. Worse yet, there had always been Christians who would neglect their duties most of the year, but would still go to communion at Easter-time-but in a town near Paris, out of thirty thousand people, our author found that only twenty-five had even that much religious spirit left. If, moreover, the bourgeois</page><page sequence="5">THE RELIGIOUS AWAKENING OF FRANCE 71 class was observed occasionally to be supporting the clergy, the reason was- signs were very evident-not religious need or belief, but mere cowardly fear of too much thinking about social wrongs, and lest the working classes, if not kept in con- trol by some strong social or moral machine, should decide to act toward the bourgeois class as the bourgeois class had acted toward the nobility in I789..... . The fact is that today, as in I848, the bourgeois class is afraid; they are frightened before their own work-as Jaurbs has explained-and with- out daring to admit it, they want for their children, masters who can, in the name of some positive belief, teach efficiently the conservative dogmas which will assure bour- geois social security [p. 38]. Finally it may be well to remember that two important political laws were enacted during the last generation which are of interest here: the law of "separa- tion of church and school," of October 30, I886, which substituted "moral and civic instruction" in place of religious instruc- tion (such textbooks were introduced as Paul Bert's Instruction morale d l'&amp;cole, Burdeau's Devoir et Patrie, Compayr6's L'Instruction civique, etc.); and the law of "separation of church and state": the principle had been discussed since 1872; it became a law in 1905 only; the bill was voted by the Chamber on July 4 and by the Senate on December 6. If the law must be considered an evil for France-and very few believe that, it simply introduces an arrangement similar to that of the United States- one must grant that the clergy of France did not a little to hasten the blow through their regrettably and clumsily uncompromising attitude. The action of the political men of France was di- rected primarily against reactionary and unintelligent Catholic leaders, who ought to have understood that France could not be thankful to the Catholic party for having supported a monarchy which had led to Sedan. Just to oppose the repub- lic, they deliberately took the side of injustice in the Dreyfus affair; that was enough to bring about-some say to force on the French government-the law of separation.' II A reaction was bound to come. It started in the early eighties, which was (as already pointed out) before the agnostic movement had developed its most extreme views. It started as soon as the danger of threatening conse- quences was fully apparent; was, how- ever, echoed in literary criticism only ten years later; and ten more years elapsed before its influence on creative literature would be somewhat felt. The rising in arms was prepared simultaneously in two different quarters: in the church itself, and in the world of scholars. The church had remained compara- tively quiet on the question of dogma since the publication of the Syllabus (or list of the errors condemned by the church in modern thinkers) in 1864. The first skirmish of a long battle was to be fought outside of France. In 1878, soon after ascending the papal throne, Leo XIII published his first Encyclical on Modern Errors. The answer to that was SThe story of the conflict is told very clearly in Bracq's France under the Third Republic, chapter xiv. The bitterness of the author's own feelings against the Catholic clergy gives some of his words a partial turn; the facts, however, are accurately stated.</page><page sequence="6">72 THE BIBLICAL WORLD given by Belgium, where, in 1879, the civil power suppressed the teaching of religion, up to then required in the schools. The same year the Pope issued a new Encyclical-On Christian Philoso- phy, and in 1880 he recommended that a special chair be founded at the Univer- sity of Louvain to foster the study of Thomas Aquinas. The philosophy of the Doctor Angelicus, he thought, would offer a solid basis for a revival of scholas- ticism. In 1888 he went farther and sug- gested the foundation of the Institut de Philosophie Thomiste within the Uni- versity, sending 50,000ooo francs to carry out the plan. In 1889 Mgr. Mercier-- famous the world over since the war by his firm attitude toward the invaders of his country-was elected head, and in 1894 the Institut was in running order. The same year a periodical was launched, the Revue Ndoscolastique, with the telling motto, "Nova et Vetera," under the direction of Professor de Wulf; the whole movement was a bold and able attempt to unite, under the same review cover, Catholic dogma and modern science. From Louvain the movement spread rapidly to Holland (as early as 1894 a Dominican, De Groot, obtained a chair to teach Thomism in the Protestant University of Amsterdam), to England (where Mgr. Vaughan voiced some un- easiness on the part of Protestantism), to Germany; less to Italy; but, of course, to France, where in the meanwhile the separation of school and church had taken place (law of October 30, 1886); the Annales de philosophie Chr~tienne, together with the Revue Thomiste (1894), took to task the agnostic theories of Comte, Taine, Weissman, Ribot, etc.' Even more spectacular-in spite, or perhaps because, of the modesty of the protagonist-was the first public protest against agnosticism uttered by a repre- sentative of the scholarly world. In 1882 Pasteur was received in the French Academy. His speech will re- main one of the noblest pieces of oratory in the French language. Following the custom, he first made a eulogy of his predecessor in the Academy, Littrd. Littr6 had been, as we know, the leader of French agnostics, and thus the representative of a philosophy entirely opposed to Pasteur's, but a most gener- ous eulogy it was. Then fearlessly, at a time when all scientific minds were thought to run in an opposite direction, Pasteur asserted his belief in a higher order of things: Positivism does not take into account the most important of positive notions, that of the Infinite ..... What is beyond? The human mind, actuated by an invisible force, will never cease to ask itself, What is be- yond? .... It is of no use to answer: ' This revival of Thomistic philosophy corresponds to the remarkable revival of Catholicism in America as directed by Mgr. Ireland of St. Paul, Cardinal Gibbons in Baltimore, and later Cardinal O'Connor in the now Catholic city of Boston. Two years in succession, 1915 and 1916, Professor de Wulf, of Louvain, came to Harvard to teach mediaeval philosophy. Soon books reflecting these efforts were thrown on the market: by de la Bouillerie in 1880, by Doumet de Vorges in 1883, by Regnon in 1886, and especially by de Wulf, Histoire de la phi- losophie medilvale, 1900oo; in 19o5 Picavet published his Esquisse de l'histoire g&amp;ndrale des philosophies medidvales; not to speak, outside of the academic world, of Henri Lasserre's Episodes miraculeux (1883), destined to revive the interest in the famous sanctuary which the same author had so much aroused in 1883 in his Notre-Damne de Lourdes. Zola's Lourdes, an attempt to stem the tide, is of 1894; that of Huysmans, Les Foules de Lourdes, of g19o6.</page><page sequence="7">THE RELIGIOUS AWAKENING OF FRANCE 73 Beyond is limitless space, limitless time, or limitless volume. No one understands these words. He who proclaims the exist- ence of the Infinite-and none can avoid it-- accumulates in that affirmation more of the supernatural than is to be found in all the literatures of all the religions ..... When this notion seizes upon our understanding, we can but kneel .... the idea of God is a form of the idea of the Infinite. As long as the mystery of the Infinite weighs upon human thought, temples will be erected for worship, whether God is called Brahma, Allah, Jehovah, or Jesus; and on the pave- ment of those temples, men will be seen kneeling, prostrated, annihilated, in the thought of the Infinite. From that day it was no longer con- sidered necessarily a moral superiority to ignore religion. The following year A. Fouill6e pub- lished his keen Critique des systtmes de morale contemporains, which can be taken as an answer to Ribot's Psychologie anglaise contemporaine-icole experimen- tale (1870). Still these were rather negative mani- festations. The fire only smoldered for several years before signs of a more posi- tive attempt can be recorded. In 1889 only, Bergson came out with his Donnies immtdiates de la conscience, which "don- noes," or data, were to be trusted more than the data of our senses, and even of our intellect. This book marked the first step toward Bergson's gradual re-edition of Pascal's theory: "Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait pas." In the meanwhile Emile Boutroux started a parallel campaign against posi- tivism in his Contingence des lois de la nature, followed in 1895 by De l'idde des lois naturelles, and in I9o8 by Science et religion dans la philosophie contempo- raine. There were, however, much less constructive elements involved than in Bergson-where there were not very many. In 1892 the Revue de mttaphysique et de morale was started, with the non- concealed purpose of counteracting the influence of Ribot's Revue philosophique, issued since 1876. The two attempts to do constructive work on a psychological basis, by Guyau, Esquisse d'une morale sans obligation ni sanction, and by Fouill6e, Evolution des idles-forces (1890), ought to be men- tioned here. But the stunning blow was struck in 1895 by the great literary critic Brune- tibre in an epoch-making article of the Revue des deux mondes on the "Bank- ruptcy of Science." This manifest marks plainly, as well in literature as in phi- losophy, the passing from the defensive to the offensive: In fact, physical and natural sciences had promised to us to do away with mystery. Now, not only did they not do away with it, but we see clearly today that they will never throw any light on it. They are powerless, I do not say to solve, but even to state ade- quately the only questions which are of importance, those which deal with the ori- gin of man, with the laws of his conduct, with his destiny [p. 29]. Brunetibre establishes a distinction between what is not understood (and may be of the domain of science), and what cannot be understood (which is be- yond science's reach): "Le merveilleux n'est pas le mystire." Against such phi- losophers as were trying hard to show that the best of Christian dogmas were not unknown to pagan moralists of Greece and Rome, he remarks: "They</page><page sequence="8">74 THE BIBLICAL WORLD have forgotten only one point, namely, to tell us why, if Christianity is already entire in Hellenism, Hellenism did not produce Christianity. Yet there lies the whole question . . . ." (p. 25). In- deed, "if it is true that since one hundred years science has pretended to replace religion, then science has lost the game. .... If we were to ask Darwinism to teach us Ethics, that teaching would be abominable" (p. 38). Moreover, to go to the root of things: "The gravest mis- take, perhaps, which the philosophy of the last century has made-Diderot as much and perhaps more than Rousseau is responsible for it-is to have replaced by the dogma of the natural goodness of man the dogma of original sin" (p. 84).' The article "Science et Religion" was followed by others and by a series of elo- quent Discours de combat. Let us note, too, La Morale de la doctrine &amp;volutive and La Renaissance de l'iddalisme, in which he already sees as an accomplished fact the triumph of religion over areligion and amoralism. "'There are no more mys- teries,' exclaimed not long ago an illus- trious chemist; and to utter that cry, what moment did he choose ? The very moment when from all sides the short- comings of positivism and naturalism be- came evident to the eyes of the most prejudiced" (p. 34, second speech). The efforts of Brunetibre aimed at leading France back to national tradi- tions. Bossuet was to him the ideal figure in French letters, as Bossuet was the best incarnation of France of the classical age. The greatest book ever written in France, our author claimed, was Bossuet's Histoire des variations des dglises protestantes. But the opposition of Catholics and Protestants in France must not be em- phasized at the expense of the fundamen- tal points of contact. A good proof of it is here: a movement in France, which, in fact, but without intending specially to do so, did not little to support Brune- tibre's contentions, was brilliantly con- ducted by men of Protestant origin, spiritual sons of Calvin and Rousseau. In 1883-84 the Journal intime by Amiel, a professor in Geneva, came out; and, although perhaps not the great book some have thought, its success in France as well as in Protestant countries showed how ready people were to proceed to a thorough examination of their own moral self and to assume a serious, if melan- choly, attitude toward life. Then Charles Secr6tan, who had had a very distinguished career as a philoso- pher (his Philosophie de la libert8 is of 1872), published his Principes de la morale in 1884, to be followed in 1889 by his Civilisation et Croyance--this title indicates well enough the content. A third name is that of Edmond Sch6rer, the keen literary critic. He had, it is true, severed officially his con- nection with Protestantism; but his trend of thought remained, in spite of all, that of his youth, and in 1884, spurred by an article of Beaussire on "La Crise actuelle de la morale" (in Revue des deux mondes), he himself wrote a capital paper in which the following lines occur: 'A great banquet was organized in Paris as a manifestation against Brunetibre's article. It took place on April 4, at Saint-Mand6, in an immense hall accommodating one thousand diners; Raymond Poincar&amp;--then minister of public instruction-presided; the guest of honor was the chemist, Berthelot, attacked by Brunetibre.</page><page sequence="9">THE RELIGIOUS AWAKENING OF FRANCE 75 Let us look at things as they are; moral- ity, the real, the good, the old, the impera- tive morality needs the absolute, it aspires to transcendency, finds a support in God. Conscience is like the heart, it needs the Beyond. Duty is nothing if it is not sub- lime, and life is a frivolous thing unless it involves eternal relations.' But more important even than these three-and although his name perhaps is known chiefly as a writer of fiction-is E. Rod. His case is all the more inter- esting since he had been at first a follower of Zola (see Palmyre Veulard, 188i), even breaking a lance in favor of realism (A Propos de l'assommoir, 1879); but then he had soon foreseen the fatal results of such literature; he cried, "Look out!" in Course d la mort (1885); he went farther toward a spiritual view of life in Sens de la vie (1889). In 1891 he made a hit in the world of literature and philo- sophical criticism by his Idles morales du temps present, in which he said plainly: "Intelligence is destructive, this is the brutal fact which one must frankly recog- nize as certain" (p. 116). In not very different terms from those which Brune- tibre had used in the Roman naturaliste, he comments thus on Zola: Christianity, which he rebukes, and sci- ence, which he accepts as a religion, have this in common, that their basis is equally uncer- tain, beyond observation. To believe in the heredity of the Rougon-Macquart family, an act of faith is required at least equal to that required for the dogmas of the Trinity, or of the Immaculate Conception; and after hav- ing consented to it, possibly one would get less help out of it [p. 82]. It would not be well to forget here the part played in this campaign for idealism by the eloquent pastor Ch. Wagner. His most famous books came out a little later (Jeunesse, 1892, Vaillance and Vie simple, 1895), but since his arrival in Paris in 1882 he had worked indefati- gably for the same cause. This movement, supported chiefly by liberal Protestant writers, was finally summarized in a little book of less than a hundred pages; the sensation created was as great as the volume was small. It is almost forgotten now, because it has been outgrown as far as its con- tents are concerned; but its historical significance remains, as the manifest of the layman against the ethics which the public thought (on purpose we say thought, for Zola's own moral intentions had been misunderstood most of the time) to be involved in realistic writings. Le Devoir present was signed by Paul Desjardins on Christmas Day, i89i. Some statements deserve to be repro- duced here: There is today between ourselves and many of our contemporaries an irreducible disagreement which must be realized, a great fight where one must take sides: is there any meaning in life, an ideal, a duty, or do we struggle for no reason and for no aims, for the amusement of some demiurge, or to satisfy the caprices of the great Pan ? .... There are two types of minds facing each other, the destructive and the constructive .... and there are reasons to believe that the constructive minds gain in influence. We are satiated with the search for new sen- sations and try to hear some call from higher up. Never, I believe, have people been more generally depressed than in these re- cent times [p. 17]. We all pine for healing, and this is a sign for hope. Now "moral ideas are, SEtudes de litt. contemp., VIII, 182-83.</page><page sequence="10">76 THE BIBLICAL WORLD before everything else, forces. They are the organic strength of the soul, as there is an organic force in an acorn which will make it become an oak" (p. 21). "The essential thing is to start, and, God be blessed for it, we have started already" (p. 33). The author mentions, in sup- port of his belief of "growing idealism," the writings of M. de Vogue; the verses of Verlaine; in art, the "Bois sacra" by Puvis de Chavannes; in music, the "Beatitudes" of Cisar Franck. To the question whether they want to let the church take charge of the movement, he says "No," although he is not negative on the subject. "Our object is broader than that of the Roman Catholic church and includes it. Our position is not at one of the sources-Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or philosophical-but at the place where they all meet" (p. 44). The goal is to get at "some sort of interior Christianity which every noble soul can recognize as his own idea" (p. 69). Paul Desjardins was the founder of the "Union pour 1'Action Morale," which has become later, if our informa- tion is correct, the "Union pour la V~rit~ "-and the spirit of which is still found in the "Ligue des Droits de l'Homme," of which Ferdinand Buisson is the president. Many writers and artists who did not show any particular anxiety over the religious or moral issue of the day-at least at the beginning-withdrew none the less and deliberately their sup- port to scientifico-realism as a principle of art. They contributed their full share toward the emancipation of the French minds from the clutches of posi- tivism. The whole movement of symbolism and so-called decadentism-which even literary critics understood so late and which was started in I885-was chiefly a reaction against science meddling with art. Symbolism favored anything that would keep off the oppressive discipline of pseudo-scientific bigotry. This was the time when Mallarm6 in- dulged in such frantic flights into the spheres of the unreal, which leave his Apris-midi d'un faune a puzzle, most characteristic of his generation. And that was the time when Verlaine revolted against stiffness in poetry, starting the movement of vers librism: De la musique avant toute chose Et pour cela pr~fire l'impair Plus vague et plus soluble dans l'air Sans rien en lui qui pise ou pose. And the time, too, when Maeterlinck began his Thlztre des marionnettes where the unreal reigns supreme, where mani- festations of the soul are offered as a sort of fluid mixture of sensations, feelings, and passions, more so than was ever dreamed of by the worst Platonic, gnos- tic, or mystic despisers of human knowl- edge. These were the years when people did not know whether they were mysti- fied or whether they ought to take seri- ously the "Ethopies" of the ?ar P6ladan; his series of books on La Dicadence latine (the "decadence" being "slavery to real- ism") was a mixture of esoterism, occult- ism, erotism, and any heterogeneous "isms" that would not remind one of a concrete world (Vice supreme, I884; Ini- tiation sentimentale, i886; Istar, i888; Androgyne, I891, etc.). Not many years after, Jules Bois published his suggestive "metapsychical" revelations on Petites</page><page sequence="11">THE RELIGIOUS AWAKENING OF FRANCE 77 religions de Paris (1894) and on Satan- isme et Magie (1895). It was the time, last but not least, when Renan, after having directed his skepticism against the Christianity of his youth, directed some of it against the dogmatism of sci- ence as well; for skepticism is a double- edged sword, and it is rather strange that critics have not noted the difference be- tween the later Renan and the former. "Man sees well now," Renan writes in his Preface to the Drames philosophiques (i888), "that he will never know about the supreme cause of the universe nor about his own destiny. And yet he wants to be talked to on these subjects." And Renan consents to talk for 56o pages. But the attitude of the public in such matters (the books they wish to read) is as important as the speculations of the thinkers themselves; the best test of public opinion in modern times is the novel. A very few examples known by all will suffice to show how sweeping the change has been. As a negative reaction against realism we note first P. Loti's novels, with their intense emotionalism so different from cold objectivism on the one hand, and on the other with their sobs of despair before a world deprived, owing to the triumph of scientific fetishism, of hope and love. Just as skepticism in philosophy is equivalent to a need for a new philoso- phy, so pessimism in ethics is equivalent to a need for salvation. Loti's Frdre Ives is of 1883, Pecheurs d'islande is of i886. But Loti's was a cold, haughty sad- ness, like Vigny's a century ago; and if some exceptional beings can assume that attitude of haughtiness against God, whom they conceive as ignoring human suffering, the average soul, when tormented morally, will not--be- cause it cannot--remain without some source of consolation. The note of Christian sympathy was then reintro- duced in French literature through the medium of the Russian novel. The pref- ace of Melchoir de Vogu6 to his capti- vating book Le Roman Russe (i886) marks a date in French thought. He wants the French to understand that to them who have been fed so long on the stones of impassible science, of a pitiless and needlessly brutal reality, he offers once more a loaf of bread, the bread of humanitarianism, of Christian sympa- thy, too. He proposes to do away with that art "which is trying to imitate nature in her unconsciousness, her moral apathy, her determinism, and expresses the triumph of collectivity over the in- dividual, of the mob over the hero, of the relative over the absolute." Once be- fore, in the eighteenth century, the world had done away with metaphysics, God seemed useless and thus was given up; the utopia of rationalism, however, brought about the reaction of romanti- cism. It is true that realism answers one of our aspirations when it studies life with rigorous accuracy, when it looks for the slightest causes of our actions; but it deceives our surest instincts when it ignores willingly the mystery which remains beyond the rational explanations, and the possible factor of the divine ..... Realism is right in repeating after the Bible: "And the God Lord formed man of the dust of the ground .. . ."; but the Bible adds: "and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." And indeed, life begins only when we cease to under- stand.</page><page sequence="12">78 THE BIBLICAL WORLD Modern men of letters "ignore the better half of us." After all, did not Flaubert go at once the whole length of realism and naturalism in showing us in Mme. Bovary the absurd product of man trying to find his aspirations within him- self? And even better, Bouvard: Ecce homo! Bouvard, here is the man such as progress, science, the immortal prin- ciples have made him, when he was not directed by a Grace from above; he is an educated idiot who turns within a circle of ideas as a squirrel in his cage ..... Bou- vard et P6cuchet, this is the last word, the necessary ending of realism, without belief, without emotion, without charity..... One takes hold of us men only in uplifting us from the ground. That the public was ready for this Russian gospel is shown by the fact that in 1887 five of the fornier followers of Zola broke away from him, or rather from the principles of the school. The famous Manifeste des cinq (signed by Guiche, P. Margueritte, L. Descaves, G.-H. Rosny, Bonnetain) is a none too equitable appreciation of the theories of the master. It describes products of realism as "superficial observation .... using old-fashioned tricks, commonplace narration, and without any character ... in which the filthy tone is stressed to extreme." And five years later in his Idles morales Rod could write, discuss- ing Tolstoi: "To speak of a spiritual revival at the present hour is common- place." From that time, i886-whether di- rectly or indirectly connected with M. de Vogue's initiative-spiritual pre- occupations gained admission gradually to the French novel. Let us mention only Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's Tribulat Bonhomet (1887), in which is opposed "the light of dream to the darkness of common sense." Villiers had already shown his love for fancy as opposed to so-called objectivism when he had ex- pressed in metaphysical terms, so to speak, the genius of Edison in his Eve Future (i886). He was going to show a little later that he was hampered in his attempt of emancipation toward a purer idealism by many side issues; his Axel (1890o) is a prose poem in dramatic form, a bewildering mixture of all sorts of new literary fads, which leave behind only one clear impression, namely, the longing to be free by any means-be these child- ish, or primitive, or naive-from the nightmare of realism. Not so with Bourget, who in 1888 published his powerful Disciple: the story of the young philosopher who applied the theories of the master (Taine) that there exists no good and bad, but just causes and effects follow- ing unalterable scientific laws. The dis- ciple makes a psychological experiment on a poor, innocent girl, who falls his victim. After the tragedy, the disciple, then the master, understands; before the sorrow of the mother of his vic- tim the "philosopher" mutters a Lord's Prayer. All novels of Bourget following this one are just steps which lead him nearer and nearer to the orthodox Catholic dogma, viz., that the most profound, the most sublime, the loftiest, philosophy is that of the solidarity of all men, in which expiation by the just for the unjust is no longer shocking, but very beautiful (Le Demon de midi was pub- lished on the eve of the war, 1914). Other novels which are landmarks showing the keener interest of the French</page><page sequence="13">THE RELIGIOUS AWAKENING OF FRANCE 79 for religious problems were: in 1902, Marcel Tinayre's Maison du pich--with no conclusion whatsoever, but a tragic statement of the conflict in man's con- science between the right to worldly happiness and the duty to conquer one's self; in 1909, Andre Gide's Porte &amp;troite-- with no conclusion either, but with mi- nute descriptions of souls tormented with their thirst for ideals and perhaps miss- ing the goal because of their endless, ethico-theological casuistry. Novels which turn out to be mostly theological or philosophical treatises are not unusual in these years: Romain Rolland's ten-volume novel--Jean- Christophe-is only a long soliloquy of a man not satisfied with the past and aspiring to a loftier life. Huysmans leaves his frantic realism of the seventies for symbolistic novels in A-Rebours (1884), esoteric in LA-bas (i89i), and aesthetico-catholic in En Route (I893- 95), La Cathidrale (1898) and L'Oblat (1903). Maeterlinck keeps on feeling the pulse of his fellow-men, and as early as 1893 he offers his translation of the mystic Ruysbroek; then he publishes successively Trisor des humbles (1896), Sagesse et destinde (1898), Temple enseveli (1902)-everlasting litanies on the new idealism, which are taken up with re- newed eagerness by the public each time. Trisor des humbles contains these words in a chapter on "The Awakening of the Soul": "Today, the soul is clearly mak- ing a mighty effort. Its manifestations are everywhere ..... Magnetism, te- lepathy, levitation, the unsuspected properties of radiating matter, and countless other phenomena are battering down the door of orthodox science .... Let us wait in silence; perhaps ere long we shall be conscious of the presence of the Gods!" Since this passage was written, in I896, indeed the "murmur of the Gods" has grown louder and louder. And, at last, in 1913 it was no longer a murmur, but almost a song of triumph. Early that year a book was published which crystallized in the happiest fashion all the slow but persistent thinking of the two last decades. It was the book so many seemed to be expecting who were still in the dark about their own mind; and at once they recognized what they had been waiting for. The writer has given elsewhere' some details on this striking volume. Suffice it to say here once more that the author, Bertrand, has done away for good with the haughty attitude of the scholar, which had been in fashion so long, toward religious dis- cussions. It is with the most sympa- thetic curiosity that Bertrand bends over his St. Augustin-a sympathy so true that he cannot help seeing in that man, who had been tormented in his soul for so many years and who had finally found truth, another self: "That life of Augus- tin and the age that witnessed it reminds us of our own age and of ourselves. The recurrence of similar circumstances has brought about the recurrence of charac- ters of a similar nature. It is almost our portrait. We are near concluding that at the present hour there is no more timely topic than St. Augustin." In the same article several other facts are stated to show how quickly things moved in recent years. Moreover, F. Jammes, the poet of the Giorgiques Chrntiennes; P. Claudel, the inspired author of ' American Journal of Psychology (June, 1916), pp. 3o01-5.</page><page sequence="14">80 THE BIBLICAL WORLD L'Annonciation faite d Marie; the ardent P~guy of the Myst&amp;re de Jeanne d'Arc; the mystic Capitaine Psichari, of the Veillhe du centurion, are beginning to be better known. The only thing to add here, then, is that the logical outcome of this whole movement is found in a book not long out, Maurice Barris' Les diverses familles spirituelles de la France. It is one of the most moving publications of the war. The point which Barris is endeavoring to make is this: While the spirit of tolerance has achieved miracles among the soldiers, causing them all to act as brethren in spite of the greatest differences in philosophical or religious opinions, at the same time the individual dogmatic convictions have been deepened and strengthened by the experiences of the war. The "familles spirituelles" are the Catholics, the Protestants, the Jews, the Traditionalists (return to the old national and perhaps royalistic traditions), the Socialists. Tolerance before the war meant too often indif- ference; this is no longer so; the men, during these months of hardships, have collected their thoughts, have examined with interest the religious creeds of their youth, have learned to cherish them; and, as they came to love their own, they have come to understand how the others must be fond of theirs as well. More- over, Barris asks us to be careful and not confuse this with the sort of artificial tolerance produced by the exaltation of the first days of the war; as this initial emotion subsided, tolerance did not go with it; or rather this first tolerance was replaced by one of a more substantial nature; for the "great wave of enthusi- asm" had gone when Barris collected his information, and his present testimonialis supported by "millions of sublime letters, which after two years provide France with its spiritual bread." Abundant ex- tracts from these letters are reproduced.' 'Several volumes could be mentioned here, illustrating Barris' contention. Let us name only two: L'abb&amp; Chevoleau, caporal au gome d'infanterie, by Emile Baumann (Paris, 1917), and Roger Allier [the son of the famous protestant professor in Paris], sous-lieutenant au I1i Chasseurs Alpins, In Memoriam, published for his family and friends (Paris, 1917). Why not add H. Massis's Le Sacrifice, which is almost fanatically Catholic (Paris, 1917)?</page></plain_text>
