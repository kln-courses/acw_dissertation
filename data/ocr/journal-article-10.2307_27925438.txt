<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Sign of Tanit from Tel 'Akko M.DOTHAN University of Haifa In August and September 1973, the first season of excavations took place at Tel 'Akko (Tell el-Fukhkhar), the site identified with ancient 'Akko.1 The first season has yielded extensive evidence of the Phoenician culture. Especially interesting in this connection is the discovery of the sign of Tanit, stamped on a sherd of a large pottery vessel (Fig. 1, PI. 9:A).2 This seems to be the first such occurrence in the east Mediterranean area. Fig. 1. Sherd of large pottery vessel bearing sign of Tanit (scale 1 : 2). There are two main schools of thought among scholars regarding the origin of the cult and the symbols of Tanit. One school maintains that the cult is of eastern origin, while the other treats it as indigenous to the Punic pantheon, possibly even of Libyan origin.3 It is not my intention to discuss here this extremely complicated matter, but rather to add yet another link to the chain of occurrences of this sign along the Phoenician coast and to outline the possible implications of this find for the question of the origin of the cult of Tanit. The sherd (Reg. No. A/187/1) was found in the upper part of the acropolis (Area A), in the second (Hellenistic) stratum. This stratum existed through the entire second 1 IEJ 23 (1973), pp. 257-258. 2 P. Cintas lately refrains from identifying this symbol as the 'sign of Tanit\ It seems, however, that the occurrence of Tank's appellative Phanebalos and of her figure with this sign, besides on coins of Ascalon, is a decisive argument for this identification (see below, n. 3). 3 For these schools of thought and an additional idea about the Egyptian origin of the sign through the 'ankh sign see: G.Ch.

Its end is dated by the latest pottery types, stamped Rhodian jar handles and coins, to the end of the second, and perhaps the beginning of the first century b.c. It must be stressed, however, that this stratum, which was uncovered almost directly below the surface, had been greatly disturbed, and contains many intrusive sherds of earlier periods, in addition to the largely homogeneous Hellenistic material. The sherd, broken off in antiquity, probably belonged to the lower part of an amphora. Only about two-thirds of the stamp are preserved. The ware is pinkish on the inside, yellowish on the outside and light brown in section. Similar ceramic material is usually associated with thp late Persian or Hellenistic periods. The stamp is impressed diagonally to the right in relation to the wheel marks of the vessel, and the sign is in the centre of the circular stamp, which has a diameter of 20 mm. The head of the figure is round at the top, and somewhat more oblong at the bottom. It is separated from the trapezoidal body by the outstretched arms and raised forearms. In the centre of the body is an object which is difficult to identify, consisting of an almost semi-circular base, from the centre of which rises a vertical stem, crowned by a circle above a crescent-shaped section. This may be a schematic representation of a thymiaterion, or possibly an anchor.4 A wide line is incised parallel to the wheel marks and touching the stamp impression; it was probably accidentally made during the production of the vessel. The symbol of Tanit is well known in the Punic world, possibly from the fifth century, but certainly from the fourth century b.c. onwards.5 Until now it has been found mainly on funerary or votive stone stelae, but also on other objects, including seals, amulets, boxes, etc.6 On pottery vessels, however, the Tanit sign seems to be rare. It occurs, for example, on a terracotta tub from the Hellenistic period, found at the Punic site of Solonto in Sicily, and on a lamp and a clay box from Carthage.7 But there are only a few examples known on handles of Punic pottery vessels. Among the different variations of the symbol of Tanit, the closest parallel to the 'Akko stamp appears as type in the collections of the Mus?e Alaoui.8 This sign is a schematic figure with a trapezoidal body; the head is circular on top, with the oblong lower part separated from the body by outstretched arms and raised forearms. Type appears mainly on stone stelae from the fourth?third centuries b.c., though 4 H. Seyrig: Bulletin du Mus?e de Beyrouth 8 (1946-48), pp. 37-48, 52-64, Pis. i, m. 5 Cf. e.g. G.

The closest parallel to the 'Akko stamp, among the rare examples of the sign of Tanit stamped on ceramic material, is a handle found at Lilibeo in Sicily.9 It differs from our example in the oblong form of the stamp; therefore the arms of the figure rise directly from its shoulders. Bisi suggests that the object in the centre of the body is a bethyl on an upturned base; however, it could well be a thymiaterion of the type shown, for example, on a well-known stele, also from Lilibeo.10 The handle belongs to the period of Punic rule in Sicily, and is dated from 300-280 b.c. Until recently the number of recorded discoveries of the sign of Tanit, or references to the goddess on the Phoenician coast, was small in comparison to the number of such occurrences in the West. Among the few sporadic discoveries of the sign were the tomb reliefs found in the neighbourhood of Tyre at el-Biyad and Hanawe,11 the in scription mentioning 'BDTN(Y) in the cave at Wasta between Tyre and Sidon,12 lead weights from Oumm el-'Amed13 and a lead weight from Ashdod Yam.14 To this list should be added a coin of Ascalon struck under Hadrian, bearing the sign of Tanit and the name a ?a , and what is probably the image of Tanit,15 and a recently identified lead weight from Beirut, now at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.16 In addition, two lead weights stamped with the sign of Tanit were found recently in Lebanon, in the shop of an antiquities dealer.17 Since 1970 the number of finds bearing the sign of Tanit have increased, due largely to the excavations carried out both on land and under the sea along the coast of Lebanon and Israel. The first of these finds was a stamped glass fragment from Sarepta (biblical Zarephat).18 This was followed by the discovery in 1971-2 of hund 9 Anna Mar?a Bisi, Atti della Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Notizie degli Scavi di Antichit? 25 (1971), p. 735, Figs. 8g, 73. 10 CIS, , Part , Pl. xxrx, No. 138; Anna Maria Bisi, Sicilia Archeologica 2 (1968), Fig. 11. 11 C.

In light of these recent discoveries, it would seem that the Tanit sign is well represented on the Phoenician coast, appearing in various media, thus precluding the possibility that the 'Akko stamp might be only a chance occurrence. The relatively frequent appearance of the Tanit sign along the Phoenician coast may thus serve as partial evidence for the existence of a Tanit cult in this area over a period of several centuries. The question then is whether the appearance of the sign was the result of extensive cultural ties with the western Phoenician colonies, where the cult originated and became widespread, or whether the Tanit tradition originated on the Phoenician coast and later spread to the west. One of the strong supporters of the theory that the Tanit sign originated in Phoe nicia was the late M. Dunand. He believed that the sign began as the representation of an anchor, the symbol of Tyre, and later developed its anthropomorphic form at Carthage.20 He was convinced that the small number of examples of the sign on the Lebanese-Israeli coast, none of them early, showed clearly the eastern antecedent of the anthropomorphic form of the west. The growing number of discoveries of the sign on the Phoenician coast, however, may indicate the priority of the idea here, or at least its parallel development in both Phoenicia and the western colonies. At a later stage, this development may have become a reciprocal process, which probably received support from the visits of the colonists to their old country. Such a process is clearly evidenced by the numerous Tanit figurines found off the Phoenician coast at Shave Zion (and probably also at Tyre). Figurines in the round such as these are rare in Punic art outside of Spain,21 and nowhere in the Punic world has such a large group of figurines been discovered. Thus, the Shavei Zion group, associated with fifth?fourth centuries b.c. pottery vessels, is the decisive evidence for east-west links. Either this group was sent from the west for Phoenician use, or else these figurines were manufactured in the east for export to the west. In either case, the cult of Tanit would have been well known on the Phoenician coast. The early form of the sign on the Shave Zion figurines, consisting simply of a circle and triangle separated by a horizontal bar, should also be noted. In this context, the 'BD TNT inscription in dicates the religious attachments of the Phoenicians, even those living in the Greek diaspora at the end of the fifth century.22 On the basis of the appearance of the Tanit sign in a mosaic from the Hellenistic period at Delos, and its appearance there also on Hellenistic pottery lamps, one may even conclude that such affiliation continued 19 North of 'Akko. See E. Linder, Archaeology 26 (1973), pp. 182 ff. There are well-founded rumours about similar figurines with the sign of Tanit found lately in the port of Tyre. 20 M. Dunand, loc. cit.

In the same way the cult of Baal Hamon (Baal Shamem), one of the many gods of the Phoenician pantheon, became the chief cult of the colonies. In conclusion, some of the relevant linguistic and epigraphic material which com prises evidence for the eastern origin of the name and cult of Tanit should be men tioned. It is well known that the pronunciation Tanit is deliberate, the only known transcription being Tinnii or Tennit ( , E E ).24 1948, Albright noted the occurrences of the word TNT in a Proto-Sinaitic inscription (347) dedicated to Ba'alat, and at that time translated it as 'gift' or 'offering'.25 Later, however, he re tracted his former explanation of TNT in Proto-Sinaitic as an infinitive construct of the word 'to give', and agreed with the above-mentioned pronunciation tennit, fol lowing the Greek inscription found in the Punic sanctuary of El Hofra.2^ Albright also viewed favorably the identification of Tanit with Anat, the main reason being that the supposed original designation Pane-Ba'al ]D of the Punic inscrip tions) was used for both Tanit and Anat.27 The word Tennit stems from Tamnit (= tabnit), 'image' (cf. Num. 12:8), appearing in Phoenician names as Tbnt, 'which is translated into Greek as Tennes (probably from Tennit)'.28 Yadin suggests con nections between Tanit and the Proto-Sinaitic word TNT In his opinion, this name derived from a root signifying a specific lot, similar to the name Manawat, the consort of Ba'al Hamon. The semantic parallel between nin and rvttfc (both are similar toTyche) is supported by the use of the word nan, in the meaning of a defined gift-portion, in a Nabatean document from Nahal Hever.29 Cross, however, who dedicated important research to this subject and who suggested the reading TNT = tannit in the Proto-Sinaitic inscription, maintains that it meant 'the one of the (sea) serpent' or the 'Dragon Lady' who is identical with the Carthaginian goddess Tanit.30 According to Cross, it seems that the name Tanit (identified by him with Asherah) 23 P.

The sign of Tanit with her designation Pane-Ba'al, appearing on the second century a.D. coins at Ascalon, bears witness to the vitality and perseverance of the cult of the goddess and her sign, even at such a late period. From the Phoenician-Canaanite coast, the cult of the goddess (?paVa Dsn)32 appears to have spread to the western colonies. Whether Tanit acquired her specific sign only there, or whether it originated elsewhere, is still un clear. But the recent discoveries of this sign and her figurines on this coast, constitute important new evidence for the cultural ties between the Phoenician settlements of the west and the lands of their origin. 31 For the identification of Tanit with Asherah see also G. Garbini: Oriens Antiquus 1 (1962), pp. 297 ff. S. Moscati: The World of the Phoenicians, London, 1968, pp. 137 if. 32 Much speculation has arisen from the inscription found at Carthage mentioning 'Tanit in Lebanon'. With the growing number of appearances of Tanit on the Phoenician coast the explanation of this inscription as dealing with the goddess and not with the 'white rocks' on which the temples of Carthage were built (as suggested, for example, by Preisendanz, PWRE, iv, col. 2210 and Donner &amp; R?Tlig, op. cit. [above, . 3], No. 81, pp. 98 ff.) should be reconsidered.
