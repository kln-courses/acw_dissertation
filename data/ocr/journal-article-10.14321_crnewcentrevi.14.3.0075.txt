But if, without liking literature in general and for its own sake, I like something about it, which above all cannot be reduced to some aesthetic quality, to some source of formal pleasure [jouissance], this would be in place of the secret. In place of an absolute secret. There would be the passion. There is no passion without secret, this very secret, indeed no secret without this passion. —Jacques Derrida1 I . L I T E R A R Y M I S U N D E R S T A N D I N G In his invitation to contribute to this special issue, David Johnson makes reference to John Beverley’s provocative new book Latinamericanism After 9/11; in particular, he cites the conclusion of the chapter that diagnoses a “neoconservative turn” in Latin American literary and cultural studies, in CR: The New Centennial Review, Vol. 14, No. 3, 2014, pp. 75–92.

Like Johnson, I too felt a certain interpellation in Beverley’s words when I first read the book, even as I wondered about the relation of equivalence established between “Borges” and “literature,” and “literature” and “us.”Who, orwhat, is Borges?What is literature?Whoarewe? What, exactly, do we do? In what way are these productive questions, and to what extent do they reinforce the identitary logic that underscores Beverley’s argument (aswell as, Imight add,muchof thework of LatinAmerican literary and cultural studies)? What if, instead of trying to identify Borges, literature, and ourselves, or ourwork, wewere to turn our attention elsewhere, upon the places where those identities (and projects) fail, or prove impossible? In that sense, I would rather read Beverley’s statement (which, like Louis Althusser’s allegorical example of ideological interpellation, is also an accusation, an indictment) as an interpellative statement that produces a failed subject, that mis-recognizes Borges, literature, us. The question then becomes, for me, can literature (or literary discourse) allowus to better articulate such failures or, if not, can literary discourse bear witness to the impossibility of such an articu- lation? Is “literature” misunderstood or, on the contrary, can literary dis- course create the conditions of possibility for a theory of misunderstanding, indeed, ofmisunderstanding as the constitutive quality of literature itself?My argument, then, is not that Beverley is “wrong” about literature (although I think thathe is), but thatweare all “wrong” about literature—insofar as literature itself iswrong, albeit awrong that isnotdefinedbya relation toa “right”—and that it is precisely this “wrong” that should fuel our conversations as critics. To take up the question of misunderstanding, I turn to a 2003 essay by Jacques Rancière, “Le malentendu littéraire,” in which the philosopher asks whether literature has a particular relationship with misunderstanding as a form.2 He opens the essay by engaging in a close reading of the Trésor de la langue française dictionary’s entry for “misunderstanding,” which gives two possible definitions: “a divergence of interpretation regarding themeaning of words or acts leading to disagreement” and “a disagreement brought about by such a divergence” (2011, 31), both of which imply an elusive yet proper inter- pretation of words, the deviation from or quarrel over which leads to prob- </page> <page sequence="3"> E r i n G r a f f Z i v i n   7 7 lems.3 Yet the very same entry betrays an internal contradictionwhen it turns to literary examples to illustrate the definition. “Inevitably,” he quotesMartin du Gard as having written, “at the bottom of all passionate love, there is a misunderstanding, a generous illusion, an error of judgment, a false idea each has of the other,” while inZolawefind the affirmation that “Their disharmony only grew, aggravated by one of those peculiarmisunderstandings of the flesh that chill the most ardent heart: he adored his wife, she had all the sensuality of a sensuous blonde, yet already they were sleeping apart, ill at ease, easily hurt” (32). Rather than corroborating the definition (of misunderstanding, but alsoofwords, of acts, of signification), thepassages endup subverting it by exposing the gap at the heart of love, themisunderstanding that resides at the core of language itself, “a non-relationship constitutive of the very faculty of producing and interpreting signs” (33). Rancière’s essay then traces a genealogy of literature as misunderstand- ing, turning to Sartre’s What is Literature?, in which the philosopher claims that writers, after 1848, “don’t want to be understood,” refusing “to serve the ends the bourgeois public assigns to literature” (33). Yet this too is a misun- derstanding, amisunderstanding of literature and ofmisunderstanding itself: “misunderstanding . . . is fictitious,” Rancière claims, “it is the fiction that seals the tacit contract between the literary elite and thedominant class at the expense of . . . the people” (34). Among the reasons why such a relationship is fictitious or impossible, is the problematic assumption that “the elite agree on what they are doing” (34). On the contrary, it is disagreement that character- izes the political, and which stands as the correlative of literary misunder- standing. The idea ofmalentendu littéraire, then, bears a formal compatibility to mésentente politique: “This is the ground on which political disagreement arises. It is also the groundonwhichwe can theorize the relationship between politics and literature, betweenpolitical disagreement and literary ‘misunder- standing’” (41).4 Despite the structural affinity, however, politics and litera- ture do very different things, particularly in relation to the concepts of partage (partition or distribution) and counting: political disagreement and literary misunderstanding each attack one aspect of [the] consensual paradigm of proportion between words and things. Dis- </page> <page sequence="4"> 7 8   M a r r a n o S e c r e t s ; O r , M i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g L i t e r a t u r e agreement invents names, utterances, arguments and demonstrations that set up new collectives where anyone can get themselves counted in the count of the uncounted. Misunderstanding works on the relationship and the count from another angle, by suspending the forms of individuality through which consensual logic binds bodies to meanings. Politics works on the whole, liter- ature works on the units. (41)5 Both the political and the literary challenge the idea of “what counts” by introducing a language (and for Rancière language resides at the core of each) that would derail any count deemed to be total, whole. Yet they do so in radically different ways, so much so that literary misunderstanding “tends to steer away from serving political misunderstanding,” which is why Rancière opts to speak about the metapolitics of literature, rather than the politics of literature (or “content-based commitment”).6 At the same time, literary mis- understanding—or literature asmisunderstanding—might act as a condition of possibility (although certainly not the only condition of possibility) for a radical rethinking of the political alongRancièrian lines. That is, while literary languagemight not “serve” politics in an explicitly ideological or strategicway (as the bearer of a translatablemessage or position, as ameans to a particular end), misunderstanding literature, or reading the misunderstanding quality that is constitutive of the literary, might call our attention to the misunder- standing that resides at the heart of the political—at least of a notion of the political that poses a radical demand grounded in dissensus (rather than, for example, Rancière’s idea of “police” which, in contrast to politics, would merely preserve the status quo). Inwhat follows, Iwant topropose amodeof reading thatwould expose the misunderstanding that is constitutive of both the literary and the political. By this I do notmean an exposure that would seek to remedy, resolve or clear up such a misunderstanding. Such a definition of misunderstanding is precisely what Rancière aims to debunk in his work. Rather than appealing to what Rancière describes as a common fantasy of “a form of communication that would be devoid of misunderstandings” (2011, 2, my italics), I am interested in a critical praxis that would point to the gaps in processes of signification and subjectivation, whether these gaps are understood as misrecognition (Judith </page> <page sequence="5"> E r i n G r a f f Z i v i n   7 9 Butler’s take on Althusser), the posthegemonic (Jon Beasley-Murray’s take on Ernesto Laclau), among others. Responding to a conventional misreading of literature (the conflation of “literature” as a historically—and geographically— specific institution with “the literary,” or that which would exceed such an institution),7 I want to introduce the idea of themarrano secret as a logic that would subvert what I call elsewhere “Inquisitional logic,” or identitarian thinking (the “is” in “Borges is literature,” in “literature is what we do”).8 If in my broader work I examine concrete representations of the figure of the marrano in literature, here I will take this figure “figuratively,” dwelling upon the idea of the marrano-as-metonym, the notion of a universal marrano subject that bearswitnessnot to a secret that he keeps, but rather to the secret that keeps him: a subject, in short, that refuses a logic of revelation, self- reflexivity, intelligibility. In the final part of this essay, I will turn to an under- studied scene from Juan José Saer’s 1983 novel El entenado to consider a literary practice that performatively and constatively addresses the idea of misunderstanding and, in doing so, bears witness to the subject’s failure to understand, indeed, to the idea of misunderstanding as constitutive of what we might call the marrano subject. I I . M A R R A N O S E C R E T S What is the relationship between the secret, or the marrano secret, and misunderstanding, or literary misunderstanding? Is it possible to trace a formal link between the marrano secret, literary misunderstanding, and dis- agreement or dissensus, beyond any thematic compatibility? I want to begin by considering the marrano as an early modern figure that Argentine philos- opher Ricardo Forster has described as the alter-ego of the nascent modern subject: Leer al marrano, en parte, significa leer la incompletitud del hombre en la modernidad, o comenzar a comprender la imposibilidad de esa estrategia colosalmontada por el cartesianismo, que supuso proyectar un sujeto autosu- ficiente, en términos racionales, capaz de ordenar, en términos de completitud, su lugar en el mundo. Mientras que, en el caso del marrano, nos encontramos </page> <page sequence="6"> 8 0   M a r r a n o S e c r e t s ; O r , M i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g L i t e r a t u r e desde el comienzo con la falla, con la grieta, con el lado oscuro, con la incompletitud. [To read themarrano, in part, implies a reading of the incompleteness of man within modernity, a beginning to understand the impossibility of the colossal strategy mounted by Cartesianism, which aimed to project a self-sufficient subject, in rational terms, capable of ordering, in terms of completeness, his place in the world. Meanwhile, in the case of the marrano, we are confronted from the beginning with a flaw, a fissure, a dark side: with incompleteness.] (2005, 155) The fractured, incomplete marrano does not offer an “alternative” to the Cartesian subject’s wholeness or autonomy, but rather exposes “la imposibi- lidad de toda identidad,” the impossibility of all identity. (156, my italics) The faultline, void, or gap that traverses the marrano alludes to her constitutive guilt: the marrano is always already a subject-at-fault, a flawed, or failed, subject. For Forster, the marrano’s significance lies in the exposure of this faultline, of themistaken or faulty quality of themodern autonomous subject. Alberto Moreiras, for his part, has written of the melancholia of the mar- rano: if he reads the converso, or Jewish convert to Christianity, as a reference to “the abandonment of what was previously one’s own in order to embrace a social truth, a dominant state of the situation,” the marrano, according to Moreiras, “is the state of return, or rather the melancholy state where the shadow of the lost object falls upon the subject and splits it or destabilizes it” (2012, 175–76). Derrida, finally, linksmarranismo to absolute secrecy, locating “in themetonymic and generalized figure of theMarrano, the right to secrecy as right to resistance against and beyond the order of the political” (2002, 64). Each of these thinkers emphasizes, over and above the historical-material specificity of marranismo, a logic that resists the dominant logic (of the state, of empire, of the sovereign subject): to borrow from Moreiras, the marrano serves as “apoint of torsionof ahistoryof thepracticeof freedomthat, as such, has never relented in its struggle against the logics of imperial domination” (2012, 176). </page> <page sequence="7"> E r i n G r a f f Z i v i n   8 1 Yet representations of themarrano (beginning in the fourteenth century) betray a tension, an ambivalence, between two very different conceptions of marranismo, which correspond to two competing logics of the idea of the secret, or of truth itself. In the first version, the marrano embodies a hidden truth: she is either a faithful Christian or a clandestine Jew, the truth of which can only be determined through the pain of torture and Inquisitional interro- gation. Such a use for torture within the early modern world draws upon the ancient Athenian practice, which Greek scholar Page duBois has linked to classical Athenian conceptions of truth, specifically, the idea of alêtheia as a buried truth brought to light, as unconcealment (in contrast to nêmertes, the unfailing, accurate truth of the underworld). A second interpretation of mar- ranismo would move away from the idea of the secret as positive content in favor of a notion of secrecy that would resist the logic of alêtheia, as Derrida has argued in “Passions: An Oblique Offering”: Heterogeneoustothehidden,totheobscure, tothenocturnal, totheinvisible, towhat canbedissimulatedandindeedtowhatisnonmanifest ingeneral, [thesecret]cannot beunveiled. It remains inviolableevenwhenonethinksonehasrevealedit.Notthat it hides itself forever in an indecipherable crypt or behind an absolute veil. It simply exceedstheplayofveiling/unveiling,dissimulation/revelation,night/day, forgetting/ anamnesis, earth/heaven, etc. It doesnotbelong therefore to the truth. (1995, 26) Inquisitorialwrathagainst themarrano, Ihaveclaimedinpreviouswork, is fueled byanxiety surrounding theambivalencebetween these competingnotionsof the secret: while the ostensible objective of Inquisitorial interrogation is the rooting out of heresy, the confession of hidden truth, the extraction of identifiable guilt, the impossibilityof suchextractioncreates furtherdisquiet,which in turn inspires more torture. Literary representations ofmarranismo exhibit a similar undecid- ability, oscillating between the reproduction and deconstruction of Inquisitional logic, between a version of the marrano as guardian of a revealable (or conceal- able) secret, and a version of themarrano that hides nothingmore than the fact that there is nothing tohide. In this sense, literature doesnot standas auniversal privileged site of either understanding or misunderstanding (it can be either or both)—yet literary discourse can offer the condition of possibility for the decon- </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 2   M a r r a n o S e c r e t s ; O r , M i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g L i t e r a t u r e struction of alêtheia and identity, even when this may only come about through the act of reading.9 Inwhat follows, I turn to Saer’s El entenado (translated into English as The Witness) to consider misunderstanding as both trope and performative utterance, asking what the literary might have to tell us about subjectivity, truth, or the failure of both. I I I . E Q U I V O C A L S U B J E C T I V I T Y El entenado, a fictionalized account of the arrival of Juan Díaz de Solís and his crew to the Río de la Plata in 1516, is narrated from the perspective of an orphan, or bastard (entenado) who has accompanied the crew as cabin boy. He is taken captive by the Colastiné Indians, with whomhe lives for ten years, bearing witness to, among other things, the killing and eating of his crew- mates.10Thenovelhasbeenreadbyliteraryscholarsasametafictionalaccountof the Spanish arrival to the NewWorld (de Grandis), as a rewriting of the colonial relación or crónica (Gnutzmann, Romano Thuesen), as a theorization of the impotence of language (Miller), as a decentering of the subject of the conquest (Copertari), as “speculative anthropology” (Riera), as an ethical response to the call of the other (Legrás), as a deconstruction of cannibalism (González) and, finally, as a register of the crisis of literature in the wake of dictatorship and transition to neoliberalism (Gollnick). While a majority of the criticism dwells upon the ten years the protagonist and narrator spends living among the Colas- tiné, as well as the ensuing decades after his return to Spain, at the end of which timehe sits down to compose the story as anoldman—that is, whilemost critics areconcernedprimarilywith thecolonial (proto-ethnographic) “encounter”with the other and the related problem of representation—I want to turn to a prior moment, a relatively understudied scene that is narrated in the opening pages of the short novel, and which concerns itself not with the question of the other but with the problemof the subject. After having spent several months at sea, during which time boredom, heat, sexual desperation, and madness begin to overtake the claustrophobic crew (a period that is represented in a few short pages of the novel), the three ships finally catch sight of dry land, at which time some of the sailors dive into the sea even before they dock, otherswait until reaching shore to run onto the </page> <page sequence="9"> E r i n G r a f f Z i v i n   8 3 sand and jump up and down in place or jog in circles, others joyfully urinate into the ocean, while still others opt to remain onboard, observing this new land from a safe distance. They spend the first evening singing, farting and laughing around a campfire and, the next day, come to realize that they have reached an unknown place, rather than their expected destination of the Indies, at which point, the crew begins to argue among themselves over whether to stay or continue to the south. Their shouting is interrupted by the appearance of the captain, whose disembarkment provokes fear, awe, and respect in the contentious crew as they await what they imagine must be an official speech claiming the new land. The speech never comes, however, and the narrator relates the surprise and horror of that which takes its place: La expectativa aunaba a los marinos, inmovilizados por la misma estupefac- ción solidaria. Por fin, después de esos minutos de espera casi insoportable, ocurrió algo: el capitán, dándonos todavía la espalda, emitió un suspiro ru- idoso, profundo yprolongado, que resonónítido en lamañana silenciosa y que estremeció un poco su cuerpo tieso y macizo. Han pasado, más o menos, sesenta años desde aquella mañana y puedo decir, sin exagerar en lo más mínimo, que el carácter único de ese suspiro, en cuanto a la profundidad y duración se refiere, ha dejado en mí una impresión definitiva, que me acom- pañará hasta la muerte. En la expresión de los marinos, ese suspiro, por otra parte, borró la estupefacción para dar paso a un principio de pánico. El más inconcebible de losmonstruosde esa tierradesconocidahubiese sido recibido con menor conmoción que esa expiración melancólica. (Saer 1983, 20–21) [Expectation united the sailors who stood immobilized by the same shared sense of stupefaction. At last, after the almost unbearable waiting, something happened: the captain, still with his back turned to us, let out a long, deep, heartfelt sigh that could be clearly heard in the silent morning and that sent a slight tremor through his solid, upright frame. Some sixty years have passed since thatmorning yet I can saywithout the slightest exaggeration that some- thing about the depth of that long-drawn-out sigh so impressedme that it will remain withme till I die. The effect on the sailors, however, was to replace the look of amazement on their faces with the beginnings of panic. The most </page> <page sequence="10"> 8 4   M a r r a n o S e c r e t s ; O r , M i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g L i t e r a t u r e incredible of monsters inhabiting that unknown land would have been greeted with less horror than that melancholic sigh.] (Saer 2009, 19) “Something happened”—“ocurrió algo”—but what? The mystery of what ex- perience, thought, emotion, has provoked the sigh—and the subsequent reac- tion of dread displayed by its witnesses—is left unsaid here. As he does in a number of the most dramatic scenes of El entenado, Saer inserts the voice of the narrator, writingmore than a half-century after this unforgettable day on the beach, so that the captain’s sigh is not only observed by the panicked sailors, but also recalled six decades later, and then witnessed a third time by the reader, who is only implied here through the narrator’s address. It is not until several pages after the “event” that founds the novel, or that which has triggered the event—the “ocurrió algo”—that the reader is offered a theory of what might have provoked such terror. El capitán parecía despavorido—si se puede hablar de pavor en el caso de una verificación intolerable de la que sin embargo elmiedo está ausente. Las pocas palabras que pronunciaba le salían con una voz quebrada, débil, cercana al llanto. Y el sudor que le atravesaba la frente y las mejillas y que se perdía en el matorral negro de la barba, le dejaba alrededor de los ojos estelas húmedas y sucias que evocaban espontáneamente las lágrimas. Ahora que soy un viejo, que han pasado tantos años desde aquella mañana luminosa, creo entender que los sentimientos del capitán en ese trance de inminencia provenían de la comprobación de un error de apreciación que había venido cometiendo, a lo largo de toda su vida, acerca de su propia condición. En la mañana vacía, su propio ser se desnudaba, como el ser de la liebre ha de desnudarse, sin duda, para su propia comprensión diminuta, cuando se topa, en algún rincón del campo, con la trampa del cazador. (Saer 1983, 25–26) [The captain seemedutterly terrified—if one canuse thatword to describe the state of mind of aman possessed of unbearable knowledge fromwhich never- theless all fear is absent. The fewwords he uttered cameout in aweak, broken, almost grief-stricken voice; the sweat running down his forehead and cheeks into the dense black scrub of his beard left damp,muddy trails aroundhis eyes </page> <page sequence="11"> E r i n G r a f f Z i v i n   8 5 that immediatelymadeone thinkof tears. Now that I amanoldmanandmany years have passed since that shining morning, I can begin to understand that what lay behind the captain’s feelings in that precisemoment was the realiza- tion that all his life he hadbeenmistaken about the kind ofmanhewas. In that empty morning, his very being was laid bare as no doubt (within the capabil- ities of its limited understanding) is the soul of the hare when in the corner of some field it encounters the hunter’s trap.] (Saer 2009, 24–25) In this passage, the perspiration, tears, and trance of the captain are described as stemming from the apprehension of a terrible fact that has quite literally brokenhis voice, interruptingormaking impossible thediscourse of conquest anticipated by the sailors.11 The narrator signals an aporia at the heart of this knowledge by employing discourse that lies somewhere between the literary and the legal or scientific, between the language of testimony and the lan- guage of proof. “La comprobación de un error”—the proof of an error—on the one hand evokes a legal or scientific logic in its ostensible allusion to a provable truth. Yet no such truth ever enters the narrative: there is no nar- rated identity said to have been shattered by the event. Rather, the rhetoric is conditioned by the experience of radical exposure (which, in turn, conditions all rhetoric, according to Moreiras).12 It is the laying bare of the captain’s being, metaphorically linked to the hare that encounters the hunter’s trap, that has most jolted the captain and, by extension, the onlookers. But this is not an exposure to an anthropomorphic other, not to the “other” of theWest (whowill shortly appear) but to the heteronomous, equivocal condition of the subject itself. The experience of exposure, or shattering, eclipses any possible “firmness” of either new world or old, which ultimately escapes narration in Saer. The traumatic moment is not narrated in the chronological or causal mode that often dominates such readings: there is no before and after, the event has always already happened, the exposure merely represents the mo- ment in which it becomes clear that what resides at the core of the captain, laid bare before an equally barren land, is nothing more than an error. Or rather: the realization by the captain that he has been wrong about himself does not so much replace a previously whole subject with a new, broken subject, but rather claims that the subjectwas broken, fractured, equivocal, to </page> <page sequence="12"> 8 6   M a r r a n o S e c r e t s ; O r , M i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g L i t e r a t u r e begin with. At the same time, this epiphanic moment departs from the literary-religious tradition of epiphany in its refusal to name that which came before, or thatwhich shall follow.This is not anepiphany thatunveils ahidden or forgotten “truth” (anamnesis), but rather the exposure of a constitutive error, the affirmation of a terrible secret: the secret that it is misunderstand- ing or equivocation that founds the subject, a “proof” that the captain has been “disproven” that resists the logic of proof altogether. Almost immediately following this scene, the captain is shot by arrows and killed in the very place in which his being is laid bare. In fact, all of this happens before the “real” action evenbegins: before thedramatic kidnappingof thenarra- tor, before his decade of captivity, before his witnessing of the annual orgy of incest, anthropophagy, and disorder that nearly unravels and at the very same time constitutes the community in which he is living, before—perhaps most significantly—his return to Spain to be “adopted” once again, this time by Father Quesada, travelwithapopular theatrical troupeand,finally, at theendofhisdays, sit down to compose the story that we are reading. So why is this early scene significant, whatwork does it do for the narrative that follows? First of all, the fact that this traumatic scene stands as one of the first scenes of the novel allows for the event to interrupt something that neverthe- less remains outside the narrative. Just as the protagonist’s attempt to recall the eventsof his tenyears in theRíode laPlata repeatedly calls attention to the impossibility of representing the Colastiné tribe, their language, the past, experience itself, the past before the past—themoment which would ostensi- bly signify a status quo about to be disrupted, a situation before-the-event, also remains elusive, outside the scope of this narrative as well as the order of representation.At the same time, the cancelling out of the subject through the captain’s realization that he has been wrong about himself, through his self- exposure, refocuses the reader’s attention away from the constative or cogni- tive “content” of the captain’s hypothetical previous identity (here shown to be irrelevant) onto the performative act of exposure itself. This is why it is significant that Saer stages thismoment before the encounter with the Colas- tiné Indians. This encounterwith the otherwill also take place, and it will also be traumatic, although, as the narrator is careful to point out, not nearly as terrifying as themelancholic sigh of the captain that anticipates it. This is the </page> <page sequence="13"> E r i n G r a f f Z i v i n   8 7 melancholic sigh of the marrano subject, if not of the historical crypto-Jew, then of themarrano-as-metonym, the spectral secret that haunts the Spanish imperial subject from its very inception. Why do we need literature to alert us to this secret, especially if we are to consider the idea of the secret as that which can neither be revealed nor concealed? Couldn’t we just as well “do without” literature, as Derrida sug- gests in the epigraph to this paper, ormight Saer’s novel offer the possibility of a literary discourse that would bearwitness to that which “exceeds the play of veiling/unveiling . . . forgetting/anamnesis”? If the performative exposure of the constitutive error of the modern subject can be relayed through literary discourse, through a discourse that alludes to its own failure to recall, how are we to understand the premature event of El entenado? Does the event serve as the condition of possibility of the narrative, or does the narrative serve as the condition of possibility of the event? What political subject, or nonsubject, what equivocal sovereign subject, does the novelmake possible?What kind of politics does literature condition, if it does anything at all? Finally, what relationship does reading, criticism, theory, philosophy have with such a literary event, if we can even claim that something has indeed happened? Imagine, in conclusion, an intellectual endeavor that responds to a demand—it could be a literary demand, it could be a political demand—that is impossible to fulfill, a critical practice that would be relentless in its pursuit of this impossible event, a reading thatwouldbearwitness to the “wrong” that, to return to Rancière, lies at the heart of the political. This would be a critical practice performedby a subject that is constituted inher fidelity to an event of reading asmisunderstanding,who (in Lacanian terms) never givesway onher desire to pursue the “passion” that marks literature and its impossibility, “in place of the secret,” in the secret’s place. But, then again: I could be wrong.

The English translation of this essay was published in 2011 as “Literary Misunderstanding” in The Politics of Literature. 3. This is trickybecauseRancière’sLaMésentente: Politique et philosophiehasbeen translated into English as Disagreement: Politics and Philosophy (1999). Gabriel Rockhill argues that disagree- ment isnotsameasmisunderstanding,butheusesmisunderstandingheretorefer to“ageneral lack of comprehension” (2004, 4), rather than as that which is constitutive of language itself. Really, though, the problemhas less to dowith translation, or between a different interpre- tation of the correct “meanings” ofmésentente in French and “misunderstanding” in Eng- lish, and more to do with competing meanings of these terms within each language. 4. In “Rancière’s Leftism, Or, Politics and Its Discontents,” Bruno Bosteels challenges the equivalence between Rancière’s treatment of art and politics: “if art is treated according to the vaguely historical order of three regimes of identification (the ethical regime, the representative regime, and the aesthetic regime), without there being any essence proper to art in itself,” the same is not true for his discussion of politics. While he outlines a historical triad for politics (archi-politics, para-politics, andmeta-politics), there exists “an essence or a rational kernel of politics, which subsequently would have been covered up, denied, repressed, or obscurely designated in those three dominant forms of political philosophy” (2009, 162). 5. “Literary dissensusworks on changes in the scale andnature of individualities, on deconstruc- tion of the relationships between things and meanings. In this, it differentiates itself from the work of political subjectificationwhich configures newcollectives bymeans ofwords. Political dissensus operates in the form of subjectification procedures that identify the declaration by the anonymous that they are a collective, an us, with reconfiguration of the field of political objects and actors. Literature goes in the opposite direction to this organization of the percep- tual field arounda subject of utterance. It dissolves the subjects of utterance in the fabric of the percepts and affects of anonymous life. Literary ‘misunderstanding,’ then, tends to oppose the staging of a speech peculiar to political disagreementwith a different staging, one that deploys other relationships betweenmeanings and states of things that come along and invalidate the markers of political subjectification” (2011, 43–44). 6. “In the recent history of politicized art, two forms are readily identifiable. The first form, which might be referred to as content-based commitment, is founded on the representa- tion of politicized subject matter. The second form, whichmight be called formal commit- ment, locates the political dimension of works of art in their mode of representation or expression, rather than in the subject matter represented” (Rockhill 2009, 195). 7. In the “Translator’s Introduction” to The Politics of Aesthetics, Gabriel Rockhill outlines Ran- cière’sconceptsofan“aestheticregimeofart” (or literature)andthenotionof “literarity”as“the status of awrittenword that freely circulates outside any systemof legitimation” (2004, 5). 8. “Inquisitional logic represents the violent face of the dominant concepts of modernity: identity as reflexivity or self-presence (and difference as its corresponding mirror image), sovereignty, and the idea of the political as the Schmittian divide between friend and enemy. It accounts for the link between Inquisition and colonialism, given the historically- and geopolitically-specific conditions of Imperial expansion across the Atlantic. Inquisi- </page> <page sequence="15"> E r i n G r a f f Z i v i n   8 9 tional logic, finally, grounds itself in the violent conversion of others (Jews andMuslims in the IberianPeninsula and indigenous peoples in theAmericas), in the representation of the Americas as anewandeminently ‘convertible’world, and in the subsequent ‘re-conversion’ of these subjects through interrogation and torture” (Graff Zivin 2014, xii). 9. We can also identify both approaches to truth or meaning in literary criticism and philos- ophy, so that a text ostensibly grounded in an identitarian logic might offer the possibility of another, spectral, truth—a secret that would undermine the very idea of interpretive discovery or revelation, but that would, paradoxically, only come about through the act of interpretation. 10. “Es la desproporción entre lo que Solís y sus hombres pensaban de sí mismos y la función que le atribuyeron los indios al comérselos . . . caricatura del relativismo cultural, lo que vuelve al hecho impensable en su desmesura y vagamente cómico a causa del malenten- dido brutal de dos sistemas de pensamiento” (Saer 1991, 56. Quoted in Copertari 1998, 226.) 11. Gabriela Copertari, who argues that in El entenado Saer theorizes a “deconstructed” or decentered Western subject, rightly perceives in this paragraph the anticipation of the captain’s death (like the hare caught in the hunter’s trap), but I want to insist that themore significant death here is the symbolic death: that of the person he’d convinced himself he was (Copertari 1998, 230). 12. “Is the need for self-exposure a rhetorical need? But no: It conditions all rhetoric, but in doing so it also expresses its distance from all rhetoric. It is perhaps from the incalculable abyss of this need—wewant to exposeourselves, andwewant to exposeourselves toothers, without calculation, without interest, in our truth, in our pathology, and that is so, accord- ing to Kant, not out of our human character as insociable or antisocial, but out of our deepest and most intimate relation with the socius, with the other—that there can be something like an infrapolitical position, which is in itself neither properly ethical nor properly political, but which nevertheless abhors moralist betrayal. We should wonder whether thisneed,which I amcalling the infrapolitical position, condition, ordetermination, is not the reason why there should be literature. And, if there should be literature, is it also the reason forwhythereshouldbeareflectiononthe literary, and for instance, thereflectiononthe literary and on other things aswell that we call Hispanism” (Moreiras 2010, 192).
