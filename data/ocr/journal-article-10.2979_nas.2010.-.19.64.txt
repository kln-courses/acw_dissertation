<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> A BOAT OF LIGHT:   ZOHARIC IMAGES IN ZELDA’S POETRY Nitsa Kann “. . . like a chaste woman who does not go  out of the door of her house.” (Zohar 1:84b) “When she has been restored and rendered beautiful in her image,  as at the beginning, they and all the remaining hosts stand, ready to  listen to what she says, and she stands like a king among his troops.” (Zohar 3:191a) This intertextual study examines the relationship between Zelda’s poetry  and the Zohar, the chief canonical work of Jewish mysticism. The Zohar,  with its poetic nature, is a fertile source for Zelda. I shall point out com- monalities in a few of Zelda’s poems with some core zoharic symbolism,  engaging close readings of the modern poems alongside the kabbalistic  texts. This intertextuality draws on the similar essence of mystical and  literary texts, which alike aspire to express the inexpressible. My analy- sis adopts the notion of diversity of interpretations, attuned with zoharic  hermeneutics. I read Zelda’s poetry as a manifestation of the female’s  vantage point upon herself. For Zelda, the diverse character of the divine  female, the Shekhinah, is a fruitful source both for identification and for  a deep investigation of love relationships from a feminine perspective. Zelda [Schneurson-Mishkovsky] (1914–1984), who grew up in the Habad  hasidic sect, is a unique poetic phenomenon in modern Hebrew literature,  both for her artistic vocation—an exception within the hasidic world—and for  the appeal of her sensual, free-style poetry to secular readers, to the extent  that modern and postmodern poets such as Meir Wieseltier and Yona Wallach  became her declared admirers. However, Zelda’s secular readers, and scholars  64  NASHIM: A Journal of Jewish Women’s Studies and Gender Issues. © 2010 </page> <page sequence="2"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry of her work, have rarely grasped the profound zoharic-hasidic intertextuality  in her poetry.1 My study explores the zoharic symbolism that can be discerned  in several of Zelda’s poems.2 The diverse character of the divine female, the  Shekhinah, is a fruitful source for Zelda, yielding models for identification,  for deep introspection, and for investigating various topics from a feminine  perspective. This study is part of a larger one that aims to grasp the complex inter- relationship between modern literary texts and their kabbalistic precursors.  These early mystical-theosophical texts incorporate some fundamental poetic  characteristics that became a fertile source for later Hebrew literature. The  example par excellence is the chief canonical work of Jewish mysticism, the  Zohar. This rich text is not only a book of Torah interpretation, or a theosophi- cal text in the guise of commentary, but also a literary masterpiece that can be  read as a metaphysical or even a postmodern novel. The Torah interpretations  themselves are expressed in diverse genres—parables, tales and dreams—while  the plentiful use of metaphors and similes that function as kabbalistic symbols  can be perceived as symbolic poetry at its best. Although the Zohar’s literary  qualities have already been recognized by some major kabbalistic research- ers, its literary study is still in its infancy.3 In order not to fall into a general or  superficial understanding of the zoharic symbolism that has penetrated modern  Hebrew literature, there is a need to analyze the original text with an emphasis  on its literary traits. Both mystical and literary texts aspire to express that which by definition is  inexpressible. Gershom Scholem describes this paradox in the following way: The mystic discovers in language . . . something pertaining to its structure  which is not adjusted to a communication of what is communicable, but  rather—and all symbolism is founded on this paradox—to a communication  of what is non-communicable, of that which exists within it for which there  is no expression; and even if it could be expressed, it would in no way have  any meaning, or any communicable “sense.” 4 Whether the mystical text deals with theosophy or aims to express a mysti- cal experience, it is confined within the boundaries of language. Thus, the  mystic aspiration to express the essence of the inexpressible—the realm of  the divine—is almost doomed in advance. The experience of unio mystica,  union with God, is particularly incommunicable. A similar paradox exists in  65 </page> <page sequence="3"> Nitsa Kann the literary text. The poet’s aspiration to touch the inner essence of things and  communicate them through poetic language can never fully be achieved. The  union of the poet with the realm of emotions—what I call the unio poetica— cannot authentically be reconstructed. As C.N. Bialik wrote: “language with  all its associations does not introduce us at all into the inner area, the essence  of things . . . On the contrary, language itself stands as a barrier before them.”5  This is the most salient linkage between the mystical and the literary experi- ence and their respective textual outcomes. It seems that the urge to express  in words is stronger than the flickering awareness of this unbridgeable gap  between the “inner area” and its poetic expression. In tune with zoharic hermeneutics, I adopt the notion of diversity of interpre- tations.6 The kabbalistic view of the Torah and the Zohar as reflections of the  ever-changing nature of the supernal worlds charges these texts with infinite  interpretations.7 The text remains unchanged and yet reflects, over and over,  a supernal process. Furthermore, in the eyes of Jewish mystics, the aspira- tion to a complete and final understanding is an unnecessary compulsion of  self-limitation, a projection of one’s own limits onto an infinite and dynamic  essence—the Torah. R. Israel ben Eliezer, the Baal Shem Tov, founder of  Hasidism, said once: “The Zohar has a new meaning every day.”8 Even more  radical is the tradition attributed to R. Isaac Luria (also known by his acronym  as “the Ari”), who claimed that “the Zohar’s sayings keep changing at every  given moment.”9 Moshe Idel presents an interesting analogy between the text  of the Torah or of the Zohar and a “crystal ball, which always stays itself in  spite of moving diverse colors which are reflected in it.”10 In order to emphasize the poetic characteristics of the zoharic text, I often  present it to the reader in the form of a poem. In the following pages, I shall  present some of these texts together with a few of Zelda’s poems, engaging  close reading of both the modern poems and the kabbalistic texts. Zelda’s poem “When the King Was Alive” evokes one of the most beautiful  parables of the Zohar. This poetic parable opens with a standard midrashic  question. Referring to the Torah, which “reveals herself from her sheath and  hides herself right away,” the text asks “To what can this be compared?” The  answer is: וזיחב אתריפש יהיאד אתמיחרל הליד אלכיה וג ורימטב אתרימט יהיאו אוירב אתריפשו .ורימטב והיא אלא אשנ ינב היב ןיעדי אלד האדיחי אמיחר הל תיאו 66 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="4"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry רידת התיב ערתל רבע הל םיחרד אמיחר וגמ אמיחר אוהה .רטס לכל יוניע ףיקז רידת התיב ערת רחסא אמיחר אהד תעדי יהיא תדבע המ ןמת יהיאד ארימט אלכיה אוההב אריעז תחתפ אמיחר יבגל אהפנא תאילגו .תאיסכתאו תרדהתא דימו ולכתסא אלו ומח אל אמיחר יבגל ווהד ןוניא לכ יודוחלב אמיחר רב השפנו היבלו יועמו .הרתבא ולזא היל תמיחרד ומיחר וגמד עדיו אדח אעגר היבגל תאילגתא .היל ומיחר היבגל ארעתאל To a lovely princess, beautiful in every way and hidden deep within her palace. She has one lover, unknown to anyone; he is hidden too. Out of his love for her, this lover passes by her gate constantly, lifting his eyes to every side. She knows that her lover is hovering about her gate constantly. What does she do? She opens a little window in her hidden palace and reveals her face to her lover, then swiftly withdraws, concealing herself. No one near the lover sees or reflects, only the lover, and his heart and his soul and everything within him flow out to her. And he knows that out of love for him she revealed herself for that one moment to awaken love in him.11 The question “to what this can be compared” reveals the duality of the  hermeneutics. The Zohar provides its own interpretation of the text by com- paring the princess (reḥimta, literally: a female lover) to the Torah, and the  “lover” (reḥima) to the man who is wise of heart, i.e., the mystic. However the  67 </page> <page sequence="5"> Nitsa Kann poetic choice of the parable seems to open it to yet more meanings. The text  is authoritative but at the same time allows pluralistic readings. As mentioned  above, the mystic should strive to renew the given text, by providing it with  new and unique interpretations. This “postmodern” approach of the Zohar  is especially evident in its more poetic portions (like the above parable). In  accordance with this ancient/postmodernist approach, I would like to suggest  an interpretation of this parable, as one of many possible readings permitted  by the text.12 Looking at the parable from the point of view of its archetypal and literary  characteristics, we note that the female figure appears as both passive and  active. These two polar traits are based, respectively, on European folklore and  on an original kabbalistic twist. The traditional-legendary notion is that of a  helpless princess imprisoned in a palace or a fortress, often by her own father,  and waiting for her hero, the prince, to save her. The separation between the  lovers is usually a consequence of the authority’s—the father’s—conviction that  the match is unfit. The rebellious daughter who dares to think differently is  kept behind a locked door, in the hope that she will regain her wits. The zoharic  text uses the universal type motifs of this legend13 but almost empties them of  their original content. The father—“the king”—does not appear in the parable,  and although his ghostly character is felt behind the scenes (either owing to  the zoharic author’s or/and the reader’s acquaintance with the princess-in-the- fortress legend, or as part of the kabbalistic symbolism of the “royal family”),  he does not play any significant role in the relationship between the princess  and her lover. In addition to the universal type motifs, the parable alludes to  the biblical notion of “the king’s daughter is all glorious within.” (Ps. 45:14)  The usual talmudic understanding of “within” is “in her house”:14 The woman  evinces her modesty by staying inside and not showing herself to the outside  world, mainly so as not to arouse the evil inclination (yetzer hara‘) in a man.  The helpless-modest princess is a manifestation of the passive feminine figure. Yet, the parable does not remain within the boundaries of this concept.  Although the princess is “hidden deep within her palace,” it is she who actu- ally rules the situation. By her will “she opens a little window in her hidden  palace, revealing her face to her lover,” and then “swiftly withdraws, conceal- ing herself.” The lover, on the other hand, is totally dependent on her actions  and good will. All he can do is to “pass” or “hover about her gate constantly.”  Within Western literary culture, the male suitor is the more active figure in  the courting scene (and even hovering can be accompanied by serenades),  68 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="6"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry and, consequently, his actions are usually emphasized and described in more  detail than hers. In the zoharic parable, the sought-after one, the princess, is  the active figure, and, accordingly, it is her acts that are described in detail.  Moreover, her intentions are quite pointed. “Why does she do that?” In order  “to awaken love in him.” It is as if the roles of female and male in the “courting  game” have been reversed. The female figure is no longer the helpless princess  waiting for her redeeming knight, but rather the initiator, while the male figure  becomes the passive one who can only wait for “that one moment” of seeing  his beloved’s face. The superiority of the female’s strength over that of the male can be explained  simply by the zoharic princess-Torah equation. Undoubtedly, the sacred text  of the Torah is superior to man. Yet the inequality between the two seems to  disappear when it comes to their mutual desire; “out of love for her” versus “out  of love for him.” The use of the same words to describe the “emotional” status  of both the man and the Torah inescapably raises the question of whether their  “love” is truly equal. It is not entirely far-fetched to assume a mutual depen- dency between the superior and the inferior. In fact, this is precisely how the  kabbalists perceive the correlation between the higher and the lower worlds.  One of many examples is the influence of human sexual intercourse on the uni- fications of the sefirot. Although there is a profound difference between divine  and human, the latter is like a mirror to the former, in a neo-platonic as well as  a psychological sense. According to Adin Steinsaltz, “man in his purity should  be able to perceive the whole order of relations between God and the world, and  the order of relations within the sefirot as this is reflected in the microcosm of  his human existence.”15 One symbolic system refers simultaneously to different  domains—those of the sefirot and of the human soul. While turning the attention of the reader towards the correlation between  the human being and the sacred text, the zoharic parable also opens the gate  to another archetypal-psychological layer, that dealing with the essence of the  male-female relationship. It raises the subtle role of initiative within the context  of mutual attraction and expresses the ultimate existence of love in the pres- ent tense. It is as if the whole concept of love is contained in the revelation of  “that one moment,” like a seed which embodies all versions and potentialities  of love. The zoharic text does not provide any verbal dialogue between the  figures, but rather concentrates on their emotions and intentions, which are  hidden from the outside world and yet are known to them. The “emotional  plot” has neither past nor future. The present moment is the only evidence of  69 </page> <page sequence="7"> Nitsa Kann love. The action of momentary revelation expresses the renewal of desire, the  awakening of the erotic tension between the lovers. The assurance of mutual  attraction and the urge for unification create a unique sense of the intense  eroticism before fulfillment. To what can this be compared? To Zelda’s poem “When the King Was  Alive.” ”ךלמה יח רשאכ“ ךְֶלֶמַּה יַח רֶשֲׁאַכּ ךְֶלֶמַּה תַבּ דוֹבְכּ הָיָה הָמיִנְפּ .תִיַבַּבּ .םיִסיִסְר םיִסיִסְר תִיַבַּה וָשְׁכַע ךְֶלֶמַּה יַח רֶשֲׁאַכּ תוּעיִנְצ הָתְיָה .גַח הָיָה ךְֶלֶמַּה יַח רֶשֲׁאַכּ םּיִנָשׁוֹשׁ תָבַּשַּׁה הָתְיָה .עַצֶפּ איִה וָשְׁכַע ךְֶלֶמַּה יַח רֶשֲׁאַכּ בֵלַּבֶּשׁ תוֹבָשֲּׁחַמַה וּיָה םיִרֳפִּצ ,בֶרֶעָבּ וּפְפוֹעְתִהֶשׁ .בֶרֶעָה תַחוּנְמִל וּכִּחֶשׁ יַשָׁרָשׁ םיִפוּשֲׂח וָשְׁכַע .םֶהיֵלֲע םיִכְרוֹדּ םיִשָׁנֲאַו “When the King Was Alive” When the king was alive, the glory of the princess was within, in the house. Now the house is in shambles. When the king was alive there was modesty, 70 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="8"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry there was celebration. When the king was alive, the Sabbath was roses; now it’s a wound. When the king was alive, the heart’s thoughts were birds flying about in the evening, waiting for evening’s rest. Now my roots are exposed and people trample them.16 The parable and the poem use similar materials; there is a princess (the bat  melekh or “king’s daughter” of the poem; the reḥimta or female lover of the  Zohar), who stays within the house and has a minimal relationship with the  outside world. The main linkage between the two texts is the reference to Ps.  45:14; while the Zohar merely alludes to it by describing the princess as being  within the palace, the poem cites it almost directly. “The glory” is a metonymic  anthropomorphization of the princess’s quality. On the one hand, it functions  as a single virtue that embodies her; on the other, the literary device allows the  separation of the female figure from this trait. If “the glory” stays within the  house, that does not necessarily mean that her other characteristics stay there  as well. Thus, the thoughts of the princess are “flying about in the evening,”  contrasting their movement and with the non-movement of the glory, even if  both stay within the domain of the house. However, precisely the missing figure—the king—seems to fill the house.  Unlike in the parable, where the king’s spirit can be felt but is not the text’s  main concern, in the poem he becomes the text’s core. On the immediate level,  the poem deals with a father–daughter relationship. The speaker of the poem  compares the past, “when the king was alive,” and the present, without him.  The word “death” is never mentioned, and the traumatic event is described in  positive terms—“when the king was alive.” As a result of the king’s absence,  his daughter’s whole life has changed; what used to be a house is now a “sham- bles,” and the Sabbath that was “roses” is now a “wound.” This last example  points to the potentiality of the present situation. Since a rose is a flower with  thorns, it is not only an esthetic object but also a potential source of pain.  The “wound” is already implied in the “roses.” Similarly, the likening of “the  heart’s thoughts” to “birds” is metonymically connected with the bare “roots,”  71 </page> <page sequence="9"> Nitsa Kann since birds are associated with trees. The salience of the derived metaphor is  in the change of the speaker’s identity. It is the only time in the poem that the  personal voice—“my roots”—appears. The transformation from a third-person  to a first-person speaker turns the whole parabolic nature of the poem into a  lyric expression par excellence. This last metaphor also turns the reader’s attention to another layer of the  poem: the interior dialogue. The king’s absence coincides with the absence of  a dialogue. There is no insight into the “king’s” perspective on his life with  the “princess.” Furthermore, it seems that even when the “king” was alive,  the “princess” had a separate, hidden life. While her “glory” stayed within  the house, her “heart’s thoughts”17 were “flying about” freely, suggesting an  entire interior world that was solely her own. This notion leads to one of the  poem’s essential motifs, that of the poet’s suffering as a result of being exposed.  Apparently, the main cause of that suffering is the beloved’s death, but the last  two lines reveal that the new, insecure situation enables a permanent potential  for exposure to the outside world. In that sense the poem can be perceived as  an indirect ars-poetic statement. Exposing the intensely personal world of the  poet is necessary and evident in the existence of the poem itself, but it is com- bined with suffering. The interior world of the poet becomes a “shambles,” in  the form of fragmentary lines; the wholeness of the private world, the interior  “house” of the poet, has been broken into pieces. Expressing the most per- sonal emotions and giving them to the outside world has led to the death of a  hidden spiritual life. With the death of a loved one, a transition occurs from the  emotional-interior world of the poet to the poetic-exterior world. This notion touches one of the main interests in the present discussion: tran- sition from the tohu (void or nothingness) experience of non-words into the  poetic text. Suffering occurs not only because of the exposure of the interior  world; it is also an unavoidable outcome of inaccurate “translation” of non- verbal language18 into the poetic text. Although the “master of poetry” to use  Bialik’s term,19 succeeds in getting closer to the inner essence of things, she  can never fully touch them; accordingly, the poem can only be a fragmentary  and incomplete expression of the original experience. This fragmentary nature of the poetic text allows us to apply zoharic herme- neutics. One example relates to the possible dual identity of the “king.” Though  “king” and “princess” might be taken literally as referring to father and daugh- ter, the relationship between the figures in the poem might also be interpreted  as that of husband and wife. Hamutal Bar-Yosef, citing the biographical fact  72 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="10"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry that it was written after the death of Zelda’s husband, presents this interpre- tation of the poem as the obvious one; to her, it is clearly about the experi- ence of widowhood.20 However, beyond the questionable nature of posing an  immediate correlation between biographical information and a poetic text, it  is plausible, on the symbolic level, to understand the father-daughter relation- ship as an intimate one. As Bar-Yosef herself comments, “behind the word  ‘king’. . . stands a whole world of symbolic associations, which leans on thou- sands of years of Jewish literary tradition.”21 Indeed, the zoharic symbolism  of the “royal family” moves freely from father–daughter to husband–wife  metaphors, with the former not perceived as incestuous, since the text refers  to the supernal world of the Sefirot—although the text undoubtedly deals with  the taboo as well. A comparison of the intimacy in the zoharic parable with Zelda’s poem will  reveal both similarity and difference. In both situations, love is not fulfilled at  the present moment. In the zoharic text, however, there is a certainty that love  is yet to come, and the lovers’ yearning for unification is full of hope; in Zelda’s  poem, the love has been fulfilled in the past, and there is an utter despair of its  recurrence, since the lovers are ineluctably separated by death. Furthermore,  the intense erotic situation that precedes the fulfillment is completely missing,  and the beloved is absent. Moreover, even the past time when the couple lived  together was not as idyllic as it appears on first reading. Alongside the harmo- nious life in which “there was celebration” and “the Sabbath was roses,” the  female figure had a life of her own that could not be shared with her spouse.  In contrast to the longing for unification that is the core of the zoharic text,  the essence of the poem is the interior world of the poet and its vulnerability  to change, whether brought on by a death or by the complex identity of the  religiously observant woman artist. This factor refers not only to the known facts of Zelda’s life as a religious,  widowed poet, but also to the salience of Jewish symbolism in her poetry.  Not only may the “king” refer symbolically to God and/or to the male aspect  of God, the sefirah of Tif’eret; but several other concepts in the poem— “modesty,” “celebration” (or holiday), “Sabbath”—refer to integral elements of  the pious way of life and may allude to mystical symbolism as well. The same  concepts that apparently describe positive elements of Jewish observance  simultaneously contain a negative valence. For instance, the free-spirited  “heart’s thoughts” do not actually reach anybody in the outside world, but  rather are “flying about in the evening.” But when the change occurs, and the  73 </page> <page sequence="11"> Nitsa Kann “guardian of modesty,”—the male figure—disappears, they are exposed as  poetry to the outside world. The female figure in Zelda’s poem apparently lived a secure and good life  with her partner. Yet, her ability to express the unspoken “heart’s thoughts” is  realized only after suffering and separation from her beloved. In other words,  the happy life of the simple, quiet, “modest” woman who functions well within  her house and celebrates holidays and the Sabbath (for which she most likely  makes the necessary preparations) is illusory. She lives within the darkness of  the house. She cannot be a whole person until she expresses herself not only  as a wife, but also, in this case, as a creative woman. The separation from her  spouse, even in the most tragic way, is paradoxically necessary so that she  may become a whole person. In addition to the suffering involved in gaining  consciousness, the woman artist has to deal with that of being exposed to the  outside world. This inner struggle of the religious woman creative artist is of  course not limited to those bound by the ethical decorum of the pious life; it  may hold true for any creative artist, and perhaps even more so for a female one. The essence of the feminine can be traced in the symbolic triangle of Sab- bath–roses–birds. In zoharic symbolism, these stand for the female aspect of  God, the Shekhinah. I will discuss the rose symbol below, in relation to another  poem; however, it is worth mentioning here that in one passage from the Zohar  the Shekhinah is symbolized by the rose, tightly closed, that opens out on the  Sabbath “to receive perfumes and scents, and to bestow souls and delights upon  her children.”22 The textual closeness of two symbols for different aspects of  the same entity allows the perception of the process of transformation within  the Shekhinah. The zoharic symbolic notion of the Sabbath derives from pre-existing Jewish  tradition,23 but, as in other salient cases, the Zohar develops and transforms  the familiar symbol: תבשד אזר תבש יהיא דחאד אזרב אדחאתאד .דחאד אזר הלע ירשמל תדחאתא אהד אתבש ילעמד אתולצ ד”חאד אזרב אשידק אריקי אייסרוכ .האלע אשידק אכלמ הלע תנקתתאו ארחא ארטסמ תשרפתאו תדריתא יהיא אתבש לייע דכ 74 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="12"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry אשידק וריהנד אדוחיב תראתשא יהיאו הנימ ןירבעתמ ןיניד לכו אשידק אכלמ יבגל ןירטע המכב תרטעתאו ןיקרע והלכ אנידד יראמו ןיזגור ינטלוש לכו ןימלע והלכב ארחא ונטלוש תילו האלע וריהנב ןיריהנ אהפנאו אשידק אמעב אתתל תרטעתאו ,ןיתדח ןיתמשנב ןרטעתמ והלכו ןיפנאד וריהנב הל אכרבל אתולצד אתוריש ןידכ The secret of Sabbath: She is Sabbath! United in the secret of one, Drawing upon Her the secret of one. When Sabbath enters She is alone, separated from the Other Side, all judgments removed from Her. Basking in the oneness of holy light, She is crowned over and over to face the holy King. All powers of wrath and masters of judgment flee from Her. There is no power in all worlds aside from Her. Her face shines with a light from beyond, She is crowned below by the holy people, all of whom are crowned with new souls. Then the beginning of prayer, blessing Her with joy, with beaming faces.24 The declaration “She is Sabbath” expresses the correlation between the  grammatical characteristic of the Hebrew word shabbat as a feminine noun  and the female nature of the symbolized subject. That is to say, the word “she”  reinforces the perception of Sabbath as a feminine entity, yet her specific nature  is coded and concealed. However, for the kabbalist who knows the symbolic  language, “She” is a reference to the female aspect of God, the sefirah of  Binah and/or the Shekhinah: “Shekhinah (often the Divine Daughter) is the  Sabbath Queen, entering the palace of time every Friday evening at sunset. As  the seventh sefirah below Binah (the Divine Mother), Shekhinah is also the  75 </page> <page sequence="13"> Nitsa Kann seventh primordial day. Friday night is the time of Her union with Her male  counterpart, Tif’eret, so the Sabbath is God’s wedding celebration.”25 My main interest in this zoharic text in relation to Zelda’s poem is its pre- sentation of the female character, in and of herself and in relation to her male  counterpart. In this instance, the text focuses not on the “supernal intercourse”  or the “wedding celebration,” but on the subtle process that the female aspect  must complete before the “unification.” Like the female figure in Zelda’s  poem, “when Sabbath enters She is alone.” Such solitude might result from  the death of the beloved, but it might also be an existential loneliness in spite  of being together, or even a state of mind originating in togetherness. Accord- ingly, the female figure must separate herself from “the Other Side” in order  to gain a real “oneness.” Without ignoring the demonic meaning of the “Other  Side” (sitra aḥra) in the Kabbalah, I allow myself to broaden the concept in  a psychological-archetypal way. It is as if the female figure must enter the  realm of conscious separation before encountering love. In this respect, the  “demonic realm” is none other than the “demons” inside the human being.  Aloneness is an excellent ground for fears and anxieties to emerge, like “the  heart’s thoughts” that “were birds.” Similarly, “all judgments removed from Her” may allude specifically, in  the Zohar, to eliminating the influence of “harsh judgment”—the sefirah of  Din—thus allowing the Shekhinah to receive abundant grace from the sefirah  of Ḥesed (ultimate mercy). However, the removal of judgments might also be an  inevitable progress of awareness. The process of becoming a whole person— “Shabbat”—has three necessary stages: aloneness, separation from fears, and  removal of harsh self-judgments. In the Kabbalah, the Hebrew letter shin with  its three prongs is interpreted as standing for the three fathers—Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob—or their corresponding sefirot: Ḥesed, Din and Tif’eret.  Accordingly, I tend to see the female entity—the daughter, bat—as becoming,  a whole, conscious person (Shabbat = shin + bat) after completing the three  stages of awareness.26 The profound difference between the zoharic text and Zelda’s poem lies in  the notions of creativity and reception. The Zohar stresses the relationship  between the Shekhinah and the “holy people” below. They crown her with  their prayers, and in return she crowns them with “new souls,” equivalent to the  “extra soul” (neshamah yeterah) that “enables one to leave weekday concerns  behind and experience the joy and depth of the Sabbath.”27 However, in addi- tion to this traditional understanding of the concept, the “extra soul” can be  76 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="14"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry understood as a creative state of mind, similar to the meaning of the Shekhinah  as a muse, especially in modern Hebrew. Apparently, the muse arises precisely  on the eve of the Sabbath in the form of “the heart’s thoughts.” However, the  reception of the “extra soul” is entirely different in the two texts. In the Zohar,  the “holy people” welcome the female entity, “blessing Her with joy, with  beaming faces”; in Zelda’s poem, it is related to suffering from exposure— “Now my roots are exposed / and people trample them.” The “birds” that “wait  for evening’s rest” do not meet “joy, with beaming faces,” but, on the contrary,  encounter only “trampling” and exposure. Instead of reaching the longed-for  rest, the “princess” in the poem finds herself in an even deeper state of rest- lessness and humiliation. The whole picture of a harmonious exhilaration of  creativity crashes into pieces, into a fragmentary text, which is the poem. Apart from the declared absence of the male father-figure—“the king”—there  is another absence in the subtext of “When the King Was Alive”—that of the  female mother-figure, “the queen.” The mother-figure does appear in many  of Zelda’s poems. In “My Mother’s Room Was Lighted,” the closing lines  express, once again, the conscious separation of the speaker from her spouse  and/or her mother, and at the same time create an unconscious identification  with the mother: ”ראוה ימא לש הרדח“ חַלַּה דיִסַבּ גַזָמ רֵוִּחַה דָּיַסַּה קַדְבֶּשׁ קַדּ דֶרֶו .לָלוֹע לֶשׁ ךְוּיִּח ,ַחוּפַּתַּה תַצִּנ לֶשׁ ויִז ] . . .

[ . . . ] The big room, the interior, is dark like the cave of Rabbi Shim‘on Bar-Yochai. A silence of sea in it – a Sabbath in it, like the world to come. In the whole apartment is stillness. My husband went to the office. My mother is in her prayers’ temple. I am in the kitchen.

And maybe he will turn them into a flower and maybe he will turn them  into a butterfly deep-nocturnal-soft, deep-nocturnal-live.28 The self-image of a colorful tapestry echoes the exposed roots in “When the  King Was Alive.” The closing lines express despair at being lost in the oblivion  of the dark-deep abyss, and at the same time the hope of becoming something  else, dual in nature, retaining the dark elements of death, but also containing  78 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="16"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry esthetic and light elements, “soft” and “alive,” like a flower or a butterfly. Inter- estingly, the blue of the inland sea and the dark (black) of the abyss resemble  the colors of the Shekhinah in her dual role as consuming force and sustainer  of the supernal light.29 The poem’s title, “My Mother’s Room Was Lighted,”  indicates that its main subject is the mother and/or her space. However, the  final lines show that the contour between self-observation and the mother’s  description is at times “deep” and at times “soft.” The poem’s opening lines enable a peek into the home shared by the mother  and her daughter, with the addition of the male figure, the husband. On a real- istic level, the darkness of “the big room” can be understood by its location in  the “interior” of the house. Yet the text tempts us to a psychological level with  its simile, “like the cave of Rabbi Shim‘on Bar-Yohai.” According to a talmudic  legend well known in Zelda’s cultural world, Rabbi Shim‘on, a supporter of  the Bar Kokhba rebellion, spent twelve years hiding from the Roman authori- ties with his son in a cave, nourished by a miraculous carob tree.30 Kabbalistic  tradition ascribes the Zohar to none other than Rabbi Shim‘on, who is also the  main figure in the text, and a late traditional legend recounts that he wrote it  during his stay in the cave.31 Apart from implying an atmosphere of isolation  and loneliness, then, the cave-like room also indicates a self-sufficient way of  being. The mother-daughter home (since the husband “went to the office”) is,  again, an ambivalent entity, a world both self-sufficient and isolated. Zelda’s use of zoharic symbolism and her mention of the historic and legend- ary figure Rabbi Shim‘on Bar-Yohai create what Julia Kristeva calls “poetic  language.”32 Zelda’s poem is an example par excellence of an intersection  between various texts. As Kristeva says, the “poetic language is read as at least  double,”33 not only in reference to the above-mentioned simile, but also through  what I call grains of meaning which can be read as references to texts from the  past. These are words such as “Sabbath,” “the world to come,” and “the temple  of her prayers,” to mention a few. The poem’s uniqueness is created by the  juxtaposition of such loaded grains of meaning with secular, daily, mundane  details. “My husband went to the office” and “I am in the kitchen” are said in  the same breath as “my mother is in her temple of prayers.” The pronoun “her” subtly yet significantly changes the “temple of prayers,”  which might otherwise be taken as a reference to a physical place—the syn- agogue—into a metaphoric place, or an inner-psychological state of mind.  Accordingly, the title of the poem, “My Mother’s Room Was Lighted,” may  refer simultaneously to a physical room and to an inner-spiritual one, like the  79 </page> <page sequence="17"> Nitsa Kann “interior” big, dark room. The mother is seemingly depicted as different from  the other figures in the poem. Whereas the others’ existence is grounded in  the mundane world—“the office,” “the kitchen”—the mother’s existence is  immersed in the spiritual-pious world. However, the double reading occurs  once again. Even the figure of the whitewasher appearing at the beginning of  the poem, mixing “a finest fine rose” into the whitewash, is not situated entirely  in the mundane. This poem is a characteristic example of a “deep-nocturnal-soft” thread con- necting mother and daughter. The poetic declaration of the title, focusing on  the mother figure, is partly fulfilled, up to the self-description of the speaker  in line seven of the second stanza—“I am in the kitchen.” From that point on,  the detailed descriptions of the special qualities of Friday as the day on which  one enters into the holy Sabbath, and the inner character of life in general, are  attributed to both mother and daughter. Yet the crescendo of the death image  refers directly to the daughter, the poetic speaker (“When I die”). The declared  subject of the poem is transformed into deep introspection about the speaker’s  personal death. Even if the background echoes the daughter’s anxiety at the  mother’s inevitable death, this expression undoubtedly deals with the speaker’s  own death and beyond it. I believe that the zoharic model of the coexistence  of identification and dissimilarity between the two female aspects of God— Binah, the mother, and Shekhinah, the daughter—is a salient echo chamber in  this poem and others by Zelda. The poem’s main subject is transformed freely,  and the contours delimiting mother and daughter are at times blurred and at  times clear. At times, the figures of the mother and the daughter can stand for two phases  in a woman’s life. This notion is illustrated through the symbols of the rose and  the lily, both of which are used extensively in the Zohar as well as in Zelda’s  poetry:  ןינווגב אקמוס תנשוש רתבל ןיקורי הליד ןיפרטד תלצבחכ אקורי אתימדקב ח”ת  תנשש .אהנווג תאינשו אנווגל אנווגמ תאינתשאד תנשש .ןיפרט תישב הנשש .ןירווח  תקבדתאד רתב תלצבח ירקא אכלמב היב אגוודזאד איעבד אנדב תלצבח אתימדקב  תנשש .םינשוש ויתותפש )’ה ריש( יבתכד ןיגב תנשש ירקא ןיקישנ ןוניאב אכלמב היב .אנידל אנמז ימחרל ןינמז שיבל ןינמזו בטל ןינמז אהנווג איינשמ איהד םיקמעה 80 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="18"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry Come and see. At first she is green like a lily (ḥavatzelet), whose leaves are  green; afterward “a rose” (shoshanah), she is red with white colors. Shosha- nah with six leaves; shoshanah, because she changes (ishtaniat) from color  to color, and varies (shaniat) her colors. “A rose”—first a lily; when she  wishes to unite with the king, she is called “lily”; after she has become  united with him, with the king, with those kisses, she is called “rose,” since  it is written “His lips are as roses” (Song of Songs 5:13). “A rose of the val- leys,” for she changes her colors, sometimes for good, sometimes for evil,  sometimes for Mercy, sometimes for Judgment.34 In this midrashic exegesis of Song of Songs 2:1—read, as it were, as “I am  the lily of Sharon and the rose of the valleys”35—both “lily” and “rose” are  symbols of Shekhinah, “the daughter.”36 The question raised by the Zohar is:  what is the difference between Shekhinah as a lily and as a rose? The poetic  assumption here is that every symbol describes a specific trait or state of the  sefirah. Here, the two flowers symbolize the different state of the Shekhinah  before and after intercourse with her male counterpart, Tif’eret. As with the  Sabbath delight (‘oneg Shabbat), the Shekhinah must have an encounter with  two polar male aspects of God—Ḥesed and Din—before she can unite in inter- course with the intermediate aspect, Tif’eret. Accordingly, she is symbolized  as a lily before intercourse and a rose after it. The difference between the two  flowers is symbolized by their typical colors. In fact, the subject seems to be  the colors themselves: “She is red with white colors” is a metaphor creating  identification between the Shekhinah and the colors “red and white,” as a result  of her transitioning from lily to rose. The color symbolism is attuned to the  three male aspects of God that influence the female aspect. Gershom Scholem  discusses the colors and their symbolism in Kabbalah: Nearly all the Kabbalists agree in saying that the Grace [Ḥesed] and Sever- ity [Din] of God are symbolized by white and red; their synthesis, realized  in the balance of Mercy [Tif’eret], is represented by the mixture of these  two colors, sometimes by purple, but above all by green.37 The process of changing color into “a rose of the valleys” is from “green” into  “red with white colors,” showing the complexity of zoharic symbolism. The  color symbols change according to the texts’ needs. Thus, since the Shekhinah,  the lowest sefirah, receives her colors from the sefirot above her, the specific  81 </page> <page sequence="19"> Nitsa Kann color attributed to her signifies, inter alia, her unification with a specific sefirah,  leading to a corresponding change in her dominant traits. In a more literary-psychological reading, the lily symbolizes a naïve young  woman who is “green” in sexual experience and does not yet even have the urge  to manifest her sexual buds. The second phase is when an adolescent becomes  a woman-rose upon beginning her menstrual period, symbolized by the color  red, and soon after starts to discover her sexuality. The new red of passion is  softened by “white colors” of modesty and shyness. The last phase is when the  young woman realizes her sexual urges with the “king” (in Freudian terms, the  projection of the daughter’s urge to unite with her father). Interestingly, from  that moment the attributes of the female transform into those of the male—“His  lips are as roses”—as if the female desire rules over him. The young woman is  still in a confused, unstable state—“for she changes her colors, sometimes for  good [white], sometimes for evil [red].” Complete sexual maturity will occur  (if at all) once she finds self-balance, a “green” synthesis of two contradictory  inner urges. The first state of “green” is not identical with the second state of  “green.” The Zohar establishes its interpretation by linguistic analysis of the noun  shoshanah, which contains the root letters of the verb “change” (sh.n.h). The  same root letters also serve for two other Hebrew verbs: “to study,” often  used of studying the Bible and other traditional texts; and “to repeat (itself).”  This reading evokes the kabbalistic notion of the Zohar as a reflection of the  ever-changing nature of the supernal worlds, enabling an infinite diversity of  interpretations of the text, and it also uncovers the text’s literary traits. Here is  not only a coded and symbolic language for the erudite mystic, but also a poetic  expression of the female’s psyche in relation to herself and to the other sex.38 To what can this be compared? To two of Zelda’s poems: “Lily of Sharon”  and “Each Rose,” which are printed next to each other in her book Penai  (Leisure).39 Even at first glance, one notes that the collocation “I am a lily of  Sharon, a rose of the valleys” is broken up by the title of the second poem,  “Each Rose.” I propose that the intertextuality here is not only with the biblical  text, but mainly with the zoharic text. ”ןורשה תלצבח“ – יִשְׁפַנ ,יִבְּל ,יַבָרְק .תֶלֶצַּבֲחַה ַחוֹחיִנ לֶא םיִאְצוֹי 82 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="20"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry רֶשׁאָה תַמיִשְׁנ .תוֹלוֹחַה שׂוֹשְׂמ בַחַטַּה ןִמ יַלֵא הָלוֹע איִה הֵנִּה קיִרָה ןִמ .קֶפא ןיֵאֵמ .תוֹנָבְלַּה ָהיֶפָנְכִבּ תַחַרוֹפּ תֶשֶׁטֻּלְמ תוּשָׁמַּמ םָלוֹעָה בוּשׁ ןוֹיְלֶע לָזַּמ .יִאָדַּו הָשֻּׁדְק-לַעַבּ “Lily of Sharon” My entrails, my heart, my soul – yearn for the lily’s fragrance. the breath of happiness the joy of sands. Here she comes up to me from the dankness from the void from no horizon. Flourishing in her white wings. Once again the world is a polished substance supernal fortune definitely possessing holiness.40 The sources of the speaker’s yearning towards the “lily of Sharon” are  physical (“my entrails”), emotional (“my heart”), and spiritual (“my soul”). The  speaker is attracted not merely to the esthetic beauty of the flower, but mainly  to its fragrance, which inspires a process of stimulation in hierarchical form,  from the senses, to the emotions, to mystical experience. This opening declara- tion of triple yearning enables the poem to deepen its literal or simple meaning,  as a song glorifying nature, into three corresponding levels of meaning: those  of the senses (“a breath,” “comes up,” “flourishing,” “the world is a polished  substance”), the emotions (“the happiness,” “joy,” “supernal fortune”), and  the spiritual (“void,” “no horizon,” “definitely possessing holiness”). And yet,  the semiotic gains the upper hand not merely as a constraint on the symbolic,  for the three categories tend to intermingle with each other. For example, the  metaphor “a breath of happiness” refers simultaneously to the physical level  83 </page> <page sequence="21"> Nitsa Kann of breathing, to the emotional state of happiness, and to the spiritual aspect of  breath: neshimah/neshamah. The same is true of the anthropomorphism “joy  of the sands,” which refers both to the physical “sands” and to the emotional  state of “joy.” The semiotic disposition is emphasized by the repetition in  enjambment “from the dankness / from the void / from no horizon.” The noun “dankness” signifies a physical material, while the two follow- ing nouns—“void” and “no horizon”—signify an abstract notion. “Void” can  describe both an emotional state of emptiness and a mystical experience of  becoming one with the infinite (ein-sof). Similarly, “from no horizon” can be  a metaphoric expression of desperation, of a future without hope (as opposed  to the commonplace expression “new horizons,” which evokes new possibili- ties, usually for the better), but it can also refer to a mystical state of mind, as  in the title of Zelda’s poem “The Unseen Carmel,” which is also the name of  one of her books of poetry. Circling back to the first of these parallel phrases, “from the dankness,” the  physical state can be filled with an emotional state of mustiness, an inability to  be renewed. The preceding words, “here she comes up . . . from the . . .” allude  to Song of Songs 3:6: “Who is she that comes up from the desert . . .?” At first  reading, “from the dankness” seems to pose an oppositional relation toward the  biblical source. The female figure majestically coming up from the desert is  ironically diminished and narrowed by her inferior location in the “dankness.”  However, rereading the poetic phrase brings its traits closer to those of the origi- nal source. The lily’s location remains unmajestic and even dark (typical of its  dank place of growth), yet it (or the Shekhinah, and/or the speaker) “flourishes”  in full majesty. The only line in the poem that is a complete sentence (in Hebrew),  “flourishing in her white wings” seems to capture the three levels of stimula- tion. The verb poraḥat allows several meanings: the blossoming of the flower;  flourishing in the sense of thriving; and also flying away, either as a bird flying  through the air or in the sense of escaping. The omission of the subject allows it  to refer either to the first person—the poetic speaker; or to a second person—the  lily, or perhaps: the Shekhinah. On the aesthetic level as well as on the physical  level, the subject is the lily, blossoming in her white petals that are visualized as  wings. On the emotional level, the speaker expresses an inner transformation,  from a state of despair and emptiness to renewal and thriving. This change seems  to occur as a result of encountering the beauty of the lily, which led to a mystical  state of mind. The emotional disturbance has been healed due to the realization  of “the inner area, the essence of things,” in Bialik’s words.41 84 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="22"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry This is the entrance into the domain that “definitely possesses holiness.”  The closeness of the poetic speaker to the female aspect of God—Shekhi- nah—transforms her sense of despair into hope.42 The last sentence of the  poem is a closure of three levels of existence into one certainty, as the speaker  moves from a state of chaos and separation into a unification of the self: “once  again the world is a polished substance / supernal fortune / definitely pos- sessing holiness.” The expression “once again” refers to the change that has  occurred since the beginning of the poem, while simultaneously hinting at a  cyclical process that repeats itself over and over in a Sisyphean way. Through  a process of physical, emotional and spiritual awakening, the inner “world”  that, in “When the King Was Alive,” was broken into “shambles,” becomes a  refined reality, shot through with the certainty of belief in God as well as in  the self. In zoharic terms, the “lily” becomes a “rose” (shoshanah), since she  is changing (mishtanah), “sometimes for good [Mercy], sometimes for evil  [Judgment].” Furthermore, this process repeats itself (shonah) each time in a  different (shonah) form, but with an essential resemblance. The title of the next poem, “Each Rose,” continues the biblical allusion to  Song of Songs 2:1, and yet, as stated, it also breaks up the collocation. Instead  of referring to a specific “rose of the valleys,” “Each Rose” makes a general,  universal statement. ”הנשוש לכ“ יִא איִה הָנַּשוֹשׁ לָכּ ,חָטְבמַּה םוֹלָשַּׁה לֶשׁ .יִחְצִנַּה םוֹלָשַּׁה תֶרֶרוֹגְּתִמ הָנַּשוֹשׁ לָכְבּ תיִריִפַּס רוֹפִּצ .”וּתִתִּכְו“ הָּמְשֶׁשׁ הֶמְדִנְו בוֹרָק הֹכּ ,הָּנַשׁוֹשַּׁה רוֹא בוֹרָק הֹכּ ,םיִלָעֶה טֶקֶשׁ בוֹרָק הֹכּ 85 </page> <page sequence="23"> Nitsa Kann – יִא וֹתוֹא הָריִס חַק .שֵׁאָה םָי תֶא הֵצֲחַו “Each Rose” Each rose is an island of the promised peace, the eternal peace. In every rose dwells a sapphire bird whose name is “They shall beat [their swords . . .]” And the light of the rose seems so near, and its fragrance so near, and the silence of the leaves so near, that island so near – take a boat and cross the sea of fire.43 The “rose of the valleys” seems to have become simply a rose, with the  characteristics of “every rose.” However, this generalization is refuted by the  very first metaphor: “Each rose is an island.” Apart from both being singular,  separate entities, rose and island have not a single trait in common to enable  the metaphorical identification between them.44 One may think of an island as  a habitat for a rose (as in Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s The Little Prince, whose  hero nurtures a rose on his small island-shaped star), but the metaphoric rela- tions between them demand further extension of the emotional and literary  norms inhering in the noun ’iy, “island”: a place of isolation and loneliness  on the one hand, and an object of desires and dreams (especially in children’s  stories like The Little Prince or Treasure Island) on the other. In addition, the  86 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="24"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry commonplace expression “an island of silence” echoes in phrases like “the  eternal peace” and “the silence of the leaves.” Against this positive association  is another meaning of ’iy, as a prefix indicating negation or lack: “no-, un-, dis-”  (as in ’iy-vada’ut, uncertainty, and ’iy-efshar, impossible). The enjambment between the first and the second lines of the poem enables  the polar traits of the opening metaphor to dominate the whole poem. “Each  rose” can be an object of yearning, dreams, stillness and peace, and at the same  time can embody qualities of isolation, loneliness, and negation or lack. The  rest of the sentence—“of the promised peace / the eternal peace”—depicts the  positive traits and more or less abandons the negative ones. Once again, there  is an echoing of a common expression through a remodeled one: “the promised  land” (i.e., Israel) through “the promised peace.” And yet, the promise is not  only a hope to be fulfilled but also an indication of the lack of peace at the  present moment. Similarly, “the eternal peace,” affirming an everlasting state  of peace, may also indicate its interruption. The allusions to “the promised land” and to the comprehension of God as  eternity lead us to the zoharic emphasis on God as “peace.” “God is peace” is  a reading of the expression “Adonai-shalom” in Judges 6:24 (“So Gideon built  there an altar to the lord and called it Adonai-shalom”); accordingly, the Zohar  adds: “the blessed Holy One, called Shalom, Peace.”45 Daniel Matt comments  on this passage: “In Kabbalah this name suits the blessed Holy One (Tif’eret),  who harmonizes the polar opposites Ḥesed and Gevurah.”46 The word “peace”  is one of the names of Tif’eret, the balanced male aspect of God, while “the  promised land” is one of the names of Shekhinah, the female aspect and coun- terpart of Tif’eret. As Isaiah Tishby comments: [T]he female quality of the Shekhinah, the mystery of the womb, is symbol- ized by the designation “Zion” or “Holy of Holies.” . . . When the temple  was still standing, and Israel dwelt in its land, the Shekhinah also resided  there in the Holy of Holies, like a chaste woman who does not go out of the  door of her house. And when Israel went into exile, she went with them into  the lands of the other nations in order to protect them.47 The two qualities of the Shekhinah as a “chaste woman” and as a protector,  or as “a king among his troops,” are implicit in the expression “the promised  land.” Hence, the “promised peace” in Zelda’s poem gives a hint of the inner,  concealed life of the rose. Apparently, not only does the rose, as a feminine  87 </page> <page sequence="25"> Nitsa Kann entity, contain polar traits within herself, but she also performs an immanent  discourse between male and female. “An island” is not an isolated female place;  it also contains the male aspect, either as an Animus48 within the self, or as an  actual male figure. The inner, animated life of the rose becomes more explicit in the second  stanza of the poem. The image of the rose as a place—“an island”—is strength- ened by the use of the verb “dwells.” Once again, the enjambment between  the lines and the appearance of the subject only in the next line demand the  question: who dwells there? Perhaps, metaphorically, the speaker herself?  This metaphor can be expanded to the explicit subject, “a sapphire bird,” in  the stanza’s second line, especially since “bird” is feminine in Hebrew. As a  noun, “sapphire” in Hebrew is masculine (sapir); denoting a precious stone of  an intense blue color (possibly sapphire or lapis lazuli), it may allude to one  of the stones set in the breastplate of the High Priest: “The second row: a tur- quoise, a sapphire, and an amethyst” (Ex. 28:18), and to the mystical experience  of visioning God: “And they saw the God of Israel, and beneath His feet was  like a fashioning of sapphire pavement and like the very heavens for pureness”  (Ex. 24:10). The adjective, on the other hand, derives from medieval Hebrew,  in which it signifies something as clear and transparent as sapphire. “A sap- phire bird” gleams with holiness, as a stone in the breastplate and as Shekhi- nah, often symbolized by the color blue, while simultaneously conveying the  transparent yet evasive bird-like nature of the inner life. However, the immanent life of the rose is not confined to its singular female  status. The interweaving of the biblical verb vekhitetu—to crush or to pound— as the bird’s name inserts not only a tone recalling the rapid beating of a bird’s  wings, but also the plural form. Like the immanent discourse in the first stanza,  the crushing expressed in the bird’s name might indicate a permanent inner  struggle. To be sure, the allusion to Isaiah’s prophecy about the end of days is a  positive one: “and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears  into pruning hooks” (Isa. 2:4). And yet, the isolation of the verb vekhitetu  maintains its negative, “crushing” attributes. Zelda uses a sophisticated literary  device by placing it in quotation marks. The immediate justification for this is  to clarify the bird’s peculiar name, but it also emphasizes her reference to the  famous verse in Isaiah, thus uncovering and renewing a worn literary device. Perhaps as a result of the inner struggle, the last stanza seems to break (or  crush) the structure of the first two stanzas, shifting from a repeating structure  of one sentence broken into three lines into a long sentence broken into eleven  88 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="26"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry lines. A peaceful, continuous legato rhythm becomes a fragmented, excited  staccato. The repetition of the expression “so close” in reference to the positive  attributes of the rose—“the light of the rose,” “its fragrance,” and “the silence  of the leaves”—gives the impression of virtual identification of the speaker  with the “sapphire bird” that lives inside the rose. The fourth repetition of “so  close” completes the metaphoric cycle begun in the opening line of the poem.  The rose becomes an island again, sort of a nest for the “sapphire bird.” How- ever, the three senses—sight (“the light”), smell (“fragrance”), and hearing  (“the silence”)—that characterize the isolated, inner female world are set off  from the rest of the poem by a dash. Beyond this line of separation stands the  concealed female–male discourse. The female figure does not remain within  her holistic, self-contained world, but rather turns to the male figure and asks  or even orders him to come to her. The imperative verbs in masculine form— “take . . . and cross”—may be understood either as a kind of instructional  guidance (in the sense of “let me teach you” or “let me show you how to reach  me”), or as an order. The metaphoric world of the island expands to include other items that are  attributed to it in reality. Since an island is an isolated place, encircled by water,  one needs a boat to get there. Nevertheless, the text does not allow for a long  stay in the domain of reality. The oxymoronic “sea of fire” turns our attention  back not only to its metaphoric nature, but mainly to the deceitfulness and  impossibility of closeness. Harmony is retained only in the inner life of the  isolated female world, like “the inner point, the quiet one, / that exists also in  the lost heart . . .” of the amputee beggar in another of Zelda’s poems, “whose  soul too will turn into a rose / at twilight.”49 And yet, the rose-female’s world  is not self-contained. She needs the male counterpart to fulfill her identity as a  whole person. Unfortunately, this union is impossible, in accordance with the  subtext of ’iy as a negating prefix. Its meaning as “island” evokes the female  as an isolated, impenetrable entity that can only dream and hope that the male  will be able to reach her. Nevertheless, the oxymoronic nature of “the sea of fire” can also lead, para- doxically, to the “promised peace” at the beginning of the poem. The Zohar uses  the same combination of water and fire to describe the creation of the world, and  speaks of the attainment of a peaceful, “perfect spirit” between these polarized  forces.50 The drop of water, symbolizing the flow of Ḥesed, love, is joined with  the flame, symbolizing the fire of Din, rigor. It is by balancing the qualities of  love and rigor that God creates the world, and peace prevails.51 89 </page> <page sequence="27"> Nitsa Kann The undecidability of the text allows for more than one interpretation. In  the words of Rabbi Abba in the Zohar: “All is fine. Both this and that are  lucidity of the word!”52 The same goes for the interpretation of Zelda’s poem,  both in general and its last line in particular: “and cross the sea of fire.” The  acts of creating the world, joining couples and splitting the Red Sea are often  compared to each other as being of similar greatness:  והיא שנ רבד ארויצו אתונמוא אהד ה”בקד יודבוע ןיברבר ןוניא המכ ח”ת אייח ר”א .אקדכ דחו דח לכ ןיגווז גווזמ אמלע ירב ה”בק אמויו אמוי לכבו אמלעד אנווגכ Rabbi Chiyya said: “come and see how magnificent are the deeds of the  blessed Holy One! For the artistry and design of a human being resem- ble the world, and every single day the blessed Holy One creates worlds,  coupling couples, each one fittingly.53 According to the Zohar, the creation is an everlasting process, manifested  in the uniting of couples. The coupling reenacts Creation, since each human  couple constitutes a new world. The comparison of the immense difficulty  of creating a world by uniting female and male with that of splitting the Red  Sea appears in a well known midrash. According to Genesis rabbah 68:4, a  matron asked R. Yose bar Halafta what God has been doing since the six days  of creation. R. Yose responded that God is occupied with making matches. She said to him: “This is the extent of His art?!! I can do the same thing.  How many menservants, and how many maidservants do I have! In no time  at all, I can match them up.” He said to her: “If [this is] easy in your eyes, it  is as hard for the Holy One Blessed be He as splitting the Red Sea.” What  did she do? She took a thousand menservants and a thousand maidservants,  lined them up in row upon row facing one another, and she said, “This man  shall marry that woman, and this woman shall marry that man”. . . . The  next day, the ones thus matched came to the lady, one with his head blood- ied, one with her eye knocked out, another with her leg broken. She said  to them, “What [happened] to you?” One woman said, “I don’t want that  man,” and a man said, “I don’t want that woman.” Immediately she sent to  have R. Yose bar Halafta brought to her. She said to him: “There is no God  not like your God. Your Torah is true, pleasant, worthy.” 90 • Nashim 19 (2010) </page> <page sequence="28"> Zoharic Images in Zelda’s Poetry According to Zelda’s poem, crossing or splitting the “sea of fire” articulates  the difficulty and even the impossibility of the male reaching the female’s  “inner point” to join with her. Only if the polar traits can intertwine into one  world is male-female interaction possible, and peace promised. “The eternal  peace” dwells not only between the couple, but mainly within the self. The  artistic creation of the poem as a microcosm illustrates an ambivalent approach  towards love and self-completeness. While “The Lily” in the first poem can  attain a unification of the self out of a state of chaos and separation, the world  of “Each Rose” is far more complex, because the passion for her male mate  arises in her. The additional aspect of “the other,” the male counterpart, places  the inner struggle (vekhitetu) within a larger scale of reference. Yet the mystical  stratum of the poem allows for the contradictions of hope and despair, stillness  and struggle, self-containment and yearning for the other. This is the “the rose  consciousness,” as Melila Hellner-Eshed calls it, a cognitive state that deals  with “the wonder of the distinct and dual world.”54 It seems that if “paradox is  characteristic of truth,”55 Zelda’s poetry embodies it with lucidity. It is indeed  “a hidden treasure of leisure,” a poetical-mystical “gliding in a boat of light.”56 Notes: 1. Indeed, several literary scholars have pointed out the kabbalistic-hasidic echoes in  Zelda’s poetry. However, their remarks are often confined to general notions about  kabbalah and its symbolism, and they at time seem to use general spiritual-religious  and kabbalistic notions interchangeably. See, e.g., Hamutal Bar-Yosef, On Zelda’s  Poetry (Hebrew; Tel-Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1988), and Hillel Barzel, Mysticism  and Symbolism: A History of Hebrew Poetry (Hebrew; Bnei-Brak: Sifriat Poalim– Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 2008), pp. 448–603. An interesting discussion of some mystical aspects in Zelda’s poetry can be found in  Zvi Mark, “Faith and Poetry in Zelda’s Poetry: Mystical Strata in Zelda’s Ars-Poetic  Conception and Their Roots,” in Moshe Halbertal, David Kurzweil and Avi Sagi  (eds.), On Faith: Studies in the Concept of Faith and Its History in Jewish Tradition  (Jerusalem: Keter, 2005), pp. 534–555 (Hebrew). 2. Most of Zelda’s perceptions of zoharic symbolism are mediated by Hasidism and  especially by the tales and teachings of her favorite hasidic figure, Rabbi Nachman  of Bratslav. See Aryeh Wineman, “Echoes of Bratslav Hasidism in Zelda’s Poetry,”  Shdemot, 65 (1978) (Hebrew). 3.

The expression “the heart’s thoughts” brings to mind the kabbalistic usage of the  term “wise of heart” (םכח בלה), which usually refers to the mystic. In modern terms  we might call it emotional intelligence. 18. Bialik speaks of “languages without words” In “Revealment and Concealment”  (above, note 5), p. 26. 19. Ibid., pp. 24–26. 20.

On the rendering of shoshanah as “rose” see The Zohar, transl. and commentary  by Daniel C. Matt, II (Stanford, CA: University of California Press, 2004), p. 265,  note 56 (on Zohar 1:137a). In English translations of the Bible, going back to the King  James Version, havazelet haSharon is commonly rendered “the rose of Sharon” and  shoshanat ha‘amakim as “lily of the valleys”; see, e.g., the wonderful translation of  Chana Bloch and Ariel Bloch, The Song of Songs (New York: Modern Library, 2006),  p. 55: “I am the rose of Sharon, / the wild lily of the valleys.” However, I have elected to  retain consistency between the translations of Zelda’s poems and the Zohar’s readings  of shoshanah as “rose” and havatzelet as “lily.” 36. Apart from its kabbalistic symbolism as Shekhinah (or her specific traits), the rose  is also a known mystical symbol of the perfection, beauty and holiness of the supernal  world in other mystical systems such as Gnosticism (in Christianity) and Sufism (in  Islam). The symmetric, aesthetic structure of the rose’s petals, its intoxicating fra- grance and even its erotic connotations seemed to capture the mystical experience as  a unification of the sensual with the spiritual. 37. Gershom Scholem, “Colours and Their Symbolism in Jewish Tradition and  Mysticism,” Diogenes, 108 (1979), pp. 84–85. 38. The image of the rose also relates to the bodily imagery of the woman, namely, the  womb. On this image see Abrams, Female Body (above, note 12) pp. 56–59. 39. Zelda, Shirei Zelda (above, note 16), pp. 58–59. 40. Ibid., p. 58, my translation. 41. See Bialik, “Revealment and Concealment” (above, note 5), pp. 15–16. 42. As in Bialik’s poem “Take Me under Your Wing,” the image here is of the She- khi nah as a bird, usually with white wings (due to the abundance flowing to it from  Ḥesed, mercy, which is symbolized by white). However, there is a difference between  the male speaker in Bialik’s poem, who pleads with the archetypal supernal mother to  protect him by begging her to “take me under your wing,” and the female speaker in  Zelda’s poem, who identifies with the feminine aspect of God and hence regains the  ability to thrive.
