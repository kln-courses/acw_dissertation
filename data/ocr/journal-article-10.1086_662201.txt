      <p>Chief among fascinating archaeological phenomena are sudden spreads of very distinctive material culture styles over long distances and broad areas. In the western Pacific, the spread of the Lapita “culture” (fig. 1) more than 4,000 km from the Bismarck Archipelago (Papua New Guinea) southeast into West Polynesia is such a phenomenon. This involved impressive feats of seamanship, the sudden appearance and spread in an aceramic milieu of very elaborate pottery, the long-distance transport of obsidian (up to 3,200 km), the proliferation of languages of the Austronesian family, and the colonization of previously uninhabited area. Explanatory debate has focused on the role of distinctive peoples, languages, cultures, and genes (Blust 2008; Kirch 1997; Spriggs 1997). Although the proximate motives or drivers may be unknowable (Kirch 1997:64), underlying many discussions of Lapita expansion are an implicit wave-of-advance (WOA) model (e.g., Fort 2003) and an economic driver founded on the association of food production and “Neolithic” lifeways with the appearance of Lapita (Bellwood 1978; Diamond and Bellwood 2003; Green 1979<italic>b</italic>). In Europe, evaluation of a similar Neolithic spread has matured from simple application of a WOA model (Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza 1973) through debate over the role of “indigenous” populations to consideration of more complex models of movement and cultural transmission (Zvelebil and Lillie 2000) as well as the role of sea and river transport (Davison et al. 2006). Increasingly, models of leapfrog colonization are invoked to explain archaeological and biological evidence (Zeder 2008; Zilhão 2001). Development of a similar critical appraisal of the Lapita spread has been hindered by spatial and quality gaps in the archaeological record; however, in the past decade considerable new archaeological, linguistic, and biological data have been acquired. Review of these data leads to the conclusion that a leapfrog pattern of colonization, rather than the gradualist WOA model, best fits the available evidence and helps explain many of the extraordinary characteristics of Lapita. This has important implications for the historical models often used by biologists and linguists when examining the broader Austronesian spread to which Lapita is, in part, related (e.g., Friedlaender et al. 2008; Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill 2009; Hill et al. 2007; Kayser 2010; Oppenheimer 2004), and it contributes to general consideration of the role of historical accident and serendipity in our understanding of the details of colonization processes. The Lapita spread is especially interesting because it must rank among the most challenging of Neolithic colonization movements.<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <title>Pre-Lapita and the Near Oceania Setting</title>
         <p>The Lapita cultural complex or tradition (Green 1992, 2003:109) appeared sometime shortly after 3500 (cal) BP within the Bismarck Archipelago (fig. 1), a world of mostly intervisible islands located in the center of what Irwin (1992) has called a voyaging nursery of small islands and sheltered sailing. This area extends west along the coast of New Guinea, through Island Southeast Asia to the Malay Peninsula, and north from the Philippines to Taiwan. A southern extension of this nursery reaches southeast from the vicinity of New Ireland down to Bougainville, through the Solomon Islands 1,000 km to Santa Ana off the east coast of Makira (San Cristobal). Nowhere in this region is a passage of much more than 100 km required, and generally two-way visibility between islands obtains. East of Santa Ana lies the open ocean, with a minimum passage of 350 km to the Reef/Santa Cruz Group in the Southeast Solomons. At this point, sheltered sailing and intervisibility are left behind and open-sea navigation is required. Green has labeled the region beyond this boundary “Remote Oceania” (Green 1991<italic>b</italic>), an area not settled until the Lapita period, whereas Near Oceania, to the west, has been settled, at least in part, since the Late Pleistocene. Of course, the Solomons do not form the only southern extension of this voyaging nursery, as coastal sailing along the east and south coasts of New Guinea or east from the Birds Head at the western tip of New Guinea leads to the islands of the Torres Straits, where again short hops allow passage to Australia, something accomplished in the Late Pleistocene (O’Connell and Allen 2007), when Australia and New Guinea were joined to form the continent of Sahul during glacial low-water periods.</p>
         <p>Although New Guinea and Australia were settled before 40,000 BP, the earliest dates in the Island Melanesia sector of Near Oceania indicate occupation no later than 39,500 (uncal) BP (Leavesley and Chappell 2004) when people had managed to cross the Bismarck Archipelago (fig. 2) to New Ireland. Presumably, from this time people were capable of crossing from New Ireland to Buka, which formed, during Late Pleistocene low-water periods, the northwestern end of Greater Bougainville (or Bukida), which joined the islands of Buka, Bougainville, Choiseul, Santa Isabel, and the Florida Group, enabling people to walk 750 km to the edge of a very narrow passage (&lt;1 km) across to Guadalcanal. Evidence that people did this is, however, slight. The oldest dates from the Solomon Islands are from Kilu cave on Buka (Wickler 2001), at the northern end of Greater Bougainville. This site dates back to circa 32,000 BP (Wickler 2001:68).<sup>1</sup> There are no other Pleistocene-age dates from the Solomon Islands, and the next-oldest date is mid-Holocene, at the site of Vatuluma Posovi on Guadalcanal, where Roe (1993) has a date of circa 6000 BP<sup>2</sup> on remnant deposits at the base of a rockshelter. Surface finds of waisted axes on Guadalcanal, similar to those of Pleistocene age from the Huon Peninsula in Papua New Guinea, have been discounted by Specht (2005) as dating, in the Solomons, from the comparatively recent past. The distribution of surface finds of obsidian stemmed tools, dated in excavated contexts by tephrachronology, and distinctive mortars argued to be of mid-Holocene age extends through the Bismarcks to Bougainville, suggesting interaction throughout this area, but as yet they do not appear to be recorded farther to the southeast in the Solomons (Torrence and Swadling 2008). Perhaps the strongest evidence for early occupation of the Solomons south of Buka is provided by linguistics. Although most of the modern languages of the Solomons and the Bismarcks are Austronesian and are generally assumed to correlate with the Lapita phenomenon, a scattering of non-Austronesian (NAN) languages are found from New Britain as far south as the tiny island of Savo off the north coast of Guadalcanal. Although these have been referred to as East Papuan, in fact they differ so much among themselves that linguists have found it very difficult to relate them to one another (Ross 2001). Recently, Dunn et al. (2005) have applied phylogenetic techniques to the study of these languages and have argued that they form a group that broke up as much as 10,000 years ago. Although there has been critique of their methods (Donohue and Musgrave 2007; Dunn et al. 2007), it remains true that there is considerable diversity among these languages, which can be easily explained only by divergence over a considerable period of time, suggesting occupation of all of Near Oceania by NAN speakers by the Early Holocene.<fig id="fg2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>There is no archaeological evidence of pre-Lapita occupation of Remote Oceania (Green 1988; Sand 1995; Spriggs 1997). There are also no NAN languages beyond Savo in the central Solomons. What have been described as mixed languages in the Reef/Santa Cruz Group in Remote Oceania, just across the Near/Remote Oceania boundary, were argued to have NAN admixture; however, recent close analysis of these languages (Äiwoo on the Reef Islands) concludes they are Austronesian (Dunn et al. 2007; Ross and Næss 2007). Similarly, the suggestion that the high degree of variability in the Austronesian languages of Southern Melanesia (Vanuatu, New Caledonia) is a function of interaction with NAN speakers (Blust 2005, 2008) is debated (Donohue and Denham 2008; Pawley 2006).</p>
         <p>The Pleistocene inhabitants of Near Oceania were foragers living a mobile, low-density lifestyle, but there is evidence, beginning in the Pleistocene, of food-resource management and the early importance of species that came to form the subsistence base with the advent of food production. Although the marine resources of the region are considerable and were exploited, it was not until the mid-Holocene that the modern lagoons and reefs were established and stabilized, as sea levels returned to current levels (Specht 2005:251–252). Many coastlines would have been inhospitable rocky shores until that time (Terrell 2002). The tropical rainforests were relatively resource poor for hunter-gatherers, and that might have led to attempts to manage and enrich the environment by transporting food plants and animals from mainland New Guinea into the Bismarck Archipelago. This included the introduction of the Pacific almond (<italic>Canarium</italic>), possibly by 23,000 BP<sup>3</sup> at Kilu on Buka but dated confidently as a tree crop on Manus by 14,000 BP (Specht 2005:267; Yen 1996); the cuscus (<italic>Phalanger orientalis</italic>), from 23,500 BP into New Ireland; the bandicoot (<italic>Echymipera kalubu</italic>), after 13,000 BP into Manus; and the northern pademelon (<italic>Thylogale browni</italic>), about 8400 BP into New Ireland (all dates calibrated following Specht 2005 and White 2004). Although appearance of these and other animals (e.g., <italic>Rattus</italic> spp.; White, Clark, and Bedford 2000) in the archaeological record have been widely interpreted as evidence of translocation of species, Specht (2005:256) cautions against such interpretations in the absence of good data on the indigenous fauna of the region. The patchy distribution of some of these species across the islands suggests that even if they were introduced, their presence was not important enough to ensure widespread distribution (Specht 2005:259). Evidence from starch grains and phytoliths on stone tools indicates the importance of plant foods in the diet, in particular tubers, which ultimately formed the core domesticates in the region. There is evidence for taro use as early as 28,700–20,100 BP at Kilu Cave on Buka (<italic>Colocasia esculenta</italic>, <italic>Alocasia macrorrhiza</italic>), and although there is no evidence for domesticated taro (something hard to determine from starch grains) in the Bismarck Archipelago, there is increasing evidence for cultivation of taro and other crops in Highland New Guinea by the mid-Holocene (Denham and Haberle 2008; Fullagar et al. 2006).</p>
         <p>If accepted, the introduction of these plants and animals attests to considerable potential mobility by the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene, something that is securely demonstrated by the transport of obsidian from sources in New Britain and the Admiralty Islands. Obsidian was commonly used for stone tool production within the Bismarck Archipelago, and by 20,000 BP obsidian from the Talasea and Mopir regions of New Britain is found in some quantity in New Ireland, a straight-line distance of 320 km from the sources and a minimum 15-km water crossing via the Duke of York Islands (Summerhayes and Allen 1993). In the Admiralty Group, the small source islands of Pam Lin and Lou provided obsidian to sites on neighboring Manus (Fredericksen 1997), requiring a minimum sea passage of 25 km. However, no obsidian moved out of this group until the Lapita period (Summerhayes 2004), suggesting that the long sea passage (&gt;350 km) to its neighbors may have limited movement or that there was no need for such long-distance interactions among these hunter-gatherer populations. Although the movements of obsidian across the sea to New Ireland are dramatic, a more common situation may be reflected by the data from the open site of Kapona na Dari (Torrence et al. 2004), which dates to 40,000–20,000 years ago (luminescence dates). Located at the base of the Willaumez Peninsula, the site contains obsidian from all the geochemical source groups of New Britain, indicating numerous two-day trips north and south of the site by people well versed in the distribution of useful stone resources. Our understanding of obsidian movement and patterns of shared culture in the Early and mid-Holocene is limited by the poor quality of the archaeological record; however, the find-spot distribution of distinctive stemmed obsidian tools and styles of mortars and pestles dating to this period (Torrence and Swadling 2008) indicates broad zones of shared culture within and extending beyond the Bismarck Archipelago. Although this reflects some degree of social interaction, it may simply illustrate the slow diffusion of technologies and styles over many thousands of years, creating regional traditions.</p>
         <p>In summary, the Lapita phenomenon appeared suddenly in the central Bismarck Archipelago among populations that had adapted to that environment for more than 25,000 years. These people were foragers whom we assume to have lived at low densities, possibly focused on resource concentrations along the coast but also venturing far into the interior of the large islands, such as New Britain (Pavlides and Gosden 1994; Summerhayes 2007<italic>a</italic>:11–12). They were dependent on wild foods, but these included most of the plants, both tree and root crops, that as domesticates have been the basis of subsistence into the recent past. As foragers, these people were of necessity mobile, and their crossing of numerous water gaps indicates considerable marine-transport capability, developed over thousands of years. The distribution of obsidian from sources to distant sites demonstrates relatively routine movements across passages of up to 15–25 km as well as a widespread knowledge of stone resources. Torrence and Swadling (2008) argue that the distributions of stone tools and distinctive mortars and pestles reflect social networks that were precursors of those developed or enhanced in the Lapita period. It could also be argued that the precursors or preadaptations of the Lapita maritime sailing capability and subsistence base were also in existence. All that was needed was a trigger to, as Torrence and Swadling (2008:600) put it, “light up” the system in a flash of cultural expansion that greatly magnified all precursors.</p>

         <title>Extraordinary Lapita</title>
         <p>Like many similar horizon spreads, Lapita is marked by a series of extraordinary features, in both material culture and behavior. The Lapita cultural complex (Green 2003:109) is marked by the sudden appearance in the Bismarck Archipelago of elaborately formed and decorated pottery in a previously aceramic region (Kirch 2001<italic>b</italic>:85). Although an apparently related ceramic technology and material culture is found some 2,000 km to the west in the islands of Wallacea, the very distinctive decorative ceramic style that is the hallmark of Lapita originated in the Bismarcks (Kirch 1997:52). Lapita is also marked and was conceivably catalyzed, possibly within a few generations, by rapid expansion into Remote Oceania (i.e., Oceania east of the main Solomon Islands; Green 2003:106), breaking the limits of previous colonization of the Oceanic world. This involved feats of seamanship unprecedented in world history, including the maintenance of ongoing spatial interaction over distances of more than 2,000 km, as evidenced by transport of obsidian.</p>
         <p>Figure 3 plots the ages of the earliest Lapita occupations across the western Pacific.<sup>4</sup> These begin with sites in the westernmost Mussau Islands of the Bismarcks (Kirch 2001<italic>a</italic>:205), followed by slightly later ages for other island groups of that archipelago. In Remote Oceania, the earliest radiocarbon ages have come from the Reef/Santa Cruz Group; that from the SE-SZ-8 Nanggu site on Santa Cruz has been argued to be the oldest (Green, Jones, and Sheppard 2008; Jones et al. 2007), although new Δ<italic>R</italic> values<sup>5</sup> for correction of marine-shell dates in the Reef/Santa Cruz Group (Petchey et al. 2008) have made them, in general, age penecontemporary with those from northern and central Vanuatu (Bedford, Spriggs, and Regenvanu 2006; Galipaud and Swete Kelly 2007<italic>a</italic>). The earliest dates from New Caledonia begin with one from the original Lapita site itself (Sand 2000), while for the Fijian group a basal date derives from the site of Bourewa on the southwestern coast of Viti Levu (table 2 in Nunn 2007). While these landfall dates from Vanuatu and New Caledonia to Fiji are statistically contemporaneous, that for Tongatapu, in the Tongan group, suggests that its settlement may have been slightly later (Burley and Dickinson 2001, 2010), a viewpoint supported by later dates for sites in the Vava’u Islands to the north (Burley and Connaughton 2007). This summation of radiocarbon dating allows no more than 250 years for the formation and dispersal of the Lapita tradition. In Remote Oceania this spread was extremely rapid, so much so that even with some slope in the rate of spread from the Reef/Santa Cruz Group to Tonga, it permits no pauses to fully populate any of the large island groups.<fig id="fg3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Within almost a radiocarbon instant, a unified ceramic tradition (fig. 4) spread over 4,000 km—one-tenth of the circumference of the earth—from New Guinea to Samoa. This represents the transport of a production technology, decorative techniques—which include not just fine dentate stamping but incision, appliqué, and punctation—and an elaborate decorative system composed of sets of distinctive motifs applied to a wide variety of pot forms. As almost all of this material is locally made or, in the absence of clay, derives from communities on nearby islands (Dickinson 2006), the ceramics involve reproduction in the new lands of this complex cultural system and not simply transport of heirlooms.<fig id="fg4" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         </p>
         <p>Why this elaborate ceramic tradition, requiring considerable skilled labor and time investment in pot construction and decoration, was maintained and reproduced by colonizers of Remote Oceania remains a puzzle. Whatever the reason, it would appear that it materialized something fundamental to Lapita society that needed to be reproduced by small colonizing populations. Some insight into the function of the design system may be given by the emphasis on anthropomorphic motifs, including face motifs of a variety of forms (Chiu 2007; Spriggs 1990). Combined with the suggestion (Green 1979<italic>a</italic>; Kirch 1997) that the dentate stamping and incising represented tattooing of the pots, this indicates that they may have played a role in an ancestor cult. The activity of tattooing/decorating, along with more recent evidence of overpainting and covering of dentate designs (Bedford 2006), suggests that the pots were actively involved in some form of ongoing system, wherein the making of the pots and designs may have been more significant than some form of meaning directly signaled by distinctive designs. Most recently, the relationship with ancestors has been strengthened by the association of large decorated pots with burials, wherein skulls were manipulated, at the early Lapita Teouma cemetery site in Vanuatu (Bedford, Spriggs, and Regenvanu 2006).</p>
         <p>This elaborate tradition did not remain cohesive. Within a few hundred years, the fine dentate stamping and elaborate pot forms characteristic of the early sites were replaced in a process of rapid simplification of form and decorative technique (Clark and Murray 2006; Green 1979<italic>b</italic>). Ultimately, ceramic manufacture disappeared from much of the archaeological record of Near and Remote Oceania (Samoa, Tonga, Wallis/Futuna, central Vanuatu, the Southeast Solomons, the Western Solomons, and much of the Bismarck Archipelago; Spriggs 1997). It seems probable that the rate of simplification, at least in some areas (Sand 2007:217), was faster in Remote Oceania than in the Bismarck Archipelago (Summerhayes 2007<italic>b</italic>:152), so that the dentate stamp/elaborate pot form system ended in some West Polynesian sites in a few generations. This suggests a close association between this system and a decline in its utility following initial events of colonization (Kirch 1988<italic>a</italic>; Sheppard 1993).</p>
         <p>A third extraordinary aspect of Lapita is the long-distance movement of obsidian. Obsidian from local sources was used and transported around the Bismarcks before Lapita; however, the amounts and distances rose dramatically with Lapita (Specht 2002; Summerhayes 2004). In the Lapita period, Bismarck obsidian spread in small amounts west to Sabah, Malaysia, and east to Fiji and New Caledonia, covering a total range of 6,500 km. Although Lapita obsidian is often described as indicative of some long-distance trade/exchange network, there is little basis for arguing anything other than direct-access procurement and heirloom effect. The amounts of obsidian transported and the variety of sources are best seen as an index of movement and interaction.</p>
         <p>Consequently, no model of simple decline with distance applies. Sites in the Reef/Santa Cruz Group more than 2,000 km from the source have comparatively large amounts of Bismarcks obsidian (SZ-8, 287 pieces; RF-2, 644; RF-6, 29); while sites slightly farther out, including those in Vanuatu, have little to none (&lt;60 pieces per site in northern and central Vanuatu [Galipaud and Swete Kelly 2007<italic>a</italic>], &lt;10 [total] in New Caledonia and Fiji, and none in Tonga). Specht (2002) has estimated that the combined amounts for 12 recorded Lapita sites in the Reef/Santa Cruz Group could be 845–1125 kg. These sites also contain a striking variety of obsidian sources. Of the 972 samples from the Reef/Santa Cruz sites sourced by Green (1987), most (97.5%) are from Talasea on the Willaumez Peninsula of New Britain, while small amounts are from the Admiralties (1.13%), in the northwest of the Bismarcks, and also from Vanua Lava (1.23%), in the Banks Islands of Vanuatu. One piece is from West Fergusson, off the coast of New Guinea in the D’Entrecasteaux Group (Green and Bird 1989; Sheppard, Trichereau, and Milicich 2010). These are thus the most diverse Lapita sites, with four sources representing a web of connections back into the Bismarcks, south into Remote Oceania, and across the Coral Sea to New Guinea. The presence of small amounts of obsidian from the nearby Banks Islands indicates that the obsidian was not simply linked to connections back to a “homeland” in the west. Although the Banks Islands volcanic glass is of comparatively poor quality, it would be suitable for the simple cutting tasks to which obsidian was put in Lapita sites, yet it remains a minor component in Lapita obsidian assemblages of Remote Oceania, even those in Vanuatu. There is no evidence of obsidian reuse in the Reef/Santa Cruz sites (Sheppard 1993); thus, the amount of Bismarcks obsidian implies strong ongoing connections back to the homeland and, given the dominance of New Britain material, into the Willaumez Peninsula region.</p>
         <sec id="sc2.1">
            <title>Models of Lapita Expansion</title>
            <p>Models of migration proposed by Anthony (1990) and Moore (2001) are routinely cited in the Lapita literature (e.g., Green 2003; Kirch 1997); however, additional characteristics have to be taken into account to provide for variants used by biologists and linguists interested in Pacific colonization. Although there are a bewildering variety of named models or scenarios (see review by Green 2003), most are based on permutations of a small number of parameters. These include (1) demographic viability, (2) directionality, (3) speed of migration, and (4) the nature of the natural and cultural environment at the destination. The simplest model is the wave of advance (WOA), as originally proposed by Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza (1973). This model is founded on colonization as a function of demic diffusion or demographic growth and short-distance, slow movement expanding out into suitable social and physical environments without any particular directional bias. Underlying this model is an economic driver whereby demographic growth is fueled by either improved access to resources or new food-producing technologies (e.g., Paleoindian occupation of the Americas or Neolithic expansion into Europe). Expected outcomes of this model are (1) continuous cultural distributions, (2) temporal clines, (3) nondirectional expansion into equivalent environments, and (4) considerable biological and cultural interaction with previous inhabitants, if present. In the Pacific variants of this model (e.g., Fort 2003; Kayser 2010; Oppenheimer 2004), much attention has been paid to speed of movement, giving rise to “express-train” and “slow-boat” versions. Speed is assumed to correlate with degree of interaction with previous inhabitants, which would have important implications for the genetic record. Archaeologically, this is also entangled with questions of the rise of the Lapita archaeological tradition and whether Lapita was introduced into the Bismarck Archipelago or developed in situ (Allen 1984). Green has proposed an intermediate scenario that describes Lapita as developing from external intrusion, local innovation, and ultimate integration (Green 1991<italic>a</italic>). Ultimately, in Oceania the Lapita expansion is seen as part of a WOA fueled by innovation in maritime technology and development of food production based on domestic animals and tubers. Variation in rates of spread or “pulse-pause” patterns are seen as related to the limitations of new innovations driving expansion or pulse events (e.g., Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill 2009).</p>
            <p>Most recently, a variant of the demic model, the ideal free distribution, which attempts to operationalize the model by using the principles of human behavioral ecology, has been proposed for the study of colonization in Oceania (Kennett, Anderson, and Winterhalder 2006). The major difference between this model and earlier formulations is an attempt to take into account mode of subsistence, new-habitat suitability, and population density in predicting migratory behavior. Therefore, not all habitats are of equal value, making it possible to predict leapfrog-type behavior to reach high-quality habitats. This model is still founded on demographic growth and predicts some population increase until habitat-quality differentials develop triggering dispersal. The Kennett, Anderson, and Winterhalder (2006) model for Oceania predicts episodic periods of dispersal/migration followed by population growth, with the key variable mode of subsistence determining population growth and effect on habitat quality. Faster movement is predicted by foraging-type subsistence behavior in the relatively depauperate natural environments of Remote Oceania.</p>
            <p>Speed of advance is, of course, related to transport capability. In the Island Pacific, migration involves watercraft and island hopping, although settlement of large islands under the WOA model would take some time (e.g., New Caledonia is 400 km long, with an area of 19,000 km<sup>2</sup>; Bougainville is 200 km long, with an area of 9318 km<sup>2</sup>). If, however, all islands along a front are colonized in sequence, then there is ultimately little difference from continental models, as movement requires the filling of available equivalent landscapes before expansion. Leapfrog models differ from WOA models in that they involve bypassing potential settlement areas to establish outposts in uninhabited land or enclaves in previously inhabited areas. Repeated moves of this kind might result in a string-of-pearls pattern, joining settlements in favorable environments, which Moore (2001) suggests is both a very successful strategy from a demographic perspective and possibly predicted by the ideal-free-distribution model. Such models, however, are dependent on significant founding populations or regular contact with parent or neighboring populations to buffer demographic variation. The implications of the leapfrog model depend on the size of the leaps and whether there is backfilling from colonization events. If the leaps are small, perhaps to the next high-quality habitat, then as Bar-Yosef (2002) argues, the difference between WOA and leapfrog, or saltation, models may simply be one of scale. If, however, the distance is large and crosses inhabited areas, then we would expect to see significant cultural and biological disjuncture, with implications for the genetic, linguistic, and archaeological record. If the leapfrog movement is large and into uninhabited territory, we would see a founder effect, creating cultural and biological homogeneity in the new area. If the leapfrog strategy was repeated, as under the string-of-pearls scenario, we would see cultural homogeneity over wide areas appearing in a very short period of time.</p>

            <title>Lapita Expansion</title>
            <p>Figure 1 shows the known distribution of Lapita sites and a representation of a wave-of-advance model. Contrary to what we might expect, the Lapita distribution is highly directional (Irwin 2008). If settlement was driven by the need for new land by new food-producing populations, then given settlement success in the Bismarcks, we would expect to see the coast and coastal islands of Papua New Guinea occupied long before any move to the south and east. The only dentate ceramic material reported from mainland New Guinea consists of two sherds from the north coast (Summerhayes and Allen 2007:98). Nothing has been recovered from the New Guinea coast across the Vitiaz Strait or, with the exception of Lapita sherds at one late Lapita site on Tuam in the Siassi group (Lilley 2004; Spriggs 1997:118; Summerhayes 2007<italic>b</italic>), from the set of offshore islands that extends north along that coast. Similarly, on Manus only a handful of Lapita sherds have been recovered from three possibly late Lapita sites (Ambrose 1991; Spriggs 1997:112), leading Summerhayes (2007<italic>b</italic>:169) to question the extent of Lapita occupation of that area. On the south coast of Papua New Guinea, no Lapita sites are reported, although there is a later Early Papuan Pottery (EPP) horizon that, as a colonization event, has many similarities with Lapita and is believed to correlate with the spread of Austronesian speakers considered to be Lapita descendants. The only other direct Lapita connection is a piece of Fergusson Island obsidian recovered from the RF-2 Site in the Reef/Santa Cruz Group (Green and Bird 1989). In a review of the south-coast sequence, Summerhayes and Allen (2007) did not completely rule out the possibility of yet-to-be-discovered Lapita sites in that area, but they concluded that the amount of research already conducted in the Massim made it unlikely. The recent finding of “red slip” pottery in the Torres Straits, argued to date to 2400–2600 BP, may suggest earlier intrusion into this area (McNiven et al. 2006), as does the discovery of plain ceramics on Wari Island in the Massim region, which may date to the same time period (Negishi and Ono 2009). Similarly, the finding of an anomalous temper in late Lapita ceramics in Roviana Lagoon in the Western Solomons, possibly derived from granitic contexts in New Guinea or Australia, argues for contact across the Coral Sea (Felgate 2003; Felgate and Dickinson 1998). Although Clark and Bedford (2008:70) imply that these facts indicate an as-yet-unknown Lapita occupation of the east New Guinea coast, which would have the known EPP tradition at its end, Summerhayes and Allen (2007; see also Irwin and Holdaway 1996) have demonstrated that the latter has all the hallmarks of a colonization event, like that of early Lapita but substantially later. At the moment, the data suggest that any Lapita movement along the New Guinea coast may at best be contemporaneous with the late Lapita movement into the Western Solomon Islands.</p>
            <p>The clear direction of early Lapita expansion is to the southeast, along the axis of the Solomon Islands, with a later radiation into southern Island Melanesia and western Polynesia. A wave-of-advance model would predict considerable Lapita settlement of the many islands and lagoons of the main Solomons, where there is no shortage of the locations favored in the Bismarcks. There are, however, no early Lapita settlements known from the region extending from Bougainville to the end of the main Solomons (Sheppard and Walter 2006). Although the possibility of a gap in settlement has been raised (Roe 1993), it has generally been balanced by the suggestion that the gap represents a knowledge gap (Kirch 1997:53; Spriggs 1997:128) and that sites would ultimately be found (Green 1979<italic>b</italic>). In fact, although members of the Southeast Solomons Culture History project (Green and Cresswell 1976) failed to find Lapita sites in the areas of Near Oceania that they surveyed in the eastern Solomon Islands (Ulawa, Makira, Santa Ana, and Ugi), it was their discovery of materials from the main Solomons, especially chert in the early Lapita sites of the Reef/Santa Cruz Group in Remote Oceania (Sheppard 1993, 1996), that strengthened the argument for an as-yet-unknown main-Solomons settlement and led Green (1979<italic>b</italic>, his fig. 2.12) to propose such locations in Marau Sound in eastern Guadalcanal and in the New Georgia Group of the Western Solomons. Although such settlement made sense under a wave-of-advance model, early Lapita sites have not been found, despite what can be argued to be amounts of research at least comparable to that expended elsewhere before the discovery of Lapita deposits. This has led Sheppard and Walter (2006) to propose a revised model of Solomon Island prehistory that incorporates an early Lapita leapfrog across the main Solomons into Remote Oceania followed by a significant late Lapita appearance in the Western Solomons. Critique of this proposal has reiterated the need for more research and emphasized the need to consider the geomorphic context of the Lapita record and its preservation (Clark and Bedford 2008; Felgate 2003, 2007).</p>
            <p>Before turning to a review of recent evidence from biology, linguistics, and archaeology in an evaluation of the Solomons leapfrog proposal, it is important to note that the accepted archaeological evidence based on chronology, amounts of obsidian in the Reef/Santa Cruz Group, and the cohesiveness of the early Lapita ceramic corpus is much more supportive of leapfrogs than of wave-of-advance models (see also Kirch 1997:64). The evidence from Remote Oceania indicates that Lapita colonizers were accustomed to making long moves away from neighbors, and although the 2,000 km from the Bismarcks to the Reef/Santa Cruz Group is a very long leap, sailing is guided along the Solomons as far as Makira or Ulawa. In addition, although we have evidence of Lapita contact with the Solomons and potentially with the southern Papuan coast, the known archaeological sequence from the main Solomons is in many respects similar to the known sequence from the southern Papuan coast, with a late Lapita or Austronesian incursion creating a distinctive regional tradition well after the initial Lapita pulse out of the Bismarck Archipelago. To summarize, the currently available archaeological evidence (fig. 2) indicates (1) a leapfrog colonization of Remote Oceania out of the Bismarck Archipelago by 3200 BP, (2) late Lapita settlement of the Western Solomons circa 2600 BP, and (3) late or post-Lapita settlement of the southern Papuan coast circa 2400–2800(?) BP. Although the proposed archaeological picture may simply represent gaps in data, it also has implications for linguistic and biological data as well as for models of archaeological visibility. These implications will be developed and used to evaluate that picture in the next section.</p>

         <title>Evaluation of the Models</title>
         <sec id="sc3.1">
            <title>Linguistic Evidence</title>
            <p>Linguistic data indicate that speakers of Proto-Austronesian originated in East or Southeast Asia, perhaps some 5,000–6,000 years ago (Pawley and Ross 1993). Most recently, Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill (2009), using a phylogenetic approach, have replicated the standard historical linguistic model and placed the origin of Austronesian in Taiwan circa 5230 BP. It is argued that the spread of Austronesian, by either migration of speakers or language shift, was fueled by development of agriculture and Neolithic technology (Bellwood 1991; Diamond and Bellwood 2003), although this association has been challenged, most recently by Donohue and Denham (2010). A prehistoric association between language, material culture, and biology is very hard to determine. In Near and Remote Oceania, the association between language and material culture, as recovered by archaeology, is supported by the fact that in Remote Oceania Lapita is the founding culture and that only Austronesian languages are spoken, providing a near-perfect association (Green 1991<italic>b</italic>), at least in that region. A possible exception has been the languages of the Reef/Santa Cruz Group, to which I return below.</p>
            <p>The linguistic expectation for a wave-of-advance model of Austronesian spread out of the Bismarck Archipelago into Remote Oceania would, following the principles outlined by Ross (1997), be the formation of an innovation-linked subgroup of languages extending from the homeland in the Bismarcks southeast into Remote Oceania. Early breakage of the linkages might occur where geographical barriers to ongoing communication existed (Ross 1997:226). In Near and Remote Oceania, significant sea gaps (lacking intervisibility) should correlate with early linkage breaking. Therefore, early breaks should occur in the Buka–New Ireland gap, the Southeast Solomons–Reef/Santa Cruz/Vanikoro/Utupua (Near-Remote Oceania) gap, the Reef/Santa Cruz/Utupua–Vanuatu gap, the Vanuatu–New Caledonia gap, and the Vanuatu-Fiji gap. Over time, linkage breakage would develop at less significant barriers to interaction. The resulting distribution of languages should show a fairly clear pattern of relationship from west to east, with major distinctions at these gaps. Subsequent history of migrations and language replacement or interaction with NAN populations might complicate this picture; however, it should be rare for all traces of earlier language substrates to be obliterated.</p>
            <p>A leapfrog model would differ from a wave of advance in that it would create much more disjuncture in linguistic distribution, potentially create founder effects, and minimize the degree of interaction with preexisting populations. There should be no necessary close relationships between neighboring languages, and if leapfrogs occurred from a linguistically variable homeland, unexpected variety might be generated in the destination region. Given the Solomons leapfrog model, we would expect (1) no simple west-to-east pattern of language relationships, (2) high-order relationships between the Bismarck Archipelago and Remote Oceania, and (3) potentially complex relationships within Remote Oceania, all occurring as a result of distinct founder effects.</p>
            <p>Figure 5 represents some general relationships and characteristics of the languages of Island Melanesia. One characteristic shared by all of these languages is remarkable linguistic diversity, with many languages per island or island group. This contrasts remarkably with the situation in Polynesia, where there is a one-to-one relationship between island groups and languages (Pawley 1981). Whatever the drivers behind the development of this pattern, they would appear to be similar throughout the region. Apart from this general similarity, there is considerable variation across the area, with major disjuncture in language geography. The Austronesian languages of this region are all members of the Oceanic subgrouping of Austronesian. Ross (1988) argues for two high-order divisions of Oceanic: Western Oceanic, derived from a dialect linkage, and an Admiralties group. Lynch, Ross, and Crowley (2002:94) add a third division, called Central/Eastern Oceanic, that includes almost all other areas of Oceania in a poorly defined grouping. Western Oceanic includes Meso-Melanesian, which incorporates the Austronesian languages of northern New Britain east of and including the Willaumez Peninsula, the Bali-Vitu group, New Ireland, and the northern and western Solomons down to Santa Isabel (Lynch, Ross, and Crowley 2002:101; Pawley and Ross 1993:439). The origin of this subgroup is considered to be in the Willaumez Peninsula area. The Austronesian languages of the St. Matthias Group (Mussau) appear to form a separate high-order subgrouping that has affinities to the Admiralties but is not part of that group (Lynch, Ross, and Crowley 2002:96).<fig id="fg5" position="float" fig-type="figure">

            </p>
            <p>Western Oceanic and the Meso-Melanesian subgroup end at the eastern end of Santa Isabel in the central Solomons, where it abuts Southeast Solomonic, which includes all the remaining languages in the main Solomons to the east. This boundary is marked by the Tryon-Hackman line, which denotes a very sharp high-order linguistic break (Ross 1988; Sheppard and Walter 2006): all languages to the east of this point belong to the Central/Eastern Oceanic grouping of Lynch, Ross, and Crowley (2002). Although the geographical and archaeological boundary of Near and Remote Oceania is found at the end of the main Solomons, the equivalent linguistic divide apparently occurs, following Lynch, Ross, and Crowley (2002), at the Tryon-Hackman line. The Southeast Solomonic languages are very conservative. This distinguishes them from language groups to either side and in particular from other languages of Central/Eastern Oceanic in Island Melanesia, which Pawley (2006) describes as highly “aberrant.” Lynch, Ross, and Crowley (2002:112) divide the latter into a large Southern Linkage, which includes the languages of Vanuatu and New Caledonia, and the very diverse languages (six) of Utupua and Vanikoro, which they propose constitute one or two first-order divisions of Central/Eastern Oceanic.</p>
            <p>Linguists generally propose a wave-of-advance or equivalent model to explain the distribution of Austronesian languages southeast from the Bismarck Archipelago and explain deviations from expectation as a function of subsequent history. If our application of the spread zone is correct, then the CEOc (Central/Eastern Oceanic) languages represent the original eastward spread of Oceanic languages, first forming a dialect chain and then breaking up into a linkage. The WOc (Western Oceanic) linkage, on the other hand, represents a later spread that, at least in its eastern portion (New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, and the western Solomons) overlaid earlier CEOc languages. The eastern extent of this overlay accounts for the rather sharp boundary between WOc and CEOc in the central Solomons (Ross 1988:382–385, 1989). The fact that the CEOc languages apparently form a linkage, rather than a neatly branching tree, suggests that Oceanic speakers moved across the central and eastern Pacific rather rapidly (Pawley 1981): there were no pauses of sufficient length to allow much linguistic innovation to take place before movement continued (Lynch, Ross, and Crowley 2002:97–98).</p>
            <p>Therefore, CEOc is proposed to have arisen in the Bismarcks and to have spread with, or at the time of, Lapita through the Solomon Islands and on through Remote Oceania. The problem raised by the Tryon-Hackman line is explained by portraying WOc and the Meso-Melanesian linkage as a later (post-Lapita?) spread through the northern and western Solomons that completely replaced all earlier Austronesian languages. The linguistic evidence for an earlier CEOc spread in this region is apparently very slight (Ross 1988:383–384), leading even Ross to question the scenario. The next aberration is the conservative Southeast Solomonic subgroup. Pawley (2006) has suggested that the relative lack of diversity in this region is the result of limited interaction with NAN populations in the central Solomons, as opposed to high levels of interaction in the western Solomons. Although there are more NAN languages surviving in the area of the Meso-Melanesian linkage, their distribution continues into the central Solomons. Savo lies 12 km off the northwest coast of Guadalcanal and the Russell Group 40 km to the west. Both are occupied solely by NAN speakers and have histories of interaction with Austronesian speakers (Terrill 2003) of Southeast Solomonic. It does not seem reasonable to think that the area occupied by Southeast Solomonic was originally unoccupied by NAN speakers. In fact, Guadalcanal is the only area with archaeological remains dating to the mid-Holocene, demonstrating the presence of pre–Lapita period people, if not what language they spoke.</p>
            <p>If Southeast Solomonic represents back-movement from farther east in Remote Oceania, as has been tentatively proposed by Sheppard and Walter (2006), it is apparently not easily related to the languages of that region. They are highly variable, and it has been proposed that their variability could be caused, in part, by interaction with NAN speakers (Blust 2005); however, there is no archaeological evidence of pre-Lapita settlement of the region (Green 1988) associated with NAN speakers. More recently, Blust (2008) has proposed that an early Austronesian colonization of Vanuatu was quickly followed by a second wave of NAN speakers who gradually adopted Austronesian from the early colonizers. This second-migration hypothesis has some antiquity in archaeology (Spriggs 1997) as a mechanism to ultimately explain the biological and cultural differences across the Melanesia/Polynesia boundary. The archaeological basis for this has steadily weakened, leading Bedford and Spriggs (2008:112–113) to recently conclude that “these multiple traditions do not provide evidence of waves of secondary migration or high levels of sustained interaction” (see also Reepmeyer and Clark 2009). The only other area where NAN occupation has been proposed is in the Reef/Santa Cruz Group, where three languages have been interpreted as mixtures of Austronesian and NAN (Mühlhäusler et al. 1996). Recently, Ross and Næss (2007) have closely examined the languages of the Reef/Santa Cruz Group and concluded that there is no evidence for NAN influence and that Äiwoo and the other languages of that region are part of an Utupua-Vanikoro group, which together they describe as the Temotu group, representing a first-order subgroup of Oceanic. Ross and Næss’s conclusion is also supported by recent phylogenetic analysis of all Solomons NAN languages (Dunn et al. 2007). Temotu cannot be related to its neighbors to the east or to the west in the Solomons and has its closest ties with the languages of the St. Matthias Group (Mussau, Tench), in the Bismarcks north of New Ireland. This is indicative of a significant leapfrog and leads Ross and Næss (2007:461) to state that “if the Temotu languages form a primary subgroup, then this suggests that the arrival of their ancestors was separate from the arrivals of either the Southeast or Northwest Solomonic Groups in the areas they currently occupy.”</p>
            <p>The most recent contribution to the study of relationships among Austronesian languages is the work of Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill (2009), who have used lexical data and phylogenetic analysis to construct a phylogeny of 400 Austronesian languages. In the region of interest, their results support, for the most part, those of the comparative linguistic method as discussed above (supplementary online material 5 in Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill 2009). The Temotu subgroup is strongly supported and joins the phylogenetic tree at the same level as the groupings of Southeast Solomonic/Meso-Melanesian, North and South Vanuatu/New Caledonia, and Polynesian/East Polynesian/Micronesian, implying a first-order division created before the divergence of these groups (fig. 1 in Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill 2009). However, the St. Matthias (Mussau) subgroup is not supported, and Mussau and Vitu (65 km northwest of the Willaumez Peninsula) form distinct outliers in the large Meso-Melanesian group. Both of these conservative languages are from small, isolated island groups that have possibly experienced comparatively limited interaction with neighbors since the Austronesian expansion in the region.</p>
            <p>In summary, there is very little linguistic evidence to support a wave-of-advance model of Austronesian expansion through the Solomons into the Pacific. Instead we see considerable variation and radical disjuncture in the linguistic geography. Of course, this could be explained by a complex linguistic history, following the proposed Lapita-associated spread of CEOc (Lynch, Ross, and Crowley 2002). These arguments invoke the complete replacement of early CEOc in the northern and Western Solomons, with only limited traces remaining (Ross 1988), and an absence of Austronesian-NAN interaction in the central and eastern Solomons, where there are extant NAN languages and evidence of pre–Lapita period populations. Finally, in Remote Oceania, the explanation of “aberrant,” highly variable languages in Southern Melanesia requires reference to Austronesian interactions with preexisting or significant secondary migrations of NAN populations (Blust 2005, 2008; Donohue and Denham 2008) in a region where there is no evidence for pre-Lapita settlement or archaeological support for secondary migration. The work of Ross and Næss (2007), recently supported by Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill (2009), points directly to at least one leapfrog out into Remote Oceania, and Pawley suggests that the variability in Remote Oceania was a function of repeated direct movements from the Bismarcks: “As movements of Lapita peoples from Northwest Melanesia to Southeast Melanesia continued over the next few generations it may be that canoes carrying mixed[-language] populations came to predominate” (Pawley 2006:248). Leapfrog movement from a diverse homeland region, such as the Bismarck Archipelago, allows for the generation of diversity in the populations settling the new islands, something not easily accommodated in a wave-of-advance model.</p>

            <title>Genetic Evidence</title>
            <p>Study of the genetic structure of Pacific populations has exploded in recent years, with considerable literature on the evidence produced by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), nonrecombining Y-chromosome markers, and, most recently, study of autosomal microsatellite variation (Friedlaender et al. 2008). Geneticists have tended to test their patterns against simple models (Kayser 2010) of Pacific history that seek to map the “origins” of Polynesians and consider the amount of genetic admixture contributed by indigenous populations to Austronesian colonists. Often, this can lead to the definition of “Polynesian” genetic lineages in areas thousands of kilometers to the west of Polynesia (Mona et al. 2009). In Island Melanesia, this is ultimately tied to the debate over the origins of Lapita, as either an Austronesian intrusion or a local Bismarck innovation, and the importance of reticulate versus treelike models of culture history (Terrell 1988). For biologists, low amounts of genetic admixture correlate with limited local interaction and an “express-train” model, while a “slow-boat” model postulates colonists interacting with indigenous populations, producing high amounts of admixture as they slowly pass from points of origin to Polynesia (Diamond 1988; Diamond and Bellwood 2003; Hurles et al. 2003; Oppenheimer 2004). Recently, Hunley et al. (2007) have moved to explicit biological models that drop the culture history associated with the express-train and slow-boat models. They formulate “population-fission” and “isolation-by-distance” models. The former is a model “in which populations split as they expand to occupy new territories” (Hunley et al. 2007:141), then remain relatively isolated, and as a result create treelike or evolutionary patterns of relationship. The isolation-by-distance model has people exchanging genes and language with their neighbors as a function of intermarriage, which will produce correlations with distance (i.e., neighbors should be more alike) and reticulate relationships. These models are essentially models of interaction designed to look specifically at patterns of genetic variation in Northern Melanesia. The development of such focused models and studies is an improvement over one-size-fits-all approaches that incorporate Asian origins, Austronesian expansion, Lapita development, and the origins of Polynesians in one model when these may require a variety of explanations or models for different stages (Green 2003:103) or aspects of this complex process.</p>
            <p>A biological wave-of-advance model for Lapita expansion out of the Bismarcks into Remote Oceania would involve ongoing interaction along the expansion front with both the immediate population source and other populations, if present. This would predict considerable overall homogeneity throughout the region, with perhaps a cline of genetic similarity as foreign lineages (assuming intrusion of a Lapita “biology”) were swamped by indigenous lineages when the wave of advance moved through previously occupied areas in the Solomons. The resulting biology, at the time of colonization, should be very similar across the Lapita zone of Remote Oceania and like that of the eastern Solomons. A leapfrog model predicts close relationships between the biology of the Bismarcks and that of Remote Oceania, with little necessary similarity to that of the main Solomons. The leapfrog model also suggests repeated population movements from the Bismarcks to establish viable populations in the new region, providing the potential for repeated founder effects sampling any diversity found in the Bismarcks.</p>
            <p>The modern populations of the Bismarcks exhibit considerable genetic diversity. Studies of mtDNA indicate that although some of this is driven by topography and interior-versus-coastal divisions, which correlate to some degree with NAN-versus-Austronesian language distinctions, most variation is geographic, with neighboring coastal populations showing little language-based distinction (Friedlaender et al. 2007<italic>b</italic>). Therefore, islands and sectors of islands tend to have distinctive genetic patterns (Friedlaender et al. 2007<italic>b</italic>; Kayser et al. 2008<italic>a</italic>). Most of the mtDNA haplogroups currently identified in the region are ancient. Two, B4a1a1 and E, are considered by Friedlaender to date to the Holocene and are potentially associated with the development of the Lapita phenomenon. The relatively common B4a1a1 haplogroup, which includes the “Polynesian motif,” is very common in East Polynesia and is considered a marker of Polynesian heritage. In the Bismarcks, it has a variable distribution (Kayser 2010) and is often found in low frequencies, especially in eastern New Britain (fig. 8 in Friedlaender et al. 2007<italic>b</italic>).<sup>6</sup> Therefore, the development of Lapita throughout the Bismarcks does not correlate, on the basis of modern genetics, in any simple fashion with biology or an intrusive homogenizing population. As a source region for further expansion it is highly variable, potentially allowing identification of source populations under the leapfrog model.</p>
            <p>There are few genetic data sets or analyses that cover the Near-Remote Oceania transition in detail, and the Solomons and Vanuatu–New Caledonia are poorly studied. Friedlaender et al. (2007<italic>a</italic>, 2007<italic>b</italic>, 2008) have recently provided a mtDNA data set that covers our area of interest. Figure 6 shows a cluster analysis of data presented in table 4.2 in Friedlaender et al. (2007<italic>a</italic>), excluding the very rare F, Y, and M27 lineages, which are virtually absent (<inline-formula id="if1">
                  <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="if1.eps"/>
               </inline-formula>) from the data studied, which included all Bismarcks, Solomons, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Fiji data. In addition, an extra sample for Manus was added from Kayser et al. (2008<italic>a</italic>) to complement the very small sample in the original data set. The frequencies of the 23 lineages reported were converted to percentages and clustered (average linkage). The resulting plot presents a number of higher-order clusters, which show significant geographical patterning. The first grouping includes all samples from Mussau, New Ireland, western New Britain, Bougainville, the main Solomon Islands (Malaita) and Fiji. These are essentially populations with high frequencies of the “Polynesian motif,” B4a1a1. The second group includes all eastern New Britain populations and Remote Island Melanesia (Santa Cruz, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia), with the exception of Fiji. These are populations with low (&lt;36%) to no Polynesian motif, high frequencies of the ancient Melanesian lineages Q1 and Q2, and they are distinguished by high frequencies of M28a1 and M28a2. Within this group, Mamusi, Ata, Mali, and Kaket populations can be distinguished by an almost complete absence of the Polynesian motif and the presence of a variety of older “Melanesian” lineages. The final cluster is distinguished by very low to no “Polynesian” motif and very high frequencies of Q1. This would appear to reflect older populations either isolated in the interior of New Britain and Bougainville or within the remote Admiralties Group.<fig id="fg6" position="float" fig-type="figure">

            <p>These data show a clear, close relationship between Remote Oceania and the Bismarcks, in particular eastern New Britain, and a lack of the relationship with the main Solomons and Bougainville that would be expected from a wave-of-advance model. Surprisingly, the Reef/Santa Cruz group clusters most closely with the coastal language group located next to the Talasea Peninsula and the major Lapita obsidian sources. The exception to this pattern is Fiji, which has a very high (60%) percentage of the “Polynesian motif” (Friedlaender et al. 2007<italic>a</italic>), making it more like its Polynesian neighbors to the east and perhaps reflecting Polynesian interaction into Fiji.</p>
            <p>Recently, additional genetic data (Kayser 2010) have become available from the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome (NRY) for the Bismarck region, providing a picture of male lineages in the region (Scheinfeldt et al. 2006). These, like the mtDNA data, have shown considerable diversity within the region and an unexpectedly very low Asian signature. The geographic pattern of variation is, however, similar to that seen in the mtDNA, with a distinctive difference between New Britain and New Ireland–Bougainville (fig. 2 in Scheinfeldt et al. 2006). Unfortunately, comparable data are not available for the Solomons, Santa Cruz, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia, although the limited Vanuatu data are comparable to those from the Bismarcks. Most recently, Friedlaender et al. (2008) have reported the analysis of 687 microsatellite and 203 insertion/deletion polymorphisms in 952 individuals from 41 Pacific populations; unfortunately, as with the NRY data, crucial areas south of Bougainville in Island Melanesia are not represented. However, within the Bismarcks and Bougainville, the earlier patterns from mtDNA and NRY are maintained and refined, with new lower-level discrimination of the north, south, east, and west coasts of New Britain and of New Ireland from Bougainville (fig. 8 in Friedlaender et al. 2008). Application of these methods to the rest of Island Melanesia should be able to clearly identify source populations in the Bismarck Archipelago. If, as the leapfrog model suggests, Remote Oceania was settled by repeated direct colonization events from the Bismarcks, fine-grained genetic data from Remote Oceania should be able to test the details of this hypothesis. Although many more genetic data are required from the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia, authors of the most recent work on mtDNA from a small western Solomon Islands sample (Ricaut et al. 2010) support the leapfrog proposal.</p>

            <title>Archaeological Evidence</title>
            <p>It is rather difficult to predict what an archaeological record of early Lapita occupation of the main Solomon Islands would look like. Although there may be some Lapita preference for small islands, that may simply reflect relative ease of archaeological survey (Bedford and Spriggs 2008:112; Specht 2007). The Solomons have an abundance of rich lagoons and large islands fringed by barrier reef/island complexes, which are easily comparable to areas settled in the Bismarcks and Remote Oceania. There would appear, then, to be no environmental basis for avoiding the region, yet there is no evidence for early Lapita settlement south of Buka. For virtually all of the central and eastern Solomons, there is no record at all of any ceramics from any period. Only on the small island of Santa Ana, on the edge of Remote Oceania, has a handful of very poor quality plain ceramics been recovered, after extensive excavations by William Davenport (1972),<sup>7</sup> followed up by work by Roger Green and Pamela Swadling (Swadling 2000). My new fieldwork there in 2009 failed to find additional ceramic evidence.</p>
            <p>In the western Solomons and Bougainville, there is a relatively abundant ceramic record extending up to the historic period but not extending back beyond the late Lapita period. The standard explanation for this apparent gap is limited archaeological reconnaissance; however, as Sheppard and Walter (2006) have argued, there has been considerable Solomons research over the past 40 years that is certainly comparable to the amount of research conducted before the first finding of early Lapita sites in the rest of the Lapita range. Perhaps most telling is the work of the Southeast Solomons Culture History project, which found numerous Lapita sites in the Reef/Santa Cruz Group and Tikopia in Remote Oceania but, employing the same approach, found none in Ulawa, Ughi, Santa Ana, and Makira in the Eastern Solomons. Similarly, the excavation of large volumes of cultural deposit, including deposits of Lapita age, from Vatuluma Posovi (Poha) Cave at the back of a coastal flat on Guadalcanal revealed no ceramics from any period. This, plus extensive fieldwork on western Guadalcanal, led Roe (1993) to conclude that the island had been bypassed by Lapita settlement.</p>
            <p>Beginning in 1996, I initiated a program of research in the Western Solomons, one goal of which was to search for the presumed missing Lapita link between the Bismarcks and the Southeast Solomons. I conducted, along with my colleague Richard Walter (University of Otago) and numerous PhD and MA students, an initial archaeological survey over a period of years (1996–2001) in the Roviana Lagoon region of New Georgia, followed by another program of research 70 km to the west on the island of Vella Lavella (2001–2007). During this time, we recorded 24 late Lapita or Lapita-derived intertidal sites, and research by others added four sites to the total of 28 presented in figure 7. This research indicates that such sites are ubiquitous in the Western Solomons, extending eastward a tradition of Lapita intertidal “stilt-village” occupation commonly found in the Bismarck Archipelago (Gosden and Webb 1994; Kirch 1987). Although the ceramic tradition (incised and appliqué designs) represented in these sites is clearly late Lapita or Lapita derived, only a very small sample of dentate stamped sherds have been recovered, with the Honiavasa site in Roviana Lagoon having the most (six) and only a few sites having some of the complex carinated pot forms (Honiavasa, Zoraka/Nusa Roviana, and Poitete; Felgate 2001, 2003 [figs. 7, 9]; Summerhayes and Scales 2005) of classic Lapita. Direct dating of carbon inclusions on or in sherds provides late Lapita ages for some of these sites (charcoal inclusion in a sherd from Paniavile [AA33504; <inline-formula id="if2">

            <p>Given the abundance of late Lapita evidence in the Western Solomons recovered over the past 20 years by a variety of researchers and research programs, the question remains of how well the known record reflects the actual occupation history. Perhaps earlier sites are yet to be found or the early record has been destroyed. Proving the absence of evidence is rather difficult; however, assessing specific hypotheses of systematic destruction of the record is feasible. Felgate (2003, 2007) has proposed that geotectonic processes have significantly altered the record of intertidal sites in the Western Solomons. Using the work of Mann et al. (1998), Felgate has argued that significant rates of uplift in areas such as Roviana Lagoon have moved earlier intertidal sites up into the swash zone and ultimately into dry areas, where the salt-impregnated sherds would rapidly deteriorate, based on our observations of the fate of untreated sherds removed from intertidal sites. Felgate’s hypothesis depends on the accuracy of the Mann et al. (1998) proposed model of regional uplift and the careful assessment of the geotectonic setting of the individual intertidal sites. The strong earthquake and associated tsunami of Easter 2007 has renewed interest in the geotectonics of the Western Solomons, and in December 2007 I returned to Roviana to assess the setting of the intertidal sites and the potential effect of such events (Sheppard and Walter 2009).</p>
            <p>Figure 7 summarizes the Mann et al. (1998) model of geotectonic movement in the Western Solomons and the distribution of reported intertidal sites. This figure illustrates that there is considerable variability in the rates of geotectonic movement in the region and that late Lapita or Lapita-derived sites are found throughout the area, including in places where no uplift has been measured (e.g., north Kolombangara and north Vella Lavella). Therefore, we cannot propose a uniform geotectonic process to explain the known distribution of sites throughout the Western Solomons. Roviana Lagoon, however, is one region where such an explanation is feasible, because Mann et al. (1998) propose an annual rate of uplift of 0.6–0.9 mm for the lagoon.</p>
            <p>Detailed consideration of geotectonics and the archaeological record in Roviana are presented in Sheppard and Walter (2009), where each site context is reviewed. That study involved recording height profiles across the intertidal sites and the adjacent shoreline and also recording raised beach terraces and old wave notches. The results are summarized as follows.</p>
            <p>1. There is evidence of a raised terrace, which can be found at circa 2–3 m above mean low tide around the lagoon and is consistent with estimates of the mid-Holocene high stand elsewhere in the western Pacific (Dickinson 2001; Mitrovica and Peltier 1991).</p>
            <p>2. Intertidal ceramic sites are found at the mouths of rivers and adjacent to springs on the current shore of the lagoon mainland, indicating that the wide, low, swampy shore through which streams meander dates at least to 2000 BP and is probably the result of progradation that started when the lagoon was established after the mid-Holocene high stand.</p>
            <p>3. Dated intertidal sites (e.g., Hoghoi) on the inner shore of the barrier islands should be raised up to 2 m, given a constant uplift rate of 0.7 mm per year. This would require an original depth of more than 3 m, without considering potentially higher water levels associated with the run down from the mid-Holocene high stand. Construction of stilt houses in an original depth of water of 3+ m seems improbable.</p>
            <p>The Mann et al. (1998) model for uplift in Roviana assumed constant uplift in the absence of other data. Whether geotectonic events in the region are a function of slow and constant or episodic interactions between the Pacific and Australian plates has been debated (Taylor et al. 2005). Study of the archaeological site distribution on the mainland coast of Roviana indicates limited uplift over at least the past 2,000 years. Most recently, the earthquake of 2007 has resulted in dramatic, instantaneous uplift in parts of the New Georgia Group; on Rannonga this was more than 2 m, while in Roviana it has resulted in sudden subsidence of up to 65 cm at the western end of the lagoon and of 39 cm in the central section of Roviana (Taylor et al. 2008). This indicates that Roviana is subject to episodic subsidence after major tectonic activity, potentially followed by slow rates of uplift. The archaeological evidence suggests that the sum effect for at least the past 2,000 years has been minimal. It is possible that a sudden uplift before circa 2600 BP destroyed an earlier Lapita record, but at present there is no evidence of such an event. What is clear is the fact that the Roviana geotectonic record is complex through both time and space and cannot be modeled with a simple constant rate of uplift. As a consequence, no uniform model can be employed to explain the distribution of intertidal sites in the region and the lack of an early Lapita record.</p>

            <title>Summary of the Linguistic, Biological, and Archaeological Data</title>
            <p>A simple wave-of-advance model predicts smooth clines of spatial variability with neighbors looking most like one another, while leapfrog models predict disjuncture and founder effects that potentially create considerable spatial heterogeneity. The linguistic evidence demonstrates that the languages spoken by the descendants of the Lapita settlers who first crossed into Remote Oceania and settled in the region of the Reef/Santa Cruz Group and neighboring islands (Reef/Santa Cruz–Utupua-Vanikoro) are most closely related to languages in the eastern Bismarck Archipelago, possibly to languages in the vicinity of Mussau. They are not closely related to those of their nearest neighbors to the west in the main Solomon Islands.</p>
            <p>The genetic data create a highly variable spatial picture throughout Island Melanesia, and even within the Bismarck Archipelago there is no simple “Lapita” genetic signature or association between genetics and the distribution of Lapita pottery. Examination of mitochondrial DNA shows samples from Santa Cruz and Vanuatu to be most similar to samples from New Britain east of the Willaumez Peninsula, not to samples from elsewhere in the Bismarcks or the Northern Solomons. This eastern New Britain–Santa Cruz–Vanuatu grouping is characterized by very low levels of the “Polynesian motif” and high frequencies of ancient Melanesian lineages. The Santa Cruz sample is most like the sample from the Nakanai language group, which is currently located just to the east of the Talasea Peninsula, where most of the obsidian in the Reef/Santa Cruz sites was obtained. Although much more genetic study is required southeast of the Bismarcks, available data show considerable disjuncture in genetic spatial distributions, supportive of a leapfrog model. Recent genetic research in the Western Solomons has concluded by supporting that model (Ricaut et al. 2010).</p>
            <p>On the basis of archaeological research to date, there is a clear gap in the distribution of Lapita sites, with only late Lapita ceramics found in the Western Solomons and no Lapita in the main Solomons east of New Georgia. But is this gap real, or does it simply reflect inadequate research and/or systematic destruction and poor archaeological visibility? It is perhaps significant to note that in every location in Island Melanesia where there is a Lapita record, there is also a visible post-Lapita ceramic record, although in some instances ceramics production eventually ceases. Even in the Western Solomons, limited amounts of plainware are present in the late prehistoric record, and these have been regularly reported by all archaeologists working in the region. In contrast, the only ceramics ever reported from the central and eastern Solomon Islands are the handful of early plainware sherds from Santa Ana; beyond that there is no ceramic tradition, suggesting the lack of a Lapita foundation. Whether the record is obscured or destroyed is hard to determine. Variation in geomorphological processes and rates of sedimentation and weathering exist across the Lapita range. Deep volcanic ash on northern Vanuatu has both buried and preserved Lapita deposits, creating in most areas a landscape devoid of Lapita-age surface deposits, while tectonic uplift has altered the location of shorelines (Bedford 2007). A thin layer of ash may have helped preserve numerous Lapita deposits in the Reef/Santa Cruz Group (Green, Jones, and Sheppard 2008); however, they are being gardened onto the surface today. In the main Solomons south of Bougainville, there are no volcanic ash deposits, and Lapita sites should often be close to the surface. In the Western Solomons, tectonic movement may have destroyed part of the record of the ubiquitous intertidal sites, but as we have discussed, this process is not uniform and cannot be invoked to explain the destruction of an early Lapita record throughout the studied region. Elsewhere to the north, on Buka and in the Bismarck Archipelago, early Lapita intertidal sites are relatively common (Kirch 1997), and given the large number of intertidal sites reported in the Western Solomons, it seems highly unlikely they would have been missed. Taken together, the present linguistic, biological, and archaeological data are very consistent with one another and present a disjunct spatial pattern indicative of a leapfrog model. This strongly supports the leapfrog model of settlement of Remote Oceania directly from the Bismarck Archipelago by people making Lapita pottery and the avoidance of the main Solomon Islands until the late Lapita period.</p>

         <title>Discussion: Why a Leapfrog? Push and Pull Factors</title>
         <p>The rapid movement of Lapita out into Remote Oceania suggests the presence of a trigger event or a sudden change of conditions. Two such push factors have been proposed: major volcanic activity on New Britain and the development of favorable eastward sailing conditions during a period of ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) activity.</p>
         <p>The massive WK-2 (Machida et al. 1996) plinian eruption of the Witori volcano covered much of West New Britain east of the Willaumez Peninsula with thick layers of volcanic ash, with the 20-cm isopach covering the breadth of the island for a distance of more than 100 km and creating much of the modern landscape. Earlier dating of this event placed it in the 3830–3350-BP range (SUA-2814; <inline-formula id="if4">
               <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="if4.eps"/>
            </inline-formula>; Machida et al. 1996), which locates it outside most of the Lapita time frame. New dating and Bayesian analysis of the event place it well within the Lapita period (3480–3150 BP, modal age 3315 BP; table 5 of Petrie and Torrence 2008) and potentially just before the Lapita expansion into Remote Oceania. Petrie and Torrence (2008:740) have drawn attention to the association of this event with the appearance of Lapita and have suggested that the widespread extinction or disruption of cultural groups in West New Britain may have facilitated the introduction of new immigrants or the local adoption of pottery. Although no Lapita pottery has been found under the WK-2 ash, there is no doubt that local non-pottery-producing residents were displaced, altering regional population dynamics and creating an unpopulated zone that was eventually reoccupied, after a few hundred years, by people making Lapita pottery (Torrence, Neall, and Boyd 2009<italic>a</italic>). It should, however, also be noted that obsidian from the Talasea region, within the affected area, is found at all the earliest Lapita sites, indicating continuity of contact with the Willaumez region throughout the Lapita period. Whatever the exact effect, it is reasonable to propose that the eruption was a dramatic event visible throughout the Bismarcks, resulting in major population disruption that had knock-on effects throughout the New Britain/New Ireland region.</p>
         <p>Irwin (1992, 2008) has demonstrated the feasibility and utility of purposeful sailing upwind against the prevailing southeasterly trade winds in the settlement of Near and Remote Oceania, taking advantage of periodic westerlies for outward downwind legs. Although travel within the Bismarck and Solomon archipelagos would have provided comparatively easy coastal voyaging, in a region where historic movement of war canoes often involved paddle voyages of more than 200 km (Bathgate 1985), movement out into Remote Oceania would have been greatly facilitated by westerly winds. Recently, Anderson et al. (2006) have noted that the ENSO record applicable to the western Pacific indicates a sudden increase in El Niño events starting at 3200 BP and continuing until 2200 BP. Such events reduced the strength of the southeasterly trade winds and facilitated downwind sailing to the east. Although, as Irwin (2008) argues, the Anderson et al. (2006) model minimizes the role of sailing innovation, the theories are mutually reinforcing, and together they suggest that the period starting at 3200 BP was an optimum time for colonizing Remote Oceania, when both innovation in sailing capability and favorable weather conditions potentially converged for the first time.</p>
         <p>Once the Lapita colonizers of Remote Oceania moved across the 350-km water gap from the main Solomon Islands, they would have encountered something neither they nor their ancestors had seen before: islands without people and without any of the commensal or symbiotic plants, animals, insects, or microbes that had shaped their lives for generations. Although movement out into the Pacific was movement into a terrestrially depauperate environment, where no land mammals other than bats could be found, this was more than made up for by the untouched marine, bird, and reptilian fauna, including now extinct megapodes, crocodiles, and tortoise. In the first generations, the return from exploitation of these resources would have been outstanding, and it is perhaps significant that none of the earlier translocations of indigenous New Guinea animals into the Bismarcks, with the exception of the large spiny rat (<italic>Rattus praetor</italic>), which was transported to the Reef/Santa Cruz Group, Tikopia, Vanuatu, and Fiji (White, Clark, and Bedford 2000), occurred into Remote Oceania. Ultimately, chickens, pigs, dogs, and the Polynesian rat made it out into Remote Oceania, but is notable that the distribution of these animals is patchy and not at all strongly associated with colonization (Anderson 2003; Matisoo-Smith 2007). It has been argued that initial Lapita colonizers were “strandloopers” (Anderson 2003; Davidson and Leach 2001; Groube 1971) living off of the abundant resources of untouched islands. It is clear that Lapita peoples had knowledge of and used domesticates (Green 1979<italic>b</italic>), including plants (Horrocks and Bedford 2005; Horrocks, Bedford, and Spriggs 2009; Horrocks and Nunn 2007), which they transported into Remote Oceania. It is also clear that early Lapita settlements show very heavy exploitation of rich marine and bird resources, such as the very abundant turtle remains found in early Tongan and Tikopian sites or the large megapodes of New Caledonia, which became extinct shortly after Lapita settlement (Burley 1999; Kirch 1997:199–226). Perhaps the most striking evidence of the early importance of mixed terrestrial and marine animal protein in the diet in Remote Oceania is the isotopic data on teeth and bone from the early Lapita Teouma cemetery in Vanuatu (Bentley et al. 2007; Valentin et al. 2010). This shows that the majority of the population appears to have spent their childhood locally and had a significant marine signature, while four individuals interpreted to have been immigrants had a significantly reduced marine signature. At least one of these individuals is interpreted as a man of some importance, and the inference is that these immigrants were from the original colonizing movement out of Near Oceania. Isotopic evidence from late Lapita–age burials in New Britain indicates a diet dominated by terrestrial protein and plants (Beavan Athfield et al. 2008). The authors of the most recent isotopic study at Teouma conclude by favoring “the hypothesis of a mixed economy including maritime exploitation, terrestrial foraging and low-level food production” (Valentin et al. 2010:1827).</p>
         <p>Although the abundant untouched resources of the new islands would have been immediately apparent, it would have been only a short time before another powerful advantage became apparent: there was no malaria (Buckley 2005; Kirch 1997:110). The current mortality rate among children and pregnant women is very high in Near Oceania, and at any one time a very significant percentage of the population suffers malaria attacks. The modern incidence of malaria in the Solomon Islands is among the highest in the world (152 per 1000 in 2005), and the associated mortality (7.54 per 100,000 in 2005) is exceeded, within the Pacific, only by Papua New Guinea. Although the incidence of malaria in Vanuatu was relatively high in 2005 (44 per 1000), there was zero mortality (table 7 in Breman and Holloway 2007). Today, the Buxton line marks the limits of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes and malaria, which extend only as far south as Vanuatu, with the north being more malarious than the south. The rest of Remote Oceania is malaria free. When people first crossed into Remote Oceania in the Reef/Santa Cruz Group, there would have been no malaria, given the absence of the human host. It also appears likely that there was no vector for transmission, because in Remote Oceania there is only one species (<italic>Anopheles farauti</italic> s.s.) of the common mosquito vector (the <italic>Anopheles punctulatus</italic> group), while in the Solomons there are 12 (Beebe et al. 2000; Lum et al. 2007). Although there is evidence that <italic>A. farauti</italic> can feed on nonhuman hosts, Lum et al. (2007) argue that this pattern of species diversity, which correlates with the timing and length of human colonization of the Pacific, and the fact that <italic>A. farauti</italic> is salt tolerant, indicate that the Vanuatu mosquito came ultimately at some unknown point after human colonization as a hitchhiker on boats (Lum et al. 2007). When this occurred is as yet unknown, although Buckley (2005) attributes comparatively high levels of anemia, as evidenced by skeletal remains from Taumako just east of the Reef/Santa Cruz Group and dating after 470 BP (Leach and Davidson 2008), to malaria.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The prehistory of the settlement of Near and Remote Oceania involves debate over a series of puzzles. When was Near Oceania settled? What is the “origin” of the Lapita cultural complex? Why did that elaborate cultural complex suddenly move out into Remote Oceania and almost as quickly disappear? How do we account for the linguistic, cultural, and biological diversity of Remote Oceania, especially the Melanesia/Polynesia division, when it appears to have a common Lapita ancestor?</p>
         <p>The wave-of-advance model makes most of this problematic, because it promotes the idea of homogeneity and, at most, clines of variation. Explaining the observed diversity and disjuncture in linguistic, biological, and archaeological patterns under such a scenario calls for subsequent diversity in localized but powerful historical forces capable of radically altering and, in some cases, obliterating earlier patterns. Therefore, explanation of the Tryon-Hackman line in the Solomons requires a second wave of Austronesian speakers into the Western Solomons; explanation of the conservative nature of the Southeast Solomonic languages requires significant interaction with NAN speakers in the Western Solomons but not in the central Solomons; explanation of linguistic diversity in the Island Melanesia sector of Remote Oceania calls for a second wave of “NAN”-speaking peoples into that region after the Lapita settlement, of such magnitude as to significantly alter cultural and linguistic patterns before being subsumed into the earlier Austronesian cultural pattern; and finally, the explanation of biological differences between populations called Melanesian and Polynesian in the Western Pacific requires genetic bottlenecks in the Lapita period, at a time of unsurpassed regional interaction, and/or subsequent migration of biologically Melanesian populations into Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Fiji. The leapfrog model of Lapita settlement into Remote Oceania greatly simplifies many of these scenarios by allowing for rapid expansion and radical spatial disjuncture in linguistic, cultural, and biological patterns and by generating the potential for significant founder effects.</p>
         <p>Linguistic, biological, and archaeological evidence all support the leapfrog hypothesis. Why the leapfrog occurred is perhaps unknowable, but serendipity and historical accident, rather than some systematic process, must underlie this event. Specific historical factors, such as a massively destructive eruption on New Britain at the start of the Lapita period (Petrie and Torrence 2008) and the increase in El Niño events facilitating sailing to the east (Anderson et al. 2006) by people with suitable boats, must have played a role. Once found, pull factors must have included the lure of untouched marine and sea bird resources (Kirch 1997:199–226), which isotopic analysis shows formed a significant part of the diet in Remote Oceania. Most significantly, the absence of malaria (Kirch 1997:110), which has an extremely high incidence in the Solomons, seems very likely to have been another pull factor.</p>
         <p>The implications for archaeological, biological, and linguistic models relate predominately to the importance of founder effects in understanding Pacific prehistory. A leapfrog will create unexpected geographic breaks in data and conceivably result in repeated sampling of the homeland variation. Biological and linguistic similarities are to be expected between the Bismarcks and remote Island Melanesia and reflect variation in the Bismarcks. More biological research is required in the Solomons, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Fiji, and the first focus must be on the origins of these Lapita descendants. For these are the direct descendants of Lapita settlers of Remote Oceania, and there is little need to invoke some subsequent process of “Melanization.” Once Lapita had reached Remote Oceania, much of the subsequent Lapita colonization may represent direct movements, or leapfrogs, as opposed to a wave of advance. The recent report of Lapita pottery with distinctive temper from Island Melanesia in the oldest Tongan Lapita site is argued by the excavators to be the result of direct settlement from that region (Burley and Dickinson 2001, 2010). Ultimately, Polynesian origins are related to Lapita settlement but form a separate and potentially more complicated issue, as suggested by the Polynesian/Micronesian linkages in Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill’s (2009, their fig. 1) phylogenetic study of Austronesian languages and as recently discussed by Addison and Matisoo-Smith (2010).</p>
