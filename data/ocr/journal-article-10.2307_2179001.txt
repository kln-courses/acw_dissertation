<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studies in Human Nature. By J. B. BAILLIE. London, G. Bell and Sons, I92I.-Pp. Xii, 296. This book by the Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the Uni- versity of Aberdeen is made up of an Introduction and nine 'Studies' or essays with the following titles: (i) Anthropomorphism and Truth; (II) The Realistic Character of Knowledge; (III) Certain Non-Logical Factors in the Process of Knowledge; (IV) The Nature of Memory-Knowledge; (V) The Function of Emotion in the Con- sciotisness of the Real; (VI) The Significance of Philosophical Scepticism; (VII) The Place of Philosophy in Human Nature; (VIII) Science and the Humanities; (IX) Laughter and Tears: The Sense of Incongruity. The philosophical standpoint from which the book is written is indicated in a general way by the title of the book and by certain statements in the preface. "It is not the purpose of these papers," the author writes, "to defend or support any of the familiarly ac- cepted theories, whether of idealism or realism.

We best avoid the defects of one-sided theories if we follow the path of what Sidg- wick used to call critical common sense, and hold to the natural solidarity of human experience to which it clings. .. The best service which philosophy can render at the present time is that of supplying a criticism of life." The different essays are all concerned with human nature in its theoretical aspects, but the author suggests a purpose to treat on another occasion of the problems of morality and civic institutions which the upheaval of the present time has forced into prominence. Professor Baillie's discussions are characterized by great clearness and independence of thought. His book is no hasty production, but is marked by literary finish and gives evidence of wide reading and careful thinking. One may disagree in the end with many of the author's conclusions, but will scarcely fail to be stimulated and in- structed by his acute analyses and his frank criticisms of philosophi- cal systems. It is against idealism, especially as held by Mr. Bradley and Dr. Bosanquet, that he most often directs his attack; but he also sometimes finds occasion to point out the errors of pragmatism' and modern realism in convincing terms. It would not be altogether fair to the more constructive sides of Professor Baillie's work to say that the book is the expression of disillusionment with historical systems of philosophy. Neverthe- less it is hard altogether to avoid this suggestion. Both in the Introduction and in the essay entitled "The Place of Philosophy in Human Nature," the defects and limitations of philosophy are em- phasized. "This review of the want of unanimity between philoso- phers and the failure of philosophy to reach centainty on the main issues discussed, must give any candid mind ground for reflection concerning the claims of the philosopher to supply the final or the whole meaning of reality" (p. 8i). "The philosophical moodhas no better justification than any special instinct, or than any rare intuition. ... When philosophers try to prove the problem of phi- losophy to be necessary in the sense that the very nature of humanity involves it, they are merely accentuating the importance of philosophy to themselves by saying that this is the special way a human mind works in their particular case" (p. i98). It is fortunate that critics are never lacking to laugh at the philos- opher's pride and to force him to moderate his pretensions. But</page><page sequence="3">626 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXX. after all there is another side to the matter. May not a sense of disillusionment with systematic philosophy be the result of having cherished excessive or wrong expectations? One cannot legitimately demand the same type of demonstration in philosophy that one finds, for example, in mathematics or in biology. Is it not true that those who emphasize the failures of philosophers and the unconvincing character of philosophical arguments usually have in mind the de- mands of the logic of the special sciences? Taking this type of comprehensibility as their standard, they inevitably find that philosophy falls short. I believe that this explains to some extent at least Professor Baillie's judgments of the achievements of both historical and contemporary philosophy. And, closely connected with this point, his conception of philosophy as a construction of the abstract intellect leads him to describe it as an interest and activity that has no spe- cial prerogative but is coordinate with the activity of "any other special instinct." Since reason is a specialized function that com- paratively few possess, philosophy must give itself no airs. As we shall see later, the doctrine of intellect or reason as "a specific ac- tivity of mind coordinate with others " is one of the central doc- trines of the whole volume. Another main point of emphasis that runs throughout the book is the conception of the individuality of the mind as "a global en- tirety." "Differentiation of its functions arises through its action and reaction on the world, but the integrity of the whole remains a reality, the primary reality, from first to last... In actual fact we never lose sight of or ignore this solid integrity of the mind's life " (p. i8). I am not sure that I understand how this unity in specialization is conceived by the author, although I have tried to tollate his statements on this point. The difficulty is in reconciling statements such as I have quoted with the frequently recurring in- sistence on the independence of logic exhibited by various non-logical aspects of the mind. "They require no assistance from intellectual procedure as such, and are not affected or governed by its peculiar laws" (p. I7). The clearest explanation of Professor Baillie's po- sition is given on pages 34 ff., where referring to his own former difficulties, he says: "It seemed impossible to understand how the intellect could at once be taken as the only avenue to the intelligible, i.e., mentally satisfying, apprehension of the real, and yet to hold that it was compelled to leave over a residium of the real as beyond its grasp. . . . When, however, one observes that the intellect is</page><page sequence="4">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 627 from the first and in principle a mental operation consciously distinguished from, and even set apart by the mind itself in contrast to the other functions of the mind's life (more particularly the functions of feeling and striving), the difficulty in question disappears. For then it follows that it cannot expect to get the whole of the real world into its net, since it starts by being only a partial expression of the mind's life. The mind has other functions and other ways of approaching the real world, and no intellectual activity can be a substitute for these." But these different functions "are connected in their source and connected in their final purpose. They em- anate from the one integral life of mind seeking at all costs and by all its operations to meet the call of the real world " (p. 37). "Each of these operations abstracts in order to achieve; but all are special expressions of the fundamental nature of the mental life, of which each is a particular form" (pp. i6-I7). Emotion and volition are necessary to balance the achievements of thought. "When the mind is in possession of the resources and accomplishments of all of them, it reaches the highest level of its life. This consists in the restoration or reinstatement, at a higher level, of the primordial integrity of mind from which its being as an individual whole starts, and for the maintenance of which the enterprise and adventure of its experience are undertaken" (p. 38). The different functions of experience have, then, an underlying identity which form the integral mind, and represent "the highest level of its life." But Professor Baillie's restriction of logic to as single abstract phase of mind makes it difficult to understand his conception of 'unity in difference.' It is admitted that at the highest~ level of the mind's life a fuller 'intelligibility' and 'satisfaction' are attained than is possible through the operations of the abstract intelligence. The question arises, then, has this 'intelligibility' no assignable order or form? Or, from the point of view of the mind, in what terms would the author have us conceive the 'globular unity" to which he refers? He rejects summarily as a confusion the con- crete logic of Hegel and Dr. Bosanquet, while agreeing with them as to the limitations of what they call the logic of the understanding, But if the unity is to contribute to a higher 'intelligibility' it must transform the differences so as to make transparent their comple- tary relationships; it cannot be simply a common door through which they are all received. And in order that the result may not remain opaque, but become really 'intelligible,' the movement of mind that.</page><page sequence="5">628 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXX. restores the primordial unity and lifts it to a higher plane must proceed in accordance with principles that are capable of statement in universal terms. Notwithstanding his distrust of logic, or perhaps rather because of it, Professor Baillie does not, then, seem to have succeeded in avoiding logical difficulties. When he comes to discuss the nature of knowledge, his analyses serve to emphasize the fact that knowledge is a possession of the individual mind, not something that is deper- sonalized and undergoes development on its own account; and also that it is not a mere play of subjective ideas but has a necessary relation to other minds and to a physical order. But again his dis- trust of logical theory prevents him from making clear how these apparently conflicting contentions are to be reconciled. Here, and in other discussions as well, one feels that while his results are true in substance and need to be borne in mind, they nevertheless lose some- thing of their point and value from the failure to bring them into an organized system of relationship. In this respect one may com- pare Professor Baillie's attitude with that of his predecessor, Thomas Reid, whose 'philosophy of common sense' gave lustre to the chair of philosophy at Aberdeen in the eighteenth century. The papers on " Non-Logical Factors in the Process of Knowl- edge," " Memory-Knowledge," and "The Function of Emotion in the Conscious of the Real,"' are careful and solid pieces of work, full of instruction and the interest of concrete illustration. The last mentioned seems to me a most valuable discussion of its subject in :spite of my failure to follow the author's method of coordinating emotion and knowledge. The principle of the final essay on "Laughter and Tears" traverses ground that is comparatively un- familiar, and makes, I think, a distinct contribution to the under- standing of the subject. Laughter arises from a realization of the incongruence between the end and the process or means through which it is realized. In order that an object shall be a proper subject of laughter, its end must be maintained in spite of the incon- gruity and the object itself must not suffer permanent loss (p. 259). On the other hand, tears arise when the end is hoplessly defeated, but is allowed still to control the desire to possess it (p. 273). These general theses the author develops concretely with abundant illustra- tion drawn from life and from literature. It is interesting to note the sharp distinction which he draws between intellectual apprehension and appreciation. As against Bergson's remark that "Comedy is</page><page sequence="6">No. 6.], REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 629 addressed to the pure intelligence," the writer maintains that laughter is not due merely to understanding. "The apprehension of a situa- tion is presupposed in laughter; but in order that laughter may arise, the situation must also be appreciated, i.e., must be judged in the light of an end to which the process or material, involved in the situation, stands in a certain relation of incongruity. The incongru- ity is an actual fact, so is the end, and therefore the appreciation is bieu fondue, and is perfectly correct" (p. 290). It is impossible to reproduce here in summary the conclusions of the author's various ' Studies.' The book raises a great number of fundamental issues in a fresh and original form, and will well repay careful reading. But the reader is likely, I think, to be frequently perplexed when he attempts to combine into some kind of coherent view the various statements of doctrine. This, however, may only add to the book's interest. The difficulty of which I am speaking is not due merely to the unsystematic form of the volume, in being made up of separate essays, though this has doubtless enhanced it. But it seems to have its source in the author's distrust of systematic philosophy, which has led him to fall back upon the convictions and prejudices of common sense when philosophical analyses and con- structions are necessary. If one seeks further in order to discover the grounds of this estimate, one. finds the explanation to lie in Professor Baillie's conception of logic, and the nature of the system it constructs. For him the logic of philosophy appears to be a fixed set of general rules rather than a system of universal principles. His protest is thus in itself quite intelligible and even legitimate-a protest really directed against the tyranny of rules, against claims of finality and complete systematic character on the part of any philosophic theory that would exclude the full reality of individual assertion and creative action. If one has so conceived the systematic character of philosophy, such a protest has its value and justification. But is it not possible that the difficulty has arisen from mistakenly regarding the logic of philosophy in terms of rules rather than of principles? There can be no tyranny in a principle so long as it is not converted into a rule; it carries with it no claim to finality, but from its very nature leads on to further development. If we have not so learned the great systems of philosophy, we have in great measure learned them in vain. J. E. CREIGHTON. CORNELL UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
