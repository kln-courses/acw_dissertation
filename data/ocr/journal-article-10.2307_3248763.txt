<plain_text><page sequence="1">STELLA KRAMRISCH AN IMAGE OF ADITI-UTTANAPAD An image of great significance is preserved in the Museum at Alampur in the Southern Deccan (Fig. I-2).I The image is carved in a dark stone. The surface of the recumbent figure was worked to a high degree of polish. The mighty female shape lies facing upward on a nearly square plane. The rim of this surface frames the figure and allows the water that was poured over the image during worship to flow off through the spout at the proper left of the figure. The whole carved image with its squarish support (36" x 40") fulfilled the function of an altar (pitha).z It is replete with the high relief representing a majestic maternal body. It lies in the birth position. The broadly spread-out legs are drawn up laterally and bent at the knees. The soles of the feet are turned upward. Their modelling and the contraction of the toes show the tension and struggle which attend the process of giving birth. The feet accentuate the corners of the squarish altar and the width of the figure which is splayed out up to the knees. The elbows rest on them. The arms are bent upwards and the hands, each holding a lotus bud, are laid on the shoulders while the forefingers, in a sensitive and relaxed movement, touch upon the petals of the large and open lotus blossom that crowns the image, as its neck and head. A small and delicate bead necklace links chest and flower by the curve of its outline. It reposes on the surging modelling of the body which gains powerful volume in the large, flattened globes of the breasts with their lotus- nipples.3 Serpent armlets are coiled around the pillar shapes of the upper arms. Widely spaced bra- celets join their broadening accents to the monumental form of the upper half of the image, whereas thin anklets, quickened with serpentine energy, cling to the feet. But for these serpent ornaments, the figure is naked. The lower half of her body is modelled in the throes of muscular convulsion, from the palpitating flesh of hips and abdomen to their bud-like opening in the middle. The upper half of the body, however, lies calm in monumental gravity and fulfilment, sealed by the lotus flower on top, whose limp petals, pointing upward, pointing downward, recline in low relief against the swelling buds upheld by the serpentlike fingers of the image. None of the innumerable known shapes in which the goddess revealed herself to the Indian sculptors surpasses the power and consistency of the image in Alampur. It would seem to have i. e. in the former State of Hyderabad. The image is labelled as Nagna Kabandha, or "naked, headless body", which shows complete ignorance of the meaning of the sculpture. 2 The stone slab is at present installed on a cement base. The rim is damaged on the right proper of the image. There was, it seems, another outlet for the water. 3 Actual decoration of the breasts with flower or leaf pattern (patralekha; see Amarakosa) was used as an erotic and sym- bolical device (cf. Kadambari, ed. Kale, Bombay, I928, p. 98). 259</page><page sequence="2">belonged originally to one of the sanctuaries of this town of temples. The style of the modelling would assign the image to approximately the eighth century, although none of the images on the several temples, or in the Museum, of Alampur are equal in quality.4 None of them, mo- reover, portray a conception equal to that of the recumbent image. Nearer to it as a bodily type, though more schematically composed, would be certain images from Elura, such as the Durga in the Ramesvara Cave or the Indrani in the Indra Sabha.s The iconography of the image, though it has no known parallel, is nonetheless adumbrated, in one or several of its aspects, by more than one earlier work of art. Nearest in space and time is a fragment of an image in Mahakut, in the Southwestern Deccan (Fig. 3). The temples there date from the later part of the sixth century or about the year 600o.6 This would also be the date of the fragment of the image of the goddess with arms raised from the elbows, each hand facing outward and holding in kataka hasta the curved stalk of a lotus flower, just fully opening. They flank the main large flower whose outer circle of petals rests on the chest of the image and whose filaments form the centre high up- level with the top of the stele- of the large flower which exceeds in width the shoulders of the slim, long-armed goddess and is her crowning glory. Like her mightier sister image, this figure, too-wearing a double pair of wristlets-although it seems to have been shown sitting or standing upright, is carved in front of a plain back slab. It was partly cut out so as to throw into higher relief and outline more sharply the contour of the image. With the exception of two terra cotta plaques from northern India,7 of Kushan or early Gupta date, no other representations of the goddess are known whose body carries a lotus in place of neck and head. There are cognate conceptions, however, in the more remote past of Indian Art, the one from Sanchi of the second century B. C., the other from the Indus Valley of the 3rd Millennium B. C. One of the roundels carved in low relief on the railing posts of Stiipa II in Sanchi shows a typical configuration (Fig. 4). In free but calculated symmetry, two winged lions prance forth from pod-shaped bases carried on stalks which issue from a central device resembling an in- verted flower shape. Indented leaf and bud motifs spring from the same centre and fill the lower, lateral segments of the roundel. Above the lions two folded lotus leaves touch, with their chalice-like design, the apex of the circle. They are sent up on long stalks which likewise stem from the inverted floral fantasy at the bottom. Between their amphora-like lines, and at their widest divergence, a fully opened lotus flower tosses its petals and filaments around and below the emergent seed pod with its unusually broad top. The support of this central lotus bloom can hardly be described as a stalk. At either side of a thin, central ridge its shape, too broad for any stalk, is curved with the symmetry suggesting somehow lithe female limbs - topped by the lotus bloom. Above it, completing the vertical axis of the composition, garlands are suspended from one central point. 4 See Plates 73-75, 77; Stella Kramrisch, The Art of India. s See Plates 234 and 243; H. Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia. 6 See Plate 37, Kramrisch, op. cit., and Plates 24-26, The Golden Age of Indian Art by Rambach and de Golish. The image was lying uncared for, the left arm broken, on a corner of the enclosed grounds of the temples in Mahakut. 7 One is from Bhita, the other from Kosam. A large lotus, which may be compared with the lotus flower of Fig. 3, covers the shoulders and part of the chest of the figure on the Bhita plaque; the upper row of petals is above the shoulders, where the neck would be; the womb is lotus-girt.

Although this lacks the terse vivaciousness, the central figure emerges in complete anthropomorphic shape. Flanked by two birds instead of the lions and standing on a central 'floral' support, the figure draws to itself the long lotus stalks and the large flowers are upheld by its hands to either side of the diademed head. It is crowned by two large lotus buds and a small rosette between them.8 The figure here is male. A knee-length dhoti, draped around the thighs, shows its long end gathered and tucked in front. Related to these two roundels in Sanchi is one more circular panel, from the railing of the Stiipa of Barhut of the first century B. C. (Fig. 6). The winged quadrupeds here have well- toothed monster's heads, a lotus flower occupies the root position in the centre. From the cup-like pericarp a small leafy tree emerges in front of a leaf-like flame, the central, non-iconic device of this composition. Before entering into the underlying theme of these different sculptures in which the lotus occupies a central place, two painted potsherds from Mohenjodaro with a circle of lotus petals around the necks should be mentioned, for they seem to suggest in their own terms the pleni- tude and meaning of the image at Alampur with the lotus at its neck. In Barhut of the ist century B. C., and particularly in Sanchi, on the gateways of the Ist century A. D., certain representations frequently occupy the same places. They would appear to be sculptural synonyms. In some of them, the center is occupied by a round pot, the "purna ghata", from which lotus flowers emerge; in others, the anthropomorphic equivalent is a female figure, standing or seated on an expanded lotus flower, holding a lotus flower in her raised hand, and surrounded by flowering stems and growing leaves.Io These latter composi- tions are well established iconographic types of the Goddess Sri or Laksmi. In none of them does she have a lotus in place of her head and she is never in the birth position. The lotus flower crowns the body of the images of Mahakut and Alampur. In Alampur, the lotus is comprised within the outline of the body; it connects the curves of the shoulders (Figs. i-2). It is edged and supported by the large lotus buds that converge on it from the hands of the image whereas in the image in Mahakut (Fig. 3) the lotus faces upward and exceeds the shoulders in height. In the image at Alampur, the filaments of the flower are not shown, but only the double row of petals, and possibly the centre and tip of the pericarp of the large, delicate and somewhat tired flower. The curves of the petals communicate the essence of their fragrance, just when the flower begins to fade. The vigour that had been in the petals is drawn inward, into the pericarp where the cycle of the lotus life begins anew. That is where the forefingers point to and where the large lotus buds are laid on with their soft, sheltering, fleshy shapes. 8 The small shape between the large lotus buds of Plates I-III could neither be identified on the image nor in its photo- graphs. 9 Sir John Marshall, Mohenjo-daro and the Indus Civilisation, Vol. III, Pls. LXXXVII 3 and XC 25. One side of a sealing from Harappa (op. cit., I, P1. XII, 12, pp. 52, 70) shows an inverted female figure with knees wide apart, hands resting on knees, and a tree-like plant issuing upside down from the womb. 10 A. K. Coomaraswamy, Early Indian Iconograpy, Pt. II. "Eastern Art" Vol. I., . 8,p distinguishes accordingly, three varieties of the image of Laksmi, i) with lotus in hand, padma-hasta; 2) padmasana, or padmapitha, the lotus seat or lotus on which Sri Laksmi rests and 3) Laksmi as the dweller in the lotus, 'padmavasini, kamalalaya'. 263</page><page sequence="6">Embedded and floating on the surging modelled mass, the lotus crowns the woman who is all body, gravid mass, akin to that of the palaeolithic Venus from WNillendorf who, though she has a head of hair, is without a face. And there are Cycladic images whose rarified, exten- sive body has no head at all. For the mother goddess is altogether body, incarnate, purposive potentiality whose fulfilment, the womb, is between the symmetry, right and left, of the two breasts, hands, and legs. In one line from the centre, over the roundnesses of the hill of the abdomen, lies the sheltered bank above, where the lotus rests and guards its secret, behind a double wreath of petals, locked by the bead chain, the only ornament laid on the body itself. Close by, laterally, on the armlet, the head of a serpent is raised." The image in Mahakut which has a lotus for its head may be compared to images that have either human or animal heads. The human head, though it may be carved without a face, is the seat of consciousness and has its support in the body. The animal head in sculpture, makes its carrier, the human body, into a support of its inhuman, more than human, power, that of the animal creation-which preceded men. Earlier still, in the hierarchy of creation, is the plant world. The innocence in the power of vegetation and the innocence of the animal shine forth from their shapes as formed in Indian art.'2 They are worthy to be carried by the body of man and with it conjointly convey a realisation of divinity felt and known through the body, seen and felt in animal and plant, and thence placed at the seat of consciousness. India's foremost sacred plant is the lotus.I3 It flowers on and above the surface of the water, rising from the mud under the water. The flower opens to the sun and closes in the evening. Other varieties of the lotus, however, respond to the moon, open at night and are closed in the day. With its root in the mud, its stalk traversing the entire depth of the waters on which it rests its leaves, its flower open to the light of heaven, the lotus belongs to this world and those below and above, to Light, Earth and Water. Its open flower emits a fragrance of the subtlest vibrations;14 the petals, whatever their colour, gleam with crystal freshness, their opening and closing fans into ripeness the seeds in the pericarp. It is seed pod, womb and ground of the new plants, and on its high level of perfected beauty it holds the mystery of the lotus. This wondrous plant, having its being in earth, water, and light, enacts their transmuta- II Another instance of the connection of serpent and lotus, in the iconography of Sri-Laksmi in particular, are the Nagas amidst lotuses in the lower part of the rock-cut panel of Sri-Laksmi in the Ravana-ka-khai cave, Elura, A. K. Coomaras- wamy, Yaksas, II. P1. 24. 12 Brhad-dharma, ch. 48. Siva cut off the head of Daksa, for the offence he had committed of excluding Siva from the Sacrifice. Siva then says, "Fix the head of an animal on Daksa. It will be sinless and replace his sinful face". Daksa was given the head of a Ram or Goat. 13 From the days of the "Indus valley" civilisation, in the 3rd millennium B. C. where the lotus as a conventionalized, geometrical pattern is painted on the underside of the bowl of an offering stand, the lotus flower is a perennial symbol of Indian art. The circular lotus pattern painted in Mohenjo-daro, is similar in its mature stylisation to the carved versions of the lotus petals on Mauryan pillars (Mohenjo-daro, op. cit. P1. LXXXVII. 3) whereas the abbreviated version (ib. P1. CX. 25) is more closely connected with carvings of Stupa II, Sanchi, and in Barhut, with paintings on the vault of Cave IX, Ajanta, and with carvings on fountain stones of Chamba. Sir John Marshall, op. cit. Vol. II. pp. 321 and 329, considers the design on the underside of these two pans as quite unusual. "It may have been derived from a flower or from fluted metal work." But no fluted metal work has been found in Mohenjo-daro, the designs moreover do not resemble the fluted metal work found in Kish, Cemetery A, to which Sir John Marshall refers (See Mackay, "Report on the Excavation of the 'A' cemetery at Kish", P1. LVII. I3.). 14 Gandha, scent is known to be the subtle essence of the element Earth, as Rasa, flavour, is that of Water. 264</page><page sequence="7">tion from earth to light, from mud to sent, through water to gleaming colour in the regu- larity of its shape, not only ordered as it is in all the directions of space, but also in the re- gularity of ity s movement, opening and closing with the measure of time, of days and nights. With this series of functions a synthesis is effected of elements and forms of the cosmos, whereas the processes contained in the pericarp on high refer to the mysteries of generation. When the seeds of other sorts of plant are ripe, the bursting of the pod releases them, and they fall to the ground and germinate. It is otherwise with the lotus. The ripe seeds, instead of falling from the pod, remain in the cells where they have grown. Within these cells, whose openings are too small to let them out, the seeds send forth the young seedlings. The seed pod is their matrix until they are large enough to burst open their cells. The seedlings then sink to the bottom of the water where they take root in the mud. Within the flower the reproductive power has its seat. There, high above the muddy ground, above the water, the whole cycle of vegetation is accomplished. Within the pericarp is held the continuity from bud to fruit and again to the new, young plant, the beginning and the end and the new beginning once more. The centre of productivity and the cycle of generation reside above, in the flower. The earth below, the mud, is but the intermediate ground for the root. Productivity and generation above, are one continuous process within the lotus flower. When the lotus flower is supported, not by its stalk in nature, but on the female body in art, the place of productivity and generation is also that of consciousness, which resides in the head, and which is concentrated in the several subtle centres (cakra) situated there. As the lotus extends over the region of the throat, it occupies the Visuddhi cakra, the subtle centre in the throat region, in the image at Alampur particularly (Figs. i-2). Each of these centres or cakras is visualized in the shape of a lotus. Its name conveys its meaning. The lotus situated in the throat, Visuddhi cakra or centre of Great Purity, is realized as the door to liberation, for there the four Vedas are known, together with their secret meaning. The throat, whence the vibra- tion which causes speech is exteriorized in man, the microcosm, as articulate voice, the Visuddhi cakra, is the place for the manifestation of the Word, in its universal macrocosmic reference. The Word is Veda, sum total of all Knowledge. From the Word was brought forth the Uni- verse.16 Supported by the entire figure, on top of her body is the place of the lotus, the place of the Birth of the Universe. Below, the figure is shown in the physical position of giving birth, above she is herself once more the giver of life, as lotus, the Word that was in the beginning, genetrix of all that exists in the cosmos, genetrix once more of what is manifest as embodied cosmic consciousness. For the image is that of the Birth-giving mother in her shape as woman and in her shape as lotus, one in function and artistic vision, but dual in shape and in the hierarchy of meaning, offering her being to be beheld and worshipped as Goddess. The image at Alampur lies flat on her back, on a raised plinth, on an altar which she completely fills. She herself is this altar. She is the birth-giving mother. If head and face establish the identity of a person, she who has neither head nor face but a lotus instead is the lotus, Padma, foremost of all plants in India. "Plants, 0 ye Mothers, I hail you as Goddesses" (Yajur V. IV. 2. 6). The nourishing, life-giving, 15 Sivasamhita, 5. 117. 16 Manusmrti I. 21. 265</page><page sequence="8">life-saving plants are mothers; in their miraculous power they are goddesses. In a physical sense, the Earth (Prthivi) is the mother of plants and herbs, the all-producer (Atharva Veda XII. I. 17). She is this earth "on whose surface they enclose the altar" (Atharva Veda XII. I. 13). As large asis this Earth, so large is the altar (R. V. I. 64. 35; X. IIo. 4 Satapatha Brahmana III. 7. 2. I; IX. 4. 2. 3. XII. 8. 2. 36; etc.). This whole earth is one place of sacrifice, of trans- mutation of the lower earthly man into the higher spiritual man, and of attaining by sacrifice to the realm of the spirit, to heaven, while yet remaining firmly on this earth. So Mother Earth (Atharva Veda XII. I. 12) is invoked, as She who bears plants, that She, Prthivi (the wide one), may spread wide and favour us (AV. XII. i. 2). The image as altar (Figs. i, 2) is the place of new birth- of which the mother is the figure and the lotus te symbol. Images vested in architecture and nature overlap, in the total con- figuration, colourful transparencies of the meaning that encompasses and surpasses them. It is said a e that herbs and plants of which he lotus is the foremost-were "born first". The mea- ning here is not that of an event in time but of a prefiguration in those cycles of creation of causal images which do not lie within any time; they are known as timeless prefiguration of those essences, which were to convey their meaning through the fragrance and shape of flowers and plants long before the conception of gods. "The plants which were born first, three ages before the gods" (Rg Veda X. 97. I), are prefigurative thought-forms. In the order of con- ceptual seeing or image-making, the essence to which the plants are to give substance is a mind-conceived reality which precedes that of the gods. At the stage of the making of concrete images (murti), the "preceding" conceptual strata, in their causal and archetypal existence, though they are layered, are transparent. They imply and evoke each other. The architectural form, the altar, as in Alampur, bases its symbolic suggestiveness on its horizontal extent which is spread out like the surface of the earth, Prthivi, the "broad one". As Mother Earth, Prthivi is the archetypal "altar".17 In the sculpture at Alampur, the female shape carries the lotus in one line with her sex. Her generative power is along her middle line. On either side of it her width is spread. But when, for reasons of ritual requirement, the object used is of vertical extent, like the offering stands of the Harappa civilisation, the Head lotus is expanded towards the sky, as it also appears on the upright image at Mahakut (Fig. 3), with the difference that the petals of the Mohenjo-daro lotus, painted on the underside of the pan or bowl of offering, formed a complete circle. And where the lotus is part of a capital of a pillar, the symbolism of this shape belongs to the same order, in all the varieties of its form and their particular applications. In this instance the petals of the upward-facing lotus are turned down- ward, as are those of the lower set, above the necklace, of the image at Alampur. Other ad- justments of the head-lotus to its presentation with the image are the halo (Sirascakra) in which the lotus is shown at the back of the head, generally as part of a stele, and also the lotus disc at the back of the head of South Indian metal images of divinities - where the anthropomorphic, divine head is the "face" of the image.18 17 Prthivi is derived from prthu which means "broad". 18 Re the Lotus-halo, see H. Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia, Pls. 100, 101, io8 b. The lotus above the image is carved also at the more or less pointed top of the back slab of the stele where, however, the "Kirttimukha" or Face of Glory frequently takes its place. The same vicarious occupancy of a significant position on the monument by the lotus (of earlier occurrence) and the Kirttimukha which takes its place, gives special emphasis to the Sikhara of Hindu temples z66</page><page sequence="9">A lotus, in the two images (Figs. I-3), is also held in either of the two hands. The images are "padmahasta", in addition to being "padminana" or "lotus-faced", as the goddess Sri is described in the Srisukta.19 A lotus, "the nectarine essence of the Waters", is generally held by Laksmi, the mother of this entire Earth, in her right hand where it also signifies one of the two oceans, that is the ocean of the upper region in contrast to the ocean that girds the earth and is symbolised by the conch shell.20 Throughout the history of Indian sculpture, the Goddess Laksmi, the Auspicious, whose name is also Sri, the Beautiful, is represented as holding a lotus, occupying a lotus, as her seat or stand, and surrounded by lotuses. This goddess, in Indian iconography, is frequently the centre of the Lotus configuration, and her perimeter is a kind of lotus scene. The image at Alampur (Figs. I, 2) does not hold full, open lotuses. The buds, which are closed, seem just then only to have acquired their pointed shape, petals and sepals have not as yet separated. They are nascent buds in which the embryonic seed pod is hidden. The lotus buds are not held aloft on either side of the body. Their curve extends the arc of the bent arms of the image upward from the knees. With this movement they reach to the apex of the central lotus flower as if in a rite of insemination. With great tenderness they are laid down by the large hands of the image and their serpentine fingers; they meet, support and are part of one central, crowning lotus configuration, closing the cycle of the flower, sealing the sculpture of the Genetrix as one self-contained form of the widest symbolical connotation. Viewed as form, the mass of the sculpture appears replete with the vastness of its concep- tion. This mass, carved in stone, is modelled throughout. The quality of the modelling is an intrinsic one, bringing to the surface of the relief the movement which sustains and pervades the curved planes of the image. They are fastened to and bounded by the square level of the altar. This seems to have risen up in the likeness of a gigantic female body, incorporating its shape and binding it by its square limit. The two conceptions, the "anthropomorphic" and the architectural are fused. They are not adjusted to one another, but constitute a formal unity. Spread within, and coerced by the square limit of the base, the mass rises with curves which are as tense as they are elastic. Their arcs hold the tidal waves of the life-giving body. Its boundless abundance is stemmed by the square field of the relief. The overall conception of altar and life-giving body imparts monumental calm to the modelling. It is accentuated by a greater frequency of vibration in the modelling of the upturned soles, suggestive of muscular contractions in the agony of giving birth. Whose is the life-giving image? Although related to that of LaksmizI it is not this goddess whom the great master of Alampur bodied forth. Here is a deeper message and a more primal above the point where the roof of the porch terminates. The skyline of the subsidiary buildings must not exceed in height this particular point. Analogously too, lotus and Kirttimukha are the main frontal or top ornaments of the crown of divinities. Their signifi- cance at these places is elaborated in the various schools of sculpture. The lotus which stands for divinity and is that divinity as made by art belongs also to Egypt. There it represents the god Nefertem; or else the lotus is shown above the head of the good who arose from the primal Water (Nun), who arose from Earth, cf. S. Morenz, Der Gott auf der Blume, pp. 16-2I, P1. I. (Ascona 1954). 19 Sri-Suikta 25, in Pafcamrtadhyabhiseka Sukta. - Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Rg Veda, p. 79. 20 Visnudharmottara III. ch. 82. i-i6. 21 The image of the Goddess Mother Sri, Sirima Devata, in Barhut comes nearest to the shape of a "Mother Goddess". See L. Bachhofer, Early Indian Sculpture, P1. 21. 267</page><page sequence="10">vision. Like Laksmi, she is the All-Mother, born of the Waters- by which she appears sur- rounded- floating on them on her altar, during worship. Like Laksmi, her shape is that of "our Lady of Abundance", who is hymned in the Sri-sikta, as of the lotus-face and lotus- thigh (padma-uru); the juxtaposition of these two of her lotus parts stresses their correspon- dence in the sculpture at Alampur.22 Like Sri of the hymn, her sculptured form is "ardra" (Sri Sukta 4; 14) which means "billowing" as form and also "wet", in her element the water, the water on which her lotuses float. And she is Earth, Prthivi, the Broad one, spread on the water,23 the support of all living beings (Sri-suikta 9). For She "who at first was Water in the Ocean" Prthivi, the Broad one, is invoked in the Atharva Veda, in her centre and navel, with all the forces that have issued from her body, to set us amid those forces. "I am the son of Earth, Earth is my mother."24 But this Earth is the ground, the support of all existence, the all-sustaining. Abiding thus in the substantial and concrete aspect of the all-sustaining Mother, the Universe is ever borne along and supported by her. "Thou art the Earth, the ground, thou art the all-sustaining Aditi, she who supports all the World."25 She, the wide one, the capa- cious, widely spread,26 bounteous Earth, is most truly, actively herself when "spreading wide", she is shown giving birth to all that is. "In the first age of the gods the existent was born from the non-existent. After this the regions were born. This [existent] was born of her with the legs spread open (uttanapad). The World was born of her with the legs spread open. From Aditi Daksa was born and from Daksa Aditi" (Rg Veda X. 72. 3-4). And it is Aditi whom the singer of the hymn of the Atharva Veda invokes as the Vessel that contained all beings, she who is granter of the wish, the far spreading, Earth, my mother."27 As Mother Earth, who never lets down,28 whose lap holds all succour29 and life immortal,30 her navel is the centre of the earth.31 This earth, to the ancients was but one large altar- for "as large as is this altar, so large is the earth",32 one sacrificial place where man is restored to primordial unity. The sacrifice is the navel of the Universe, the navel of the Mother where in the beginning we were together, the place also where Aditi is invoked to restore this our rela- tion. 33 Aditi, Mother Earth, is ritually the altar, who bears in her womb the Sacrificial Fire.34 "May Aditi in her womb bear Agni as a mother in her lap, her son" (Yajur Veda XI. 57). As Altar and Womb, the image of Aditi (Figs. i, 2) faces upward. The image is laved ri- tually by the water for which the sculpture provides rim and outlet. Symbolically it is the same water in which the gods danced in the beginning. The gods, born after Aditi was born, 22 Sri-sfkta, 17 a; Scheftelowitz, op. cit. p. 77. 23 Satapatha Brahmana VII. 4. i. 8. 24 Atharva Veda XII. I. 8-i2. 25 Vajasaneyi Samhita, XIII. I8. 26 V. S.

As Earth, Womb and Altar, the image of Aditi is surrounded by the Waters. The lotus flowers on them. The lotus, symbol of creativeness, blooms above the waters. They nourish and sustain the plant as the body of the goddess, whose lap holds the Elixir of life, the Water of Life, and the Spark of Life, the Fire, supports the lotus flower as her head. In these two centres of creati- veness dwell the meaning and the power of the goddess and her image as altar. The Navel of the Earth is borne by the womb of this boundless goddess3s who is receptacle and carrier of all "that is born and of all that is to be born" (1Rg Veda I. 89. io), including those who are re-born through the sacrifice. This is how Aditi's head is spoken of as Earth's place of sacri- fice (Yajur Veda IV. 22). The head of Aditi thus is a lotus, for the lotus flower is also above, in the sky, where the sun is at the Head of the Universe (Maitri Upanisad VI. i. 2). The Navel of the Earth is the centre, where the earthly heat is consumed on the sacrificial altar. This is the place of the animal sacrifice, of the creative commutation of animal heat in the flame of the sacrificial fire. There burns the terrestial Fire, Agni, in the flame of the Sacri- fice. But Agni has sprung from a lotus, "from the head of the Universe" (murdhno visvasya, Rg Veda VI. 6. I3). In these two centres, the impartite, guiltless36 Aditi is at one with her- self, the Great Mother. For "Aditi is heaven, Aditi is the Air, Aditi the Mother, the same also Father and Son" (Rg Veda I. 89. io). "From Aditi was born Daksa" (Rg Veda X. 72. 4).37 From the Genetrix, in the act of generation, is generated the activity of the act, the creator Spiritus, Daksa, the spiritual potency in the Universe. "The Non-Existent and the Existent are in the highest heaven at the birth of Daksa, in the lap of Aditi. Agni indeed is the First-born of the Law in the Primal Age" (Rg Veda X. 5. 7). The Father and the Son, creator Spiritus and the creative intellectual Fire are born in the highest heaven, at the head of the Universe, in the Lotus, in self-sufficient, self- effected, creative generation, simultaneous with the perennial generation that takes place in the womb of the Great impartite Goddess, at the first age of the gods. It is thus that her lotus head rests on her shoulders in that sinless state of prefigured life in which the plants are born, three ages before the gods.38 It it thus, too, that in a separate representation the birth of Agni is shown in the Lotus flower (Fig. 6), Agni who is the Son of the Great Mother, the Son of Aditi, and her Gift (Rg Veda I. I85. 3), the Light of Life and Consciousness. For it is sung of Aditi ,,Thought art thou, mind, intellect-Aditi, with a double head" (Yajur Veda IV. 9). The Lotus head of Aditi, placed on her shoulders, overlays her throat with its petals. There the subtle centre (cakra) of the articulate Voice is situated, of Speech and of the Word. As Vac, speech and Word, as microcosmic, articulate existence, and as Macrocosm, Aditi raises 35 RV. II. 40. 6. "Aditi, the Boundless" (anarva). 36 RV. I. 94. 5. Being at one within herself, the Boundless, Impartite is guiltless (anaga) and makes guiltless (RV. IV. 39. 3; I. I62. 22). The fetters of guilt and sin fall in her Boundlessness. 37 In a later text, at a phase when Brahma had taken the place of the creator-god, it is from his intellect that Daksa is known to have sprung. (Visnu Purana. I. 7. 7.) The birth from the seat of the intellect, from the head, like that of Pallas Athena from the head of Zeus, is equal in meaning to a tradition according to which Sri Laksmi was born on a lotus which had sprung from the forehead of Visnu (Mahabharata, XII. 59. 2253-4). Brahma borne on a lotus, sprung from the navel of Visnu. 38 The animal head of the gods similarly represents the state without guilt, of divinity, see note I2. 269</page><page sequence="12">her sinless lotus-head.39 She is Altar of the World, place of the Sacrifice, Genetrix who is Mother, Father and Son,40 potent, parturient body Vessel of Fire within the Water of Life, and she is laved by primeval waters, Lotus of self-renewal in the Impartite. Who "will give us back to the Great Aditi? May I see Mother and Father again" (IRg Veda I. 24. i). Through the Divine Fire of creation and by the flame of the Sacrifice we return to the lotus flower of guilt- less, impartite, self-sufficient Unity. "God Agni is the first of the immortals whose dear name we have in mind. He shall give us back to the Great Aditi. May I see Father and Mother again" (Rg Veda I. 24. 2). 39 The "double head" is also interpreted as "facing both ways, as speech does, for good and evil, now going to the gods, now to the Gandharvas" (cf. Aitareya Brahmana, I, 29). This concept however is not "in Aditi" but belongs to a subsequent stage of articulate speech having left the body of Aditi, the Impartite, the Sinless. The double head as lotus flower faces both ways, upward toward the macrocosm, and down toward the embodied creation (microcosm). 40 And also daughter, reborn in the intellectual act, of Daksa, the creator spiritus. 270</page></plain_text>
