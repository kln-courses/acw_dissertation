<plain_text><page sequence="1">J j JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES bl Vol. XI No. 4 December 1977 An Institutionalist View of Development Economics Philip A. Klein By common assent, the most significant visible impact of American in- stitutionalism has been in the field of what is now called development economics.' This relatively favorable assessment of the influence of insti- tutionalism in this increasingly important field is in rather considerable contrast to the prevailing impression concerning the impact of institution- alism on economics generally. Paul Samuelson, in his elementary text, dis- misses it with the comment that, "although Veblen and the Institutionalists had some followers in American academic life ... 40 years ago Institu- tionalism withered away as an effective counterforce in economics."2 It will be the argument of this article that despite the denial of the validity and/or relevance and usefulness of much of what institutionalism has to offer economics generally, in the field of development economics the victory has been so complete that many economists fail to realize it or to credit institutionalists with contributing any part of the current ana- lytical framework of development economics. This failure has wider im- plications as well. The author is Professor of Economics, The Pennsylvania State University, Uni- versity Park. He wishes to thank his colleague, Professor Warren C. Robinson, for his helpful comments. 785</page><page sequence="2">786 Philip A. Klein Modern Origins of Economic Development There are references to economic development throughout post-Adam Smith economics, but customarily economists tend to date its modern in- carnation to the days of reconstruction following World War II, when there was much ferment in the Third World and "what to do about the backward nations" was a popular topic for economic debate. At that time development usually referred to the quest by countries with low per capita levels of income to raise their levels. Thus, an early Samuelson definition: "An underdeveloped nation is simply one with real per capita income that is low relative to the present-day per capita incomes of such nations as Canada, the United States, Great Britain, France, and Western Europe generally. Usually an underdeveloped nation is one regarded as being capable of substantial improvement in its income level."3 Except that "underdeveloped" is now renamed "less developed," the definition is substantially unchanged in the tenth (1976) edition. Earlier basic texts, of course, ignored the subject.4 Therefore, while mainstream economics has had the problem of economic development in its modern form pushed to its attention for more than a quarter century, it early dealt with the subject with some confusion, which institutionalists should be able to explain. Simon Kuznets indicated the nature of the confusion a decade ago when he suggested that underdevelopment can signify (1) "failure to utilize fully the productive potential warranted by the existing state of technical knowledge-a failure resulting from the resistance of social institutions"; (2) "the backwardness of economic performance compared with a few leading countries"; and (3) "economic poverty in the sense of failure to assure subsistence and material comfort to most of the country's population."5 As Kuznets correctly points out, the first definition applies to most countries most of the time; many of the Third World countries made the problem acute by their qualification under the third definition; but the second is the working definition favored by most economists. The possibility of improvement in the per capita income levels is crucial because it suggests the possibility of change. Change is precisely where modern development begins; it is the fundamental premise, and it is what initially distinguishes development economics from the central thrust of mainstream equilibrium economics. Change enters mainstream economics, if at all, through the notion of "dynamic equilibrium," and that is a vastly different notion than the kind of change involved in develop- ment economics. One can argue with considerable cogency that this difference in initial premise is still far too little appreciated. Many econo- mists would argue more simply that modern development economics is</page><page sequence="3">Development Economics 787 merely the application of mainstream economics to the problems facing the new and/or industrializing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin Amer- ica. To so argue is to miss a critical point. We shall here maintain that the adjustments required in applying mainstream economics to development economics are precisely the sort that institutional economists have long advocated for economics generally. The widespread acceptance of the necessity for these adjustments by development economists is the reason it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish "mainstream" from "institutionalist" development economics. Some Crucial Definitions Immediately after World War II economists were fond of referring to "the backward countries" or "underdeveloped economies." Because these terms appear to have carried pejorative connotations, at least in the eyes of the countries so characterized, they have been replaced by "less devel- oped countries" (LDCs) or more often now "developing economies." As Kuznets pointed out,6 all economies are developing if for no other reason than that technology is always changing, just as resources are always be- ing discovered both in reaction to and as stimulus to changing technology, as well as because of the vagaries of "the instinct of workmanship" among geologists, chemists, and others. So what Western economists often mean by "developing economies" is assisting (or observing) Third World econo- mies in exploiting their own resources so as to adapt modern technology to a version of industrialization which is compatible with moving beyond agriculture alone and toward an industrialization which is believed pos- sible for them to achieve. The implications of this view of development will be explored shortly. Two other common terms are growth and de- velopment. They are customarily used in tandem (as in the title of Samuel- son's chapter 38, "Problems of Economic Growth and Development"7). The implication is clear, if not at the outset, then very soon thereafter. Growth refers to the rate by which real per capita income or output in- creases; underdeveloped economies have low real GNP per capita, and the process of development is a technique whereby the rate of increase in real per capita income and output can be speeded up. While the terms growth and development are, therefore, often used interchangeably, it can be argued that a good deal is lost thereby, and much is to be gained by differentiating them. Sherman Robinson, for example, recently wrote: " 'Economic growth' is defined as increases in aggregate product, either total or per capita, without reference to changes in the structure of the economy or in social and cultural value systems (which</page><page sequence="4">788 Philip A. Klein are called 'aggregate preference structures.'. . .'Economic development' is defined to include not only growth but also social and cultural changes which occur in the development process."8 In short, "growth" refers to mere quantitative increase in whatever the economy is currently doing. "Development" refers to directing the economy toward objectives which have both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. Hence, economies customarily-but not invariably-grow. Mainstream economists are us- ually comfortable coping with growth and consider the directing of growth one of their primary preoccupations. Development, as we shall see, is a very different matter. Why should this be the case? The Institutionalist Foundations of Modern Development Economics In his Theory of Business Enterprise Thorstein Veblen pitted the ma- chine process and the requirements of the industrial process against busi- ness enterprise motivated by pecuniary gain. It was dominance for long periods of the former by the latter which created the kind of tension cap- italist economies all exhibit.9 It was this notion, coupled with John Dewey's emphasis on "the means-end continuum" and the instrumental theory of value, that formed the core of Clarence Ayres's perspective. The relationship between technology and institutions permeated all of Ayres's work as, for example, his comment on Veblen: He conceived the economy as the system of related activities by which the people of any community get their living. This system embraces a body of knowledge and of skills and a stock of physical equipment; it also em- braces a complex network of personal relations reinforced by custom, ritual, sentiment, and dogma. This conception of the economy-one that is applicable to a paleolithic culture no less than to our own, and to our own no less than to any other-is Thorstein Veblen's principal bequest to succeeding generations.10 The hallmark by which institutional economics can be differentiated from mainstream economics is, therefore, that the economist qua econo- mist must pay attention to all of these factors. It is precisely here that main- stream economists prefer to part company with institutionalists. Peter Bauer and Basil Yamey, for example, commenting on the origins of modern development economics, write: There are no special economic theories or methods of analysis for the study of the underdeveloped world.... In the half century before the</page><page sequence="5">Development Economics 789 Second World War the advances in economic theory were largely in fields of equilibrium analysis.... The discussion was generally at a high level of abstraction, so much so, indeed, that the principal long term de- terminants of income and wealth, such as the factors underlying growth of capital, the size of population, the attitude toward work, saving and risk-bearing, the quality of entrepreneurship and the extent of markets, were considered as institutional facts given, as data, to the economist."' In short, precisely these factors which mainstream economists were most comfortable assuming as "given" were the crucial factors from which any study of development economics had to begin. The result was a change in the approach of development economists, a change carried out thus far without producing a corresponding change in the approach of other mainstream economists. The argument here is that development econo- mists embraced the fundamental tenets of institutionalism for their own specialty without calling it that, without influencing other mainstream economists (until, perhaps, relatively recently), and without institutional- ists themselves paying as much attention as they might have to what had happened, or to its significance. The dynamism of technological development, the resistance of institu- tions, the inevitability of change-these are basic elements of modern evo- lutionary economics. They are, for example, what Joseph Schumpeter had in mind when he distinguished invention (a technological process) from innovation (the incorporation of an invention into the business en- terprise economy) and noted that the process involved "creative destruc- tion."'12 What remains to be said, however, is that "creative destruction" or, if one prefers, economic change as a result of the confrontation of the essen- tial dynamism which characterizes technology with the institutional frame- work which provides at one and the same time both resistance to change and the requisite stability without which no society can function, is a ceaseless process. From that point of view the term underdeveloped is far less satisfactory than the term developing because the former connotes a static state, whereas the latter connotes a process. But the same comment can be made of the term developed. Kuznets is correct because, in the Veblen-Ayres tradition, he recognizes that all economies are in process of change at all times. In precisely the same way that Dewey's means-end continuum provided the most appropriate undergirding for what Ayres liked to call the instrumental theory of value, modern economics could benefit from acceptance of the notion that industrialization is not a pro- cess with a finite end. Indeed, the value problems with which "developed"</page><page sequence="6">790 Philip A. Klein economies are currently wrestling exist precisely because the develop- ment process is on-going and presents them, therefore, with problems that could be more amenable to analysis and possibly even resolution were we all to stop regarding the task confronting "underdeveloped" countries as primarily one of achieving for themselves the closest possible approxima- tion to our own current state. Is There an Institutional Theory of Growth? The implications of the preceding discussion for growth theory are im- portant. Not only is there an institutional theory of growth, but also, how- ever else they may differ, all widely espoused growth theories must begin from an institutionalist perspective. "Growth theory" here, following but extending a distinction made by John R. Hicks, refers to the process by which economies change and develop over time rather than what main- stream economists mean by the term when they discuss "dynamic eco- nomics." Thus, Hicks is able to write: "Underdevelopment economics is a vastly important subject, but it is not a formal or theoretical subject. It is a practical subject which must expect to call upon any branch of theory (including non-economic, for instance sociological, theory) which has any relevance to it."'13 He then proceeds to make it clear that the former is not his concern-he means economic dynamics, a far more circumscribed endeavor. The analysis of equilibrium, whether static or dynamic, has never received high priority among evolutionary economists, and so the question of whether there is an institutional growth theory is here ad- dressed to the larger view of growth. It will be argued that development economists are essentially institutionalist whether they know it or not, and thus many of them may find that, like Moliere's bourgeois gentil- homme, who was surprised to discover he had been speaking prose all his life, they may always have been writing institutional economics with- out knowing it. Several years ago A. W. Coats argued that institutionalism must mean more than that "social and cultural influences play a crucial role in the process of economic development."114 Surely it does. Institutionalism em- bodies a fundamental notion of the economy, namely, an institution as a dynamic entity is subject to influences far broader than "the market" with all its attendant givens. Coats went on to suggest that it would be inter- esting to compare the contents of the Journal of Economic Issues with that, for example, of Economic Development and Cultural Change for clues as to the degree to which institutionalism can be differentiated from main-</page><page sequence="7">Development Economics 791 stream economics.15 The term "institutionalist growth theory" is rarely en- countered even in the JEI.16 Still, Coats's notion is a reasonable one. Do writers in the JEI mean something different by the terms "economic growth" or "economic development" than do other economists in the de- velopment field? My conclusion, based on something less than an exhaus- tive analysis of both journals, is negative, with the possible exception of one area. Progress in Development Economics In general, work in economic development in the past quarter century has taken one of two directions; either it has been an effort to further our understanding of the development process through case studies of par- ticular economies in process of development, or it has been an attempt to further our understanding by refinements in development theory in general. Often the former involve consideration of obstacles to industrial- ization. These efforts appear in a variety of publications, of course, but my contention here, following Coats's suggestion, is that customarily it is impossible to guess a priori whether they would be published in the Journal of Economic Issues or in "mainstream" publications typified by Economic Development and Cultural Change according to the method the studies adopt or their general thrust. A number of members of the Association for Evolutionary Economics have themselves published in Economic De- velopment and Cultural Change, among them Clarence Ayres,17 Karl de Schweinitz,18 William Glade,19 Abraham Hirsch,20 K. William Kapp,2' Peter McLaughlin,22 Robert A. Solo,23 and W. Paul Strassmann.24 Most of these articles have been case studies, but the critical point is that they might with equal logic have appeared in the Journal of Economic Issues. Economic Development and Cultural Change is the house organ of the University of Chicago in the field of development economics, just as the JEI bears that relationship to the Association of Evolutionary Economics. The distinctions in emphasis, point of view, subject matter, and policy orientation between the two journals as regards development economics are relatively minor in my opinion precisely because the divisions in the development field (and there are a number) do not follow the customary division between establishment economics (where the University of Chi- cago and its Journal of Political Economy can surely be placed in the fore- front) and evolutionary economics. Corroboration of this position as well as suggesting its implications are the subjects of the remainder of this article.</page><page sequence="8">792 Philip A. Klein The Journal of Economic Issues and Development Economics JEI Case Studies What have been the concerns of development economists writing in the Journal of Economic Issues? There have, to begin with, been a number of case studies involving various countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin Amer- ica in process of developing. We shall cite several of these, commenting as necessary in order to show that their general perspectives, as well as their method and conclusions, do not clearly distinguish them from other case studies in economic development appearing in journals such as Economic Development and Cultural Change, which do not purport to be institu- tionalist. We shall endeavor to substantiate the conclusion that all such studies are essentially institutionalist of necessity because they concern themselves with some aspect of the clash between dynamic technology and institutional barriers to economic change and/or with the implications of economic development for the overall direction in which a particular de- veloping economy is moving. To conclude that a particular case study is "not institutionalist" is another way of saying that it cannot be differenti- ated from case studies in economic development generally, because the field itself is institutionalist. One such study involved the comparison of economic development in Mexico and Thailand, concentrating on the difficulty of grafting Western methods and objectives onto countries with different institutions. While the study (in two parts) was subtitled "An Institutional Analysis," it is not notably institutionalist except insofar as it is concerned with the juxta- position of modern technology to the diverse institutions of developing economies. But this is precisely what almost all modern development economics is concerned with, no doubt in response to the relatively sim- plistic notion after World War II that an infusion of Western technology and/or money was all that backward economies needed "to develop."25 The articles, in short, are a contribution to development economics ap- pearing in the pages of the Journal of Economic Issues but cannot be said to have attempted to differentiate an institutionalist development theory from standard development theory. The reason, to repeat, it is argued here, is because such a distinction, with the exception of one possible area, discussed below, cannot easily be made. There have, of course, been many similar case studies published in the JEI. Indeed, almost half of its issues have contained one or more articles on problems of economic development. Because, with few exceptions,</page><page sequence="9">Development Economics 793 they have not attempted a differentiation of institutionalist from main- stream development economics, they would in principle be as appropriate in Economic Development and Cultural Change (EDCC) as in the JEI. Among these one could include Glade's "The Employment Question and Development Policies in Latin America" and Milton Lower's "In- stitutional Bases of Economic Stagnation in Chile."26 Glade's study is a straightforward attempt to describe the employment aspects of Latin American development policy; it is not more or less institutionalist than most such studies wherever they have been published. Lower purports from the onset to explain Chilean stagnation from an Ayres-Veblen per- spective: Technology, conceived of as a universalistic process of accumulation and assimilation of tools and knowledge is the dynamic force in economic development and cultural change. To account for a past or present in- stance of sustained development would require a heavy emphasis upon what might be called its "technological bases," though it would also require some independent explanation of the relative permissiveness of the institutions in the face of this advancing "cultural incidence of the machine process."27 This is, of course, a familiar notion to institutional economists, inter- esting as well because it incorporates the title of Chicago's economic de- velopment journal. The article itself considers the institutional difficulties involved in Chilean economic development and concludes ultimately that although "the institutional barriers that must yet be overcome are awe- some, . . . there is ground for cautious optimism."28 The case study, there- fore, makes a contribution to understanding problems of economic de- velopment but not, it would appear, to distinguishing institutionalist development theory from standard or establishment development theory. Thomas De Gregori, to cite one more study, examined post-war British colonial Africa and concluded that experience there "has clearly shown us that capital or foreign investment alone cannot engender development."29 This conclusion is one widely reached by development economists and, while important, again provides no basis for distinguishing institutionalist from standard development economics. General Studies in Development In addition to these case studies, there have been a number of contribu- tions in the Journal of Economic Issues to the general theoretical literature of development economics. Some of these have concerned themselves with general problems of development or stabilizing relationships between</page><page sequence="10">794 Philip A. Klein developed and developing economies. Deena Khatkhate, for example, wrote an article suggesting that a system of dual exchange rates could pro- vide useful interim assistance in the development process.30 Whatever the merits of the argument, it is clearly general in nature and no more (or less) "standard" than institutionalist. Similarly, William Miller has written on the general question of the role of education in economic development, discussing a number of con- troversies concerning current views on the subject but not readily classifi- able as "institutionalist" as opposed to "standard." The writers whose views he analyzes are development economists generally, and the article, in principle, could appear anywhere.31 The same can be said of Robert Alexander's discussion of import-substitution strategy or W. T. Wilford's examination of the relation between nutrition levels and economic devel- opment.32 Mention may be made similarly of Solo's examination of the hypothesis that low wages in developing countries lead to a trade-off favor- ing relatively labor-intensive technologies.33 All these studies, in terms of both approach and subject, would in principle be as appropriate to Eco- nomic Development and Cultural Change as they are to the Journal of Economic Issues. Much the same conclusion is appropriate for William Thweatt's study of world poverty and the continued increase in the gap between the income levels of the richer and poorer nations.34 Finally, Steven Barsby has examined Alexander Gerschenkron's hy- potheses concerning generalizing Western Europe's growth experience to other countries. Barsby considers the United States, Canada, Japan, Aus- tralia, and South Africa. His attempt to refute Gerschenkron by suggesting that the Western European growth experience can indeed be generalized to other countries is interesting, but like the other studies cited, only with tortuous difficulty can it be classified as "institutionalist" rather than "mainstream."35 It is no doubt true that evolutionary economists are more likely than others-even other development economists-to make specific reference to Ayres or Veblen. Some studies state that they will concern themselves with some aspect of Veblenian or Ayresian theory, but in the final analysis they are not noticeably different from conventional development eco- nomics. (The reader will recall, however, that we are here arguing that this is because the mainstream of development economics is institutional- iSt.36) A number of economists have examined the general problem of techno- logical change and diffusion, often in terminology which might disturb "nondevelopment" institutionalists, but this is clearly a major area where development economics must be and is institutionalist, with no clear way</page><page sequence="11">Development Economics 795 to distinguish the mainstream from evolutionary economics. For example, James Christian's study of institutional alterations required by changing technology is surely supremely Ayresian in point of view, but the meth- odology and terminology are derived from mainstream economics with results that can only be viewed as an effort to contribute to evolutionary development theory.37 Similar concern with the obstacles to diffusion is expressed by James Street in his study of the Latin American technological frontier. He writes from a far more explicitly institutionalist perspective than does Christian, but his study is not radically different, except for some terminology, from the work of other development economists (both in the JEI and else- where) on the subject.38 The Role of Savings In one area some have attempted to argue in the JEI that there exists an institutionalist as opposed to a mainstream position in economic devel- opment. It concerns the role of savings in economic growth and develop- ment. Primary participants in this controversy appear to be Louis Junker, Street, and De Gregori,39 although others have commented on the matter. The issue is customarily expressed in terms of whether or not an in- crease in savings is a prerequisite for an increase in the growth rate. While the question is here applied to less developed countries, it can, of course, with equal logic be applied to any economy. This question is scarcely new in economics. If we go back no farther than J. M. Keynes, his basic system, C+?I=Y (1) Y-C=S, (2) I = S, (3) would suggest at least two ways to increase the rate of investment. One could reduce consumption and so increase savings which might be in- vested. Or one could increase the income level with consumption un- changed, and so provide increase in savings and investment. The mathe- matics is identical, but the economics radically different, and it is around this that the controversy appears to revolve. Junker stated the matter clearly by suggesting that Joan Robinson had indeed posed the critical question relating to development theory, and it was concerned essentially with capital theory. Asked Robinson: "What governs the overall rate of accumulation of capital?"40 Her answer was</page><page sequence="12">796 Philip A. Klein that in contrast to far better known theories of capital accumulation, "there is a less well-known theory that seems more promising. This is put forward by a disciple of Veblen, Professor C. E. Ayres."'4' It is Junker's contention that there is an institutionalist theory of capital accumulation which can be differentiated from the standard theory. How treacherous the categories and the terminology can be in this area is illustrated by Junker's decision to use Robert Heilbroner's argument in The Great As- cent as typifying the standard theory that the inability of poor countries to accumulate capital is their basic obstacle to development and growth. The argument continues that the inability to accumulate capital is due to the inability to save when the level of economic activity is at or near the subsistence level.42 Junker thus views Heilbroner as representative of many development economists on this matter. He specifically names Bauer and Yamey, Irma Adelman, Barbara Ward, and Henry Bruton as having ensnared them- selves somehow or other in the "low-level equilibrium trap"-without saving there can be no growth, and economic performance is at too low a level to permit any saving. In Junker's opinion, Robinson's view of capital, how it is accumulated, and the relationship of capital accumulation to economic growth is far closer to an appropriate nonsavings centered theory of economic development. Others whom Junker sees as on the right track include A. K. Cairncross, John P. Lewis, and Wendell Gordon.43 Junker's essential argument is that the factors which permit growth to accelerate create a whole constellation of dynamic changes among which increase in savings is one, and the chain of causation runs from these factors to changes in savings, not the other way around. Indeed, a priori, an in- crease in savings alone might well depress investment incentive because it would indicate a diminution in the consumption rate. This is also Rob- inson's argument, and a number of other economic theorists in general as well as development economics have joined in the debate. Street underscores the same issue in his effort to prove that the overall approach of Latin American "structuralists" parallels that of North Amer- ican institutionalists. Ayres's view concerning the inadequacy of "the ab- stinence theory of capital formation" discussed in The Theory of Eco- nomic Progress has, in Street's view, been echoed more recently in the views of the Latin American structuralists: "While denied by experience, the idea persists that the only way a people can raise the necessary invest- ment funds to insure their own industrial expansion is by a prior and wide- spread reduction in the level of consumption. Somehow, as a principle, this idea has escaped the Keynesian as well as the institutional on- slaught."X44</page><page sequence="13">Development Economics 797 This is the essential thrust as well of De Gregori's insistence about the "wrongheadedness" of the view that savings is necessary for economic development.45 Wendell Gordon finally has joined the debate, arguing that the view that "the institutional adjustment problem . .. is an insuper- able barrier to . .. fostering economic development" is itself part of the explanation for the slowness of development since World War II.46 While there is a certain ambiguity to Gordon's argument as he originally stated it, eventually it becomes clear. He writes that the attitude which regards raising the rate of saving as an "impossible task" is one of the barriers to growth, but he does not appear to be suggesting that the necessity to raise the rate of saving as a prerequisite to growth is invalid.47 The rest of his argument seems unambiguous and is very much what one expects of an institutionalist-technology (the accumulation of knowledge) is dynamic, its implementation involves overcoming "firmly entrenched domestic in- stitutional resistance," and, finally, "one of the real contributions of Keynesian theory was its demonstration that prior personal monetary sav- ing is not necessary to set moving the wheels of investment, production, rising income, and rising welfare."48 All this leaves the savings question, narrowly construed, and its relation to institutional economics somewhat confused. As Alan Nichols (a non- institutionalist who has written for the JEI) has aptly noted in commenting on Junker's discussion on the savings question, if Professor Junker means that private savings, both domestically and through international transfer, are not up to the job of economic develop- ment, we may nod, though for the nth time, in agreement. If he means that know-how is indispensable, who will dissent? If he means that "cul- tural patterns" can be an obstacle, how can we say otherwise? But if he means that savings as understood by nearly everyone in the profession are not required, I must suggest that he believes that he has found a very cheap way indeed to development. And he really ought to tell us about it.49 What is one to make of all this? Part of the problem is the ambiguity over "savings as understood by nearly everyone." Gordon in the previous quotation is careful to refer to his interpretation that Keynes believed "prior personal monetary saving is not necessary" for development. Junker and Street seem to have attacked the notion that increased real saving (real reductions in consumption) are a prerequisite to capital ac- cumulation and increases in the growth rate. In short, if one wishes to argue that an implication of the Veblen-Ayres views on economic progress is that the way to increase economic growth rates depends primarily on adjusting institutions to changing technology so as to establish the ferment</page><page sequence="14">798 Philip A. Klein from which both increase in consumption and investment emerge (the Junker-Street position, I think), then one must conclude that Gordon's position is ambiguous, Nichols and Heilbroner are probably in disagree- ment, and Robinson may well side with Junker and Street. De Gregori, as we have seen, argues that the savings-is-necessary-for-development posi- tion is "wrongheaded," but in an earlier article on economic development in British colonial Africa he takes a middle position, saying that "it is pos- sible if not probable that current emphasis on saving and foreign invest- ment may be misplaced" as prime factors in increasing economic growth. "An economic policy that encourages domestic saving and foreign invest- ment is frequently aligned with a political and social oligarchy that re- stricts the utilization of modern technology."50 This much would be clear to all. But what if "an economic policy that encourages domestic saving" were aligned with otherwise ideal dynamic social and political institutions sympathetic to introducing new technology? De Gregori's later article would appear to argue that such a savings policy would nonetheless be "wrongheaded," but in the British Africa article he does not say, stating only that emphasis on savings may "possibly" be misplaced. The Junker- Street position would clearly be that such emphasis is surely misplaced. In sum, on the issues raised by the narrowly construed savings-centered theory, institutionalists Heilbroner and possibly Gordon, plus Nichols (not an institutionalist) argue that real savings are probably a critical part of the capital accumulation-development process, whereas Junker, De Gregori, Street, and Robinson (an institutionalist?) take the opposing view. More broadly construed, institutionalism does not assign primary im- portance to savings as an essential incentive to more rapid growth. (Non- institutionalists, probably for somewhat different reasons, might agree.) Institutionalists generally stress the primary importance of institutional flexibility and adaptability to a dynamic changing technology as a major, if not the major, prerequisite to economic growth and development. On the narrower question of the role of savings there is confusion. All writers in the JEI do not take the same position, and in the process of discus- sion the most ardent opponents of savings-centered capital accumulation theory align themselves with similarly minded economists who are not customarily viewed as institutionalists. Gordon, finally, regards "the con- ventional Keynesian position" as disposing of the matter. One must con- clude that a narrowly construed savings-centered theory per se is at best a tenuous reed on which to hang a possible distinction between institu- tional development economists and other development economists. Con- cerning the general necessity of permitting technological developments to</page><page sequence="15">Development Economics 799 emerge in order for economic development to occur, virtually all develop- ment economists appear to be in agreement. Institutionalism and Current Development Economics In a recent discussion entitled "Development Economics from a Chi- cago Perspective"-a perspective which, in most any other field of eco- nomics, should differentiate evolutionary from mainstream economics in about as clear-cut a fashion as can be imagined-W. Paul Strassmann comments: "Compared with the mainstream and Marxist approaches to economic development in the past quarter of a century, the Chicago anti- interventionists do not come off badly."'51 That a distinguishing character- istic of the Chicago School is a preference for relying on the market will surprise no one. What is not so immediately unsurprising, however, is that Strassmann, both an institutionalist and a development economist, here includes no "institutionalist approach to development economics"-only mainstream, Marxist, and Chicago. I suggest this is because, as previously noted, in development economics in general the mainstream is institu- tionalist. It is true that he notes that Gunnar Myrdal (an institutionalist) is "infuriating" to Chicago when he writes that "the price system as a part of a very irrational whole, namely the economy of a backward and stag- nating country, can hardly have any great claim on rationality to begin with."52 The point to note is that the comment of institutionalist Myrdal might be infuriating to Chicago, but hardly to the mainstream of develop- ment economists. Strassmann offers a long quotation from Chicago's Arnold Harberger: While simple theoretical models have been developed in which the bottle- neck to progress turns out to be, depending on the circumstances, either a shortage of domestic resources (a "savings gap") or a shortage of im- ported goods (a "foreign exchange gap") there are at most only a few countries and periods to which such models can be applied in practice. In general, as is well-known the modernization of backward economies is a time-consuming process. Barriers to growth abound: social and political elites unreceptive to change, gross deficiencies of the technical skills and capacities required by modernization, markets that are poorly organized and whose functioning is further impaired by ill-conceived public poli- cies, systems of fiscal and also foreign-trade policy that in their present state are if anything impediments to rather than promoters of moderniza- tion-these constitute only a partial listing.53 Strassmann's eminently appropriate comment is: "What institutional</page><page sequence="16">800 Philip A. Klein economist could quarrel with that list?"54 And here we come to the point precisely. Even Chicago economists in the development field are not "Chi- cago economists" specializing in development but are mainstream devel- opment economists. What we have been suggesting is that in this field "mainstream economists" are institutionalist economists. The contro- versies one finds in development economics are those which, in general, begin beyond the basic premises which, although they clearly separate mainstream from institutional economists in most of our discipline, are pretty clearly agreed to in general by most development economists. In terms, therefore, of Coats's notion that one might find clues to basic orien- tation in development economics by comparing relevant work published in the Journal of Economics Issues with that published in Economic De- velopment and Cultural Change, one can reasonably conclude that the differences between them are far smaller than'the differences, say, between both of them and Chicago's Journal of Political Economy. In this sense, therefore, development economics can with considerable accuracy be called "the least orthodox field in economics."55 Contemporary Institutionalism, Development Economics, and Beyond Economic development is, in the final analysis, a process. Despite the misleading nature of much of the terminology, few if any economies have never changed or developed at all. "Underdeveloped" and "backward" are, therefore, not the absolutes they seem to suggest, but are relative terms, as the more recent and appropriate term, "developing," clearly is. At the other extreme, we speak of Western Europe, the United States, and Japan as "developed," and this, too, is misleading-they are merely more developed. This emphasis on process has always been a major characteris- tic of evolutionary economics. Institutionalists have historically expended most of their energies in trying to pursuade economists to look at our own economy from an evolutionary or processual perspective. It has not been an easy struggle. This survey has attempted to show that because change and development-process-is the very fundamental premise from which development economics must begin, almost all economists, regardless of what they call themselves when they are not being "development econo- mists"-whether Chicagoans, mainstream economists, Keynesians, what- ever-have been drawn ineluctably to operate from within far more of the framework of evolutionary economics than many (both institutionalists and others) realize. Ayres always maintained that the changing interface between the dynamic technology and the resistant institutional fabric was</page><page sequence="17">Development Economics 801 far easier to see in other cultures than in one's own. Nowhere is this truth more strikingly borne out than in the contrast between the relative ease with which development economists can adopt an evolutionary perspec- tive and the relative difficulty most economists (including, one supposes, a number of these same development economists) have in accepting this perspective for the study of their own economies. Recently, mainstream economists have been forced increasingly to ac- cept an evolutionary perspective as they contemplate the consequences of economic growth in their own economies. This is a position a number of economists have recently argued, including Ezra Mishan, myself, and others.56 In effect, the essential dynamic underlying the economy as a de- veloping entity, with all that this entails and on which evolutionary econo- mists have insisted for decades, is now pretty clearly accepted by the mainstream, both when looking at economies in relatively early stages of development and, increasingly, when looking at postindustrial develop- ment. It is only in the "middle," when considering mostly static economics for their own advanced industrialized economies, that the disagreement between evolutionary and mainstream economists continues. The accep- tance, therefore, of evolutionary principles is perhaps far more complete than many of us have realized. Conclusions Several main propositions about the current state of development eco- nomics and its relationship to evolutionary economics emerge from the work of development economists who are avowedly institutionalists or who may classify themselves otherwise. Development economics is the subdiscipline in which institutionalism has thus far had its greatest influence. It is the "least orthodox" field in economics; hence, it is argued, it is the most heterodox, which is to say institutionalist. If mainstream development economics is basically institutionalist, it is because evolutionary or institutional economics and development eco- nomics must begin with change as the basic premise and with explicit dis- avowal of the conventional givens of mainstream economics-tastes, resources, population, technology, a closed economy, rationality, and em- phasis on the interaction of these givens in one mechanism, the market. In precisely the same way that institutionalists have always examined the interaction of these factors partly as determining and partly emerging from the economy, so, too, this is the only sensible perspective from which to view economies less developed than our own.</page><page sequence="18">802 Philip A. Klein Thorstein Veblen emphasized process as the motive force in the econ- omy and ineluctably, therefore, in the science which studies the economy. In his view economics has always been an evolutionary science. Ayres, commenting on Veblen's work, wrote: "Workmanship implies not only working with the hands but with tools, and tools are always capable of combination and elaboration. Growth, development, evolution-all are implicit in that type of activity."57 And "that type of activity" is precisely what all economies organize. Hence, "growth, development, and evolu- tion" are characteristics of all economies-not just those of the Third World. This unity of process is in constant need of emphasis by evolutionary economics. The process is nonteleological, and "backward" countries are merely at an earlier point on the continuum than "developed" countries. No nations, as we are all finally aware, are "developed" in the sense of having reached any "end." The word industrialization in connection with economic development is, therefore, used ambiguously. It may appropriately be employed to de- note a critical part of the tool developing process, but it is often used inappropriately to suggest some finite technological state, as in "under- developed countries must strive to achieve industrialization." All econo- mies constantly cope with the ongoing adjustments which technological change presents to them. At the heart of economic development, in consequence, lies the process of technological change. The wheel and the missile are on the same tech- nological continuum. The "most primitive" and "most advanced" econo- mies are on the same development path. This explains why, in the end, the distinction between "development economics," used to refer to the problems of converting agricultural into industrial economies, and "growth economics," used to consider the range of problems faced by highly indus- trialized economies as they contemplate their futures, is ultimately a phony distinction. None of this is really new. Schumpeter's "perennial gale of creative destruction" as inventions press institutional constraints to be- come "innovations" suggests the primary institutionalist notion about how dynamic technological possibilities are adapted via institutional adjust- ment into societally diverse patterns of change. The challenge to institutionalists or evolutionary economists is to make the economics profession ever more aware of precisely how institutional- ist "mainstream" economics has become. The distinction, indeed, can today be clearly maintained only for a shrinking area of static economics dealing (increasingly unrealistically) with the here and now in the highly industrialized economies of the world. For those which lie in the East, our</page><page sequence="19">Development Economics 803 "establishment economics" must contend with the conflicting jurisdic- tional claims of Marxists and central planners of various stripes. In the capitalist or at least market-oriented economies of the West, "establish- ment economists," as we have endeavored here to show, are already largely institutionalist when they contemplate economic process outside their own countries in less developed economies. Only in relatively more developed industrialized economies are the conventional assumptions as- sociated with mainstream micro- and macroeconomics, and against which institutionalists have been railing for many decades, still being seriously propounded. Finally, as concern with the future of postindustrial society increases, problems involving pollution, conservation, the quality of life, the energy crisis, and our newfound interest in the possibly dubious virtues of what we have previously called "growth" all suggest overwhelmingly that at the more "advanced" end of the spectrum precisely the same funda- mental questions must be faced as development economists have over- whelmingly accepted as essential for the analysis of economies at the less advanced end. Ultimately, the institutionalist perspective emerges as con- sistently appropriate for evaluating, as well as directing, "the economy" as it moves along the entire spectrum from less to ever more developed.

Because of the distinction made between growth and development in the text, it should be clear that we are distinguishing</page><page sequence="20">804 Philip A. Klein growth theory in the sense used by modern adaptors of classical Ricardo- Marx growth models from development theory. This latter is the theory of how preindustrial economies increase their per capita outputs by in- dustrializing in some fashion appropriate to each economy's particular institutional characteristics and cope with the attendant problems such economic transformation invariably brings. The former type of growth theory does not necessarily presuppose any institutional changes but con- centrates instead on the implications for productivity and increased out- put per capita of varying the input proportions, frequently spelling out these implications in highly mathematical models.

Christian begins by considering the views of a whole list of development economists who have concerned themselves with the relationship between technological change and economic growth (Robert Solow, Edward F. Denison, William Fellner, Eli Ginzberg, Ed- win Mansfield) and argues that equal attention should be paid to institu- tional changes required for growth. However, from this "evolutionary" perspective, Christian pursues conventional techniques, beginning with a Harrod-type model, to develop a "dynamic general equilibrium model." He emerged with three variables-work-leisure preference patterns, labor force participation rates, and population as affecting the full employment growth rate. The terminology and approach are anything but institutional- ist, but the essential thrust is an effort to contribute to a problem that Clarence Ayres regarded as critical in economic development. 38.

Watts, 1962), p. 105, quoted in Junker, "Capital Accumulation," p. 25. In short, Robinson, perhaps a "radical economist" now, but not customarily viewed as an institutionalist, agrees with the Junker position. She says of the basic Har- rodian equation G = SI V that it has "made a great negative contribution to the development of economics" by making it appear that a primary determinant of growth is the savings rate (ibid., p. 105). 41. Robinson, Economic Philosophy, pp. 109-10, quoted in Junker, "Capital Accumulation," pp. 25-26. 42. Junker, "Capital Accumulation," pp. 26-27. Junker argues that Heil- broner, a former board member of AFEE, reflects the "almost universal position when he writes, 'It is for the lack of capital of every sort, not just for lack of capital on the land, that the underdeveloped nations are un- able to produce adequate incomes' " (quoted in ibid., p. 27, from Heil- broner's The Great Ascent). The argument of the text is simply that what- ever the merits of the debate this puts institutionalist Heilbroner in direct opposition to institutionalists Junker, Street, and De Gregori (see text below) and so makes the narrow question of the role of savings in capital accumulation and ultimate economic development a very treacherous way to try and differentiate institutionalist from standard development eco- nomics. 43.

De Gregori, "Prodigality or Parsimony," p. 261. De Gregori is probably correct as well that development economists, in ridding themselves of the vestiges of savings-centered theory, can do so with benefit to development economics by recognizing clearly that "every time phenomena fall out- side traditional categories, orthodox economists do not rethink the issues, they merely rename them. We are left with the whole of economic devel- opment.... We are left at the point where every evolutionary economist begins: an evolutionary theory of value, a cumulative theory of tech- nology, an interdisciplinary analysis of social institutions with special emphasis on their resistance to change, and a theory of growth and dis- semination of knowledge and skills. We do have theory that conforms to reality." Ibid., pp. 263-64. The only point in contention, as previously discussed, is, on the one hand, the comment that all the institutionalist development economists have clearly not yet "rid themselves of the vestiges of savings-centered theory" to the degree De Gregori asserts (see the previous section of the text) is appropriate. On the other hand, the degree to which the majority of development economists, however they label themselves otherwise, have accepted the central thrust of these basic propositions of evolution- ary economics may be larger than De Gregori and some other institu- tionalists have realized. 56.
