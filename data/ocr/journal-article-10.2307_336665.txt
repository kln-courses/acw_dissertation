<plain_text><page sequence="1">LORCA'S "BURLA DE DON PEDRO A CABALLO" DomRs MARGARET GLASSER Oregon State University The second of the three romances his- t6ricos which conclude the Romancero gitano combines historicity and artistry. Esta noche le mataron, al caballero, la gala de Medina, la Hr de Olmedo. This refrain from an old Spanish popular song may be the source of Lorca's "Burla de Don Pedro a caballo";1 it must have haunted those who heard it, just as the strange estribillo of his romance has haunted many readers. The treacherous murder of the young knight of Olmedo is a part of Spanish history; it has been the inspiration for popular ballads and for several poetic and dramatic works of known authorship. The theme was es- pecially popular during the period of Lope de Vega; he was the most successful of the authors who treated it, first in serious and later in comic form. Of the known versions that have been traced, Lorca's appears to be the first in which the story of the murder has been treated as a burla, intended perhaps as an ironic comment on man's fate. In his romance, certain elements of which resemble Lope's de- scription of the murder in El caballero de Olmedo, Lorca uses the historical event only as a point of departure and recreates the legend within the frame of his own poetic system. The world of external reality is transformed into a phantasmagoric universe in which the reader as well as the knight is submerged "bajo el agua." This is accomplished in apparently simple language that is richly evocative, and through multi-sensory imagery and com- plex metaphors. The fusion of fantasy and reality is so complete that the narrative becomes imprecise; the murder is related in a series of dream-like scenes set in an atmosphere of moonlight, shadow, and deep water. Lorca evokes much of the action through metaphors; he creates the setting by treating the lagunas in which the tragedy is consummated as separate divisions of the poem, markedly different from the main narrative in style and meter. The general tone of the poem is strangely ironic: the heroic knight undergoes a com- plete loss of dignity, and his death, treated as insignificant, results in almost immediate oblivion. This romance seems to be the least discussed of the Romancero gitano, but it merits comment. The element of mockery is relatively rare in Lorca and certainly not the domi- nant note of the Romancero gitano, in which the oppressed gypsy is elevated to the dignity of the "gitano legitimo." Why then should a legendary figure be treated as less important than his horse, and the account of his death be called a "comical history"? Some explanation for this may be found in the tradition of the romances of Don Bueso, of which the name Don Pedro is the modernized form.2 Men6ndez Pidal has traced the figure from a thir- teenth century epic, in which he appears as a French knight defeated and killed by Bernardo del Carpio, to a sixteenth century romance of which he is the hero. By the late sixteenth century, however, Don Bueso appears as a comic rather than a heroic figure; "era famoso tipo de parodia entre los literatos."3 One such romance, dating from 1588, appears in the notes to the MacDonald edition of Lope's El caba- llero de Olmedo and is connected with the text.4 These comic versions are men- tioned not to establish a thematic relation- ship to Lorca's poem but to show the tradi- 295</page><page sequence="2">296 HISPANIA tion of parody and caricature associated with the name of his protagonist. The heroic Caballero de Olmedo who appears in Lope de Vega's tragicomedy and in other plays and poems of the seven- teenth century5 had a historical basis in the story of Don Juan de Vivero. While returning from a bullfight at Medina, the young man was taken by surprise and killed treacherously by Don Miguel Ruiz de la Fuente, whose mother had insisted that he avenge an insult incurred in a quarrel with Don Juan over some grey- hounds.6 In his dramatic adaptation, Lope changed the name of the knight to Don Alonso, made jealousy and romantic rival- ry the motives for the crime, and involved more than one man in the murder. Lope provided an eyewitness in the person of Tello, whose report of the murder to the king parallels in several respects the se- quence of events that can be pieced to- gether from Lorca's poetic account. Lorca's protagonist is not described, but his spirited horse and Don Pedro's desire for love suggest a young man, sensitive enough to cry, either from disillusionment, defeat, or possibly a premonition of his tragic fate. Lope's Don Alonso is also melancholy, al- though he does not cry. He has reason to be disturbed; even though he has just saved his rival's life, he is aware that the latter's jealousy may incite him to murder. The three premonitions of death that ap- pear to Don Alonso before the crime add a supernatural element: the warning dream (II, 1754-87), whose symbolism recalls that of the traditional "Romance de dofia Alda," the appearance of his own ghost (III, 2254-72), and the song of the labrador, the same popular song that was sung about the original Caballero de Olmedo after his death: Que de noche le mataron al caballero, la gala de Medina, la Hor de Olmedo. (III, 2371-74) Just before Don Alonso meets the labra- dor, his melancholy is increased by the sound of water: Del agua el manso ruido, y el ligero movimiento destas ramas con el viento, mi tristeza aumentan mi4s. (III, 2345-49) The same labrador urges Don Alonso to turn back: "Volved atrds; no pas6is / deste arroyo." (III, 2406-07) Here water be- comes a barrier between safety and death; in Lorca's romance, it becomes the agent of death. Alonso twice speaks of his death in figurative terms, which readers familiar with the historical legend can take literally. Thus there is dramatic irony in Alonso's instructions to Tello just before he goes to meet Inds: "si esta noche no fuese / a Olmedo, me han de contar / mis padres por muerto," (III, 1903-05), and in his farewell to In6s: Parto a morir, y te escribo mi muerte, si ausente vivo, porque tengo, In s, por cierto que si vuelvo, seri muerto, pues partir no puedo vivo. (III, 2210-14) It is in Tello's account of the murder (III, 2662-2710) that we find the greatest number of similarities with Lorca's ro- mance.7 The time in Lope's play is "la destocada noche"; in Lorca's romance it is evidently also night. The location of the crime for Lope is "al pasar un arroyuelo"; in Lorca the three lagunas dominate the scene. The role of the moon is greater in the poem; Lope has it serve the practical purpose of revealing the criminals to Tello, whereas Lorca uses it as a symbol of death. His "luna redonda" casts a spell over the scene, and may attract Don Pedro to the water. The participants in the action are more clearly designated by Lope than by Lorca. Tello is present as a witness; he sees six men, presumably the murderers, running toward Medina. The witnesses to the crime in Lorca's ballad are not named. He mentions the presence of "testigos que conocen lo que falta," which need not be human; they may be the poplars and the</page><page sequence="3">GARCIA LORCA 297 nightingale, or other people not mentioned earlier in the poem. The "dos mujeres y un viejo" find the dead horse that gives evidence of a crime, but do not appear to have witnessed it. In both literary treat- ments the crime is of a violent nature. Tello finds Don Alonso "envuelto en su sangre." Lorca's image "Sobre el peinado del agua / un circulo de pdjaros y llamas," suggests, through color association, blood on the water. Tello cannot "hacer resis- tencia al llanto" when describing the mur- der he has witnessed. In Lorca's romance "un hombre va llorando / tierras adentro." This man is not identified; he might be a witness, or another image of Don Pedro, now dead. Lope has an interval between the attack and Don Alonso's death, since the knight arrives at Olmedo still alive. It is difficult to establish the time of Don Pedro's death. He is presumably still alive when the poplars and the nightingale place bets on his fate. There seems to be a time lapse after the second laguna; it may be the following afternoon when the horse is found. It is the literary fate of the two protagonists that differs most radically. Don Alonso becomes a legendary figure, living on "en las lenguas de la fama"; how- ever, "esti Don Pedro olvidado." As might be expected, Lope, writing in dramatic form, uses more direct expression, while Lorca uses more suggestion and imagery. Lope's moonlight has a practical result; Lorca's creates a mysterious atmos- phere. The two versions of the murder have a number of common elements: the dark night, the water and moonlight, the bloody death, and the presence of old peo- ple, witnesses, and at least one mourner, although this is not definite in the ro- mance. The fates of the two protagonists differ significantly; it is this that makes the earlier version a tragicomedy and the poem a burla. Lope glorifies the victim's memory and suggests that he will live on in the "vida de fama" accorded to great men; Lorca places him on a level with the frogs, devoid of dignity and already forgotten. This ironic treatment of the dead knight seems to be original with Lorca. Of the three romances hist6ricos that conclude the Romancero gitano, this is the only one that concerns Spanish history and is related to a popular origin rather than a literary tradition. In his version, the poet has retained some of the formal characteristics of the ballad. Like the tradi- tional romances, Lorca's ballads present a climactic episode in concise form, and convey emotional intensity with linguistic simplicity. The particular artistry of Lor- ca's romances lies in his original metaphors and in the addition of the subconscious to the ballad. The form of "Burla de Don Pedro a caballo" is not consistently in ballad meter: the main narrative has a predominance of seven-syllable lines, but the line length varies from four to eight syllables. It is the lagunas that are most irregular, ranging from three to eleven syllables per line. The subtitle "romance con lagunas" and the change of meter of the lagunas sets them apart extrinsically; these three sections have other functions in relation to the poem as a whole. They interrupt the factual narration but are re- lated to it and continue it through imagery. They add the physical presence of water. They also establish much of the dream-like atmosphere in which the hero is sub- merged and the scene dominated by mys- terious "fuerzas oscuras."8 In the lagunas, reality is seen in and through water, thus distorted. It ceases to be static or organized; it acquires a plasticity of line and color that all but destroys formal logic. L6pez- Morillas has observed that Lorca lacks pre- conceived notions of form. He structures reality as a child would, impressionistically and spontaneously.9 An example of the child's view of the external world occurs in the first laguna, which gives a double view of reality literally, through the reflec- tion, and figuratively, in the image. The lagunas may be said to add a second level</page><page sequence="4">298 HISPAiA of reality, to stress the role of water in the episode, and to reiterate the theme through the estribillo "Bajo el agua/siguen las pala- bras." The change from "siguen" to "estin" in the last one establishes the finality of Don Pedro's death. Other poetic elements contribute to the dream-like setting. In Lorca's poetry, color is often more evocative than descriptive. In "Burla de Don Pedro a caballo" it is not merely a quality of the objects them- selves, but forms part of the atmosphere and relates to the symbolism of the poem. The spectrum is limited, with three colors predominating: black, white, and red. The sharp contrast of black and white re-echoes the visualization of moonlight on the water, stressing once more the presence of death: symbolically, in the moon, and also by the association of black with death and mourning. Horse, water, and poplars are black, in a night whose darkness is counter- acted by moonlight and silver lamps. The black horse is juxtaposed to the white uni- corn. The flames on the water and those of the burning city introduce red, the color of blood, to the scene. All three colors are related to death. We recall that later, in his "Llanto por Ignacio Sinchez Me- jias," Lorca elaborated on the symbol of the spilled blood as the essence of death, and invoked a succession of white objects in an attempt to obliterate the redness that so obsessed him. In the "Burla de Don Pedro," the ring of flames on the crest of the water may be interpreted as a gon- goristic image of Don Pedro's spilled blood. The ripples suggest that he has fallen-or been thrown-into the water. Senses other than the visual are involved in this romance. It is infused with the fragrance of lemon verbena and rosemary, cedars and saffron. Music is evoked by the cymbals and guitar used in two of the images. Lorca was sensitive to the auditory quality of language; its effect in his poetry has more than once been called magical. Through it, he transforms elements of everyday reality into objects of poetic beauty. In his essay "La imAgen po6tica en Don Luis de G6ngora," Lorca discusses the importance he attached to synesthesia in poetry;'1 he applied this technique often in his imagery. Lorca's statement on the function of a metaphor is found in the same essay: "La metifora une dos mundos antag6nicos por medio de un salto ecuestre que da la ima- ginaci6n."11 It is largely through metaphor that the fusion of planes of reality men- tioned earlier is accomplished. This may involve the interchanging of unlike things, related by the essence of their being and ignoring differences of size and importance, form and color.12 Concha Zardoya has classified the types of metaphor that appear in Lorca; examples of many of her classi- fications occur in this poem.'3 Some of these images defy an attempt at logical explanation, but excite the imagination. As L6pez-Morillas remarked: si ahondamos un poco echaremos de ver que la imagen concreta . . . se borra a medida que se va enfocando nuestra curiosidad y, pareja- mente, ensancha su significado original, trocn- dolo en una nebulosa de imprecisas sugerencias y vagas alusiones.14 The most essential images remain few: the moon, the water, blood, and death. The moon appears as an omen of death elsewhere in the Romancero gitano; in this poem it appears as two full moons, thus foreshadowing the deaths of both man and animal. The fact that it is full ac- counts for its extraordinary power over Don Pedro: his fate recalls that of the gypsy girl in "Romance sonaimbulo." Co- rrea believes that the personified moon is the causal factor in the knight's death: El caballero enamorado que va en busca de su amada a quien no encuentra, recibe en el camino la atracci6n de la figura antropom6rfica de la luna reflejada en tres lagunas. La atracci6n progresiva en las dos primeras metiforas lo levan a confundirse con la tercera laguna que sirve de tumba a don Pedro.15 This suggests that the death of Don Pedro was due to an irresistible attraction, which</page><page sequence="5">GARCiA LORCA 299 compelled him to enter the water in an effort to identify himself with the moon by immersing himself in its reflection. The anthropomorphic moon would thus be casting a spell over him, as it did over the gypsy child in "Romance de la luna, luna." This interpretation would give the lagunas an additional function, that of augmenting the power of the moon until it over- whelmed Don Pedro and led him to his death. Correa also insists on the existence of three separate bodies of water, with the death occuring in the third. I find such an interpretation difficult to substantiate from the text of the poem and the labeling of its divisions. The moon in the first laguna appears to the child not as a malevolent force but as a plaything. As a full moon, it would have an evil influence in terms of Lorca's moon imagery, but at this point of the poem, the death has not yet occurred. The signifi- cant part of this image is not the moon itself, but its reflection; it is the water, here the reflecting agent and later Don Pedro's final resting place, that gains in importance as the poem progresses. The moon is not named again, only suggested by the shining roofs and clouds in the second stanza and completely absent from the third. However, the moon's presence must be inferred as long as it is night. If we assume a time lapse after the second la- guna, to allow for the discovery of the dead horse, it is no longer night in the third stanza, and the moon's absence is justified. With this assumption, moreover, there can be no more than two lagoons, since Don Pedro's death must have occurred at night, and it is by now, as suggested by the "Voz secreta de tarde," the following afternoon. The last section of the poem is labeled "iiltima laguna" rather than third; the adjective chosen may have a temporal significance rather than designating a separate body of water. This section shifts the focus from the surface of the water, where the moon would be reflected, to its depths. Don Pedro's death has already taken place; it does not occur at this point of the poem. Therefore it seems that the second and last lagoons are one and the same, and that while Don Pedro may have become a part of the moon symbolically by dying, there could not have been a direct causal relationship between the moon and his death. The attitude toward the knight and toward death in this poem is what seems to constitute the burla. We may not agree as to whether Don Pedro was murdered, in keeping with the historical tradition, or over-powered by cosmic forces, but he is unquestionably dead. And yet, in the final description, there is a continuation of move- ment. He is not at rest but "jugando con las ranas," in an image which makes death seem like a game, and which again suggests a child-like view of reality, as did the moon image in the first laguna. No spiritual significance is attached to his fate. There is a suggestion of physical deterioration in his being under the water, whose bottom is a "limo de voces perdidas," but this aspect is not stressed. Speech has ceased and the warmth of the body has departed, but the visualization of the dead man is not static. The tragedy is turned to irony as death loses its sense and Don Pedro is placed on a level with the frogs. Even his horse has more physical presence in the poem; the animal may be visualized from the description in the opening lines, but the rider may not; the focus is on his emotional state and purpose rather than his appearance. Don Pedro has a name, but he remains essentially anonymous in this poem. We learn his fate but not how it was brought about. The dead horse, whose color relates to the poem's theme and symbolism, becomes the only con- crete evidence of the crime. The poet does not express any response to the catastrophe but remains impersonal. The humble gypsy of "La casada infiel" has infinitely</page><page sequence="6">300 HISPANIA more dignity than this dehumanized man whose historical prototype was once con- sidered a hero. Such a complete loss of dignity is rare in Spanish literature. Man, by extension, becomes insignificant in the cosmos; his death is meaningless and senseless. The conflict between man's dignity and a hostile universe is only one of several levels of tension. There is the conflict be- tween illusion and reality, a reality com- prised of recognizable concrete objects, whose whole is not the sum of its parts. The contrastive meters of the romance and lagunas, and the linguistic simplicity en- dowed with evocative power through juxta- position and complex imagery constitute a third level, of form and meaning. Finally, there is a psychological tension in Don Pedro's frustration of purpose and in his seeking of bread and kisses, goals which may represent realism and idealism, the everyday needs and the aspiration toward less tangible values. This romance has revitalized a historical legend in an original manner that con- tinues the ballad tradition on a high level of artistry. As part of what is generally considered Lorca's most important and characteristic volume of poetry, this strange and haunting "romance con lagunas" de- serves closer scrutiny than it has hitherto been given.

The inanimate becomes humanized: "las ventanas / preguntan al viento, / por el lanto oscuro / del caballero." "Voz sec- reta de tarde / balaba por el cielo." 2. The static becomes dynamic: "una luna redonda / se bafia." 3. Personification: "Los chopos dicen: No. / Y el ruisefior: Veremos." 4. Synesthesia: "el Ilanto oscuro" (audi- tory-visual); "la flor enfriada" (visual- tactile). 5. An element of nature becomes a con- crete, inanimate object: "un nifio / ve las lunas y dice: / -iNoche; toca los platillos!" Since this also involves personification, it constitutes a polyvalent metaphor, in keep- ing with Zardoya's explanation of the term. (310-314). 6. Sensations are transposed: "unicornio de ausencia." 7.
