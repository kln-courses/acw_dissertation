New York, Macmillan Co. xii + 244 pp. Vignettes drawn by Elizabeth Dasmann, also 32 photos and 12 maps. $6.95.-This book gives the reader a dreary and un- fortunately factual picture of the exploitation and destruction of land, air, water, flora, and fauna in Florida. It is no different than similar destruction that has taken place all over our country, but it seems more dramatic because Florida con- tained the only subtropical wilderness regions in the continental United States.

This book was not written for ornithologists but is excellent background material for anyone working in zoology, even though the bird material has many petty errors. Dr. Dasmann should have consulted reports in literature or ornithologists who knew Cattle Egrets in British Guiana in the 1930s before announcing that they arrived in 1940 and that nobody knows how they traveled. Also, he should not speak of "English sparrow and the common starling" as immigrants-if he wants to be anthropomorphic he should at least call them transportees. Tree Swallows in masses swooping down on the low bushes of Sanibel Island during a cold snap were indeed "natural" but hardly a "fantastic . . . phe- nomena." They were just hungry and feeding on myrtle berries. This book should be required reading for all politicians and all so-called developers, if it is possible that either of the above two subspecies of Homo sapiens know how to read.- ELIZABETH S.
