<plain_text><page sequence="1">GANDHARA AND EARLY CHRISTIAN ART: BUDDHA PALLIATUS THE resemblance of certain Gandhara statues of the Buddha, such as those exca- vated at Hadda in Afghanistan, (fig. 1.) to early representations of Christ has long been noticed (fig. 2), as has the fact that both types apparently spring from the Greek orator type as exemplified by the Sophocles of the Lateran.' In these Buddha figures the garment worn is unmistakably a himation and not the regular safighdti: even though the undergarment visible in some of these statues suggests the tunic worn under the Roman toga, this mantle should, as will be explained directly, be described as a himation or pallium from the association of this dress with the ancient philosophers.2 The various personages in antique sculpture with the right hand emerging from the himation or pallium illustrate a style of wearing the garment that prevailed in every quarter of the Late Antique world: it is paralleled at once in the Buddhas of Gandhara, in Roman portrait statues, portrayals of Christ, and in the countless grave reliefs of Palmyra., The fact that the pallium, draped in such a way that the right arm was supported as though muffled in a sling, con- tinued to be worn until at least the fourth century is illustrated in many portrait statues, notably the effigy of Julian the Apostate in the Louvre.4 It was not a pre- vailing fashion of dress, however, but the association of this costume with ancient representations of philosophers and teachers that led to its adaptation to the early images of Christ and Buddha.5 However, the resemblance between the first statues of Christ and Buddha is not at all surprising if we consider that both are the result 1 H. Graeven, "Ein Christustypus in Buddhafiguren," Oriens Christianus 1901, pp. 159-167; L. Brehier, L'art chretien, Paris, 19928, p. 50, etc. The German scholar of liturgical vestments, Father Braun, describing a typical Gandhara Buddha, has written: "Es sind merkwiirdige Darstellungen, die nicht selten wie ein getreues Bild eines christlichen Priesters aus altchristlicher Zeit in seiner litur- gischen Gewandung aussehen." J. Braun, Die Liturgische Gewandung, Freiburg, 1907, p. 243. The word pallium used here is not to be confused with the Christian vestment, the pallium or palla, with which, so far as the writer has been able to discover, it has no connection. The classical word pallium in classical Latin meant any kind of a covering, garment, or a mantle; it was, too, the equivalent of the Greek himation which differed from the Roman toga in being a rectangular piece of cloth and not rounded or semicircular like the toga. The himation or pallium, which we may conclude from what follows, is the garment worn by the Sophocles of the Lateran and the Aeschinus of the Naples Museum, was, as Tertullian tells us, particularly reserved for philosophers, orators, poets, etc. (J. Wilpert, "Neue Monumente zur Symbolik des heiligen Palliums," R6mische Quartalschrift ii/iii, 1926, p. 96); Pliny (NH. xxxv, 40), implies that "palliatus" was a regular synonym for philosopher. Although at first held in contempt by the Romans, this garment later replaced the toga in popularity. The pallium-himation was international in popularity in contrast with the national character of the Roman toga. Worthy of note with regard to Christ's dress is Wilpert's statement (I sarcofagi cristiani antichi ii, Rome, 19392, p. 6): "Mai il Signore porta la toga, come qualcuno ha supposto." SL. M.

Augustine again draws a parallel between Christ, the Master of the new doctrine and the ancient philosophers: paucis mutatis verbis, he says, in speaking of Plato, atque sententiis Christiani fierent.7 Christ the Paedagogue is here again thought of as replacing the teachers of the ancients.8 Concepts of this sort made it natural to represent the great teacher of Christianity in the iconography of the "teacher-orator" of the classic world. It seems almost redundant to point out that, in a similar way, Buddha was regarded as the great teacher, the denier of the ancient order as represented by the Vedas: the Graeco-Roman workmen who fashioned his images in Gandhara, like their Early Christian cousins, chose the classic orator type as the most suitable for portraying the Teacher, the "Logos" of the Eastern world.1o Father Braun states that the philosopher's gown was worn by holy men in the Roman Christian world of the second and third centuries and that it was regarded as a garb of honor." As Brehier has demonstrated, there was nothing unusual in the selection of the pagan orator type for the representation of our Lord, who was Himself the supreme teacher, the eternal "Paedagogue." 12 It is eminently worthy of note that, in both the Buddha and Christ image, a youthful ephebe type is substituted for the mature bearded faces of the orators. It has been suggested that the Early Christian representations of Christ as a young man with long hair are taken over from earlier Apollonian prototypes." Our Lord's Resurrection is the sun's rising; His descent into Hell the setting of the orb beyond the Western rim.14 The analogy to the daily and eternal course of Helios-Apollo is I F. Saxl, "Frlihes Christentum und spites Heidentum in ihren kunstl. Ausdrucksformen," Wiener Jahrbuch fiir Kunstgeschichte ii, 1992, p. 68. In the pre-Constantinian period Christ is the true philoso- pher who leads men back to the true Paradise lost by the sin of Adam. The earliest Christian symbol of this concept is the Good Shepherd; at the same time, Christus philosophicus is shown instructing his followers in the true doctrine. See F. Gerke, Christus in der Spditantiken Plastik, Berlin, 1940, p. 7. 8 On a sarcophagus from Monastirine, now in the museum at Salona, Christ, wearing the philoso- pher's gown and surrounded by a host of children, is portrayed as the divine Paedagogue. See O. Wulff, Altchristliche und Byzantinische Kunst i, Berlin, 1914, Abb. 167, pp. 173-174. 9 So also St. Justin preached the Word of God clad in the philosopher's gown. 10 "Buddha und Christus sind gleichermassen Antipoden des Heros klassischer Prigung. Judisch- hellenistischer und indisch-hellenistischer Spiritualismus haben die Welt erobert." (F. Saxl, Mithras, Berlin, 1931, p. 107). It must be strongly emphasized that, at about the same time or slightly earlier, the Buddha was being portrayed as a Yaksha in the studios of Mathura. The independent origin of these first truly Indian "portraits" of Sakyamuni is beyond question, since they have nothing to do with either the style or concept of the Gandhara Buddhas. 1' Braun, op. cit., pp. 65, 657. 12 Brehier, op. cit., p. 50. See also Clement of Alexandria, Paedagogus i; I am indebted for this last reference to my friend Alfonso Ossorio. See also W. Elliger, Zur Entstehung und friihen Entwicklung der altchristlichen Bildkunst, Leipzig, 1934, pp. 247 ff.; Gerke, op. cit., pp. 10, 12, 77. 13 For the stylistic aspect of this borrowing, see H. Dutschke, Ravennatische Studien, Leipzig, 1909, p. 117. The Apollonian Christ type, as seen in a sarcophagus in the Lateran (Gerke, op. cit., Abb. 53-55) seems to be a borrowing from the archaistic Apollo bronzes of the Naples Museum; generally, the Buddha heads are more closely related to the Apollo Belvedere, the krobylos forming a ready-made shape for the us.nisa. (See A. Foucher, L'art Grvco-Bouddhique du Gandhdra ii, Paris, 1918, pp. 296 ff., etc.). Although he refers to youthful representations of Christ as "Apollonian" in spirit (p. 42), Gerke never specifically suggests an Apollo type as a model. Presumably the deification of Christ, which took place in the fourth century and which we can see in the emergence of the Maiestas Domini concept, demanded a "supernaturally" beautiful representation of the Lord of the World. 14 W.

Beyond this there are many descriptions in the Gospels and the writings of the church fathers that, by the luciferous character attributed to Christ, must have suggested the pagan images of the Sun God as models for representing Him.t5 A similar choice of the classic Sun God as the type for the Buddha may naturally have suggested itself to the Eurasian artisans who carved the images of Gandhara from the frequent allusions to the Buddha's solar character in the sfitras.16 As far as we can say at the moment, Sakyamuni must have been represented in the guise of Sophocles and Aeschinus at the same time that Christ was given a similar anthropomorphic representation.'7 We may be justified in assuming that the iconographic type was introduced from the Roman Orient. Again, the stylistic parallels between this type in the East and West are as close as the spiritual simi- larities suggested by the literary sources mentioned above: the Buddha in our illustration has - as is only to be expected - the same sharp and linear caricature of the form-fitting robe of the Hellenistic orator type that we find in the well-known example from Psamatia (fig. 92) and in a sarcophagus from Clermont-Ferrand."8 As I have already stated in an earlier publication, the Buddhist sculpture of Gandhara is certainly derived from Roman Imperial art."9 Hugo Buchthal, in a re- cent article, reaches essentially the same conclusion, although we disagree on the exact date of the productions of the Northwest Indian centers of sculpture.20 We have already examined at length the probable iconographic reasons for the selection of the figure wearing a pallium for representations of Christ and Buddha. It seems just as likely that a Palmyrene grave relief with a figure clad in the himation could be the stylistic prototype for both the Christ figure and the Buddha image.21 FOGG MUSEUM OF ART BENJAMIN ROWLAND, JR. 15 I need mention only Our Lord's "glory," referred to so often in the Gospels (John i, 14, etc.) or that His face "did shine as the sun." (Matthew xvii, 2). St. Ambrose, indeed, addresses Christ directly as "Sol" Splendor paternae gloriae, de luce lucem proferens, Primordiis lucis novae diem dies illuminans. Verusque sol illabere, micans nitore perpeti, etc. (Hymnus Matulinus, No. vii). I may mention also St. Paul (i Ad Timoth., vi, 15-16): "Solus potens, rex regum et dominus dominantium, qui solus habet immortalitatem et lucem habitat inaccessibilem." 16 The following quotations will illustrate this point: "The Buddhas shine both by night and by day." (Dhammapada xxvi, 387, 5. E. W. Burlingame, "Buddhist Legends," Harvard Oriental Series 30, 1921, p. 278). "Like the Sun bursting from a cloud in the morning, . . . so he, too, when he was born from his mother's womb, made the world bright like gold; . . . dispelled the darkness." (Buddha-carita i, 26. Sacred Books of the East xlix, I). "He shone like the young sun descended upon the earth" (Ibid. i, 31). "He will shine forth as a sun of knowledge to destroy the darkness of illusion in the world." (Ibid., i, 74). 171 add as a final note on the Christ-Philosopher type the mention by the Gnostic Marcellina that in the Lararium in Alexandria there were set up and venerated "imagines Jesu et Pauli et Homeri et Pythagorae."
