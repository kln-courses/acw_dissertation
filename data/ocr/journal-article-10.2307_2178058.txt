Idealism, the doctrine that all that is known must be thought in relation to an ego, developed in connection with the problem of relativity; it originated in the perception that what had been taken as independent reality was really dependent upon the subject. In order to substantiate its claims one must show that there is no core of independent reality in the world we know, while to prove this one must show that the most 'objective' sciences attain their objectivity by selection from and transformation of experience, and that the fundamental concepts of these sciences are relative to a certain sort of ego, which, however, need be neither human nor individual. Knowledge strives toward a complete whole of all the known,-the Absolute; but this Absolute is never given, and is known only as relative to the Relative. To make this relation of Absolute and Relative clear we must examine the physical theory of relativity. The essential characteristic of modern theoretical physics is the effort to get rid of all reference to the human individual. It thus tends to posit an ideal physicist who is free from the limitations of in- dividuality. This same tendency expresses itself in the view that all spatial and temporal determinations are relative to each other. Our original ex- perience of spatial magnitudes, positions, directions, etc., seems an experience of absolutes; but this primitive absoluteness is set aside by the discovery of the relativity which makes spatial magnitudes, positions, directions, etc., seem dependent upon each other. But this discovery of relativity brings to light the fact that any arbitrary starting-point, any arbitrary standard of measurement, and any arbitrary choice of directions, is equally valid with any other; it implies the homogeneity of space. Results obtained on any basis can be translated into terms of results obtained on any other basis. That is, 567</page><page sequence="2">568 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. the space-order itself, in this process of making the terms relative, becomes absolute. The primitive absoluteness of our spatial experience is recognized in its relativity, and through this very recognition the relativity becomes harmless, and a new absoluteness is attained. The same holds of time. Position and length of time are made relative, and by that fact physics becomes independent of the time-characteristics of the physicist, e. g., when he lived and the tempo of his experience. The reduction to relative terms, however, is more difficult in the case of time than in that of space, for time, in its concrete form, is the form of our experience itself. Time can be made completely relative only for the ideal physicist, who timelessly intuits a timeless whole. Thus far the direction of time has remained an absolute for physics, and thus at this point physics still has a reference to the human individual. Motion, too, is to be made relative. Our knowledge of the motion of a system is relative to the motion of the system we take as our point of reference. But the recognition of this relativity makes our knowledge valid for observers taking any arbitrarily chosen system as a point of reference. This is expressed in the Galilei-Newtonian physics in the proposition: uniform motion in a straight line needs no force; that is, uniform motion in a straight line is as good as no motion as far as the internal processes of a system are concerned; the internal processes of any given system, in other words, are independent of the relations of the system to any other system. Just because all motion is relative and we can discover no absolute motion, the internal motions of any given system are unchanged by the point of view from which they are regarded; they possess absoluteness. In the very same way, space and time can be made relative in relation to each other. Certain processes, upon which motion has no influence, such as (apparently) the radiation of light, can only be expressed in terms of space and time: the point of reference has a space-time character. This relativity in terms of this four-dimensional space-time world, however, reveals a new absoluteness, for, when recognized, it sets us entirely free from the human individual. Thus Minkowski calls the postulate of relativity when carried to its furthest extreme, "the postulate of the absolute world." But in the four-dimensional absolute space-time world thus set up by Einstein and Minkowski there is still one reference to the human individual: time, unlike space, is recognized as having a direction. Ideally this should be eliminated, so that the relativity would be complete. The justification, however, for the elimination of concrete experience from this absolute world is itself relative to the ego, for it is an ideal of knowledge. Generalizing the relation of the absolute and the relative, we find that our primitive experience lays claim to an absoluteness which it loses in the process of becoming relative, while in our very recognition of its relativity it assumes a new absoluteness. Everything experienced claims recognition as a fact; this is the lower limit of relativity. The upper limit is the absolutely absolute, the ideal of knowledge, the whole. In every case, however, the absolute (absolute space, e. g.) is only significant in relation to the mutually related determinations; it merely means, e. g., that a given system can be expressed in terms of any arbitrarily</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 569 chosen system of coordinates. We may state the relations of absolute and relative in the paradoxical formula: "The absolute is only absolute in relation to the relative; the relative, in so far as it is determined in its relativity, is absolutely determined." The absolutely absolute is only cognizable as the goal of all knowledge. The lower limit of knowledge, pure blind experience, is seldom, if ever, realized. The upper goal of knowledge is the system of systems in which all true judgments are contained. But whose goal is it? Here we are referred again to the ego. But this relativity, when recognized, becomes a new absolute truth. Between the Absolute and the world of com- mon experience there are the special sciences, which use certain forms of knowledge, i. e., categories. The categories are general postulates whose precise form depends upon the aims of the special sciences in which they are employed. Thus causality assumes different forms in theoretical physics and in history. The working out of any one set of categories is not wholly an approach to the Absolute. The world of common experience, while it possesses its measure of truth, is yet essentially relative to the knowing ego. It is to be distinguished from the Absolute. It is like the Absolute in that it is in- clusive, while the special sciences, with their special categories, although they approach closer to the Absolute, do so along narrow lines by means of great eliminations. The ego, however, to which the world of common experience is correlative, can lay aside its particularity and seek to realize the ideal of knowledge it bears in itself. The world of common experience, however, is more than it seems; it is the appearance of the one unity of all possible ex- perience. The Absolute is independent of the ego because it is identical with the absolute ego. The individual in its individuality is unreal; it presupposes a whole. Hegel made this great discovery. W. CURTIS SWABEY. Das Prinzip der Ergdnzung in der Geschichtslogik. A. FOGARASI. Kant- Studien, XXI, 2-3, pp. 270-293. The work of Windelband and Rickert in the logic of history must be carried forward. They have distinguished history from natural science upon the basis of the fact that the former deals with individuals, the latter with universals, and have taught that the historical principle of selection is reference to cultural values. But they have not made clear the special logical forms involved in history. The facts selected by reference to cultural values must be organized, and for this purpose the cultural values will not suffice. The interpretation and exposition of historical facts cannot be accomplished solely upon the basis of universal values. For example, one may make purely logical comparisons (e. g., "Signs of Darwinism in Greek Philosophy") with reference to univer- sally valid values, but this is not history. History must be objectively founded. History of the former type (Sachgeschichte) has its value, however, when kept distinct from history of the latter type (Ereignisgeschichte). The new prin- ciple needed is the principle of completion (Ergdnzung). The individual fact is only historical when we have gone beyond it; it must be set in a context.</page><page sequence="4">570 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. This is not based upon the category of whole and part; the principle of com- pletion makes an essentially infinite demand. Both the principle of selection and the principle of completion may be reduced to a general principle of cor- relation. Historical research is said to consist of study of the sources, criti- cism, interpretation and exposition. The first two studies form one branch, the last two another. The principle of completion has a different meaning in each branch; in interpretation and exposition it means connecting facts with each other; in the study of the sources it means the search for new facts. In the former we start with the parts and build the whole; in the latter we start with the idea of the whole and look for the parts. While in the sphere of inter- pretation and exposition, selection and completion are correlative principles, in the sphere of the study of sources selection is less and completion more important, The principle of completion has two meanings: temporal completion and com- pletion of meaning. The former proceeds from the individual to the temporal context, epoch, generation, period, etc. The latter is illustrated in the field of source-study bythe reconstruction of the meaning of a text; in the field of inter- pretation, by the comprehension of a political system. The final temporal whole to which the individual belongs is the synthesis of past, present and future. On the side of meaning, the final whole to which the individual belongs is spirit. W. CURTIS SWABEY. La conception finalists de l'histoire. TH. RIBOT. Rev. Ph., XLII, 3, pp. 209- 2I8. This article is only a fragment which was left unfinished at the time of M. Ribot's death. Is it possible to discover a general law of history? M. Ribot examines five conceptions of history. The moral conception has its origin in the belief in the moral government of the world. This position, however, can neither be deduced from experience nor justified by experience. Ostwald reduces the progress of civilization to transformations of energy from lower to higher forms. But this law is too general to explain history. The theory, moreover, is not deduced from historical facts, but from a preconceived philosophy. Two theories of history are based upon strife. The political conception treats the state as the sovereign influence in history and history itself as made up of the antagonisms of races. According to historical Materi- alism, on the other hand, society is founded upon an economic basis, and the law of history is to be found in economic struggle. But is the law to which all the laws of nature are reducible the law of strife? Is life only an immense and universal carnage? The intellectualistic conception of history is that the advance of man is the result of his natural tendency to discover the truth. But the victory of reason is not complete. MELVIN R-IGG. De la methode en histoire de la philosophie. V. DELBOS. Rev. de Met., XXIV, 3, pp. 279-289. We can study certain of the ancient philosophies only by means of external references. This imposes a very delicate philological task upon us, especially</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 571 when these references are only found in writings interested in relating the doctrines referred to, to those of the writer, or in refuting them. Frequently an attempt is made to construct philosophies from positions stated without explicit references. Schleiermacher attempted this in regard to certain of Plato's statements. Sometimes there is too much material, as in the case of Pythagoras and Pythagoreanism, where the accounts become richer in detail in proportion to the time separating the writer from Pythagoras. The question of authenticity is important, especially in the case of Plato. In Erdmann's edition of Leibniz's works there was published a previously un- published writing, De Vita beat, which, if authentic, would show that Leibniz was at one time a Cartesian, or even Spinozist, in ethics. A close exam- ination of this writing shows that it is merely a collection of pieces taken literally, or almost literally, from the writings of Descartes. The discovery and publication of neglected and unpublished writings sometimes make important alterations in our conception of the philosophy in question. Thus the papyrus discovered at Herculaneum shows that the Epicureans, while opposed to formal logic, made a remarkable attempt to formulate a theory of inductive and analogical reasoning. M. Couturat's publication of certain neglected writings of Leibniz gives Leibniz a new significance in respect to logic. All of the writings of a philosopher are not equally significant. Generally speaking, the systematic and technical writings are to be trusted, rather than correspondence and popular works. The chronology of philosophical writings is important, for the various writings of a philosopher are not necessarily all from one point of view. The recognition of this fact keeps us from seeking a fictitious con- sistency. W. CURTIS SWABEY. Vom Begriff der Nation. BRUNO BAUCH. Kant-Studien, XXI, 2-3, Pp. I39- I62. The word Nation, although not originally German, has become a genuine German word. It is to be traced back to nasci, to be born. The nation, as the community of those born together, is the 'natural' foundation of the unity of a people. This being born together expresses itself in bodily structure. It also expresses itself in the spiritual character of a people. Every people has an individuality, a unique character as a whole which can never be expressed in terms of generalities. As a result of this there are certain insurmountable barriers to mutual understanding between different nations. That which is unique in each nation can never be understood by other nations. Only a German can fully understand Martin Luther. He feels that Luther was 'blood of his blood.' There are characteristics of foreign peoples which Germans cannot understand. But each nation can concretely understand itself, even if it cannot explain itself, i. e., deduce its characteristics from general principles. Understanding of the concrete sort springs only from identification of oneself, not only with the thought, but also with the feeling and willing, of others. Both the bodily and spiritual similarity of those who are 'born to-</page><page sequence="6">572 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. gether' is expressed in language. Language played a great rOle in the unification of the German people. These three things, physical and mental similarity, and language, make up the 'natural' characteristics of a nation. There are also cultural and historical characteristics. In history a nation first comes to itself; those 'born together' attain to national consciousness. Natural and cultural characteristics are to be sharply set asunder that they may later be given adequate interconnection The historical, i. e., cultural character of a people implies two moments: the land and the state. The land is sometimes looked upon as absolutely characteristic of the life of a people, but this view leaves out of account wandering peoples and members of those 'born together' who keep up the national spirit while living in foreign lands. Here there appears a distinction between the nation as a mere community of those 'born together' and the nation as the historical unity of a people, for in the idea of the latter the notion of land plays a definite part. The land becomes a Father- land through the labors of the 'born together' who bequeath it to future mem- bers of the same community. It is the scene of the creating of those cultural goods into which we are born, and which we must make our own and advance. The Fatherland is not only a product (Gegebenheit) of the past, it is also a task and goal for the future (Aufgegebenheit). Love of the Fatherland is not a mere inclination; it is an obligatory love, like the love of parents. In the love of Fatherland we grasp the nation as the bearer of an ethical and divine meaning to which we must sacrifice ourselves. State and nation are to be distinguished, although they are inseparably united. The views of the En- lightenment as to the state and natural rights were behind even the practice of the time. For in that very age Frederick the Great was adopting a new ideal. Already in Kant there are signs of a new conception of the state. Fichte played a great part in the development of the conception of the state. He taught that freedom was not being free from compulsion, but being free for a purpose. The state was to make the nation a nation; and its compulsion was for the purpose of freeing the nation from all hindrances to its self-expression. The relation between the natural and cultural moments of the nation becomes clear when we see that the nation is a 'natural' hereditary community which wins for itself in its common history a 'cultural' unity. In history the ' natural ' potentialities achieve actual expression in the development of 'culture.' In its historical development the nation becomes conscious of its potentialities and of the meaning of these potentialities for itself. Nature is the material; culture, the form of the self-expression of the nation. W. CURTIS SWABEY. Royce as an Interpreter of American Ideals. CHARLES M. BAKEWELL. Int. J. E., XXVII, 3, PP. 306-317. It is a great mistake to suppose that Josiah Royce was mainly a meta- physician; his chief interests were always logic and ethics, and his metaphysical interests sprang from the latter. For him, ethics should become effective through religion on the basis of an ideal founded properly in the real. He did</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 573 not approach religion, however, from the point of view of the believer seeking support for his faith, but as a doubter trying to gain a new and higher view of old values. He was a non-conformist by nature, and he spent his early life in a small mining town in California, where the spirit of the freedom and independence of the individual was still strong. Hence his thoughts naturally turned to a question of great importance for his country, the relation of the individual to the community: "What is the price one must pay for freedom?"' His ethical idealism, accordingly, can be best understood as an interpretation of modern civilization as expressed in his native land. Royce's dialectical' method is well known. It was not necessarily borrowed from Hegel, but was a natural expression of his own mind, which recognized the paradoxical element in all experience. Through it he was led to point out what the dissenter must admit in order to make good his dissent; that scepticism implies a positive ideal; that the existence of error proves the reality of God. This method, applied to vital ethical questions of the hour, showed that the moral law is not a finished work once for all written down by authority, nor an unmodified expression of self-will, but consists in the individual's learning to love authority and finding an authority worthy of love. This is essentially the problem of American civilization, and Royce discusses it in his Religious Aspects of Ex- perience. He points out that the ethical ideal cannot be founded on facts, evolution, or natural science, because it involves evaluation; nor can it be founded on the results of conscience, which has many conflicting aims. Scepticism itself implies the ideal of harmonizing all conflicting aims in the world of life. Here Royce makes a questionable extension of his principle, maintaining that the highest good would be attained if all conflicting wills fully realized each other. This extension seems unwarranted, for how are we to pass from the doctrine that each will is an embodiment of the universal reason to the principle that each should not only seek the ideal for himself, but also try to realize the aims of all? The subsequent reflection that Royce gave to the problem of the individual, his concern to find elbow-room for him in the world of the Absolute, may be viewed as an attempt to bridge this gap in his earlier theory. In the Problem of Christianity, he tells us that the in- dividual is a mere abstraction; that from the very first our consciousness is social; that truth-seeking itself and all kinds of purposeful activity are social enterprises. A community is thus posited, at least in ideal, which harmonizes and organizes all conflicting wills, and which implies that each realizes the true inner life of the others. Thus all hatreds and jealousies will pass, in so far as this moral insight is promoted in all. The moral ideal is, then, the spirit of fair play among the conflicting wills of men. This does not mean com- promise, however, for it is absolutely wrong that an individual or nation through ruthless egotism should force its will on others, and one thing is absolutely right, the willing and thorough-going devotion of an individual to a cause. Royce makes many applications of his moral ideal. For example, he says that the negro problem will never be solved, until the white man ceases to parade as superior to the black; until he makes real to himself the negro's</page><page sequence="8">574 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. inner life and acts toward him in the spirit of fair play. Second, in his book War and Insurance, the same key-note is struck as regards international re- lations. Royce could not help seeing in Germany the ruthless egotist who is the foe of the very foundation principle of morality, the harmony of interests and wills. To him, therefore, Germany appeared as the opponent, not only of modern civilization, but of the spirit of America. F. W. A. MILLER. Science is One of the Humanities. J. B. BAILLIE. The Hibbert Journal, XV, 3, PP- 353-373. The controversy over the relative place of science and the humanities in a scheme of education is the reflection of a fundamental opposition, deep-rooted in western civilization, arising from the apparent conflict between the aims and interests of human life and the ruthlessly objective course of nature. Science, from one point of view, is the consummate achievement of man: it places him at the crown of nature, and, paradoxically enough, this place seems to have been won by applying the supposition that nature is independent, outside human interests, coldly indifferent, if not opposed, to man's ideals. But the conflict rests on a misconception of the meaning of nature and of the pro- cedure of science. The scientist wrongly designates as nature the object or objects of his theoretic endeavors, as something independent of human desires and interests, before which man must bow down in submission. He seeks to discover its laws in their independent character, neglecting the fact that, although 'nature' is outside man spatially, man himself is part of nature, and that, although man must discover nature's laws, objective nature is not opposed or indifferent to human nature. Again, the scientist conceives his own method as a sort of process of holding his mind open to let the laws of nature shine in upon it, as if his mind were a still mirror reflecting nature's processes. But in reality the mind in scientific investigation is active, alive; it fights nature, winning it over by force, if necessary, into harmony with thought. In the first stages of scientific procedure, distinctions and definitions are made simply to facilitate and make perfect our intellectual constructions; our thought and its aims determine our endeavors from first to last. Also, in the results of science, in the laws it discovers and in the conceptions it develops, the operation of the human intellect is evident. Quantity, force, mass, and weight are the human ways in which man thinks the facts presented to him. Nature does not give him his knowledge, but it is his own construction, a form of human energy, depending, not on the necessity of things, but on the necessity of thought, in which hypotheses and experiments are the necessary factors. When its results are false, science does not hesitate to attribute the error to the human mind; why, then, should it not say the same thing about its truth? Mathematics is no exception to this general rule of all science; that its principles are uniN ersally accepted only shows how completely they depend on the very structure of the human mind. When we pass on to the more concrete sciences, like biology, we are only the more convinced that science is through and through</page><page sequence="9">No. 5.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 575 anthropomorphic. Another line of argument leads to the same conclusion. The scientific mood is only one of the many historical expressions of the full life of humanity, and as such it is conditioned by the same general factors that determine the other expressions. Particularly does it depend on racial and climatic conditions, which confine it to a definitely bounded geographical area and to a people of definite racial qualities, where and with whom alone it can attain its ends. It is, in short, the creation of the European west; one of the factors in the life of humanity, but not essentially inherent in the life of all people. If science is, therefore, so closely related to human life, what, more definitely, are the relations between the ends of science and the other ends which men pursue? All the aims of life may be classified conveniently into three,- truth, beauty, and goodness, each corresponding to and fulfilling, respectively, one of the factors in man's mental constitution,-intellect, feeling, and will., The claims of will, pursued exclusively, create morality and social institutions; those of feeling create art and literature; those of intellect, science and phi- losophy. But these three aims cannot remain separate except on paper, because it is the individual man who pursues in them the unity of his spiritual life, and only by the cultivation of them all does he attain his true spiritual stature. Yet all nations'do not cultivate all these ends in like degree, the aims of morality being most universally pursued, while truth for truth's sake is most generally neglected, and this gives us a criterion by which to determine the value of different civilizations. Further, these three goods are internally related, mutually reciprocal; the cultivation of any one of them enriches the other two. Looking at one of them as the true end, as the all in all, either in theory or in practice, is indefensible, because the enrichment of human life in its entirety depends on the proportionate development of all three. Nor are all of these ends equally fundamental. Sociality, or the socialization of human life, is first in importance, but this is not based on practical action alone, but also on community of thought and feeling. It is false, on the one hand, to evaluate science on the basis of what it contributes to social life, and, on the other, to judge social life valuable merely in terms of scientific advance. Simi- larly, the supposed opposition between science and the humanities is one of the most grotesque of popular fallacies. Science is one of the humanities, one of the factors which enrich human life. The term 'humanities' should not be confined to Greek and Roman literature, nor even to literature alone; sculpture, music, and painting must be included, but above all must science, since man, in order to be himself, must be interested in the course of events outside, and in science he unites that outer course with his own inner rationality, Unless human interests turn to science, and unless science makes human life more intelligent, both have failed in their purpose. F. W. A. MILLER, Loize, Bradley, and Bosanquet. AGNES CUMING. Mind, N. S., Vol. XXVI, No. I02, pp. i62-17I. Lotze held that while reality may be more extensive than our capacities for representing it, we are not interested in it beyond the range of intelligent ex-</page><page sequence="10">576 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. perience. But in the field of intelligent experience he held that thought played a subordinate ryle, sensation, perception, memory, feeling, and volition all being parts of intelligent experience. He held that thought works upon an alien material, sense, and is guided by feeling. Thought is a discursive faculty, occupied with the universal and the abstract; its function is purely formal. For Bradley, reality, the Absolute, is a whole beyond the act of judgment and presenting itself as an Other which thought cannot attain. Bosanquet, on the other hand, postulates the M orld as a rational system. Judgment functions as a progressive articulation within the postulated system. Bosanquet thus avoids Bradley's scepticism. On the question of the criterion of truth, Lotze believed in self-evident truths: the criterion was an immediate feeling of self- evidence. For Bradley, truth is impossible, for in attaining it we pass beyond relational thought to a higher level. For Bosanquet, the criterion of truth is system. The ultimate systematic character of the world, he assumes: in itself it is neither self-evident, nor capable of proof. Lotze sets up a complete dualism between thought and sense, but seemed to hold to a chance coincidence between the two. In Bradley, the dualism persists, but with a sceptical result. In Bosanquet the problem is more satisfactorily solved by the postulate of rationality. But even in him traces of dualism persist: thus he seems to at- tribute superior reality to what is given by sense, to the 'this' of perception. Objectivity is adequately defined in terms of the compulsion reality exercises upon thought. W. CURTIS SWABEY. Dewey and Urban on Value Judgment. R. B. PERRY. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., XIV, 7, pp. I69-I8i. Among the views which regard the practical judgment as constitutive of values, two classes may be distinguished, the humanistic, which construes judgment in a psychological sense, and the absolutistic, which construes it in a logical sense. Dewey may be taken as a representative of the former school. He presents the crux of the matter when he says, "To judge value is to engage in instituting a determinate value where none is given." In criticism of Dewey's position it is important to keep the following consideration in mind: "It is impossible to interpret any judgment merely from its verbal record." The identity of a judgment depends on what it virtually appeals to for its disproof or verification. Every judgment has objective reference of two sorts. In the first place it is about something whose reality is not in question. Sec- ondly, there is something judged. The former may be termed the 'object' of the judgment, and regarded as a constituent of both alternative facts. What is judged about anything we may term the 'objective' of the judgment; it is a hypothetical fact, that toward which my motor set is directed. Dewey's failure to state what constitutes the identity of a judgment makes criticism of his view difficult, but upon examination it seems he can offer no case of a value's being constituted by a judgment of it. To take the example of the situation in which one suffers from ill-health: my judging that I dislike my</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 577 present symptoms is a simple perceptual judgment. In so far as I desire recovery my future recovery is good, but that I should be aware of my desire introduces no new factors. The belief that the consulting of physicians con- duces to recovery is not peculiar to a practical situation. What gives value to the plan is not its relation to the sequel, but the affective attitude to it which my judgment as to the sequel has led me to take. The object of the attitude of hope possesses value by virtue of the component of desire. When the situation is completed by my recovery of health we have value in two new senses, "An existence may be said to possess value as fulfilling desire and as being the immediate object of feeling." In Dewey's theory the con- dition of health was due to the antecedent judgments concerning it. It is possible to avoid this paradox of a judgment which is somehow antecedent to a part of itself, if we provide an 'objective,' or ' hypothetical,' as the content of the antecedent judgment, and distinguish it from the later existence. We have then a judgment, not bringing about its own objective component but bringing about the existence which exemplifies its objective component. Perry's conclusion is, then, that practical judgments do not call for an amend- ment of our ordinary notions of judgment. Urban professes to be of the same mind as Dewey, but holds that 'value- judgment' is to be distinguished from all 'judgments of truth and fact.' Urban points out first that value attaches not to objects but objectives. But this is peculiar neither to value nor to judgment. Secondly, he argues that there are certain a prior propositions about value, coordinate with the a prior propositions about being. But these alleged a priori propositions seem either to be applications of certain ones concerning being or to be obtained from the empirical character of interest. Thirdly, Professor Urban insists that the conception of 'ought' is irreducible to the categories of being and not-being. But all judgments involving variables assert something only hypothetically existential. Nor can the prospective character of judgments of 'ought' be made a basis of distinction between 'value-judgments' and 'judgments of truth and fact.' The commonest of all scientific judgments are those concern- ing the future. The cause of the muddle is a confusion of the essential act of judgment with the motor-affective attitude with which it is psychologically associated. What is needed is a definition of judgment in the abstract. VIRGINIA BAKER.</page></plain_text>
