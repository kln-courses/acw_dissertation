<plain_text><page sequence="1">S. Tamar Kamionkowski and Wonil Kim (eds.), Bodies, Embodiment and Theology of the Hebrew Bible. LH BOTS 465. x + 250 pp. T &amp; T Clark, New York and London, 2010. Images of the body invariably attract, if not fascinate, and this is no less true of representations of the divine body in the Hebrew Bible. Building on the anthropological insights of Mary Douglas, Tamar Kamionkowski explains that the purpose of this collection is to explore developments in three related areas: First, the nature of divine embodiment and the relationship "between God s body and the body politic" (p. 2). Second: the interaction between human - divine encounters in biblical tradition, and third: the implications of a more expansive view of embodiment in religious life. This wide-ranging brief risks providing only superficial engagement with what are substantially complex questions. Yet the scholars involved have risen to the challenge well and there is considerable depth in the majority of contributions in this volume. In Section I: "Gods Biblical Bodies", elements of Benjamin Sommers important work, The Bodies of God and the World of Ancient Israel (New York: CUP, 2009) are developed in Amy Merrill Willis discussion of "Heavenly Bodies: God and the Body in the Visions of Daniel". Here Willis argues that anthropomorphic representations of the deity in the sixth century, specifically in Ezekiel, were grounded in an understanding of divine involvement in the political and historical spheres. Despite the close relationship of Ezekiel 1 to Daniel 7, a profound shift in Daniel 8 occurs, where the separation of God from the role of the king subsequently develops. Ultimately this perceived absence of God enables the prophetic vision to expand into non-cultic and non- political spheres. An equally impressive piece is provided by Claudia Bergmann, in "Like a Warrior and Like a Woman Giving Birth: Expressing Divine Immanence and Transcendence in Isaiah 42:10-17". Bergmann examines these stereotypical male and female similes, arguing that they were deliberately combined to highlight the experience of life and death crises, if not also the paradox foreshadowing eventual divine salvation. Next liana Zsolnay considers the psychological implications of one of the most notable "porno-prophetic" texts, in "The Inadequacies of Yahweh: A Re-examination of Jerusalems Portrayal in Ezekiel 16", where Zsolnay examines Gods "battering personality", "abandonment issues" and "inferiority complex" (pp. 72-73): a study which will undoubtedly generate further discussion of the schizophrenic nature of the divine psyche. An evaluation of the significance of political rhetoric - as (for example) in Cynthia Chapman's The Gendered Language ofWarfare in the Israelite-Assyrian Encounter. Harvard Semitic Monographs, 62. (Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns, 2004) - would also accommodate the historical context of Ezekiel's representation. Section II, "Human Biblical Bodies" commences with Jeremy Schipper s contribution: "Embodying Deuteronomistic Theology in 1 Kings 1 5:22- 24". Schipper explores the interface between theology, retribution and illness, demonstrating how "physical descriptions allow narrators to express abstract theological notions within the material world of the text" (p. 88). This is a valuable expansion of his previous treatment: "Deuteronomy 24:5 and King Asa's Foot Disease in 1 Kings 1 5:23b" JBL 128.4 (Winter 2009), 643-648. In "Profaning the Body: ^nn and the Conception of Loss of Personal Holiness in H", Hilary Lipka provides a compelling account of how descriptions of holiness are perceived as fully corporeal in biblical tradition. This is followed by Eve Levavi Feinstein's discussion of the gendered nature of sexual defilement in "Sexual Pollution in the Hebrew Bible: A New Perspective", where she demonstrates that this is distinct from other forms of ritual or moral impurity. The phrase. . b "[]"QDU&gt; fnrrtò in Leviticus 18:20 and 23 is, however, rendered: "you</page><page sequence="2">Book List / Vetus Testamentům 62 (2012) 284-298 297 shall not put your penis into" (p. 139), where the NRSV (2007) provides "you shall not have sexual relations with" and the JPS (1999) "do not have carnal relations with". While there is no practical difference in the designated prohibited activity, Feinsteins translation disregards the convention of the biblical scribes, who depict sexual organs only euphemistically - as Marvin Pope has clarified in "Euphemism and Dysphemism in the Bible", Anchor Bible Dictionary: Volume I (New York: Doubleday, 1992), 720-725. This minor concern does not detract from the logic of her overall argument. To complement these discussions, Matthew Schlimm then surveys the presence of rage in the primeval and patriarchal narratives, in "Emotion, Embodiment and Ethics: Engaging Anger in Genesis". The last section is entitled: "Gods Bodies, Human Bodies and Todays Reader". Here Esther Hamori provides a sophisticated account of "Divine Embodiment in the Hebrew Bible and Some Implications for Jewish and Christian Incarnational Theologies". Hamori argues that the Christian idea of incarnation represents a clear and natural development of the biblical theophanies, which is important for understanding Jesus as divine - i.e. not only as a previous manifestation of God, but as an individual who continues to be one with God. This is conspicuously different to the reception of anthropomorphic realism in early rabbinic tradition, even in light of later kabbalistic ideology, where the Torah itself is viewed as the incarnation of the image of God. Gerald West then examines, "The Contribution of Tamars Story to the Construction of Alternative African Masculinities", using "the notion of praxis", (p. 187) which responds to the ongoing cycle of dramatic action in biblical narrative and engages reflection in the communal consciousness. Finally, Howard Eilberg-Schwartz focuses on the subjective nature of individual reading, in "Does God Have a Body? The Problem of Metaphor and Literal Language in Biblical Interpretation". This engaging volume will stimulate additional questions in several related areas, where the use of anthropomorphic cult-images, if not also to representations of Yahweh and His Asherah, have yet to be fully understood. Both Wonil Kim and Tamar Kamionkowski are to be congratulated for their fine editing of this panoramic, yet thought-provoking, selection. [Sandra Jacobs]</page></plain_text>
