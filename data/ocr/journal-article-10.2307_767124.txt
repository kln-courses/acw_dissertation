<plain_text><page sequence="1">Medieval Art without Style? Plato's Loophole and a Modern Detour JAMES TRILLING Abstract Although Henry Maguire's call for papers could have been read as an invitation to reconsider the role of style, the five studies printed here are united in rejecting style in favor of function as a guide to medieval art. In part this reflects a shift of focus in art history generally: new ques- tions are being asked which style cannot answer. But style-based art history, for its part, has failed to keep pace. It remains a prisoner of its own subjectivity, exem- plified by the equation of abstraction and spirituality. Widely assumed to derive from Christian Neoplatonism, this equation is in fact modern. It is rooted in Schopen- hauer's idiosyncratic interpretation of the Platonic Ideas, as elaborated by Wilhelm Worringer in Abstraction and Empathy (1908). Although Worringer showed that it is possible to appreciate much of the world's art without reference to Greco-Roman standards, his approach did not take account of styles which appear abstract to us but were considered naturalistic by their practitioners. Rec- ognition of Worringer's influence, and of the flaws in his vision, provides a starting-point for a new interpretation of style in medieval art, perhaps to be based on Aristotelian instead of Platonic models. These five papers deal with medieval art from Byz- antium to Western Europe, and from late antiquity to the renaissance. Despite their diversity, two common themes emerge. The first is an overwhelming emphasis on religious art. Even the two papers which might qualify as exceptions have a strong religious component. Helen Saradi describes a society in which the civic ideal of urban beauty gives way increasingly to one centered on the outward signs of the city's religious life. And Jean Campbell shows us how easily religious imagery served the needs of satire. The other thing which all five papers have in common is the way their authors have interpreted Henry Maguire's ini- tial call for papers. "This session," he wrote, "is devoted to beauty, quality and Art in the Middle Ages, concepts that are out of fashion now, but are due for a re-evaluation." Beauty, quality and Art, it would appear, are still out of fashion, per- haps even more than Professor Maguire imagined when he planned the panel, certainly more than I imagined when I accepted his invitation to serve as discussant. Working in isolation from one another, but subject to the same profes- sional Zeitgeist, the five authors have removed the question mark from the session's title. Instead of re-evaluating the concepts of "beauty, quality and Art" as they apply to the middle ages, they have set out, in very different ways, to provide alternatives to these concepts. There is a connection between the emphasis on reli- gious art and an ambivalent, even covertly hostile attitude toward Art. Whatever, exactly, that capital "A" means, it has something to do with the exaltation of purely aesthetic factors-to speak more bluntly, of style. The role of style in medieval religious art is notoriously difficult to assess. We have probably all had the experience of associating a style with a particular shade or degree of spirituality, only to realize that contemporaries did not see it that way at all. When this happens, we have a choice. We can assume that medieval people responded aesthetically to works of art more or less as we do, but for some reason almost never wrote about it. Or we can assume that they responded aes- thetically in ways quite different from ours, which we would nonetheless recognize as aesthetic responses-but that they still didn't write about it. Or we can assume that they did not respond in anything like our terms, that they never saw Art but saw only symbols, reminders, ritual ob- jects, luxury objects-and wrote down their responses with perfect directness and clarity. The history of medieval art without Art (no question mark here) flirts with the second of these possibilities but embraces the third. This third assumption, that the makers and users of medieval religious art saw it in ways that are incompatible with modern notions of Art, is attractive be- cause it holds out the hope of objectivity. It requires that we confront the past on its own terms, not ours, something which every scholar should be eager to do. In essence, it substitutes a functional definition of medieval art for an aes- thetic one. What matters is not how the work of art looks, but what it did, or what was done with it. One functional approach is the so-called "history of im- ages," which has become especially popular because of Hans Belting's work and the 1990 Dumbarton Oaks symposium on the holy image.' Elizabeth Lipsmeyer's paper embodies this approach in its purest form. She is uncompromising in her refusal to interpret; what matters is the ritual event and the image's role in it. The experience as a whole is evidently un- translatable into modern aesthetic terms, and even the con- cept of decorum which pervades it is only defined by implication, by the use of comparisons. Byzantine icons and icon-worship are the locus classicus for functionalism in medieval art. The terms of inquiry and debate, formulated by the Byzantines themselves, require that in asking how the image functioned, we also ask what the im- age was, its precise relation to the holiness of its subject. The GESTA XXXIV/1 ? The International Center of Medieval Art 1995 57</page><page sequence="2">question remains paramount because the Byzantine icon had a double function. It did not just participate in the religious life of the community as a quasi-autonomous agent. It was also a means by which the viewer-worshipper was brought into more direct contact with the divine. St. Basil wrote, "The honor of the image passes to the prototype."2 Charles Barber guides us safely through the maze of arguments surrounding the relation of image and prototype, culminating in Nike- phoros and the shift from an essentialist to a formalist para- digm. (I never thought anyone could make it look so easy!) It is Dr. Barber's contention that with this shift the icon as func- tional image crosses over into the realm of Art. In principle I have no quarrel with this. In practice it seems to me that both circumscription and inscription belong to what Belting calls the history of images. Granted that the theological im- plications are different, does the image-maker-the artist-- approach the image-as-likeness in a different way from the image-as-presence? Does the image look different as a result? Before and after Nikephoros, the bottom line is that the image is supposed to be true. Before and after Nikephoros, the pre- sumption of truth, though interpreted in quite different ways, permitted a high degree of experimentation in the excerpting and re-combination of images. Students of early Christian art may all too easily become blas6 about this process, which they encounter every day in the formation and evolution of Christian iconography. Still, it is worth remembering that what an image says can be as im- portant as what it does. Information can be a means of ana- gogy, not only in the medieval west, with its topos of images as the books of the illiterate, but also in Byzantium, where the truth of an image places it on a par with the text of scripture. Good old-fashioned iconography is in this sense another functional approach, but far removed from the history of im- ages. Professor Campbell gives us a vivid reminder of the versatility of image-manipulation. There is nothing mechan- ical about it; it easily bridges the most difficult gaps, between biblical and secular themes, and between low humor and high moral seriousness, and is perfectly capable of mocking its own conventions. Joanna Ziegler's paper captures the precise moment of transition between the mindset of medieval images and that of Art as we know it. Her account of Michelangelo's relation to the northern pieta tradition focuses on the ways in which he transmuted the "functional" image of popular devotion into an "aesthetic" image: in particular, the use of marble to protect and distance the image from the disfigurements of cult practice and to define it as something self-sufficient, permanent, superior. There is an irony here, at which Pro- fessor Ziegler hints in her remark about Michelangelo being attracted on an artistic level by what repelled him on a reli- gious level. What Michelangelo rejected in the name of a new and transcendent vision of Art was not just the practice of attaching things to religious images with nails. It was also the use of a distinctive style for a distinct religious purpose. An exaggerated style, granted, and one all too easy to asso- ciate with "mere" popular fervor, but a style nonetheless. It is an irony within an irony, that Michelangelo did not com- pletely reject the "virtuoso over-manipulation" of his wood- carving predecessors. This virtuosity finds an analogue in his own virtuoso handling of marble drapery, as though he sought to displace onto it an intensity of feeling which the figures could not decorously bear. This brings us back, circuitously, to the visual aspects of medieval art. I do not wish to denigrate the importance of function. Our understanding of medieval art would be hope- lessly incomplete if it did not take into account what the art did and what it said. But by the same token, if we can re- introduce style without imposing our own tastes and assump- tions, it would be irresponsible not to do so. This is especially true of religious art. For decades, we have implicitly relied on an extremely narrowly focused theological aesthetic, in which not only the content but the style of a work of art en- lightens the viewer or worshipper.3 The first step toward a new understanding of medieval style is to ask how this aes- thetic relates to both medieval and modern ways of looking. To all appearances it is an outgrowth of Christian Neo- platonism. According to Pseudo-Dionysius, "We see our hu- man hierarchy pluralized in a great variety of perceptible symbols lifting us upward hierarchically until we are brought as far as we can be into the unity of divinization.'"4 If a sym- bol is anything that conveys the mind from one level of un- derstanding to another, then anything, including style, can be a symbol. But some styles more than others. As we know from the parable of the cave, Plato considered sensuous "re- ality" a mere shadow of the true Reality.5 Since a created im- age is a shadow of a shadow, Platonism should by all rights be completely hostile to art as a means of anagogy. But Plato left a loophole. If the representation of individual objects leads not toward but away from their true nature, the reverse might also be true. Art that bypasses the specific might help the viewer rise about the world of sense-perception. Such art would be a legitimate adjunct to Platonism. Beyond doubt there is the basis for a theological aes- thetic of style here. But whose aesthetic is it? The answer, almost certainly, is ours. Pagan and Christian thinkers elabo- rated the Platonic cosmology in great detail, with the Ideas as a ladder from the sensuous and corporeal world to the spiri- tual. But this elaboration takes place almost exclusively in philosophy and theology.6 We may infer that it applied in a general sense to art. But when we try to understand just how it applied, in particular how it applied to style, the sources are not just silent, they suggest a completely different approach. In his homily of 867 on the new apse mosaic of the Virgin in H. Sophia, Photios has this to say: With such exactitude has the art of painting, which is a reflection of inspiration from above, set up a lifelike im- itation. For, as it were, she fondly turns her eyes on her 58</page><page sequence="3">begotten Child in the affection of her heart, yet assumes the expression of a detached and imperturbable mood at the passionless and wondrous nature of her offspring, and composes her gaze accordingly. You might think her not incapable of speaking, even if one were to ask her, "How didst thou give birth and remainest a virgin?" To such an extent have the lips been made flesh by the co- lours, that they appear merely to be pressed together and stilled as in the mysteries, yet their silence is not at all inert neither is the fairness of her form derivatory, but rather is it the real archetype.7 We must allow for the conventions of ekphrasis.8 Pho- tios is not just describing a visual image, but creating his own verbal one. Yet he adheres closely to the mosaic. His evocation of its human warmth does not bypass the stylistic features that we would consider non-naturalistic, e.g. the Virgin's "detached and imperturbable mood." Rather, it ex- plicitly acknowledges and incorporates them, to the greater emotional and theological complexity of the image. The detached or passionless qualities of the mosaic contribute to its spiritual efficacy, but only because they are interpreted as human qualities. What we might see as transcendence, Pho- tios treats as character exposition. Already in antiquity Plato's loophole was recognized and exploited, but in ways that contradict our equation of anti-naturalism and spirituality. As Erwin Panofsky shows in his book Idea, in art theory the Platonic Ideas quickly came to mean something like an awareness of the ideal, of how an object might look if it were perfect.9 This awareness comes from studying the imperfect beauty of many individ- ual objects. A great artist is one who sees past the specific to the ideal beauty of animate or inanimate form. The aim is to refine or ennoble nature, not to transcend it. Abstraction in the modern sense is not a thing to be desired for its own sake, or a symbol of spirituality. This accommodation of Platonism and art survives al- most to our own century, yet it carries the seeds of a trans- formation which shapes our aesthetic and historical sense. According to Arthur Schopenhauer, art repeats the eternal Ideas apprehended through pure con- templation, the essential and abiding element in all the phenomena of the world ... For it plucks the object of its contemplation from the stream of the world's course, and holds it isolated before it. This particular thing, which in that stream was an infinitesimal part, becomes for art a representative of the whole, an equivalent of the infi- nitely many in space and time. It therefore pauses at this particular thing; it stops the wheel of time; for it the re- lations vanish; its object is only the essential, the Idea.'o For Schopenhauer the Platonic vision offers more than idealized nature. To stop the wheel of time is to take the ob- ject "out of nature," in Yeats' phrase. The idea that abstrac- tion does not just improve on nature, but transcends it, foreshadows the poet's "artifice of eternity.""' But the deci- sive influence on our understanding of abstraction is neither Schopenhauer nor Yeats. It is Wilhelm Worringer's Abstrac- tion and Empathy, first published in 1908.12 I do not know if anyone still reads Worringer. His ideas have been so well as- similated, it is strange to think of them as the work of a sin- gle person. Stranger still that they are the work of a graduate student in his mid-twenties, the kind of precocious break- through that we take for granted in the mathematical sci- ences but scarcely believe possible in the humanities. Worringer's distinction between empathy and abstrac- tion-broadly speaking, between acceptance and rejection of nature in all its variety and specificity-is useful but hardly earth-shaking. What gives the book its power is that for Worringer abstraction is not the process of distilling the best in nature, it is an alternative to nature. Nor is it just an independent force in the history of art. It is the primary force, with empathy a rare exception. The book revolves around a single idea: "the history of the imitation impulse is a different thing from the history of art."'" For almost a century this has been an axiom; its Gordian-knot-cutting originality is forgotten. One of the great pioneers of mod- ernism, Worringer gave theoretical voice to a view of style which the artists of his time were only beginning to em- brace. He re-directed the history of art in such a way that the most radical innovations of his day-and, proof of his success, those of succeeding generations-fell easily into place as part of the mainstream. Worringer's influence on the study of medieval art is in- calculable. Earlier thinkers such as Ruskin might extol medi- eval art, even to the point of setting it above the work of antiquity and the renaissance, but their views remain eccen- tric. The "imitation impulse" had too strong a hold. The mainstream continued to be defined by the idealized natu- ralism of Greece, Rome and the renaissance. Everything from late antiquity to the fifteenth century is an interregnum. Under these conditions no admiration for medieval art, how- ever intense, is unqualified, unless it be the quixotism of a Ruskin. Deny it as we may, we can never free ourselves of the patronizing assumption that medieval art is a triumph over adversity, a display of what could be done without the tools of truth: perspective, proportion, shading, and most of all, the first-hand study of nature. Worringer attacks this assumption at its source, by overturning the superiority of naturalism/empathy: The primal artistic impulse has nothing to do with the rendering of nature. It seeks after pure abstraction as the only possibility of repose within the confusion and ob- scurity of the world-picture, and creates out of itself, with instinctive necessity, geometric abstraction. It is the con- summate expression, and the only expression of which 59</page><page sequence="4">man can conceive, of emancipation from all the contin- gency and temporality of the world-picture.14 The debt to Schopenhauer is clear. So are the differences. For Schopenhauer, the ability of art to stop the wheel of time is explicitly linked to the Platonic Ideas. Without explicit ref- erence to Plato or Platonism, Worringer takes Schopenhauer a crucial step further. The goal of abstraction is to wrest the object of the external world out of its natu- ral context, out of the unending flux of being, to purify it of all its dependence upon life, i.e. of everything about it that was arbitrary, to render it necessary and irrefraga- ble, to approximate it to its absolute value ... 15 By equating the timeless absolute with a particular stylistic mode, Worringer not only gave abstraction its distinctively modern meaning, he made it the center of a new "Platonist" aesthetic. To crown this achievement, he made it irresistible to the modern temper: Amongst a people with [a predisposition to empa- thy], this sensuous assurance, this complete confidence in the external world, this unproblematic sense of being at home in the world, will lead, in a religious respect, to a naive anthropomorphic pantheism or polytheism, and in the respect of art to a happy, world-revering natural- ism. Neither in the former nor in the latter will any need for redemption be disclosed.16 From this moment on, mastery of nature is no longer the measure of artistic progress. The abstract styles need no apology: they are part of the grand existential adventure that culminates in modernism. Few in our century have dared to choose mere happiness-"the unproblematic sense of being at home in the world"-over the glamour of a "great inner unrest" and an "immense spiritual dread of space."17 But there is a twist. Medieval art is inseparable from Christian- ity. Abstraction may signal a longing for transcendence and redemption, but this is precisely the longing which Christi- anity promised to satisfy. Christian art embodies fear and consolation, the yearning and the goal. When Worringer finds in abstraction "the only possibility of repose," he is not really writing about the past. Salvation through style implies not only a distinctive faith in the power of art, but an unprecedented sense of spiritual nakedness. Worringer's real subject is his own world. We have inherited much from that world, but not every- thing. Stylistic absolutes are no longer enough, or some of us would not have come together to explore alternatives to Art in medieval art history. Worringer's modernist Platonism assumes that sensuous reality is a veil of illusion, and that abstract forms come closest to the absolute. This is Worrin- ger's great achievement, freeing most of the world's art from invidious comparisons with Greco-Roman naturalism. It is also the great flaw in his vision. Abstraction as a universal language makes no allowance for cultures with different ideas of reality and different conventions for depicting it.18 If, as Worringer says, "the suppression of life that is manifested, for instance, in Byzantine mosaics tells us at once that here the need for empathy... cannot possibly have determined artistic volition," what are we to make of Photios?19 It is the question I asked at the beginning of this essay: did people in the middle ages see as we do, but write about it differently, or did they see differently as well? Style as we un- derstand it-something with its own distinctive content, which need not be directly related to the subject of the im- age-does not exist for Photios. From a modern point of view, the fact that he sees anecdotal or emotional detail where we see formal detail is a sign of medieval literal-mindedness, as against modern visual sophistication. It could as easily be the other way around. The impulse to see more in art than is objectively there (by modern standards of objectivity) is not to be dismissed lightly. As John Onians showed in 1980, it is the key to understanding abstraction in late antique art; I reached a similar conclusion independently.20 Onians ap- proached the problem through literature and rhetoric, while I approached it through visual analysis. We both found the essential feature of late antique art to be a decrease in the amount of specific information which an artist was expected to incorporate in an image, and a corresponding increase in the viewer's responsibility to reconstruct the complete image mentally. Abstraction is the outward sign of this transfer of responsibility. I do not know if this definition applies to the whole his- tory of art. For late antiquity it means that abstraction does not affect what art communicates, only the way it commu- nicates. Abstraction implies neither a loosening of standards nor a new sensitivity to the spiritual. It is not a separate ar- tistic force, for good or ill. Clearly, Worringer is too much a product of his own cultural moment to be a reliable guide to others; we must rule against him. He is brilliantly, fruit- fully wrong, like Claudius Ptolemy or Lamarck, but wrong nonetheless. Can we do without him and still keep our rev- erence for the visual? Or must art history dwindle as a visual discipline, except in the restricted field of connoisseurship, and become a facet of social and cultural history? Reading an image for anecdotal and emotional nuance is very much a visual skill, however distant from our conven- tions of stylistic and iconographic analysis. The texts quoted by Onians, many of them far more elaborate and vivid than Photios, leave no doubt on this score. Nor must style be di- vorced from spirituality just because there is no such thing as an intrinsically spiritual style. In Greco-Roman and Chris- tian art at least, there is a way to interpret style anagogically without denigrating either sensuous reality or the conven- tions that evolved to depict it. We need only substitute an Aristotelian framework for the Platonic one. In his work On 60</page><page sequence="5">the Soul, Aristotle defines perception as a process of action and transformation: "The sentient subject.., .is potentially such as the object of sense is actually. Thus during the pro- cess of being acted upon it is unlike, but at the end of the pro- cess it has become like that object, and shares its quality."21 In itself this is innocuous, a quasi-scientific description of a quasi-physical process. Transposed to a religious context it becomes something much more significant. If the object of perception is God, or a "symbol" capable of leading the soul toward God, then the very act of perceiving makes the per- ceiver more God-like. Pseudo-Dionysius describes exactly this process, and makes it clear that beauty is one of the objects of perception that assimilate the perceiver to God: ... virtuous conformity to God can only appear as an authentic image of its object when it rivets its attention on that conceptual and fragrant beauty. On this condi- tion-and only on this condition-can the soul impress upon itself and reproduce within itself an imitation of loveliness . . . It is thus with those artists that love beauty in the mind. They make an image of it within their minds. The concentration and the persistence of their contemplation of this fragrant, secret beauty en- ables them to produce an exact likeness of God.22 We know that for Pseudo-Dionysius the world was filled with a hierarchy of symbols. Since physical beauty is a symbol of spiritual beauty, the appreciation of "beauty, quality, and Art"-not just in religious images but in secu- lar art and even ornament-can be a step on the path to God. There is no need for symbolism in the modern sense, however well internalized. What you see is what you get. How much of it you get depends on how well you see, but the process itself does not change. Because it is quasi- physical and intuitively obvious to the point of truism, there is little hope of mapping its influence as we might do with a more abstruse idea. The real question is not how many medi- eval writers, artists and worshipers thought about art in this way, but how many knew they did, let alone knew why. NOTES 1. H.

The search for primi- tive cultural and religious survivals, of which Frazer's The Golden Bough (first published in 1890 and revised more or less continuously until 1913) is the most famous example, legitimized the well-known modernist enthusiasm for "primitive" styles in art, and nourished the modern theology of style. The combined magic of abstraction and primitivism could be irresistible. A case in point is the belief in a class of wooden cult images known as xoana, no longer extant, representing the earliest stage of Greek art and religion. Evidence for xoana as a distinct class of images comes almost exclusively from Pausanias' De- scription of Greece, where the word denotes cult images made of wood. Frazer's monumental commentary on Pausanias, published in 1898, confirmed the centrality of both the text and the definition for scholars seeking to reconstruct the prehistory of Greek culture. But not only did Pausanias base his definition on a false etymology (xoanan from xulon, wood), his careful use of the word in this sense is atypical. According to A. A. Donohue's recent study, for over a thousand years, beginning in the fifth century B.C., the core meaning of xoanon was a statue, usually a cult image. More precise meanings varied signifi- cantly with the period and author (A. A. Donohue, Xoana and the Ori- gins of Greek Sculpture [Atlanta, 1988]). Once scholars accepted the "wooden image" definition, unmistak- ably modern inflections began to creep in. In 1917 Florence M. Ben- nett wrote of the xoana in Pausanias: "It was usual . . . to regard the ancient wooden images with the greatest veneration, the rites associ- ated with them sometimes being intimately bound to very old local legends and customs, sometimes being mystic" (F. M. Bennett, "Prim- itive Wooden Statues which Pausanias Saw in Greece," Classical Weekly, X (1917), 82-86 [84]). And again, "Pausanias consistently confines [the word xoanon] to archaic or archaistic wooden statues of deities" (Bennett, "A Study of the Word -OANON," American Journal ofArchaeology, XXI (1917), 8-21 [17]). The insertion of archaistic is crucial because it makes xoanon a stylistic term. A xoanon is now something that looks archaic. Read together, the two passages imply 61</page><page sequence="6">that the Greeks themselves made a connection between archaic style and archaic belief (whatever they meant by those things). In fact the closest Pausanias came to such an idea is to say of statues attributed to Daedalus, " . . while they are somewhat strange to the eye, still, something divine is also noticeable in them" (Pausanias 2.4.5; quoted in Donohue, Xoana, 370, no. 203). As Donohue shows, xoanon was simply not a stylistic term in antiquity. More important, neither phi- lology nor archaeology supports the theory that wooden cult images represent a distinct historical phase in either religion or art. 19. Worringer, Abstraction and Empathy, p. 14. The existence of ekphra- sis as a concept and a genre demonstrates the emotional basis of Byz- antine art, and is the single most telling argument against Worringer. Even if we cannot easily see what the Byzantines saw, leaping straight to abstraction is not the answer. The current revival of ekphrasis as a critical buzzword reflects the exhaustion of purely formal approaches, and the need for a closer relation of word and image, to bring the full emotional and intellectual weight of content back into art. It is ironic that this revival has managed to bypass Byzantium altogether. R. A. Macdonald is at pains to show that far from being an ancient technical term, ekphrasis is for all practical purposes the creation of modern critics ("Ekphrasis, Paradigm Shift, and Revisionism in Art History," RES, XXIV (1993), 112-23)! 20.
