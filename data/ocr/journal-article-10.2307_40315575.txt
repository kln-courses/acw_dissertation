<plain_text><page sequence="1">Incised Figurine Tablets from Kodiak, Alaska DONALD W. CLARK (Drawings by Jane Isaacs) FOREWORD The writer has worked with the subject of this report for several years. In 1956 while an under- graduate at the University of Alaska and before the larger collections with known context had been ex- cavated he prepared the first manuscript report on incised figurines. Four years later, after the Kizhuyak Bay series had been excavated, the fig- urines were described in a manuscript report of which 30 mimeographed copies were distributed (Clark 1960). Most recently, after excavation of the contextual series at Monashka Bay, a summary re- port describing Kodiak incised figurines was again prepared as part of the manuscript report for Monashka Bay. Accordingly, the ideas, content, and scope of this article have been influenced to varying degrees by many persons who have read and offered com- ments on past manuscripts and the present paper, including past and present members of the anthro- pology departments of the University of Alaska and the University of Wisconsin; Dr. Frederica de Laguna, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania; Dr. Carl Schuster, Woodstock, New York; and by those persons cited in the text who have written on Alaskan incised stones. There remained, however, the onerous task of preparing illustrations of the majority of the en- gravings. Dr. Carl Schuster demonstrated that many of them could be copied by photographic procedures, and the writer had found that reasonably accurate copies could be prepared freehand, but he was re- luctant to take time out from other work and studies to prepare the drawings. Finally through the volun- teer work of Miss Jane Isaacs, an anthropology student at the University of Wisconsin, over 100 incised tablets were drawn. A substantial number of these along with some figurines previously drawn by the writer form the corpus of this report. For the finished product, Mr. Masakazu Yoshizaki, visiting scholar from the Hakodate City Museum, Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan, advised the writer on the use of copy film. INTRODUCTION Sites on Kodiak Island, Alaska have yielded large numbers of incised stone tablets bearing con- ventionalized human representations. An overwhelm- ing majority of the collection has come from two sites near the town of Kodiak: Monashka Bay and Kizhuyak Bay. The figurine-yielding components of these two sites belong to what may be called the northern variant of the late prehistoric Koniag phase, which includes the historic Koniag Eskimo (Clark n.d. b). Similar figurines were made by the pottery- using southwestern Koniags also. The Kizhuyak Bay site is located at one of the channel entrances to Anton Lars en Bay, an arm of Kizhuyak Bay. It was tested in 1-959 by the writer for the Kodiak and Aleutian Islands Historical So- ciety. Sixty incised figurines constitute nearly a third of the small artifact sample from that site. More than 1 00 similar engraved tablets were re- covered by excavation at the Monashka Bay site tested by the same organization in 1961-62. This site is located approximately 4 miles north of the Kodiak business district. It has been disturbed by past construction and collecting, and from surface collections and testing other than that done in 1961 - 62 there are about 50 additional tablets available for description. Some of these Monashka Bay speci- mens lacking context and one Kizhuyak site specimen (upper left in reference cited) were published by Heizer (1952). As at the Kizhuyak Bay site, these figurines were one of the most abundant artifacts and they constitute a quarter of the inventory. DESCRIPTION The engravings are placed on small tabular slate beach pebbles excepting a few instances when fine- 118</page><page sequence="2">Clark: Incised Figurine Tablets from Kodiak grained greywacke or fractured pieces of slate are the medium. At the Kizhuyak Bay site the local slate is somewhat schistose and breaks into blocks and plates. Many Kizhuyak tablets appear to have been split from small slate blocks. They range in length from 3.5 to 17 centimeters and in weight from 3 to nearly 300 grams. Often the stone enters into a unit composition forming the body to which details have been added by engraving. Several tablets have been incised on both sides, and additional unfinished faces are com- mon. Frequently the lines are so lightly incised and disorderly that it is difficult to recognize the features. Two types are recognized: one, represented by about 225 specimens, is readily described in terms of a human face plus details of clothing and orna- mentation; the other type, represented by 4Monashka Bay specimens is not so easily resolved, but the writer suspects that it is a highly abstract form of figurine. The central and defining part of each figure is two arched lines stemming from the middle-top of a group of short, frequently boxed-in, horizontal lines. These represent the mouth and nasal ridge- orbital arches. Frequently eyes are represented be- low the arches. Usually there are several periph- eral groups of lines which are interpreted as hair. The writer feels that the lines beneath the mouth represent a beard although they could perhaps just as well represent tattooing or face painting. The Koniags had light beards and this would sex the figurines as male. Chin tattooing and painting and use of labrets could belong to either sex although ethnographically on Kodiak labrets were more pre- dominently displayed by men and chin tattooing was a female trait. Small circles and beaded lines often are added to the hair lines and they may terminate in a bird's foot motif ( £ A )• These are inter- preted as beads and ornaments. Larger circles, either paired or unilateral, beneath the mouth prob- ably portray labrets. Occasionally an additional group of vertical lines appears below each group of hair lines. Dr. Keithahn has brought to our at- tention an ethnographic example of personal adorn- ment illustrating this explanation (1953). The de- finitive arch lines with or without any combination of these other elements is called the face, and figurines consisting of the face only have been called simple. No fully outlined faces were found. Sometimes various arrangements of lines and even circles are found as a feature above the face. A pair of concentric circles located at each side some distance below the face has appeared in a few specimens. These lateral concentric circles often are placed so far to the sides that only the inward arcs of the circles have been incised. These may represent shoulder joints, arms, misplaced 119 breasts, or arm slits in a cloak. Enthographic re- ports state that sleeves on Koniag cloaks were not functional and slits were provided for access to the outside. All other features below the face are regarded as clothing, especially clothing seams and decorations, and all clothed figurines are called as such. The clothing has been divided into upper and lower groups called middle elements and lower elements , but sometimes a single motif or repetition of elements will occupy all space below the face making such division non applicable. The face constitutes an upper element. Three middle elements, the segmented bandy the V -lines, and a non-cohesive group em- ploying ladder motif bands or panels or spurred lines have been recognized. Sometimes instead of these a simple or spurred horizontal line may transect the tablet. Middle elements run horizontally although they usually dip towards the center, while lower elements usually run vertically. V-lines appear in several forms; V, V with open bottom, U, gently dipping U, and two groups of lateral horizontal lines frequently with a continuous, spurred, dipping top line. Although regarded as portraying clothing, some V-lines could be ribs of the skeleton motif. The seg- mented band is a linear arrangement of groups of short vertical, horizontal, or festooned lines and dots. This band overlies the V-lines when both are pre- sented on the same specimen. This ornate, seg- mented band, and also spurred top V-lines, suggest collars and neck lines, especially the collars found on Aleut garments (Hrdlicka 1945; Fig. 20, 21). Ladder motifs and spurred panel bands are not com- mon, and perhaps for this reason they do not appear to be well demarked as a type of middle element. They may appear solitarily, often repeated to "clothe" the whole figurine, or as the lowest of the three middle elements occurring simultaneously. Inter- grades make rigid classification difficult. Lower elements commonly consist of either simple vertical lines or ramiform (tree) lines. Rare specimens are cross-hatched. They may occur soli- tarily or with any combination of middle elements, but a favorite pattern is the clothed tablet with segmented band and tree lines. STYLISTIC VARIATION Although most tablets belong to one major style, it is not unreasonable to expect minor stylistic vari- ation between different sites and temporally within sites. The sample size for most localities is too small to allow interpretation of the small observed differences. Between Monashka Bay and Kizhuyak Bay we can make more detailed comparisons. Use of the motif rh f+7 as a spur on the top V-line is found on a few Monashka specimens (15, 17, un-</page><page sequence="3">120 numbered, 174; Fig. 2 Id, e_, J., k), and several more specimens have triangular spurs (11, 72, 84, 100, 142, 294, 20; Fig. 2 d, £, h, ±, n). Neither of these motifs are found on Kizhuyak specimens, although in making this comparison we must allow for the much larger sample from Monashka Bay. There are some quantitative differences. For instance, paired hair lines converge and join at one or both ends more frequently in Monashka specimens. Artificial sub- groupings differ between the two sites. Three Kizhuyak specimens indicated as most likely having been made by one person (page 122) would not be confused with any Monashka specimens although there is no major stylistic difference. The same can be said regarding Kizhuyak Bay of 13 Monashka Bay specimens similar to each other, discussed on page 122. Yet I doubt if I could sort out by site facsimiles of any new figurines (excluding items similar to the two sets discussed). ABSTRACT TYPE Four engravings from Monashka Bay cannot be readily resolved into figurines. They are obviously of a different type and the reader is referred to the figures for details (Fig. 4 £-£). Some elements of this type are highly suggestive of the ribs and ver- tebral column of the skeleton motif. One (Fig. 4 j?) suggests the back of a Siberian Shaman's garment. Unfortunately the context of the 3 better specimens is not known. Arctic Anthropology 2, 1 TABLE 1 AND ILLUSTRATIONS Data for the figurines are presented in Table 1. The first column is revised from a manuscript re- port (Clark 1960) in which a tablet engraved on both sides was counted as two figurines, hence 60 tablets from Kizhuyak Bay account for 65 figurines. Engravings showing features of special interest along with many typical specimens are illustrated at 2/3 natural size. K and M suffixes indicate specimens from Kizhuyak and Monashka sites respectively. No. 174m (Fig.2_i) is one of the finest pieces recovered and it presents an excellent illustration of the nomenclature used in this report. Many lines are drawn heavier than the actual engraving. In some figures the ideas of the original artist rather than the specific lines are portrayed. DISTRIBUTION WITHIN SITES Engraved tablets were found throughout the Kizhuyak Bay site, although they were twice as abundant in the lower half of the deposit as in the upper half. Here V-lines were found on specimens located stratigraphically higher (upper 4 feet) than those with the segmented band (lowest 2 l/2 feet). There are 2 exceptions; a segmented band found near the surface, and V-lines on one side of a specimen from near the base of the site. The other side of this specimen displays the segmented band, thus suggesting that these two elements were contemporary as was found at Monashka Bay. Table 1.

The figurines belong almost exclu- sively to the B (upper, brown) layers. Only 4 or 5 were found in the A (lower, black) layers, and these were near the top of that component. This distri- bution is compatable with the writer's finding that the A layers belong to a different non-figurine- making component corresponding to the Uyak Lower Levels (see Heizer 1956). Engraved tablets were absent at Three Saints Bay (University of Wisconsin field work, 1962) which definitely correlates with part of the Uyak Lower Levels. They have not been found associated with contact material although they have been found in sites occupied into the contact period (Rolling Bay, Karluk, Uganik). Unlike the Kizhuyak site, no differential verti- cal distribution was discovered for any of the Monashka elements and motifs, and it is seen that some specimens contain nearly all motifs. However, 121 careful consideration of depth distribution is im- paired by the fact that most tablets were found with- in a 2-2 l/2 foot vertical interval, and where natural layers were simple, very few figurines were found outside a thick compact brown soily layer. Figure 8 «a and Table 2 reflect this localization of the tablets within the lower unit of the B layers. I fear that a rather large number of these speci- mens may have been overlooked during excavation for many engravings are barely discernable. The schistose slate used at Kizhuyak Bay weathers readily and frequently rubs off in paper thin sheets. The collection presents all stages of disappearance due to weathering, and at Kizhuyak Bay many blank tablets which should or could have borne engravings were found. Failure to find these incised tablets at some sites can be explained by their apparent limited temporal distribution. Table 2. Level Distribution of Incised Stones Section 20N-6W (6" levels).

The following year 16 tablets were found within an area little more than a foot square at the edge of an ad- jacent section that was not excavated (No. 164- 179m, Fig. 5 d-r exc. f). These 16 tablets may be- long to a unit of production, a single person, or a group of people acting together; hence, these asso- ciated tablets were examined with special interest. Five tablets are clothed and the other 1 1 are simple. Seven pieces employing beaded lines usually ending in a bird's foot motif may hesitantly be regarded as the work of one man on the basis of this and other criteria. The remainder do not form a homogenous group. A study of these specimens within the context of the other tablets was quite fruitful. The writer picked out those facsimiles that were closely matched on the basis of neatly incised hair lines terminating in beaded lines and bird's foot motifs, being fore-</page><page sequence="5">122 armed with the knowledge that this was a charac- teristic of figurines in the concentration. Results were: 12 tablets very similar and 3 somewhat simi- lar (61, 88, 91). Identification showed that 7 of the 12 came from the concentration (264-5, 271, 273-5, 277), but none of the 3 belonged with these and 4 of the remaining 5 come from deeper in the same section (308, 314, 379, 387, Fig. 4 m , J). Re-exami- nation of tablets in the concentration that had not been selected showed that one of them could be put in with the selected group of twelve. Those re- maining did not form a homogenous group although 2 of them formed a set with an additional specimen from the next lower 6-inch level (269 m, 272 m, 298 m, Fig. 4 k; Fig. 5 d, n). We find then that 1 3 specimens probably were made by the same artist. These include a very strong majority of tablets from the total collection that employ the bird's foot motif and roughly half of the specimens employing beaded lines. Disparity in the depth of a few of these specimens is paral- leled in two other specimens (252 m, 381 m, Fig. 3 h.) that employ identical labret motifs and may have been made by one person. This is viewed as a probable fault in the use of artificial levels. Three specimens from Kizhuyak Bay (Fig. 6 rn, n, p) look like the work of one author, and more ex- tensive excavations might have yielded several more idio-assemblages although there is always the possibility that certain similarities may be the re- sult of persons copying each other's work or work- ing from a common model. FIGURINE TABLETS ELSEWHERE ON KODIAK Long Island. One specimen (Fig. 8 h) was found at an erosion exposure on Long Island near Kodiak town. The site there may have both Koniag (Uyak Upper Level) and Uyak Lower Level compo- nents. Afognak Bay. In 1951 the writer found 8 fig- urine engravings at a small site on Afognak Bay. These were not available for illustration at this writing but they are identical in major respects to those described here. West Side of Kodiak. The writer picked up a figurine engraving on the talus of a deep site at Uganik (Fig. 7 c_). At the same time he visited Hrdlicka's "laguna" site at Uyak (Hrdlicka 1944: 127) and found a very simply incised pebble (Fig. 7 n.), but he found no more during a later careful se~arch of the site. Two slate tablets engraved on both sides from the Uyak site Upper Level are figured and described by Heizer (1947:29102; 1956: 52). The clothing of the Uyak specimens has been given special attention and they are slightly dif- ferent from other Kodiak figurine tablets but prob- Arctic Anthropology 2, 1 ably fall within their range of variation. Fred Milan recovered a disorganized incised tablet from a pot- tery bearing layer in a site at Karluk village (Fig. 7 £) (Unpublished collection at the University of Wisconsin). Rolling Bay. A figurine engraving was found on a broken ulo blade at the late-prehistoric pottery- bearing Rolling Bay site excavated by the University of Wisconsin Aleut-Konyag Prehistory and Ecology Project. The figurine predates the break and some sharpening of the blade. A fragment of slate bears a very poorly executed figurine incising, and there is some uncertainty about the face on a third, par- tially obliterated, specimen (Fig. 7 k.). There are about 800 other artifacts in the collection, hence obviously figurine incising was not practiced here like it was near Kodiak town (Clark, n.d. a). Kiavak 419. No incised tablets were found at the late-prehistoric pottery bearing site Kiavak 418 sampled by the University of Wisconsin Aleut-Konyag project in 1963 (Clark, n.d. a). This is congruent with the results from nearby Rolling Bay which prob- ably is contemporaneous with Kiavak 418 and yielded twice the sample size but only 3 incised tablets. At another, multi-component, site, Kiavak 419, 4 incised tablets were found in a pottery bearing component (Fig. 8 Id, _f, J.), and one came from an early pre-pottery component (Fig. 8 £). The last specimen is incomplete and we cannot be certain that it is a figurine engraving. The remainder are to a large degree like those from Kizhuyak and Monashka Bay. Uncertainty surrounds the exact temporal place- ment of the components yielding these specimens. FIGURINE TABLETS ELSEWHERE IN ALASKA Stone tablets with probable figurine engravings, sometimes very abstract, have been found elsewhere in Alaska. Other localities are sites associated with Ipiutak culture (Larsen and Rainey 1948 and Giddings and Bandi 1952; Fig. 10 J.), Hooper Bay (Oswalt 1951; Fig. 1), Prince William Sound (de Laguna 1956:201 ff.), Yakutat Bay (de Laguna n.d.; Plate 3 e, e'), a site near Angoon on Admiralty Island (de Laguna 1960: 122 ff. and Fig. 15), and Chaluka mound on Umnak Island (University of Wisconsin 1962 field work; mostly not figurines). Most of these have much in the way of medium, size, faintness of incising, re- striction to one end of the stone, unit composition in which the stone may form the body, frequent poor and disorganized execution of design, and some- times specific elements. Only the single Yakutat specimen and one from Chaluka resemble the Kodiak facial designs, and at that they fall far short of identity. Furthermore, it is assumed that the Yakutat face is incomplete. The Y figure in 4 Palugvik tablets (de Laguna 1956; Fig. 28-29, 31-32) may</page><page sequence="6">Clark: Incised Figurine Tablets from Kodiak correspond to the nose and orbital arches of the Kodiak tablets, and the layout of these specimens is suggestive of the Kodiak engravings. Until the Kodiak sites are better dated, the writer feels that it would be unwise to postulate a scheme of rela- tionships with other Alaskan engraved stones. DISTRIBUTION AND DATING The distribution of an artifact may reflect the distribution of exploration. This is not so with in- cised figurines. In terms of the number of archae- ological specimens collected, the best represented portions of the historic Koniag Eskimo area are the Uyak site and Chirikof Island, both with nil or neg- ligible figurine yield. Absence of figurines in the Chirikof collection may be biased by the fact that slate is not common on that island and most slate that was recovered was sandblasted. Hrdlicka's excavation methods may lead us to question his recovery of only two specimens at the Uyak site. Considering, however, that several persons were involved in that excavation, which yielded thousands of artifacts, and that some excavators did recover two specimens, we may conclude that incised fig- urines were rare at the Uyak site. Ninety-five per- cent of the incised tablets came from the slightly known area about Kodiak City, including Afognak Bay. At Rolling Bay, a late site, slate is not avail- able in the immediate vicinity so the practice could have been transferred to a different medium, but this limitation does not hold for Kiavak site 418. There is some possibility that the pottery-bearing component of Kiavak 419, which did yield a few in- cised figurines, is older than site 418. It is inter- esting to note in this connection that the 3 Rolling Bay specimens came from an older part of that site, and that the quantity of tablets decreased in the upper part of the Monashka and Kizhuyak Bay sites. No pre-pottery Koniag site has been tested on the southern half of Kodiak, hence my earlier statement that all appropriate horizons have been sampled may be in error. The Koniag phase may date from 1000 to 1200 A.D. and there is a distinct possibility of undiscovered early pre-pottery Koniag sites in the present southern, pottery-using, Koniag area. At Monashka Bay the figurine-yielding component should be early Koniag. The same situation may apply to the Upper Level of the Uyak site. On Kodiak, incised tablets have a distribution centering about Kodiak town where they are ex- ceedingly abundant, especially early in the Koniag phase, and away from this center they are uniformly uncommon. However, elimination of certain largely undetermined hiatuses in exploration may alter this distribution. 123 STONES WITH GEOMETRIC DESIGNS Two slate beach pebbles without context from Monashka Bay are covered with intersecting vertical and horizontal lines. Also at Monashka Bay we found a broken pebble with a spoked octagon design (Fig. 3 J.), a stone slab measuring 7.5 by 35.5 cm bearing large incised chevrons, and a pebble with a roughly incised oval, all from the upper component. USE OF ENGRAVED STONES Use of engraved stones, but not the actual eth- nographic specimens, is reported in salvage ethnog- raphy from the northern Northwest Coast where Indian informants suggested that they were skin rubbing or scratching stones (de Laguna 1961:123). The writer is reluctant to apply this explanation to the Koniag Eskimo tablets on the basis of this meager evidence, and Dr. de Laguna evidently has reservations about accepting it as the only explanation for the incised stones. "The incised tablets were presumably amu- lets, although we will probably never know just how they were used" {Ibid: 128). Some prehistoric Koniags produced relatively great numbers of engraved slates in a wide size range. Most of them were made without care, prob- ably in haste or at least with the expenditure of little time. Although a few specimens are works of art, most of them could have been made in less than a minute, only a few seconds being required for the simplest. The designs are difficult to see and pos- sibly were not made to be seen. Likewise little care was used in selecting the blank tablet. Similar compositions do not appear as decorations on utili- tarian or art objects. They are anthropomorphic. Archaeological evidence suggests a limited temporal range at each locality. Large numbers were dis- carded in small areas, probably at the same time, and several of these may have been the work of one person. The writer considers it unlikely that they were talismans since the tablets usually were very numerous, poorly made, show no evidence of attach- ment, and evidently were frequently discarded. From this evidence it appears that a group or segment of the population may have made and dis- carded or deliberately cast out the marked pebbles as a ritual observance. A body of lore and probably other actions would have accompanied the figurine act. According to one of my fellow students, Father William J. Loyens, who is well read in shamanism, likenesses to Siberian shamans' special garments can be seen in other engravings in addition to the abstract design previously cited. Historically, how- ever, Eskimo shamans did not have special garments, and I doubt if we can with any degree of certainty tie these pieces to shamanism.</page><page sequence="7">124 This explanation hardly accounts for the weak- ness of the trait over most of Kodiak. Possibly a less intense ritual may have become hyper-devel- oped in part of its area, or a few practitioners of figurine ritual may have visited or moved to non- figurine-making areas. Hyper-development actually could have stemmed from usage as ritual skin rub- bing stones and their lower density at most sites could reflect the normal level of usage, but there is no way to be certain of this. THE ART The figurine art is contingent upon the fact that humans and often their dress and ornaments are portrayed. For this reason it is not surprising that elsewhere we find figurine art that resembles the Kodiak tablets to varying degrees. Excepting a few motifs, spurred, dashed, and ladder lines, nothing resembling the figurine art is known in the Koniag home art, which as far as ar- chaeological specimens go, is practically non- existent. Petroglyph faces at Cape Alitak (Heizer 1947) (Fig. 8 e_ here) and Afognak Island (Fig. 8 d) and a few rock paintings of the Chugach Eskimo (de Laguna 1956; Fig. 22 A, 23 A, and possibly 22 C) resemble the figurine faces. Heizer justifiably used the figurine evidence to suggest that the Alitak petroglyphs were made by the Koniags (1947:288), however, the treatment given the face in the Alitak petroglyphs and the figurines is not without roots in earlier periods in southwestern Alaska. Similar faces are seen on stone lamps from the Alaska Peninsula and Kachemak Bay (Cressman and Dumond 1962; Plate II, Z\ de Laguna 1934; Plate 69; Marsh 1956:1 13 ff.). The style of portraying the face on these lamps, in petroglyphs, and on incised fig- urines differs considerably from an Ipiutak style face on a lamp from the north shore of Bristol Bay (Larsen 1950; Fig. 57 1) and faces from the Ipiutak site at Point Hope (Larsen and Rainey 1948; Fig. 28, 29). Nothing from the more extensive Uyak Lower Levels "pre-Koniag" art resembles the figurine com- positions although a few of the clothing motifs are found on toggle harpoon heads (Heizer 1956; Fig. 38 _i, 39 £) and the ladder motif was found on a bone tube (ibid; Plate 80 J.). The previously cited stone lamps should cross-date with the Uyak Lower Levels. Little in the way of Kodiak figurine art can be seen in the Aleutian Islands or to the east among the Chugach Eskimo although tree lines and sche- matic faces are common in Aleut art (1962 Univer- sity of Wisconsin collections; Jean Aigner, personal communication) . Among the more northerly Eskimo of western Alaska we fail to find the Kodiak figurine art in the Arctic Anthropology 2y 1 modern Eskimo pictographic and zoomorphic art. Petrof (1884; Plate IV) figures a Togiagamute grave post with designs slightly suggestive of the Kodiak figurines. The practice of ornamenting utilitarian objects in the more ancient Okvik and Old Bering Sea cultures (here lumped although several periods and styles of Okvik and Old Bering Sea art have been recognized) and Ipiutak culture biases our study towards these cultures of nearly 2000 years ago. Two dimensional figurine art is poorly represented, but for Okvik-Old Bering Sea we find clothing repre- sented on three dimensional figurines in much the same manner as it is portrayed on the Kodiak tablets (Oswalt 1957; Fig. 1 3; Rainey 1941; Fig. 27, Fig. 30; Rudenko 1961; Plate 4 1). In art of the same cultures we also find tree or ramiform lines, various spurred lines including use of triangular spurs, alternating dashed and continuous lines, double lines, and organi- zation of decoration into panels and bands, all of which are characteristic of Kodiak incised figurines. Many Okvik and Old Bering Sea objects decorated in what has the appearance of the skeleton motif, es- pecially the ribs and spinal column, are suggestive of two abstract engravings from Monashka Bay (Rainey 1941; Fig. 4, 21 .3 &amp; ¿j Geist and Rainey 1936; Fig. 26; Rudenko 1961; Plate 29 2^ &amp; 38 JJ3). The writer would hasten to point out, however, that a great deal of Old Bering Sea art, especially the curvilinear and nucleated eye attributes, is not represented in the Kodiak designs, and that which Old Bering Sea art and the clothed Koniag figurines have in common is to a large degree found in later art of the Bering Strait region too. To a lesser degree, the same remarks apply to Ipiutak art although "clothed" figurines apparently were absent at the Point Hope Site. Schematic faces on decorated antler tubes (Larsen and Rainey 1948; Fig. 28, 29) differ considerably from incised faces on the Kodiak tablets , yet the two are not entirely disparate. Larsen and Rainey suggest a relation- ship to the Kodiak petroglyphs which no doubt they would have seen in the incised figurines too if they had been known then. Ipiutak art employs the skele- ton motif (ibid; Fig. 31, Plate 52 6_, p. 125 ff., &amp; elsewhere). We may conclude, operating on the level of in- dividual art motifs, that one of the art traditions which has pervaded the cultures of western Alaska, north and south of Bering Strait for nearly 2,000 years also extended south to the Gulf of Alaska, to the territory of the Koniag Eskimo. In making this postulate, it is desirable to allow multiple art tradi- tions in part involving differences in media and function in western Alaska, and place in these other traditions the etched pictographic art (ivory incis- ing), painted pictographic art and woodworking of various parts of western Alaska. The treatment of the face in the Kodiak figurines and petroglyphs may</page><page sequence="8">Clark: Incised Figurine Tablets from Kodiak fall outside of these traditions, but it has Asiatic and Northwest Coast parallels (Heizer 1952; 1956: 52) as well as considerable local time depth and could even be a local independent copying of basic anatomical features. Collins has seen in the art of southwestern Alaska, especially the Eskimo from Norton Sound to Bristol Bay, a blend of Punuk and Ipiutak Styles, and he has also seen prehistoric origins for some of the art motifs of more northerly Eskimos (1961: col. 21). In my estimation the Kodiak figurine art agrees with and extends these findings. A possible factor in the art history of Kodiak is the postulated second millennium A.D. migration from the Bering Sea region to Kodiak Island (Lantis 1947:118; Cressman and Dumond 1962:36). The in- cised figurines may come in on Kodiak about this time, and if it could be shown that there were no antecedents to the figurine art on Kodiak they could be taken as evidence in favor of migration. The few antecedents already known, however, may obviate so simple a proposition. The individual motifs are very simple and widespread, and it is possible that correspondences on the motif level noted above are due only to a rather indirect relationship. Beside being objects of interest per se, the in- cised figurines are potentially highly useful markers for working out the history of an area with complex cultural affiliations.
