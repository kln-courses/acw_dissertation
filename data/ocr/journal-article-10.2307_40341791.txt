Religious affiliation is truly regarded a very private affair and a matter of personal choice. Religious activity is free from state intervention unless civil and criminal laws are grossly violated by a heavy-handed and unusual reli- gious exercise (e.g. restricting personal freedom, use of narcotics, violence towards members of the organisation, etc.). And vice versa, public norms, values, and ideals have been taken from the religious sphere and vested in civil, secular enterprise. Religion has to compete with other social institutions and enterprises (i.e. government, state, sports, secular education, political parties, market place, lobbies, and special interest groups) for influence on an equal footing. The political arena is dominated by secular ideology. If some politicians are pri- vately influenced by religion it is not immediately obvious.2 The exceptions are two small Christian fundamentalist parties which are, however, not represented in parlia- ment and are not often heard in public discourse. Vying for seats in parliament after having constituted themselves publically, they could not muster a mandate, not even after Mixed-Member-Proportional-Representation (after the German electoral and parliamentary model) was introduced, giving smaller parties a better chance.3 Religious views though, represented infrequently in TV and radio talk-shows, are considered of minority interest only and are aired only when they concern a popular and controversial issue. This happened, for instance, when, in 1998, the leader of the Christian fundamentalist party coalition took objection to the public display of a tra- ditional-type Maori carving showing an anthropomorphic figure clutching his penis. A resume of the paper was given at the 4th Conference of the European Society for Oceanists, Leiden 25-27 June 1999. My thanks to Robert Davis for his help with punctuation. 1 This is a vital difference which has been pointed out, among others, by Luckmann (1967), Stark and Bainbridge (1985) and Hale (1980). 2 Politicians who became known to incline towards Christian fundamentalism reduced their chances of re-election. 3 A minimum of 5 % of votes cast is required to gain a seat in parliament.</page><page sequence="2">232 Erich Kolig When he arrived in the small country town to cover the private parts of the wooden figure with a traditional Maori flax cloak, he was ridiculed by Whites (pakeha) and driven out of town by Maori incensed at his cultural insensitivity. The media presenta- tion of this event was, by and large, not sympathetic towards this man's designs. Virgin in a Condom Given this general state of affairs, it was all the more surprising when shockwaves of cries of blasphemy reverberated through the nation earlier in 1998. The new national museum of the country, Te Papa, in Wellington, which had barely opened its doors to the public, displayed a small statue of the Virgin Mary covered by a condom. This exhibit, made from a commercially available statuette of seven cm height, and entitled "Virgin in a Condom", was by English artist Tania Kovats. It was part of a travelling exhibition of British art work, "Pictura Britannica", which had toured the world and had raised some eyebrows before.4 Another piece in this exhibition which displeased was a replica after Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper" in which the place of Jesus was taken by a bare-breasted woman. However, the greatest fury of hurt religious senti- ments was directed at the Madonna clad in a condom. The archetypal mother-figure, representing purity and unblemished femininity, one of the most powerful symbols in the wide range of Catholic iconography, had, through the ail-too close association with a contraceptive device, been seriously defiled in the eyes of devout Catholics. Protestations by the artist, herself a (former) Catholic, that her intention was not to blaspheme but to prompt serious thought about issues such as sexuality, contracep- tion, abortion, and sexual politics (Kovats 1998:1), were drowned out by the chorus of incensed Catholics. Not only Catholics were unanimous in their condemnation. Support for their view came also from some Christian (Protestant) fundamentalists and even Muslims.5 Discussions on radio and popular TV programmes on the subject failed to pacify or mediate between the antinomious positions of religious reverence on the one side and the advocates of free speech and art in a secular society on the other. A member of par- liament threatened to invoke the law to get the offending object banned. As the news- paper reported his views: The exhibit "[...] is an indecent object exhibited in a place to which the public have access. This is a crime under Section 124 of the Crimes Act [...]" and "[...] Section 123 Blasphemous Libel" (Dominion 1998a:4). However, in the end no serious litigation ensued as, presumably, this would not have had popular sup- port. In fact this piece had to be excluded from display at some locations - in the U.K. and in Australia - because of strong sentiment against its public display. 5 The Virgin Mary has a special place in the Koran. Sura 19 - Surat Mariyam - bears her name.</page><page sequence="3">OF CONDOMS, BICULTURALISM, AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 233 Views pro and contra made headlines in the media for weeks. Arthur Skinner of "Catholic Action" stated: "We are outraged at what is going on. Our Holy Mother, the mother of our saviour, has a condom over her head. May the Lord have mercy" (Sunday Star Times 1998a: 1). And another cleric, a Father Michael Anderson, was quoted as saying: "I would hate to think what Jesus Christ would think of people who put a condom over the head of his mother [...]. This is the day of Satan and his demon- ic angel. This is the day which has been prophesised" (Sunday Star Times 1998a:l). A petition was signed by 28.000 people to remove the exhibit from display. TV, radio programmes, and chat shows, with an eye on ratings, focussed their attention on this issue. Visitor numbers to the museum increased sharply. People came specifically to look at this piece either to be offended or to relish the furore. Several physical attacks on the exhibit and museum personnel were carried out,6 demonstrations and prayer meetings were held in front of the museum and in the foyer involving waving placards, speech making, and singing hymns. On the more sinister side, death and bomb threats were made, specifically against the museum's chief exec- utive who was named a target. Counter-demonstrations were staged ridiculing the Catholic position and exhorting the museum administration to stand fast. It would certainly be pertinent to analyse the religious mindscape in relation to its iconography and the power of symbols in social discourse. Doing so would shed some considerable light on this episode and the root causes for the strong emotions which were stirred up. It certainly was the all-too-sharp juxtaposition of the sacred with the utterly profane which sparked outraged cries of blasphemy and sacrilege. However, such an analysis is not my purpose here. Also, it is not my purpose to discuss the function of art in Western society: whether or not the arts as an elite, minority cul- ture are entitled to violate norms of good taste and ethical standards of the wider soci- ety. There is a powerful argument, which was in fact invoked in the case of the Madonna with condom, that the intrinsic vital function of the arts is not to please, but to make people think, and that this is achieved best by dredging up areas of discom- fort, by annoying and hurting, by transgressing on socially defined boundaries of good taste and manners, and by not respecting social sensitivities. What is of interest here in this essay is to enquire into the reasons why this is only selectively brought to bear in New Zealand society. The exhibition was originally not intended to be shown at the Te Papa Museum, but was to be displayed at the Wellington City Art Gallery. The gallery, however, was to be renovated and the museum agreed to host the exhibition instead. It could be argued that a museum audience is different from art gallery visitors and that this dif- ference is important: a display in an art gallery for art connoisseurs provides quite a different context in which the artist's intention would have been better appreciated. A museum display is accessed by the wider public and should be more attuned to socially 6 The art piece had to be placed under protection by a special guard.</page><page sequence="4">234 Erich Kolig extant views shared more widely beyond an elite group. This opinion was put forward, if not exactly in such words, by a columnist in the "Evening Post" (Crampton 1998:7). In his view, implicitly, the whole controversy would not have arisen had it not been for a faulty executive decision. But, these differences aside, both art gallery and museum represent expressions of current ideology.7 The affair raises the question whether a secular society in fact should have regard for religious sentiments of any kind. As the editor of the "Evening Post", a daily paper, wrote: "New Zealand is not a theocracy such as Iran, where religious orthodoxy is forcibly imposed [...]. It is a secular, pluralistic society which recognises and accom- modates a range of lifestyles and philosophies" (Evening Post 1998b:5). What the col- umnist wanted to say was that a secular society is entitled to ignore religious feelings in general; in other words, a secular society is a society in which one 'philosophy' can offend another one with impunity. However, another daily paper, the "Dominion", took the opposite view and argued the "museum got it wrong" in being so insensitive to a group of New Zealanders (Dominion 1998b:3).8 In this incident, Catholics were incensed that their sensitivities could be so gross- ly violated in a society which prides itself on its cultural tolerance and guaranteed free- dom of religious worship. "The New Zealand Catholic" addressed this vital issue in the following way: "The [Catholic] protesters [at Te Papa] were depicted as nut cases with rosary beads, but leaders of the Maori cultural renaissance are valiant figures. When it comes to respect for culture, there are undoubtedly double standards firmly in place" (New Zealand Catholic 1998:8). A letter to the editor of the "Dominion" conveyed similar thoughts: "I wonder how a Tiki [traditional Maori icon] in a condom would be interpreted and viewed by the same people", adding rather humourously: "The real tragedy of the Madonna in a Condom, of course, is that the artist's father didn't use one" (Dominion 1998c:8). The Christian Coalition party leader, a Reverend G. Capill, was quoted as saying that the museum's attitude is disappointing in the extreme and that [...] when it comes to Maori spiritual values, great care is taken to avoid offence and main- tain protocol. In particular, it is acceptable to Te Papa to allow Maori to say prayers and follow other religious rites according to their custom. Sadly, Te Papa does not extend the same courtesy to the Christian faith, despite it also being foundational to New Zealand's way of life. If Maori had been offended by an exhibit, within hours the staff would have addressed the problem. When Christians are offended by an exhibit which attacks a cen- tral figure to their faith, security is increased, and vows of seeing the exhibition out are affirmed (Dominion 1998d:l, 3). National Party MP John Banks had this to say in a similar vein: "They wouldn't wrap a Maori taonga [cultural treasure] in a condom or the gracious Maori Queen in a con- 7 See, for instance, Bennett (1995) and Vergo (1989). Characteristically Te Papa's other sobriquet is "Our Place" and people were wondering - as evi- denced in letters to the editors of newspapers - whose place it was.</page><page sequence="5">OF CONDOMS, BICULTURALISM, AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 235 dom and get away with it and neither should they" (Sunday Star Times 1998b:5). In other words, what Catholics - and to some extent also other Christians - seemed to resent above all else, was that by comparison with another group's interests they seemed unfairly treated. Maori spirituality enjoys respect and official protection; Maori cultural sensitivities are cocooned in a warm atmosphere of universal acceptance in New Zealand society at large, while other forms of spirituality and religious tradi- tions apparently are exposed, at least potentially, to the harsh winds of criticism and ridicule, and have to be made of sterner stuff if they wish to survive. In particular museum culture has adapted to Maori demands, almost to the point of producing a 'syncretic' culture. For instance, when Te Papa was officially opened it involved Maori ritual and cultural protocol {tikanga Maori) to a significant extent. When "Te Maori", a travelling exhibition of outstanding Maori cultural artefacts, toured American centres between 1984 and 1986 and afterwards New Zealand, care was taken to follow Maori cultural traditions in setting up and presenting the display in the various locations. An entourage of Maori representatives, experts {tohungd) and elders (kautnatua), accompanied the exhibition to perform the appropriate rituals and to instruct museum personnel in the culturally proper and spiritually acceptable han- dling of the material. Another museum matter of great importance to Maori concerns the moko mokai (smoked and preserved Maori heads) which had been an item of 19th century curio collecting in New Zealand and can now be found in many museums and private collections. They have been removed from public display in all New Zealand museums and are now either being handed back to the respective tribal authority (iwi) or kept in special, sanctified (tapu) storage vaults to which only tribal kaumatua have access. Catholics and others were quick to point out that while of them it was demand- ed that they silently tolerate a museum's abuse of one of the cornerstones of their creed, Maori sensitivities would never be allowed to be harmed in this way. A curator of the Waikato Museum of Arts characteristically remarked that art work critical of Maori culture would be displayed only if it was done by a Maori artist. This remark was occasioned by the cancellation, at the last minute, of an exhibition by a well known pakeha artist, Dick Frizzell, due to protests by the Tainui iwi (Dominion 1998e:6). To put this into perspective it is important to have a few basic figures: Catholics number about 500.000 in New Zealand society (whereby their degree of commitment to the faith remains by and large unclear). This amounts to approximately 13.3 % of the total population, which is just slightly less than the number of people convention- ally identified as Maori. Maori constitute 14.5 % of the total population (Statistics New Zealand 1998, based on 1996 census). If one defines the majority mainstream pakeha society vaguely as secularised, liberal Protestant, then both Catholics and Maori con- stitute significant minority communities of roughly equal size.9 9 The Catholic community derives from mainly two sources: an earlier Irish immigration which became</page><page sequence="6">236 Erich Kolig The shockwaves of the Te Papa controversy revealed some interesting ideologi- cal faultlines in this society: religious attitudes and secularisation (or religious irrever- ence), biculturalism (the official New Zealand policy recognising Maori 'traditional' culture; see below) and Maori cultural renaissance, freedom of critique and political correctness. This Gordian knot cannot be cut with a bold strike of a verbal sword, but only solved with a cautious deconstruction. The linchpin in this matter, I would assert, is biculturalism, as perceived now, which places Maori traditions in a privileged posi- tion above multi-culturalism and equal rights for all citizens, and posits exceptions to the otherwise neutral stance of a highly secularised society vis-a-vis overt religious commitment of any kind. Cultural Renaissance and Biculturalism For about the last twenty years there has occurred a powerful resurgence of Maori identity in New Zealand, a process usually referred to as the Maori cultural renais- sance. Outward phenomena of this process are an increasing interest by persons of Maori descent to emphasise their Maori origin {whakapapa), genealogy and ancestry {mokopuna)y to identify as Maori, to speak the language (if in most cases only as a sec- ond one), and to participate in tribal affairs. The Maori renaissance, by and large, can be seen to comprise two major initiatives. One which is distinctly political demands political and economic concessions based on the official recognition of a special posi- tion of the original inhabitants {tangata whenua or takata whenud) who had entered into a contractual arrangement with the later arrived British settlers by way of the Waitangi Treaty. This allows now Maori to derive major economic benefits through so- called Waitangi Treaty settlements awarded in compensation for breaches of the Treaty.10 The other is an insistence on cultural distinctiveness (maoritanga) and the preservation of a cultural identity distinctly different from all other ethnic groups who have arrived later. The latter aspect relies on the conscious formulation of cultural tra- ditions and on a process of objectification of culture. This process involves aspects not only of deliberate maintenance of existing cultural forms, but also of revival of cultur- al forms which had been on the verge of becoming extinct, and to some extent it also involves elements of innovation and invention as appears to be usual in such cases.11 Such latter traditions may have the flavour and style of Maori culture, but have been formed recently.12 part of the dominant pakehal anglo-celtic culture, and a more recent immigration from predominant- ly southern Europe. Catholic Maori were also incensed at Te Papa's display (see, for example, Sunday Star Times 1998c:3). In this paper I shall not address this issue. 11 See Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) and Hanson (1989). Of course the distinction of what does constitute recent innovation or invention and what does not</page><page sequence="7">OF CONDOMS, BICULTURALISM, AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 237 Closely linked with the Maori renaissance is the issue of biculturalism. The con- cept was introduced into the socio-political discourse in New Zealand for the first time by the anthropologist E. Schwimmer, in a volume entitled "The Maori People in the Nineteen Sixties" (1968). Schwimmer, in proposing the concept as a political impera- tive to be followed in New Zealand, saw it as integrally referring to social inclusion of equal rights and equal opportunities for people of Maori extraction, in a legal and political sense (see Sissons 1995:61-62). The debate has moved on since then and questions of equal rights are focused now on the issue of Maori sovereignty. The more common usage of biculturalism nowadays, however, is a more narrow one referring to official recognition of Maori cultural values and skills (such as language, protocol, spir- ituality, arts, crafts, oral literature, etc.) and their incorporation into the official politi- cal discourse. Occasionally there have been attempts to replace the label biculturalism with that of multi-cultural and multi-ethnic society in recognition of the fact that New Zealand society is composed of several groups of quite diverse cultural, linguistic, and religious backgrounds, and that there has been a sizeable recent immigration of non-British, non-European and non-Western groups. Apart from Maori and the dominant Anglo- Celtic component, there are significant minorities of Chinese origin going back to the nineteenth century, there are Dutch, Balkanese, Lebanese, Polynesian islanders, Indian, and in very recent years immigrant groups and asylum seekers from Asia (Indian, Hongkong Chinese, Taiwanese, mainland Chinese, Middle Eastern, etc.) and Africa.13 Maori have successfully resisted the more wide-spread adoption of the label multi-culturalism, fearing as they do that it would detract from their status as tangata whenua, the original inhabitants of the land, and that they would become submerged in a view that Maoriness is no more than just another ingredient in a multitudinous eth- nic mix. Such a view would be difficult to reconcile, they suspect, with their demand is highly contestable. It also depends on the view of whether culture is a fairly stable entity or whether it 'naturally' is perpetually changing and malleable. Depending on this view many of today's traditions either will be accorded continuity with early post-contact and pre-contact traditions or, alternatively, will be seen as discontinuous, inauthentic, and as contemporary inventions. However, it is not the purpose of this paper to consider this intriguing issue in any detail. - The term 'invention' also may entail some difficulties insofar as it may have quite different semantic connotations. It may connote pretence and inauthenticity (in the sense Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983 predominantly seem to have used the term); or it may signal the sense of a creative and ingenious construction (as Hanson 1989 apparently intended the term to mean, although this was not so understood by several of his detrac- tors who took offence). Other connotations may refer to the presence or absence of 'sincere inten- tion', honesty, opportunism, etc. However, a discussion of this concept in relation to the indigenous cultural revival would go vastly beyond the framework of this paper. 13 According to official statistics on "ethnic groups" (based on 1996 census): Eutopean/pakeha 79.6 %, Maori 14.5 %, Pacific islanders 5.6 %, Chinese 2.2 %, Indians 1.2 %. The higher than 100% sum total is the result of some people maintaining more than just one ethnic identity (Statistics New Zealand 1998).</page><page sequence="8">238 Erich Kolig for special recognition and concessions due their status. Ranginui Walker, a Maori aca- demic, expressed it quite clearly: "Biculturalism is predicated on the basis that there are tangata whenua, indigenous people of the land, and non-indigenous colonisers" (1982:62-63). This view posits an antinomious situation between Maori and all later comers, and obliquely refers to the former's privileged position as original inhabitants vis-a-vis all others. To some extent the demand for biculturalism is seen to possess a quasi legal basis in and through the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty, signed in 1840 between the British Crown and some 500 Maori chiefs14 - in the way in which it is interpreted nowadays - established a social and political partnership between equals.15 Above all, it is seen to have secured to the Maori enjoyment of land possession and natural resources and to entitle them to restitution and compensation where these rights have been violated in the past. The second major issue flowing from the Treaty is Maori sovereignty {tino rangatiratanga). A bitter debate today carried out within this framework of a quasi legal interpretation of the Treaty, concerns the question of whether Maori sovereignty had de jure remained intact or was surrendered to the Crown; and if it had been retained by the Maori how should this be translated into actual political reality nowadays.16 The Treaty's current validity, as perceived today, can only rest to some consider- able extent on a decontextualisation. That is to say, when it was proffered by the Crown to the Maori, it was in all probability not seriously intended to be honoured by future generations or to be of lasting legal consequence beyond the Crown's monopo- lised right to obtain land from the Maori owners. Ideas, prominent at the time, about the impending disappearance of the Maori, both as a race and as a culture, in the course of "natural selection", would have militated against the Crown earnestly pon- dering consequences in the more distant future. In fact, the issue of the current legal- ity of the Treaty itself has not been totally resolved in a constitutional sense. In the political culture of the country, however, it appears to be practically accepted, leading to restitutional settlements between the Crown and several tribes (iwi) in recent years. Not surprisingly, voices critical of the Treaty as a binding compact of present-day valid- ity, have been raised at various times.17 What is perhaps surprising is that a (Maori) proponent of biculturalism - which now often is based on a perception that it was legitimated through the spirit of the Treaty - also questions the Treaty's validity.18 A difficulty compounding the problem with the Treaty is that it exists in several versions, some of which are in the English and some in the Maori language (Orange 1987). A particular English language Treaty version is now accepted as the major one, By no means, however, all Maori representatives and leading personalities of the day 15 Maori definitely do not see themselves as 'junior partners'. 16 See hon. D. Graham, Minister of Treaty Affairs (1995; 1999:13). 17 See, for instance, Ross (1972), Parsonson (1988), Scott (1995, 1996), and Round (1998). Walker calls it a "document that has never been ratified or recognised as a treaty of international law" (1984:280).</page><page sequence="9">OF CONDOMS, BICULTURALISM, AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 239 but it does not refer to sovereignty {rangatiratanga) or governance (kawanatanga) in the Maori language, and instead it speaks of sovereignty which hereby is deemed to be sur- rendered by the Maori signatories to the Crown. The other major reference is to Maori proprietorial rights over land and natural resources. The major Maori language version refers to both rangatiratanga to be retained by Maori and kawanatanga to be trans- ferred to the Queen (Orange 1987:257-259). In neither version is there a reference to indigenous (or British for that matter) culture, lore {tikanga), language, spirituality, religious exercise, its perpetuation or the guaranteed coexistence of two different cul- tural traditions (Orange 1987:258-259). The Maori version of Te Tiriti o Waitangi refers to "taonga" in article two, which is simply translated by Orange as "possession" (1987:262). In the context it is clear that the term "taonga" was meant to refer to "material possessions" (and perhaps in a wider sense to "treasured natural resources") and accordingly this section of the Treaty is usually translated as "lands, settlements and possessions". Whether culture and tradi- tions can be regarded as possessions or whether this was indeed the understanding of 'culture' (as an object that can be possessed) at the time, is debatable. Now of course Maori do refer to aspects of traditional culture or cherished traditions as "taonga" and infer from this interpretation a legitimation through the Treaty for their guaranteed practice of culture, religious and spiritual traditions, and, ultimately, for biculturalism. As Levine observes, if "taonga" means "anything of value" the Treaty has unlimited applicability (1989:19). A close reading of the Treaty text does not produce any obvious or unambiguous reference to Maori cultural matters (such as, the preservation of language, traditional lore and the guaranteed exercise of their religious beliefs) and the need for their offi- cial recognition or otherwise. The three articles of the Treaty clearly refer to matters other than culture or spiritual needs and whether or not such cultural and religious principles are implied in the 'spirit' of the Treaty is a matter for debate. However, the Treaty, as interpreted nowadays, is seen to entail such 'cultural' obligations incumbent on dominant pakeha society so as to secure the survival of Maori language and culture.19 Among other things, this means for central government bod- ies, educational institutions, regional and local governmental authorities and the like that they must allow some form of Maori co-governance or input so as to lend official status to Maori culture. Many official institutions have formalised this commitment and their charters, mission statements, strategy statements and the like specifically refer to their perceived obligations. University charters also acknowledge some oblig- ations under the Treaty. And so do some pieces of legislation. The Resource Management Act of 1991, for instance, reads: Treaty of Waitangi - In achieving the purpose of this Act, all persons exercising functions 19 Biculturalism is not deemed to be contingent on the view that sovereign rights have been retained by Maori and that preservation of their culture flows from the continued exercise of sovereignty.</page><page sequence="10">240 Erich Kolig and powers under it, in relation to managing the use, development, and protection of nat- ural and physical resources, shall take into account the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) (New Zealand Government 1991, part II, section 8:22). On a practical level, official bodies and authorities now make efforts, in one way or another, to recognise - or to be seen to recognise - the relevance of Maori traditions, in various ways: for instance, by acknowledging the special, spiritually based relation- ship Maori have with the land, recognising their custodianship of land and indigenous nature, and ceding a participatory role to Maori organisations {iwi, runanga, etc.) in the decision making process concerning land, natural species, resource use - but not only that. For instance, in February 1997 the Department of Conservation has issued a Kaupapa Atawhai Strategy document which sets out in detail this institution's respon- sibility vis-a-vis Maori culture (Department of Conservation 1998). Another example of how the Waitangi Treaty is taken to entail recognition of Maori cultural and spiritual values is provided by the Otago Regional Council and its Proposed Regional Plan "Air for Otago". This plan contains a proposal on future reg- ulations relating to the maintenance of air purity in the region of Otago in southern New Zealand. It says: Section 8 of the Resource Management Act 1991 requires all people exercising functions and powers under it, in relation to managing the use, development, and protection of nat- ural and physical resources, to take into account the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Treaty guarantee of rangatiratanga to Kai Tahu [the local tribe] should be reflected in the provision of adequate and appropriate opportunities for participation in the air qual- ity planning, management and monitoring. [...] Attitudes to resource use need to be rec- onciled with the relationship between iwi and te taiao [world, country, district], mauri [life force], wairua [spirit], tapu, mana [power, prestige] and rangatiratanga. Central to an understanding of these concepts is a knowledge of the Maori holistic values and the cos- mogenic origins that make Kai Tahu part of the physical environment; they belong in it, and not, it to them. As kaitiaki [custodian, guardian] they have an inherited responsibili- ty to protect and preserve mauri and to conserve taoka [= taonga] (Otago Regional Council 1998:9). This quite clearly gives expression to the exegetical view that the obligation for recog- nition of Maori spiritual values emerges out of the legal document Waitangi Treaty. It implies the relevance of a consultative role for Maori (as kaitiaki, custodians) to advise on spiritual views relating to land, nature, and resource use.20 Of course, as far as natural resources and their use are concerned there is a more direct link with the Waitangi Treaty (in the English language version). The Treaty in "article the second" guarantees the Maori "the full exclusive and undisturbed posses- sion of their Lands and Estates Forests and Fisheries and other properties which they Note the frequent reference to Maori spiritual concepts and the absence of a translation, thus osten- sibly assuming the reader's familiarity with them in line with obligations of biculturalism.</page><page sequence="11">OF CONDOMS, BICULTURALISM, AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 241 may collectively or individually possess" (Orange 1987:258). Although overtly refer- ence is made to property rights only, one can interpret this also as an implied reference, that such possession is held in terms of Maori cultural meaning; i.e., the usufruct can be rationalised by reference to traditional Maori spiritual concepts. The Treaty of Waitangi does guarantee rights of access to valued resources in a more obvious way and this must have important implications for the management of conservation issues relating to nature, flora, and fauna. Not surprisingly, the Depart- ment of Conservation has a well defined policy regarding the customary use of indige- nous species in exercising Maori traditions. Concessions granted episodically to Maori under this aegis appear well justified against the background of the wording in the Waitangi Treaty. Sometimes Department of Conservation conservation strategies are breached to allow for the accommodation of Maori traditions.21 Beyond an aspect of biculturalism which is juridically more clearly identifiable and which is taken to underpin the official nature of some indigenous rights, there lies the realm of cultural equality not so supported. By this I mean the quasi official recog- nition of the validity and contemporary relevance of Maori culture and the demand that it be allowed to enjoy a status au par with the Anglo-Celtic cultural heritage of mainstream society. This also entails that it be privileged vis-a-vis other immigrant (minority) cultures. A small sample of cases and incidents may suffice to demonstrate how Maori cul- tural matters and traditions have gained official recognition outside more obvious Treaty obligations.22 A series of relevant conditions concern the treatment of human remains {koiwi tangatd) both in museum culture and in forensic circumstances. Preserved Maori heads, in accordance with current museum policies, have completely disappeared from public display. Even Egyptian mummies would in most New Zealand museums no longer be exhibited as a concession to Maori sensitivities. An expedition, in 1998, by the then Minister of Maori Affairs, himself a Maori, to retrieve some heads from overseas and bring them back at public expense, did though cause some rumblings of discontent and in fact invoked a censure by his party leader (part- Maori by descent) - but interestingly not from the prime minister, a pakeha. There appears to be a wide-spread drive by Maori to push for the repatriation of such pre- served heads from museums and private collections around the world. In a similar vein 21 For instance, in 1990 Chattam Island Maori were allowed to use albatross chicks for a ceremonial feast. Albatross are a highly protected species in New Zealand which must not be taken or used in any form. In this case Maori were allowed to gather chicks that had fallen from the nest (personal communication M. Ellison, Department of Conservation, Dunedin, 16/3/99.) - I thank the Depart- ment of Conservation, in particular Messrs. M. Clark and M. Ellison of the Dunedin branch, for detailed information. 22 Of course, some leading Maori as well as pakeha would claim that such recognition is entailed by the 'spirit', if not the letter', of the Treaty, as discussed below. - I do not discuss here the various con- troversies which have repeatedly erupted in recent years over the issue of 'cultural safety'. 'Cultural safety' refers to the need for teachers and nurses to be educated - and to receive formal training to that effect - in Maori cultural and spiritual matters.</page><page sequence="12">242 Erich Kolig and because of Maori sentiments about the proper treatment of human remains, coro- ners nowadays make sure that Maori corpses are speedily returned to grieving relatives and tribes for the appropriate traditional ceremonies {tangi) which must not be delayed. The treatment accorded to places considered sacred by Maori {waahi tapu) clear- ly reflects the privileged influence Maori culture and religious belief has in an other- wise highly secularised society. Such sites often are traditional burial places, mytho- logically relevant places, places of historical significance and the like (for a complete list see e.g. Matunga 1994). There are numerous instances where the presence of a sacred site influences land development, building and roading projects and the like.23 From the numerous cases I shall just briefly mention one as a fairly impressive and very recent example. In 1998, Department of Conservation scientists identified a problem with the volcanic crater at the top of Mount Ruapehu: the shape of the crater mouth allowed the build up of water which in turn acts like a cork bottling up hot gases and pressure. Reshaping the crater to allow water of the crater lake to drain away so as to relieve the pressure was recommended. This intervention would prevent the gradual build up gases and their eventual violent release in the form of a deadly debris flow (lahar) with potentially catastrophic consequences for the surrounding, heavily popu- lated area. However, because of Maori protestations that no interference with the sacred mountain was permitted, no action was taken, despite the potential dangers to life and property of thousands of people, Maori and pakeha alike. The mountain is considered a god (atua), parent of land (matua), treasure and divine ancestor (tupuna). Traditionally, Maori would not even look at the mountain out of respect. Especially the crater lake (te wai o moe) is tapu and it may not even be publically discussed.24 Whether the minister responsible for conservation matters will overrule Maori opposition remains to be seen.25 Another instance demonstrates the strength of Maori traditions in the court sys- tem. In 1998, the case of a man came before the court, who had almost fatally injured his partner by ramming a cross up her nose into her brain. The woman was Maori, the man pakeha but both lived in a Maori cultural environment. The court agreed that the man's erratic behaviour at the time was the result of makutu, a traditional Maori form of spell (black magic) which had forced the man, as in a possessive state of mind, so to act. It sentenced the man to seek treatment by a tohunga, instead of imposing a prison sentence as normally would have been the case under current New Zealand criminal law, for having inflicted grievous bodily harm.26 Only some of these places gain legal status by virtue of becoming vested in the Historical Places Trust. 24 See Department of Conservation (1998:23 -24). For information material on this case I wish to thank the Tongariro/Taupo Conservancy of the Department of Conservation. Interestingly, however, opinions on the wisdom of this sentence were divided even among leading Maori.</page><page sequence="13">OF CONDOMS, BICULTURALISM, AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 243 Nowadays, under the aegis of biculturalism, it is taken for granted that immigrant minority ethnic groups subordinate themselves not only under the dominant pakeha cultural umbrella in dealing with the wider society, but also to acknowledge the supremacy of Maori traditions in one way or another. A city of Dunedin publication on the occasion of the sesqui- centennial celebrations of "organised European settle- ment" in the region and involving representations of the various ethnic groups living in the city, had this to say: "Many participants expressed pride in representing their cultures, joy in claiming a place in Dunedin 's society, and appreciation of the takata whenua's inclusiveness in allowing them to do so" (Dunedin City Council 1998:7). And a spokesperson for the Tibetan Buddhist community is quoted as saying: "I am bask- ing in the sunshine and in the generosity of the takata whenua" (Dunedin City Council 1998:7). These utterances are clear evidence for the wide-spread acceptance of practi- cal biculturalism which concedes the status of primogeniture to the indigenous people and tacitly at least seek approval and legitimation in ethnic minority cultural activities from Maori.27 Political Correctness and Constructing a Foundation Myth Although Maori as a whole have become Christians, they have retained, or developed, as the case may be, significant cultural traditions and forms of spirituality in which they differ from mainstream, dominant pakeha society as well as from other minority cul- tures. Their brand of Christianity is in effect a strongly syncretistic one. Or to phrase it differently: Maori spirituality is composed of Christianity and to a significant extent of non-Western, essentially traditional Maori beliefs. There is a distinct religious ethos, in which a majority of Maori, regardless of whether they are Christian or not, seem to differ from non-Maori. To what extent this particular brand of syncretic Christianity can be called counter-hegemonic and compared with the South-African case material presented by the Comaroffs (Comaroff and Comaroff 1991), is open to debate and cannot be considered here. Maori traditions are undoubtedly more spiritually orientated (i.e., they incorpo- rate and draw on, to a large extent, a spiritual dimension) than mainstream pakeha tra- ditions, though Maori statistically are probably as much, or as little, devoutly Christian as pakeha. Their situation reflects the general situation in a secularised society (or more specifically, modern Western society) where organised religion is retreating in impor- tance, but religious beliefs of a more informal nature, eclectically held and discon- nected from an integrated system of beliefs (as for instance in the New Age movement) and detached from an ecclesiastical organisation, may thrive. However, in public dis- 27 See Kolig (1997) for a case of Buddhism seeking indigenous legitimation for the erection of a religious shrine.</page><page sequence="14">244 Erich Kolig course their spirituality is not considered part of the private sphere - as is done with regard to other ethnic groups' spirituality - but has come to enjoy official status. There is also another and much more conspicuous ingredient in the counter- hegemonic drive: the so-called Maori cultural renaissance as a powerful political fac- tor of recent years entailing practically motivated and interest- driven strategies of var- ious kinds (see Kolig 1998). Consequently, in response to Maori initiatives, conven- tions have developed in New Zealand society as a whole in very recent years whereby Maori traditions and resultant sensitivities are taken into account and given a quasi official status in many areas of the public discourse. The recognition of Maori cultur- al, religious, and spiritual needs of the sort described above is only partially based in New Zealand law. In most cases such recognition cannot be directly linked with the articles contained in the Waitangi Treaty and in some cases only a very indirect linkage can be established. A particular reading, however, claims that cultural recognition (i.e., recognition of Maori cultural separateness and obligations for the wider society flow- ing from it) is an integral facet of the Treaty - regardless of the fact that it is not clear- ly expressed and irrespective of whether this interpretation is linked with the issue of sovereignty or not. This facet, like several others, would be, so it is claimed, more implied than overt, as can be expected with an otherwise bland and ambiguously worded document. The practice of biculturalism is presented now as if it were supported by the Waitangi Treaty. For instance, in a critique of the justice system as failing Maori women, a commissioner of the Law Commission is reported as saying: "The Treaty of Waitangi also promised the values of the Maori [with regard to women and gender issues] would be respected" (Otago Daily Times 1999:31). Implied in this critique is, first, the notion that women were much better off in traditional Maori society than is now the case under New Zealand legislation; and second, that the Treaty would have something to say on Maori values. Biculturalism and its implications, though given status in the public discourse, to state the obvious, is by no means universally accepted in New Zealand. In fact, histor- ically seen, biculturalism in a way had been rejected by the New Zealand govern- ment before. When in 1886, King Tawhiao tried to establish a kind of home rule in the Waikato (the area claimed by the King Movement as sovereign) he cited his right to do so under section 71 of the New Zealand Constitution Act of 1852. But the claim for Maori self-government in native districts "according to their own customs and social usages" was firmly rejected by the then Prime Minister Dick Seddon (Walker 1984:271). Also today, some voices are scathing of this concept, for various reasons. The question emerges: if biculturalism transcends, stricto sensu, its legal basis, by what agency are such cultural politics, whether demanded by Maori or granted will- ingly by official authorities, legitimated? What grounding does the privileged position- ing of Maori cultural traditions in public discourse possess in New Zealand society?</page><page sequence="15">OF CONDOMS, BICULTURALISM, AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 245 My contention is that cultural politics and their implementation rely more on the agency of a sense of political correctness, extant in dominant (pakeha) society, rather than on a legal basis deriving from either the Waitangi Treaty or some successor legis- lation.28 The perception, now widely extant in official circles, that the privileged position of Maori traditions is anchored in the Waitangi Treaty, ultimately seems to have only a very loose basis in legal precedence, and is based on an interpretation - a construction as to the spirit of the Treaty rather than its letter - derived from a sense of what is fair, reasonable, and ethical, i.e. 'political correctness'. This notion does not exist in a con- cisely formulated, official, and codified form, yet pervades the political culture of this nation. Political correctness is not just a philosophical problem (see Friedman and Nar- veson 1995) which needs to be discussed as to its veracity and the epistemic validity of its current contents, but as a real factor of ideology in its widest sense, viz. including practical action. It is a perspective with regard to a particular issue or problem which is contingent on certain ethical assumptions and consequently enables the holder to occupy the moral high ground (i.e. derive a feeling of moral rectitude from it), and thus provides added momentum to its application. It is not tied to particular contents (of feminism, a literary point of view, or certain speech figures, or even to fashionable issues within the domain of the humanities). It can assume any content. Although a fre- quent concept of everyday usage, political correctness is not a conventional concept of the sociological discourse. As a populist label it often has a humorous connotation and implies friendly, or sometimes not so friendly, derision; in referring to a set of canoni- cal ideas which have a ring of fashionableness, it perhaps contains, cynically put, more than just a hint of hypocrisy. The formulation of Maori 'tradition' and 'culture' is based on an objectification (Sissons 1993) and an implicit "interestedness" (Kolig 1998). As I have argued in an earlier paper, a major factor was the more liberalised, 'enabling' political climate which made certain developments possible. Maori have of course to some extent been able to influence the formation and content of the 'politically correct', for instance, through various forms of 'activism' (see Walker 1984) - but not totally so. The rise and acceptance of biculturalism by the dominant society is carried by differ- ent agencies. Biculturalism in its present form has been achieved in the main not through Maori pressure, but through a responsiveness of the dominant society to Maori griev- ances. For Williams, the cause lies in a combination of the reassertion of Maori cul- 28 Such successor legislations were: The Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, which set up the Waitangi Tribunal; The Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 1985, which made the previous act retro-active to 1840 thus vastly increasing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; The Maori Language Act 1987 and oth- ers, such as the Resource Management Act 1991, containing only indirect references to obligations under the Waitangi Treaty.</page><page sequence="16">246 Erich Kolig ture29 and a labour government, elected into office in 1984 and willing to listen to new economic and ideological realities: By the end of the 1980s the policy of racial integration had given way to the notion that New Zealand was founded on the basis of an agreement between two peoples and that this involved an ongoing partnership. New Zealand by 1990 was officially, and to some extent in practice, a bicultural society (Williams 1996:13). But when the government in 1988 declared the Treaty to be part of the basic law in New Zealand, the profession of biculturalism went hand in hand with creating "an economic climate that savagely disadvantaged Maori people" (Williams 1996:13). This is not surprising. Political correctness is the self-cleansing mechanism of hegemony, a palliative of conscience, the practical arm of self- righteousness. Practical- ly, it means conforming with meaning-makers and opinion-manufacturers who enjoy popular currency at the moment. Its content and direction are very ephemeral. In a pluralistic and democratic form of society such as exists in New Zealand, there is at any time a plethora of opinions and views, ethical points of view and the like abroad. This fact should neither surprise nor overwhelm. The interesting question is why, in this multitudinous mix, do some meaning-makers and some opinions rise to prominence and, what is more, to social dominance, while others fail? What are the processes steer- ing the selection of some meanings, what are the circumstances increasing the attrac- tion of some views and favouring their coming to prominence? Williams, in identifying the roots, says rather cynically that it is "advantageous [...] fashioning an acceptable national self-image in a world where colonialism and racism are bad for business" (1996:12). This recognition was the result of an econom- ic crisis brought on by the entry of Britain into the European Community in 1973, followed by loss of the major market to the New Zealand economy and the subsequent desperate search for new markets, many of them in developing countries. Beyond the roots of biculturalism and of the ideology which supports it, as they were identified by Williams, there are others which have certainly contributed in crea- ting an ideological 'climate' of which Maori culture is now the major beneficiary. The culture of Post-Modernism and its epistemic and ethical associates must bear consid- erable responsibility. Anti-colonialism has spawned the kind of subjectivism which sig- nifies inter-cultural equality and respect (Gellner 1992:26). Post-colonial guilt feelings are also playing a vital role in informing the relationship of the West with so-called third and fourth world societies. Add to this fashionable New Age values such as a new admiration for traditional, or 'tribal', knowledge30 and respect for 'tribal', or tradi- tional, cultures which are romantically admired now as healthier, sounder, environ- mentally friendlier, and truer to human nature than modern Western culture. Maori authors and artists promulgated the worth of traditional culture since the 1970s. This admiration stems from epistemic insecurity, excessive relativism and anti-scientism (see Gellner 1992).</page><page sequence="17">OF CONDOMS, BICULTURALISM, AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 247 The meaning of the Treaty is obviously not monolithic, allowing for shifting inter- pretations which in the past heavily depended on economic circumstances (van Meijl 1994). In fact, for a considerable length of time, the Treaty was considered a legal nul- lity and Maori appealed for its recognition in vain. Political correctness has changed the situation dramatically, emphasising the existence of a cryptic "spirit" hidden in the Treaty wording. "The spirit of the Treaty transcends the sum total of its component written words and puts narrow or literal interpretations out of place", says a Waitangi Tribunal report of 1983. 31 In order to tease out this spirit in fact a never-ending search in the form of an elaborate narrative has been set in motion resembling in nature an evolutionary process towards an imaginary, teleological goal. In a report and discussion paper of the Conservation Authority it says: Many scholars and commentators, both Maori and non-Maori, have developed our under- standing of the Treaty over the years. The work and findings of the Waitangi Tribunal and the courts have contributed to a growing body of interpretation and guidance for people and official agencies dealing with the Treaty and its application in the modern world (New Zealand Conservation Authority/Te Pou Atawhai Taiao o Aotearoa 1997a:39). The Summary paper expresses this notion even more clearly by speaking of an evolu- tionary process in the understanding of the Treaty's spirit: "Our understanding of the Treaty is continually evolving as judgements of the courts and the Waitangi Tribunal consolidate and clarify the principles through addressing specific cases". (New Zealand Conservation Authority/Te Pou Atawhai Taiao o Aotearoa 1997b:7). This quite properly states that there is a process of elaboration on the basic mytheme of an original compact between settlers and indigenes. Through the gradual construction of an ever more complex narrative which draws on a range of subtle implications from romantic shadings of the Noble Savage to the seemingly hard fact of current legality, what is interpreted now to have been the original intention and spirit of this contrac- tual agreement is, by and by, being brought into ever clearer focus. We observe in New Zealand the construction of a meta-tradition in the form of a narrative being weaved around the nature of the Waitangi Treaty, partly by way of stated government policies, official and Maori intent, but partly also through a vague consensus based on a notion of what is ethically and politically correct. The narrative emerges on the basis of "constructing a Treaty rhetoric" whose mystifying and ob- scuring effect is part of the creative process (Levine 1989). This perpetually emergent 'tradition' shows all the ambiguity of other cultural traditions, making it difficult to decide clearly whether this is an invention or a modification of an existing one.32 A decision whether it is one or the other rests entirely on an exegesis of the nature and spirit of the Treaty - rather than of its letter or its history of acceptance. The current 31 Waitangi Tribunal report 1983:55, quoted by Levine (1989:18). 32 See, for example, Feinberg (1995), and Thomas (1992).</page><page sequence="18">248 Erich Kolig interpretation clearly seeks to underline the authenticity of the tradition of bicultural- ism. In this process, the construction of the relevant narrative - the Great New Zealand Foundation Myth - has the vital task of bridging, if not fudging, irreconcil- able oppositions and founding 'culture' and the pursuit of tradition in law which in a way privileges the religious and cultural sensitivities of a minority community and runs counter to the spirit of a secular society.33 Thus, the function of this meta-myth, on reflection, is more than just justifying concessions to the indigenous minority. The comparison with the Catholic case reveals a much greater reach of consequences in the application of the agency of political cor- rectness. Biculturalism, in its aims, is more than just "tinkering with existing institu- tions to include a Maori perspective" (Williams 1996). It has to reconcile two irrecon- cilable traditions: those of a secular society which is inclined towards disregarding reli- gious values and ideas with the very spiritual nature of the traditions of a politically privileged minority group. Such a reconciliation of incompatibles is only possible through the preponderance of a particular form of political correctness. In order to help obfuscate the irreconcilable difficulty a unitary narrative has in effect been creat- ed and is being built upon in ever more sinuous complexity - a founding myth about the Great Waitangi Treaty, a mythical contract which laid down the law, fair and benef- icent. It holds that it is only for want of proper application in the past that true union and partnership of cultures has not been achieved. This narrative has shaped an ideo- logical framework in which the words of the historian Parsonson, describing the Treaty as "a document cobbled together by rank amateurs" (1988:21), sound like treason. 33 A few voices have tried to counteract this narrative. Notably Webster has been critical of maoritanga and of the post-modernist rhetoric of biculturalism which conceals the realia of Maori existence. He argues the state has its own discrete interest to promote the appearance of the Maori renaissance, rather than make an attempt to give it substance. His critical stance is based on the view that this renaissance is an elite driven, deliberate strategy, supported for reasons of convenience by the state and further condoned by the post-modernist meaning-based view of society (Webster 1989, 1993 a, 1993b, 1998).
