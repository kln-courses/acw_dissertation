ENGBERG (Palestine, Transjordan, Syria, and Cyprus) WALDO H. DUBBERSTEIN (Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and the U.S.S.R.) with the assistance of B. C. BRUNDAGE, I. J. GELB, C. F. NIMS, A. VON R. SAUER, and A. D. TUSHINGHAM EGYPT AND NUBIA Alexandria. Alexandria Graeco-Roman Museum Excavations made in a search for the royal quarter of the Ptolemaic era have brought to light on the jetty of Silsileh part of a Greek wall about 10 meters long and 1 meter wide. It is believed to extend to the sea and to be Ptolemaic. The foundations of an Arab tower in which fragments of Greek architecture had been used were also found. Egyptian Gazette, March 5, 1938. (Athar en-Nabi). Department of Antiquities In 1929 Mahmud Hamza examined a block of stone reported here and found it to be a kneeling statue of Merneptah I holding a naos within which was the figure of the hawk-headed Re-Horus. He believes this site to be that of ancient Khery-cAh.a and the House of the Ennead mentioned in the Piankhi stele. Annales du Service des Antiquit's, XXXVII, Fasc. 3 (1937), 233 ff. Cairo.

L'Institut Frangais d'Archologie Orientale and University of Warsaw During work from January to March, 1938, three crude-brick rectangular mastabas were uncovered in the Old Kingdom necropolis. The burial cham- bers were either dug to a slight depth or built of bricks and preceded by a vaulted passageway. One contained a large stone sarcophagus which had been pillaged, an alabaster plate, and much pottery of the usual type. Two large jars inverted over heaps of dismembered bones were discovered in the vicinity of the mastabas. The pottery shows that these are not prehistoric burials, hence they must point to a curious survival of an ancient custom. Middle Kingdom burials lay about the mastabas, the superstructures of 319</page><page sequence="2">320 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES which sometimes served as supports for them. The majority of these tombs consisted of low-vaulted chambers of brick. The bodies, buried with jewelry consisting of collars of hematite, amethyst, and carnelian, and with alabaster and pottery vessels, were sometimes placed upon earth benches and variably oriented. The absence of sarcophagi and the presence of curious terra cotta figurines characterized this group. Another cemetery largely of the Second Intermediate Period lay south of the preceding around a ruined mastaba. Some of the tombs were subter- ranean, while others consisted of large vaulted chambers above ground. The pottery forms, the funerary furnishings, and the constant use of rectangular wooden sarcophagi readily distinguished them from older burials. The bodies were laid on beds of reeds in the coffins and were very irregularly oriented. The discovery of several Middle Kingdom alabaster vases within one of the mastabas suggests that later burials had been made there. The Ptolemaic houses cleared on the top of the mound were well dated by a fragment of a Greek papyrus of the end of the second century B.c. and by numerous demotic ostraca. Decorated pottery of new forms and bronze ob- jects from a workshop were also found in these houses. The Roman village (first to second century A.D.) produced, among other monuments, a vast portico adorned with architectural elements and with columns deriving from ancient edifices. The columns were engaged in crude- brick walls bounding a series of rooms which opened on a central court. Doubtless this represents a market place surrounded by shops. The remains of a passageway flanked by a stairway which descended to vaulted caves were discovered in the upper layer of rubbish to the west on the summit of the mound. They are dated by Coptic objects and inscribed sherds to the end of the sixth or beginning of the seventh century A.D. Cer- tain Greek ostraca bearing religious texts and lists of deacons were found in the rubbish. The edifice appears to have been part of a Coptic convent. About 150 demotic, 50 Coptic, 90 Greek, and 2 Latin ostraca and some fragmentary Ptolemaic papyri were found in the Greco-Roman area. From a report submitted by the Director, K. Michalowski. See B.

Department of Antiquities Ahmed Fakhry has been assigned the task of exploring the ancient remains of El-Bahlariyah and El-Farifrah oases. Though he visited other sites to ascertain the extent of the ancient areas, his work the first season was largely confined to the villages of El-Qa?r and Bawiti in El-Ba.tariyah oasis. He cleared three temples of Ahmose II's reign and discovered three other temples and several tombs. The scenes and inscriptions of the three Ahmose temples were carefully done and well preserved. The doors of one had been filled with stones and mud in the Roman period. Within it were found a statue of Bast covered with inscriptions, one of Thoth with the head covered with gold, and part of a small column on each side of which was carved the head of Hathor. All were of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. The well-preserved scenes and inscrip- tions of another of the temples present many important religious scenes, notably the resurrection of Osiris. A fourth temple in the midst of El-Qagr dates to the reign of Apries. The remains of an important temple were discovered in Bawiti as well as the lower parts of two inscribed alabaster statues from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty.

Department of Antiquities Further clearance of the galleries under the Step Pyramid has been ac- complished. Work of clearance and restoration was also done on the mastaba of Ka-irer, the tomb chamber of which was uncovered. It contained an empty limestone sarcophagus and a black-schist offering-table. The walls of the chamber were covered with poorly inscribed offering-lists. The mastabas</page><page sequence="4">322 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES of Sa-mery, Ny-kau-Ptah, Isesy-mery, and a fourth adjoining the latter were cleared. The funerary temple of the pyramid of Unis was also partially cleared, and some of the bas-reliefs originally found by Barsanti but later lost were found again. Annales du Service des Antiquites, XXXVII, Fasc. 2 (1937), 103 ff. During the gathering of stone for the reconstruction of the mastabas (see above), several fragments of an inscription of Khamuas, son of Ramses II, were found. The inscription parallels those known from the Maqtabat el- Farac6n, the sun temple at Abfi Gurab, and the pyramid of Sahure. Other parts of the inscription were found in place on the south face of the pyramid of Unis. It is the most complete of the four parallels.

During this season a number of fragments were replaced in the North Princess Building of the Step Pyramid complex, and restorations made so that three of the papyrus columns now stand to their full height. Similar work was done on the facade of the South Princess Building, restoring a portion of the structure on each side of the door and the row of hkr-ornaments above the door. A cast of the statue of Zoser was placed in the serdab, and many frag- ments were replaced and reconstructions made in the entrance colonnade.

Egypt Exploration Society Work at Sesebi was completed in February, 1938, under the direction of H. W. Fairman. In the southeastern section of the town under two medieval tombs was found a large house built after the reign of Seti I. Below it was another, apparently of the Nineteenth Dynasty. Beneath all was a large, brick-lined construction like a well which may have been a prison or a series of store chambers. Intact foundation deposits at the southeast corner of the town wall and under the temple in the center of the city proved that Amen- hotep IV founded town and temple. Clearing of the center and western sec- tions of the town and study of the brick-lined trench discovered last season were completed. The expedition then moved to the new concession at cAmdra. Examination of the ancient site of CAmara West showed it to be a large mound buried deep in sand. The town appears to have largely escaped modern robbing, and the houses are well preserved. The temple walls, inscribed inside and outside, stand 6 or 7 feet high. Historical inscriptions of Ramses II, Merneptah, Ramses VI, and Ramses IX were found. One of two large steles of Ramses II, though incomplete, bears thirty-two lines and makes reference to the marriage of the king and the daughter of the king of Hatti.</page><page sequence="5">THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGICAL REPORT 323 Evidence of an occupation of the site not later than the Eighteenth Dynasty was found.

Department of Antiquities Tewfik Boulos reports that at the first of these two sites near Abydos were found three shaft tombs containing multiple burials with fragments of wooden coffins and pottery. They seem to date to the New Kingdom. There were also found eleven tombs, some being pits and others consisting of shaft and chambers. These latter consisted of two tombs, one of the husband and the other of the wife, close together. In one case, however, the burials were of a woman and a child. Two more plundered tombs similar to the first three completed the finds. At ed-Deir further tombs were discovered, some being mere pits in the sand while others consisted of shaft and chambers. They had been disturbed in modern times and yielded little besides pottery. Annales du Service des Antiquitls, XXXVII, Fasc. 3 (1937), 243 ff. Thebes (Deir el-Medineh).

A plinth of the earliest period, with molded profile, is comparable in its masonry to that of the Herodian inclosure to the Haram of Abraham at Hebron. Clearances made near the first tower to the west of Herod's Gate have shown that the wall at one time stood some meters in front of its present position. Here, too, the lowest course is com- posed of masonry of Herodian type. Glueck in AJA, XLII, No. 1 (January-March, 1938), 169; see also Lt. Col. N. P.

Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and L'Ecole Biblique Peres De Vaux and Savignac made a rapid exploration of this region in March, 1937. Their principal aim was to find traces of ancient constructions and to recover the Nabataean and Lihyanite inscriptions mentioned by Musil in his Arabia Petraea, II Edom, 11, p. 157, but never published. The Wady el-cAin was explored to its source. At Tell el-Qedeirat, sherds of the eighth to tenth centuries B.C. were found, as well as some that may belong to Iron I. Tombs of various periods were found in the wady as well as an ancient tower. Thamudian and Nabataean graffiti were noted. At Khirbet Umm Heitat the ruins of a large villa were found. The pottery from this site was Roman, Iron I, and Iron II. Khirbet el-Abayyad was dated to the Roman and Byzan- tine periods, while Khirbet Umm Zeituneh was in existence as an important place from the sixth century B.c. through the third century A.D. Two Tha- mudian inscriptions were found north of cAin Qadesh, as well as one in Cufic in which the beginning of the profession of faith is clearly legible. In all, eleven inscriptions were found. The expedition found much evidence that trade routes had passed through this area for centuries. De Vaux and Savignac, RB, January, 1938, pp. 89-100.

Ezion-geber (Tell el-Kheleifeh). American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem Excavations carried out during the spring of 1938 under the direction of Nelson Glueck indicate that this site had a far greater importance than ac- corded it in the Old Testament. Of several periods represented, that of the time of Solomon seems clearly to have been the most important. Ezion- geber's population occupied its time with three main trades: (1) the smelting of copper; (2) the manufacture of copper implements, particularly spearheads, fishhooks, nails, fibulae, etc.; and (3) sea trade, shipbuilding, and fishing. The copper came from the vicinity, and possibly also from the Arabah where it had been crudely smelted (see AASOR, Vol. XV). Of forty-five rooms thus far opened, one-third, all in a block, was devoted entirely to smelting and re- fining copper. This block as it stands is the most extensive and intact smelt- ing center known from the ancient Near East. Large, heavy pottery crucibles stood in most of the rooms, and all chambers were connected by an intricate flue system built in or through the walls. It is thought that the ore to be smelted was placed in the crucibles around which charcoal was stacked and that the entire smelting plant was fired at the same time.

Government of Lebanon In 1937 Dunand found that the temple of the obelisks had been built upon an older temple apparently constructed about 3000 B.C. and used continuously until destroyed by fire about 2250 B.C. Five construction stages were noted in the temple of the obelisks, the first dating to the Middle Kingdom, the last to the time of Ramses II. The obelisks were found only in the first four stages.</page><page sequence="10">328 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES One from the third stage bears the name of "King Abishemu," not the same, however, as the well-known king of the time of Amenemhet IV. During demolition of the temple a number of interesting objects were found in the walls and in the earth courtyard. Among these may be noted nine ornamented ceremonial fenestrated axes of heavy gold. Gilgamesh and Enkidu(?) are represented on one of the axe handles, while on the blade are scenes of wor- ship of a Mesopotamian character. Near the south edge of the plateau an- other sanctuary of about the time of the Middle Kingdom was found. Pottery deposits elsewhere suggest relationships with the fourth tomb at Mycenae, the first palace at Knossus, and with First Dynasty tombs at Abydos.

Yale University and Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres Since the 1936-37 campaign was to be the last, for the time being at least, an effort was made to complete unfinished areas. Only in the Hellenistic Agora, in the temple of Atargatis, and in a few chamber and tower tombs was new work begun. An important part of the season's work was a better under- standing of the size, nature, and importance of the Hellenistic city. The earlier Hellenistic palace of the Citadel had been replaced by a second struc- ture which was Parthian in plan, having great iwans as at Hatra.

Hamath (Hama). Ny Carlsberg Foundation During the 1937 campaign conducted by Ingholt, thirteen tombs of the Roman period were discovered. In the Aramean city destroyed by Sargon a number of important discoveries were made. A ramp led down from a large building to the imposing entrance to the citadel. On this ramp the expedi- tion found several basalt sculptures including a complete lion, a head of a larger lion, an offering-table, and a throne. On each side of the throne was a winged sphinx, and on its back two stylized lions. Several bricks found on the ramp were engraved with Aramaic graffiti giving names of persons or places, for instance, I.anan or Hamat. There was also an inscription which reads: "Adam(n)l-ram, governor of the king's house."

A large sec- tion of the city was exposed, one building containing a room which alone measured 10 by 30 meters. This building was surrounded by other spacious</page><page sequence="12">330 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES houses, all of them served by a well-developed drainage system. Five intact tombs dated to the time of the Hyksos and the collapse of the first Hittite Empire were also discovered. Tablets continued to make their appearance, one being addressed by a seer to the queen of Ugarit. Other discoveries of importance were a bronze axe covered with gold, but with an iron blade, dated about 1500 B.C., and two statues of deities in bronze from the beginning of the second millennium B.C. done in an art tradition previously unknown in Syria. The expedition also investigated the summit of Jebel Aqrd (Mount Casius) and found what may be a pre-Greek place of sacrifice. At the same site the ruins of the abbey of St. Barlaam were excavated and found to be built on the foundations of an earlier pagan temple. Glueck in AJA, XLII, No. 1 (January-March, 1938), 173.

In Section A detailed investigation of foundation</page><page sequence="13">THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGICAL REPORT 331 walls continued in the 3-meter level. "Drab" ware or monochrome brown associated with the final phase of the Bronze Age continued to appear. This season's work has made possible a better classification of the latest phase of the painted pottery found below the 3-meter level. Relationships with central Anatolian ware as well as North Syrian motifs have been established. At a depth of 61 meters more extensive building remains were uncovered. This level with the one immediately below marks the "floruit" of the painted wares. Numerous decorated spindle whorls were found. Another important building level was reached at 7 1meters with unbaked brick and pounded mud construction sometimes with stone foundations and heavy roof supports. Food-storage chambers and household equip nent were found. From a storage pit came a polished stone macehead and a bronze spearhead or dagger. Monochrome bowls as well as pottery with painted designs appear. Below 7? meters exploratory work indicated further levels of occupation with in- creasing amount of handmade wares. Among the few seals and bullae from Section A is an important representa- tion of a god identical with the chief god of Yazili Kaya. Other seals show connections with Hittite art. Seals or bullae were not found below 6? meters, but in their place were found clay stamps with simple linear patterns. To the four ovens reported in 1936 were added four more, used in pottery manu- facture. An enormous quantity of broken pottery of Cypriote Iron Age was found in connection with the ovens. In the field south of the hill an exploratory trench begun in 1936 was exca- vated to water level at 71 meters and continued to more than 8 meters. At nearly 6 meters' depth two burials were located in the northern half of the trench. Further work nearer the hill revealed two jar burials and three direct- ly in the earth. These burials are mostly those of young children. Pottery was found with the burials. The cemetery seems to be not later than the Early Bronze Age. Investigation in Section B was also resumed this season. Despite many intrusive pits between 14 and 19 meters, it was possible to establish building levels. An apsidal building in fragmentary condition at about 16 meters may be dated to the early eighth or ninth century. Later leveling and filling has caused considerable damage and confusion. In the large building found here last year there is certainly a room with mangers or troughs for feeding animals. A room to the north of the manger-room, possibly used as a stable, opens on a street or court. Interesting architectural details have been found in this section but relatively few small objects. Most of the pottery found was "drab" ware, with a few painted sherds showing relationship with Bogazk6y. New excavation in Section B, cutting through from the surface, uncovered Turkish graves and then immediately Islamic remains which in turn tele- scoped with Roman materials. A carefully constructed Roman well was noted. Hellenistic building remains again showed interesting and unusual architectural details.</page><page sequence="14">332 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES A circuit wall of large stones along the southern side of Section B was damaged by World War trenches. An inner wall of smaller stones was over- laid with pounded mud and clay. A western widening of Section B encoun- tered the same main strata as on the eastern side.

University of Pennsylvania and American School of Oriental Re- search in Bagdad Under the direction of Pierre Delougaz work continued from December, 1937, to March, 1938, at mounds A and B. On Mound A work was resumed in the area of the Small Shrine and the Sin Temple. Fine examples of the Diyala, or Scarlet Ware, as well as the earlier Jemdet Nasr ware, with typical small finds, were recovered. In another part of the mound a sculptured head and part of a plaque were found. In levels of the latest phase of the Early Dynastic period elaborate vaulted tombs of plano-convex brick construction were uncovered. All tombs had been thoroughly rifled. Further work in the cemetery is planned. The most important find this season from Mound B is an inscribed clay cylinder recording the building of the fortress Dur-Samsu- iluna, by Samsuiluna. This cylinder confirms the identity of Mound B with this fortress, an identity suggested by fragments found in previous seasons (cf. AJSL, LII [1935/36], 210).

Gaming pieces, anthropomorphic in shape, were also found in this level. Under the Northern Temple of Level XIII, a well, probably sunk from Level XIV, yielded pottery fragments with numerous seal impressions in geometric design with repre- sentations of animals. During the spring campaign, 1938, excavation in Level XVIII yielded important transitional pottery between the Halaf and 'Ubaid periods, as well as a round house (tholos) of a type found at Arpa- chiyah.

North Caucasus According to a recent survey the oldest excavated gold objects from this region are the ornaments and vessels, now in the Hermitage Museum, found in 1897 in a tumulus near Maikop (Koban region) dated to the latter part of the third millennium B.C. Fourteen sites excavated between 1869 and 1907 yielded gold objects from the third and second millenniums B.C. All except one northern site are located within the Maikop region. Toward the end of the second millennium B.C. gold disappears in North Caucasian burials. It has not been found in contemporaneous or earlier sites farther east. The North Caucasian Bronze Age, dated to the end of the second and the beginning of the first millennium B.C., is represented by many sites of Koban culture in North Ossetia and generally in the mountainous regions of the North Cau- casus. With the exception of a very few gold spiral rings from Ossetia, gold objects were not found at Koban culture sites. The "Scythian epoch" (last six or seven centuries B.C.) is very rich in gold.</page><page sequence="16">334 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Finds from the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. are concentrated in three areas: (1) Cimmerian Bosporus (Kerch and Taman Peninsula), (2) Malkop region (approximately identical with the earlier area of gold finds), and (3) near Nicopolis on the Dnieper River. The first and third regions, representing the center of Greek colonization and the political center of Scythia, are of little interest. The second area, falling within the Koban region, is more representative of native uses of gold. Most authors are inclined to consider Scythian gold as having been imported from the Urals or the Altai Mountains, though A. Berthier-Delagard believes it came from the Mediterranean. Gold objects from Scythian sites of the period (Kelermess, Ulskaia, Kostromskaia, etc.) fall into three groups: (1) of western Asiatic origin (tentatively identifiable as of Haldic provenience), (2) of distinctly Greek origin (less numerous; most probably from Ionian settle- ments on the west coast of the Euxine), and (3) of native, Scythian origin (characterized by prevalence of animal subjects and by distinctive style). This last group has little representation in the more northerly Scythian sites of the Ukraine and in regions to the east. Consequently, the Belaia River Valley in the Maikop region again appears as a probable auriferous region. Chemical analyses of objects in groups 1 and 3 (no samples from group 2) showed traces of platinum and arsenic in "Scythian" as against "Haldic" objects. In the later Scythian period (fifth to second century B.c.), gold objects are even more common. The finds from this period come from two areas, the Taman Peninsula and the Malkop region. Disregarding the former territory, occupied by populous Greek colonies, we find in the latter seven major sites of tumulus burials, all yielding gold objects, excavated between 1875 and 1917. Western Asiatic objects are lacking in the finds of this period. Greek- made objects, many obviously manufactured for local consumption, pre- dominate. Many finds in the small group representing native craftsmanship come from the eastern North Caucasus, where contemporary objects of Greek origin have not been excavated. Of particular interest here is a thirty-five- pound treasure of gold objects found in Kazinskaia village in 1910. To the same period belong finds from Ossetia. Available evidence points to a Greek sphere of influence as well as to a native, Scythian territory in which gold objects may have been made from local, North Caucasian gold. The two subsequent periods of North Caucasian archeology, the so-called Sarmatian (second century B.C. to fourth century A.D.) and the Alanic (fifth to eighth centuries A.D.), are also rich in gold objects. During the Sarmatian period two types of gold objects, one local and the other influenced by the Bosporian (Greek) traditions of Kerch and Taman, are still discernible. During the Alanic period, characterized by political and ethnological changes, the local style begins to predominate, and the gold objects acquire a homo-</page><page sequence="17">THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGICAL REPORT 335 geneous character. The Hellenistic objects of the Sarmatian era are the first to penetrate-during the first centuries of the Christian era-the easterly regions, particularly Baksan and Chegem. Gold objects of the local style of the Sarmatian period are found in the northern part of the Koban area, particularly at Zubovskif Khutor on the Koban River and near Novocherkassk, but none as yet from the mountain- ous area of the region. Animal motifs usually characterize the objects of local manufacture, which differ greatly from the local style objects of preceding epochs but resemble contemporaneous gold objects from the Volga region and western Siberia. As yet a northeastern origin for these objects in the North Caucasus may not be assumed. A golden vessel with a Greek inscrip- tion found near Migulinskaia on the Don indicates that some of these gold objects were produced under the influence of the Greek Black Sea colonies. The geographical distribution of the finds of the Alanic period places them in the mountainous and the piedmont regions of the North Caucasus, from the Taman Peninsula into Ossetia. A few finds farther north, near Stavropol, will not change the general picture unless other evidence appears. To this period belong the finds near Dzhiginskoe (Michaelsfeld), Zdviz- henskaia near Manych, near Chegem (Kudinetovo), and a series in mountain- ous Ossetia, especially the burials of Kamunta, Kumbulta, Rutkha, etc. The profusion of gold objects from this period in Ossetia, formerly poor in gold, is of particular interest. Archeological and literary evidence seem to indicate that local gold-mining began here around 500 A.D. At the same time gold becomes rare in the Koban Valley sites. In subsequent periods silver replaces gold as the jewelers' favorite medium in the Caucasus. The only exception is the time of the Mongol invasions (fourteenth to fifteenth century). To this period are dated many gold objects found in burial grounds in Belovechenskaia (1896) and at other sites. The gold of this period is explainable by widespread commercial relations rather than by the utilization of local gold deposits. Transcaucasus The center of local gold-working from the beginning of the first millennium B.c. is in Svanetia, Lechkhum, and probably farther east. This region, men- tioned by Strabo, Appianus, and Pliny, is probably the land of the Golden Fleece of Greek mythology. Archeological and toponymical studies also point to this as a gold-mining region. The evidence on the ancient finding of gold near Sukhum is not clear. Another auriferous region of antiquity, near Chorokh, is now outside the boundaries of the U.S.S.R. Toponymical evi- dence, however, suggests that it extends into the Adzharistan area of the U.S.S.R. There is some evidence that gold was also obtained in Akstafa, in the Kazakh region, during the first centuries of the Christian Era. This is also</page><page sequence="18">336 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES borne out by toponymical evidence from Armenia. Finds of gold in Azer- baidzhan, dated in the first centuries of our era, suggest importation from Iran rather than local production. A. N. Zograf divides the classical coins found in the Caucasus into eight groups: (1) most ancient gold and electron coins (3 coins: 1 stater of Samos, 2 Cyzicene staters [Asia Minor]), (2) gold staters of Panticapaeum (5 known pieces; fourth century B.C., mostly from Taman Peninsula), (3) gold staters of Cimmerian Bosporus (6 known pieces; third to first century B.C., mostly from Taman Peninsula), (4) gold and electron staters of Cimmerian Bosporus under Roman domination (8 known pieces; end of first century B.C. to third century A.D., from Taman), (5) gold staters with profiles of Alexander and Lysimachus and imitations issued in Byzantium which became standard trade currency in the Black Sea region from the third to the beginning of the first century B.C., (6) imitations of staters of Alexander and Lysimachus, un- like previous ones, usually found in the interior of the Caucasus, and, accord- ing to Zograf, coined in the Caucasus, (7) Roman coins (6 pieces, mostly from Georgia), and (8) spurious and unclassifiable (on the basis of descrip- tion). Eastern Kazakhstan and Altai Region M. P. Griaznov reports gold objects in eastern Kazakstan burials of the Andronovo culture (beginning or middle of first millennium B.C.). Relatively more Scytho-Sarmatian objects (fourth to first century B.C.) were excavated. The ancient gold mines of the area were located in the Kokchetav and KolbinQo gold-bearing regions, though vestiges of ancient gold-mining opera- tions were found in several other localities, on Lake Balkhash, Ters-Airyk, Kaldzhir, Kurchum, and Bukhtarma rivers, etc. From the types of copper and bronze implements and pottery associated with them, it may be con- cluded that these mines were worked from the Andronovo epoch until the first centuries A.D. Ancient mining was carried out both in areas of auriferous sands and in rock formations with gold veins. Many typologically Andronovo sites containing gold objects were found at considerable distances from cur- rently known deposits. The settled character of population and the absence of intercommunal barter during the period seem to indicate that many ancient gold-bearing sites are still undiscovered.
