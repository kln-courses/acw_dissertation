Despite the increasing recognition of the Record as a source, however, guides to the nature and content of Hong Mai's massive compilation are rare, especially in English.1 Inglis seeks to fill this gap with a study of the text and its historical context, a task at which he partly succeeds. For a social historian like me, the strength of Inglis's study is the constella tion of insights into the Record that he generates as a specialist in literary texts. The Record has been customarily slotted into the category of anomaly accounts, or zhiguai (志'陸)• Inglis does not wholly disagree with this categorization, but he builds on the work of Robert Ford Campany and others to argue that the zhiguai tradition from which the Record stems is far more related to the genre of history—construed as the factual reporting of what people actually experienced and believed—than to fiction. For while zhiguai writing focuses on "paranor mal" dreams, omens, gods, and ghosts, it is exactly the existence of such strange or anomalous phenomena and their intrusion into the mundane realm that the majority of Song folk believed in (pp. ix-x). Thus the central achievement of Ing liss book is to demonstrate how Hong Mai combined the historians concern for factual reliability with an insatiable obsession with tales of the strange. Hong Mai came from a distinguished Boyang (Jiangxi) family. His father, Hong Hao 白告，1088-1155), was sent as ambassador to the Jurchen Jin in 1129, where he was detained for the next fourteen years, and his brother Gua (or Kuo, 适，1117-1184), served as chief councilor for a short time in 1166. In the first of his five chapters, "The Author and His Collection," Inglis employs tales from the Record to illustrate the centrality of gods, ghosts, and prognostications to the Hong family, while demonstrating just how thoroughly Hongs own life was given over to the compilation of his Record from the 1140s until shortly before his death in 1202. As an accomplished scholar and scion of an official family, Hong was in and out of office until his formal retirement in 1196, at the age of seventy-four. But he spent much of that time working on his anthology, which ultimately comprised three full series of ten installments each, plus a fourth, incomplete series of two installments.2 In terms of sheer biographical information, Inglis does not super sede the short notice by Chang Fu-jui, among the more accessible sources,3 but he puts the Record at the center of Hong Mais life, portraying Hong一unlike his</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 471 politically more accomplished brother Gua—as far more devoted to collecting and recording anomalous accounts than to pursuing a civil service career. The depth of Hongs obsession with collecting and recording is revealed in the extant prefaces to the successive installments, whose analysis comprises the major portion of chapter 2, "Authorial Voice and Textual Reception.” Hong wrote pref aces for thirty-one of his thirty-two installments, whose dates of completion Inglis tabulates on pages 21-22. Thirteen of the original prefaces, starting with the second installment of 1166, are extant, and another seventeen are summarized in the note book (biji 筆記)collection Bintui lu (賓退錄)by the late Song literatus Zhao Yushi (趙與時，1175-1231). Inglis gives annotated translations of all thirty original and reconstructed prefaces, which together document Hongs views about the nature and significance of his work, while providing invaluable information about "literary and textual criticism, the purported historical veracity of the collection, publication details, facets of the authors personal life, genre-related issues, and so on" (p. 23). When presented chronologically and in toto, as Inglis does, the prefaces expose the tensions generated by Hong Mais sometimes conflicting passions for the strange, for factual accuracy, and for the act of collecting itself. Potential incompat ibilities between the strange and the accurate emerge as early as the preface to the Yizhi collection of 1166. There Hong writes that "due to my interest in the extraordi nary and veneration of the strange," people from far and wide send "[me] all man ner of strange and uncanny stories found throughout the world.’’ But unlike earlier collections of strange tales, whose content is allegorical, "[m]y book. •. however has utilized both my eyes and ears—and the stories within are all based on factual sources" (p. 24). In short, as Inglis highlights and Hong stresses in the preface to the Dingzhi collection of 1180, despite his devotion to zhiguai anomaly tales, he thinks of himself as no less an historian than was Simâ Qian in the Shiji (pp. 31-32). More over, mindful of the inaccuracies that can plague a collection built up "entirely from tales passed on" by others, in the Zhiding zhi preface of 1196 Hong declares that he had checked a sample of stories to verify their accuracy, making a note beneath those anecdotes that appeared controversial (pp. 40-41). But Hongs dedication to accuracy is bedeviled by his compulsion to collect. In his last surviving preface, to the Sanzhiji of 1198, Hong writes that "Whenever â story of a poem comes to my attention, I always record it一there is no end to it” (p. 50). So he is especially peeved when tardiness or circumstance prevents him from recording a tale before it is lost to him. Indeed, as early as the Bingzhi preface of 1171, Hong was forced to admit that his collectors zeal exacerbated misstatements by his informants to introduce inaccuracies into his compilation. As a result he was deeply ashamed and "wished to desist. However, having become intoxicated by habit, I cannot stop despite myself" (p. 28). As Inglis points out, from this point on Hong Mai begins to cite precursor texts with greater frequency, and even re-edits the second installment in order to correct errors of fact (p. 29). But in the end,</page><page sequence="3">472 China Review International: Vol. 14, No. 2, Fall 2007 Hong concedes that inaccuracies are "the curse of loving the strange. I would wish the reader to simply enjoy [the anecdotes] and not be over-critical” (p. 41). Beyond documenting Hongs efforts to reconcile his competing passions, the prefaces also constitute Hongs response to his readership. In the Zhijia preface of 1194, for example, Hong challenges unnamed critics who charge him with pirat ing existing texts: "Some have suspected my recordings of having similar parts to those before me. There have even been busybodies who have gone so far as accus ing me of stealing in order to fuel my stories. This is incorrect" (p. 36). In fact, not long after this comment, the literary critic Chen Zhensun (陳振？系，1183-?) made exactly this allegation, charging Hong with "indiscriminately taking old stories from the Extensive Records" (the Taipingguangji 太平廣言己 of 978)，sometimes without alteration, in order to fill out his book (pp. 51, 58). As Inglis notes, the question of borrowing raises important issues for histori ans, for tales drawn or adapted from earlier literary sources cannot be unproblem atically used as evidence for Song culture and society. And so he accepts Hongs challenge directly, by scanning the entire Yijian corpus for antecedents from prior literary sources. The evidence, as tabulated in appendix 1 (pp. 187-194), is ambigu ous. Inglis identifies a total of 101 tales (by my count)4 taken from previous works, eighty-nine of which are cited by Hong Mai himself. Although Inglis deems this to be "a significant proportion of Hongs stories”（p. 37), if we estimate the total number of surviving anecdotes at around 2,700 then the borrowed tales amount to a modest 3.75 percent. This does not seem particularly high, especially given what Inglis identifies as the common Song (and Yuan) practice of appropriating existing stories. Still, the perception of plagiarism clearly bothered Hong and his contem poraries, and Inglis plausibly speculates that these concerns reflect a change in expectations induced by a shift to a storytelling culture that is primarily text-based rather than oral (p. 151)，though without pursuing the question in any depth. The twenty-two pages and 165 footnotes that Inglis devotes to his study of the prefaces constitute the strongest part of his book and lay out the themes he develops in his last two chapters. In chapter 5, "Questions of ‘Reliability’ and Transmission," Inglis revisits the question of factuality from the perspective of personae, spatio-temporal settings, and the Record's resonance with Song and pre cursor texts. In Ingliss view, Hong scores well on all counts: despite a few wrong dates, Hongs informants, protagonists, and places and sites can be identified in other Song sources (pp. 125-127); versions of his anecdotes that occur in parallel Song texts support the Record, suggesting that some of the tales used by Hong circulated orally before undergoing various forms of textification, while giving evidence of Hong s accuracy as a recorder of near-contemporary tales (p. 137). Finally, despite the inclusion of at least 101 tales drawn from precursor texts, "For the most part, Hong was a reasonably reliable recorder of events, and his attempts to verify what he intimated to be the factuality of his accounts certainly went beyond previous authors of zhiguai or unofficial history" (p. 151).</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 473 In chapter 4, "Genre," Inglis follows up on Hong Mais own efforts to label his work with a relatively technical discussion of the categories of anomaly lit erature (zhiguai) and unofficial history (baiguan xiaoshuo 稗官’』、說).Although Hong himself implicitly categorized the Record as unofficial history (p. 105), it is more popularly associated with anomaly literature. Inglis glosses the term guai as "the disorderly intrusion of little-known, unpredictable, and potentially danger ous entities which incorporate both objects as well as spirits (both animistic and anthropomorphic) into the everyday world of the living" (p. 117). While many of the Record's anecdotes exhibit such characteristics, many others include consid erable biographical information and have nothing to do with anomalies. Given Hongs penchant for verifying information and his attempts to achieve what he himself referred to as historical reliability, Inglis deems the rubric of zhiguai too confining for a work that shares so many of the characteristics (following a typol ogy established by Charles Gardner) of "unofficial history." As Inglis concludes, to label the work as exclusively zhiguai would close "other possible generic affilia tions—particularly that of unofficial history一and would perhaps lead readers to overlook the works subtlety" (p. 121). By "the work's subtlety," Inglis means his own notion—really his idée fixe— that loyalist, anti-Jurchen, patriotic themes "are so overwhelmingly strong in the Record that they suggest an alternative ontological purpose: that is, the Record as a work of anti-Jurchen, patriotic literature which may well have influenced the hearts and minds of its readership against the pacifist policies of the Southern Song court" (p. 121). Inglis develops this idea of the Record as a coded paean of "loyalty to the Song state" in chapter 3 ("Themes"), by far the most problematic chapter of his book. Inglis says little that is surprising or original about the two other themes he sees as fundamental to understanging the Record_retribution and destiny—and it is really the question of "loyalist voices" that most provokes him: ‘‘[T]he Records strong anti-Jurchen theme has been all but ignored by most scholars. Yet numer ous accounts contain some degree of anti-Jurchen import, even if as subtle as an anomalous event framed within a military atrocity, or else an oblique reference to the caitiffs' (/w虜)，that is, the Jurchen" (p. 94). His argument for the centrality of loyalism and anti-Jurchen sentiment to Hongs own sense of mission is largely circumstantial and can be summarized as follows. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, we can assume that Hong was sympathetic to the war faction: his father had been associated with the original war faction following the fall of North China in 1127, and on his return from Jurchen captivity in 1143, he was soon ban ished from the capital by the principal advocate of peace with the Jin, chief coun cilor Qin Gui (1090-1155); Hong Mai himself had bridled against the demeaning wording of diplomatic documents during his service as ambassador to the Jin in 1162, and Hong and his brother Gua were closely associated with such anti Jurchen figures as Lu You (1125-1209), Xin Qiji (1140-1207), and Fan Chengda</page><page sequence="5">474 China Review International: Vol. 14, No. 2, Fall 2007 (1126-1193)，"strongly suggesting that the Hongs were receptive to such senti ments" (p. 96). Therefore, we can also conclude that the many (though nowhere numbered) resistance and atrocity accounts in the Record "not only documented war crimes committed by Jurchen troops, but also acted to shame court officials for their pacifism by comparison to less influential members of society" (p. 102). This train of reasoning swells to a crescendo in the books postscript, where Inglis concludes that "the strong nationalistic sentiment woven into the very fabric of the text marks the Record apart from works of earlier or later periods" (p. 154). Ingliss assertion that the Record embodies Hong Mais loyalist call to arms runs up against the fact that Hong himself never mentions loyalism in his prefaces： "Although an overwhelming number of accounts (again never toted up) reflect loyalist views, Hong never articulated loyalist sentiment or anti-Jurchen opinions in any of his thirty-one prefaces." Yet, as Inglis stresses, Hong was "certainly vocal regarding his love of the strange, his methodology, and attempts to achieve histori cal accuracy. This paradox could not have been accidental" (p. 97, emphasis added). So how does Inglis explain it? "The most likely explanation is, of course, the perva sive pacifist sentiment that characterized Southern Song politics Given the sub sequent pacifist policies that prevailed (after Xiaozongs temporary employment of war faction officials in the 1160s) and the employment of more and more peace fac tion ministers at court, Hong Mai probably wished to avoid such sensitive political issues, particularly when we consider that the famous scholar-o伍cial Chen Liang 陳 亮（1143-1194) was scoffed at by high-ranking ministers at Xiaozongs court for hav ing submitted a pro-war memorial to the throne after 1174. Nevertheless, powerful loyalist sentiments discernable throughout the text reveal a gap between Hong's pro fessed intention and what he actually recorded" (pp. 97-98). And having persuaded himself that Hong Mai was terrorized into suppressing his innermost vision of the Record，Inglis can then conclude that ‘‘[a]lthough Hong never discusses [loyalism] in any of his prefaces—understandably so, the anti-Jurchen sentiment was so pow erful as to almost eclipse his ‘love of the strange’” (p. 121). Ingliss willingness to scuttle the solid evidence Hong Mai provides in his thirty-one prefaces about authorial intent in favor of circumstantial and unsub stantiated speculation is baffling, especially since analysis of the prefaces con stitutes the heart of his book. His discussion of the anti-Jurchen question also suggests that Inglis has not delved deeply enough into "the Song Dynasty Con text" that he claims as half of his books objective. To begin with, the use of the term "loyalism" or "loyalist voices” is misplaced in the context of the late twelfth century, for it suggests that antiwar officials—officials who had witnessed the costs of war and the ineffectiveness of the Song armies when they undertook offensive rather than defensive campaigns—were somehow disloyal. In fact, the term under debate during Hong Mais adult life was not loyalism but "recovery" (huifu 恢復)一specifically, the irredentist recovery of the northern territories lost to the Jin in 1127. These debates were complex and protracted, ebbing and flow</page><page sequence="6">Reviews 475 ing with the tide of Sino-Jurchen relations, but they were not debates to which Hong Mai contributed very much. His brother Hong Gua did, however, and like many thoughtful officials his position was equivocal, for while recovery of the north was no doubt desirable, he feared that neither Song troops nor resources were robust enough to accomplish that goal through direct military interven tion. Thus it was that in his brief stint as chief councilor, in late 1165-early 1166, Hong Gua supported a revised peace treaty with the Jin, so infuriating Zhu Xi (1130-1200) that Zhu backed out of an appointment as professor in the military academy and refused to accept office for the next fourteen years.5 Moreover, when Hong did take a stand on Song relations with the Jin, by rejecting vassalage ter minology during his embassy to the Jurchen in 1162, Inglis himself cites evidence that Hong's act of courage was short-lived: for after being incarcerated by the Jin without food for a mere three days, Hong capitulated, earning o伍cial denuncia tion and the public's scorn for failing to live up to his fathers example (pp. 14-15). If Inglis is right that it was fear that kept Hong from declaring his “loyalist” sen timents in his prefaces, then we must conclude that Hong was a timid loyalist indeed, for at this very same time contemporaries like Chen Liang, Ye Shi (1150 1223), and Zhu Xi were vociferously advocating the irredentist cause.6 These are not obscure issues, and it is surprising that Inglis did not read more widely or subject his hypothesis to greater scrutiny. Under the weight of Inglis's fixation with loyalism, even his usually sound technique of textual analysis fal ters. For example, although the Jurchen appear in many of Hong's anecdotes, his references to them do not become pejorative until the second collection (Yizhi) of 1166, following Wanyan Liangs abortive invasion of 1161 and Hongs own humiliation at Jurchen hands in 1162/ More centrally, in his analysis of the anec dote “Junior Guardian Wang” 王少保⑶力咖 bingzhi，p. 16), Inglis misinterprets "Zhang junwang” 張君王 as Chief Councilor Zhang Jun 張浚（1097-1164) rather than the homonymous General Zhang Jun 張俊(1086-1154), seriously skewing his argument (pp. 99-101). (He compounds his error in chapter 5 [p. 127], where he further confuses General Zhang with Junior Guardian Wang himself.) Ironically, although Inglis invokes General Zhang as one of Hongs "loyalist" symbols, of the four great generals associated with saving the Southern Song court in the 1130s, it was Zhang who broke with his irredentist colleagues Han Shizhong, Liu Guang shi, and Yue Fei to ally himself with Qin Gui and the accomodationists position.8 How much does this matter? In my view, it reflects an insufficient effort by Inglis to step outside his target text to identify the larger historical context. When exploring issues specific to the Record as text—issues of accuracy, taxonomy, and generic filiation—Ingliss scholarship appears solid and his analyses sound. But when he tries to locate the Record in its larger Song Dynasty context his research—and hence his analysis—falls short. Nonetheless, reading Ingliss book has reinforced my own idée fixe: what the Chinese history field really needs is a generous anthology of translations from the Record for use in the undergradu</page><page sequence="7">476 China Review International: Vol. 14, No. 2, Fall 2007 ate classroom, on the order of an earlier SUN Y anthology from the thirteenth century legal casebook the Qingming ji.9 Like the Qingmingji anthology, such a project would be best undertaken as a team effort. Based on this book, I would say that Inglis has earned a place on that team.
